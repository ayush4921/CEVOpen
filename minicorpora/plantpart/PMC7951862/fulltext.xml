The outcomes evaluated: feed intake, performance, body development, blood cells and metabolites, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), rumen fermentation, fecal scores, and respiratory scores. All outcomes were evaluated during pre-weaning (4&#x02013;60 d of age), and carry-over effects during post-weaning (61&#x02013;90 d of age) periods. The experimental units utilized were 29 newborn Holstein &#x000d7; Gyr crossbred dairy heifers, with genetic composition of 5/8 or more Holstein and 3/8 or less Gyr and body weight (BW) at birth of 32.2 &#x000b1; 5.2 kg. Experimental units were assigned to either a control (CON, n = 15) or a blend of essential oil supplementation (BEO, n = 14) treatment, maintaining a balance of genetic composition. The BEO was supplemented in the MR with 1 g/d/calf of a blend of essential oils (Apex Calf, Adisseo, China) composed by plant extracts derived from anise, cinnamon, garlic, rosemary, and thyme. During the pre-weaning phase, all heifers were fed 5 L of MR/d reconstituted to 15% (dry matter basis), divided into two equal meals. Water and starter were provided <italic>ad libitum</italic>. During the post-weaning, animals received a maximum of 3 kg of starter/d, and <italic>ad libitum</italic> corn silage, divided into two meals. Feed intake, fecal and respiratory scores were evaluated daily. The BW was measured every three days, while body development was recorded weekly. Blood samples were collected on 0, 30, and 60 d of age for total blood cell count, weekly and on the weaning day to determinate &#x000df;-hydroxybutyrate, urea and glucose, and biweekly for IGF-1. Ruminal parameters (pH, volatile fatty acids, ammonia-N, and acetate:propionate proportion&#x02014;C2:C3) were measured on days 14, 28, 42, 60, 74 and 90. A randomized complete block design with an interaction between treatment and week was the experimental method of choice to test the hypothesis of the BEO&#x02019;s effect on all outcomes. An ANOVA procedure was used for continuous outcomes, and a non-parametric test was used for the ordered categorical outcomes, both adopting a CI = 95%. Results indicated that there was not enough evidence to accept the alternative hypothesis of the effect of BEO in MR on feed intake, performance, body development, and blood metabolites during both pre-weaning and post-weaning periods. However, results indicated that the inclusion of BEO in MR significantly affects the proportion of C2:C3 during pre- and post-weaning (<italic>P</italic> = 0.05). Similarly, the effect was significant for basophil (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.001), and platelet (<italic>P</italic> = 0.04) counts pre-weaning. The interaction between week and treatment was also significant for lymphocytes (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.001), revealing a cumulative effect. Lastly, fecal scores were also significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.04) during pre-weaning, with lower values for BEO. The BEO contributed to ruminal manipulation in pre-weaning and carry-over effects in post-weaning, immunity improvement, and decreased morbidity of neonatal diarrhea in the pre-weaning phase.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003593</institution-id><institution>Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&#x000ed;fico e Tecnol&#x000f3;gico</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7081-382X</contrib-id><name><surname>Palhares Campolina</surname><given-names>Joana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007394</institution-id><institution>Instituto Nacional de Ci&#x000ea;ncia e Tecnologia de Ci&#x000ea;ncia Animal</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>Embrapa Dairy Cattle</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Magalh&#x000e3;es Campos</surname><given-names>Mariana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution>Bluestar Adisseo</institution></funding-source><award-id>20500.18/0005-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7081-382X</contrib-id><name><surname>Palhares Campolina</surname><given-names>Joana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This paper was financed by Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (EMBRAPA), Embrapa Dairy Cattle for funding this research and providing its facilities, and Adisseo Company for funding this research (project number: 20500.18/0005-2).

Average daily gain (ADG) and body weight (BW) at weaning are key metrics used to measure the success of the rearing program. It is well known that these parameters are related to the success of the rearing program, as well as the heifer&#x02019;s future milk production. Therefore, a bad life start can negatively impact animal adult performance [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Nutritional problems and neonatal diseases, especially diarrhea and respiratory syndrome, are some examples of negative impacts on the calf&#x02019;s young life. They can act as stressors, lowering calf immunity, increasing animal susceptibility to other disorders, and raise mortality rates [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, tools that help provide proper nutrition, and improve heifer development and health, are essential to reduce disease morbidity and mortality and accelerate the calf development. Additionally, since a calf is born functionally as a non-ruminant, the digestive system, and other organs and tissues, change in several weeks and the microbiota colonization changes to adapt to these transformations [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The bacteria in the rumen must start the fermentation of carbohydrates, so the calf can become dependent mostly on volatile fatty acids (VFA) and not on lactose-driven metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. For that matter, procedures that reduce the animal&#x02019;s susceptibility to pathogens and stressors, and help this pathway change, may improve future performance and productivity [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Since the discovery of the improvement in animal growth due to antibiotics almost 80 years ago, antibiotic growth promoters (AGP) have been widely used as a tool to improve both rumen development and animal health [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], prevent diseases, and increase performance and feed efficiency [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, the use of AGP in animal production for these purposes has been under severe criticism and banned in several countries [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The overuse of antimicrobial&#x02019;s concerns human health since there is already a well-established correlation between the increase of bacterial population resistance and the use of AGP, putting both humans and animals at risk [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The World Health Organization considers the antimicrobial resistance one of the three major threats to public health [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, the global trends in antimicrobial use show that some countries with the largest share of global antimicrobial consumption in food animals initiated a shift toward a more conservative use [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The EU banned the use of AGP since 2006 [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and the US published the Veterinary Feed Directive in 2015, which limited the use of AGP under the professional supervision of a licensed veterinarian [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and banned all medically important antimicrobials for humans in 2017 [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

Therefore, there is a motivation for more prudent use of antimicrobials [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and research for substitutes that can improve animal performance and health. A large number of new additives such as prebiotics and probiotics, organic acids, phytogenic substances, and essential oils have shown good results to improve animal production [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and appear to be a good alternative to decrease the use of AGP and alleviate the antimicrobial resistance [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

Lastly, essential oils have been shown to function similarly to ionophores, a type of AGP [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].

The genetic composition of the animal was included as a blocking effect. Birth month, birth body weight and Brix value were assessed only to verify if the animals were homogeneously distributed but were not used as a blocking effect. Birth weight and serum Brix value were tested as a covariate but did not improve statistical significance. Therefore, they were eliminated from the model. The effect of heifer within treatment was included in the models to account for individual variability.</p><p>The continuous outcomes such as intakes, structural growth, ruminal, and blood parameters were analyzed with ANOVA. A 95% Confidence Interval was adopted to verify the null hypothesis, and <italic>P</italic>-values were produced with a Fisher test. All outcomes were tested for normality to meet the required assumptions of this model, and a variable transformation was applied to milk replacer intakes to meet that assumption.</p><p>The categorical outcomes fecal and respiratory scores were analyzed using a non-parametric aligned rank transformation test, implemented in the R package ARTool. A 95% Confidence Interval was also adopted for the non-parametric tests. Associations between the fecal scores and MR intakes were assessed by using the Spearman correlations.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec011"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="sec012"><title>Intake and heifer performance</title><p>Most studies evaluate essential oils or a supplement with BEO to dairy calves, feed the additive in the starter to benefit rumen development, and accelerate growth. However, the intake of starter in the first weeks of age is small [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and the timing of the occurrence of enteric diseases is mainly on the first 30 days of life [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Due to the calf&#x02019;s limited capability of ingesting large solid feed amounts in the first days of life, the supplement intake in the starter could be limited, and the desired supplementation level may not be achieved based on intake levels of the starter. Therefore, in this trial, BEO was offered in the liquid diet since the aim was to verify if it would impact on disease morbidity and gut development, and subsequently, on animal&#x02019;s performance.</p><p>The supplemented heifers consumed the same amount of liquid diet as the control group, indicating no ingestibility issues of BEO (<xref rid="pone.0231068.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Differences described in the literature between flavor and palatability of BEOs could be due to the delivery method, as well as essential oil plant sources and extraction process [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Studies using different supplemented types of essential oils to other animal species&#x02019; reported different preferences and acceptability of these essential oils, with changes among animal species and category, juvenile x adults [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Previous work with weaned heifers supplemented with cinnamaldehyde essential oil in a total mix ration showed a preference in the taste of the ration without additive. This supplementation caused a change of feed intake, and it was related to palatability problems with the essential oil used in the experiment [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. However, although cinnamon is an ingredient that is in the mixture in our study, we did not run a palatability test to verify this outcome. It must be point also that the additive was given mixed with a small amount of MR to allow complete ingestion. Visually, the time on ingestion was the same, and all the calves consumed all MR. Therefore, ingestibility of the mixture was not a problem, However, further tests with essential oils palatability to dairy calves are needed.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0231068.t002"

differences in evaluated outcomes could be because of the supply route, dosage, or the essential oil plant sources and extraction process. It also must be highlighted that the starter provided contained monensin and other probiotic additives. They are important and efficient additives used not only as a growth promoter but also as coccidiosis control and prevention [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. However, some studies believe that the combined supplementation of monensin and essential oils could mask the effect of the essential oils or even compete for the same mechanisms of action [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In this study, no antagonism between additives was observed, as there were no negative responses for BEO compared to CON. It must also be highlighted that monensin was provided in the starter and the essential oil in the milk replacer. Thus, they would act in different compartments, the rumen and the intestines. To better understand this interaction and a possible effect, it is necessary for other studies to evaluate the impact of the essential oil&#x02019;s supplementation with or without monensin, as also the mechanism of action of the different essential oils.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Structural growth</title><p>Structural body growth was not affected by BEO supplementation in MR (<xref rid="pone.0231068.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) during pre- and post-weaning. As was also observed for intake and ADG, a week effect (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.001) was detected in all variables due to healthy animal growth. It was previously suggested that essential oils supplementation could only be effective in structural growth when associated with higher protein concentration in the starter due to an interaction between protein level supplementation and essential oils supplementation [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Other studies suggested that feeding essential oils could enhance growth performance if fed at an appropriate rate and in a determined amount [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In our study, the calves were fed with protein levels to meet their requirements for optimal growth. However, we did not test different protein levels to see if this interaction could change structural growth. On the other hand, in other species, the increase in structural growth, as well as daily weight gain and feed conversion for supplemented animals, are generally related to a more mature and developed gut. This more developed gut helps the supplement to be absorbed more quickly, improving gut immunity and microbiota, and as a consequence, the animals&#x02019; body growth [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Rumen fermentation</title><p>There were no differences in ruminal pH for CON and BEO treatments during the pre-weaning period.

Since there were no differences between treatments during pre-weaning, the carry-over effect may not be assumed to be the answer to this difference. Although no differences in intake were observed, heifers&#x02019; ingestion behavior might justify the difference in post-weaning pH. In other words, the amount of starter consumed before sampling and its impact on ruminal pH. However, this behavior was not evaluated since intake was measure only once every 24 hours.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0231068.t004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id

enhance essential oils effects, this could benefit younger calves that are supplemented with essential oils in the starter [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. It is also known that its supplementation is related to antimicrobial and antifungal effects [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Essential oils cause hydrophobicity and disrupt bacteria membrane, increasing water permeability and causing a toxic effect on the microorganism [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This activity could result in inhibition of ruminal deamination and methanogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This effect on the modulation of nitrogen path would result in a decrease of the ruminal nitrogen ammonia, methane and acetate concentrations and an increase of the propionate and butyrate concentrations [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Changes in these profiles in rumen fluid would also alter the acetate:propionate (C2:C3) proportions. Since butyrate and propionate are important for ruminal papillae development, and especially propionate is used in the gluconeogenesis route [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], a smaller C2:C3 ratio is wanted. In this experiment, BEO supplementation did not alter VFA values, but did reduced the C2:C3 proportion during the pre- (<italic>P</italic> = 0.05) and post-weaning phases (<italic>P</italic> = 0.006) (<xref rid="pone.0231068.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Confirming these findings, previous studies registered a lower C2:C3 proportion for calves in both groups supplemented with essential oils in the starter (1.56 and 1.47) compared with two control groups (2.02 and 1.77) [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. On the other hand, reports are not always constant in the literature, since higher C2:C3 proportion for pre-weaning calves supplemented with thyme essential oils (2.25 x 1.78) were already reported [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Despite our findings, it must be highlighted that, in our experiment, essential oils were provided mixed in small amounts of MR to ensure the whole intake of the product. If the BEO was provided in the starter, changes in the rumen would be expected. By providing the BEO in the MR, the treatment should bypass the rumen and have minimal impact on local ruminal microbiota and VFA. Nevertheless, since the MR amount was small and given at the beginning of the feeding, one hypothesis could be that the esophageal groove was still open, permitting essential oils content to arrive at the rumen. Another hypothesis could be a potential communication from the intestines and the forestomach were the nutrients on the lower gut caused adaptations on the upper gut, improving its function and growth, as well as nutrient use and differences in VFA proportions [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In monogastric animals, supplementation of essential oils has shown a direct effect on the gut microflora and effects on the gut-associated immune system, causing positive changes in nutrient digestibility and animal performance [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. A third theory to explain the changes in C2:C3 is that the changes in rumen could not be only by the BEO supplementation, but the interaction between the BEO and the monensin in the starter. They have a similar mechanism of actions and could cause the increase in propionate in the rumen, not enough to be seen when evaluating the VFA alone, but shifting ruminal fermentation and cause differences in C2:C3 proportions [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p><p>However, despite changes in C2:C3 proportions, nitrogen ammonia concentrations were not affected by BEO supplementation during pre- and post-weaning (<xref rid="pone.0231068.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Previous studies reported higher nitrogen ammonia for the treated group, suggesting that essential oils could not modulate deamination nor the population of ammonia producing bacteria [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. One of the characteristics of the essential oils is modulated ruminal microbiota and, consequently, fermentation and nutrient degradation in the forestomach [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p><p>For all ruminal parameters, a week effect during preweaning was observed (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.05, <xref rid="pone.0231068.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>).

the pre-weaning phase and decreased during the post-weaning period (<xref rid="pone.0231068.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Taking into account that calves use glucose as a primary source of energy in the firsts weeks of age, these age-related changes are associated with changes in diet and rumen development [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. After weaning, calves complete their rumen development and, VFA produced by ruminal microbiota becomes the primary energy source, justifying BHB concentration increase, and glucose concentration decrease [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. However, since there were changes in C2:C3 proportion in the BEO, the increase of propionic acid could consequently impact glucose blood concentration. Since essential oils can increase insulin sensitivity, not finding glucose differences between treatments does not mean that there were no changes in the glucose pathway [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Therefore, further investigations over these aspects are needed.</p><p>All blood cell counts were within normal range based on age and species normality. Changes in blood cell count are typical during heifer growth, and blood cells tend to increase with animal age [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. These changes corroborate with the week effect on mean corpuscular volume (MCV), basophils, eosinophils, segmented neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and platelets (<italic>P</italic> = 0.04). There were no differences in erythrogram parameters between BEO and CON (<xref rid="pone.0231068.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). Leukogram parameters showed decreased counts of basophil and platelet cells in BEO treatment (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.05). Basophils and platelets originate from different myeloid precursors and, both play essential roles in inflammation balance and immune response development in mammal [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The lower counts of basophil and platelets on BEO treatment may influence and modulate inflammatory response by secretion of immune modulators [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], growth factors, or chemotaxis on a variety of white blood cells [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. This modulation could help explain an interaction effect found for lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231068.g002">Fig 2</xref>), where values of d 30 and 60 were different from d 1 with an accentuated increase in BEO.

Coronavirus, rotavirus, <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp. and/or <italic>Cryptosporidium parvum</italic> are the most common agents under 14 d of age. <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp., <italic>Eimeria</italic> spp. and/or <italic>Giardia</italic> spp. are the most common pathogens in older calves [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>].</p><p>The supplementation of essential oils has already shown beneficial results for lowering diarrhea and fecal scores in other species with the same efficiency of AGPs [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. For piglets, where this is a prevalent disease and caused by similar agents as in calves, it has been shown favorable results with lower diarrhea prevalence for treated animals [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. In our study, the average age for diarrhea (scores 2 and 3) occurrence was 12.2 &#x000b1; 3.6 d for BEO and 13.6 &#x000b1; 3.8 d for CON with no statistical difference (<italic>P</italic> = 0.54). Diarrhea incidence on pre-weaning in BEO treatment was 85% against 93% for CON treatment with no statistical difference (<italic>P</italic> = 0.68). The fecal score was different between treatments (<italic>P</italic> = 0.04), with lower values for BEO, and changed over time (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.001, <xref rid="pone.0231068.t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>). Days with diarrhea (scores 2 and 3, <italic>P</italic> = 0.24) and days with severe diarrhea (score 3, <italic>P</italic> = 0.12) were not different between treatments (<xref rid="pone.0231068.t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>). Three animals of each treatment were medicated for diarrhea with anti-inflammatories, and the therapy duration was 1.6 &#x000b1; 0.57 d for BEO and 3.0 &#x000b1; 1 d for CON. It is noteworthy that this treatment was done outside the hemogram and total cell count evaluation in this study. Besides no differences in the diarrhea prevalence, the lower fecal score in the BEO could point to better gut health and less microbiota disability [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. However, is important to point out that we did not collect samples to analyze microbiota changes before, during, and after diarrhea, or pathogenic bacteria count in feces.</p><p>Evaluation of the respiratory score parameters indicated that 2 BEO animals and 1 of CON animals exceeded score 4, indicating respiratory disease on pre-weaning. The average days with a high score were 1.0 &#x000b1; 0 d for BEO and CON. No effect was found on days with high respiratory score or number of affected animals. However, a week and an interaction week x treatment effect on pre-weaning was observed, with the difference between treatment scores and lower values for the BEO in week 2 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.02, <xref rid="pone.0231068.t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231068.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The second week was the period in which animals had a higher incidence of diarrhea. It is known that diarrhea and respiratory problems are caused by a combination of factors and related to the immunity status, nutrition, type of housing, and season [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Herds with respiratory diseases in calves have more diarrheal disease [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Thus, in this trial, the respiratory signs could be related to the previous enteric disease. Weeks 5 and 6 showed a lower score difference between treatments and a lower incidence of respiratory signs. The number of treated animals was 2 for BEO only during the preweaning period, with an average of treatment days of 1.3 &#x000b1; 1.4, and 3 for CON with an average of treatment days of 2.0 &#x000b1; 0.57. Treatments occurred only in the pre-weaning period using antibiotics and anti-inflammatories.</p><p>Pneumonia is usually associated with the post-weaning phase. However, it may affect younger calves [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Post-weaning respiratory scores revealed higher mean values when compared with pre-weaning, but no animals had scores above 4. There was a week effect (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.001), in week 12, probably due to weaning and dehorning stress.</p><p>It has been reported that essential oils have an antiseptic and antimicrobial activity that may help balance intestinal microbiota [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Gram-positive bacteria are the most sensitive to the essential oils microbial activity [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], but Gram-negative bacteria and some types of parasites can also be susceptible [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] to different essential oils. Thus, some essential oils could reduce the incidence and severity of diarrhea syndrome in calves through inhibition of coliform overgrowth [<xref rid="pone.0231068.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. The in vitro test with BEO in 1.0 &#x003bc;g/mL concentration did not inhibit bacterial growth&#x02013;both <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>Typhimurium</italic>. Thus, at this concentration, BEO did not have any direct antibacterial effect. However, besides no direct influence found over the bacterial evaluation, BEO calves presented differences on basophil (<xref rid="pone.0231068.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>) and lymphocyte cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231068.g002">Fig 2</xref>), which could be associated with modulation of the inflammatory immune response. Thus, outcomes found on fecal and respiratory scores could be related to indirect changes in hemato-biochemical parameters and not with a direct antibacterial effect.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec017"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Feeding BEO to pre-weaned heifers on MR did not affect intake, performance parameters, blood metabolites, or IGF-1 concentration. However, it changed C2:C3 proportion during pre- and post-weaning periods, showed signs of immunity improvement, and lower fecal scores in the pre-weaning phase. Therefore, essential oils are a health additive option to modern production systems and could be used as an alternative to improve calf health and performance. Further research is needed to define the best route and dosage, understand the contribution of essential oils to decrease neonatal diseases&#x02019; morbidity, and verify the possible interaction with other molecules.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0231068.s001"><label>S1 Data</label><caption><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0231068.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0231068.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Khan</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Weary</surname><given-names>DM</given-names></name>, <name><surname>von Keyserlingk</surname><given-names>MAG</given-names></name>. <article-title>Invited review: Effects of milk ration on solid feed intake, weaning, and performance in dairy heifers</article-title>. <source>J Dairy Sci</source>. <year>2011</year>;<volume>94</volume>: <fpage>1071</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>1081</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.3168/jds.2010-3733</pub-id>

(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #1: Overall, the topic is relevant and the objective stood to contribute to the exploration of bioactive ingredients as an alternative to antimicrobials. However, the presentation of the results and discussion lacked substance and did not accurately convey outcome or inferences for future use. Erring on benefit of the doubt with respect to translation difficulties; please extensively review for spelling, grammar and context. It was especially hard to follow logic and connection between referenced work and the results observed in the paper during the discussion. The authors have done good research but significant and major English editing and organization is needed. I have made some recommendations for edits but do not consider it an exhaustive list of what could be changed.</p><p>Are there any references from swine or poultry that could be used throughout this paper that would integrate into the concepts you are trying to address? It is a fairly new area of interest in calves but here is a more prevalent publications in these other species.</p><p>Inconsistency with how references are cited within manuscript. PLoS one says to use reference numbers, but the use of author names and numbers varies throughout. If able to streamline without compromising word flow, please do so.</p><p>Do not start sentences with abbreviations.</p><p>Italicize &#x0201c;P&#x0201d; values throughout</p><p>Line 43, 115, 137-138, 282-284: you indicate that this is a complete block design but you enrolled different numbers of animals between the two treatments. Can you explain this? Were any animals enrolled and not used in the final dataset?</p><p>Title</p><p>Line 3: add &#x0201c;,&#x0201d; after &#x0201c;blood parameters&#x0201d;</p><p>Abstract</p><p>Line 28: &#x0201c;on&#x0201d; should be &#x0201c;during&#x0201d;</p><p>Line 33: insert a space between with1</p><p>Is commercial name needed here? May be more beneficial to list oils included in mixture?</p><p>Was BEO supplied in MR?</p><p>Line 34: should be reconstituted to 15% not &#x0201c;at&#x0201d;</p><p>Line 37: Delete &#x0201c;The outcomes&#x0201d;</p><p>Line 42: &#x0201c;each&#x0201d; should be every. You have 14 days listed here but that is different from what is described in the materials and methods. Please rectify.</p><p>Line 46-48: The terminology used here saying you accept the alternative hypothesis is inappropriate. Either fail to reject or reject the null.</p><p>Line 51: Tense switch from past to present; change &#x0201c;is&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;was&#x0201d; after &#x0201c;effect&#x0201d;.</p><p>Line 51-55: italicize P values. Are P-values in abstract allowed in Plos One?</p><p>Line 53: what does long-term mean? How does your data support long term immunological effects?</p><p>Introduction</p><p>Lines 60-68: This paragraph does not really add to the justification for the objectives addressed in this paper; consider starting introduction at Line 69 instead.</p><p>Line 70: insert a &#x0201c;,&#x0201d; after mortality rates</p><p>Line 71-72: Consider rewording to make more sense chronologically: &#x0201c;Therefore, tools that improve calf development and health are essential to reduce disease, mortality and morbidity as well as accelerate heifer development.&#x0201d;</p><p>Line 73: insert &#x0201c;as a&#x0201d; between functionally and non-ruminant, delete &#x0201c;it must have its&#x0201d; and replace with &#x0201c;the&#x0201d;, the rest of that sentence needs to be reworded for clarity.</p><p>Line 77: Remove &#x0201c;anymore&#x0201d;.</p><p>Line 78: Remove &#x0201c;Since&#x0201d; Is there a reference(s) for this statement?</p><p>Line 85-87: Remove entire sentence starting with &#x0201c;Furthermore&#x02026;&#x0201d;. I think this statement is not based on fact but opinion. There are no differences between the health benefits of cows managed under an organic system vs a system that utilizes antibiotics. Are there references for these statements?</p><p>The entire paragraph (lines 78-88) has the potential to be a slippery slope discussion regarding antibiotics so be careful with what you choose to include and how you make relation to natural alternatives. I think it could be framed in a much different context to discuss examples like the Veterinary Feed Directive in the US or limits on antibiotics as growth promoters are being phased out if not already illegal.</p><p>Line 84: Change &#x0201c;over&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;on&#x0201d;.</p><p>Line 85-87: Mention of organic dairy farms is extraneous and should be removed. This statement has no bearing on overall objective of this paper.</p><p>Line 91: change &#x0201c;on&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;with&#x0201d;</p><p>Line 93: change &#x0201c;for&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;to&#x0201d;</p><p>Line 94: &#x02018;Leucocyte&#x0201d; should be &#x0201c;leukocyte&#x0201d;</p><p>Line 95: Suggest &#x0201c;Lastly, essential oils have been shown to function similarly to ionophores by influencing&#x02026;&#x0201d;</p><p>Line 100: change &#x0201c;over&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;on&#x0201d;</p><p>Line 106: the word &#x02018;influence&#x02019; alone is unclear; was positive or negative influence hypothesized?</p><p>Materials and Methods</p><p>Line 120-121: &#x02018;up to&#x02019; should be &#x02018;before&#x02019;</p><p>Line 122: &#x0201c;At 2 to 3 d of age&#x0201d; should be &#x0201c;From 2 to 3 d of age&#x0201d; Correct? You fed transition milk on d 2 and 3?</p><p>Line 125, 200: the g should be italicized also is this g force value correct? I think it is rpm. It is different than other locations throughout materials and methods. Please verify.</p><p>Line 127: you state that only heifers with a high enough Brix value were enrolled. Were there any heifers that were not enrolled because of this criteria?</p><p>Line 129-130: was intake recorded of water and starter? When were these first offered?</p><p>Line 132: recommend &#x0201c;On d 4 of age, heifers were assigned to one of two experimental milk replacers. Both milk replacers were fed at a rate of 5 L/d&#x02026;&#x0201d; May be able to reorganize and consolidate text you have on line 135. Feeding rate could be described after description of treatment milk replacers</p><p>Line 135: replace &#x0201c;with&#x0201d; with &#x0201c;at&#x0201d;</p><p>Line 136- you state serum total protein but you actually measured Brix correct?</p><p>Line 137: How was dosage of 1g/calf/d determined? Is it manufacturer recommendation? Suggest addition of &#x0201c;or a commercial blend of essential oils supplemented at a rate of 1 g/calf/d (BEO; Apex..)</p><p>Line 138: Delete &#x0201c;Apex Calf&#x0201d; from the second half of that line. Recommend &#x0201c;The BEO is a dry powder&#x02026;&#x0201d;</p><p>Line 140: essential oil &#x0201c;for&#x0201d; each meal</p><p>Line 141: milk or milk replacer? Were calves fed the control diet fed and treated in a similar way or did they receive their whole meal at one time? Did this influence timing of feeding between treatments that might influence blood measurements collected relative to feeding?</p><p>Table 1: Is this analyzed composition? Table heading should stand alone, suggest addition of &#x0201c;fed to calves&#x0201d;. You said you took samples for nutrient analysis but did not present standard deviations of feed ingredients. &#x0201c;unless otherwise noted&#x0201d; can be deleted. Extra space between % of in Organic matter heading. Was starch measured? It would be a good addition to analysis. Superscript 1 is not required. Superscript 2- if commercial milk can you provide brand name and company? Starter ingredients I think it is useful to know but not sure if entire list is necessary in this case.</p><p>Line 153 and 158: starter is listed to have monensin and a probiotic additive. How does this impact your treatments? Any consideration for this when interpreting your results? In intro you discuss ionophores&#x02026; but do not say anything further.</p><p>Line 180: inconsistent use of &#x0201c;body development&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;structural growth&#x0201d;. I think structural growth more appropriate for the measures you collected</p><p>Line 181: &#x0201c;birth date&#x0201d; should be &#x0201c;day of birth&#x0201d;. BW measurements every 3 d needs a bit more clarification. How was this handled for analysis? Did the day BW was collected continually change day of week?</p><p>Line 192: Introduction states that rumen fluid was collected every 2 wk; however, collection days listed do not follow a 14-day pattern. Days listed are 14, 28, 42, 60, 74, and 90; a 14-day pattern would be 14, 28, 42, 56, 70 and 84. If samples were collected in a different timeframe than originally stated, please discuss. It seems as though the later collection dates were adjusted to account for collection on days that calves were weaned (60d) and also at the end of the collection period (90).</p><p>Line 198: spelling error; &#x02018;termo&#x02019; should be &#x0201c;Thermo&#x0201d;. Add &#x0201c;WI&#x0201d; after &#x0201c;Madison.&#x0201d;</p><p>Line 206- insert &#x0201c;3 h after morning feeding&#x0201d; after collected</p><p>Line 207: &#x0201c;feed&#x0201d; should be &#x0201c;ingestion&#x0201d;</p><p>Blood samples not collected in weekly increments as stated in abstract; collection days after baseline collection at day 4 follow 7 day pattern until d 63, then are collected 11, 7 and 9 d later instead of consistently 7. Correct throughout to represent what was actually done.</p><p>Line 209: Collection days again do not match up to the initial 2-week timeframe stated for IGF-1 determination. Fluctuates between 7 and 14 day collection. Correct this throughout</p><p>Line 222: essay should be assay</p><p>Line 227: perform should be evaluate or analyze</p><p>Line 235: delete &#x0201c;it was also performed&#x0201d; and add &#x0201c;were calculated&#x0201d; at the end of the sentence.</p><p>Line 244: here you indicate classification of severe diarrhea but terminology used in results and discussion is different so could you clarify between the two sections of text what &#x0201c;severity&#x0201d; of diarrhea you are discussing please?</p><p>Line 255: &#x0201c;Final respiratory score considered the sum of all punctuations&#x0201d; should be reworded to &#x0201c;A final respiratory score was determined by the summation of all scores&#x0201d;. However could you clarify if diarrhea score was included in this or not? Maybe list which scores when into the final sum?</p><p>Line 257: What antibiotic was used, what dosage, how long?</p><p>Line 258 and 261: &#x0201c;subsequently&#x0201d; should be sequential</p><p>Line 260: What is &#x02018;pulmonary commitment&#x02019;?</p><p>Line 263: Consider moving this section to earlier in materials and methods section and discuss more about why it was used. Was this used to determine dosage?</p><p>Line 267: No footnote number after author reference; inconsistent with remainder of manuscript and instructions to authors</p><p>Line 269: is the tween from a specific company?</p><p>Line 290: Weren&#x02019;t all the animals of similar genetic composition? Why was this used as a blocking effect?</p><p>Line 294-295: Rephrase &#x0201c;accept or deny&#x0201d;</p><p>Line 297-298: were mean values that were transformed presented as back transformed values?

Thinking about diarrhea in calves occurring mainly in first 3 wk of life and limited starter intake during this time which would support inclusion in milk if to benefit this situation. What about timing and main use of antibiotics relative to these health events? That is a main motivation for use of essential oils correct?</p><p>Line 311-312: how was this determined? Not described</p><p>Line 316: Total mixed ration instead of total mixed ratio</p><p>Line 319: consider changing &#x02018;supply&#x02019; to &#x02018;delivery method&#x02019; to be more clear</p><p>Line 332-333: there is no description of a correlation in stats section.

The company organization did not play a role in the study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript and only provided financial support in the form of research materials. They also do not have any decision on the sharing of data and materials. The two authors that are employed by a commercial company helped with providing materials for the trial on the revision to publish the article.</p><p>Reviewer #1: Overall, the topic is relevant, and the objective stood to contribute to the exploration of bioactive ingredients as an alternative to antimicrobials. However, the presentation of the results and discussion lacked substance and did not accurately convey outcome or inferences for future use. Erring on benefit of the doubt with respect to translation difficulties; please extensively review for spelling, grammar and context. It was especially hard to follow logic and connection between referenced work and the results observed in the paper during the discussion. The authors have done good research but significant and major English editing and organization is needed. I have made some recommendations for edits but do not consider it an exhaustive list of what could be changed.</p><p>Au: Thank you for your concern. We have made an extensive English re-editing and reviewing for spelling, grammar, and organizing the ideas to fit the context. We reorganized sentences and added new information to enrich the discussion.</p><p>Are there any references from swine or poultry that could be used throughout this paper that would integrate into the concepts you are trying to address? It is a fairly new area of interest in calves but here is a more prevalent publications in these other species.</p><p>Au: Thank you for your concern. We added information concerning other species, as well as new releases in calves&#x02019; studies supplemented with essential oils</p><p>Inconsistency with how references are cited within manuscript. PLoS one says to use reference numbers, but the use of author names and numbers varies throughout. If able to streamline without compromising word flow, please do so.</p><p>Au: Thank you for your concern. Edited. Although PloS One accepts author&#x02019;s name in the text, we agree that taking them out helped with word flow. </p><p>Do not start sentences with abbreviations.</p><p>Italicize &#x0201c;P&#x0201d; values throughout</p><p>Au: Edited. Thank you.</p><p>Line 43, 115, 137-138, 282-284: you indicate that this is a complete block design but you enrolled different numbers of animals between the two treatments. Can you explain this? Were any animals enrolled and not used in the final dataset?</p><p>Au: Thank you for your contribution. Initially, we enrolled 15 animals in each treatment, with a total of 30 animals. However, one heifer form BEO treatment was not growing and had struggled with innumerous wealth problems. She was then euthanized, and it was discovered that she had a malformation of her intestinal tract. Because of that matter, she was taken out of the study. A new heifer was not enrolled in her place since the trial was already going on, and the animals were at least 30 days old. Enrolling a new animal after that long could change animal behave and performance due to contact with older animals. We also started the trial in March, which is fall in Brazil. If we decided to enroll a new animal, she would be born in winter. For those reasons, we decided then to have an unbalanced design. (L44, 128, 152-154, 302-304).</p><p>Title</p><p>Line 3: add &#x0201c;,&#x0201d; after &#x0201c;blood parameters&#x0201d;</p><p>Au: Included, thank you. (L3).</p><p>Abstract</p><p>Line 28: &#x0201c;on&#x0201d; should be &#x0201c;during&#x0201d;</p><p>Au: Edited, thank you. (L28).</p><p>Line 33: insert a space between with1</p><p>Au: Included, thank you. (L32).</p><p>Is commercial name needed here? May be more beneficial to list oils included in mixture?</p><p>Au: Thank you for your contribution. We choose to put the commercial name of the used product since some papers do essential oil extract and can have different results. We do have which extracts plants compose the product. However, we think if we put which product we used, it can give more information to the reader. However, also added the plant extracts that component to the abstract: &#x0201c;composed by plant extracts derived from anise, cinnamon, garlic, rosemary and thyme&#x0201d; (L33-34).</p><p>Was BEO supplied in MR?</p><p>Au: Thank you for your contribution. On line 24, we said that the BEO was supplied in MR. However, to help a better understanding of the text, we also added at L32.</p><p>Line 34: should be reconstituted to 15% not &#x0201c;at&#x0201d;</p><p>Au: Edited, thank you. (L35)</p><p>Line 37: Delete &#x0201c;The outcomes&#x0201d;</p><p>Au: Edited, thank you. (L38).</p><p>Line 42: &#x0201c;each&#x0201d; should be every. You have 14 days listed here but that is different from what is described in the materials and methods. Please rectify.</p><p>Au: Edited, thank you (L43).</p><p>Line 46-48: The terminology used here saying you accept the alternative hypothesis is inappropriate. Either fail to reject or reject the null.</p><p>Au: Thank you for your concern. We edited to hypothesis to a more appropriate terminology (L48-50).</p><p>Line 51: Tense switch from past to present; change &#x0201c;is&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;was&#x0201d; after &#x0201c;effect&#x0201d;.</p><p>Au: Edited, thank you (L52)</p><p>Line 51-55: italicize P values. Are P-values in abstract allowed in Plos One?</p><p>Au: Edited, thank you (L52-54, 56). We also check on PlosOne submission rules, and they do not say about allowing it or not P-values, but they said the abstract should: &#x0201c;Summarize the most important results and their significance.&#x0201d; We also found other papers already publish in PlosOne that used P-values in the abstract: Pone.0191687 and Pone.0146488. Therefore, we thought that it would be interesting to leave the P-values (L 52-55).</p><p>Line 53: what does long-term mean? How does your data support long term immunological effects?</p><p>Au: We apologize for the misunderstanding. We reformulated the sentence to make clear the statements (L54-55). </p><p>Introduction</p><p> Lines 60-68: This paragraph does not really add to the justification for the objectives addressed in this paper; consider starting introduction at Line 69 instead.</p><p>Au: Thank you for your contribution. The manly parameters evaluated in a good calf rearing program are average dairy gain and disease incidence. Since we also did in this trial, we thought that it would be nice to explain why they are so important and why we choose to measure them. It is also important to point that we did measure immune system parameters, and those are highly correlated with weight gain and animal&#x02019;s health. For that reason, we decided to keep this paragraph (L61-70)</p><p>Line 70: insert a &#x0201c;,&#x0201d; after mortality rates</p><p>Au: Included, thank you (L33)</p><p>Line 71-72: Consider rewording to make more sense chronologically: &#x0201c;Therefore, tools that improve calf development and health are essential to reduce disease, mortality and morbidity as well as accelerate heifer development.&#x0201d;</p><p>Au: We apologize for the misunderstanding. We reformulated the sentence to make clear the statement (L72-73).</p><p>Line 73: insert &#x0201c;as a&#x0201d; between functionally and non-ruminant, delete &#x0201c;it must have its&#x0201d; and replace with &#x0201c;the&#x0201d;, the rest of that sentence needs to be reworded for clarity.</p><p>Au: Thank you for your contribution. We reformulated the whole sentence (L73-75).</p><p>Line 77: Remove &#x0201c;anymore&#x0201d;.</p><p>Au: Edited, thank you (L77)</p><p>Line 78: Remove &#x0201c;Since&#x0201d; Is there a reference(s) for this statement?</p><p>Au: Edited, thank you. The reference for that statement comes in the next sentence (Drackely, 2008). However, we added at the end of the sentence to be precise (L70).</p><p>Line 85-87: Remove entire sentence starting with &#x0201c;Furthermore&#x02026;&#x0201d;. I think this statement is not based on fact but opinion. There are no differences between the health benefits of cows managed under an organic system vs a system that utilizes antibiotics. Are there references for these statements?</p><p>The entire paragraph (lines 78-88) has the potential to be a slippery slope discussion regarding antibiotics so be careful with what you choose to include and how you make relation to natural alternatives. I think it could be framed in a much different context to discuss examples like the Veterinary Feed Directive in the US or limits on antibiotics as growth promoters are being phased out if not already illegal.</p><p>Au: Thank you for your suggestion. We have re-edited the entire paragraph and accepted your context suggestion (L80-94).</p><p>Line 84: Change &#x0201c;over&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;on&#x0201d;.</p><p>Au: Thank you. We reformulate this paragraph to meet your suggestions.</p><p>Line 85-87: Mention of organic dairy farms is extraneous and should be removed. This statement has no bearing on overall objective of this paper.</p><p>Au: Thank you for your suggestion. We agree that this statement is not the main objective of this paper, so we remove it.</p><p>Line 91: change &#x0201c;on&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;with&#x0201d;</p><p>Au: Edited, thank you (L98).</p><p>Line 93: change &#x0201c;for&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;to&#x0201d;</p><p>Au: Edited, thank you (L100).</p><p>Line 94: &#x02018;Leucocyte&#x0201d; should be &#x0201c;leukocyte&#x0201d;</p><p>Au: Edited, thank you (L101).</p><p>Line 95: Suggest &#x0201c;Lastly, essential oils have been shown to function similarly to ionophores by influencing&#x02026;&#x0201d;</p><p>Au: Edited, thank you (L101-102).</p><p>Line 100: change &#x0201c;over&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;on&#x0201d;</p><p>Au: Edited, thank you (L107).</p><p>Line 106: the word &#x02018;influence&#x02019; alone is unclear; was positive or negative influence hypothesized?</p><p>Au: We apologize for the misunderstanding. We reformulated the sentence to make clear the statement. (L118)</p><p>Materials and Methods</p><p>Line 120-121: &#x02018;up to&#x02019; should be &#x02018;before&#x02019; </p><p>Au: Edited, thank you (L134)</p><p>Line 122: &#x0201c;At 2 to 3 d of age&#x0201d; should be &#x0201c;From 2 to 3 d of age&#x0201d; Correct? You fed transition milk on d 2 and 3?</p><p>Au: Edited, thank you. We fed colostrum on the first day, transitional milk on the second and third, and started with the milk replacer on the fourth. (L136)</p><p>Line 125, 200: the g should be italicized also is this g force value correct? I think it is rpm. It is different than other locations throughout materials and methods. Please verify.</p><p>Au: Thank you for your concern. Edited. The relative centrifugal force (RFC) is generated when a particle is subjected to a circular motion. The unit of measurement of the RCF is g, which is equivalent to the acceleration of gravity on the Earth's surface. Thus, the speed of a centrifuge will be provided in RCF (or g-force) or rotations per minute (rpm). (L140, 230). </p><p>Line 127: you state that only heifers with a high enough Brix value were enrolled. </p><p>Au: Thank you for your concern. Yes, only heifers with high Brix were enrolled (L142-143)</p><p>Were there any heifers that were not enrolled because of this criteria?</p><p>Au: Thank you for your concern. Only one heifer did not meet the Brix criteria, so she was taken out of the trial. Since we were evaluating animal&#x02019;s performance as well, immune function and health, it was vital that all animals had had a proper colostrum management. Therefore, the results obtained would not be influenced by that variable.</p><p>Line 129-130: was intake recorded of water and starter? When were these first offered?</p><p>Au: Thank you for your concern. Water and starter intake values, both from pre-weaning and post-weaning, are available in table 2. All animals receive ad libitum water and starter during pre-weaning. And ad libitum water and 3 kg of starter on post-weaning. Water and starter were available since day 0 of the trial (L144-146).</p><p>Line 132: recommend &#x0201c;On d 4 of age, heifers were assigned to one of two experimental milk replacers. Both milk replacers were fed at a rate of 5 L/d&#x02026;&#x0201d; May be able to reorganize and consolidate text you have on line 135. Feeding rate could be described after description of treatment milk replacers.</p><p>Au: Thank you for your contribution. We reformulated the paragraph (L147-163). However, we did not say that there were two different milk replaces since they were the same. The difference was that in the BEO treatment, we added the blend of essential oil additive.</p><p>Line 135: replace &#x0201c;with&#x0201d; with &#x0201c;at&#x0201d;</p><p>Au: Thank you for your concern. We edited the paragraph (L147-163).</p><p>Line 136- you state serum total protein but you actually measured Brix correct?</p><p>Au: Thank you for your contribution. Sorry for the misunderstanding. We corrected the sentence and other places of the text. It was measured Brix value to evaluate the success of the passive immune transfer (L148).</p><p>Line 137: How was dosage of 1g/calf/d determined? Is it manufacturer recommendation? Suggest addition of &#x0201c;or a commercial blend of essential oils supplemented at a rate of 1 g/calf/d (BEO; Apex.)</p><p>Au: Edited, thank you (L153). We used the manufacturer's recommendation. We also add that information to the text (L154).</p><p>Line 138: Delete &#x0201c;Apex Calf&#x0201d; from the second half of that line. Recommend &#x0201c;The BEO is a dry powder&#x02026;&#x0201d;</p><p>Au: Edited, thank you (L154). We choose to keep &#x0201c;blend of essential oils&#x0201d; not to confuse with the experimental group abbreviation.</p><p>Line 140: essential oil &#x0201c;for&#x0201d; each meal</p><p>Au: Edited, thank you (L156).</p><p>Line 141: milk or milk replacer? Were calves fed the control diet fed and treated in a similar way or did they receive their whole meal at one time? Did this influence timing of feeding between treatments that might influence blood measurements collected relative to feeding?</p><p>Au: We apologize for the misunderstanding. We reformulate the sentence to make clear the statement (L157). All animals received milk replacer. Feeding time was at the same time. Animals were feed from the youngest to the oldest, always obeying this order. We also colored code the feeding buckets and washed them separately to avoid product residue to be feed to an animal, not in the treatment group. Feeding all animals would not last more than half an hour. So, we do think that did not influence blood measurements since we also did sampling from the youngest to the oldest. Animals from BEO treatment received 0.5L mixed with the blend of essential oil, and a bucket was put in front of their stall with the other 2.0 L. One person was responsible for refilling the milk bucket after they finished. Animals from the control group received the 2.5 L all at once. However, since we would refill the BEO group as soon as they finish, there were no differences in time and amount of milk replacer intake.</p><p>Table 1: Is this analyzed composition? Table heading should stand alone, suggest addition of &#x0201c;fed to calves&#x0201d;. You said you took samples for nutrient analysis but did not present standard deviations of feed ingredients. &#x0201c;unless otherwise noted&#x0201d; can be deleted. Extra space between % of in Organic matter heading. Was starch measured? It would be a good addition to analysis. Superscript 1 is not required. Superscript 2- if commercial milk can you provide brand name and company? Starter ingredients I think it is useful to know but not sure if entire list is necessary in this case.</p><p>Au: Thank you for your concern. We did not present the standard deviations od the ingredients since we have noticed in other Plos One papers&#x02019; this is not a normal practice (Pone.0234610 and Pone.0179940).</p><p>Unfortunately, we did not measure starch. Due to COVID-19, the laboratories and research facilities are closed, not allowing us to and it. </p><p>We have taken superscript 1 out. The commercial milk replacer name is provided in the text, but we added on subscription. We decided to leave the entire list so readers can check starter quality.</p><p>Line 153 and 158: starter is listed to have monensin and a probiotic additive. How does this impact your treatments? Any consideration for this when interpreting your results? In intro you discuss ionophores&#x02026; but do not say anything further.</p><p>Au: Thank you for your concern. We wanted to give a good quality starter and a starter used by farmers. Monensin is an important and efficient growth promoter antibiotic used to prevent coccidiosis and increase performance. Therefore, most of the starters used in Brazil today contain this additive. Since both treatments received the starter containing monesin, and there were no differences for starter intake, we think that this did not impact our results. It shows that there was no antagonism between both additives. It must be highlight also that since monsein was provided at the start, it would go to the rumen. The essential oils blend was provided in the milk replacer so that it would go to the intestines. Thus, the target for the action of both additives would be different. We have cited ionophores in the intro since it is expected that the essential oils present similar results. However, we think more studies must evaluate the comparison between essential oils and other additives, as well as the evaluation of interactions of the combined use of both molecules (L170-177).</p><p>Line 180: inconsistent use of &#x0201c;body development&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;structural growth&#x0201d;. I think structural growth more appropriate for the measures you collected.</p><p>Au: Thank you for your contribution. We revised the paper and change body development to structural growth (L198).</p><p>Line 181: &#x0201c;birth date&#x0201d; should be &#x0201c;day of birth&#x0201d;. BW measurements every 3 d needs a bit more clarification. How was this handled for analysis? Did the day BW was collected continually change day of week?</p><p>Au: Thank you for your concern. We chose to measure the BW every 3 days so that way we would have a more accurate measurement of the weight gain and over diseases impact over it. The measurement was calculated using the day of the calf birth and adding 3 more days after every weight. For that reason, there was not a specific day to weight the calves. That would vary according to its day of birth (L 199).</p><p>Line 192: Introduction states that rumen fluid was collected every 2 wk; however, collection days listed do not follow a 14-day pattern. Days listed are 14, 28, 42, 60, 74, and 90; a 14-day pattern would be 14, 28, 42, 56, 70 and 84. If samples were collected in a different timeframe than originally stated, please discuss. It seems as though the later collection dates were adjusted to account for collection on days that calves were weaned (60d) and also at the end of the collection period (90).</p><p>Au: Thank you for your concern. We adjusted to the main text to fit a better explanation. The sample collection was adjusted on the days that the calves were weaned. So, the pattern was 14, 28, 42, 60, 74, and 90 (L210).</p><p>Line 198: spelling error; &#x02018;termo&#x02019; should be &#x0201c;Thermo&#x0201d;.

Correct throughout to represent what was actually done.</p><p>Au: Thank you for your contribution. We revised the paper and saw that we specify the wrong days. We have taken a blood sample on day 0 that worked as a baseline before treatment. The sample of day 4 was used only to check blood Brix value. For the following days, we collected every 7 days and on the weaning day. For the post-weaning period, animals were collected based on the weaning day, which was day 60. Since the last blood collection on day 88, but animals would be out of the trial on day 90, we have pushed that blood sampling for 2 days. We corrected (L225-227).</p><p>Line 209: Collection days again do not match up to the initial 2-week timeframe stated for IGF-1 determination. Fluctuates between 7 and 14 day collection. Correct this throughout</p><p>Au: Thank you for your contribution. Also, as cited above, there was a miscommunication with the exact days of blood sampling. Samples for IGF-1 were taken on the day of birth as a baseline, and after that, every 14 days. Since day 56 was close to day 60 (the weaning day), it was chosen just to use the sample form day 60 since it would change that much. Sampling on the post-weaning phase took the weaning day as a basis, and for the same reason that happened during the pre-weaning phase, we choose to use the sampling that would be on day 88 and push it to day 90 (L226-227).</p><p>Line 222: essay should be assay</p><p>Au: Edited, thank you (L239).</p><p>Line 227: perform should be evaluate or analyze</p><p>Au: Edited, thank you (L244).</p><p>Line 235: delete &#x0201c;it was also performed&#x0201d; and add &#x0201c;were calculated&#x0201d; at the end of the sentence.</p><p>Au: Edited, thank you (L252).</p><p>Line 244: here you indicate classification of severe diarrhea but terminology used in results and discussion is different so could you clarify between the two sections of text what &#x0201c;severity&#x0201d; of diarrhea you are discussing please?</p><p>Au: Thank you for your concern. We classify diarrhea as fecal scores 2 and 3. However, when the fecal score 3 is watery, the animal losses more electrolytes and water, and it was considered to be severe. We added the explanation from the material and methods to the results and discussion (L262).</p><p>Line 255: &#x0201c;Final respiratory score considered the sum of all punctuations&#x0201d; should be reworded to &#x0201c;A final respiratory score was determined by the summation of all scores&#x0201d;. However could you clarify if diarrhea score was included in this or not? Maybe list which scores when into the final sum?</p><p>Au: Thank you for your contribution. We clarified that the respiratory score is calculated by the sum of temperature, cough, nose, eye, and ear scores, and the fecal score does not enter the final sum (L273-274).</p><p>Line 257: What antibiotic was used, what dosage, how long?</p><p>Au: Thank you for your contribution. We added the type and dosage of the antibiotic. Since it was a long-lasting drug, it was used only one dosage (L275-276),</p><p>Line 258 and 261: &#x0201c;subsequently&#x0201d; should be sequential</p><p>Au: Edited, thank you (L277).</p><p>Line 260: What is &#x02018;pulmonary commitment&#x02019;?</p><p>Au: Thank you for your concern. When an animal developed respiratory signs such as nose and eye discharge, cough, and fever, we would do pulmonary auscultation to check if we could find some shortness of breath, edema, and crepitation. Does were sighs of pulmonary commitment. We added that explanation to the text (L280).</p><p>Line 263: Consider moving this section to earlier in materials and methods section and discuss more about why it was used. Was this used to determine dosage?</p><p>Au: Thank you for your contribution. We perform the minimum inhibitory concentration to understand how the essential oils were acting on the changes of the fecal and respiratory scores, as well as the blood cells. However, this assay and results of it did not influence the given dosage. The idea of doing it came after the trial with the calves was already finished (L283).</p><p>Line 267: No footnote number after author reference; inconsistent with remainder of manuscript and instructions to authors</p><p>Au: Edited, thank you (287). </p><p>Line 269: is the tween from a specific company?</p><p>Au: Added, thank you. It was from Sigma-Aldrich in Brazil (L289-290).</p><p>Line 290: Weren&#x02019;t all the animals of similar genetic composition? Why was this used as a blocking effect?</p><p>Au: Thank you for your contribution. Gyr x Holstein is a typical cross dairy breed in Brazil. However, although the animals can have a similar genetic composition is still a very new breed with some variation among animals. For that reason, to have a more precise evaluation, we decided to block the genetic composition (L310).</p><p>Line 294-295: Rephrase &#x0201c;accept or deny&#x0201d;</p><p>Au: Edited, thank you (315). </p><p>Line 297-298: were mean values that were transformed presented as back transformed values? SE would generally not be presented with transformed values. It would be a confidence interval </p><p>Au: Thank you for or concern. We decided to add the CI at the bottom of the table for the transformed value (L352).</p><p>Results and discussion</p><p>Line 307: Remove &#x02018;s&#x02019; from &#x02018;first&#x02019;.</p><p>Au: Edited, thank you (L327).</p><p>First paragraph or in R and D: what about timing of major enteric or other diseases that calves experience and timing of occurrence? Thinking about diarrhea in calves occurring mainly in first 3 wk of life and limited starter intake during this time which would support inclusion in milk if to benefit this situation. What about timing and main use of antibiotics relative to these health events? That is a main motivation for use of essential oils correct?</p><p>Au: Thank you for your concern. We added the timing of diarrhea occurrence. Farms usually use antibiotics to treat diarrhea, even if they do not know the cause. The primary motivation for the use of essential oils is to decrease disease morbidity and the use of antibiotics. Both disease, and antibiotics, can cause disorders on the gut microbiota and, consequently, to the animal itself. (L 327-328, and 332)</p><p>Line 311-312: how was this determined? Not described</p><p>Au: Thank you for your concern. We evaluated if the animals would refuse the milk replacer supplemented with the essential oils. We added this explanation to the material and methods (L156-163).</p><p>Line 316: Total mixed ration instead of total mixed ratio</p><p>Au: Edited, thank you (L341).</p><p>Line 319: consider changing &#x02018;supply&#x02019; to &#x02018;delivery method&#x02019; to be more clear</p><p>Au: Edited, thank you (L337).</p><p>Line 332-333: there is no description of a correlation in stats section. Please include in Stats section</p><p>Au: Included, thank you (L320-322).</p><p>Line 333: spelling error; &#x02018;reveled&#x02019; should be &#x02018;revealed&#x02019;</p><p>Au: Edited, thank you (L359).</p><p>334-335: impacted on smaller should be resulted in reduced</p><p>Au: Edited, thank you (L361).</p><p>Line 344: EO was not defined previously and this sentence was already stated in the second paragraph of this section.

Thank you (L402)</p><p>Table 3: your SEM seem like it would result in a difference between treatments for BW at weaning and final BW are you underpowered to be able to detect these differences?</p><p>Au: Thank you for your concern. The test was not underpowered. We run a power test to verify if it was underpowered using pwr package and we had the following results:</p><p>For weaning body weight:</p><p>pwr.t.test(d = (66.66- 64.66)/1.07, power = .9, sig.level = .05, type = "two.sample", alternative ="two.sided")</p><p>Two-sample t test power calculation</p><p>n = 7.128182</p><p>d = 1.869159</p><p>sig.level = 0.05</p><p>power = 0.9</p><p>alternative = two.sided</p><p>NOTE: n is number in *each* group</p><p>For final body weight:</p><p>pwr.t.test(d=(89.88-93.34)/1.57, power = .9, sig.level = .05, type = "two.sample", alternative = "two.sided")</p><p>Two-sample t test power calculation</p><p>n = 5.491875</p><p>d = 2.203822</p><p>sig.level = 0.05</p><p>power = 0.9</p><p>alternative = two.sided</p><p>NOTE: n is number in *each* group</p><p>We also calculated the confidence interval:</p><p>Item Treatment SEM P &#x02013; value</p><p> CON</p><p>(n = 15) BEO</p><p>(n = 14) T</p><p> Birth BW (kg) 32.40 (28.26 - 35.68) 31.97 (28.88 - 35.91) 0.59 0.85</p><p> Weaning BW (kg) 63.82 (57.51 - 70.14) 67.03 (60.35 -73.70) 1.07 0.45</p><p> Final BW (kg) 89.88 (80.60 - 99.14) 93.34 (83.54 - 103.13) 1.57 0.57</p><p>ADG should be kg/d and feed efficiency should be kg/kg</p><p>Au: Thank you.

We reformulate the sentence to make clear the statement. What we suggest is that the heifers from BEO group could have a higher intake of starter in the morning when it was available, and that could lower the ruminal pH. Since we would evaluate intake just after 24 hours, we did not know how that intake was distributed throughout the day. So, it was evaluated the amount of intake and not intake behavior. For intake behavior, we mean when and how much at a time the heifer would eat (L418 &#x02013; 423).</p><p>Line 379: spaces between numbered citations</p><p>Au. Edited.

There is a little bit of information on this or theories at least.</p><p>Au: Thank you for your contribution.

We apologize for the misunderstanding. We reformulated the sentence. We did not evaluate the direct correlation of the enteric cases and respiratory cases. So, you are right that we cannot make this assumption. However, since both diseases are multifactorial and have an association already cited in the literature, we suppose that there is a correlation. (L599-603).</p><p>Line 571: spelling error: &#x02018;trough&#x02019; should be &#x02018;through&#x02019;</p><p>Au. Edited.

(2008), the name &#x0201c;essential oil&#x0201d; comes from &#x0201c;essence,&#x0201d; related to the property that these substances of providing flavor and odors, and &#x0201c;oil&#x0201d; since they are mostly arranged with low-density lipid composts. However, they are not true oils since they are not made of fatty acids. The essential oils are blends of plant&#x02019;s secondary chemical complex, characterized as a volatile aromatic compound, with 20 to 60 different chemical substances.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="pone.0231068.r003" article-type="aggregated-review-documents"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0231068.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Loor</surname><given-names>Juan J</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2021 Juan J Loor</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2021</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Juan J Loor</copyright-holder><license xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article id="rel-obj003" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0231068" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>

The statement that 90% of dairy farms provide AGPs for disease prevention (Line 86) is not correct, for several reasons. First, the publication from which you reference this percentage uses data collected from the mid to late 2000s, and was published prior to the USDA&#x02019;s Veterinary Feed Directive in 2015. Under the VFD, use of AGPs is no longer permitted on US dairy farms without Veterinary supervision (nor in most other countries). Second, according to the literature referenced, this number refers to the percentage of dairy farms in the US that administer antibiotics at dry-off to prevent intramammary infection during the dry period- which is not the same as an AGP. I also caution you about your reference to 80% of all antibiotics used in the country are from livestock production (Line 84); this number was calculated by &#x02018;public health advocacy groups&#x02019; and is cautioned against in the publication by the FDA. Many glaring inconsistencies exist in data attempting to find the source of antibiotic overuse, and the reality is that judicious use of antimicrobials needs to happen across all health sectors, not just one. Also not recommended to use the word &#x0201c;abuse&#x0201d; (Line 88); suggest &#x02018;overuse&#x02019; instead.</p><p>Suggest revising and truncating this paragraph to focus on the motivation to find alternatives to antibiotic use due to growing concerns of resistance and ineffectiveness, and structure it more to lead into the exploration of phytogenic agents as alternatives.</p><p>Line 92: extra space between &#x0201c;first line&#x0201d;</p><p>Line 95:- Deleted &#x0201c;The&#x0201d; at the beginning of the sentence</p><p>Line 100: &#x0201c;change&#x0201d; should be &#x0201c;by changing&#x0201d;</p><p>Line 101-102: reference for this statement?</p><p>Line 103-104: &#x0201c;Improving&#x0201d; should be &#x0201c;improve&#x0201d;; &#x0201c;decreasing&#x0201d; should be &#x0201c;decrease&#x0201d;.</p><p>Line 105: Change &#x0201c;focus&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;focusing&#x0201d;.

It seems like your objective is to determine a treatment by time interaction of your variables in response to BEO which can be described for both MR intake and fecal scores already without a further correlation between the two. As a reader I think I would be ok with you stating that MR intake was lower during certain weeks (if significant) and also fecal scores were elevated during those same weeks which are likely related because intake decreases when animals are sick.</p><p>Line 367- according to table 3 feed efficiency in the preweaning period tended to be lower in calves supplemented with BEO but no difference postweaning.

The suggestion makes the statement clearer. Edited (L. 344-346).</p><p>Line 331: suggest deleting &#x0201c;it was decided to offer&#x0201d; and add &#x0201c;was offered&#x0201d; after BEO</p><p>Au: Edited.

By young animals, we mean juvenile animals, and old animals, we mean adults (L. 307).</p><p>Line 344: I think you need to end this paragraph by restating that in this study palatability was not a problem with the mixture used.</p><p>Au: Thank you for your concern. We added a sentence at the end of the paragraph to emphasize the response as you suggested (L. 359-360).</p><p>Line 348 and 394- Don&#x02019;t need n= 29 because of number below in table.</p><p>Au: Edited. Thank you (L. 364 and 409).</p><p>Table 2- for MR intake in because of how you analyzed and presented the CI I don&#x02019;t think SEM should be included in the table.</p><p>Au: Edited. Thank you. We removed the SEM (L. 365).</p><p>Line 358- Suggest &#x0201c;An observed effect between fecal scores&#x02026;&#x0201d; Although I am not sure this correlation really adds to your point. It seems like your objective is to determine a treatment by time interaction of your variables in response to BEO which can be described for both MR intake and fecal scores already without a further correlation between the two. As a reader I think I would be ok with you stating that MR intake was lower during certain weeks (if significant) and also fecal scores were elevated during those same weeks which are likely related because intake decreases when animals are sick.</p><p>Au: Thank you for your concern. Besides, it is well known that intakes decrease with sickness, we did the correlation just to statistically prove that the association between intake and the fecal score was negative (L. 373 and 375).</p><p>Line 367- according to table 3 feed efficiency in the preweaning period tended to be lower in calves supplemented with BEO but no difference postweaning. On Line 375 you make about postweaning feed efficiency carry over effects but there does not appear to be any carryover effects in terms of intake or feed efficiency in your experiment. It is unclear what connections and conclusions you are trying to make here.</p><p>Au: Thank you for your concern. The statement on line 375 referend to carry-over effects in other studies and not on this one. However, we reformulate the sentence to be clear. (L. 391-394).</p><p>Line 380: Correct spelling of &#x0201c;monensin&#x0201d;</p><p>Au: Edited.

Thank you.</p><p>Line 403-406: Your comment about structural growth being related to protein in the diet in starter- how does this relate to protein provided (MR and starter) and consumed by your calves related to their expected requirements or growth. By bringing in this information are you saying your calves had already met their requirements for optimal growth or that they were limited on protein so you might not expect a response?</p><p>Au: Thank you for your concern. We formulated the diet and increased the solids in the milk replacer to meet the requirement to our calves for optimal growth. However, we did not test different protein levels in the starter or in the milk replacer to see their interaction with the essential oil supplementation. We added a statement to the manuscript to clarify this point (L.424-426). </p><p>Line 410: &#x0201c;developed&#x0201d; instead of &#x0201c;develop&#x0201d; </p><p>Au: Edited. Thank you (L. 429).</p><p>Line 417: Wrong P-value listed in text; this is the pre-weaning week effect P-value. Your actual P-value for this variable was only a tendency so make sure you adjust your wording and conclusions related to this appropriately.</p><p>Au: Thank you for your concern. We corrected the p-value on the text. We considered statistically different when P &#x02264; 0.05, and we did not work with tendencies (L. 437).</p><p>422-424- it is unclear what this sentence contributes</p><p>Au: Thank you for your concern. The sentence was relocated to a different place to contribute with the result discussion (L. 429).</p><p>Table 4- The C2:C3 ratios presented in the table seem high based on the Acetic and Propionic values presented for example preweaning C2 was 30.8 and C3 was 18.88 which is a ratio of 1.63 not 1.97.

We out the statement just to justify why our animals had low pH when compared to adult animals and that this low ruminal pH did not create any health problem.</p><p>Line 44--: how are essential oils enhanced by low pH?</p><p>Au. Thank you for your question. Some studies reported the there is a higher level of bioactivity at acidic pH. So, at low pH the essential oils behave in a more hydrophobic way and enter more easily inside the cells. This explains how the antimicrobial activity of the essential oils is enhanced at low pH.</p><p>Line 446- your results don&#x02019;t support decreased ruminal nitrogen ammonia or increases in propionate and butyrate</p><p>Au: Thank you for your concern. Indeed, there were no statistical differences in ruminal ammonia or the individual VFA values. However, there was a statistical difference within the proportion between the VFA. Therefore, we believe that besides no statistical difference in the VFA alone, it could be a biological difference that could lead to the difference in the proportions.</p><p>Line 456 to 457- it is not clear the values that you are presenting in this statement or how they relate to what you did. Are these values form a different experiment? What does the P-value relate to? If it is a different study you shouldn&#x02019;t report the actual P-value. Need more context.</p><p>Au.

(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#x000a0;The authors have made effort to improve their manuscript. This is an interesting topic that warrants investigation. However, there are still several areas throughout where revisions are required. I think care should be taken when comparing different essential oils as the mechanism of action can be quite different.</p><p>No description of weaning strategy.</p><p>Figures are not included in latest submission so would not be able to see if they corrected spelling in Figure 2 of the axis for &#x0201c;Linphocytes&#x0201d;</p><p>No explanation was explained for the incomplete data from a calf (8424) in the raw data.</p><p>Randomized block design was stated but in the experimental model. Only genetic composition of the animal was ultimately used as a blocking effect while it was stated that genetics, birth month, birth BW, and % Brix were all used to balance treatments.</p><p>When data has been transformed the P-values should be presented should relate to the transformed analysis, the means should be back transformed, and a confidence interval should be presented instead of the SEM to aid in interpretation of the data presented. This was not provided for milk replacer intake.</p><p>I have an issue with the discussion of palatability in the discussion section.

</p><p>Reviewer #1: The authors have made effort to improve their manuscript. This is an interesting topic that warrants investigation. However, there are still several areas throughout where revisions are required. I think care should be taken when comparing different essential oils as the mechanism of action can be quite different.</p><p>No description of weaning strategy.</p><p>Au: Thank you for your concern. The weaning was performed abruptly because it is the management used on the farm. We added this statement to the text (L.191).</p><p>Figures are not included in latest submission so would not be able to see if they corrected spelling in Figure 2 of the axis for &#x0201c;Linphocytes&#x0201d;</p><p>Au: Thank you. We already corrected the figures and the spelling. We checked in the submission system and the figures were there. We will check with the editors if there is an error to understand why they were not available to you. We submit them again in this new version. </p><p>No explanation was explained for the incomplete data from a calf (8424) in the raw data.</p><p>Au: Thank you for your concern. We are terribly sorry for the misunderstand. During the experiment, the data was saved in different excel spread sheets. To turn it available we united all in just one sheet. During that process, 8424 information after day 74 was not added and we did not see it. We revised all data and add the missing information.</p><p>Randomized block design was stated but in the experimental model. Only genetic composition of the animal was ultimately used as a blocking effect while it was stated that genetics, birth month, birth BW, and % Brix were all used to balance treatments.</p><p>Au: Thank you for your concern. We acknowledge that there was a mistake in the way that this statement was written, thus we rewrote to make it clearer. We used only genetic composition as a blocking effect. The animals were randomly assigned to the treatments. Birth month, birth BW and % Brix were assessed only to check if the groups were balanced. (L. 30- 32; 322-325).</p><p>When data has been transformed the P-values should be presented should relate to the transformed analysis, the means should be back transformed, and a confidence interval should be presented instead of the SEM to aid in interpretation of the data presented. This was not provided for milk replacer intake.</p><p>Au: Thank you for your concern. The confidence interval for that outcome was added at the bottom of the table. However, since it was not noticeably clear and easy to visualize, we added to the table (L. 177).</p><p>I have an issue with the discussion of palatability in the discussion section. I do not believe that this was a true test of the palatability of the additive because it was dosed in a small portion of the milk replacer diet and calves were not given the rest of their milk replacer allotment until the initial dose had been consumed. While palatability is an important question to ask I think the authors make too bold of conclusions based on this experiment and do not address the limitations of how this was conducted and evaluated. </p><p>Au: Thank you for your concern. This is a good perspective and we also think is important to point the limitations of our study. We choose the wrong word to express what we wanted to say. Therefore, we added the study limitations and change the word palatability for ingestibility (L.359-364).</p><p>Discussion about acidosis and low pH is not related to the objectives and do not add to the understanding of how the BEO additive impacted the animal in this experiment (line 451-457)</p><p>Au: Thank you for your concern. We agree that this statement does not add any information and is not related with the objectives of the paper. Therefore, we decided to exclude the entire paragraph.</p><p>The discussion on impact on the rumen is contradictory because at times the authors make the point that it the treatment additive was fed in the milk replacer and should bypass the rumen but go on to make major conclusions based on observed significance related to rumen fermentation changes.</p><p>Au: Thank you for your concern. We make different points about what could have happened. The essential oils were fed in the milk replacer. If they were fed in the starter, changes in the rumen would be obvious and easy to explain. However, since they were fed in the milk replacer, they should bypasss the rumen to the abomasum and intestines. Therefore, one theory would be that the esophageal groove was still one and the oils could have entered the rumen. Other theory it about the potential connections between the intestinal tract. Those are all hypothesis. And to make a clearer statement we have changed the paragraph (L. 473 - 484).</p><p>Line 81- &#x0201c;promoters (AGP) have been&#x0201d;</p><p>Au: Edited. Thank you (L.81).</p><p>Line 85- &#x0201c;The overuse of antimicrobial&#x02019;s concern&#x0201d;</p><p>Au: Edited. Thank you (L.85).</p><p>Line 87- Insert &#x0201c;use of&#x0201d; before &#x0201c;AGP&#x0201d;</p><p>Au: Edited. Thank you (L.86-87).</p><p>Line 91- delete &#x0201c;;&#x0201d; and insert &#x0201c;and&#x0201d;</p><p>Au: Edited. Thank you (L.91).</p><p>Line 95- insert &#x0201c;the acceptability&#x0201d; before AGP&#x02019;s</p><p>Au: Added. Thank you (L.95).</p><p>Line 100- replace &#x0201c;revel&#x0201d; with &#x0201c;appear&#x0201d;</p><p>Au: Edited. Thank you (L.100).</p><p>Line 110- &#x0201c;changing&#x0201d; should be &#x0201c;change&#x0201d;</p><p>Au: Edited. Thank you (L.109).</p><p>Line 118- delete &#x0201c;on&#x0201d;</p><p>Au: Deleted. Thank you (L.118).</p><p>Line 177- Add &#x0201c;&#x000b1; SD&#x0201d; after DM basis</p><p>Au: Added. Thank you (L.177).</p><p>Line 267- &#x0201c;was&#x0201d; should be &#x0201c;were&#x0201d;</p><p>Au: Edited. Thank you (L.267).</p><p>Line 291- &#x0201c;two consecutive days&#x0201d;</p><p>Au: Edited. Thank you (L.291).</p><p>Line 304- &#x0201c;mL&#x0201d;</p><p>Au: Edited. Thank you (L.304).</p><p>Line 344-345- delete &#x0201c;especially during the first month of life when the starter intake is low,&#x0201d;</p><p>Au: Deleted. Thank you.</p><p>Question related to palatability- The feeding of BEO in this study was done in a small portion of the milk replacer each day and the full feeding was not given until after that had been consumed? When trying to interpret effects of BEO addition on palatability I would be cautious or maybe incorporate this point into the discussion.</p><p>Au: Thank you for your concern. The rest of the meal was only given after the calf consumed all the MR containing the additive. Although we did not see any visual difference in the time of MR intake, we agree that we could not say that the calves did not have any palatability issue with the additive since this outcome was not tested. We changed our statement in the discussion section (L. 359 -364).</p><p>Line 359- Suggest &#x0201c;cinnamon as part of the mixture in our study&#x0201d;</p><p>Au: Thank you for your suggestion. We changed the statements in this section to make a clearer point of view and that sentence was deleted.</p><p>Table 2- if Confidence intervals were used those should be reported in the table.</p><p>Au: We added the confidence intervals to the table. Thank you for your suggestion (L.366) </p><p>Line 442- insert &#x0201c;once&#x0201d; before every</p><p>Au: Added. Thank you (L.443).</p><p>Line 472 to 474- this sentence is confusing because I think you are saying the essential oil supplemented calves would have a lower C2:C3 ratio (1.56 and 1.47) compared to the control groups (2.02 and 1.77) but the order of how it is currently written is the opposite.</p><p>Au: Edited. Thank you.
