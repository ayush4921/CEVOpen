<p>One of the chief problems with large-scale essential oilsâ€™ production is the relatively small yield per unit mass of raw materials that seemingly result in the generally high prices that the oils fetch on the international market [

Adulteration could feasibly increase toxicity, mainly in the area of skin reactions. The co-presence of both adulterants and contaminants is also a matter of concern [
