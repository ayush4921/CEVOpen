<p>Due to the interaction between the compounds of the EO and the constituents of food, the antimicrobial efficacy of these substances is reduced when they are used in food products, so a higher concentration of essential oil is necessary to achieve results similar to those obtained in vitro [

 <xref rid="B63-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], with bacteria that affect the oral cavity, it was observed that thymol produces a perforation in the plasma membrane of the bacterial cell, which causes a rapid outflow of intracellular constituents. This compound induces a decrease in intracellular ATP as a direct consequence of infiltration, and, in some bacteria, it also inhibits the synthesis pathways of this biomolecule. The effects of thymol on the potential of membranes are probably the result of the infiltration of substances caused by this compound. Evans and Mart√≠n [
