<p>Essential oils that are rich in phenolic compounds appear to be the most effective compounds against infections caused by microorganisms. As reported above, thyme essential oil is a “natural” preservative with the ability to control microorganisms [
 <xref rid="B59-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. It has been proven that there is a synergistic effect between different compounds of the EO, as occurs, for example, between carvacrol and its precursor p-cymene [
