<p>On the other hand, carvacrol and thymol are isomeric phenolic compounds that can act against the pathogen

 <xref rid="B67-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Carvacrol shows a marked hydrophobic character, so it accumulates in the plasma membrane of the bacterial cell, which, as with thymol, affects its integrity and causes a fall in the membrane potential. In their study, Ultee et al. [
 <xref rid="B67-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] reported that carvacrol acted to reduce the pH across the plasma membrane, acting as a proton exchanger. This compound, which has a hydroxyl radical in the ortho position (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00961-f002">Figure 2</xref>), diffuses through the membrane into the cytoplasm of the cell, where it releases its proton. Subsequently, it returns to the cellular membrane to carry a potassium ion from the cytoplasm. The cation is released, and carvacrol captures a new proton, repeating the cycle. The result is the depletion of ATP deposits in the cell, which leads to a deterioration of vital processes and ultimately to the death of the bacteria. Therefore, thymol (with the hydroxyl radical located in the meta position) and carvacrol have strong antibacterial activity. However, ρ-cimeno, the biological precursor of these two constituents in the essential oil of thyme, lacks a hydroxyl group and shows less activity, which suggests that this radical is related to toxicity against microorganisms. This work also showed a synergistic effect between carvacrol and ρ-cimeno, which may be due to the fact that this precursor contributes to the destabilization of the bacterial plasma membrane, which favors the entry of carvacrol into the cell.
