<p>Thymol and carvacrol are also active against bacteria such as

 <italic>S. aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B68-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. These components show an additive effect that causes the inhibition of the growth of these microorganisms by damaging the integrity of the plasma membrane, affecting the pH and the balance of inorganic ions. Di Pascua et al. [
 <xref rid="B69-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] investigated the bactericidal and bacteriostatic activity of essential oils obtained from various plants on bacteria such as 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>S. typhimurium</italic>, 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> and lactic acid bacteria, and thyme oil was found to be the most effective spice against the greatest number of microorganisms tested. Di Pascua et al. [
 <xref rid="B69-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] showed the lipophilic nature of thymol and carvacrol, as well as other constituents that can be found in thyme oil, such as limonene or eugenol, and reported that these molecules interact with bacterial membranes, altering their structure and making them more permeable.
