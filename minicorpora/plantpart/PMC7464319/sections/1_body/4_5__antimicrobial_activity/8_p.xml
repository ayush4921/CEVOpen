<p>Investigating the activity of various antimicrobial agents obtained from plants, Dorman and Deans [
 <xref rid="B73-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] determined that the EO of thyme has a greater spectrum of action, and, by studying these components separately, these authors confirmed the greater effectiveness of the phenolic compounds present in these oils, especially thymol and carvacrol, with ρ-cimeno being the least active constituent. This test also shows the influence of the hydroxyl group in the phenolic structure since a great difference can be seen between the antibacterial activity of carvacrol and that of its methyl ester, which is a relatively inefficient component; the authors also noted the importance of the position of this group in the benzene ring, contrary to what was previously reflected in this section. They agreed, however, with what was stated by Domingo and López-Brea [
 <xref rid="B74-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], who affirmed that the presence of hydroxyl groups in phenolics is related to the toxicity of these compounds, and the position of these radicals influences the effectiveness of phenols against bacteria.
