In 1999 alone, the global business of selling natural supplements exceeded 15 trillion dollars, of which $7 trillion was in Europe and $3 billion was in North America; and every year, the sales increase. Plant extracts are included in the group of additives classified as “aromatic and flavoring substances”, which include “all natural products and corresponding synthetic products”, and can be consumed by all animal species without any restriction on the dose of product. Since these products are highly acceptable to the consumer, they are one of the future potential alternatives to synthetic preservatives, and the search for new substances represents an important area of research in the field of food additives. All this has led to the use of natural preservative substances, either directly added to food commodities or incorporated into the diet of the supply species.
