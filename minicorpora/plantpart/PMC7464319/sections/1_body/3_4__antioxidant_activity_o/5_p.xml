<p>In a comparison of the antioxidant activity between thyme and other antioxidant compounds, thyme was reported to be one of the best antioxidants. Focusing first on the mechanism of the antioxidant activity of thyme, Lee and Shibamoto [
 <xref rid="B44-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] conducted a study on the antioxidant activity of volatile components from several plants, including thyme, which produced better results, with an inhibitory effect similar to that of α-tocopherol or BHT (butylhydroxytoluene). In addition, Schwarz and Ernst [
 <xref rid="B45-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] published an interesting study in which the antioxidant compounds present in different species of thyme were analyzed, among which was 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic>. These authors identified a new component, p-cimen-2,3-diol, isolated for the first time from thyme leaves, which showed higher antioxidant activity than that of α-tocopherol and BHA (butylhydroxyanisole). Moreover, Youdim et al. [
 <xref rid="B46-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] carried out a study on the antioxidant properties of the essential oil of 
 <italic>Thymus zygis</italic> and its major components, confirming that the effectiveness of these substances increased in the following order:
