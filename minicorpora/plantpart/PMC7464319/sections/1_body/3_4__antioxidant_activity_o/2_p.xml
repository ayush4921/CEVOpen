<p>In general, the inhibitory capacity of oxidation presented by thyme extracts is fundamentally due to its richness in phenolic compounds [
 <xref rid="B11-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The antioxidant activity of these compounds has been evidenced by various authors and is related to their ability to act as scavengers of free radicals, metal ion chelators and inhibitors of oxidative enzymes [

 <xref rid="B36-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, the antioxidant activity of polyphenolic compounds is dependent on the method used for their extraction. A large number of fractionation and distillation techniques using organic solvents are reported in the literature [

 <xref rid="B38-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] concluded that the effectiveness of the extract depends on the solvent used in distillation. For this reason, methanol has been the most commonly used solvent for obtaining commercial extracts [

Initially, alterations in flavor derived from the addition of spices and plants (oregano, thyme, marjoram, rosemary, green tea, sage, etc.) to foods considerably limited their use as antioxidant additives. However, as a solution to this problem, it is possible to introduce a series of stages of deodorization into the process. Currently, the optimization of extraction, purification and fractionation methods has allowed the production of a wide range of extracts that have refined standardized activity and are flavor-free. According to the body of literature, many researchers advise the use of plant extracts because they are effective, economical and considered to be GRAS.
