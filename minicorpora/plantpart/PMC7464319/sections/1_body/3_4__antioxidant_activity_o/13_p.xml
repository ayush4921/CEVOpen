<p>Using in vivo methods, it has been proven, for example, that supplementing the diet of rats with thyme essential oil (
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic>) helps these animals retain a favorable antioxidant capacity throughout their lives [

However, when administered alone, this phenolic compound does not have a significantly greater effect, which seems to indicate that there are other components in the essential oil that also contribute to its antioxidant activity, a fact that was confirmed by subsequent work, such as the study by Youdim et al. [
