<p>Phenolic constituents appear to be primarily responsible for the antioxidant properties of these substances. However, Dorman et al. [
 <xref rid="B39-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] established that there is not a direct relation between the antioxidant effectiveness of an extract and its total phenolic compound content. However, Soares et al. [
 <xref rid="B40-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] evaluated the effectiveness of antioxidants from concentrates obtained from 
 <italic>Thymus zygis</italic> and determined that there is an apparent relationship between the antioxidant potential of these extracts and the total phenols that they contain. One of the sources of the antioxidant properties of the phenols in thyme is their ability to exhibit redox properties and neutralize free radicals [
