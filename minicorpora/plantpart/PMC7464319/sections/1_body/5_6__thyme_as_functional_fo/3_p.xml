<p>Although there is not only one definition of functional food, the following definition: “Natural or processed foods that contain known or unknown biologically-active compounds; which, in defined, effective non-toxic amounts, provide a clinically proven and documented health benefit for the prevention, management, or treatment of chronic disease”. Therefore, thyme can be considered a functional food due to the provided benefits other than basic nutrition. Herbs and spices have been used for their health properties and preservative properties in various cultures, such as in traditional Indian or Mediterranean cuisine (with the combination of herbs, spices and other foods). These kinds of diets are related to lower incidence rates of chronic diseases, including certain forms of cardiovascular disease and cancer, and these effects are due to the synergistic and the additive effects of the complex mixture of the bioactive compounds contained in fruits, vegetables, spices and herbs. Western societies tend to focus on a single food instead of whole dishes. A diet rich in spices not only enhances the taste of food but also makes it healthier.</p>
