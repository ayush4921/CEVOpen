<p>In general, phenolic compounds have an influence on cardiovascular disease because they reduce molecular damage, prevent plaque formation and inhibit the oxidation of cholesterol. Several researchers have also reported the beneficial health effects of thyme on cardiovascular disease. Kensara et al. [

 <italic>Thyme vulgaris</italic> at 100 mg/kg/day for 8 weeks significantly reduced blood pressure in rats, which exhibited improvements in hypertension and aortic vascular damage. Moreover, Haque et al. [

In addition, another study with rabbits that were fed a high-fat diet and administered 3 or 6 mg thymol/kg per day reported the lowering of serum lipids, inhibition of inflammation and oxidative stress and suppression of the progression of atherosclerosis or hyperlipidemia [
