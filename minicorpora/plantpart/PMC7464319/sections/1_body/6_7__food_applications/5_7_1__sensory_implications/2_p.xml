<p>On the one hand, the essential oil can be encapsulated with nanocarriers, such as nanoemulsions, nanofibers, cyclodextrins or amylose [
 <xref rid="B100-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>], which mask flavor and contribute to their controlled release while also protecting against oxidative degradation [
 <xref rid="B101-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. This strategy increases the bioactivity of compounds present in the EO and plant extract; for example, encapsulation increases the stability of volatile components in the EO and increases cellular uptake, improving antimicrobial activity [
