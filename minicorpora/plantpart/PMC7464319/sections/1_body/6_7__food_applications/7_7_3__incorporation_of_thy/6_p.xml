<p>In addition, several examples of the use of thyme in fish have been reported, such as the study of Mahmoud et al. [
 <xref rid="B177-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">177</xref>], who showed that submerging fish fillets (carp) in a 1% thymol/carvacrol solution reduced the initial mesophilic counts, and the shelf life was extended from 4 days to 12 days for fillets stored at 5 °C refrigeration. Similarly, Harpaz et al. [
 <xref rid="B110-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>] observed an increase in the shelf life of perch during its storage for 33 days at 2 °C in comparison with the 12 days of shelf life of the control when the fillets were treated with a mixture of EOs of oregano and thyme at 0.05%. In addition, Ouattara et al. [
 <xref rid="B123-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>] showed that the shelf life of prawns was extended by the use of a combination of thyme oil, γ-irradiation and trans-cinnamaldehyde.
