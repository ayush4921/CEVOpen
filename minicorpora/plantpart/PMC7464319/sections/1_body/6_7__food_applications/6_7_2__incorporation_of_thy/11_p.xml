<p>The mechanism of inhibition of thyme EO has not been studied in great detail [
 <xref rid="B137-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>], but some aspects are clear, such as the fact that their antimicrobial activity is not due to a specific mechanism but that different phenomena occur with several cellular targets [
 <xref rid="B158-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>,
 <xref rid="B165-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>]. Not all of these mechanisms work individually: some of them are the consequence of others [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. An important characteristic of EOs is their hydrophobicity, which allows them to break the lipid chains of the bacterial and mitochondrial cell membrane, disrupting their structures and making them more permeable [
 <xref rid="B166-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>], and after this process, cellular contents and ions leak from the cell [
 <xref rid="B136-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. Therefore, the substantial loss of ions, cell membranes and critical molecules leads to death [
 <xref rid="B167-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>]. In addition, phenolic compounds are able to interact with protein membranes, causing deformation in their structure and interfering with their functionality [
 <xref rid="B167-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>]. Specifically, Davidson [
 <xref rid="B161-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>] reported that carvacrol and thymol are capable of inactivating enzymes that are essential, reacting with cell membranes and altering genetic material.
