 <xref rid="B115-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. In thyme, the synergy between carvacrol and its precursor (ρ-cimeno) is important for its antimicrobial activity [
 <xref rid="B60-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. ρ-Cimeno is introduced to the cell membranes of bacteria to a greater extent than carvacrol, which allows this compound to be transported more easily inside the cell; therefore, a synergistic effect is produced between carvacrol and ρ-cimeno when they are together. Another antimicrobial mechanism of these compounds is that they interfere with the cell membrane (phospholipid bilayer) by increasing its permeability, thereby causing the loss of cellular constituents and inducing energy metabolism problems, impaired nutrient absorption, and electron transport and changes in the synthesis of genetic material [

 <xref rid="B149-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>], who studied the antimicrobial effect of the five major components of thyme EO (thymol, p-cimeno, estragol, carvacrol and linalool) against 
 <italic>S. sonnei</italic> and 
 <italic>S. flexneri</italic>, showed that carvacrol, followed by thymol, demonstrated the greatest antibacterial activity against all microorganisms tested; however, linalool and estragol showed a limited effect.
