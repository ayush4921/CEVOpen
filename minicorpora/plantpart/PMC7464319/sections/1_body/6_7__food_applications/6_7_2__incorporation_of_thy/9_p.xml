<p>As previously stated, thymol and carvacrol have been shown to possess in vitro antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria [

 <xref rid="B68-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Specifically, an in vivo study with thyme EO has shown antimicrobial activity against

 <xref rid="B143-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>] evaluated 50 essential oils of plants to study the antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>A. hydrophila</italic>, 
 <italic>Yersinia enterocolitica</italic> and 
 <italic>Salmonella pullorum</italic>. Among the oils studied, thyme showed strong antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>A. hydrophila</italic>. Thymol reduced yeast growth because it caused damage to metabolic and structural enzymes and inhibited the repair mechanisms of heat damage in yeasts [
