<p>The effect of thymol and carvacrol against 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> has been shown in vitro in several studies [

 <xref rid="B151-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>]. In contrast, some studies have shown no effect or very low antimicrobial activity by the EO of plants against 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> or 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> in minced beef [
 <xref rid="B152-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>] or in prepared chicken meat [
 <xref rid="B153-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>]. The effect of thyme on lactic acid bacterial counts (LACs) was studied by Nieto et al. [
 <xref rid="B126-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>] in three groups of pregnant ewes: one group was fed a basal diet (C), and the diets of the other two groups were modified by replacing 10% (TF1) and 20% (TF2) of the basal diet with pellets composed of 50% barley and 50% distilled thyme leaves. On day 21 of storage of lamb meat in a modified atmosphere, the LAC counts for C were 4.00 (log cfu/g), while for TF1 and TF2, they were 3.30 and 3.41 (log cfu/g), respectively. Therefore, the diet with distilled thyme leaves showed a slight antimicrobial effect by reducing LAC counts at the end of storage. The limited antimicrobial effect of distilled thyme leaves on lactic acid bacteria at days 0, 7 and 14 is attributed to the high tolerance of these bacteria to the antimicrobial properties of EO due to their ability to generate ATP and to survive under osmotic stress conditions [
 <xref rid="B124-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. This behavior was shown by Kykkidou et al. [
 <xref rid="B113-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>], who studied the effect of thyme essential oil on fillets packaged in an MA and stored at 4 °C. For these authors, thyme had no effect on the reduction of the LAC population in fish. Similarly, Tassou et al. [
 <xref rid="B154-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>] observed that the addition of a mixture of lemon juice/olive oil/oregano oil to fillets packaged in an MA decreased the final LAC counts by 0.5 log cfu/g in comparison with control samples. The observed antimicrobial effect of fresh thyme leaf in these studies coincides with the result of numerous studies on the potential of EOs and their compounds as antimicrobials in food. Studies have been carried out on salads, pate, packaged fresh meat, veal, cooked chicken meat, vacuum-packed ham and mozzarella and other cheeses [

 <xref rid="B161-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>]. The inhibitory effect of distilled thyme leaf on microflora, reported in the study of Nieto et al. [
 <xref rid="B126-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>], could be associated with the action of carvacrol and thymol [
 <xref rid="B15-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B159-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>], which, as explained above, enter the circulatory system and are distributed and maintained in animal tissue [
 <xref rid="B162-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>]. Carvacrol, which is usually used as a food additive for its flavoring properties, also shows a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activities against bacteria, yeasts and fungi [
 <xref rid="B163-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>,
 <xref rid="B164-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>]. The antimicrobial activity of the essential oil present in the fresh thyme leaf is due to the fact that its active components contain hydroxyl groups (–OH), a characteristic that makes them highly antimicrobial. The presence of an aromatic structure with a functional polar group has an influence on the inhibitory properties of EOs. Hydroxyl groups can alter the metabolism of enzymes because they bind to their active sites [
