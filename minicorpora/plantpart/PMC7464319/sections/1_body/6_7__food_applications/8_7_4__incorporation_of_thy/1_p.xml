<p>The effects of supplementing animal diets with thyme derivatives and their influence on milk quality were reported by Kraszewski et al. [
 <xref rid="B178-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">178</xref>]. These authors studied the effects of supplementing the diet of cows with a mixture of aromatic plants containing peppermint (
 <italic>Mentha piperita</italic> L.), chamomile (
 <italic>Matricaria chamomilla</italic> L.), nettle (
 <italic>Urtica dioica</italic> L.), yarrow (
 <italic>Achillea millefolium</italic> L.) and thyme (
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> L.), and they achieved positive results in milk yield and the physicochemical and technological composition of milk. In general, the success of the use of antioxidants in the diet of animals has been confirmed by many authors as a tool to improve the quality of products and derivatives, and their benefits for animal health, although the administration of these antioxidants must be controlled in terms of the quantity and the type of antioxidant administered since frequent use of phenolic compounds in the diet of cows can cause abortion or intoxication [
