<p>The generic name comes from the Greek verb Thym, which translates to perfume, in allusion to the intense and pleasant aroma of the plant. It is an aromatic, vivacious, woody, very polymorphic plant that is 10–40 cm high, with numerous branches that are woody, erect, compact, and brownish or velvety-white. The linear, oblong leaves are 3–8 mm, with the petiole or its margins ciliated and whitish on its underside. The flowers are axillary and grouped at the tip of the branches, forming a kind of terminal node. The fruit is a tetraquenium and brown in color. It blooms from March onwards. It is a highly variable species, both in its phenology and in the chemical composition of its essential oil, in which seven chemotypes have already been detected. For this reason, there is often taxonomic confusion in this genus, the varieties or ecotypes of which have been identified as different species. Its habitat is in the countries of the western Mediterranean Basin in dry and sunny soils. It is abundant in the east, center and south of the Iberian Peninsula. It develops in limy, clayey and, less frequently, siliceous soils. It grows at an altitude of 0–1800 m. The climate is warm-temperate and mountainous. It is resistant to frost and drought, but not waterlogging or excess environmental humidity.</p>
