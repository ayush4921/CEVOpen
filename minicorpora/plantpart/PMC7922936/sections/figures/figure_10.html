 <caption> Effects of E. intisy EO (5–50 µg/mL on 0.5 mM verapamil-stimulated P-gp ATPase activity. The data are expressed as luminescence (RLU) and are presented as mean ± SE of three experiments, each in duplicate. Different letters represent significant differences (Tukey’s test) in luminescence among the concentrations ( p &lt; 0.01). </caption>
