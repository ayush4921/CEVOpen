0: However, there are few studies that have investigated their potential anticancer capacities.
1: Euphorbia species occurring in Southern Africa and Madagascar produce a high diversity of diterpenoids possibly because of an adaptive pressure exerted by not yet described herbivores [ 16].
2: Indeed, the southern arid zone of Madagascar is a hotspot for  Euphorbia with more than 170 native species [ 30].
3: Euphorbia is locally classified among the top 5 species-rich genera with medicinal properties [ 31].
4: Euphorbia intisy Drake ( Figure 1) is a tree-like succulent of the dry spiny forests whose exploitation dates to the end of the 19th century, boosted by the strong European demand for latex [ 32].
5: E. intisy provides rubber with high quality latex and low resin contents from trunks and roots [ 33, 34].
6: The latex itself is not toxic, however, the seeds are toxic and cause vomiting, severe bowel disturbance, and heartburn [ 35].
7: E. intisy was nearly made extinct by overexploitation, in the beginning of the 20th century [ 36].
8: It is now classified as Near Threatened according to the IUCN red list [ 37].
9: E. intisy is cultivated in the open ground at the Botanical Garden of Palermo.
10: It is easily propagated by cuttings and therefore enough material for experiments can be obtained with no damages to wild populations, showing to be a good candidate to investigations on its chemical composition and biological activities.
