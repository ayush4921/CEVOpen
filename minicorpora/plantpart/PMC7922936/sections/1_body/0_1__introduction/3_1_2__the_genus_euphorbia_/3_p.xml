<p>However, there are few studies that have investigated their potential anticancer capacities. 
 <italic>Euphorbia</italic> species occurring in Southern Africa and Madagascar produce a high diversity of diterpenoids possibly because of an adaptive pressure exerted by not yet described herbivores [
 <xref rid="B16-pharmaceuticals-14-00111" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Indeed, the southern arid zone of Madagascar is a hotspot for 
 <italic>Euphorbia</italic> with more than 170 native species [
 <xref rid="B30-pharmaceuticals-14-00111" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. 
 <italic>Euphorbia</italic> is locally classified among the top 5 species-rich genera with medicinal properties [
 <xref rid="B31-pharmaceuticals-14-00111" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. 
 <italic>Euphorbia intisy</italic> Drake (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-14-00111-f001">Figure 1</xref>) is a tree-like succulent of the dry spiny forests whose exploitation dates to the end of the 19th century, boosted by the strong European demand for latex [
 <xref rid="B32-pharmaceuticals-14-00111" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. 
 <italic>E. intisy</italic> provides rubber with high quality latex and low resin contents from trunks and roots [
 <xref rid="B33-pharmaceuticals-14-00111" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-pharmaceuticals-14-00111" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The latex itself is not toxic, however, the seeds are toxic and cause vomiting, severe bowel disturbance, and heartburn [
 <xref rid="B35-pharmaceuticals-14-00111" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. 
 <italic>E. intisy</italic> was nearly made extinct by overexploitation, in the beginning of the 20th century [
 <xref rid="B36-pharmaceuticals-14-00111" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. It is now classified as Near Threatened according to the IUCN red list [
 <xref rid="B37-pharmaceuticals-14-00111" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. 
 <italic>E. intisy</italic> is cultivated in the open ground at the Botanical Garden of Palermo. It is easily propagated by cuttings and therefore enough material for experiments can be obtained with no damages to wild populations, showing to be a good candidate to investigations on its chemical composition and biological activities.
