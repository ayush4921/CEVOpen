<p>The multidrug resistant variant HL-60R is characterized by constitutive expression of NF-κB in respect to HL-60 [

 <italic>E. intisy</italic> EO could interfere in the NF-κB DNA binding capacity, HL-60 and HL-60R cell lines were treated with 25 µg/mL of essential oil for 24 h. We observed a strong reduction of NF-κB DNA-binding activity only in HL-60R cells (

 <xref rid="B50-pharmaceuticals-14-00111" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] highlighted that HL-60R cells are characterized by an overexpression of P-gp, Bcl-2 and IAPs. Moreover, the treatment with the essential oil also caused a substantial mRNA and protein decrease of some NF-κB target genes, in particular antiapoptotic factors such as Survivin, XIAP, Bcl-2, and the multidrug efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (

Based on these results, we speculate that the transcriptional changes in P-gp and IAPs are primary effects and that these modifications induce cytotoxicity. These results corroborate the idea that EOs extracted from succulent plants rich in phytol interfere with NF-κB pathway in MDR models.
