<p>The identification of compounds was carried out using the mass spectral libraries in respect to our libraries were considered [
 <xref rid="B38-pharmaceuticals-14-00111" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39-pharmaceuticals-14-00111" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], and NIST11. We only considered compounds which showed mass spectral similarities &gt; 80% in respect to our libraries. Kovats retention indices were calculated using a series of n-alkanes (C10-C30).
