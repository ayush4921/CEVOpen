0: Crude oil (petroleum) hydrocarbons are one of the most common groups of persistent organic pollutants [ 1, 2, 3].
1: Petroleum hydrocarbons are known to be toxic to many living organisms due to their mutagenic and carcinogenic properties [ 4, 5].
2: The low rate of decomposition of oil and oil products in the environment triggers their accumulation and a gradual increase in their concentration in the environmental objects, including the soil.
3: After getting into the soil, crude oil products destroy its structure, upset the airwater balance [ 1], alter the soil physicochemical properties [ 6, 7], inhibit the microbial proliferation [ 1], disrupt the soil enzymatic activity [ 8, 9], and have a negative impact on terrestrial and soil mesofauna [ 6], as well as on plant growth and development [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
