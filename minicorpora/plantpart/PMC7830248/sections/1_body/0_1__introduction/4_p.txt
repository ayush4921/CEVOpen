0: Despite the fact that the antioxidative system and its significance for the adaptation of plants to pollution stresses has been reviewed frequently, little is known about the effects of crude oil stress on the plant antioxidative system.
1: Some studies have shown a change in the contents of proline, non-protein thiols [ 5, 17], ascorbic acid, riboflavin, anthocyanins [ 18], phenolic compounds, and flavonoids [ 19] in plants growing on oil contaminated soils.
2: A number of authors have investigated the effect of oil pollution on the activity of plant antioxidative enzymes [ 9, 12].
3: Taking into consideration the fact that the antioxidative status of plants may directly affect their adaptation to environmental stress, it is necessary to make a detailed study of crude oils effects on the plant antioxidative system.
