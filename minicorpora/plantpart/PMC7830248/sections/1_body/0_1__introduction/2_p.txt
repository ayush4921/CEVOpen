0: The growth and development disorder of plants, growing on oil-contaminated soils, is caused by several reasons.
1: Firstly, the absorption of toxic petroleum molecules by plants can modify the permeability and structure of the plasma membrane [ 6], alter the shape and size of the parenchyma tissue, reduce the intercellular space in the cortex of the stem and roots, and inhibit the mitotic activity of the root meristem [ 10].
2: Secondly, insufficient aeration caused by air displacement from the pore spaces between the soil particles by crude oil leads to root stress and low water availability to the plant [ 11].
3: Moreover, oil pollution minimizes the percentage of organic matter available to plants and reduces the amount of mineral nutrients such as sodium, phosphates, potassium, sulfates, and nitrates [ 8, 9].
