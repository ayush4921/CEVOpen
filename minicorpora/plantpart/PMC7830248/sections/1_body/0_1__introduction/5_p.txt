0: Rye ( Secale cereale L.) is one of the most important cereal crops in Eastern and Northern Europe.
1: Recently, interest in rye production has increased because of its nutritional value and its tolerance to environmental stress factors.
2: Rye proves to be a rich source of phytochemicals such as phenolic acids, flavonoids, anthocyanins, lignans, alkylresorcinols, and benzoxazinoids [ 20, 21].
3: Unlike wheat and triticale, rye is more tolerant to abiotic and biotic stress factors, cold resistant, and able to grow on nutrient-poor sandy soils with a low pH [ 22].
