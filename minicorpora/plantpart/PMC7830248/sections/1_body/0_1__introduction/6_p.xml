<p>Most of the previous studies, which were devoted to the investigation of the oil pollution effect on plant growth and resistance, examined the plants growing in coastal and oilfield areas, and determined their phytoremediation potential [

To the best of our knowledge, the current study will be one of the earliest studies aimed at investigating the effects of different concentrations of crude oil in the soil on growth, oxidative stress, and antioxidative response in rye plants. Moreover, since genotypes within the species are known to vary in their resistance to environmental stress, two rye varieties were chosen for the current study due to their resistance to low temperatures, soil acidity, and increased concentration of aluminum ions [

The results of the current study will contribute to an increased knowledge about (i) the growth and physiological responses of two rye varieties to various levels of oil pollution in the soil, (ii) oxidative stress induced in rye plants in conditions of soil pollution with crude oil, and (iii) the reaction of low molecular weight antioxidants and antioxidative enzymes in two rye varieties growing on the oil-contaminated soil. The findings of the present study will enhance understanding of the mechanism of oil tolerance in cereals and will make it possible to determine a rye variety that tends to be more resistant to oil pollution.
