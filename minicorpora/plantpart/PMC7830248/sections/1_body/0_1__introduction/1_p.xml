 <xref rid="B2-plants-10-00157" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-plants-10-00157" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Petroleum hydrocarbons are known to be toxic to many living organisms due to their mutagenic and carcinogenic properties [
 <xref rid="B4-plants-10-00157" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-plants-10-00157" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The low rate of decomposition of oil and oil products in the environment triggers their accumulation and a gradual increase in their concentration in the environmental objects, including the soil. After getting into the soil, crude oil products destroy its structure, upset the airâ€“water balance [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-10-00157" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], alter the soil physicochemical properties [
 <xref rid="B6-plants-10-00157" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-plants-10-00157" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], inhibit the microbial proliferation [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-10-00157" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], disrupt the soil enzymatic activity [
