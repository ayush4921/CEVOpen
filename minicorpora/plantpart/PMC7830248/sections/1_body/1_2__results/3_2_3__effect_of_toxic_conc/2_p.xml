<p>Malondialdehyde (MDA) accumulation in plants grown on the crude oil-polluted soil also depended on the rye variety (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00157-f002">Figure 2</xref>b). Thus, for the Krona variety, a significant increase in MDA was recorded in plants grown on the soil whose oil concentration was equal to 3% or more. A significant increase in MDA production was observed in Valdai variety plants grown on the soil whose oil concentration was equal to 6% or more. On average, at the maximum oil concentration in the soil (12%), MDA content in plants was approximately 1.6 times higher than in the control.
