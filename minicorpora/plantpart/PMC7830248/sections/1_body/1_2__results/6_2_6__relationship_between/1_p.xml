<p>A Pearson’s correlation analysis was executed between different studied parameters of two rye varieties (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00157-f005">Figure 5</xref>). In both Krona and Valdai varieties, contents of MDA, H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, proline, dehydroascorbic acid, 2,3-diketogulonic acid, and phenolic compounds, as well as activity of SOD positively correlated with the oil concentration in soil (r &gt; 0.5, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The negative correlation was detected between contents of MDA and H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and growth-related parameters, contents of chlorophyll 
 <italic>a</italic>, total chlorophylls, carotenoids. Additionally, in the Krona variety, contents of non-protein thiols, ascorbic acid and activities of CAT and GPX were negatively correlated with parameters of oxidative stress (r = −0.51 to −0.95, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).
