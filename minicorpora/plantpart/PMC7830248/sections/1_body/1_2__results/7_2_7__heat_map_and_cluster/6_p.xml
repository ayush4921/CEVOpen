<p>Distribution of plant samples into clusters primarily depended on the oil concentration in the soil rather than rye variety (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00157-f006">Figure 6</xref>, at the left). The first cluster included control plants of both varieties and Valdai plants at 1.5% oil concentration in the soil. The second cluster included Krona plants at 1.5% and 3% oil concentrations. The third cluster included Valdai plants at 3% and 6% concentrations. The fourth cluster included Krona plants at 6% oil concentration and Valdai plants at 12% oil concentration. A separate cluster was formed by Krona plants grown at 12% oil concentration in the soil. These plants were characterized by minimal or very low parameter values of growth, chlorophylls content, carotenoids content, ascorbic acid content, non-protein thiols content, activities of CAT, APX, POD, and GPX, as well as high values of malondialdehyde content, hydrogen peroxide content, oxidized forms of ascorbic acid (dehydroascorbic and 2,3-diketogulonic acids) content, phenolic compounds content, and superoxide dismutase activity.
