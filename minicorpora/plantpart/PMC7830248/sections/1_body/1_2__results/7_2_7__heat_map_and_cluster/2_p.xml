<p>The first cluster included such parameters as plant height, shoot fresh weight, shoot dry weight, shoot water content, root water content, carotenoid content, non-protein thiols content, and catalase activity. In this cluster, parameter values in control plants were high even at low and medium oil concentrations. At the highest oil concentration (12%), parameter values of this cluster sharply decreased and were minimal.</p>
