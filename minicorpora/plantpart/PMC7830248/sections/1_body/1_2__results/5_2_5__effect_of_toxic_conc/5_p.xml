<p>Peroxidase (POD) activity in rye shoots depended on the oil concentration in the soil and rye variety (

This enzyme activity was lower in the Krona variety than in the control at low oil concentrations in the soil (1.5 and 3%) and at the maximum oil concentration (12%). At 6% oil concentration in the soil, peroxidase activity in shoots of this variety was equitable to the control. A significantly lower peroxidase activity compared to the control was recorded in the Valdai variety at the lowest studied oil concentration in the soil equal to 1.5% and at the highest studied oil concentration equal to 12%. In other variants of the experiment, no significant differences were detected between the control and the plants grown on the crude oil-polluted soil.
