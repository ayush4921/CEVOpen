<p>Changes in ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activity depending on the oil concentration in the soil differed in shoots of different varieties (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00157-f004">Figure 4</xref>c). Thus, ascorbate peroxidase activity in Krona plants grown on the oil-polluted soil was significantly higher than that of the control. Compared to the control, a higher ascorbate peroxidase activity was detected in Valdai plants grown only on the soil having 3% and 6% oil concentrations.
