 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00157-f004">Figure 4</xref>d). A decrease in the activity of this enzyme was observed at higher oil concentrations. GPX activity in Krona variety was 1.6 times lower than in the control at the maximum oil concentration in the soil equal to 12%. GPX activity in Valdai variety did not differ significantly from the control at the maximum oil concentration in the soil.
