<p>Catalase activity in shoots of both varieties also increased at oil concentrations equal to 1.5%, 3%, and 6% in comparison with the control (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00157-f004">Figure 4</xref>b). However, at the maximum oil concentration (12%), a sharp decrease in catalase activity was observed. In this part of the experiment, catalase activity in Krona shoots was minimal, and it was comparable to the control in Valdai shoots.
