<p>Changes in the content of non-protein thiols differed from changes in the content of proline in conditions of soil pollution with crude oil (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00157-f003">Figure 3</xref>b). At low oil concentrations (1.5 and 3%), content of non-protein thiols in the shoots of both varieties decreased in comparison with the control. At 6% oil concentration in the soil, the maximum non-protein thiols content was observed in both varieties while at the maximum oil concentration equal to 12%, non-protein thiols content in shoots was minimal.
