<p>A sharp increase in the content of ascorbate was detected at minor oil concentrations in the soil (1.5 and 3%) in Krona shoots, and at all studied oil concentrations in Valdai shoots in comparison with the control (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00157-f003">Figure 3</xref>c). Contents of dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) and 2,3-diketogulonic acid (DKGA) in rye shoots were about 3 times less than content of ascorbic acid (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00157-f003">Figure 3</xref>d,e). The highest DHA content for both rye varieties was observed at 6% oil concentration in the soil. DKGA content increased with the increase in oil concentration in the soil and was maximal at the maximum pollution level.
