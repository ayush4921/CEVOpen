<p>Valdai variety demonstrated a significant decrease in shoot fresh weight at 12% oil concentration in the soil. In addition, the stimulating effect of low oil concentrations (1.5 and 3.0%) on the biomass of this rye variety was determined. This was most notable when the plant dry weight was analyzed. At the given oil concentrations in the soil, this parameter turned out to be about 1.2 times higher in comparison with the control (without oil introduction). Water content in shoots of both Krona and Valdai rye varieties decreased with an increase in the oil concentration in the soil. However, a significantly lower value of this parameter was recorded only at the maximum oil concentration equal to 12% (
