<p>The root system of the studied rye varieties proved to be even more affected by crude oil contamination. Unlike above-ground plant parts, inhibition of root growth was observed at lower oil concentrations in the soil. This tendency was characteristic of both the Krona and Valdai rye varieties. A significant decrease in both root fresh weight and dry weight compared to the control was recorded at 1.5% oil concentration in the Krona variety. The Valdai variety demonstrated a decrease in root fresh weight at 1.5% oil concentration in the soil and a decrease in root dry weight at 3.0% oil concentration in the soil. An evidential decrease in water content in roots of both rye varieties was recorded only at the maximum oil concentration in the soil equal to 12%.</p>
