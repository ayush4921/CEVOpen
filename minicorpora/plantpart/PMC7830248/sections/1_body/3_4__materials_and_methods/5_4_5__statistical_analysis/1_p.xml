<p>Experimental data were statistically processed using the SigmaPlot 12.3 (Systat Software GmbH, Erkrath, Germany), OriginPro 9 (OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA, USA) and RStudio Software. The tables and graphs show the mean values with the standard deviation (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4). To estimate statistically significant differences between the experimental variants, the two-way analysis of variance (two-way ANOVA) was performed. A one-way analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) was performed for each factor (the oil concentration and the rye variety) separately because the two-factor analysis revealed a significantly influential interaction between the factors (

Pearson correlation was applied to analyze the correlation between the studied parameters and correlation plot was constructed with reference of coefficient correlation values. The heat map and clusters were constructed based on normalized values of studied parameters. The Euclidean distance was used as a similarity measure.
