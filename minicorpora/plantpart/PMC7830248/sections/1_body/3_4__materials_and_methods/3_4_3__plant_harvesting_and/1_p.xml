<p>Plant harvesting for analysis was performed at tillering growth stage (GS 26, main shoot and 6 tillers) according to Zadoks’ scale. After harvesting, shoot fresh weight and root fresh weight from each pot were measured. The plant height and root length were measured for ten randomly selected plants from each pot. One part of the shoots was dried and used to determine water content and shoot dry weight. The whole root biomass was dried at 60 °C for 48 h. Then, root dry weight was measured. For biochemical analysis, fresh shoots were placed in liquid nitrogen within 5–10 min after harvesting and stored at −80 °C.</p>
