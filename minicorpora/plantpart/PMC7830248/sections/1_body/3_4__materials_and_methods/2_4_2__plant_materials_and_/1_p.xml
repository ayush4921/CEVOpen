<p>The pot experiment was conducted in the glass covered greenhouse at Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University (Kaliningrad, Russia, 54°44′ N 20°30′ E), from 16 April to 28 May 2018. The Krona and Valdai varieties of winter rye (
 <italic>Secale cereale</italic> L.) used in the experiment were obtained from the Seed station at the Ministry of Agriculture of the Kaliningrad region. These varieties were chosen for two reasons. Firstly, both varieties are listed in the 
 <italic>State Register for Cultivation in the North-Western Region of Russia</italic> including the Kaliningrad Region located in the Southeastern Baltic coast. The climate of Region is temperate, marine transitional to continental (the July mean temperature ranges from +17 to +18 °C; the January mean temperature is −4 to −2°C; the average annual precipitation is 750 mm). Secondly, it was previously shown that these varieties differ in their resistance to particular abiotic factors (low temperatures, acidification, and high concentration of aluminum ions in the soil). Rye was grown in the culture pots filled with the soil collected from the field located in Bagrationovskiy District (the Kaliningrad Region, Russia, 54°29′ N 20°25′ E). The soil used in the experiment had the following physicochemical properties: soil texture–clay clam, pH-6.7, organic matter–1.76%, total N content–0.23%, available P–17.8 mg kg
 <sup>−1</sup>, available K–212 mg kg
 <sup>−1</sup>. The pot dimensions were 29 cm height and 20 cm radius. Each pot contained 10 kg of soil. Crude oil was introduced into the soil to yield the concentrations of 1.5, 3.0, 6.0, 12.0% (i.e., 15, 30, 60 and 120 g crude oil per 1 kg soil). Crude oil effect on the plants was compared to the control (without oil introduction). Crude oil used in the experiment came from the oilfield located in the Kaliningrad region. Its API (American Petroleum Institute) gravity was 35.2, and its sulfur content was equal to 0.2% (
 <italic>w/w</italic>). Oil used in the experiment consisted of 1.05% asphaltene, 66.7% aliphatic hydrocarbons, 21.7% aromatic hydrocarbons, and 10.54% polar materials. Moreover, the following basic fertilizers were added: 0.17 g of nitrogen in terms of ammonium nitrate, 0.13 g of P
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>5</sub> in terms of potassium hydrophosphate, 0.28 g of K
 <sub>2</sub>O in terms of potassium hydrophosphate and sulfate, and 0.044 of MgO in terms of magnesium sulfate per kg of the soil. Solutions of fertilizers and crude oil were introduced in such a manner that they could not mix with each other. At the start of the experiment, basic elements (phosphorus, potassium, nitrogen, and magnesium) were introduced into the extreme points of the square on the soil surface, whereas crude oil was applied to its central point. After air-drying, the soil was mixed, and rye was planted. There were 20 plants in each pot. During the experiments, each pot was weighed and the plants were watered every 3 days using deionized water to maintain the soil moisture at approximately 70% of the soil’s water-holding capacity. Average air temperature in the greenhouse during the growing period was 18.4 °C and relative humidity was on average 68% (SHT71 temperature and humidity sensor, Sensirion AG, Stäfa, Switzerland), photosynthetic photon flux density was of 350 µmol m
 <sup>−2</sup> s
 <sup>−1</sup> (Li-250A lightmeter, Li-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA) at the plant height. Four replications for each treatment (crude oil introduction and rye varieties) were conducted. There were 40 pots in total. The pots were arranged in a completely randomized design.
