<p>Contents of ascorbic acid, dehydroascorbic acid, and 2,3-diketogulonic acid were measured spectrophotometrically by using the reaction of DHA and DKGA with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine as described in [
 <xref rid="B44-plants-10-00157" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. To find the total content of all acids, AsA was oxidized with 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol reagent (2% solution in 4.5 M sulphuric acid, containing 0.25% of thiourea). In order to determine DHA and DKGA separately, DHA in the plant extract was reduced to AsA with 2·10
 <sup>−3</sup> M unithiol solution prepared in phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). This step made it possible to determine DKGA content. DHA content was calculated as difference between results obtained without the “reduction” step and with it. Finally, ascorbic acid content was calculated as difference between the total contents of the three acids, and the sum of contents of DHA and DKGA. Ascorbic acid solutions of fixed concentration were used to make a calibration curve. Contents of AsA, DHA and DKGA were expressed in μg of per gram dry weight.
