<p>Total phenolics content was determined using Folin–Ciocalteu method as described in [
 <xref rid="B44-plants-10-00157" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Briefly, the plant material (0.1 g) was homogenized in 10 mL of 70% ethanol. The homogenate was centrifuged at 4500× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 30 min. The reaction mixture contained 100 µL of supernatant, 300 µL of Folin–Ciocalteu reagent, and 6 mL of 6.75% solution of sodium carbonate. The mixture was incubated for 30 min in the dark at room temperature. Optical absorbance was measured at 720 nm. Content of total phenolic compounds was determined using a calibration curve with gallic acid as standard and expressed in mg gallic acid equivalents per g dry weight.
