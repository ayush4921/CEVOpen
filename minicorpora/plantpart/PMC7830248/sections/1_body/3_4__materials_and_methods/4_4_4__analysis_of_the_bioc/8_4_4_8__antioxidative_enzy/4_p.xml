<p>Ascorbate peroxidase (APX, EC 1.11.1.11) activity was determined by monitoring the oxidation rate of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-dependent ascorbate as described in [
 <xref rid="B66-plants-10-00157" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The reaction mixture included 80 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 0.6 mM H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mM Na
 <sub>2</sub>EDTA, 0.5 mM ascorbic acid and 50 μL of the plant extract. H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> was added to start the reaction at 25 °C. The decrease in optical absorbance of the mixture was measured at 290 nm every second for 120 s. Enzyme activity was calculated based on extinction coefficient equal to 2.8 mM
