The reaction was started by introducing 20 μL of 0.6 M hydrogen peroxide into the reaction mixture. The control cuvette contained the same reagents, but no hydrogen peroxide was added. Catalase activity was determined by the change in optical absorbance at 240 nm every second for 100 s. Extinction coefficient (ε = 39.4 mM
