<p>Superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1) activity was determined by its ability to inhibit the photochemical reduction of nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) as described in [
 <xref rid="B64-plants-10-00157" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] with some modifications. The reaction mixture contained 63 µM NBT, 13 mM L-methionine, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.05 M sodium carbonate and 0.5 mL enzyme extract (or distilled water in control). The reaction was started by adding 20 μL of 0.025% riboflavin. The tubes were then quickly placed under fluorescent lamps (18 W). The reaction time was 15 min. After the time elapsed, the reaction was stopped by placing the tubes in the dark. Optical absorbance of solutions was determined at 560 nm. The amount of enzyme necessary to inhibit the photoreduction of 50% nitro blue tetrazolium at 25 °C was taken as a unit of SOD activity and was expressed per mg of protein.
