<p>Peroxidase (POD, EC 1.11.1.7) activity was determined spectrophotometrically using guaiacol as a phenolic substrate and hydrogen peroxide [
 <xref rid="B68-plants-10-00157" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. The reaction mixture contained 0.15 mL of 4% guaiacol, 0.15 mL of 1% (

 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, 2.66 mL of 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), and 40 μL of the plant extract. The control sample contained all the reagents but the plant extract. Optical absorbance of the mixture was measured at 470 nm. Enzyme activity was calculated based on extinction coefficient of tetraguaiacol equal to 26.6 mM
