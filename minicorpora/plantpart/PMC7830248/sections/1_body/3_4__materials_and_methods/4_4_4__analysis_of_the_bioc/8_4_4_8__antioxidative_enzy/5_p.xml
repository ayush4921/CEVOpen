<p>Glutathione peroxidase (GPX, EC 1.11.1.9) activity was determined according to [
 <xref rid="B67-plants-10-00157" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] using hydrogen peroxide as a substrate. To perform the enzymatic reaction, 200 μL of the plant extract was placed into the reaction tube containing 400 μL of 0.1 mM solution of reduced glutathione and 200 μL of 0.067 M solution of KNaHPO
 <sub>4</sub>. The mixture containing all the reagents except the plant extract was used as a control. After incubating the mixture in a water bath at 25 °C for 5 min, 0.2 mL of 1.3 mM hydrogen peroxide solution was added to the mixture. The reaction time was 10 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 mL of 1% trichloroacetic acid solution and placing the reaction mixture in an ice bath. Then, the mixture was centrifuged and used to determine glutathione content in it. For determining glutathione content, 0.48 mL of the supernatant was mixed with 2.2 mL of 0.32 M Na
 <sub>2</sub>HPO
 <sub>4</sub> and 0.32 mL of 1.0 mM 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic) acid. The mixture was incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Optical absorbance was measured at 412 nm. Enzyme activity was calculated based on the decrease in content of reduced glutathione.
