<p>Proline content in rye shoots was determined spectrophotometrically using the acid-ninhydrin method as described in [
 <xref rid="B62-plants-10-00157" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] with some modifications. The plant material (0.5 g) was homogenized in 10 mL of 3% sulfosalicylic acid. The homogenate was filtered, and the filtrate was used for further analysis. The filtrate was mixed with 2 mL of ninhydrin reagent (1.25 g of ninhydrin, 30 mL of glacial acetic acid, 20 mL of 6 M H
 <sub>3</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub> solution) and 2 mL of glacial acetic acid. The reaction mixture was incubated for 1 h in a water bath at 100 °C, after which it was rapidly cooled on ice. The mixture was extracted with toluene, and optical absorbance was determined at 520 nm. Standard solutions of L-proline were used to make the calibration graph. Proline content in the plant material was expressed in µmol per gram dry weight.
