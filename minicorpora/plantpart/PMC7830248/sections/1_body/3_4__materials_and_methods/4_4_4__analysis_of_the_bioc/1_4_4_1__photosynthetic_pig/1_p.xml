<p>Accurately weighted 0.5 g plant sample was taken and homogenized in tissue homogenizer (Ultra-Turrax Tube Drive, IKA, Staufen, Germany) with 10 mL of 80% acetone. The homogenized sample mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 Â°C. The supernatant was separated. Then, 0.5 mL of it was mixed with 4.5 mL of the solvent. Optical absorbance of the above mixture was determined at 470 nm, 646.8 nm, and 663.2 nm. Pigments content was calculated according to [

 <italic>a</italic>, chlorophyll 
 <italic>b</italic>, and carotenoids in plant were converted to mg per gram dry weight. The total chlorophyll content was calculated by adding contents of chlorophyll 
 <italic>a</italic> and chlorophyll 
 <italic>b</italic>.
