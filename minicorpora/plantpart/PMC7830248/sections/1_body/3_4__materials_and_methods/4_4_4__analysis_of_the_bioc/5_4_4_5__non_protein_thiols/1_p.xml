<p>Non-protein thiols content was determined using 5,5′-dithiobis- (2-nitrobenzoic acid) as described in [
 <xref rid="B63-plants-10-00157" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The plant material (1 g) was homogenized in 10 mL of 5% sulfosalicylic acid. The homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 20 min. The reaction mixture contained supernatant, 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 0.5 mM EDTA, and 0.25 mM 5,5′-dithiobis- (2-nitrobenzoic acid). The mixture was incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Optical absorbance was measured at 412 nm. Non-protein thiols content was determined using a calibration graph. Glutathione was used as a standard. Non-protein thiols content in plants was expressed in μmoles per g dry weight.
