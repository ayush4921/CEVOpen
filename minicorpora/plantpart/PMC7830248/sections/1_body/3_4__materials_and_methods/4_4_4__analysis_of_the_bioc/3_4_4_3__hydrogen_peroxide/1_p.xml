<p>Hydrogen peroxide content in rye shoots was determined according to [
 <xref rid="B61-plants-10-00157" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The plant material was homogenized in trichloroacetic acid in an ice bath. The homogenate was centrifuged at 16,000Ã— 
 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min. The supernatant was added to the reaction mixture containing 10 mM of phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and 1 M of potassium iodine (KI). The mixture was incubated in the dark for 1 h. Optical absorbance was measured at 390 nm. Hydrogen peroxide content in the plant material was determined using a calibration graph and expressed in nmol H
