<p>Homogenization of the plant material (0.5 g) was performed using a cooled mortar and pestle in a mixture of 20% polyvinylpyrrolidone and 0.1% trichloroacetic acid. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000×

 <xref rid="B60-plants-10-00157" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Briefly, the supernatant was added to 5% thiobarbituric acid solution in 20% trichloroacetic acid solution and incubated in a water bath at 95 °C for 30 min. Then, the reaction was stopped by placing the tubes on ice for 10 min. The mixture was centrifuged at 10,000×
