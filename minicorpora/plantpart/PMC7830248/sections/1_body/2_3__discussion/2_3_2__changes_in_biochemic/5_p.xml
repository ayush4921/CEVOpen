<p>Accumulation of dehydroascorbic and 2,3-diketogulonic acids at high oil concentrations can be also considered as an evidence of the shift in redox processes in rye plant cells towards oxidation. The oxidation of AsA to DHA is reversible; however, DHA can be irreversibly hydrolyzed to 2,3-diketogulonic acid. The content of 2,3-diketogulonic acids in plant tissues is an indicator of the process direction in the AsA-DHA system. It depends on the activity of enzymes that oxidize AsA (for example, ascorbate peroxidase and ascorbate oxidase), the activity of enzymes involved in DHA reduction (dehydroascorbate reductase and monodehydroascorbate reductase), and the presence of reducing agents such as glutathione and NADPH in the cell [
