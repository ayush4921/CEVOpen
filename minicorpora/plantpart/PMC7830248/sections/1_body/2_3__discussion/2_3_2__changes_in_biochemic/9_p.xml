<p>It is known that plant resistance to free radicals is also associated with an increase in the activities of antioxidative enzymes after exposure to pollutants [

The current study revealed an increase in SOD activity in shoots of both rye varieties with an increase in the oil concentration in the soil, which indicated that antioxidative defense mechanisms were activated in the plant. However, the increase in SOD activity was insufficient at high oil concentrations in the soil, since the peroxidation level remained high enough which was proved by the high content of malondialdehyde in these plants.
