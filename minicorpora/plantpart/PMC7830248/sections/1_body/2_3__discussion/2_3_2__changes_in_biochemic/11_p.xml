<p>Non-protein thiols, such as glutathione and cysteine, are involved in several biological processes in the cell including the cellâ€™s defense against the reactive oxygen species [
 <xref rid="B55-plants-10-00157" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The current study determined a slight decrease in the content of non-protein thiols at low oil concentrations as well as stimulation of its accumulation at medium concentrations. At the maximum oil concentration in the soil, the content of non-protein thiols was minimal in shoots of both rye varieties. On the one hand, the result obtained can be attributed to activation of glutathione biosynthesis and cysteine biosynthesis in the plant qualitative response to moderate stress. On the other hand, at high oil concentrations, non-protein thiols are likely to be consumed much faster compared to its synthesis. Studies of the effect of different cadmium concentrations on
