<p>The response of most of the studied enzymes (CAT, APX, and GPX) to soil contamination with crude oil depended on the oil concentration and rye variety. Thus, compared to the control, an increase in activities of these enzymes was revealed only at certain oil concentrations (for example, for catalase at 1.5â€“6.0% and for glutathione peroxidase at 1.5% in the Krona variety, and at 1.5 and 3% in the Valdai variety, respectively). Dependence of catalase activity changes on the oil concentration in the soil was previously shown in the study on jojoba plants [

Due to the fact that antioxidative enzymes are only part of a complex finely regulated antioxidative system of plant defense against adverse environmental factors, the changes in their activity or gene expression, as a rule, depends on species and variety of plants, type of an impact, strength (dose) of an impact, and duration of exposure.
