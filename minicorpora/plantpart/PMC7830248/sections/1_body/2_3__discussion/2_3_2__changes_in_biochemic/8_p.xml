<p>Similar to proline, content of phenolic compounds in both rye varieties increased with an increase in the oil concentration of soils. Plants are known to enhance the synthesis of polyphenols such as phenolic acids and flavonoids under abiotic stress conditions (drought, salinity, high/low temperature, ultraviolet radiation, and heavy metals) that enables them to resist to adverse environmental factors. The biosynthesis of phenolics under stressful environments is regulated by the altered activities of various key enzymes of phenolic biosynthetic pathways and by the up-regulation of the transcript levels of genes encoding these enzymes [

In conditions of soil oil pollution, the induction of phenolic compounds biosynthesis in plants can be determined by an increase in ROS content and by a deficiency of mineral nutrients such as nitrogen or phosphorus, which is observed at a high oil concentration in the soil [

To the best of our knowledge, there have been no previous studies on the change in the gene expression of phenylpropanoids biosynthesis in the conditions of crude oil-polluted soil. Further studies will make it possible to broaden the understanding of the mechanisms of the secondary plant metabolism response to the oil-polluted soil.
