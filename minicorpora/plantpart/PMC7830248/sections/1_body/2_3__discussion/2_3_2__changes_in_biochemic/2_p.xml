<p>One of the clusters included chlorophylls, the content of which sharply decreased in rye shoots of both varieties with an increase in the oil concentration in the soil. It is known that the photosynthetic apparatus of plants in general and their chlorophyll level in particular are very sensitive to unfavorable factors. Despite the fact that, in some studies, it was shown that content of chlorophylls is not an accurate tool for forecasting plant response to environmental stress [
 <xref rid="B40-plants-10-00157" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], the content of photosynthetic pigments in leaves turns out to be an indirect indicator reflecting the efficiency of photosynthesis. As shown in previous research [
 <xref rid="B41-plants-10-00157" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], mechanisms of inhibitory effects of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons on photosynthetic processes includes damage to the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane and then violation of lipid bilayer membranes of cell organelles and generation of ROS. As a result, this leads to a violation in the PS-2 antennae complex, increase in the content of PS-2 QB-non-reducing complexes, enhancement of heat dissipation of absorbed energy in PS-2, and to a decrease in content of photosynthetic pigments [
