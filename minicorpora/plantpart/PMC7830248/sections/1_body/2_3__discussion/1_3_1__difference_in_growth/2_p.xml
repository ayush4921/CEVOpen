<p>At the same time, a stimulating effect of low oil concentrations (1.5 and 3%) on the biomass growth of Valdai variety was detected. Similar results on the dual effect of oil on plant growth and development were obtained by Ayotamuno and Kogbara [
 <xref rid="B27-plants-10-00157" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] while investigating the effects of different oil concentrations on maize plants. The authors revealed that maize could survive soil pollution of about 21% and produce fresh cob yield of about 60% than on the normal soil. At a lower level of soil contamination with oil (12.5%), there was a stimulated increase in the fresh cob yield of maize. This stimulating effect could be attributed to the bacterial breakdown of the hydrocarbons, release of nutrients from the oil, or hormonal influence [
