<p>The effect of crude oil on plants depends on a number of factors, among which the plant species and plant variety prove to be of great importance. The current study was devoted to investigating the effect of different oil concentrations on two rye varietiesâ€“Krona and Valdai. Previous studies have shown that these varieties differ in winter hardiness and their resistance to low temperatures, acidification, and high content of aluminum ions in the soil [

The current study revealed that a significant decrease in shoot biomass was observed in the Krona variety at 6% oil concentration in the soil (by 24% lower compared to the control) and in the Valdai variety at 12% oil concentration in the soil (by 25% lower compared to the control). The decrease in Krona shoot biomass was about 57% compared to the control at 12% oil concentration in the soil.
