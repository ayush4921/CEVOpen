<p>Root biomass turns out to be the main indicator of the plant’s ability to grow on the oil-polluted soil, since the biodegradation of hydrocarbon contaminants is particularly active in the rhizosphere. However, the current study revealed that with an increase in the oil concentration in the soil, root biomass and root length of both rye varieties sharply decreased, and appeared to be 3–4 times less than in the control at 12% oil concentration in the soil. A decrease in root biomass of plants growing on oil-polluted soils was also shown in [
