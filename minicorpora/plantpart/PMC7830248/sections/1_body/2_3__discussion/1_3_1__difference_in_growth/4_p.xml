<p>The main factors of the negative effect of soil oil pollution on plants appear to be direct toxic effect of petroleum hydrocarbons and indirect effects associated with changes in physicochemical and biochemical properties of the soil, as well as with the destruction of soil microbial communities and reduction in the diversity and the quantity of soil organisms [

The indirect effect of oil soil pollution on the physiological state of plants can also be determined by the fact that oil triggers water-stress, osmotic stress, anaerobic stress, and nutrient deficiency stress in plants via soil–root–plant interaction [

 <italic>Z. mays</italic> presented in [
 <xref rid="B39-plants-10-00157" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The analyses show that the metabolism of water uptake and osmotic homeostasis-related gene expression is predominantly influenced by the petroleum hydrocarbon treatment. However, it should be noted that the current study revealed that water content in shoots and roots of both rye varieties proved to be significantly lower only at the maximum oil concentration in the soil (12%) and did not differ from the control at lower concentrations.
