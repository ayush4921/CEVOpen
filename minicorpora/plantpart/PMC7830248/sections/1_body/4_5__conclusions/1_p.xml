<p>Based on the results of a comprehensive analysis of growth and biochemical parameters and of cluster analysis, the Valdai variety proved to be more resistant to oil pollution. In general, a weaker decrease in growth parameters and in contents of chlorophyll 
 <italic>a</italic> and total chlorophylls, as well as an increase in contents of lipid peroxidation products and oxidized forms of ascorbic acid were observed in the Valdai compared to the Krona variety at higher soil oil concentrations. At the same time, an increase in the contents of some low-molecular antioxidants (proline, non-protein thiols, ascorbic acid, and phenolic compounds) and an increase in activities of the antioxidative enzymes (SOD, CAT, APX, and GPX) were observed at different oil concentrations in the soil in both rye varieties. In order to determine the specific response of plants to oil pollution, it is necessary to conduct further studies including the study of petroleum hydrocarbons accumulation in plants, changes in the membrane structure, expression of stress-related genes and genes involved in the plant secondary metabolism, changes in phytohormones functioning and signaling pathways.
