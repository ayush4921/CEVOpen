<p>The results of the current study reveal that Valdai variety plants are able to grow on moderately oil-polluted soils (up to 3% oil concentration) without loss in growth and weight. Based on this, Valdai variety is considered to be a promising rye variety for cultivation on moderately oil-polluted soils with the aim of their decontamination. At the same time, further studies should be undertaken in order to investigate the processes of oil transformation in the soil-rye system with the consideration of the soil and rhizosphere microbiomes.</p>
