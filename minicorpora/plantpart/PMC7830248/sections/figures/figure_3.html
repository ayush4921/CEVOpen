 <caption> Effect of soil pollution with crude oil (given on X-axis in %) on contents of non-enzymatic antioxidants: ( a) proline, ( b) non-protein thiols, ( c) ascorbic acid, ( d) dehydroascorbic acid, ( e) 2,3-diketogulonic acid, and ( f) total phenolic compounds in shoots of two rye varieties. Different lower-case letters indicate significant differences between plants by oil concentration in the soil for each variety separately, and asterisks * indicate significant differences between rye varieties at p ≤ 0.05 based on post hoc Tukey’s test ( n = 4). </caption>
