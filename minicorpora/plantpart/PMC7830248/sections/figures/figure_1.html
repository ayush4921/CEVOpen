 <caption> Effect of soil pollution with crude oil (given on X-axis in %) on contents of photosynthetic pigments: ( a) chlorophyll a, ( b) chlorophyll b, ( c) total chlorophylls, and ( d) carotenoids in shoots of two rye varieties. Different lower-case letters indicate significant differences between plants by oil concentration in the soil for each variety separately, and asterisks * indicate significant differences between rye varieties at p ≤ 0.05 based on post hoc Tukey’s test ( n = 4). </caption>
