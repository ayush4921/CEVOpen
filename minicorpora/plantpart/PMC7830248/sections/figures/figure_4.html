 <caption> Effect of soil pollution with crude oil (given on X-axis in %) on the activities of antioxidative enzymes: ( a) superoxide dismutase (SOD), ( b) catalase (CAT), ( c) ascorbate peroxidase (APX), ( d) glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and ( e) peroxidase (POD) in shoots of two rye varieties. Different lower-case letters indicate significant differences between plants by oil concentration in the soil for each variety separately, and asterisks * indicate significant differences between rye varieties at p ≤ 0.05 based on post hoc Tukey’s test ( n = 4). </caption>
