 <bold>Chemical analysis of EOs. </bold>The analysis of EOs was performed on a gas chromatograph (6890; Agilent, Palo Alto, USA) interfaced to a mass selective detector (5973N; Agilent). A vaporization injector working in the split mode (1:50) equipped with a fused silica capillary column (30.00 m length × 0.32 mm internal diameter × 0.25 μm film thickness; HP-5MS; 5.00% diphenyl, 95.00% dimethyl polydimethylsiloxane; Agilent) was used at 250 ˚C. The temperature of the oven was programmed at 45.00 ˚C for 1 min, raised to 250 ˚C with a speed of 5.00 ˚C per min, and maintained at 250 ˚C for 5 min. Helium was utilized as a carrier gas with an injection speed of 30 cm per sec and an injection volume of 1.00 μL. The transfer line temperature was set at 280 ˚C, ion source temperature was maintained at 230 ˚C, and the temperature of the quadrupole analyzer was kept at; 150 ˚C. A turbomolecular pump with a pressure of 10
 <sup>-5</sup> Torr was utilized. Electron ionization mass spectra between 40.00 - 400 were recorded in the full-scan mode at 70.00 eV. A solvent delay was set at 3 min. The acquisition data and device control were carried out using the MSD Chem Station Software (version C.00.00; Agilent). The identity of all compounds was allocated through comparing their retention index with a standard mixture of 
 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes, 14 and through comparing with the mass spectra characteristic properties acquired using Wiley’s library spectral data bank (G1035B, Rev D.02.00; Agilent).
