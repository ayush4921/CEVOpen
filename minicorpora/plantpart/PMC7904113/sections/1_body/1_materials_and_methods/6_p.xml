 </sup> Broth microdilution technique was performed in sterile U-bottom microtiter plates (Spektar, Čačak, Serbia). The inoculum density was set to 0.50 McFarland, diluted 10 times in sterile saline and 5.00 μL of this suspension was inoculated in 0.10 mL of cation adjusted MHB (CAMHB; Becton and Dickinson Co., Sparks, USA) to reach final inoculum of 5.00 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> CFU per well. The active substance was diluted in aqueous dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO; Sigma-Aldrich) and added to CAMHB from 0.01 mg mL
 <sup>-1</sup> to 40.96 mg mL
 <sup>-1</sup> by two-fold dilution in 96-well microtiter plates. To assess all probable pollutions corresponding to the culture medium only MHB with EOs was applied as a negative control; and the media with bacterial suspensions were utilized as positive controls. Incubation of plates at 37.00 ˚C was carried out for 24 hr. The MIC was determined as a minimum level of an antibacterial ‎‎agent inhibiting the visible growth of a microorganism in the broth dilution susceptibility test.
