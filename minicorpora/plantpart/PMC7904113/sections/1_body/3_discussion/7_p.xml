 </sup> The DPPH assay is popular in natural product antioxidative ‎ studies. Bleaching the purple-colored methanolic solution of DPPH was used to measure the electrons donation potential of the relating extracts and several pure compounds. The antioxidative ‎ activity corresponding to EOs was showed with their DPPH radical scavenging efficiency relating to the content of EOs. The lower absorbance of the reaction solution indicates higher free radical scavenging performance.

 </sup> The DPPH radical-scavenging activities of four EOs are displayed in results. The highest antioxidative activity was observed in ZEO. The major compound of ZEO was thymol (40.00%) followed by carvacrol (31.12%) (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The metabolic mechanism of the carvacrol and thymol creation starts with the autoxidation of c-terpinene to p-cymene and continues by hydroxylation to thymol.
