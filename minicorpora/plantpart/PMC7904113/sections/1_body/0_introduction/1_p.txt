0: Essential oils (EOs) are oily liquids achieved from plants.
1: Several methods can be used to obtain EOs, but the steam technique is usually applied for the commercial fabrication of EOs.
2: 1 The researches on the properties of food and the effect of EOs against an extensive range of microorganisms; have been intensified.
3: 2,3 It is common knowledge that EOs are characterized by changes in their chemical composition.
4: 4Origanum vulgare (OEO),  Zataria multiflora (ZEO),  Syzygium aromaticum (ZEO),  Cinnamomum verum (CEO) EOs have been used in food preservation.
5: Origanum vulgare is an herb belonging to the Lamiaceae family; found throughout Asia; and Europe.
6: 5,6 The OEO is recognized for its anti-oxidative  and antibacterial activities.
7: Reportedly, OEO  has an antioxidative  effect.
8: 7-9Zataria multiflora is a popular spice and thyme-like EOs-bearing plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family.
9: 10,11 Recent  in vitro studies have shown that the CEO effectively inhibits food spoilage and bacterial growth.
10: 12 Besides its antibacterial activity, this EO has multiple useful impacts on health.
11: 13,14 Therefore, it is considered an effective alternative food preservative agent.
12: Studies on the influence of the EOs on  Listeria monocytogenes and  Escherichia coli O157:H7 and specific spoilage organisms (SSOs) including  Shewanellaputrefaciens and  Pseudomonas fluorescens are limited; therefore, researches on the comprehensive assessment of the inhibitory effects of EOs on microflora are needed.
13: Some researchers have evaluated the performance of EOs; however, there has been no comprehensive and comparative research on the chemical composition, anti-bacterial and antioxidative  properties of the tested EOs.
