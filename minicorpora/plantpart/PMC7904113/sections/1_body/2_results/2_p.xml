 <bold>activity of EOs. </bold>The results regarding the disc diffusion technique varied at a great extent (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The majority of bacteria were sensitive to four applied EOs. The ZEO produced a zone of inhibition in the disk diffusion test greater than the zones of inhibition for the others; therefore, ZEO had the highest inhibitory effect against 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7
 <italic>, S. putrefaciens,</italic> and 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic>
 <italic>.</italic> The
 <italic> E. coli </italic>O157:H7 was the most sensitive bacterium to ZEO. Different volumes of ZEO (5.00, 10.00, 15.00; and 20.00 μL per disc) were determined by disk diffusion method and inhibition zones (12.00 ± 0.80 mm, 15.00 ± 1.00 mm, 19.00 ± 0.50 mm; and 24.00 ± 1.10, respectively) were measured. After that, OEO was more effective than other EOs against these bacteria. The most sensitive among these bacteria to OEO was 
 <italic>S. putrefaciens. </italic>Different volumes of OEO (5.00, 10.00, 15.00; and 20.00 μL per disc) were determined by disk diffusion method and inhibition zones were measured (11.00 ± 0.70 mm, 13.00 ± 0.50, 17.00 ± 1.20, 22.00 ± 0.80 mm, respectively).
