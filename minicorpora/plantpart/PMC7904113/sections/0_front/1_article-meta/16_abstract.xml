 <p>Essential oils (EOs) have been utilized as a growth inhibitor of microorganisms. This study was aimed to recognize the composition, antioxidative‎, antibacterial‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎, and time-kill activities of 
  <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic>, 
  <italic>Zataria multiflora</italic>, 
  <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic>; and 
  <italic>Cinnamomum verum</italic> EOs against 
  <italic>Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli </italic>O157:H7,
  <italic> Shewanella</italic>
  <italic>putrefaciens</italic> and 
  <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic>. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to determine the chemical composition of EOs. Disc diffusion, minimum inhibitory concentration, minimum bactericidal concentration, and time-kill methods were used to determine the antibacterial ‎‎activity of EOs. The antioxidative ‎ activity of EOs were determined by 2, 20-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging and ferric reducing antioxidative ‎ power methods. All EOs exhibited antibacterial ‎‎activity, however, 
  <italic>Z. multiflora</italic> EO was the most effective followed by
  <italic> O. vulgare </italic>EO
  <italic>.</italic> The lowest antibacterial‎‎‎‎‎ activity was observed in 
  <italic>C. verum</italic> EO. The most sensitive among tested bacteria to 
  <italic>Z. multiflora </italic>and 
  <italic>O. vulgare </italic>EOs was 
  <italic>E. coli </italic>O157:H7 and to 
  <italic>S. aromaticum</italic>; and 
  <italic>C. verum</italic> EOs were 
  <italic>S. putrefaciens</italic> and 
  <italic>P. fluorescens</italic>, respectively
  <italic>.</italic>
  <italic>Z. multiflora </italic>and 
  <italic>O. vulgare </italic>EOs were able to kill 85.00% and 80.00% of the 
  <italic>E. coli </italic>O157: H7 and 
  <italic>S.</italic>
  <italic>putrefaciens </italic>cells in 4 hr, respectively. The highest antioxidative ‎activity was observed in 
  <italic>Z. multiflora</italic> EO. The tested EOs showed the highest antioxidative ‎activity at a concentration of 2.00 g L
  <sup>-1</sup>. Ferric reducing antioxidant power value of 
  <italic>Z. multiflora, O. vulgare</italic>, 
  <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> and 
  <italic>C. verum</italic> was 2.01 ± 0.03, 1.47 ± 0.04, 1.01 ± 0.03, and 0.66 ± 0.34, respectively. High concentrations of tested EOs showed a decrease in antioxidative ‎ activity.
