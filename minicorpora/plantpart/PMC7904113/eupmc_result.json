    "Essential oils (EOs) have been utilized as a growth inhibitor of microorganisms. This study was aimed to recognize the composition, antioxidative‎, antibacterial‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎, and time-kill activities of <i>Origanum vulgare</i>, <i>Zataria multiflora</i>, <i>Syzygium aromaticum</i>; and <i>Cinnamomum verum</i> EOs against <i>Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli</i> O157:H7, <i>Shewanella</i> <i>putrefaciens</i> and <i>Pseudomonas fluorescens</i>. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to determine the chemical composition of EOs. Disc diffusion, minimum inhibitory concentration, minimum bactericidal concentration, and time-kill methods were used to determine the antibacterial ‎‎activity of EOs. The antioxidative ‎ activity of EOs were determined by 2, 20-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging and ferric reducing antioxidative ‎ power methods. All EOs exhibited antibacterial ‎‎activity, however, <i>Z. multiflora</i> EO was the most effective followed by <i>O. vulgare</i> EO<i>.</i> The lowest antibacterial‎‎‎‎‎ activity was observed in <i>C. verum</i> EO. The most sensitive among tested bacteria to <i>Z. multiflora</i> and <i>O. vulgare</i> EOs was <i>E. coli</i> O157:H7 and to <i>S. aromaticum</i>; and <i>C. verum</i> EOs were <i>S. putrefaciens</i> and <i>P. fluorescens</i>, respectively<i>.</i> <i>Z. multiflora</i> and <i>O. vulgare</i> EOs were able to kill 85.00% and 80.00% of the <i>E. coli</i> O157: H7 and <i>S.</i> <i>putrefaciens</i> cells in 4 hr, respectively. The highest antioxidative ‎activity was observed in <i>Z. multiflora</i> EO. The tested EOs showed the highest antioxidative ‎activity at a concentration of 2.00 g L<sup>-1</sup>. Ferric reducing antioxidant power value of <i>Z. multiflora, O. vulgare</i>, <i>S. aromaticum</i> and <i>C. verum</i> was 2.01 ± 0.03, 1.47 ± 0.04, 1.01 ± 0.03, and 0.66 ± 0.34, respectively. High concentrations of tested EOs showed a decrease in antioxidative ‎ activity."
