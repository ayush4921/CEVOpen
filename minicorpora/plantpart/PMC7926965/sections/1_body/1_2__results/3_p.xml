<p>The MIC values mentioned before (
 <xref rid="antibiotics-10-00222-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) were used to perform the time-kill assay. Each strain was exposed to different concentrations of EO (0.5 MIC, 1 MIC, 2 MIC, 4 MIC, 8 MIC, and a control without EO). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00222-f001">Figure 1</xref> shows the time-kill assay for the reference strain and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00222-f002">Figure 2</xref> the wild types. In both cases, we evaluated 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> behavior at pH 7.4, 6.5, and 5.0 in the presence and absence of EO.
