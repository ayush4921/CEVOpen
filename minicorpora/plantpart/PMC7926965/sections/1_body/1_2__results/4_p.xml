<p>The bacterial growth curves were modeled with the Gompertz equation. The data obtained are presented in 
 <xref rid="antibiotics-10-00222-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> (reference strain) and 
 <xref rid="antibiotics-10-00222-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> (wild-type strains). At pH 6.5 and 5.0, there was a decrease in the bacterial count for 0.5 MIC; therefore, it was not possible to analyze them with this model.
