<p>The data obtained in the time-kill assay allowed us to obtain index E (antibacterial effect) of the antibacterial activity. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00222-f003">Figure 3</xref>, index E vs. the EO concentration is plotted at the three different pH evaluated. In this way, it is possible to observe the incidence of pH in the drop of the bacterial count added to the effect of the EO. 
 <xref rid="antibiotics-10-00222-t008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref> shows the parameters obtained after modeling this data with the sigmoid model.
