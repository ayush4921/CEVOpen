 <xref rid="antibiotics-10-00222-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> is shown the composition of the EO extracted. The 
 <italic>M. armillaris</italic> EO isolated for this work presented a liquid consistency with a pale-yellow color and a penetrating and fresh odor. The other parameters analyzed were the refractive index; density; pH; solubility in mineral oil, ethanol 70%, and water; acid value; and esterification index (
