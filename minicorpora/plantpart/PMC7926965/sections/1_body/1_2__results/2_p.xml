<p>For the MIC determination assay, erythromycin was used for the quality check of the microdilution method. The MIC of this antibiotic was 0.5 μg/mL for 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 29213 at pH 7.4 (it must range between 0.25 and 1 μg/mL, according to the CLSI (2013) [
 <xref rid="B26-antibiotics-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]). The MIC of 
 <italic>M. armillaris</italic> EO necessary to inhibit 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 29213 was 25 µL/mL at pH 7.4 and 6.5 but decreased twofold at pH 5.0. Concerning wild-type strains, the MIC was 12.5 µL/mL at pH 7.4 for all strains, without a change at pH 6.5 for three strains (SA13, SA96, and SA139) and decreasing by half for the other strains at pH 6.5 (SA78A, SA79A, and SA86B). Variations may be due to the existence of bacterial subpopulations with different sensitivities. At pH 5.0, the MIC decreased by half from that obtained at pH 6.5 (6.25 and 3.1 µL/mL, respectively). Something similar occurred when evaluating the MBC, since this parameter decreased between 2 and 4 times depending on the strain, comparing what happened at pH 7.4 and 5.0. The inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of EO against the reference strain and the six wild-type strains are shown in
