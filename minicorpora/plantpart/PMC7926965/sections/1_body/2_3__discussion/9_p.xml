<p>The application of the Gompertz model to data obtained from the time-kill assay allows us to know parameters like the growth rate (μ), lag period duration (LPD), and the maximum population density (MPD). We used this model for the bacterial growth being applied for the control conditions and 0.5 MIC at pH 7.4 (

 <xref rid="antibiotics-10-00222-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). With these results, we could observe that the presence of EO diminished the μ, extended the LPD, and reduced the MPD. Something similar occurred in another study using 
 <italic>M. armillaris</italic> EO against lactic acid bacteria [

 <italic>S. aureus</italic> under acidic conditions. Weinrick et al. (2004) found that 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> in acidic conditions modifies its gene expression to promote defense mechanisms against acidity, which can lead to a slower growth rate [
