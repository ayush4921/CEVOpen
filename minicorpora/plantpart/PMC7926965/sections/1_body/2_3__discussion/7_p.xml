<p>In the case of the reference strain (ATCC 29213) at pH 7.4, it was possible to achieve a decrease of 2.6 Log
 <sub>10</sub> (colony-forming units (CFU)/mL) of the initial inoculum for concentrations of two, four, and eight times the MIC. At pH 6.5, the decrease for these concentrations was 2.8 Log
 <sub>10</sub> (CFU/mL). At pH 5.0, the decrease in inoculum was 2.8 for two MIC, 3.6 for four MIC, and 3.9 Log
 <sub>10</sub> (CFU/mL) for eight MIC. With these results, we can observe that, at higher concentrations and higher acidity, the antibacterial activity of the essential oil is higher, being similar for concentrations of four and eight MIC. For strains SA13, SA96, and SA139, the decrease in the initial inoculum for two MIC at 24 h is 2.7–3.0 Log
 <sub>10</sub> (CFU/mL) at pH 7.4, 3.0–3.2 at pH 6.5, and 2.9–3.2 at pH 5.0. As for four and eight MIC, the decrease is 2.5–3.5 Log
 <sub>10</sub> (CFU/mL) at pH 7.4, from 3.1–3.7 at pH 6.5, and 3.2–3.9 at pH 5.0. Regarding strains SA78A, SA79A, and SA86B, a fall of 3.1–3.8 Log
 <sub>10</sub> (CFU/mL) was observed for the three pH values at concentrations of four and eight MIC. In the case of the two MIC for these strains, the drop in inoculum was between 2.5 and 3.4 Log
 <sub>10</sub> (CFU/mL). The strains analyzed had slight differences in susceptibility against the EO but the antimicrobial activity improvement by increasing the acidity and EO concentration was common.
