<p>The 
 <italic>M. armillaris</italic> EO mechanism of action has not yet been investigated against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Hayouni et al. (2008) studied the antimicrobial activity of this species against different 
 <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species [
 <xref rid="B6-antibiotics-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. As 1.8 cineole was the main component found (68.92%), these authors hypothesized that this compound could have destabilized the cytoplasmic membrane of these bacteria, as was demonstrated by Li et al. (2014) [
 <xref rid="B29-antibiotics-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, the way of action postulated for 
 <italic>M. armillaris</italic> by Hayouni et al. (2008) also involved the minority components found (α-pinene, terpinen-4-ol, sabinene, β-myrcene, and α-terpinene, among others) [
 <xref rid="B6-antibiotics-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. According to these authors, these molecules interact with the cell membrane, where they dissolve in the phospholipid bilayer, aligning themselves between the fatty acid chains. This distortion of the physical structure would cause the expansion and destabilization of the membrane, increasing the fluidity of the membrane, which, in turn, would increase the passive permeability.
