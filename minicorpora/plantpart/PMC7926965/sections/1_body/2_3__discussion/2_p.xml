<p>Falci et al. (2015) studied the composition and the antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of a 
 <italic>Melaleuca</italic> species (not specified) cultivated in Brazil [
 <xref rid="B28-antibiotics-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This essential oil had 70.8% of 1.8 cineole, 8.95% of terpineol, and 8.25% of limonene. The amount of 1.8 cineole, limonene, and myrcene (1.99%) was similar to the essential oil of 
 <italic>M. armillaris</italic> obtained in this work. Although the specie of 
 <italic>Melaleuca</italic> is not specified, parallelism can be made with the composition of the mentioned essential oil. These authors demonstrated an important antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains with MIC values between 1 and 2 µL/mL and MBC between 2 and 4 µL/mL. Li et al. (2014) found that the MIC of 1.8 cineol against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 25923 was 6.25 μL/mL [
 <xref rid="B29-antibiotics-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Those value reported were lower than the obtained in the present study. This can be attributed to a greater sensitivity of the 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains used by the authors and/or incidences in the antimicrobial activity of the rest of the minority components.
