<p>Physicochemical characterization is important to assess the quality of essential oils. It is very important for the standardization and design of commercial products, especially if they are destined for food and healthcare in both animal and human medicines. There is no information in the literature to compare the physicochemical parameters we obtained. These represent a starting point for the standardization of 
 <italic>M. armillaris</italic> EO and consider them for quality control. The chromatographic analysis of this EO revealed the presence of 1.8 cineol as the main component (72.3%) and limonene (7.8%) and Î±-pinene (6.0%). These are commonly present in essential oils with high antimicrobial activity. The 1.8 cineole is a monocyclic monoterpene with an important antimicrobial activity and was found as the main component in 
 <italic>M. armillaris</italic> EO in other works [

 <xref rid="B7-antibiotics-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This compound is, in general, also the major compound in the essential oil of Eucalyptus species [
