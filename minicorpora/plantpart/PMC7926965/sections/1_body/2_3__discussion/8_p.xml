<p>The mathematical modeling of a microorganism response at different conditions or with an inhibitor compound is very useful to understand its behavior and to predict the efficacy of a treatment under controlled conditions. To assess the validity of the model applied, the model must have a good fit to experimental data in terms of R
 <sup>2</sup>, which must range between 0 and 1; the adjustment is better if this parameter is nearer to 1 [
