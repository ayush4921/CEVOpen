<p>The antibacterial effect (Index E) of EO is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00222-f003">Figure 3</xref>. The EO improves its antimicrobial activity at a lower pH, since lower concentrations are required to achieve the same effect. This behavior was similar for both the reference and wild-type strains. Modeling this data by applying a sigmoid model let us obtain different valuable parameters (
 <xref rid="antibiotics-10-00222-t008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>), such as the concentration necessary to reach 50% of the maximum effect (C
 <sub>50</sub>). This parameter was smaller at lower pH for all the strains evaluated. Another important parameter is the E
 <sub>max</sub>; this decreases at acidic pH, but we must consider that the E
 <sub>0</sub> is also smaller; this is because 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> is slightly susceptible at acidic pH. The lower maximum antibacterial effect at a lower pH may be influenced by a lower bacterial growth capacity, coinciding with that demonstrated by Weinrick et al. (2004) [
 <xref rid="B35-antibiotics-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. At high concentrations, the antibacterial effect was similar (and close to virtual eradication) for the three pH, while at acidic pH, the E
 <sub>0</sub> was lower, which affected the value of the E
 <sub>max</sub>.
