<p>The high content of 1.8 cineol may be one of the factors that contribute to the antibacterial activity of the EO, to which the permeabilization of the membranes of microorganisms such as 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> has been attributed as an antimicrobial action mechanism due to its great hydrophobicity [

 <xref rid="B31-antibiotics-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This compound is usually the most abundant in 
 <italic>Eucalyptus globulus</italic> essential oil. Yáñez Rueda and Cuadro Mogollón (2012) found an important activity for this species against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 29213 (MIC of 12.4 μg/mL), in which its composition was similar to the 
 <italic>M. armillaris</italic> EO evaluated in this work: 1.8 cineol (82.27%), limonene (3.70%), α-pinene (3.16%), terpinen-4-ol (1.4%), α-terpineol (1.2%), β-myrcene (1.12%), and α-terpinene (1.1%), among others [

 <italic>S. aureus</italic>.
