<p>According to the ratio of MIC/MBC, an antimicrobial may be considered bactericidal or bacteriostatic. A compound is bacteriostatic if the MBC/MIC ratio is greater than 4 [
 <xref rid="B33-antibiotics-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Analyzing the MIC and MBC of the EO, we found that, for strains SA13, SA96, and SA139, these parameters were the same, and this coincidence was maintained even when the pH conditions were modified. For the other strains, the MBC/MIC ratio was between 2 and 4, maintaining the ratio when acidifying the culture medium. Therefore, it could be considered that the EO of 
 <italic>M. armillaris</italic> has bactericidal activity against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, which is independent of the pH.
