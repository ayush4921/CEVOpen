<p>The MIC and MBC are the parameters most used to quantify the antibacterial activity of a drug against an infectious pathogen. However, the temporal evaluation of different concentrations of the antimicrobial against a microorganism allows a better description of the magnitude of its antibacterial effect [
 <xref rid="B34-antibiotics-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. For this reason, it is also important to analyze what occurs over time through the construction of bacterial death curves. In the time-kill assay for the EO against

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00222-f002">Figure 2</xref>), it is possible to observe a decrease in the bacterial count after being exposed to the EO. In general, a slight drop in the slope of the curve was observed with a concentration equivalent to the MIC of the essential oil against each strain and isolate. However, for concentrations of 0.5 MIC, a relevant rate of growth was not perceived, and in many cases, there was a decrease in the initial inoculum. For concentrations of two, four, and eight times the MIC, a drop in the bacterial cell count was evidenced at two hours, continuing the decrease exponentially until 8â€“12 h and then maintaining the bacterial count until 24 h after assay started. This pattern was generally maintained for all strains, even changing the pH of the medium.
