<p>At pH 6.5 and 5.0, only the control increased the bacterial count, so the Gompertz model was not applied for 0.5 MIC. In this case, and for curves obtained using one MIC, two MIC, four MIC, and eight MIC (where bacterial death was observed), we applied the sigmoid minus the base model (

 <sub>I50</sub> (time to reach 50% of the maximum drop in the bacterial count, N
 <sub>max</sub>). This parameter is lower while the EO concentration increases, and the reduction is independent of the pH. On the other hand, N
 <sub>max</sub> is much closer to N
 <sub>0</sub> with a higher concentration of EO, indicating that there is a much greater bacterial effect, since it is possible to eliminate all the initial inoculum. Navarro-Cruz et al. (2018) found that, when modeling the antibacterial effect of the essential oil of
