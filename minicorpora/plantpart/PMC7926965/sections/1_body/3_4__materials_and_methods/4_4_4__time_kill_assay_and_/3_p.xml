<p>Data obtained in the time-kill assay was used to create CFU/mL vs. time graphs and to evaluate the antibacterial activity index (E). Once E indexes were obtained, we graphed the E index vs. EO concentration (Log
 <sub>10</sub>) to compare what happens at the 3 pH evaluated. The wild strains were grouped according to the MIC, obtaining two groups of three strains for each one (using the mean of triplicates for each strain). Graphics were plotted using the GraphPad Prism 6 program (GraphPad Software, Inc).
