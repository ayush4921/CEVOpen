<p>We prepared 7 tubes, one for each concentration, and a positive (without antimicrobials) and a negative (without antimicrobials and inoculums) control. Each one contained a final volume of 1 mL including MHB with 0.5% Tween 80 (pH 7.4, 6.5, and 5.0), antimicrobials, and a final inoculum of 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> CFU/mL. Incubations were carried out at 35 °C. Bacterial plate count was carried out at the initial time, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h after incubating at 35 °C by 24 h. The assay was performed in triplicate for each strain.
