<p>E index was defined as the difference in Log
 <sub>10</sub> between the bacterial count (CFU/mL) at the initial time (nt-0) and at the end of the test (nt-24): E = (nt-24) − (nt-0). We considered 3 theoretical breakpoints to establish the bacteriostatic effect (E = 0), bactericidal effect (E = −3), and effect of virtual eradication of bacteria (E = −4) [
