<p>Esterification index (defined as the number of mg of potassium hydroxide necessary to saponify the esters present in 1.0 g of sample): 2 g of sample, exactly weighed, was transferred to a 250-mL Erlenmeyer, previously weighed, and 25 mL of neutralized alcohol were added while stirring, and 1 mL of phenolphthalein (prepared in a 1% ethanol solution) was added. It was titrated with 0.5-N alcoholic potassium hydroxide until completely neutralizing the free fatty acids. Then, 25.0 mL of 0.5-N alcoholic potassium hydroxide was added. It was heated in a water bath, with an appropriate coolant to maintain reflux for 30 min, stirring frequently, and excess potassium was titrated with 0.5-N hydrochloric acid. A determination was made with a blank. The difference between the volumes, in mL, of 0.5-N hydrochloric acid consumed by the sample and the blank, multiplied by 28.05, and divided by the weight, in g, of the sample taken, is the esterification index.</p>
