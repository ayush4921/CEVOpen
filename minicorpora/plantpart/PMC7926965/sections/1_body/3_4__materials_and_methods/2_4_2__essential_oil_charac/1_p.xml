<p>The EO composition was analyzed by GC–MS-FID, as we previously described [
 <xref rid="B4-antibiotics-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. We performed assays on the established parameters of quality control commonly used for essential oils [
 <xref rid="B38-antibiotics-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] to characterize the EO of 
 <italic>M. armillaris</italic>, since it is not described in the literature. In this way, the physicochemical characteristics such as appearance at 20 °C, odor, flavor, color, refractive index, density (using a pycnometer), and pH were analyzed. Additionally, we checked the solubility in different solvents: mineral oil (1:1); water (1:10), and ethanol 70% (1:1). On the other hand, the acid value and esterification index were determined following the recommendations of Argentinian Pharmacopeia VII Ed (2013) [
