<p>Acid value (amount of free fatty acids, defined as the number of mg of potassium hydroxide necessary to neutralize the free acids present in 1.0 g of sample): 10.0 g of sample, exactly weighed and previously neutralized against phenolphthalein with 0.1-N sodium hydroxide, were dissolved in 50 mL of alcohol contained in an Erlenmeyer flask (Becton Dickinson
 <sup>Â®</sup>). One milliliter of phenolphthalein (prepared at 1% in alcohol) was added, and it was titrated with 0.1-N potassium hydroxide until a persistent pink coloration for 30 s. The acid number was calculated as the mg of KOH necessary to neutralize the free fatty acids in one gram of sample. All reagents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA.
