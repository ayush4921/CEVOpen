<p>Finally, we applied the sigmoid model, which is analogous to the maximum response, or Hill [

 <sub>0</sub> is the index E in the absence of the antimicrobial (Log
 <sub>10</sub> CFU/mL), E
 <sub>max</sub> is the maximum reduction in Log

 <sub>50</sub> (μL/mL) is the concentration that causes 50% of the reduction of the E
