<p>In the case of the curves where bacterial death was observed, the experimental data of CFU/mL vs. time were fitted with a sigmoid model minus the base:
 <disp-formula>N = N
  <sub>0</sub> − (N
  <sub>max</sub>. T
  <sup>γ</sup>)/(T
  <sub>I50</sub>
  <sup>γ</sup> + T
  <sup>γ</sup>)
  <label>(2)</label>
 </disp-formula> where N is the bacterial count (CFU/mL) at time T (hours), N
 <sub>0</sub> is the initial inoculum concentration (CFU/mL), N
 <sub>max</sub> is the maximum drop in the bacterial count (CFU/mL), T
 <sub>I50</sub> is the time necessary to reach 50% of the maximum bacterial inhibition (hours), and ϒ is the sigmoidicity coefficient. Experimental data were fitted with the nonlinear least squares regression model using the software Sigma Plot 12.0, as mentioned before.
