<p>The essential oil of 
 <italic>M. armillaris</italic> has good antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. This improves slightly with the acidification of the culture medium and presents a bactericidal activity where the MBC is close to the MIC. The analysis of biological systems using mathematical models allows to obtain more information that simplifies collecting data from the observation of the results of an in vitro test. We highlighted the antimicrobial potential of 
 <italic>M. armillaris</italic> EO against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> under acidic conditions, resulting in an interesting factor for the control of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections and food contamination.
