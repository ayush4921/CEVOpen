0: S. aureus is recognized worldwide as a causative pathogen of different types of infections in humans and animals.
1: Moreover, it is commonly found in animals that are intended for food production such as dairy cows, sheep, and goats, particularly when they are affected by subclinical mastitis [ 11], and represent a high risk for human consumption [ 12].
2: This microorganism can express a wide spectrum of pathogenic factors used to colonize, invade, and infect the host [ 13].
3: This pathogen can survive intracellularly contributing to the recurrence of infections like mastitis in cows.
4: Despite several ATMs showing good in vitro activity, the cure rates are low, because the bacteria do not fade to adequate concentrations and exposure times sufficient to eradicate them [ 14].
5: This may be related to the low intracellular penetration of some ATMs or their loss of activity at the acidic pH of lysosomes, the low diffusion of acidic ATMs through the lysosomal membrane due to their high ionization at neutral extracellular or cytoplasmic pH, and the poor retention of ATMs inside that enter freely [ 15].
6: Ideally, the ATMs needed to treat these infections should penetrate the phagocytic cells in adequate concentrations and time, not be metabolized in the cells, and be active at acidic pH [ 16].
