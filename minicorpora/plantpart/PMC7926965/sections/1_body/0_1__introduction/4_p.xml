<p>There are different methods to evaluate antimicrobial activity. A microdilution in broth is the most common technique, standardized by the Clinical &amp; Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). This provides very useful parameters like a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). The problem with these parameters is that they give us static information. On the other hand, the time-kill assay is a very useful method that describes the antimicrobial activity of a compound dynamically, allowing the analysis of the bacterial behavior in the presence of antimicrobial along the time [

Kinetic models can explain the behavior of a bacterial inoculum in the time because of the presence of an antimicrobial or the change of environmental variables [
