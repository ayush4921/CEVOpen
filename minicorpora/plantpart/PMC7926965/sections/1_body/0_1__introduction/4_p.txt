0: There are different methods to evaluate antimicrobial activity.
1: A microdilution in broth is the most common technique, standardized by the Clinical & Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI).
2: This provides very useful parameters like a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC).
3: The problem with these parameters is that they give us static information.
4: On the other hand, the time-kill assay is a very useful method that describes the antimicrobial activity of a compound dynamically, allowing the analysis of the bacterial behavior in the presence of antimicrobial along the time [ 21].
5: The curves (bacterial concentrations vs. time) obtained by this last kind of technic can be analyzed by mathematical models.
6: Kinetic models can explain the behavior of a bacterial inoculum in the time because of the presence of an antimicrobial or the change of environmental variables [ 22].
7: There exist several kinetic models like Gompertz and square root models that can provide the growth rate (), lag period duration (LPD), and the maximum population density (MPD) [ 23].
8: There also exist models to describe the survival or the destruction of bacteria over the time, like the sigmoid minus the base model [ 24], which is similar to E max models [ 25].
