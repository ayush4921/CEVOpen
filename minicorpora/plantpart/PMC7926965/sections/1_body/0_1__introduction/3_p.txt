0: The change of pH can influence the antimicrobial activity of the different molecules.
1: For example, -lactams increase their potency by acidifying the media [ 17], while macrolides lose their antibacterial activity with a decrease in pH [ 18].
2: This is interesting for the treatment of intracellular pathogens causing infection such as  S. aureus, which can internalize in the phagolysosome where the pH is close to 5 [ 19].
3: The susceptibility of microorganisms to EO seemed to be higher at lower pH; the hydrophobicity of EO is higher at low pH, and this favors their dissolution in the lipids of the cell membrane [ 20].
