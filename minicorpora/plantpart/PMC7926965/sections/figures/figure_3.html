 <caption> Graphic representation of the antibacterial effect (antibacterial effect (E): ΔLog colony-forming units (CFU)/mL 24–0 h) of essential oil (EO) against S. aureus ATCC 29213 ( A); wild type ( n = 3: SA13, SA96, and SA139, using the mean of triplicates for each strain) ( B); and wild type ( n = 3: SA78A, SA79A, and SA86B, using the mean of triplicates for each strain) ( C). In the three cases are plotted the E vs. EO concentration at pH 7.4, 6.5, and 5.0. </caption>
