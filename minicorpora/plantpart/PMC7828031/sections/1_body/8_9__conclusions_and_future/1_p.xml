<p>Despite the large number of activities identified in 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> fruit powder and its safety profile, highlighted in this review, little attention was given toward the exploitation of these benefits in improving the human well-being. Sumac appears to be an excellent source of new compounds offering a broad spectrum of applications in different fields such as pharmaceutical, food, and textile industries. Because of its antioxidant, antifungal, and antibacterial activities, it may prove effective to test sumac as a natural preservative in food industry. More precisely, it would be beneficial to give more attention for the potential use of sumac powder as preservative in red meat and poultry meat. Also, much taught should be given toward the possible introduction of sumac extract as a supplement or condiment where sour taste is desired and obviously this will be better than the current use of natural or synthetic compounds such as citric acid. This later application could provide the consumer important phytochemicals beneficial for health with antioxidant and antiobesogenic potentials. Also, the rich composition in tannins, the large availability and low cost of sumac powder makes it interesting for use as cheap coloring agent by the textile industry. Last, and not the least, because of its demonstrated various pharmacological virtues (anticancer, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, antinociceptive, cardioprotective, and antidiabetic) the scientific community and pharmaceutical industry should give more attention toward the use of this plant as a source for novel bioactive compounds but also to conduct toxicological studies and clinical trials to develop better alternative natural pharmaceutical drugs.
