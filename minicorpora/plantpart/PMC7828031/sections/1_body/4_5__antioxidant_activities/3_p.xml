<p>Oxidative stress, mainly via ROS, is associated with both physiology and pathology of skeletal muscle. Indeed, ROS is intimately linked to muscle fatigue [

 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> extract evoked a very powerful antioxidative effect, where it inhibited or slowed down the progress of skeletal muscle atrophy. This appears to be due to the extractâ€™s ability to suppress oxidative stress through superoxide dismutase 2 and catalase [
