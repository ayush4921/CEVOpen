 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> seems to exert its protective effects by increasing the activities of detoxifying enzymes of the overall glutathione S-transferase (GST) and the two isozymes (GST-
 <italic>α</italic> and GST-
 <italic>π</italic>) in plasma of human subject treated with sumac extract [

 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> might also reduce DNA-damage through a direct ROS scavenging activity [
 <xref rid="B57-antioxidants-10-00073" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Gallic acid, a major constituent in sumac fruit, was also shown to reduce H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-induced DNA damage in human lymphocytes in level comparable to sumac [
 <xref rid="B57-antioxidants-10-00073" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Hence, gallic acid, although maybe not solely, could account for the genoprotective effect of the sumac extract.
