<p>The anticancer activity of 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> ethanolic extract on uterus cervix cancer using HeLa cells was determined. Indeed, noncytotoxic concentrations of 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> reduced migration of HeLa cells in the wound healing assay [
 <xref rid="B31-antioxidants-10-00073" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> resin extract was also shown to cause cytotoxic and antiangiogenic effects against the retinoblastoma Y79 cell line [
 <xref rid="B120-antioxidants-10-00073" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. Unfortunately, investigations undertaken to conclusively assess the anticancer activity of 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> against uterus cervix and retinoblastoma cancer are still insufficient. As such, in vitro and in vivo studies are recommended to delineate the potential anticancer efficacy of this plant against these two forms of cancer.
