<p>Our group was also the first to investigate the anticancer effect of

 <xref rid="B118-antioxidants-10-00073" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. Interestingly, in colon cancer, RCE activates both cellular programmed cell death (apoptosis and autophagy) pathways. Mechanistically, RCE exerts these effects through a stimulation of global protein ubiquitination and the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). As a consequence, component of the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway along with other proteins such as p53, Beclin-1, and caspase-3 were targeted to proteasomal degradation. The role of the UPS in RCE -mediated anti-colon cancer effect was further confirmed using inhibitors of proteasome activity. Indeed, MG132 significantly reduced RCE-induced apoptotic and autophagic cell death of colon cancer. Further investigations are underway to isolate the compound(s) modulating proteasome activity in colon cancer cells.
