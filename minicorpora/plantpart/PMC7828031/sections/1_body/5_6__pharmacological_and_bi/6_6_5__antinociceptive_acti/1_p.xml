<p>Pain is an unpleasant sensation associated with many ailments. It has always been a serious challenge in medicine to find effective pain medication with fewer side effects. Therefore, the focus toward the use of medicinal plants has been increasing in recent years. A study investigating the analgesic effects of 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> hydroalcoholic leaf extract showed a significant reduction in writhing in Wistar rats pretreated with sumac extract [
 <xref rid="B101-antioxidants-10-00073" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. This sumac-modulated reduction in writhing was concomitant with the increase in the tail-flick time and inhibition of both phases of the formalin test, suggestive of an antinociceptive effect of 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic>. Hence, these results allude to the notion that the pain-relieving effect of sumac may be mediated through both peripheral and central mechanisms [
 <xref rid="B101-antioxidants-10-00073" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Based on these findings, 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> can be a potential source for the novel, natural, and safe compounds with an analgesic effect and thus deserves further investigation in clinical trials.
