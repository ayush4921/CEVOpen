<p>Enzymatic degradation of the dentin matrices results in the loss of stability of resinâ€“dentin bonds built by contemporary adhesives [

 <xref rid="B142-antioxidants-10-00073" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. Even though MMPs are inactive in mineralized dentin, the application of acidic monomers or etching acids can uncover and activate these proteases causing a progressive loss, over time, of collagen from the composite layers of tooth [
 <xref rid="B143-antioxidants-10-00073" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]. A study by Seseogullari-Dirihan et al. evaluated the MMP activity of demineralized dentin matrix following pretreatment by various collagen crosslinkers including 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> fruit extract [
 <xref rid="B144-antioxidants-10-00073" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. This extract significantly reduced total dentin MMP activity compared to control [

 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> extract confirmed a decrease in MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities. Furthermore, multiplex bead analysis of extracts of 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic>-treated dentin showed a reduction in the release of MMP-8, MMP-2, and MMP-9 [
 <xref rid="B144-antioxidants-10-00073" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. Thus, 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> may serve as a source for new MMP inhibitors that could be useful in the prevention or treatment of dental disease.
