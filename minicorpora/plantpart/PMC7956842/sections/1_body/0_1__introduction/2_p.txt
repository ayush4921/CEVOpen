0: Another major concern about essential oils and their constituents is mimicking, interfering with, or antagonizing the action of reproductive hormones, which in turn could disrupt the reproductive and developmental processes [ 11].
1: Some EO constituents could affect the outcome of pregnancy through causing maternal toxicity, teratogenicity, embryo-fetotoxicity, or anti-angiogenicity [ 12].
2: Since angiogenesis is essential for a successful pregnancy, anti-angiogenic oil constituents carry the risk of causing preeclampsia, growth restriction, and fetal death [ 13, 14].
3: Moreover, at high doses, teratogenic oils or components can cause birth defects of a structural nature that arise during embryonic development [ 15].
4: Generally, EO components can cross the placenta to the fetal circulation due to their low molecular weight, protein binding ability, and lipophilicity and can cause fetotoxicity [ 16].
5: Components that cross the placenta are more likely to affect the fetal central nervous system (CNS) since it is underdeveloped [ 17].
6: Unsaturated compounds like cinnamaldehyde, citral, and -pulegone act via interacting with the lipids in embryo cell membranes [ 18].
7: Subcutaneous injection of 1,8-cineole (at 500 mg/kg for four days) to pregnant rats affected the fetal liver enzymes activity [ 19].
8: Similar to crossing the placenta, most flavor and EO constituents are expected to pass into breast milk via passive diffusion [ 20].
9: In lactating mice, constituents of sandalwood oil were able to pass to maternal milk and affected infant hepatic metabolic enzymes [ 21].
