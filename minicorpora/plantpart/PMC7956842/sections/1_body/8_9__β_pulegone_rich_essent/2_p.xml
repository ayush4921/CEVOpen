<p>For a long time, pennyroyal has been used as an abortifacient even with its potentially deadly hepatotoxic effects [
 <xref rid="B183-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">183</xref>]. Pennyroyal oil is hepatotoxic and neurotoxic due to the high content of (6

 <italic>R</italic>)-(+)-β-pulegone [

 <italic>Mentha pulegium</italic> oil and pulegone prevented rat uterine muscle contraction [

 <xref rid="B185-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">185</xref>]. Intraperitoneal administration of both pennyroyal oil and pulegone showed similar effects in mice [
 <xref rid="B179-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">179</xref>]. Since there is no significant medicinal benefit from using β-pulegone-rich oils and due to their hepatotoxicity and the potential of causing abortion, it is best to avoid them in pregnancy and breastfeeding [
