<p>Another sabinyl acetate-rich oil is savin oil (
 <italic>Juniperus sabina</italic> L.). Savin oil (50% sabinyl acetate) is embryo-fetotoxic, abortifacient, and hepatotoxic [
 <xref rid="B116-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. It can easily cross the placenta and cause abortion [
 <xref rid="B117-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. Subcutaneous administration of savin EO to pregnant mice (at 15, 45, or 135 mg/kg on gestational days 6–15) caused embryotoxicity and significant weight loss [
 <xref rid="B116-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. It also inhibited implantation in mice on gestational days 0–4 but not on gestational days 8–11 suggesting that sabinyl acetate causes abortion [
 <xref rid="B111-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. The abortifacient action of the savin plant does not seem to be only due to the oil. An ether extract of 
 <italic>Juniperus sabina</italic>, prepared after isolating the oil, showed anti-implantation effect in a dose-dependent manner [
 <xref rid="B118-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. Since nothing much can be gained from using savin oil, it should not be used either internally or externally. Similarly, juniper berry (
 <italic>Juniperus communis</italic> L.) ethanolic extract was clearly abortifacient [
 <xref rid="B119-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]; however, there is no evidence that the juniper berry EO is abortifacient.
