<p>Costunolide or costus lactone is a bicyclic sesquiterpenoid polyalkene lactone found in costus (
 <italic>Saussurea costus</italic> (Falc.) Lipsch.) oil (11.0%) [
 <xref rid="B35-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Costunolide is classified as a skin sensitizer (allergen) [
 <xref rid="B187-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">187</xref>]. Costunolide (i.p., at 100 mg/kg/day) showed anti-angiogenic activity through decreasing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced neovascularization in mice. It also suppressed umbilical vein endothelial cell proliferation in vitro (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 3.4 mM) [

 <xref rid="B187-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">187</xref>]. Dehydrocostus lactone exerts its anti-angiogenic action via causing G

 <sub>1</sub> cell cycle arrest due to the suppression of the Akt/glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β)/cyclin D1 and mTOR signaling pathway [
 <xref rid="B189-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">189</xref>]. Dehydrocostus lactone inhibited angiogenesis in vitro and in mice in a dose-dependent manner [
 <xref rid="B189-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">189</xref>]. Costus oil is a good example for costunolide and dehydrocostus lactone-rich essential oils [
 <xref rid="B35-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Costus EO is fetotoxic due to its costunolide and dehydrocostus lactone content. Due to the strong anti-angiogenic activity of costunolide and dehydrocostus lactones [

 <xref rid="B189-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">189</xref>] and because of the possible link between anti-angiogenic activity and reproductive toxicity [

 <xref rid="B14-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], it is best to avoid the oil (by any route) during pregnancy and lactation.
