<p>Thymoquinone is a bicyclic benzenoid ketone found in black seed (
 <italic>Nigella sativa</italic> L.) oil (26.8–54.8%) [
 <xref rid="B27-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. It showed reproductive toxicity with an i.p. NOAEL of 15 mg/kg. When administered daily to rats (i.p., at 8 mg/kg), thymoquinone killed most of the animals within a week and the surviving animals had severe peritonitis [
 <xref rid="B190-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>]. It suppressed VEGF-induced angiogenesis in the matrigel plug assay. Subcutaneous administration of thymoquinone to mice (at 6 mg/kg for 15 days) abolished angiogenesis in prostate cancer tumors [
 <xref rid="B191-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">191</xref>]. Administration of a single dose of thymoquinone (i.p., at 35 or 50 mg/kg on gestational days 11 or 14) to pregnant rats caused a dose-dependent fetal resorption and maternal toxicity [
 <xref rid="B192-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">192</xref>]. Thymoquinone (by gavage at 10 mg/kg/day on gestational days 1–19) reduced malondialdehyde formation and increased hepatic glutathione in mice with induced gestational diabetes [
 <xref rid="B193-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">193</xref>]. Due to its strong anti-angiogenic activity [
 <xref rid="B191-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">191</xref>] and reproductive toxicity, thymoquinone is mostly hazardous in pregnancy. Black seed oil may be fetotoxic because of its high thymoquinone content [
 <xref rid="B191-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">191</xref>]; therefore, its consumption during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be avoided.
