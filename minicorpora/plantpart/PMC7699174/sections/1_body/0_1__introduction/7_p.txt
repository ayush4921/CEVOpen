0: Limonoids are a group of modified triterpenes, also known as tetranortriterpenoids.
1: This class of compounds has highly oxygenated structures, derived from a precursor with a 4,4,8-trimethyl-17-furanylsteroid skeleton that is biosynthesized by the acetate-mevalonate pathway [ 15].
2: These oxidative processes and methyl group rearrangement contribute to structural diversity.
3: It is worth mentioning that limonoids can also be found in Rutaceae, Cneoraceae, Ptaeroxylaceae, and Simaroubaceae families; however, they are especially abundant and structurally diversified in the Meliaceae family [ 16]
