      "Fragrance is an integral part of cosmetic products and is often regarded as an overriding factor in the selection of cosmetics among consumers. Fragrances also play a considerable role in masking undesirable smells arising from fatty acids, oils and surfactants that are commonly used in cosmetic formulations. Essential oils are vital assets in the cosmetic industry, as along with imparting pleasant aromas in different products, they are able to act as preservatives and active agents and, simultaneously, offer various benefits to the skin. Moreover, the stimulating demand for natural ingredients has contributed massively to a renewed interest in cosmetic and wellness industries in plant derivatives, especially essential oils. This has led popular cosmetic companies to endorse natural fragrances and opt for minimally processed natural ingredients, given the potentially adverse health risks associated with artificial fragrance chemicals, which are major elements of cosmetics. Among the high-valued essential oils used as fragrances are citrus, lavender, eucalyptus, tea tree and other floral oils, among others, while linalool, geraniol, limonene, citronellol, and citral are much-appreciated fragrance components used in different cosmetics. Thus, this review aimed to highlight the enormous versatility of essential oils as significant sources of natural fragrances in cosmetics and cosmeceuticals. Moreover, a special focus will be laid on the different aspects related to essential oils such as their sources, market demand, chemistry, fragrance classification, aroma profile, authenticity and safety."

      "With insecticide-resistant mosquito populations becoming an ever-growing concern, new vector control technologies are needed. With the lack of new chemical classes of insecticides to control mosquito populations, the development of novel synergists may improve the performance of available insecticides. We screened a set of 20 plant essential oils alone and in combination with natural pyrethrins against <i>Aedes aegypti</i> (Orlando) female adult mosquitoes to assess their ability to synergize this natural insecticide. A co-toxicity factor analysis was used to identify whether plant oils modulated the toxicity of natural pyrethrins antagonistically, additively, or synergistically. Both knockdown at 1 h and mortality at 24 h were monitored. A majority of oils increased the toxicity of natural pyrethrins, either via an additive or synergistic profile. Many oils produced synergism at 2 µg/insect, whereas others were synergistic only at the higher dose of 10 µg/insect. Amyris, cardamom, cedarwood, and nutmeg East Indies (E.I.) oils were the most active oils for increasing the mortality of natural pyrethrins at 24 h with co-toxicity factors greater than 50 at either or both doses. A number of oils also synergized the 1 h knockdown of natural pyrethrins. Of these, fir needle oil and cypress oils were the most successful at improving the speed-of-action of natural pyrethrins at both doses, with co-toxicity factors of 130 and 62, respectively. To further assess the co-toxicity factor method, we applied selected plant essential oils with variable doses of natural pyrethrins to calculate synergism ratios. Only the oils that produced synergistic co-toxicity factors produced statistically significant synergism ratios. This analysis demonstrated that the degree of co-toxicity factor correlated well with the degree of synergism ratio observed (Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.94 at 2 µg/insect; r = 0.64 at 10 µg/insect) and that the co-toxicity factor is a useful tool in screening for synergistic activity."

      "The parasitic diseases represent the most important health risk, especially in underdeveloped countries where they have a deep impact on public health. Trichomoniasis is a prevalent non-viral sexually transmitted disease, and a significant amount of new cases are identified each year globally. Furthermore, the infection is linked with serious concerns such as pregnancy outcomes, infertility, predisposition to cervical and prostate cancer, and increased transmission and acquisition of HIV. The therapy is restricted, adverse effects are often observed, and resistance to the drugs is emerging. Based on this, a new treatment for trichomoniasis is necessary. Natural products represent a rich source of bioactive compounds, and even today, they are used in the search for new drugs. Additionally, natural products provide a wide variety of leadership structures that can be used by the pharmaceutical industry as a template in the development of new drugs that are more effective and have fewer or no undesirable side effects compared to current treatments. This review focuses on the medicinal plants that possess anti-trichomonal activity in vitro or in vivo. An electronic database search was carried out covering the last three decades, i.e., 1990-2020. The literature search revealed that almost a dozen isolated phytoconstituents are being explored globally for their anti-trichomonal activity. Simultaneously, many countries have their own traditional or folk medicine for trichomoniasis that utilizes their native plants, as a whole, or even extracts. This review focuses mainly on the human parasite Trichomonas vaginalis. However, at some points mention is also made to Tritrichomonas foetus that causes trichomoniasis in animals of high veterinary and economical interest. We will focus on the plants and plant-based compounds and their anti-trichomonal activity. The literature search highlighted that there are abundant compounds that possess anti-trichomonal activity; however, in-depth in-vivo evaluation of compounds and their clinical evaluation has not been undertaken. There is a critical need for new anti-trichomonal compounds, and focused research on phytoconstituents can provide the way forward."

      "The aim of this study was to evaluate occurrence of <i>T. pulegioides</i> α-terpinyl acetate chemotype, as source of natural origin α-terpinyl acetate, to determine its phytotoxic and antimicrobial features. Were investigated 131 <i>T. pulegioides</i> habitats. Essential oils were isolated by hydrodistillation and analyzed by GC-FID and GC-MS. Phytotoxic effect of essential oil of this chemotype on monocotyledons and dicotyledons through water and air was carried out in laboratory conditions; the broth microdilution method was used to screen essential oil effect against human pathogenic microorganisms. Results showed that α-terpinyl acetate was very rare compound in essential oil of <i>T. pulegioides</i>: it was found only in 35% of investigated <i>T. pulegioides</i> habitats. α-Terpinyl acetate (in essential oil and pure) demonstrated different behavior on investigated plants. Phytotoxic effect of α-terpinyl acetate was stronger on investigated monocotyledons than on dicotyledons. α-Terpinyl acetate essential oil inhibited seeds germination and radicles growth for high economic productivity forage grass monocotyledon <i>Poa pratensis</i>, but stimulated seed germination for high economic productive forage legume dicotyledon <i>Trifolium pretense</i>. α-Terpinyl acetate essential oil showed high antimicrobial effect against fungi and dermatophytes but lower effect against bacteria and <i>Candida</i> yeasts. Therefore, <i>T. pulegioides</i> α-terpinyl acetate chemotype could be a potential compound for developing preventive measures or/and drugs for mycosis."

      "<i>Thymus satureioides</i> Coss. (Lamiaceae) is a Moroccan medicinal plant locally known as \"Azkouni\" or \"Zaitra.\" It is widely used in traditional medicine to treat various ailments, including hypertension, diabetes, cold, fever, dermatological and circulatory disorders, immune problems, bronchitis, nociception, cooling, pharyngitis, cough, and influenza. The current review aims to critically summarize the literature on ethnopharmacological uses, chemical profile, and pharmacological investigations of <i>T. satureioides</i> in order to provide data support and scientific evidences for further investigations. Electronic databases such as Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, SciFinder, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, and Medline were used to gather data on <i>T. satureioides</i>. Chemical characterization of <i>T. satureioides</i> essential oils (EOs) and extracts allowed to identify a total of 139 bioactive compounds, mainly belonging to the terpenoids, phenolic acids, and flavonoids classes. <i>T. satureioides</i> especially its essential oils exhibited numerous biological activities such as antibacterial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antidiabetic, anticancer, antiparasitic, and hypolipedemic activities. In light of these findings, further studies to transmute the traditional application of <i>T. satureioides</i> into scientific-based information are strongly required. Additional <i>in vivo</i> pharmacological studies are recommended to validate the results of the <i>in vitro</i> studies. Moreover, comprehensive preclinical and clinical trials on the pharmacological mechanisms of action of this plant and its bioactive compounds on molecular targets should be performed. Finally, more efforts must be focused on toxicological assessments and pharmacokinetic studies, in order to ensure the safety and the efficiency of <i>T. satureioides</i>."

      "In the present study, the toxicity and physiological disorders of the essential oil isolated from <i>Artemisia annua</i> flowers were assessed against one of the main insect pests of mulberry, <i>Glyphodes pyloalis</i> Walker, announcing one of the safe and effective alternatives to synthetic pesticides. The LC<sub>50</sub> (lethal concentration to kill 50% of tested insects) values of the oral and fumigant bioassays of <i>A. annua</i> essential oil were 1.204 % W/V and 3.343 μL/L air, respectively. The <i>A. annua</i> essential oil<i>,</i> rich in camphor, artemisia ketone, β-selinene, pinocarvone, 1,8-cineole, and α-pinene, caused a significant reduction in digestive and detoxifying enzyme activity of <i>G. pyloalis</i> larvae. The contents of protein, glucose, and triglyceride were also reduced in the treated larvae by oral and fumigant treatments. The immune system in treated larvae was weakened after both oral and fumigation applications compared to the control groups. Histological studies on the midgut and ovaries showed that <i>A. annua</i> essential oil caused an obvious change in the distribution of the principal cells of tissues and reduction in yolk spheres in oocytes. Therefore, it is suggested that the essential oil from <i>A. annua</i> flowers, with wide-range bio-effects on <i>G. pyloalis</i>, be used as an available, safe, effective insecticide in the protection of mulberry."

      "Botanical-derived pesticides have arisen as an attractive alternative to synthetic insecticides to effectively manage infestations of bed bugs (<i>Cimex lectularius</i> L.). While information on contact, residual, and fumigant toxicity of plant-essential oils against bed bugs have been recently published, there is a gap of information regarding the repellent activity of these products and their constituents. Identification of essential oil constituents (EOCs) with repellent activity will help develop potentially efficacious essential oil-based formulations for use in bed bug management programs. In this study, we first screened fresh and 24 h-aged residues of geraniol, eugenol, carvacrol, thymol, citronellic acid, linalool, menthone, trans-cinnamaldehyde, α-pinene, β-pinene, and limonene for avoidance behavior from individual bed bugs with a video-tracking system. Six EOCs, geraniol, eugenol, citronellic acid, thymol, carvacrol, and linalool were further evaluated overnight in choice tests to determine whether 24-h aged residues were still avoided by groups of bed bugs. While bed bugs avoided resting on filter papers treated with 24-h aged residues of geraniol, eugenol, citronellic acid, and carvacrol, bed bugs aggregated in areas treated with linalool-aged residues. Barriers of EOCs did not prevent bed bugs from reaching a warmed blood source and acquiring blood meals. Our results show that novel formulations of natural product insecticides that include geraniol, eugenol, carvacrol, or citronellic acid have potential to repel bed bugs. The presence of host-associated cues might interfere with these responses."

      "<i>Syzygium aromaticum</i> has a diversity of biological activities due to the chemical compounds found in its plant products such as total phenolic compounds and flavonoids. The present work describes the chemical analysis and antimicrobial, antioxidant, and antitrypanosomal activity of the essential oil of <i>S. aromaticum</i>. Eugenol (53.23%) as the major compound was verified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. <i>S. aromaticum</i> essential oil was more effective against <i>S. aureus</i> (MIC 50 <i>μ</i>g/mL) than eugenol (MIC 250 <i>μ</i>g/mL). Eugenol presented higher antioxidant activity than <i>S. aromaticum</i> essential oil, with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 12.66 and 78.98 <i>µ</i>g/mL, respectively. <i>S. aromaticum</i> essential oil and eugenol exhibited <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i> inhibitory activity, with IC<sub>50</sub> of 28.68 ± 1.073 and 31.97 ± 1.061 <i>μ</i>g/mL against epimastigotes and IC<sub>50</sub> of 64.51 ± 1.658 and 45.73 ± 1.252 <i>μ</i>g/mL against intracellular amastigotes, respectively. Both compounds presented low cytotoxicity, with <i>S. aromaticum</i> essential oil displaying 15.5-fold greater selectivity for the parasite than the cells. Nitrite levels in <i>T. cruzi</i>-stimulated cells were reduced by essential oil (47.01%; <i>p</i> = 0.002) and eugenol (48.05%; <i>p</i> = 0.003) treatment. The trypanocidal activity of <i>S. aromaticum</i> essential oil showed that it is reasonable to use it in future research in the search for new therapeutic alternatives for trypanosomiasis."

      "Cold-pressed plant oils are of high interest to consumers due to their unique and interesting flavors. As they are usually only pressed at low temperatures and filtered, without further processing stages (as refining), they preserve their character that originates from the plant the oil was extracted from. Coriander cold pressed oil is gaining popularity as a novel product, obtained from its fruits/seeds; due to the high amount of terpenes, it has very characteristic flavor. A novel, vacuum-assisted sorbent extraction (VASE) method was used to extract terpenes from coriander cold pressed oil. Optimal parameters were determined. The profile of compounds extracted using VASE was compared with that of classic hydrodistillation method. Moreover, 17 monoterpene hydrocarbons and alcohols were identified with β-linalool as the main compound, followed by α-pinene, γ-terpinene, camphor, sylvestrene, β-pinene, and o-cymene. Differences were noted between profiles of terpenes after hydrodistillation and VASE extraction. For 8 out of 17 terpenes, VASE was used for their quantitative analysis. Regarding simplicity of the method, small sample requirement (200 mg) and short extraction time (5 min), VASE combined with GC/MS is well suited for characterization of terpenes in such matrix as plant oils."

      "<h4>Context</h4><i>Allium cepa</i> L. (Liliaceae), known as onion, is consumed throughout the world. Onion and its derivatives including saponins, aglycones, quercetin, cepaenes, flavonoids, organosulfurs, and phenolic compounds, showed various pharmacological properties and therapeutic effects.<h4>Objective</h4>Anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory effects of <i>A. cepa</i> and its main constituents, along with the underlying molecular mechanisms are presented.<h4>Methods</h4>Databases including, Web of Knowledge, Medline/PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar were checked for articles published between 1996 and the end of July 2020, using the key-words Allium cepa, quercetin, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and immunomodulatory.<h4>Results</h4><i>A. cepa</i> and its constituents mainly quercetin showed anti-inflammatory effects mediated via reduction of total and differential WBC counts, inhibition of chemotaxis of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, COX, and LOX pathways and prevented formation of leukotrienes and thromboxanes, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) as onVCAM-1, NF-κB, MARK,d STAT-1, JNK, p38 and osteoclastogenesis. <i>A. cepa</i> and its derivatives showed antioxidant effect by decreasing lipid peroxidation, NAD(P)H, MDA, NO, LPO and eNOS but enhancing antioxidants such as SOD, CAT, GSH, GPx, GSPO, TrxR, SDH, GST and GR activities and thiol level. Immunomodulatory effects of the plant and quercetin was also shown by reduction of Th2 cytokines, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 as well as IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-1β and TNF-α and IgE levels, but increased CD4 cells, IFN-γ level and IFN-γ/IL4 ratio (Th1/Th2 balance).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The effect of onion and its constituents on oxidative stress, inflammatory and immune system were shown indicating their therapeutic value in treatment of various diseases associated with oxidative stress, inflammation, and immune-dysregulation."

      "Essential oils are secondary metabolites that plants produce for protection from pests and predators, attraction of pollinators, and seed dispersal. The oils are made up of a mixture of compounds that give a characteristic flavour and odour. Currently, essential oils are receiving great attention in research for their phytochemical and antimicrobial activities. However, there is scanty information on the chemical composition of many plants. This study provides a detailed analysis of the chemical composition of essential oils of ginger, garlic, tick berry, and Mexican marigold in Kenya. The essential oils were extracted by steam distillation and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The study identified a total of 52 different chemical classes from the essential oils of the four different plants that were analysed. Their percentage composition was also found to vary between the test plants. The essential oils of Mexican marigold constituted the highest composition of the identified chemical classes at 71.2%, followed by ginger at 55.8%, while both tick berry and garlic oils constituted 53.8% of the total classes identified. Terpenes constituted the highest composition in the essential oils of all the four test plants. Other major chemical classes included esters, ketones, organosulfurs, alkanes, cycloalkanes, steroids, aromatic hydrocarbons, and alkanols. Some of these chemical compounds have been shown to have a huge utility potential in biopesticides, pharmaceutical, and food industries, and hence, their industrial extraction and purification from the essential oils of these plants are recommended."

      "<h4>Background</h4>Mosquito control programme using synthetic insecticides has been facing the challenges of resistance development. However, synergistic combinations of plant essential oils (EOs) having different modes of actions and potent lethal toxicity may further negate the concern of resistance development.<h4>Methods</h4>In this study, the toxicity of 28 EOs and the two synthetic insecticides, Temephos and Malathion were evaluated individually and based on the performance, binary combinations of effective EOs were prepared and tested against the larval and adult stages of <i>Culex quinquefasciatus</i>. Mixtures were prepared by blending LC10 or LD10 concentration/doses of candidates at different volume ratios.<h4>Results</h4>Results demonstrated that among 155 numbers of combinations of different volume ratios, 1:1 ratio of <i>A. sativum</i> (bulbs) L.+<i>C. paradisi</i> (peels) Macfd. (AsB + CpP) was found to be the most potent against adults, whereas, 1:1 volume ratio of <i>Allium sativum</i> (bulbs)+ <i>Citrus paradisi</i> (leaves) (AsB + CpL) was found to possess highest activity against larvae after considering its dose and synergistic interaction. GC-MS analysis revealed the presence of diallyl trisulfide, diallyl disulfide, beta-citronellol, ocimene as major constituents of AsB + CpP combination and diallyl disulfide, linalool, citronellal, caryophyllene oxide etc. in AsB + CpL combination.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Therefore, the said mixtures of the plant essential oils and or mixtures of the constituent compounds can be used as effective control agents for the control of the filarial vector, <i>C. quinquefasciatus</i>."

      "<h4>Background</h4>Elaeagnus umbellata Thunb. (autumn olive) is a high valued medicinal plant. It belongs to Elaeagnaceae family and is widely distributed in Himalayan regions of Pakistan. In the present study essential oil were extracted from the fruit of this plant and their antioxidant, anticholinesterase and antidiabetic potentials were also evaluated.<h4>Methods</h4>Essential oils were extracted from the fruit of E. umbellata using hydro-distillation method and were characterized by GC-MS. The extracted oil were tested for its antioxidant, anticholinesterase, and antidiabetic potentials using standard protocols.<h4>Results</h4>About 68 compounds were identified by GC-MS. The extracted oil exhibited a fairly high free radical scavenging activities against DPPH and ABTS radicals with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 70 and 105 μg/mL respectively (for ascorbic acid, used as standard, the IC<sub>50</sub> values were 32 and 29 μg/mL, respectively against the mentioned radicals). The essential oil also exhibited anticholinesterase activities with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 48 and 90 μg/mL respectively against AChE and BChE (for galantamine used as standard, the IC<sub>50</sub> values were 25 and 30 μg/mL respectively). The essential oil also exhibited antidiabetic potential with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 120 and 110 μg/mL respectively against α-glucosidase and α-amylase (IC<sub>50</sub> values for standard acarbose = 28 and 30 μg/mL respectively).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Essential oil extracted from the fruits of E. umbellata exhibited reasonable antioxidant, anticholinesterase, and antidiabetic potentials that could be used as alternative medicine in treating diabetes and neurodegenerative disorders. However, further studies are needed to isolate responsible compounds and evaluate the observed potential in animal models."

      "The antioxidant, cytoprotective, and wound-healing potential of the essential oil from the resin of <i>Pistacia lentiscus</i> var. <i>chia</i> (mastic oil) was evaluated, along with that of its major components, myrcene and <i>α</i>-pinene. Antioxidant potential was monitored as: (i) direct antioxidant activity as assessed by 2,2-di-phenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), and ABTS assays; (ii) DNA damage protection activity; and (iii) cytoprotective activity as assessed via induction of transcription of genes related to the antioxidant response in human keratinocyte cells (HaCaT). The cytoprotective potential of the test substances was further evaluated against ultraviolet radiation B (UVB)- or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative damage, whereas their regenerative capability was accessed by monitoring the wound closure rate in HaCaT. Μastic oil and major components did not show significant direct antioxidant activity, however they increased the mRNA levels of antioxidant response genes, suggesting indirect antioxidant activity. Treatment of HaCaT with the test substances before and after UVB irradiation resulted in increased cell viability in the cases of pre-treatment with mastic oil or post-treatment with myrcene. Increased cytoprotection was also observed in the case of cell treatment with mastic oil or its major components prior to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> exposure. Finally, mastic oil and myrcene demonstrated a favorable dose-dependent effect for cell migration and wound closure. Collectively, mastic essential oil may exert its promising cytoprotective properties through indirect antioxidant mechanisms."

      "During preservation, Jerusalem artichoke (JA) tubers are subjected to deterioration by mold fungi under storage, which signifies a serious problem. A new blue mold (<i>Penicillium polonium</i>) was recorded for the first time on JA tubers. Penicillium mold was isolated, identified (morphologically, and molecularly), and deposited in GenBank; (MW041259). The fungus has a multi-lytic capacity, facilitated by various enzymes capable of severely destroying the tuber components. An economic oil-based procedure was applied for preserving and retaining the nutritive value of JA tubers under storage conditions. Caraway and clove essential oils, at a concentration of 2%, were selected based on their strong antifungal actions. JA tubers were treated with individual oils under storage, kept between peat moss layers, and stored at room temperature. Tubers treated with both oils exhibited lower blue mold severity, sprouting and weight loss, and higher levels of carbohydrates, inulin, and protein contents accompanied by increased levels of defense-related phytochemicals (total phenols, peroxidase, and polyphenol oxidase). Caraway was superior, but the results endorse the use of both essential oils for the preservation of JA tubers at room temperature, as an economic and eco-safe storage technique against the new blue mold."

      "<h4>Background</h4><i>Myrtus communis</i> (<i>M. communis</i>) is a wild aromatic plant used for traditional herbal medicine that can be demonstrated in insecticidal, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial activity of its essential oils (MCEO).<h4>Aim</h4>The present study aimed to evaluate the prophylactic effects of <i>M. communis</i> essential oil (MCEO) against chronic toxoplasmosis induced by the Tehran strain of <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> in mice.<h4>Methods</h4>Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis was performed to determine the chemical composition of MCEO. Mice were then orally administrated with MCEO at the doses of 100, 200, and 300 mg/kg/day and also atovaquone 100 mg/kg for 21 days. On the 15th day, the mice were infected with the intraperitoneal inoculation of 20-25 tissue cysts from the Tehran strain of <i>T. gondii</i>. The mean numbers of brain tissue cysts and the mRNA levels of IL-12 and IFN-γ in mice of each tested group were measured.<h4>Results</h4>By GC/MS, the major constituents were α-pinene (24.7%), 1,8-cineole (19.6%), and linalool (12.6%), respectively. The results demonstrated that the mean number of <i>T. gondii</i> tissue cysts in experimental groups Ex1 (<i>p</i> < 0.05), Ex2 (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and Ex3 (<i>p</i> < 0.001) was meaningfully reduced in a dose-dependent manner compared with the control group (C2). The mean diameter of tissue cyst was significantly reduced in mice of the experimental groups Ex2 (<i>p</i> < 0.01) and Ex3 (<i>p</i> < 0.001). The results demonstrated that although the mRNA levels of IFN-γ and IL-12 were elevated in all mice of experimental groups, a significant increase (<i>p</i> < 0.001) was observed in tested groups of Ex2 and Ex3 when compared with control groups.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The findings of the present study demonstrated the potent prophylactic effects of MCEO especially in the doses 200 and 300 mg/kg in mice infected with <i>T. gondii</i>. Although the exceptional anti-<i>Toxoplasma</i> effects of MCEO and other possessions, such as improved innate immunity and low toxicity are positive topics, there is, however, a need for more proof from investigations in this field."

      "<i>Ximenia americana</i> is one of the most valuable wild edible plants in the world. In different countries, it is utilized as food, medicine, an essential oil source, and the industrial component to other products. In Ethiopia, it was one of the most known and very important plants for a long period of time. It was utilized as food, a medicinal plant, and animal feed. It was also one of the most economically important and culturally valuable plants. But nowadays, it is not adequately available in the country due to deforestation problem in the years. In addition, its economic importance, current status, and medicinal roles are not well documented and understood. As for research studies, it is concluded that unless a collective effort is taken, the existence of this plant is under severe threat and needs to have some measures. This review article is aimed at addressing the abovelined topics in detail and to pinpoint and explain the importance and status of <i>Ximenia americana</i>."

      "The biological synthesis of nanoparticles, due to their environmental and biomedical properties, has been of particular interest to scientists and physicians. Here, iron nanoparticles (FeNPs) were synthesized using <i>Satureja hortensis</i> essential oil. Then, the chemical, functional, and morphological properties of these nanoparticles were characterized by typical experiments such as Uv-Vis, FTIR, XRD, FE-SEM, PSA, zeta potential, EDX, and EDX mapping. The results indicated Fe nanoparticles' formation with a cubic morphological structure and a particle size in the range of 9.3-27 nm. The antimicrobial effects of these nanoparticles were further evaluated using disc diffusion, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), and minimum fungal concentration (MFC) against two gram-positive bacterial strains (<i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> and <i>Corynebacterium glutamicum</i>), two gram-negative bacterial strains (<i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and <i>Escherichia coli</i>), and one fungus species <i>Candida albicans</i>. The results showed that green-synthesized Fe nanoparticles possessed higher antimicrobial properties than Satureja hortensis essential oil against selected pathogenic microorganisms, especially Gram-negative bacteria. Finally, the anticancer effect of these Fe nanoparticles was investigated on human cancer cells, K-562, and MCF-7, by the MTT assay. The results showed the anticancer effect of these nanoparticles against selected cell lines."

      "This work is a summary of the characterization, activities, and ethnobotanical surveys about aromatic and medicinal plants belonging to the genus Mentha in Morocco. The Mentha species investigated are <i>Mentha pulegium, Mentha spicata</i>, <i>Mentha viridis</i>, <i>Mentha suaveolens</i>, <i>Mentha longifolia</i>, <i>Mentha gattefossei</i>, <i>Mentha rotundifolia</i>, and <i>Mentha vulgare</i>, with <i>M. pulegium</i> being the most studied species. <i>M. spicata</i> and <i>M. viridis</i> are poorly explored even though they are daily consumed by Moroccans in tea infusions. The elucidated factors affecting the composition of Mentha essential oils are fertilization, drying conditions, mechanical impedance, NaCl stress, and Gamma irradiation. Investigation of the activities of the Mentha species showed that the main interest was dedicated to addressing the antibacterial effect towards gram+ and gram- bacteria. Essential oils of Mentha species exhibited antifungal, antiviral, antioxidant, insecticidal, licidal, niticidal, allelopathic, antidiabetic, derma-protective, and anticorrosive activities. The ethnobotanical surveys revealed that Mentha species are used in seven regions: Tafilalet, High Atlas, Fez-Boulemane, Taounat, Oujda, Ouazzane, and Rabat. By calculating the Jaccard index, the highest degree of similarity was found between Tafilalet, Rabat, and Oujda regions. The wide use of the Mentha species in Morocco highlights the high ethnobotanical value of the genus."

      "<i>Curcuma longa</i> L. rhizome essential oil is a valuable product in pharmaceutical industry due to its wide beneficial health effects. Novel applications in the agri-food industry where more sustainable extraction processes are required currently and safer substances are claimed for the consumer are being investigated. This review provides information regarding the conventional and recent extraction methods of <i>C. longa</i> rhizome oil, their characteristics and suitability to be applied at the industrial scale. In addition, variations in the chemical composition of <i>C. longa</i> rhizome and leaf essential oils regarding intrinsic and extrinsic factors and extraction methods are also analysed in order to select the most proper to obtain the most efficient activity. Finally, the potential applications of <i>C. longa</i> rhizome oil in the agri-food industry, such as antimicrobial, weedicide and a food preservative agent, are included. Regarding the data, <i>C. longa</i> rhizome essential oil may play a special role in the agri-food industry; however, further research to determine the application threshold so as not to damage crops or affect the organoleptic properties of food products, as well as efficient encapsulation techniques, are necessary for its implementation in global agriculture."

      "The floral fragrance of plants is an important indicator in their evaluation. The aroma of sweet cherry flowers is mainly derived from their essential oil. In this study, based on the results of a single-factor experiment, a Box-Behnken design was adopted for ultrasound- and microwave-assisted extraction of essential oil from sweet cherry flowers of the Brooks cultivar. With the objective of extracting the maximum essential oil yield (w/w), the optimal extraction process conditions were a liquid-solid ratio of 52 mL g<sup>-1</sup>, an extraction time of 27 min, and a microwave power of 435 W. The essential oil yield was 1.23%, which was close to the theoretical prediction. The volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of the sweet cherry flowers of four cultivars (Brooks, Black Pearl, Tieton and Summit) were identified via headspace solid phase microextraction (SPME) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results showed that a total of 155 VOCs were identified and classified in the essential oil from sweet cherry flowers of four cultivars, 65 of which were shared among the cultivars. The highest contents of VOCs were aldehydes, alcohols, ketones and esters. Ethanol, linalool, lilac alcohol, acetaldehyde, (E)-2-hexenal, benzaldehyde and dimethyl sulfide were the major volatiles, which were mainly responsible for the characteristic aroma of sweet cherry flowers. It was concluded that the VOCs of sweet cherry flowers were qualitatively similar; however, relative content differences were observed in the four cultivars. This study provides a theoretical basis for the metabolism and regulation of the VOCs of sweet cherry flowers."

      "Edible vegetable oils can provide most of the fatty acids, vitamin E, and certain phytochemicals necessary in the daily human diet to facilitate the required physiological activities. However, there are many types of edible vegetable oils on the market, and evaluating their nutritional quality is a matter of significant interest to consumers and producers. Most of the existing research studies that comparatively analyze and qualitatively describe the type, content, and proportion of nutrients in edible vegetable oil lack a comprehensive method for evaluating the nutritional quality of edible vegetable oil. Based on the physical and chemical analysis of fatty acids, vitamins, and phytochemicals in edible vegetable oil, this study aims to establish a model for a comprehensive evaluation of the nutritional quality of edible vegetable oils. The characteristic nutrients in edible vegetable oil were screened as the evaluation index, while the 2013 China Dietary Reference Intake and French Population Reference Intakes For Fatty Acids was considered the evaluation threshold. When each evaluation index in the edible vegetable oil reached the range stipulated by the reference intake of dietary nutrients, the index will get 1 point. The total score of each index was accumulated to evaluate the nutritional quality of the edible vegetable oils comprehensively. In this study, 13 edible vegetable oils, including low erucic acid rapeseed oil (in America, people usually call it canola oil), soybean oil, peanut oil, sunflower seed oil, flaxseed oil, edible blend oil, olive oil, palm oil, corn oil, camellia oil, peony seed oil, sacha inchi oil, and sesame oil, were selected as the evaluation objects because they are very common in China. Seven evaluation indexes were found for total saturated fatty acids (SFAs), atherogenic fatty acids (SFAs with 12, 14, and 16 carbon chains), monounsaturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids like linoleic acid and α-linolenic acid, vitamin E, and phytosterol. When the evaluation index met the evaluation threshold, it was scored 1 point. Scores ranged from 2 to 6. The highest scores were obtained from peony seed oil, flaxseed oil, low erucic acid rapeseed oil, and edible blend oil all of which were 6 points. The lowest score belonged to palm oil at 2 points. The higher the score, the higher the degree of satisfaction between the various nutrients in the edible vegetable oil and the dietary reference intake of this model is. This paper establishes a new method for the nutritional evaluation of edible vegetable oils, which is convenient for comparing the overall nutritional quality of different kinds of edible vegetable oils while providing a new technique for the extensive evaluation of edible vegetable oil."

      "Arabian flora is a rich source of bioactive compounds. In this study, we investigated three aromatic plant species with the aim of finding valuable sources of antimicrobial agents against common pathogenic microorganisms. We focused especially on microorganisms, which cause outbreaks of infectious disease during mass gatherings and pilgrimages season in Saudi Arabia. The essential oils of three aromatic plant species were hydrodistilled from flowering aerial parts of <i>Lavandula pubescens</i> Decne. and <i>Pulicaria incisa</i> subsp. <i>candolleana</i> E.Gamal-Eldin, and from leaves, stems, ripe and unripe fruits of <i>Juniperus procera</i> Hochst. Ex Endl. They were subsequently analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The main constituents of <i>L. pubescens</i> were found to be carvacrol (55.7%), methyl carvacrol (13.4%), and β-bisabolene (9.1%). <i>P. incisa</i> subsp. <i>Candolleana</i> essential oil was rich in linalool (33.0%), chrysanthenone (10.3%), eugenol (8.9%), and <i>cis</i>-chrysanthenol (8.0%); the major components of <i>J. procera</i> essential oil were α-pinene (31.3-62.5%) and δ-3-carene (7.3-30.3%). These essential oils were tested against thirteen American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria using the agar diffusion assay. The only effective essential oil was that of <i>L. pubescens</i> and the most sensitive strains were <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>, <i>Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella sonnei</i>, <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> and <i>Staphylococcus epidermidis</i>. Carvacrol, the major constituent of <i>L. pubescens</i>, was tested on these strains and was compared with vancomycin, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) assays of <i>L. pubescens</i> essential oil and carvacrol revealed that Gram-negative strains were more susceptible than the Gram-positive ones."

      "The majority of essential oils obtained from vascular plants have been demonstrated to be effective in treating fungal and bacterial infections. Among others, Salvia hydrangea is an endemic half-shrub belonging to the Lamiaceae family that has been widely used from ancient times in Iranian traditional medicine. The aim of this study was to compare the composition and antimicrobial properties of essential oils obtained from leaves or flowers of this plant, collected from the Daran region of Iran during June 2018. The oils were obtained using Clevenger apparatus, their composition was evaluated by means of gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and the antimicrobial properties were assayed by measuring inhibition halos, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). The yield of leaf oil was ~ 0.25% and that of flower oil was ~ 0.28%. Oil composition was affected by the part of the plants used: the most abundant bioactives contained in leaf essential oil were (+)-spathulenol (16.07%), 1,8-cineole (13.96%), trans-caryophyllene (9.58%), β-pinene (8.91%) and β-eudesmol (5.33%) and those in flower essential oil were caryophyllene oxide (35.47%), 1,8-cineole (9.54%), trans-caryophyllene (6.36%), β-eudesmol (4.11%), caryophyllenol-II (3.46%) and camphor (3.33%). Both the oils showed a significant inhibitory and lethal effect on the Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC ~ 16 µg/mL), Shigella dysenteriae and Klebsiella pneumoniae (MIC ~ 62 µg/mL). Therefore, the essential oils obtained from both leaves and flowers of S. hydrangea may have potential application as bactericidal agents against some bacteria."

Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the activity of various extracts from differential parts of Z. rhetsa via inhibition of inflammatory mediators (NO, TNF-α, and PGE2) in RAW264.7 macrophages. The chemical composition in active extracts was also analyzed by GC/MS. The parts of this plant studied were whole fruits (F), pericarp (P), and seed (O). The methods of extraction included maceration in hexane, 95% ethanol and 50% ethanol, boiling in water, and water distillation. The results demonstrated that the hexane and 95% ethanolic extract from pericarp (PH and P95) and seed essential oil (SO) were the most active extracts. PH and P95 gave the highest inhibition of NO production with IC50 as 11.99 ± 1.66 μg/ml and 15.33 ± 1.05 μg/ml, respectively, and they also showed the highest anti-inflammatory effect on TNF-α with IC50 as 36.08 ± 0.55 μg/ml and 34.90 ± 2.58 μg/ml, respectively. PH and P95 also showed the highest inhibitory effect on PGE2 but less than SO with IC50 as 13.72 ± 0.81 μg/ml, 12.26 ± 0.71 μg/ml, and 8.61 ± 2.23 μg/ml, respectively. 2,3-Pinanediol was the major anti-inflammatory compound analyzed in PH (11.28%) and P95 (19.82%) while terpinen-4-ol constituted a major anti-inflammatory compound in SO at 35.13%. These findings are the first supportive data for ethnomedical use for analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity in acute (SO) and chronic (PH and P95) inflammation."

      "Turmeric (<i>Curcuma longa</i> L.) is an important spice, particularly is Asian cuisine, and is also used in traditional herbal medicine. Curcuminoids are the main bioactive agents in turmeric, but turmeric essential oils also contain health benefits. Turmeric is a tropical crop and is cultivated in warm humid environments worldwide. The southeastern United States also possesses a warm humid climate with a growing demand for locally sourced herbs and spices. In this study, five different varieties of <i>C. longa</i> were cultivated in north Alabama, the rhizome essential oils obtained by hydrodistillation, and the essential oils were analyzed by gas chromatographic techniques. The major components in the essential oils were α-phellandrene (3.7-11.8%), 1,8-cineole (2.6-11.7%), α-zingiberene (0.8-12.5%), β-sesquiphellandrene (0.7-8.0%), <i>ar</i>-turmerone (6.8-32.5%), α-turmerone (13.6-31.5%), and β-turmerone (4.8-18.4%). The essential oil yields and chemical profiles of several of the varieties are comparable with those from tropical regions, suggesting that these should be considered for cultivation and commercialization in the southeastern United States."

      "Industrial hemp is a multiuse crop that has been widely cultivated to produce fibers and nutrients. The capability of the essential oil (EO) from inflorescences as antimicrobial agent has been reported. However, literature data are still lacking about the hemp EO antiprotozoal efficacy in vivo. The present study aims to unravel this concern through the evaluation of the efficacy of hemp EOs (2.5 mL/kg, intraperitoneally) of three different cultivars, namely <i>Futura 75</i>, <i>Carmagnola selezionata</i> and <i>Eletta campana</i>, in mice intraperitoneally infected with <i>Leishmania tropica</i>. A detailed description of EO composition and targets-components analysis is reported. Myrcene, α-pinene and <i>E</i>-caryophyllene were the main components of the EOs, as indicated by the gas-chromatographic analysis. However, a prominent position in the scenario of the theoretical interactions underlying the bio-pharmacological activity was also occupied by selina-3,7(11)-diene, which displayed affinities in the micromolar range (5.4-28.9) towards proliferator-activated receptor α, cannabinoid CB2 receptor and acetylcholinesterase. The content of this compound was higher in <i>Futura 75</i> and <i>Eletta campana</i>, in accordance with their higher scavenging/reducing properties and efficacy against the tissue wound, induced by <i>L. tropica</i>. Overall, the present study recommends hemp female inflorescences, as sources of biomolecules with potential pharmacological applications, especially towards infective diseases."

      "Turmeric is a known spice indispensable for food preparation and is reported to possess different chemical properties and biological activities. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of variety and type of extracts on 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) reducing capacity, antibacterial activity, and chemical composition of essential oil from turmeric varieties cultivated in Ethiopia. The results from the statistical analysis revealed that the highest total curcuminoids content (6.81% m/m), essential oil (6.37% v/m), methanol extract (13.42% v/m) were obtained from Dame variety. On the other hand, the lowest curcuminoids (5.12% m/m), methanol extract (10.58% v/m) and essential oil (3.92% v/m) contents were obtained from HT3/2002 variety. Dame variety also had the highest total polyphenol content (97.55 mg GAE/g) and radical scavenging capacity (46.58 16 μg/mL) with the lowest IC<sub>50</sub> value (23.05 μg/mL). Among the tested microorganisms with turmeric extracts, growth inhibition was observed against <i>S. aureus</i>. The results also indicated that three compounds, namely α-Turmerone (32.41 and 35.16%), ar-Turmerone (25.20 and 25.47%), and Curlone (17.98 and 18.19%) dominated 75% of the essential oil component in Dame and Bonga 51/71 varieties, respectively. In summary, the results of this study revealed that extracts from Dame variety have strong biological potential with desired antioxidant and antibacterial activities."

      "At present, organic crops have reached an important boom in a society increasingly interested in the conservation of the environment and sustainability. It is evident that a part of the population in the Western world focuses their concern on how to obtain our food and on doing it in a way that is as respectful as possible with the environment. In this review, we present a compilation of the work carried out with the use of essential oils as an alternative in the fight against different bacteria and fungi that attack crops and related products. Given the collected works, the efficacy of essential oils for their use as pesticides for agricultural use is evident."

      "The genus <i>Cedrela</i> P. Browne, which belongs to the Meliaceae family, has eighteen species. Trees of this genus are of economic interest due to wood quality, as well as being the focus of studies because of relevant biologic activities as in other Meliaceae species. These activities are mainly related to limonoids, a characteristic class of compounds in this family. Therefore, the aim of this review is to perform a survey of the citations in the literature on the <i>Cedrela</i> genus species. Articles were found on quantitative and qualitative phytochemical studies of the <i>Cedrela</i> species, revealing the chemical compounds identified, such as aliphatics acid and alcohol, flavonoids, tocopherol, monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, triterpenes, cycloartanes, steroids, and limonoids. Although some activities were tested, the majority of studies focused on the insecticidal, antifeedant, or insect growth inhibitor activities of this genus. Nonetheless, the most promising activities were related to their antimalarial and antitripanocidal effects, although further investigations are still needed."

      "The purpose of the research was to examine the protective effect of essential oil from <i>Thymus serrulatus</i> Hochst. ex Benth. (TSA oil) against cadmium (Cd)-induced renal toxicity. The experimental protocol was designed using 30 healthy adult Wistar albino rats allocated into five groups containing six animals in each group. Group 1 was treated as normal control and groups 2, 3, 4, and 5 were treated with cadmium chloride (CdCl<sub>2</sub>, 3 mg/kg, IP) for 7 days. Group 3 was also treated with silymarin (100 mg/kg, PO) as a standard group, while groups 4 and 5 were administered with TSA oil at doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg PO, respectively. The nephrotoxicity was measured with various parameters such as kidney function markers, oxidative stress markers (glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA)), and messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression levels of inflammatory factors. The histological studies were also evaluated in the experimental protocol. The CdCl<sub>2</sub>-treated groups showed a significant increase in the levels of serum kidney function markers along with MDA levels in kidney homogenate. However, renal GSH level was found to be reduced significantly. It was found that CdCl<sub>2</sub> significantly upregulated the nuclear factor levels of kappaB (NF-κB p65), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and small mothers against decapentaplegic (Smad2) as compared to the normal control group. On the other hand, TSA oil significantly improved the increased levels of serum kidney function markers, non-enzymatic antioxidants, and lipid peroxidation. In addition, TSA oil significantly downregulated the increased expression of NF-κB p65, iNOS, and Smad2 in Cd-intoxicated rats. Moreover, the histological changes in the tissue samples of the kidney of Cd-treated groups were significantly ameliorated in the silymarin- and TSA-oil-treated groups. The present study reveals that TSA oil ameliorates Cd-induced renal injury, and it is also proposed that the observed nephroprotective effect could be due to the antioxidant potential of TSA oil and healing due to its anti-inflammatory action."

      "Essential oils are highly demanded substances worldwide. They can be used without modification due to their different chemical and biological properties or as natural sources of chemical compounds. The limit in the use of these metabolites is their low yield. In the present investigation, the essential oil of fruits from <i>Dacryodes peruviana</i> collected in the Ecuadorian Amazon was extracted and studied. The essential oil was released from the plant matrix and isolated by hydrodistillation. The yields obtained were 4.8 ± 0.2% and 11.3 ± 0.2% for fresh and dried fruits, respectively, one of the highest yields on record to date. Twenty-five chemical compounds were identified by GC/MS and GC/FID techniques. The principal constituent was α-phellandrene, with 50.32 ± 3.32%. The antimicrobial activity of the oil was assayed against five Gram negative bacteria, two Gram positive bacteria and two fungi. The essential oil exerted a moderate activity against <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. The repellent activity of the oil was assayed against mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae); the samples with 3%, 2% and 1% essential oil were class 4, and the sample with 0.5% showed to be class 3. The essential oil showed a weak antioxidant activity through the DPPH and ABTS methods."

      "The purpose of the study was to determine the chemical composition and antibacterial activity of <i>Lippia multiflora</i> Moldenke essential oils (EOs) collected in different regions of Angola. Antibacterial activity was evaluated using the agar wells technique and vapour phase test. Analysis of the oils by GC/MS identified thirty-five components representing 67.5 to 100% of the total oils. Monoterpene hydrocarbons were the most prevalent compounds, followed by oxygenated monoterpenes. The content of the compounds varied according to the samples. The main components were Limonene, Piperitenone, Neral, Citral, Elemol, p-cymene, Transtagetone, and Artemisia ketone. Only one of the eleven samples contained Verbenone as the majority compound. In the vapour phase test, a single oil was the most effective against all the pathogens studied. The principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) of components of the selected EOs and inhibition zone diameter values of agar wells technique allowed us to identify a variability between the plants from the two provinces, but also intraspecific variability between sub-groups within a population. Each group of essential oils constituted a chemotype responsible for their bacterial inhibition capacity. The results presented here suggest that Angolan <i>Lippia multiflora</i> Moldenke has antibacterial properties and could be a potential source of antimicrobial agents for the pharmaceutical and food industry."

      "<i>Moringa oleifera</i> belongs to the Moringaceae family and is the best known of the native <i>Moringa oleifera</i> genus. For centuries, it has been used as a system of Ayurvedic and Unani medicine and has a wide range of nutritional and bioactive compounds, including proteins, essential amino acids, carbohydrates, lipids, fibre, vitamins, minerals, phenolic compounds, phytosterols and others. These characteristics allow it to have pharmacological properties, including anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, anticarcinogenic, antioxidant, cardioprotective, antimicrobial and hepatoprotective properties. The entire <i>Moringa oleifera</i> plant is edible, including its flowers, however, it is not entirely safe, because of compounds that have been found mainly in the root and bark, so the leaf was identified as the safest. <i>Moringa oleifera</i> is recognised as an excellent source of phytochemicals, with potential applications in functional and medicinal food preparations due to its nutritional and medicinal properties; many authors have experimented with incorporating it mainly in biscuits, cakes, brownies, meats, juices and sandwiches. The results are fascinating, as the products increase their nutritional value; however, the concentrations cannot be high, as this affects the organoleptic characteristics of the supplemented products. The aim of this study is to review the application of <i>Moringa oleifera</i> in bakery products, which will allow the creation of new products that improve their nutritional and functional value."

      "The purpose of the study was to determine the differences between two subspecies: <i>O</i>. <i>vulgare</i> L. subsp. <i>hirtum</i> (Link) Ietswaart (Greek oregano) and <i>O</i>. <i>vulgare</i> L. subsp. <i>vulgare</i> (common oregano) growing in cultivation conditions within temperate climate of Central Europe. The characteristic of the subspecies was undertaken in terms of selected morphological parameters and the quality of the raw material. The herb of both subspecies was evaluated on the content and composition of essential oil by hydrodistillation followed by GC-MS and GC-FID (gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry and flame ionization detector), the total content of phenolic acids (according to PP 6th ed.) and the content of rosmarinic acid (by HPLC). The sensory evaluation (QDA) was performed, as well. Greek oregano was distinguished by visibly higher number of glandular trichomes on the leaves (up to 4.85 per 1 mm<sup>2</sup>) followed by higher content of essential oil in the herb (up to 3.36 g × 100 g<sup>-1</sup> DW) in comparison to common oregano. Based on the essential oil composition, Greek oregano was classified as mixed carvacrol/γ-terpinene chemotype, while common oregano as mixed sabinyl/cymyl type rich in sesquiterpenes. Greek oregano was also characterized by higher total content of phenolic acids (up to 6.16 g × 100 g<sup>-1</sup> DW) and rosmarinic acid (up to 6787.2 mg × 100 g<sup>-1</sup> DW) than common oregano. Essential oil content reached the maximum at the beginning of blooming (common oregano) and at the full blooming stage (Greek oregano). In turn, the amount of phenolic acids followed by rosmarinic acid was the highest at the beginning of seed-setting stage, in the case of both subspecies. The differences between subspecies concerning chemical composition (especially essential oil) were reflected in the sensory attributes, where both odor and taste notes were found at higher level for Greek oregano. Results of our work indicate that Greek oregano is well adapted to grow in the temperate zone conditions. Such adaptation was reflected mainly in the satisfied yield and maintaining characters typical for the Mediterranean plant, e.g., a high essential oil content followed by high carvacrol share, traits the most important from practice viewpoint."

      "Medicinal plants and their derived compounds have drawn the attention of researchers due to their considerable impact on human health. Among medicinal plants, mint (<i>Mentha</i> species) exhibits multiple health beneficial properties, such as prevention from cancer development and anti-obesity, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, and cardioprotective effects, as a result of its antioxidant potential, combined with low toxicity and high efficacy. <i>Mentha</i> species are widely used in savory dishes, food, beverages, and confectionary products. Phytochemicals derived from mint also showed anticancer activity against different types of human cancers such as cervix, lung, breast and many others. Mint essential oils show a great cytotoxicity potential, by modulating MAPK and PI3k/Akt pathways; they also induce apoptosis, suppress invasion and migration potential of cancer cells lines along with cell cycle arrest, upregulation of Bax and p53 genes, modulation of TNF, IL-6, IFN-γ, IL-8, and induction of senescence phenotype. Essential oils from mint have also been found to exert antibacterial activities against <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, <i>Streptococcus aureus</i>, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, and many others. The current review highlights the antimicrobial role of mint-derived compounds and essential oils with a special emphasis on anticancer activities, clinical data and adverse effects displayed by such versatile plants."

      "Natural compounds obtained from different medicinal and aromatic plants have gained respect as alternative treatments to synthetic drugs, as well as raw materials for different applications (cosmetic, food and feed industries, environment protection, and many others). Based on a literature survey on dedicated databases, the aim of the present work is to be a critical discussion of aspects regarding classical extraction versus modern extraction techniques; possibilities to scale up (advantages and disadvantages of different extraction methods usually applied and the influence of extraction parameters); and different medicinal and aromatic plants' different applications (medical and industrial applications, as well as the potential use in nanotechnology). As nowadays, research studies are directed toward the development of modern, innovative applications of the medicinal and aromatic plants, aspects regarding future perspectives are also discussed."

      "<h4>Background</h4>Plants are the repository of variable number of valuable secondary metabolites that bears pharmacognostic and pharmacological implications having potentiality to emerge as super drugs in future. In-vivo production of these metabolites is influenced by the biotic and abiotic stresses resulting in continuous accumulation of diverse phytochemicals and their derivatives that can be useful in designing and developing potential drugs for future. The aim of the present study is to review the existence of medicinally important secondary metabolites and possible pharmacological and pharmacognostic importance of under-explored weed plant species <i>Hyptis suaveolens</i> (L.) Poit., to explore the potentiality of the plant for developing and designing the drugs for future.<h4>Main body of the abstract</h4><i>Hyptis suaveolens</i> belonging to family Lamiaceae is the rich source of medicinally important phytochemicals like essential oils, tannins, saponins, phenols, flavonoids, terpenoids, alkaloids, and sterols. One or many of these compounds have antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic, anti-septic, anti-cancer, anti-ulcer, antimicrobial, antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, anti-diabetic, anti-fertility, diaphoretics, anticutaneous, anticatarrhal, antirheumatic, anti-ulcer, gastroprotective, immunomodulatory, analgesic, and antiviral activity.<h4>Short conclusion</h4><i>Hyptis suaveolens</i> contains unique terpenoid metabolites like suaveolic acid, suaveolol, methyl suaveolate, beta-sitosterol, ursolic acid, and phenolic compound like rosamarinic acid, methyl rosamarinate that have potentiality to substitute the traditional drugs as therapeutic agent against the resistant and newly emerged bacterial and viral pathogens. Pentacyclic triterpenoid, ursolic acid have been reported to have effective antiviral response against the SARS-CoV2 responsible for the present COVID-19 pandemic and HIV virus for which no effective vaccines are available till date. Ursolic acid has the ability to modulate the activity of main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>) that is essential for processing of SARS-CoV2 replicase-transcriptase machinery needed for viral replication and particle assembly."

      "<i>Thymus</i> (Lamiaceae) is famous for its pharmacological properties. <i>Thymus daenensis</i> Celak (Avishan-e-denaee in Persian) is an endemic <i>Thymus</i> species in Iran and is traditionally used for its digestive, carminative, antitussive, antispasmodic, and expectorant attributes in folk medicine. Ecotypic oils were extracted and analyzed with the GC-MS. Their biological properties in terms of antimicrobial, antioxidant, and antigenotoxic activities were evaluated using the minimal inhibitory concentration, minimal bactericidal concentration, and DPPH, <i>β</i>-carotene, and comet assays. The GC-MS results for <i>Thymus daenensis</i> Celak oils revealed thymol (73.86%) and carvacrol (51.89%) as the most abundant components. Due to the results, reasonable bactericidal activity values range from 0.14 to 5.00 mg/ml, and fungicidal activity ranges from 0.17 to 0.58 mg/ml. The necessary oil free radical scavenging capacity (0.41-1.79 mg/ml), bleaching inhibitory activity (0.01-1.06 mg/ml), and genoprotective potential (1.04-7.78 mg/ml) indicated the dose-dependent activity. The results suggest that <i>Thymus daenensis</i> is an important antibacterial and antifungal bioresource. Additionally, the antioxidant and radical scavenging capacity suggests this species has a role as a natural preservative in oxidative diseases and in the prevention of food spoilage."

      "The aim of the present research was to determine the chemical composition and the cytotoxic effects of <i>Tetraclinis articulata</i> trunk bark essential oil (HEE) obtained by steam distillation and five fractions obtained by normal phase silica chromatographic separation. Chemical analysis allowed the identification of 54 known compounds. Relatively high amounts of oxygenated sesquiterpenes (44.4-70.2%) were detected, mainly consisting of caryophyllene oxide (13.1-26.6%), carotol (9.2-21.2%),14-hydroxy-9-<i>epi</i>-(<i>E</i>)-caryophyllene (3.2-15.5%) and humulene epoxide II (2.6-7.2%). The cytotoxic activity against human mammary carcinoma cell lines (MDA-MB-231) and colorectal carcinoma cell lines (SW620) of the essential oil and its fractions were assessed. All the samples displayed moderate to weak activity compared to 5-fluorouracil. The colorectal carcinoma cell line was relatively more sensitive to the essential oil and its fractions compared to the breast cancer cell line, showing IC<sub>50</sub> values from 25.7 to 96.5 μg/mL. In addition, the essential oil and its fraction E.2 revealed a cytotoxic activity against colorectal carcinoma cell line, with IC<sub>50</sub> values lower than 30 μg/mL. This is the first report on the chemical composition and cytotoxic activity of the trunk bark essential oil of <i>T. articulata</i>."

      "<h4>Background and aim</h4><i>Bacillus</i> species are widely distributed microorganisms in nature that are responsible for outbreaks of food poisoning and a common cause of food spoilage. This study aimed to isolate and identify foodborne <i>Bacillus</i> species from meat and to determine the antimicrobial activities of commercial essential oils and spices powder extracted from certain medicinal plants.<h4>Methods</h4>Sixty meat samples were collected in Assiut city and subdivided into raw meat and processed meat. <i>Bacillus</i> spp were isolated and identified according to their cultural characters, biochemical reactions, serological typing, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The antibacterial activity of essential oils and spices powder was measured by using well-diffusion and microbial count techniques.<h4>Results</h4>The prevalence of <i>Bacillus</i> spp. in the examined raw meat samples and processed meat samples was 13.34%, and 26.67%, respectively. There was a marked decrease in the total <i>Bacillus</i> species count after treatment of minced beef with essential oils and spices powder compared to the untreated one. Black seed oil was the most potent antibacterial essential oil among the tested oils present in this study.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Essential oils and spices powder of certain medicinal plants (cumin: <i>Cuminum cyminum</i>, black seeds: <i>Nigella sativa</i>, cloves: <i>Syzygium aromaicum</i>, cinnamon: <i>Cinnamomum zeylanicum</i>, and Marjoram: <i>Origanum majorana</i>) have a potential in vitro antimicrobial activity against <i>Bacillus</i> spp. Furthermore, <i>Nigella sativa</i> oil exhibited the most potent antibacterial activity against <i>Bacillus</i> spp."

      "The essential oil (EO) and hydrosol (HL) isolated from <i>Cuminum cyminum</i> (cumin) seeds were evaluated against the root-knot nematodes <i>Meloidogyne incognita</i> and <i>M. javanica</i>. The efficacy of extracts on the motility, hatching, and survival in soil of second-stage juveniles (J2s), and the activity on egg differentiation were tested. All J2s were paralyzed after immersion in the EO at 62.5 μL/L concentration for 96 h. Encouraging results were recorded using HL equal to or higher than 10% concentration for both <i>Meloidogyne</i> species tested. More than 70% paralyzed J2s were recorded after immersion for 48 h, while the percentage was increased to higher than 90% after 96 h of immersion. A clear effect on egg differentiation was observed after immersion in EO or HL. A significant decrease in egg differentiation was revealed at even low concentrations of EO while an evident decrease in egg differentiation was recorded after immersion of eggs in 50% HL dilution. Decreased hatching of <i>M. incognita</i> and <i>M. javanica</i> J2s was observed with the increase in concentration. The lowest numbers of hatched J2s were recorded when EO was used at 1000 and 2000 μL/L concentrations. A constant reduction in root-knot nematode J2 hatching was observed upon increasing the concentration of HL from 5% to 50%. The EO of <i>C. cyminum</i> is characterized by the presence of γ-terpinene-7-al (34.95%), cumin aldehydes (26.48), and α-terpinene-7-al (12.77%). The above constituents were observed in HL following the same order as that observed in EO. The components γ-terpinene (11.09%) and <i>ο</i>-cymene (6.56%) were also recorded in EO while they were absent in HL."

      "Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a zoonotic helminthiasis caused by different species of the genus Echinococcus, and is a major economic and public health concern worldwide. Synthetic anthelmintics are most commonly used to control CE, however, prolonged use of these drugs may result in many adverse effects. This study aims to discuss the in vitro/in vivo scolicidal efficacy of different medicinal plants and their components used against Echinococcus granulosus. Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, PubMed and Scopus were used to retrieve the published literature from 2000-2020. A total of 62 published articles met the eligibility criteria and were reviewed. A total of 52 plant species belonging to 22 families have been reported to be evaluated as scolicidal agents against E. granulosus worldwide. Most extensively used medicinal plants against E. granulosus belong to the family Lamiaceae (25.0%) followed by Apiaceae (11.3%). Among various plant parts, leaves (36.0%) were most commonly used. Essential oils of Zataria multiflora and Ferula asafetida at a concentration of 0.02, and 0.06 mg/ml showed 100% in vitro scolicidal activity after 10 min post application, respectively. Z. multiflora also depicted high in vivo efficacy by decreasing weight and size while also causing extensive damage to the germinal layer of the cysts. Plant-based compounds like berberine, thymol, and thymoquinone have shown high efficacy against E. granulosus. These plant species and compounds could be potentially used for the development of an effective drug against E. granulosus, if further investigated for in vivo efficacy, toxicity, and mechanism of drug action in future research."

      "Recently, increasing public concern about hygiene has been driving many studies to investigate antimicrobial and antiviral agents. However, the use of any antimicrobial agents must be limited due to their possible toxic or harmful effects. In recent years, due to previous antibiotics' lesser side effects, the use of herbal materials instead of synthetic or chemical drugs is increasing. Herbal materials are found in medicines. Herbs can be used in the form of plant extracts or as their active components. Furthermore, most of the world's populations used herbal materials due to their strong antimicrobial properties and primary healthcare benefits. For example, herbs are an excellent material to replace nanosilver as an antibiotic and antiviral agent. The use of nanosilver involves an ROS-mediated mechanism that might lead to oxidative stress-related cancer, cytotoxicity, and heart diseases. Oxidative stress further leads to increased ROS production and also delays the cellular processes involved in wound healing. Therefore, existing antibiotic drugs can be replaced with biomaterials such as herbal medicine with high antimicrobial, antiviral, and antioxidant activity. This review paper highlights the antibacterial, antiviral, and radical scavenger (antioxidant) properties of herbal materials. Antimicrobial activity, radical scavenger ability, the potential for antimicrobial, antiviral, and anticancer agents, and efficacy in eliminating bacteria and viruses and scavenging free radicals in herbal materials are discussed in this review. The presented herbal antimicrobial agents in this review include clove, portulaca, tribulus, eryngium, cinnamon, turmeric, ginger, thyme, pennyroyal, mint, fennel, chamomile, burdock, eucalyptus, primrose, lemon balm, mallow, and garlic, which are all summarized."

      "Plant-based diets have become popular as a means of reducing the environmental footprint of the diet and promoting human health and animal welfare. Although the percentages of vegetarians and vegans are low compared to omnivores, their numbers have increased significantly in the last years. The use of non-animal food products other than meat alternatives is also increasing and this tendency constitutes an opportunity for the food industry. In this review, we present that plant-based meat and milk alternatives are consolidated but that there is a niche for egg, seafood alternatives, and new products which may not resemble any traditional animal food. However, not all animal food substitutes are sustainable and some of them are even ultra-processed. In addition, there are concerns on safety and labeling, and consumers demand clear information and regulation. The challenges in this field are connected with food design and technology, sensory science, nutrition, and dietetics. Moreover, adequate selection and combination of foods is important in order to achieve consumer acceptance while preventing nutritional deficiencies in those who choose this type of diet."

      "Wheat grains are exposed to several plagues after harvesting and during storage. These plagues include bacteria, fungi, and insects with detrimental outcomes to their quality and heavy losses to the farmers. Fungi are of special interest because of their ability to produce mycotoxins with health concerns. Once grains are harvested, synthetic fungicides, which are sprayed before long-term storage, normally control fungi; however, these synthetic products represent a health concern because of their toxicities. Previously, we reported the antifungal activity of the essential oils extracted from <i>Porophyllum linaria</i>, <i>Agastache mexicana</i>, and <i>Buddleja perfoliata</i> against fungal strains isolated from stored wheat. In this study, we sprayed wheat grains with the same essential oils to measure their persistence interval and to prepare baked products to assess potential changes in their physical properties. The persistence interval of the essential oils in grains indicated that it takes between 63 and 134 days to eliminate 90% of the original compounds. This extended time of the compounds in the grains together with a lack of physical properties modifications of the flour and baked products (post-treatment) suggest that the presence of oils in the grains is potentially safe to use. The solid data denote the technological feasibility of the treatment and the possible management of residues through adequate safety intervals."

      "<h4>Background</h4>Today, the present protoscolicidals used to minimize the serious risks during hydatid cyst surgery are not completely safe and have various adverse side effects. The present study aimed to evaluate the chemical composition and apoptotic activity of <i>Ferula macrecolea</i> essential oil (FMEO) as well as its in vitro and ex vivo protoscolicidal effects against hydatid cyst protoscoleces.<h4>Methods</h4>Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis was performed to determine the chemical composition of FMEO. Protoscoleces of hydatid cysts were collected from liver fertile hydatid cysts of infected sheep and were then treated with various concentrations of the essential oil (75, 150, and 300 µL/mL) for 5-60 min in vitro and ex vivo. Then, by using the eosin exclusion test, the viability of the protoscoleces was studied. The caspase-3-like activity of the FMEO-treated protoscoleces was also evaluated through the colorimetric protease assay Sigma Kit based on the manufacturer's instructions.<h4>Results</h4>According to GC/MS, the main constituents of the essential oil were terpinolene (77.72%), n-nonanal (4.47%), and linalool (4.35%), respectively. In vitro, the maximum protoscolicidal activity of FMEO was observed at the concentrations of 150 and 300 µL/mL, such that 100% of the protoscoleces were killed after 30 and 20 min of exposure, respectively. Based on the obtained findings, the results demonstrate that FMEO required a longer time to kill protoscoleces ex vivo; after 12 min of exposure to FMEO, only 13.4% of the protoscoleces remained alive. After 48 h of the treatment of protoscoleces, FMEO, in a dose-dependent manner and at doses of 75, 150, and 300 µL/mL, induced the activation of the caspase enzyme by 24.3, 35.3, and 48.3%, respectively.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our findings demonstrate the potent protoscolicidal effects of FMEO in vitro and ex vivo; however, further studies are required to assess the safety and the efficiency of FMEO as a promising scolicidal agent in a preclinical model and clinical setting."

      "Even though several plants can improve the female reproductive function, the use of herbs, herbal preparations, or essential oils during pregnancy is questionable. This review is focused on the effects of some essential oils and their constituents on the female reproductive system during pregnancy and on the development of the fetus. The major concerns include causing abortion, reproductive hormone modulation, maternal toxicity, teratogenicity, and embryo-fetotoxicity. This work summarizes the important studies on the reproductive effects of essential oil constituents anethole, apiole, citral, camphor, thymoquinone, <i>trans</i>-sabinyl acetate, methyl salicylate, thujone, pulegone, β-elemene, β-eudesmol, and costus lactone, among others."

      "<i>Thymus mastichina</i> has the appearance of a semishrub and can be found in jungles and rocky lands of the Iberian Peninsula. This work aimed to review and gather available scientific information on the composition and biological properties of <i>T. mastichina</i>. The main constituents of <i>T. mastichina</i> essential oil are 1,8-cineole (or eucalyptol) and linalool, while the extracts are characterized by the presence of flavonoids, phenolic acids, and terpenes. The essential oil and extracts of <i>T. mastichina</i> have demonstrated a wide diversity of biological activities. They showed antibacterial activity against several bacteria such as <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Proteus mirabilis</i>, <i>Salmonella</i> subsp., methicillin-resistant and methicillin-sensitive <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Listeria monocytogenes EGD</i>, <i>Bacillus cereus</i>, and <i>Pseudomonas</i>, among others, and antifungal activity against <i>Candida</i> spp. and <i>Fusarium</i> spp. Additionally, it has antioxidant activity, which has been evaluated through different methods. Furthermore, other activities have also been studied, such as anticancer, antiviral, insecticidal, repellent, anti-Alzheimer, and anti-inflammatory activity. In conclusion, considering the biological activities reported for the essential oil and extracts of <i>T. mastichina</i>, its potential as a preservative agent could be explored to be used in the food, cosmetic, or pharmaceutical industries."

      "<h4>Background</h4>Paeonia lactiflora 'Hangshao' is widely cultivated in China as a traditional Chinese medicine 'Radix Paeoniae Alba'. Due to the abundant unsaturated fatty acids in its seed, it can also be regarded as a new oilseed plant. However, the process of the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids in it has remained unknown. Therefore, transcriptome analysis is helpful to better understand the underlying molecular mechanisms.<h4>Results</h4>Five main fatty acids were detected, including stearic acid, palmitic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid and α-linolenic acid, and their absolute contents first increased and then decreased during seed development. A total of 150,156 unigenes were obtained by transcriptome sequencing. There were 15,005 unigenes annotated in the seven functional databases, including NR, NT, GO, KOG, KEGG, Swiss-Prot and InterPro. Based on the KEGG database, 1766 unigenes were annotated in the lipid metabolism. There were 4635, 12,304, and 18,291 DEGs in Group I (60 vs 30 DAF), Group II (90 vs 60 DAF) and Group III (90 vs 30 DAF), respectively. A total of 1480 DEGs were detected in the intersection of the three groups. In 14 KEGG pathways of lipid metabolism, 503 DEGs were found, belonging to 111 enzymes. We screened out 123 DEGs involved in fatty acid biosynthesis (39 DEGs), fatty acid elongation (33 DEGs), biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acid (24 DEGs), TAG assembly (17 DEGs) and lipid storage (10 DEGs). Furthermore, qRT-PCR was used to analyze the expression patterns of 16 genes, including BBCP, BC, MCAT, KASIII, KASII, FATA, FATB, KCR, SAD, FAD2, FAD3, FAD7, GPAT, DGAT, OLE and CLO, most of which showed the highest expression at 45 DAF, except for DGAT, OLE and CLO, which showed the highest expression at 75 DAF.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We predicted that MCAT, KASIII, FATA, SAD, FAD2, FAD3, DGAT and OLE were the key genes in the unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis and oil accumulation in herbaceous peony seed. This study provides the first comprehensive genomic resources characterizing herbaceous peony seed gene expression at the transcriptional level. These data lay the foundation for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of fatty acid biosynthesis and oil accumulation for herbaceous peony."

      "Chemical profile and antioxidant activity of the species <i>Veronica saturejoides</i> Vis. ssp. <i>saturejoides</i> (Plantaginaceae)-which is endemic to Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro -were investigated. Volatile compounds produced by glandular trichomes (composed of one stalk cell and two elliptically formed head cells according to scanning electron microscope investigation) were isolated from the plants collected in two locations. Additionally, as a part of specialized metabolites, total polyphenols, total tannins, total flavonoids and total phenolic acids were determined spectrophotometrically. In the lipophilic volatile fractions-essential oils, the most abundant compounds identified were hexahydrofarnesyl acetone, caryophyllene oxide and hexadecanoic acid. In total, the class of oxygenated sesquiterpenes and the group of fatty aldehydes, acids and alcoholic compounds dominated in the essential oils. In the hydrophilic volatile fractions-hydrosols, the most abundant compounds identified were <i>trans-p-</i>mentha-1(7),8-dien-2-ol, <i>allo</i>-aromadendrene and <i>(E)-</i>caryophyllene. A group of oxygenated monoterpenes and the sesquiterpene hydrocarbons dominated in the hydrosols. Antioxidant activity of essential oils and hydrosols was tested with two methods: 2,2'-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC). Essential oils showed higher antioxidant activity than hydrosols and showed similar antioxidant activity to <i>Rosmarinus officinalis</i> essential oil. Obtained results demonstrate that this genus is a potential source of volatiles with antioxidant activity."

      "The aim of the research was to increase the efficiency of the hydrodistillation process and determine the volatile composition, biological activity, and aroma profile of essential oil from celery seeds (<i>Apium graveolens</i> L.). The essential oil was extracted from the plant material by ultrasonic hydrodistillation with higher efficiency when compared with classical hydrodistillation. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated using the impedimetric method for the bacteria <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus,</i> and yeast <i>Candida vini</i> as well as moulds <i>Aspergillus niger</i> and <i>Penicillium expansum</i> with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) (μL/mL) values: 30, 10, 20, 3, 30, 40, and 40, respectively. The oil possessed very weak 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) antioxidant activity with the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) value of 81.6 g/L. Initial studies of the aroma profile indicated that the perception of the fragrance of the oil could be related to the sex of the panellists. According to women, the fragrance of celery seeds oil was intense herb-like. From the men's point of view, it had a fresh, mossy, and mushroom scent."

      "Plants and their constituents have been used to treat diverse ailments since time immemorial. Many plants are used in diverse external and internal formulations (infusions, alcoholic extracts, essential oils (EOs), etc.) in the treatment of inflammation-associated diseases, such as those affecting the respiratory tract or causing gastrointestinal or joint problems, among others. To support the traditional uses of plant extracts, EOs have been assessed for their alleged anti-inflammatory properties. However, the effect of EOs on the release of cytokines and chemokines has been much less reported. Considering their traditional use and commercial relevance in Portugal and Angola, this study evaluated the effect of EOs on the in vitro inhibition of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and the chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human acute monocytic leukemia cells (THP-1 cells). Twenty EOs extracted from eighteen species from seven families, namely from Amaranthaceae (<i>Dysphania ambrosioides</i>), Apiaceae (<i>Foeniculum vulgare</i>), Asteraceae (<i>Brachylaena huillensis</i>, <i>Solidago virgaurea</i>), Euphorbiaceae (<i>Spirostachys africana</i>), Lamiaceae (<i>Lavandula luisieri</i>, <i>Mentha cervina</i>, <i>Origanum majorana</i>, <i>Satureja montana</i>, <i>Thymbra capitata</i>, <i>Thymus mastichina</i>, <i>Thymus vulgaris</i>, <i>Thymus zygis</i> subsp. <i>zygis</i>), Myrtaceae (<i>Eucalyptus globulus</i> subsp. <i>maidenii</i>, <i>Eucalyptus radiata</i>, <i>Eucalyptus viminalis</i>) and Pinaceae (<i>Pinus pinaster</i>) were assayed for the release of CCL2 and TNF-α by LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells. <i>B. huillensis, S. africana, S. montana, Th. mastichina</i> and <i>Th. vulgaris</i> EOs showed toxicity to THP-1 cells, at the lowest concentration tested (10 μg/mL), using the tetrazolium dye assay. The most active EOs in reducing TNF-α release by LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells were those of <i>T. capitata</i> (51% inhibition at 20 μg/mL) and <i>L. luisieri</i> (15-23% inhibition at 30 μg/mL and 78-83% inhibition at 90 μg/mL). <i>L. luisieri</i> EO induced a concentration-dependent inhibition of CCL2 release by LPS‑stimulated THP-1 cells (23%, 54% and 82% inhibition at 10, 30 and 90 μg/mL, respectively). These EOs are potentially useful in the management of inflammatory diseases mediated by CCL2 and TNF‑α, such as atherosclerosis and arthritis."

      "Greek oregano and common oregano were compared in respect of the antioxidant and antibacterial activity of the corresponding essential oils and hydroethanolic extracts in relation with their chemical profile. The chemical composition of essential oils was determined by GC-MS and GC-FID, while extracts (phenolic acids and flavonoids fractions) were analyzed by HPLC-DAD. Based on given volatiles, the investigated subspecies represented two chemotypes: a carvacrol/γ-terpinene/<i>p</i>-cymene type in the case of Greek oregano and a sabinyl/cymyl type rich in terpinen-4-ol in common oregano. Within non-volatile phenolic compounds, rosmarinic acid appeared to dominate in both subspecies. Lithospermic acid B, chlorogenic acid and isovitexin were present only in Greek oregano extracts. However, the total content of flavonoids was higher in common oregano extracts. The essential oil and extract of Greek oregano revealed visibly stronger antibacterial activity (expressed as MIC and MBC) than common oregano, whereas the antioxidant potential (determined by DPPH, ABTS and FRAP) of these extracts was almost equal for both subspecies. In the case of <i>Origanum</i> plants, the potential application of essential oils and extracts as antiseptic and antioxidant agents in the food industry should be preceded by subspecies identification followed by recognition of their chemotype concerning both terpene and phenolics composition."

      "The Italian Law of 22 November 2016 has legalized the cultivation of hemp, which drives the development of sustainable agriculture by generating new products with high added value in the new context of circular economy. Hemp cultivation is known for its low environmental impact, as hemp grows fast, suppresses weeds and does not need pesticides. It has no specialized parasites, favors pollination and improves the physical and chemical soil fertility. Recently, many countries have increased their interest in hemp (Cannabis Sativa L.), considering it as a climate-friendly crop that can mitigate climate change and desertification. For these reasons, hemp can be a new protagonist of Italian agriculture already oriented towards the objectives of EU 2030 which predicts 40% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990. The hemp cultivation can activate a new supply chain by allowing using different parts of the plant, benefiting farmers, environment, and human health. Indeed, although a very old plant, hemp will be one of the main protagonists of the green economy in the near future. Its seeds can be used by agri-food industry to produce flour, pasta, pastry and oil, while the stem through canapulo (woody part of stem) in green building sector. Its fiber (external part of stem) will find new applications in textile industry. As for its inflorescences and roots, thanks to the extraction of bioactive molecules, they will play an important role in the pharmaceutical and parapharmaceutical industry. Finally, only the medical sector with Δ9‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) extraction from inflorescence is not yet regulated by the aforementioned Italian Law."

      "Wild food plants (WFP) have always been present in our kitchen, although they have not always been given the same importance as crops. In the Catalan linguistic area (CLA), covered in this paper, WFP were of great importance as a subsistence food not only during the years of the Spanish civil war (1936-1939) and World War II (1939-1945), but also long before these periods and in the years thereafter. The CLA has been well studied at the level of traditional knowledge on plant biodiversity, and much of this information is collected in a database by the EtnoBioFiC research group. The aim of this work is to carry out a meta-analysis of the WFP dataset of he CLA (only regarding edible uses, drinks excluded) and to identify the most quoted plants, and the information associated with them. With data from 1659 informants, we recorded 10,078 use reports of 291 taxa (278 of which at specific or subspecific levels and 13 only determined at generic level) belonging to 67 families. The most reported taxa, also with highest cultural importance indexes, are <i>Thymus vulgaris</i>, <i>Foeniculum vulgare</i> subsp. <i>piperitum</i>, <i>Laurus nobilis</i>, <i>Rubus ulmifolius</i> and <i>Mentha spicata</i>. The ethnobotanicity index for food plants is 6.62% and the informant consensus factor, also for food uses, is a very high 0.97, supporting the robustness of the information. The results provided and discussed in this work concern a significant part of the edible resources in the territory considered, which is, often and mainly, underestimated and underutilised. Its consideration could be an opportunity to promote closer and more sustainable agriculture. From the state-of-the-art of this question, it is possible to propose old, in some cases forgotten foods that could be newly introduced onto the market, first, but not only, at a local level, which could be interesting for new crop development in the frame of a valorisation of territorial identity."

      "The coastal and subcoastal areas of west-central Morocco (Safi to Draa River, the Souss Valley, and the southern part of the western High Atlas and northern and southern slopes of the western Anti-Atlas) are characterized by typical Infra-Mediterranean vegetation ranking them amongst the important of the remarkable borderlands of North Africa. The flora is determined by complex historical and environmental factors occurring since the Tertiary period. The originality of this sector is due to the presence of the argan tree (Argania spinosa (L.) Skeels), Moroccan gum (Acacia gummifera Willd), olive trees (Olea europaea L. subsp. maroccana (Greuter & Burdet) P. Vargas & al.), a thermophilic flora adapted to an arid climate with several endemic species. This flora constitutes the final barrier against the desert and is of environmental and socioeconomical interest. Leaves and fruits provide forage material, while wood is used for fuel. Argan fruits are collected for their oily constitutes and for nutritional, cosmetic, and medicinal properties. Additionally, many species of Argan ecosystems are used in medicine and cosmetics. Recognizing its ecological value and local economic importance, the Argan region was declared a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1998. Despite their biogeographical, historical, and socioeconomic value, vegetation structures in west-central Morocco are vulnerable and threatened by human activities. They exhibit high levels of degradation due to increasing clearance, overgrazing, and overexploitation. The area requires high conservation priority and sustainable management strategies for key species and genetic diversity."

      "<i>Euphorbia</i> species have a large spectrum of traditional medicinal uses. We tested the biological activities of the essential oil (EO) of <i>Euphorbia intisy</i> Drake in an acquired multidrug resistance leukemia model to assess whether the EO obtained by hydrodistillation of stems was able to reverse the resistant phenotype. HL-60R cell lines are characterized by the overexpression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) and constitutive expression of NF-κB. EO chemical composition was determined by GC/MS analysis; cytotoxic activity of EO by MTS assay alone or in combination with doxorubicin; pro-apoptotic effect and doxorubicin accumulation were analyzed by flow cytometry; P-gp ATPase activity was measured by P-gp-Glo™ assay systems kit. The ability to inhibit NF-κB and its target genes was also assessed. <i>E. intisy</i> EO exhibited a comparable cytotoxic effect and ability to block P-gp in both the HL-60 and its MDR variant HL-60R. In addition, EO suppressed P-gp protein expression and significantly downregulated MDR1 mRNA level, as well as some IAPs proteins, probably through the inhibition of NF-κB. Our results suggest that <i>E. intisy</i> EO could reverse P-gp-mediated drug resistance in tumor cells acting as a chemosensitizing agent."

      "<h4>Background</h4>Inflammation is a host defense mechanism in the body after it is infected and damaged. If inflammation is not treated in time, then it may cause a variety of diseases, such as cancer and autoimmune diseases. Herbal essential oils are natural extracts that can suppress inflammation effectively and are expected to be used in therapeutic drugs for anti-inflammatory diseases in the future. <i>Aim of the review</i>. We review the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of essential oils derived from 16 herbs. <i>Materials and methods</i>. We searched the literature of the fields of anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory herbal essential oil activity published in English within the past five years via databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and The Web of Science).<h4>Results</h4>A total of 1932 papers were found by searching, and 132 papers were screened after removing duplicates and reading article titles. Fifteen articles met the requirements to be included in this review. Among those selected, 11 articles reported in vivo research results, and 10 articles showed research results.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Essential oils extracted from herbs can reduce inflammation by regulating the release of inflammatory cytokines involved in multiple signalling pathways. Herbal essential oils are expected to be developed as anti-inflammatory drugs."

      "<i>Origanum vulgare</i> L. is a widely used aromatic plant, especially due to its content in essential oil, mainly rich in carvacrol and thymol. The ethnopharmacological uses of <i>Origanum vulgare</i> L. essential oil (OEO) comprise digestive, respiratory, or dermatological disorders. The review focuses on the increasing number of recent studies investigating several biological activities of OEO. The bioactivities are in tight relation to the phytochemical profile of the essential oil, and also depend on taxonomic, climatic, and geographical characteristics of the plant material. The antibacterial, antifungal, antiparasitic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, skin disorders beneficial effects, next to antihyperglycemic and anti-Alzheimer activities were reported and confirmed in multiple studies. Moreover, recent studies indicate a positive impact on skin disorders of OEO formulated as nanocarrier systems in order to improve its bioavailability and, thus, enhancing its therapeutic benefits. The review brings an up to date regarding the phytochemistry and bioactivity of <i>Origanum vulgare</i> L. essential oil, underlining also the most successful pharmaceutical formulation used for skin disorders."

      "Nowadays, herbal extracts are considered to be a potential source for developing new drugs that will overcome resistance to conventional chemotherapeutic agents. This study was aimed to explore the efficacy of several Egyptian plant extracts against Toxoplasma gondii infection in vitro for future development of a new, safe, and effective compound for T. gondii. Methanol extracts from Matricaria chamomilla (German chamomile), Laurus nobilis, Citrullus colocynthis, Cinnamum camphora, Boswellia scara, and Melissa officionalis plants and oil extracts (either essential or fixed oils) of some plants such as: lemon grass (Cymbopogon citratus), marjoram (Origanum majorana), watercress (Nasturtium officionale), wheat germ (Triticum aestivum), sesame (Sesamum indicum), rosemary (Salvia rosmarinus), citronella (Cymbopogon nardus), clove (Syzygum aromaticum), jojoba (Simmondsia chinesis), and basil (Ocimum basilicum) were investigated for their anti-Toxoplasma activities. The methanol extracts from C. colocynthis and L. nobilis and the oil extracts from lemon grass and marjoram were active against T. gondii with half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC<sub>50</sub>) of 22.86 µg/ml, 31.35 µg/ml, 4.6 µg/ml, and 26.24 µg/ml, respectively. Their selectivity index (SI) values were <10. Interestingly, the methanol extract from M. chamomilla and oil from citronella had the lowest IC<sub>50</sub> values for T. gondii (3.56 µg/ml and 2.54 µg/ml, respectively) and the highest SI values (130.33 and 15.02, respectively). In conclusion, methanol extract from M. chamomilla and oil from citronella might be potential sources of novel therapies for treating toxoplasmosis."

      "<i>Carlina acaulis</i> L. has a long tradition of use in folk medicine. The chemical composition of the roots and green parts of the plant is quite well known. There is the lowest amount of data on the cypsela (fruit) of this plant. In this study, the microscopic structures and the chemical composition of the cypsela were investigated. Preliminary cytochemical studies of the structure of the <i>Carlina acaulis</i> L. cypsela showed the presence of substantial amounts of protein and lipophilic substances. The chemical composition of the cypsela was investigated using spectrophotometry, gas chromatography with mass spectrometry, and high-performance liquid chromatography with spectrophotometric and fluorescence detection. The cypsela has been shown to be a rich source of macro- and microelements, vegetable oil (25%), α-tocopherol (approx. 2 g/kg of oil), protein (approx. 36% seed weight), and chlorogenic acids (approx. 22 g/kg seed weight). It also contains a complex set of volatile compounds. The <i>C. acaulis</i> cypsela is, therefore, a valuable source of nutrients and bioactive substances."

      "Chemical pesticides used against insect pests of stored food have adverse effects on both health and the environment. So, the present study aims to evaluate the insect repulsive and insecticidal power of <i>Ruta chalepensis</i> L. essential oil (EO) from the region of Oulmes (Central plateau of Morocco); the ultimate objective is to develop a biological and ecological control strategy against pests. Thus, the EO obtained by hydrodistillation from the aerial parts of <i>Ruta chalepensis</i> L. was identified by GC-MS; its repellent and fumigant toxicity effects on adults of <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> Herbst were, respectively, investigated by the preferential area method on a filter paper and the inhalation test. The insecticide power was estimated by determining the percentage of mortality as a function of the duration of exposure and concentration of the EO. The essential oil obtained is characterized by the dominance of 2-undecanone (64.35%), piperonyl piperazine (11.9%), 2-decanaone (5.12%), 2-dodecanone (4.52%), decipidone (3.9%,) and 2-tridecanone (2.36%). This EO is endowed with a very repulsive power belonging to class V, which is strongly due to its majority compound 2-undecanone. The dose 0.038 <i>μ</i>l/ml gave a repellent power of 100% after 15 min. The tests also revealed a considerable insecticidal effect, which reached 100% after 48 hours at a dose of 0.62 <i>μ</i>l/ml. The calculation of the lethal dose causing 50% mortality (LD50) and the lethal times after which there is 50% mortality (LT50) allowed deducing that the insecticidal effect of <i>Ruta chalepensis</i> L. is time- and dose-dependent. Hence, the effectiveness of <i>Ruta chalepensis</i> L. EO attests that it can constitute a healthy alternative to fight against <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> Herbst."

      "Chocolate is a complex soft material characterized by solid particles (cocoa powder, milk solid particles and sugar crystals) dispersed in a crystallized fat matrix mostly composed of cocoa butter (CB). Important chocolate properties such as snap, and visual appearance are strongly dependent on the internal molecular arrangement (polymorph), size and shape, as well as the spatial distribution of CB crystals within the chocolate mix. In recent years confectionary companies have put increasing effort in developing novel chocolate recipes to improve the nutritional profile of chocolate products (e.g., by reducing the amount of high saturated fat and sugar content) and to counteract the increasing price of cocoa butter as well as sustainability issues related to some chocolate ingredients. Different reformulation strategies can dramatically affect the crystallization thermodynamic and kinetic behaviour of cocoa butter; therefore, affecting the structural and sensorial properties of chocolate. In this review we analyse how different reformulation strategies affect the crystallization behaviour of cocoa butter and, hence, the structural and sensorial properties of chocolate. In particular, this work discusses the effect of: (1) CB replacement with emulsions, hydrogels, oleogels and oleofoams; (2) CB dilution with limonene or cocoa butter equivalents; (3) replacement or reduction of the amount of sugar and milk in chocolate. We found that there is certainly potential for successful novel alternative chocolate products with controlled crystalline properties; however, further research is still needed to ensure sensory acceptance and reasonable shelf-life of these novel products."

      "The invasive red imported fire ant, <i>Solenopsis invicta</i> Buren (hereafter, fire ants), is a significant threat to public health and a danger to livestock, pets and wildlife due to their venomous stings. The fire ant has invaded many countries and regions and has become a globally significant pest. The current major tool to manage fire ants are synthetic insecticides that are used largely as stomach poisons in bait products or contact insecticides in spray, broadcast, drench, and dust products for area and nest treatments. In addition to these insecticide products, repellants and fumigants can also be useful in some unique scenarios. The ever-increasing public concern about the potential adverse effects of synthetic insecticides on health and the environment has been a driving force for searching for safer alternatives to control fire ants. Tremendous effort has been made in developing biologically-based control for managing fire ants; however, natural products continue to be one of the most attractive sources of safe alternatives to synthetic insecticides. Here, we summarized the synthetic insecticides that are currently used in managing fire ants, available alternative products in the current market, and academic efforts in searching for fire ant natural toxins, repellants and fumigants."

      "<h4>Objectives</h4>Several toxins and molecules are able to damage the liver, causing the hepato-toxicity. This disorder can be protected naturally, by some essential oils obtained from different plants. In this review we are cited some of these compounds that have been tested by their hepatoprotective effect.<h4>Methods</h4>We reviewed 83 articles published between 1981 and 2018 in English via three databases Sciencedirect, Springer and PubMed. So, we have used the keywords Hepatoprotective effect, liver disease, plants and essential oils.<h4>Results and conclusion</h4>In this work, we classified the plants; contain the essential oils, in alphabetical order as a table containing the scientific, family names, information plants, the experimental assay and the results obtained from the hepatoprotective studies. We have described 27 species belonging to 12 families Lamiaceae (7 species), Asteraceae (6 species), Umbellifereae (3 species), Apiaceae (3 species) are the main families which enclose the species that was studied. The study also includes the major compounds isolated from some of these essential oils. The most of those compounds belong to terpene class essentially cineol, carvacrol and thymol. Thus, the different essential oils that have been cited in this review were shown that have an antioxidant activity."

      "The granary weevil <i>Sitophilus granarius</i> is a stored product pest found worldwide. Environmental damages, human health issues and the emergence of resistance are driving scientists to seeks alternatives to synthetic insecticides for its control. With low mammal toxicity and low persistence, essential oils are more and more being considered a potential alternative. In this study, we compare the toxicity of 25 essential oils, representing a large array of chemical compositions, on adult granary weevils. Bioassays indicated that <i>Allium sativum</i> was the most toxic essential oil, with the lowest calculated lethal concentration 90 (LC90) both after 24 h and 7 days. <i>Gaultheria procumbens</i>, <i>Mentha arvensis</i> and <i>Eucalyptus dives</i> oils appeared to have a good potential in terms of toxicity/cost ratio for further development of a plant-derived biocide. Low influence of exposure time was observed for most of essential oils. The methodology developed here offers the possibility to test a large array of essential oils in the same experimental bioassay and in a standardized way. It is a first step to the development of new biocide for alternative management strategies of stored product pests."

      "Fungal contamination in stored food grains is a global concern and affects food economics and human and animal health. It is clear that there is a need to develop new technologies with improved performances that are also eco-friendly in nature. Due to the bioactivity of essential oils (EOs) in the vapor phase, their low toxicity for humans, and their biodegradability and antifungal properties, EOs could be a suitable solution. In this study, we explored the potential of thyme, oregano, lemongrass, clove, and cajeput EOs in the vapor phase. For 17 days, inhibitory activity was assessed against five strains of postharvest pathogens—Aspergillus spp., Fusarium s. l. spp., and Penicilliumochrochloron—isolated from cereal grains. A modified disc volatilization method was used, which is more effective in comparison to traditional screening methods. Three concentrations were tested (250, 125, and 62.5 μL/L). The two highest concentrations resulted in complete inhibition of fungal growth; however, even 62.5 μL/L showed a significant antifungal effect. The efficiency of EOs followed this order: thyme > oregano > lemongrass > clove > cajeput. From our findings, it appears that the use of EOs vapors is a better option not only for laboratory experiments, but for subsequent practice."

      "The leaves of <i>Homalomena aromatica</i> are traditionally used in Bangladesh for the treatment of different chronic ailments. The purpose of this study was to explore in vitro antioxidant, thrombolytic activities, and in vivo neuropharmacological effects of methanolic extract of <i>Homalomena aromatica</i> (MEHA) leaves. Antioxidant activity of MEHA was assessed by a DPPH free radical scavenging assay and total phenolics content, total flavonoids content were also measured. The thrombolytic activity was determined by percentage of clot lysis and neuropharmacological activities by hole board, tail suspension, forced swimming and elevated plus maze tests. The results showed that the IC<sub>50</sub> value of the extract against DPPH was 199.51 μg/mL. Quantitative analysis displayed higher contents of phenolics and flavonoids (147.71 mg gallic acid equivalent/g & 66.65 mg quercetin equivalent/g dried extract, respectively). The extract also showed a significant clot lysis (33.31%) activity. In case of anxiolytic activity, the elevate plus maze (EPM) test demonstrated an increase in time spent in open arms, and in case of hole board test, the number of head dipping was also significantly increased (<i>p</i> < 0.05). All the test compared with control (1% Tween in water) and standard (diazepam 1 mg/kg), significant dose (200 & 400 mg/kg) dependent anxiolytic activity was found. In antidepressant activity, there was a significant decrease in period of immobility in both test models (tail suspension and forced swimming) (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Moreover, 13 compounds were identified as bioactive, showed good binding affinities to xanthine oxidoreductase, tissue plasminogen activator receptor, potassium channel receptor, human serotonin receptor targets in molecular docking experiments. Furthermore, ADME/T analysis revealed their drug-likeness, likely pharmacological actions and non-toxic upon consumption. Taken together, our finding support the traditional medicinal use of this plant, which may provide a potential source for future drug discovery."

      "<i>Artemisia absinthium</i>-wormwood (Asteraceae)-is a very important species in the history of medicine, formerly described in medieval Europe as \"<i>the most important master against all exhaustions</i>\". It is a species known as a medicinal plant in Europe and also in West Asia and North America. The raw material obtained from this species is <i>Absinthii herba</i> and <i>Artemisiae absinthii aetheroleum.</i> The main substances responsible for the biological activity of the herb are: the essential oil, bitter sesquiterpenoid lactones, flavonoids, other bitterness-imparting compounds, azulenes, phenolic acids, tannins and lignans. In the official European medicine, the species is used in both allopathy and homeopathy. In the traditional Asian and European medicine, it has been used as an effective agent in gastrointestinal ailments and also in the treatment of helminthiasis, anaemia, insomnia, bladder diseases, difficult-to-heal wounds, and fever. Today, numerous other directions of biological activity of the components of this species have been demonstrated and confirmed by scientific research, such as antiprotozoal, antibacterial, antifungal, anti-ulcer, hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, cytotoxic, analgesic, neuroprotective, anti-depressant, procognitive, neurotrophic, and cell membrane stabilizing and antioxidant activities. <i>A. absinthium</i> is also making a successful career as a cosmetic plant. In addition, the importance of this species as a spice plant and valuable additive in the alcohol industry (famous absinthe and vermouth-type wines) has not decreased. The species has also become an object of biotechnological research."

      "Diabetes is a global health problem, and the number of diabetic patients is in continuous rise. Conventional antidiabetic therapies are associated with high costs and limited efficiency. The use of traditional medicine and plant extracts to treat diabetes is gaining high popularity in many countries. Countries in the Middle East region have a long history of using herbal medicine to treat different diseases, including diabetes. In this review, we compiled and summarized all the in vivo and in vitro studies conducted for plants with potential antidiabetic activity in the Middle East region. Plants of the Asteraceae and Lamiaceae families are the most investigated. It is hoped that this review will contribute scientifically to evidence the ethnobotanical use of medicinal plants as antidiabetic agents. Work has to be done to define tagetes, mechanism of action and the compound responsible for activity. In addition, safety and pharmacokinetic parameters should be investigated."

      "Infusions and poultices prepared from the aerial parts of <i>Baccharis heterophylla</i> Kunth (Asteraceae) are widely used in Oaxaca (Mexico) for relieving painful and inflammatory complaints. Therefore, the antinociceptive potential of an aqueous extract (31.6-316 mg/kg, p.o.) and essential oil (30-177 µg/paw, i.pl.) of the plant was assessed using the formalin test. Both preparations inhibited the formalin-induced nociception response (100-316 mg/kg and 100-177 µg/paw, respectively) during the test's second phase. Chemical analysis of the aqueous extract revealed that the major active components were chlorogenic acid (<b>1</b>), 3,4-di-<i>O</i>-(<i>E</i>)-caffeoylquinic acid (<b>2</b>), 3,5-di-<i>O</i>-(<i>E</i>)-caffeoylquinic acid (<b>3</b>), 4,5-di-<i>O</i>-(<i>E</i>)-caffeoylquinic acid (<b>4</b>), 3,5-di-<i>O</i>-(<i>E</i>)-caffeoylquinic acid methyl ester (<b>5</b>), apigenin (<b>6</b>), genkwanin (<b>7</b>), acacetin (<b>8</b>). Compounds <b>1</b>-<b>5</b> and <b>8</b> are new for <i>B. heterophylla</i>. A high-pressure liquid chromatographic method for quantifying chlorogenic acid (<b>1</b>) and di-caffeoylquinic acids <b>2</b>-<b>4</b> in the plant was developed and validated. Analyses of the essential oil and the headspace solid-phase microextraction products, via gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry, revealed that the major volatiles were β-pinene, myrcene, D-limonene, β-caryophyllene, and α-caryophyllene, which have demonstrated antinociceptive properties."

      "The roots, bark, and leaves of <i>Cinnamomum camphora</i> are rich in essential oils, which mainly comprised monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. Although the essential oils obtained from <i>C. camphora</i> have been widely used in pharmaceutical, medicinal, perfume, and food industries, the molecular mechanisms underlying terpenoid biosynthesis are poorly understood. To address this lack of knowledge, we performed transcriptome analysis to investigate the key regulatory genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis in <i>C. camphora</i>. High-oil-yield trees of linalool type and low-oil-yield trees were used to assemble a <i>de novo</i> transcriptome of <i>C. camphora</i>. A total of 121,285 unigenes were assembled, and the total length, average length, N50, and GC content of unigenes were 87,869,987, 724, 1,063, and 41.1%, respectively. Comparison of the transcriptome profiles of linalool-type <i>C. camphora</i> with trees of low oil yield resulted in a total of 3,689 differentially expressed unigenes, among them 31 candidate genes had annotations associated with metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides, including four in the monoterpenoid biosynthesis pathway and three in the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathway. Collectively, this genome-wide transcriptome provides a valuable tool for future identification of genes related to essential oil biosynthesis. Additionally, the identification of a cohort of genes in the biosynthetic pathways of terpenoids provides a theoretical basis for metabolic engineering of essential oils in <i>C. camphora</i>."

      "<i>Clavibacter michiganensis</i> subsp. <i>michiganensis</i> (Smith) Davis et al. (Cmm) and <i>Ralstonia solanacearum</i> Yabuuchi et al. (Smith) (Rs) are important seed-borne bacterial pathogens of tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) listed as A2 pests in the EPPO (European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization) region. At present, there are few strategies to control these pathogens, and seed control with eco-compatible approaches is widely encouraged. In this work, the essential oils (EOs) of oregano (<i>Origanum vulgare</i>), garlic (<i>Allium sativum</i>), basil (<i>Ocimum basilicum</i>), cinnamon (<i>Cinnamomum zeylanicum</i>), clove buds (<i>Syzygium aromaticum</i>), thyme (<i>Thymus vulgaris</i>), and <i>Trametes versicolor</i> extract (Tve) were tested in vitro for their antimicrobial activity against Cmm and Rs (broth microdilution method). The tested EOs and the Tve extract caused a significant inhibition of bacterial growth, with very promising MBC (minimum bactericidal concentration) and MIC90 (minimum inhibitory concentration causing a 90% growth inhibition) values. Moreover, an in vivo germination test showed no major reduction in seed germination when the substances were applied as seed treatment. A rapid molecular screening method has been developed, through real-time PCR, for the specific quantification of Cmm in the presence of a vegetable matrix to test in vivo the antimicrobial efficacy of oregano and cinnamon oil on seed treatment without resorting to whole plant essays, which are time- and space-consuming."

      "The Sudd wetland is one of the oil-rich regions of South Sudan where environmental pollution resulting from oil extraction activities has been unprecedented. Although phytoremediation is the most feasible technique, its efficacy reduces at high TPH concentration in soil. This has made rhizoremediation the most preferred approach. Rhizoremediation involves use of a combination of phytoremediation and biostimulation. The process is catalyzed by the action of rhizobacteria. Therefore, the objective of this study is to characterize rhizobacteria communities prevalent in phytoremediation species growing in hydrocarbon-contaminated soils biostimulated with cattle manure. The treatments studied were plant species only (T1), plant species and hydrocarbons (T2), plant species and manure (T3), and plant species, manure, and hydrocarbons (T4). The rhizobacteria communities were determined using pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA. In the treatment with phytoremediation species, hydrocarbons 75 g · kg<sup>-1</sup>soil, and cattle manure 5 g · kg<sup>-1</sup>soil (T4), there was a significant increase (<i>p</i> < 0.05) in rhizobacteria abundance with the highest ASV observed in <i>H. rufa</i> (4980) and the lowest in <i>S. arundinaceum</i> (3955). In the same treatment, bacteria community diversity was high in <i>H. rufa</i> (Chao1, 10310) and the least in <i>S. arundinaceum</i> (Chao 1, 8260) with Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria as the dominant phyla. Similarly, in contaminated soil treated with cattle manure, there was a significant increase (<i>p</i> < 0.05) in abundance of rhizobacteria genera with <i>Pseudomonas</i> dominating across phytoremediation species. <i>H. rufa</i> was dominated by <i>Bacillus, Fusibacter,</i> and <i>Rhodococcus</i>; <i>G. barbadense</i> was mainly associated with <i>Luteimonas</i> and <i>Mycobacterium,</i> and <i>T. diversifolia</i> was inhabited by <i>Bacillus</i> and <i>Luteimonas</i>. The rhizosphere of <i>O. longistaminata</i> was dominated by <i>Bacillus, Fusibacter,</i> and <i>Luteimonas,</i> while <i>S. arundinaceum</i> was largely inhabited by <i>Sphingomonas.</i> These rhizobacteria genera ought to be applied in the Sudd region for bioremediation."

      "Asarum heterotropoides Fr. var. mandshuricum (Maxim) Kitag (Chinese wild ginger) is an important medicinal herb. Essential oil extracted from its roots is the key ingredient and is mainly composed of phenylpropanoid compounds. As a skiophyte plant, light is a crucial factor for A. heterotropoides var. mandshuricum growth and metabolism. To investigate the effects of light irradiation on the essential oil biosynthesis in A. heterotropoides var. mandshuricum, the plants were cultivated in four light irradiation treatments (100, 50, 24 and 12% full sunlight). The photosynthetic capacity, essential oil content and composition, activities of several enzymes and levels of some secondary metabolites involved in the shikimic acid and cinnamic acid pathways were analyzed. The leaf mass per area, average diurnal net photosynthetic rate, and the essential oil content increased significantly with increasing light intensity. Phenylalanine, cinnamic acid, and p-coumaric acid in the cinnamic acid pathway were at their highest levels in plants cultivated in 100% full sunlight. The highest content of shikimic acid in the shikimic acid pathway was obtained in plants grown in 50% sunlight transmittance. The activity of the enzymes 3-Deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, cinnamate-4-hydroxylase and 4-coumarate:CoA ligase increased proportionally with light intensity. Overall, we conclude that high light irradiation promotes high net photosynthetic rate, high activity of enzymes and high amounts of phenylpropanoid precursor metabolites leading to significant biosynthesis of essential oil in A. heterotropoides var. mandshuricum."

      "<h4>Background</h4>Freshwater snails are the intermediate hosts of a large variety of trematode flukes such as Schistosoma mansoni responsible for one of the most important parasitic diseases caused by helminths, affecting 67 million people worldwide. Recently, the WHO Global Vector Control Response 2017-2030 (GVCR) programme reinforced its message for safer molluscicides as part of required strategies to strengthen vector control worldwide. Here, we present the essential oil from Eryngium triquetrum as a powerful product with molluscicide and parasiticide effect against S. mansoni and the snail intermediate host Biomphalaria glabrata.<h4>Methods</h4>In the present study, we describe using several experimental approaches, the chemical composition of E. triquetrum essential oil extract and its biological effects against the snail B. glabrata and its parasite S. mansoni. Vector and the free-swimming larval stages of the parasite were exposed to different oil concentrations to determine the lethal concentration required to produce a mortality of 50% (LC<sub>50</sub>) and 90% (LC<sub>90</sub>). In addition, toxic activity of this essential oil was analyzed against embryos of B. glabrata snails by monitoring egg hatching and snail development. Also, short-time exposure to sublethal molluscicide concentrations on S. mansoni miracidia was performed to test a potential effect on parasite infectivity on snails. Mortality of miracidia and cercariae of S. mansoni is complete for 5, 1 and 0.5 ppm of oil extract after 1 and 4 h exposure.<h4>Results</h4>The major chemical component found in E. triquetrum oil determined by GC-FID and GC/MS analyses is an aliphatic polyacetylene molecule, the falcarinol with 86.9-93.1% of the total composition. The LC<sub>50</sub> and LC<sub>90</sub> values for uninfected snails were 0.61 and 1.02 ppm respectively for 24 h exposure. At 0.5 ppm, the essential oil was two times more toxic to parasitized snails with a mortality rate of 88.8 ± 4.8%. Moderate embryonic lethal effects were observed at the concentration of 1 ppm. Severe surface damage in miracidia was observed with a general loss of cilia that probably cause their immobility. Miracidia exposed 30 min to low concentration of plant extract (0.1 ppm) were less infective with 3.3% of prevalence compare to untreated with a prevalence of 44%.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Essential oil extracted from E. triquetrum and falcarinol must be considered as a promising product for the development of new interventions for schistosomiasis control and could proceed to be tested on Phase II according to the WHO requirements."

      "<i>Moringa oleifera</i> is originally a tropical crop with a fast development, little known in developed countries but cultivated since ancient times. It can adapt to regions affected by climate change, such as the Mediterranean basin, since it is a crop with a great resistance to high temperatures. In this study an in-depth bibliographical review was carried out by consulting different databases (Science Direct, FSTA, Scielo, Riunet, and Google Scholar) in order to find published scientific studies on the characteristics of this crop and its agronomic requirements. According to the information found, all parts of the <i>Moringa oleifera</i>, namely the leaves, pods, seeds, roots and flowers, can be used in different industrial sectors such as pharmaceutical, cosmetic, human food, animal feed, and water treatment since they have a nutritional profile rich in high biological value proteins, vitamins A and C, antioxidants, omega-3 fatty acids and minerals: calcium, iron, potassium, and phosphorous."

      "One of the most important challenges in the food industry is to provide healthy and safe food. Therefore, it is not possible to achieve this without different processes and the use of various additives. In order to improve safety and extend the shelf life of food products, various synthetic preservatives have been widely utilized by the food industry to prevent growth of spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms. On the other hand, consumers' preference to consume food products with natural additives induced food industries to use natural-based preservatives in their production. It has been observed that herbal extracts and their essential oils could be potentially considered as a replacement for chemical antimicrobials. Antimicrobial properties of plant essential oils are derived from some main bioactive components such as phenolic acids, terpenes, aldehydes, and flavonoids that are present in essential oils. Various mechanisms such as changing the fatty acid profile and structure of cell membranes and increasing the cell permeability as well as affecting membrane proteins and inhibition of functional properties of the cell wall are effective in antimicrobial activity of essential oils. Therefore, our objective is to revise the effect of various essential oils and their bioactive components against <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> in meat and poultry products."

      "In recent years, the intake of ultra-processed foods has increased dramatically worldwide. Missing natural foods in the diet raise the need of biologically active food components that could compensate for this deficiency and help maintain proper immune status. This study used pigs as an animal model for the assessment of the impact of consumption of <i>Origanum vulgare</i> plant extract combined with <i>Mentha piperita</i> and <i>Thymus vulgaris</i> essential oils on microbial profile in intestines. A single group of weaned pigs received basal diet, while the other group basal diet supplemented with plant extract and two essential oils in the form of bilayer tablets prepared using \"liquid/solid\" phase technology. Metagenomic sequencing was performed with the aim to investigate changes of microbial communities in ileum, caecum, and colon. The results demonstrated that the combination of essential oils was non cytotoxic, and had a positive effect on the microbial composition in the large intestine of pigs due to significant increase in the number of probiotic bacteria. The amount of <i>Lactobacillus</i> was 2.5 times and <i>Bifidobacterium</i> 1.9 times higher in the animal group fed with supplement. The combination, however, had some negative impact on the variety of minor species in the distal part of the ileum. Additional studies need to be performed to obtain knowledge on how combinations of essential oils can change bacterial variety in the proximal part of the gastrointestinal tract."

      "<i>Artemisia vulgaris</i> L. (common mugwort) is a species with great importance in the history of medicine and was called the \"mother of herbs\" in the Middle Ages. It is a common herbaceous plant that exhibits high morphological and phytochemical variability depending on the location where it occurs. This species is well known almost all over the world. Its herb-<i>Artemisiae vulgaris herba</i>-is used as a raw material due to the presence of essential oil, flavonoids, and sesquiterpenoids lactones and their associated biological activities. The European Pharmacopoeia has listed this species as a potential homeopathic raw material. Moreover, this species has been used in traditional Chinese, Hindu, and European medicine to regulate the functioning of the gastrointestinal system and treat various gynecological diseases. The general aim of this review was to analyze the progress of phytochemical and pharmacological as well as professional scientific studies focusing on <i>A. vulgaris</i>. Thus far, numerous authors have confirmed the beneficial properties of <i>A. vulgaris</i> herb extracts, including their antioxidant, hepatoprotective, antispasmolytic, antinociceptive, estrogenic, cytotoxic, antibacterial, and antifungal effects. In addition, several works have reviewed the use of this species in the production of cosmetics and its role as a valuable spice in the food industry. Furthermore, biotechnological micropropagation of <i>A. vulgaris</i> has been analyzed."

      "Hyptis crenata, commonly known as \"salva-do-Marajó\", \"hortelã-do-campo\", and \"hortelãzinha\", is used in folk medicine in Northeast Brazil as tea or infusion to treat inflammatory diseases. Due to the pharmacological efficacy and the low toxicity of the essential oil of Hyptis crenata (EOHc), we decided to investigate the EOHc antiedematogenic effect in experimental models of inflammation. EOHc was administrated orally at doses of 10-300 mg/kg to male Swiss albino mice. Paw edema was induced by subcutaneous injection in the right hind paw of inflammatory stimuli (carrageenan, dextran, histamine, serotonin, and bradykinin) 60 min after administration of EOHc. EOHc significantly inhibited the induced edema. The inhibitory effect of EOHc on dextran-induced edema extended throughout the experimental time. For the 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg doses of EOHc, the inhibition was of 40.28±1.70, 51.18±2.69, and 59.24±2.13%, respectively. The EOHc inhibitory effect on carrageenan-induced edema started at 10 mg/kg at the second hour (h) and was maintained throughout the observation period. At 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg doses the inhibition started earlier, from 30 min. At the edema peak of 180 min, 56, 76, and 82% inhibition was observed for 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg doses, respectively. Additionally, the effect of EOHc on carrageenan-induced paw edema was influenced by the time of administration. The EOHc also inhibited myeloperoxidase activity. In conclusion, the EOHc showed a potent effect, both preventing and reversing the edema, consistent with its anti-inflammatory use in folk medicine."

      "Moving toward a more sustainable development, a pivotal role is played by circular economy and a smarter waste management. Industrial wastes from plants offer a wide spectrum of possibilities for their valorization, still being enriched in high added-value molecules, such as secondary metabolites (SMs). The current review provides an overview of the most common SM classes (chemical structures, classification, biological activities) present in different plant waste/by-products and their potential use in various fields. A bibliographic survey was carried out, taking into account 99 research articles (from 2006 to 2020), summarizing all the information about waste type, its plant source, industrial sector of provenience, contained SMs, reported bioactivities, and proposals for its valorization. This survey highlighted that a great deal of the current publications are focused on the exploitation of plant wastes in human healthcare and food (including cosmetic, pharmaceutical, nutraceutical and food additives). However, as summarized in this review, plant SMs also possess an enormous potential for further uses. Accordingly, an increasing number of investigations on neglected plant matrices and their use in areas such as veterinary science or agriculture are expected, considering also the need to implement \"greener\" practices in the latter sector."

      "Transcription factors (TFs) and their complex interplay are essential for directing specific genetic programs, such as responses to environmental stresses, tissue development, or cell differentiation by regulating gene expression. Knowledge regarding TF-TF cooperations could be promising in gaining insight into the developmental switches between the cultivars of <i>Brassica napus</i> L., namely Zhongshuang11 (ZS11), a double-low accession with high-oil- content, and Zhongyou821 (ZY821), a double-high accession with low-oil-content. In this regard, we analysed a time series RNA-seq data set of seed tissue from both of the cultivars by mainly focusing on the monotonically expressed genes (MEGs). The consideration of the MEGs enables the capturing of multi-stage progression processes that are orchestrated by the cooperative TFs and, thus, facilitates the understanding of the molecular mechanisms determining seed oil content. Our findings show that TF families, such as NAC, MYB, DOF, GATA, and HD-ZIP are highly involved in the seed developmental process. Particularly, their preferential partner choices as well as changes in their gene expression profiles seem to be strongly associated with the differentiation of the oil content between the two cultivars. These findings are essential in enhancing our understanding of the genetic programs in both cultivars and developing novel hypotheses for further experimental studies."

      "A population of 52 genotypes of Myrtle (<i>Myrtus communis</i> L.), selected in the framework of a domestication program and growing in the same collection field at Oristano (Central Western Sardinia, 39°54' N 8°35' E), was analyzed by GC/MS for leaf essential oil composition. The chemical composition of essential oils was quite variable with a number of compounds ranging from 31 to 78 depending on cultivar. One hundred and eighteen compounds were globally identified in the various genotypes. However, α-pinene, limonene, 1,8-cineole, α-terpineol, and linalool always resulted as main components with few differences among samples. Minor compounds have been the determining factors in differentiating or associating genotypes in the outputs of a principal component analysis (PCA), where the results of another analysis of fruit essential oils of the same genotypes were also jointly used. Genotypes were discriminated according to mother plant characterization or ecological variables, such as site altitude, soil nature, and presence or absence of calcareous soils in the substrate of the localities of origin."

      "Little is known about the pharmacological activity of <i>Monarda fistulosa</i> L. essential oils. To address this issue, we isolated essential oils from the flowers and leaves of <i>M. fistulosa</i> and analyzed their chemical composition. We also analyzed the pharmacological effects of <i>M. fistulosa</i> essential oils on transient receptor potential (TRP) channel activity, as these channels are known targets of various essential oil constituents. Flower (MEO<sub>Fl</sub>) and leaf (MEO<sub>Lv</sub>) essential oils were comprised mainly of monoterpenes (43.1% and 21.1%) and oxygenated monoterpenes (54.8% and 77.7%), respectively, with a high abundance of monoterpene hydrocarbons, including <i>p</i>-cymene, γ-terpinene, α-terpinene, and α-thujene. Major oxygenated monoterpenes of MEO<sub>Fl</sub> and MEO<sub>Lv</sub> included carvacrol and thymol. Both MEO<sub>Fl</sub> and MEO<sub>Lv</sub> stimulated a transient increase in intracellular free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) in TRPA1 but not in TRPV1 or TRPV4-transfected cells, with MEO<sub>Lv</sub> being much more effective than MEO<sub>Fl</sub>. Furthermore, the pure monoterpenes carvacrol, thymol, and β-myrcene activated TRPA1 but not the TRPV1 or TRPV4 channels, suggesting that these compounds represented the TRPA1-activating components of <i>M. fistulosa</i> essential oils. The transient increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> induced by MEO<sub>Fl</sub>/MEO<sub>Lv</sub>, carvacrol, β-myrcene, and thymol in TRPA1-transfected cells was blocked by a selective TRPA1 antagonist, HC-030031. Although carvacrol and thymol have been reported previously to activate the TRPA1 channels, this is the first report to show that β-myrcene is also a TRPA1 channel agonist. Finally, molecular modeling studies showed a substantial similarity between the docking poses of carvacrol, thymol, and β-myrcene in the binding site of human TRPA1. Thus, our results provide a cellular and molecular basis to explain at least part of the therapeutic properties of these essential oils, laying the foundation for prospective pharmacological studies involving TRP ion channels."

      "The cannabis plant (<i>Cannabis sativa</i> L.) produces an estimated 545 chemical compounds of different biogenetic classes. In addition to economic value, many of these phytochemicals have medicinal and physiological activity. The plant is most popularly known for its two most-prominent and most-studied secondary metabolites-Δ<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ<sup>9</sup>-THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). Both Δ<sup>9</sup>-THC and CBD have a wide therapeutic window across many ailments and form part of a class of secondary metabolites called cannabinoids-of which approximately over 104 exist. This review will focus on non-cannabinoid metabolites of <i>Cannabis sativa</i> that also have therapeutic potential, some of which share medicinal properties similar to those of cannabinoids. The most notable of these non-cannabinoid phytochemicals are flavonoids and terpenes. We will also discuss future directions in cannabis research and development of cannabis-based pharmaceuticals. Caflanone, a flavonoid molecule with selective activity against the human viruses including the coronavirus OC43 (HCov-OC43) that is responsible for COVID-19, and certain cancers, is one of the most promising non-cannabinoid molecules that is being advanced into clinical trials. As validated by thousands of years of the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes, vast anecdotal evidence abounds on the medicinal benefits of the plant. These benefits are attributed to the many phytochemicals in this plant, including non-cannabinoids. The most promising non-cannabinoids with potential to alleviate global disease burdens are discussed."

      "Plants from the Rosacea family are rich in natural molecules with beneficial biological properties, and they are widely appreciated and used in the food industry, perfumery, and cosmetics. In this review, we are considering <i>Rosa damascena</i> Mill., <i>Rosa alba</i> L., <i>Rosa centifolia</i> L., and <i>Rosa gallica</i> L. as raw materials important for producing commercial products, analyzing and comparing the main biological activities of their essential oils, hydrolates, and extracts. A literature search was performed to find materials describing (i) botanical characteristics; (ii) the phytochemical profile; and (iii) biological properties of the essential oil sand extracts of these so called \"old roses\" that are cultivated in Bulgaria, Turkey, India, and the Middle East. The information used is from databases PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar. Roses have beneficial healing properties due to their richness of beneficial components, the secondary metabolites as flavonoids (e.g., flavones, flavonols, anthocyanins), fragrant components (essential oils, e.g., monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes), and hydrolysable and condensed tannins. Rose essential oils and extracts with their therapeutic properties-as respiratory antiseptics, anti-inflammatories, mucolytics, expectorants, decongestants, and antioxidants-are able to act as symptomatic prophylactics and drugs, and in this way alleviate dramatic sufferings during severe diseases."

      "In this literature review, we present the main scientific findings on the antifungal activity of essential oils (EOs) applicable for a new drug formulation to treat oral candidiasis. Seven literature databases were systematically searched for eligible in vitro and clinical trials. Selected articles were screened for biological activity, botanical species, phytochemical composition, study design, and methodological quality. A total of 26 articles were included in the review, of which 21 were in vitro studies and 5 clinical trials. The most promising EOs were obtained from <i>Allium tubeorosum</i>, <i>Cinnamomum cassia</i>, <i>Cinnamomum zeylanicum</i>, and <i>Coriandrum sativum</i> L. Among the phytochemicals, citral and thymol were the most active. Clinical trials indicated that the EOs from <i>Pelargonium graveolens</i> and <i>Zataria multiflora</i> are potentially effective to treat oral candidiasis. Further nonclinical and clinical studies with these EO are warranted to determine their potential use and safety for the treatment of oral candidiasis."

      "Essential oils (EOs) have been utilized as a growth inhibitor of microorganisms. This study was aimed to recognize the composition, antioxidative‎, antibacterial‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎, and time-kill activities of <i>Origanum vulgare</i>, <i>Zataria multiflora</i>, <i>Syzygium aromaticum</i>; and <i>Cinnamomum verum</i> EOs against <i>Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli</i> O157:H7, <i>Shewanella</i> <i>putrefaciens</i> and <i>Pseudomonas fluorescens</i>. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to determine the chemical composition of EOs. Disc diffusion, minimum inhibitory concentration, minimum bactericidal concentration, and time-kill methods were used to determine the antibacterial ‎‎activity of EOs. The antioxidative ‎ activity of EOs were determined by 2, 20-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging and ferric reducing antioxidative ‎ power methods. All EOs exhibited antibacterial ‎‎activity, however, <i>Z. multiflora</i> EO was the most effective followed by <i>O. vulgare</i> EO<i>.</i> The lowest antibacterial‎‎‎‎‎ activity was observed in <i>C. verum</i> EO. The most sensitive among tested bacteria to <i>Z. multiflora</i> and <i>O. vulgare</i> EOs was <i>E. coli</i> O157:H7 and to <i>S. aromaticum</i>; and <i>C. verum</i> EOs were <i>S. putrefaciens</i> and <i>P. fluorescens</i>, respectively<i>.</i> <i>Z. multiflora</i> and <i>O. vulgare</i> EOs were able to kill 85.00% and 80.00% of the <i>E. coli</i> O157: H7 and <i>S.</i> <i>putrefaciens</i> cells in 4 hr, respectively. The highest antioxidative ‎activity was observed in <i>Z. multiflora</i> EO. The tested EOs showed the highest antioxidative ‎activity at a concentration of 2.00 g L<sup>-1</sup>. Ferric reducing antioxidant power value of <i>Z. multiflora, O. vulgare</i>, <i>S. aromaticum</i> and <i>C. verum</i> was 2.01 ± 0.03, 1.47 ± 0.04, 1.01 ± 0.03, and 0.66 ± 0.34, respectively. High concentrations of tested EOs showed a decrease in antioxidative ‎ activity."

      "The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the antioxidant and antibacterial activities of essential oil isolated from <i>Tetraclinis articulata</i> (Vahl) leaves, Masters originating in Morocco (Benslimane Region, Atlantic-influenced plain). The analysis of the major compounds of essential oil was performed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, and this oil is dominated by bornyl acetate (35.05%), camphor (11.17%), and <i>α</i>-pinene (10.84%). The antioxidant properties were evaluated by the test of the radical trap 2,2-diphényl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), and the antimicrobial activity of <i>T</i>. <i>articulata</i> essential oil was tested against clinical isolates of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, and <i>Escherichia coli</i> which have been inhibited from the 25 <i>μ</i>g/mL."

      "In tropical rainforests, access to and availability of natural resources are vital for the dietary diversity and food security of forest-dwelling societies. In the Congo Basin, these are challenged by the increasing exploitation of forests for bushmeat, commercial hardwood, mining, and large-scale agriculture. In this context, a balanced approach is needed between the pressures from forest exploitation, non-timber forest product trade and the livelihood and dietary behavior of rural communities. While there is a general positive association between tree cover and dietary diversity, the complex biocultural interactions between tropical forest food resources and the communities they sustain are still understudied. This research focuses on the knowledge and use of wild food plants by the forest-dwelling Baka people in southeast Cameroon. By using two different sets of methods, namely ex-situ interviews and in-situ surveys, we collected ethnographic and ethnobotanical data in two Baka settlements and explored the diversity of wild edible plants known, the frequency of their consumption, and potential conflicts between local diet and commercial trade in forest resources. Within a single Baka population, we showed that the in-situ walk-in-the-woods method resulted in more detailed information on wild food plant knowledge and use frequency than the ex-situ methods of freelisting and dietary recalls. Our in-situ method yielded 91 wild edible species, much more than the ex-situ freelisting interviews (38 spp.) and dietary recalls (12 spp.). Our results suggest that studies that are based only on ex-situ interviews may underestimate the importance of wild food plants for local communities. We discuss the limitations and strengths of these different methods for investigating the diversity of wild food plant knowledge and uses. Our analysis shows that future studies on wild food plants would profit from a mixed approach that combines in-situ and ex-situ methods."

      "The plant kingdom is a rich source of health-promoting compounds and has always played a fundamental role in the isolation, identification, and modification of compounds able to perform several properties on live organisms. Among them, the so-called \"antioxidants\" have a major potentiality to increase human wellness. Antioxidants are important components in the signaling and defense mechanisms in some plants, where they are precursors of compounds of greater complexity, the modulator of plant growth, and the defensive system against pathogenic organisms and predators. The extraordinary variety of chemical structure and substitution present in the different plant antioxidants make them an inestimable source of interesting compounds, with the ability to counter reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) and to stimulate the activation of signal cascade inside the cells. The mechanisms by which antioxidants detoxify these dangerous compounds are complex and involve either direct or indirect interaction with radicals. Antioxidants inhibit or quench free radical reactions mainly based on their reducing capacity or hydrogen atom-donating capacity, their solubility, and chelating properties. Moreover, their ability to modulate key metabolic enzymes and activate/block gene transcription also has remarkable importance."

      "Cold-pressed oil is one of the healthiest plant extracts, but its use is limited only in some kinds of plants. Therefore, we aimed to investigate some potential cold-pressed oils with attractive fatty acid profiles and high amounts of functional phytochemicals. Fifty cold-pressed plant oils were prepared from various plant materials in Thailand, in which some of them were from uncommon or unattended plant materials. The oils included were nut oils (n = 9), pseudo-cereal oils (n = 9), legume oils (n = 3), amaranth oils (n = 3), marrow seed oils (n = 8), cruciferous seed oils (n = 7), and leafy green seed oils (n = 11). Gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry (GC-MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) were employed to analyze fatty acid profile and five functional phytochemicals (e.g., phytosterols, cholecalciferol, and squalene). Saturated fatty acids were detected around 7.87-36.04%, monounsaturated fatty acids 10.17-80.25%, and polyunsaturated fatty acids nondetectable (ND)-78.25%, phytosterols 663-15123 μg g<sup>-1</sup>, squalene 265-5979 μg g<sup>-1</sup>, and cholecalciferol ND-1287.75 μg g<sup>-1</sup>. The study showed chemical characteristic of the analyzed oils: some contained good fatty acid composition and some were rich in functional phytochemical content. Among the obtained oils, marrow seed oils are a good source of phytosterol, cholecalciferol, and linoleic acid. Pseudo-cereal oils are rich in squalene and linolenic acid. Legume oils are rich in phytosterols and oleic acid. Besides, principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to identify the significance of oils that share compositional similarity (e.g., the samples from pseudo-cereal oil were found on the lower side of the PCA space, which separated them from marrow and leafy green seed oils distributed on the upper part of the plot). In summary, the qualitative and quantitative data would provide a good foundation for further application or selection of those plant oils for health purposes."

      "<i>Psidium</i> (Myrtaceae) comprises approximately 266 species, distributed in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. <i>Psidium</i> taxa have great ecological, economic, and medicinal relevance due to their essential oils' chemical diversity and biological potential. This review reports 18 <i>Psidium</i> species growing around the world and the chemical and biological properties of their essential oils. Chemically, 110 oil records are reported with significant variability of volatile constituents, according to their seasonality and collection sites. Monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes with acyclic (C<sub>10</sub> and C<sub>15</sub>), <i>p</i>-menthane, pinane, bisabolane, germacrane, caryophyllane, cadinane, and aromadendrane skeleton-types, were the primary constituents. The essential oils showed various biological activities, including antioxidant, antifungal, antibacterial, phytotoxic, larvicidal, anti-inflammatory, and cytotoxic properties. This review contributes to the <i>Psidium</i> species rational and economic exploration as natural sources to produce new drugs."

      "<h4>Aim</h4>The study investigated the chemical composition, antioxidant content, and antioxidant activity of <i>Thymus vulgaris</i> honey (TVH) and <i>Origanum vulgare</i> essential oil (OVEO) and their mixture effect on carbon tetrachloride (CCl<sub>4</sub>)-induced toxicity.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>The study conducted physicochemical characterization and chemical analysis of TVH and OVEO with the use of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC). The antioxidant activity of TVH and OVEO was done with the use of 1,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity. The study used nine groups of rats to investigate the effect of TVH, OVEO, and a mixture of TVH and OVEO (HEM) on CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced toxicity. Intraperitoneal injection of CCl<sub>4</sub> (1 mL/100 g) was used to induce toxicity. The doses of TVH and OVEO were 1 mg/kg.b.wt, and 50 mg/kg.b.wt, respectively. HEM contains TVH (1 mg/kg.b.wt) and OVEO (50 mg/kg.b.wt).<h4>Results</h4>TVH has a high content of phenols, flavonoids, and flavanols. HPLC analysis showed that TVH contains, for the 1<sup>st</sup> time, epicatechin gallate, and at a high concentration. OVEO includes a high percentage of carvacrol and thymol. With the use of DPPH, OVEO was more potent than TVH. CCl<sub>4</sub> caused significant liver and kidney damage and lipid disorders, which were alleviated by HVT, OVEO, and HEM. HVT was more potent than OVEO (p<0.05), and HEM was more potent than HVT and OVEO (p<0.05).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The study identified high content of epicatechin gallate for the 1<sup>st</sup> time in TVH, and OVEO contains a high percentage of thymol and carvacrol. Epicatechin gallate might be useful as a marker for TVH. Mixing OVEO and TVH significantly potentiated their protection against CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced liver and kidney toxicity."

      "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer of the myeloid lineage of blood cells, and treatment for AML is lengthy and can be very expensive. Medicinal plants and their bioactive molecules are potential candidates for improving human health. In this work, we studied the effect of <i>Ptychotis verticillata</i> (PV) essential oil and its derivatives, carvacrol and thymol, in AML cell lines. We demonstrated that a combination of carvacrol and thymol induced tumor cell death with low toxicity on normal cells. Mechanistically, we highlighted that different molecular pathways, including apoptosis, oxidative, reticular stress, autophagy, and necrosis, are implicated in this potential synergistic effect. Using quantitative RT-PCR, Western blotting, and apoptosis inhibitors, we showed that cell death induced by the carvacrol and thymol combination is caspase-dependent in the HL60 cell line and caspase-independent in the other cell lines tested. Further investigations should focus on improving the manufacturing of these compounds and understanding their anti-tumoral mechanisms of action. These efforts will lead to an increase in the efficiency of the oncotherapy strategy regarding AML."

      "<h4>Abstract</h4>The management of house fly, <i>Musca domestica</i> has become immensely important to prevent epidemics of many detrimental diseases. In view of this objective, the present study demonstrates the efficacy of lemongrass (LG) and tea tree essential oils (TTEOs) against <i>M. domestica</i>. The TTEO proved to be more lethal against larvae and adults of <i>M. domestica</i> depicting an LC<sub>50</sub> at 14.88 mg/ dm<sup>3</sup> which was 17.19 mg/ dm<sup>3</sup> for LGEO. In contrast, pupicidal effect of LGEO was much higher (LD<sub>50</sub>, 14.49 µl/0.25L) as compared to TTEO. The LGEO drastically reduced the total body sugar, glycogen and protein contents by 3.29, 2.95 and 7.56 fold, respectively, contrasting with high influence of TTEO on lipid content of the late 3rd instar larvae. A considerable reduction in gut enzymes secretion was observed due to treatment of EOs thereby altering gut physiology of the insect. Moreover, significant inhibition of acetylcholine esterase (AchE) was also observed with LGEO at LC<sub>50</sub> concentration (5.33 mg/ml) inhibiting insect neurotransmission. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) analysis of the LGEO showed 12 major compounds dominated by Citral whereas TTEO contained only 5 major compounds. Further analysis by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) revealed distortion and shrinkage of larval bodies caused by the treatment of EOs. These overall observations brand LG and TT-EOs as potential organic-insecticides against <i>M. domestica</i>.<h4>Graphic abstract</h4><h4>Supplementary information</h4>The online version of this article (10.1007/s40011-020-01220-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users."

      "<h4>Background</h4>Asarum heterotropides Fr. Schmidt var. mandshuricum (Maxim.) Kitag. is an important medicinal and industrial plant, which is used in the treatment of various diseases. The main bioactive ingredient is the volatile oil having more than 82 identified components of which methyleugenol, safrole, myristicin, and toluene account for about 70% of the total volume. As a sciophyte plant, the amount of light it absorbs through leaves is an important factor for growth and metabolism.<h4>Results</h4>We grew Asarum plants under full, 50, 28, and 12% sunlight conditions to investigate the effect of different light irradiances on the four major volatile oil components. We employed de novo transcriptome sequencing to understand the transcriptional behavior of Asarum leaves regarding the biosynthetic pathways of the four volatile oil components, photosynthesis and biomass accumulation, and hormone signaling. Our results demonstrated that the increasing light conditions promoted higher percent of the four components. Under full sunlight conditions, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase and cytochrome p450719As were upregulated and led the increased methyleugenol, safrole, and myristicin. The transcriptomic data also showed that Asarum leaves, under full sunlight conditions, adjust their photosynthesis-antenna proteins as a photoprotective response with the help of carotenoids. Plant hormone-signaling related genes were also differentially expressed between full sunlight and low light conditions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>High light induces accumulation of major bioactive ingredients A. heterotropides volatile oil and this is ascribed to upregulation of key genes such as cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase and cytochrome p450719As. The transcriptome data presented here lays the foundation of further understanding of light responses in sciophytes and provides guidance for increasing bioactive molecules in Asarum."

      "Rye (<i>Secale cereale</i> L.) is one of the most important cereal crops in Eastern and Northern Europe, showing better tolerance to environmental stress factors compared to wheat and triticale. Plant response to the crude oil-polluted soil depends on plant species, oil concentration, time of exposure, etc. The current study is aimed at investigating the growth, oxidative stress and the response of antioxidative system of two rye varieties (Krona and Valdai) cultivated on crude oil-contaminated soils at different concentrations (1.5, 3.0, 6.0, and 12.0%). Inhibition of rye growth was observed at crude oil concentrations of above 3% for above-ground plant parts and of above 1.5% for roots. A decrease in content of chlorophyll <i>a</i> and total chlorophylls in Krona variety was detected at 1.5% oil concentration in soil and in Valdai variety at 3% oil concentration. Compared with the control, the content of malondialdehyde was significantly increased in the Krona variety at 3% oil concentration and in Valdai variety at 6% oil concentration. The crude oil-induced oxidative stress was minimized in rye plants by the enhanced contents of low-molecular antioxidants (proline, non-protein thiols, ascorbic acid, phenolic compounds) and activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, and glutathione peroxidase. The strongest positive correlation was detected between the content of malondialdehyde and contents of proline (r = 0.89-0.95, <i>p</i> ≤ 0.05) and phenolic compounds (r = 0.90-0.94, <i>p</i> ≤ 0.05) as well as superoxide dismutase activity (r = 0.81-0.90, <i>p</i> ≤ 0.05). Based on the results of a comprehensive analysis of growth and biochemical parameters and of the cluster analysis, Valdai variety proved to be more resistant to oil pollution. Due to this, Valdai variety is considered to be a promising rye variety for cultivation on moderately oil-polluted soils in order to decontaminate them. At the same time, it is necessary to conduct further studies aimed at investigating oil transformation processes in the soil-rye system, which would make it possible to determine the efficiency of using this cereal for soil remediation."

      "The rice weevil (<i>Sitophilus oryzae</i>) is a pest of stored grain products such as rice, wheat, and corn. Essential oils represent a green environmentally-friendly alternative to synthetic pesticides for controlling stored-product insect pests. <i>Launaea taraxacifolia</i> is a leafy vegetable plant found in several parts of Nigeria. The leaves are eaten either fresh as a salad or cooked as a sauce. The essential oil obtained from fresh leaves of <i>L. taraxacifolia</i> was obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Twenty-nine compounds were identified, accounting for 100% of the oil composition. The major component classes were monoterpene hydrocarbons (78.1%), followed by oxygenated monoterpenoids (16.2%), sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (2.1%), oxygenated sesquiterpenoids (0.3%), and non-terpenoid derivatives (3.3%). The leaf essential oil was dominated by monoterpene hydrocarbons including limonene (48.8%), sabinene (18.8%), and (<i>E</i>)-β-ocimene (4.6%), along with the monoterpenoid aldehyde citronellal (11.0%). The contact insecticidal activity of <i>L. taraxacifolia</i> essential oil against <i>Sitophilus oryzae</i> was carried out; median lethal concentration (LC<sub>50</sub>) values of topical exposure of <i>L. taraxacifolia</i> essential oil were assessed over a 120-h period. The LC<sub>50</sub> values ranged from 54.38 μL/mL (24 h) to 10.10 µL/mL (120 h). The insecticidal activity of the <i>L. taraxacifolia</i> essential oil can be attributed to major components limonene (48.8%), sabinene (18.8%), and citronellal (11.0%), as well as potential synergistic action of the essential oil components. This result showed <i>L. taraxacifolia</i> essential oil may be considered as a useful alternative to synthetic insecticides."

      "<h4>Purpose</h4>Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is an opportunistic fungal infection that adversely affects a woman's health, due to unpleasant symptoms, therapeutic challenges, and the emergence of resistant strains. The association of natural products and nanotechnology is important to improve the antifungal potential of medicinal plants. We aimed to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo anti-<i>Candida albicans</i> activity of unloaded (EO) and loaded (ME+EO) essential oil of <i>Cymbopogon nardus</i> in the microemulsion (ME).<h4>Methods</h4>The chemical analysis of the EO was performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The ME and ME+EO were characterized by scattering, zeta potential, polarized light microscopy, rheological assays, mucoadhesiveness and transmission electronic microscopy. The in vitro antifungal activity of the EO and ME+EO were evaluated by microdilution technique. The toxicity of EO and ME+EO was analyzed on human cell line HaCat and using alternative model assay with <i>Artemia salina</i>. The experimental in vivo VVC was performed in female mice (C57BL/6).<h4>Results</h4>The main compounds of the EO were found to be citronellal, geranial, geraniol, citronellol, and neral. The formulations exhibited suitable size, homogeneity, negative charge, isotropic behavior, highly organized structure, and pseudoplastic behavior, for vaginal application. TEM photomicrographs showed possible EO droplets inside the spherical structures. The EO, when loaded into the ME, exhibited an improvement in its antifungal action against <i>C. albicans</i>. The EO was not toxic against brine shrimp nauplii. An in vivo VVC assay showed that the use of the ME significantly improved the action of the EO, since only the ME+EO promoted the eradication of the fungal vaginal infection on the third day of treatment.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The EO and ME+EO are promising alternatives for the control of fungal infections caused by <i>C. albicans</i>, once the use of nanotechnology significantly improved the antifungal action of the EO, especially in an in vivo model of VVC."

      "<i>Heracleum persicum</i>, commonly named Persian hogweed, is a principal native medicinal plant in Iran. Collecting <i>H. persicum</i> at the most appropriate growing stage is the key factor to achieve the high phytochemical quality to meet consumer's needs. In the present experiment, the aerial parts of this plant were harvested at up to six different developmental stages during the growing season to determine the phytochemical profiles. Our results indicated that the highest essential oil content was obtained in the mid-mature seed stage (3.5%). The most elevated extract content was recorded in the floral budding stage (10.4%). In the vegetative stage, limonene (18.1%), in floral budding stage, caryophyllene (14.1%), anethole (14.6%), and β-bisabolene (12.7%), in the full flowering stage, myristicin (15.0%), and hexyl butyrate (9.1%), in the early development of seeds stage, hexyl butyrate (32.1%), and octyl acetate (11.7%), in the mid-mature seeds stage hexyl butyrate (38.8%), octyl acetate (14.5%), in the late-mature/ripe seeds stage, hexyl butyrate (23.6%), and octyl acetate (10.5%) are recorded as the main components. The highest phenolic acids content was obtained in the floral budding stage (287.40 mg/g dried extract). The analysis of phenolic acids demonstrated cinnamic acid (8.0-225.3 mg/g extract), p-coumaric acid (1.7-39.2 mg/g extract), p-hydroxybenzoic acid (0.8-16.8 mg/g extract), and ferulic acid (2.4-15.8 mg/g extract) as the main phenolic acids. Cinnamic acid was found as the major phenolic compound in the vegetative stage following by floral budding, the full flowering stage, the early development of seeds, and late-mature/ripe seeds stages. P-coumaric acid was the most abundant phenolic compounds in the mid-mature seeds stage. In this regard, the harvest time of <i>H. persicum</i> aerial parts can be selected to achieve the highest secondary metabolites of interest. The results of this study can be used as a guideline for grower to obtain the highest possible amount of desirable metabolites, beneficial in both food and pharmaceutical industries as well as their undeniable economical benefits."

      "Phytochemical research based on ethnopharmacology is gaining interest in industries such as functional food, nutraceuticals, cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries. Plants and plant extracts are a rich source of bioactive secondary metabolites. These compounds are often involved in plant protection against biotic or abiotic stresses. The exploitation of available technologies should be oriented and intensified to extend and enhance the continued usefulness of the plants as renewable sources of chemicals, especially medicinal compounds. This current contribution is focused on extraction and analytical techniques for their isolation from the oregano species, their characterization and their potential antioxidative, as well as their antimicrobial, antifungal and anticarcinogenic properties. The work is structured rendering to the different steps involved in the research; starting with extraction and sample preparation, followed by discussing the analytical techniques employed for the isolation and identification of compound/s responsible for the biological activity and methods and techniques for biological activity assessment."

      "Mango (<i>Mangifera indica</i> L.), known as the king of fruits, has an attractive taste and fragrance and high nutritional value. Mango is commercially important in India, where ~55% of the global crop is produced. The fruit has three main parts: pulp, peel, and kernel. The pulp is the most-consumed part, while the peel and kernel are usually discarded. Mango pulp is a source of a variety of reducing sugars, amino acids, aromatic compounds, and functional compounds, such as pectin, vitamins, anthocyanins, and polyphenols. Mango processing generates peels and kernels as bio-wastes, though they also have nutraceutical significance. Functional compounds in the peel, including protocatechuic acids, mangiferin and β-carotene are known for their antimicrobial, anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-carcinogenic properties. The mango kernel has higher antioxidant and polyphenolic contents than the pulp and peel and is used for oil extraction; it's possible usage in combination with corn and wheat flour in preparing nutraceuticals is being increasingly emphasized. This review aims to provide nutraceutical and pharmacological information on all three parts of mango to help understand the defense mechanisms of its functional constituents, and the appropriate use of mangoes to enhance our nutrition and health."

      "Green synthesis of metal nanoparticles from medicinal plants has provided a broad scope in biomedical research and functional food formulations due to low toxicity. <i>Dendropanax morbifera</i> (DM) is a versatile traditional medicine used for various inflammatory diseases due to its extensive antioxidant activity. We investigated DM as a natural capping agent for Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions and coloaded it with tryptophan for its penetration and antiobesity behavior. DM zinc oxide nanoparticles (DM-ZnO NPs) were prepared and then entrapped with tryptophan (DM-ZnO-Try nanoemulsion (NE)) for stable formulation using the O/W nanoemulsion method. The hydrodynamic sizes measured by dynamic light scattering for DM-ZnO NPs and DM-ZnO-Try NE are about 146.26 ± 3.31 and 151.16 ± 3.59 nm, respectively. TEM and SEM reveal its morphology. In vitro analysis on both NPs and NE was non-toxic to RAW 264.7 and 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell line. It significantly reduced the accumulated lipids through lipolysis performed at 10 ug/mL in 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells. NE suppresses the differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes and lowers triglycerides. Further, the substantial reduction of lipid content is evident with Oil Red O staining and OD measurement. In this present study, the synergetic effect of DM-ZnO NPs and tryptophan is reported, which provides a way for more detailed research on its efficacy for obesity and obesity-associated disorders."

      "Essential oils (EOs) are known to have varying degrees of antimicrobial properties that are mainly due to the presence of bioactive compounds. These include antiviral, nematicidal, antifungal, insecticidal and antioxidant properties. This review highlights the potential of EOs and their compounds for application as antifungal agents for the treatment of skin diseases via conventional and nonconventional approaches. A search was conducted using three databases (Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar), and all relevant articles from the period of 2010-2020 that are freely available in English were extracted. In our findings, EOs with a high percentage of monoterpenes showed strong ability as potential antifungal agents. <i>Lavandula</i> sp., <i>Salvia</i> sp., <i>Thymus</i> sp., <i>Citrus</i> sp., and <i>Cymbopogon</i> sp. were among the various species found to show excellent antifungal properties against various skin diseases. Some researchers developed advanced formulations such as gel, semi-solid, and ointment bases to further evaluate the effectiveness of EOs as antifungal agents. To date, most studies on the application of EOs as antifungal agents were performed using in vitro techniques, and only a limited number pursued in vivo and intervention-based research."

      "Natural rubber is an essential material, especially for plane and truck tyres but also for medical gloves. Asia ranks first in the production of natural rubber, of which the <i>Hevea</i> tree is currently the sole source. However, it is anticipated that this source alone will not be able to fulfill the growing demand. Guayule, a shrub native to northern Mexico and southern United States, may also contribute. This plant not only contains polyisoprene, but also resin, a mixture of lipids and terpenoids. This review summarizes various aspects of this plant, from the usage history, botanical description, geographical distribution and cultivation practices, down to polyisoprene and resin biosynthesis including their distribution within the plant and molecular composition. Finally, the main processes yielding dry rubber or latex are depicted, as well as the properties of the various extracts along with economic considerations. The aim is to provide a wide picture of current knowledge available about this promising crop, a good feedstock candidate for a multiple-product biorefinery."

      "Plastic, usually derived from non-renewable sources, is among the most used materials in food packaging. Despite its barrier properties, plastic packaging has a recycling rate below the ideal and its accumulation in the environment leads to environmental issues. One of the solutions approached to minimize this impact is the development of food packaging materials made from polymers from renewable sources that, in addition to being biodegradable, can also be edible. Different biopolymers from agricultural renewable sources such as gelatin, whey protein, starch, chitosan, alginate and pectin, among other, have been analyzed for the development of biodegradable films. Moreover, these films can serve as vehicles for transporting bioactive compounds, extending their applicability as bioactive, edible, compostable and biodegradable films. Biopolymer films incorporated with plant-derived bioactive compounds have become an interesting area of research. The interaction between environment-friendly biopolymers and bioactive compounds improves functionality. In addition to interfering with thermal, mechanical and barrier properties of films, depending on the properties of the bioactive compounds, new characteristics are attributed to films, such as antimicrobial and antioxidant properties, color and innovative flavors. This review compiles information on agro-based biopolymers and plant-derived bioactive compounds used in the production of bioactive films. Particular emphasis has been given to the methods used for incorporating bioactive compounds from plant-derived into films and their influence on the functional properties of biopolymer films. Some limitations to be overcome for future advances are also briefly summarized. This review will benefit future prospects for exploring innovative methods of incorporating plant-derived bioactive compounds into films made from agricultural polymers."

      "Spraying of defoliant can promote centralized defoliation of cotton and advance maturity to facilitate harvesting. Modern pesticide application equipment includes plant protection unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are used widely for spraying defoliants. However, commonly used defoliant formulations are mainly suspension concentrates and water-dispersible granules, which need to be diluted with water when used. These are not suitable for plant protection UAVs with limited load capacity, especially in arid areas such as Xinjiang, China. Therefore, we prepared a thidiazuron·diuron ultra-low-volume (ULV) spray, which can be used directly without dilution in water. We found that ULV sprays had better wettability than the commercially available suspension concentrate, could quickly wet cotton leaves and spread fully. The volatilization rate was lower. ULV sprays also showed better atomization performance and more uniform droplet distribution than the commercially available suspension concentrate. At a dosage of 4.50-9.00 L/ha, the coverage rate on cotton leaves was 0.85-4.15% and droplet deposition densities were 15.63-42.57 pcs/cm<sup>2</sup>; defoliation rate and spitting rate were also greater than those of the reference product. This study could be contributed to the development of special pesticide formulations suitable for UAVs."

      "Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferases (GPATs) play an important role in glycerolipid biosynthesis, and are mainly involved in oil production, flower development, and stress response. However, their roles in regulating plant height remain unreported. Here, we report that Arabidopsis GPAT1 is involved in the regulation of plant height. GUS assay and qRT-PCR analysis in Arabidopsis showed that <i>GPAT1</i> is highly expressed in flowers, siliques, and seeds. A loss of function mutation in <i>GPAT1</i> was shown to decrease seed yield but increase plant height through enhanced cell length. Transcriptomic and qRT-PCR data revealed that the expression levels of genes related to gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis and signaling, as well as those of cell wall organization and biogenesis, were significantly upregulated. These led to cell length elongation, and thus, an increase in plant height. Together, our data suggest that knockout of <i>GPAT1</i> impairs glycerolipid metabolism in Arabidopsis, leading to reduced seed yield, but promotes the biosynthesis of GA, which ultimately enhances plant height. This study provides new evidence on the interplay between lipid and hormone metabolism in the regulation of plant height."

      "Terpenes are the primary constituents of essential oils and are responsible for the aroma characteristics of cannabis. Together with the cannabinoids, terpenes illustrate synergic and/or entourage effect and their interactions have only been speculated in for the last few decades. Hundreds of terpenes are identified that allude to cannabis sensory attributes, contributing largely to the consumer's experiences and market price. They also enhance many therapeutic benefits, especially as aromatherapy. To shed light on the importance of terpenes in the cannabis industry, the purpose of this review is to morphologically describe sources of cannabis terpenes and to explain the biosynthesis and diversity of terpene profiles in different cannabis chemovars."

      "<h4>Background</h4>There is a worldwide interest in the use of Cannabis sativa for biomedicine purposes. Cannabis has ethnomedicinal usage as a natural medicine in Bangladesh and cultivated during the British Empire period for revenues.<h4>Objective</h4>Folk medicine practitioners (FMPs) from different districts of Bangladesh have been using Cannabis sativa, but until now there have not been any compiled studies particularly regarding this practice. Hence, this review is an effort to retrieve the traditional usage of Cannabis sativa as a phytomedicine from published ethnomedicinal studies.<h4>Methods and materials</h4>Information was searched by using the search terms \"ethnomedicinal Cannabis sativa and Bangladesh\"; \"Bangladesh cannabaceae and ethnomedicinal survey\"; \"ganja, bhang and folk medicine Bangladesh\"; \"tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabinoid and therapeutic, clinical trial\"; and \"cannabis and pharmacological/biological\" and retrieved from ethnobotanical articles available on PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, and Google Scholar databases. A search of the relevant scientific literature also was conducted to assess the efficacy of the ethnomedicinal usage of Cannabis sativa.<h4>Results</h4>While reviewing over 200 ethnomedicinal plants' survey articles, we found that FMPs of Bangladesh from 12 different districts used Cannabis sativa to treat cited ailments like sleep-associated problems (n=5), neuropsychiatric and CNS problems (n=5), and infections and respiratory problems (n=5) followed by rheumatism, gastrointestinal, gynecological (n=4 each), cancer, sexual, and other ailments including hypertension, headache, itch, increases bile secretion, abortifacient, dandruff, fever, and urinary problems (n=1 each). There are a total of 15 formulations identified from the 11 out of 18 ethnomedicinal plant survey reports. The leaf was the main plant part used (53.8%), followed by root (23%), seed (7.7%) and flower, inflorescence, resin, and all parts 3.8% respectively.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Sales and cultivation of Cannabis are illegal at present in Bangladesh, but the use of Cannabis sativa as a natural phytomedicine has been practiced traditionally by folk medicine practitioners of Bangladesh for many years and validated through relevant pharmacological justification. Although Cannabis sativa possesses ethnomedicinal properties in the folk medicine of Bangladesh, it is, furthermore, needed to conduct biological research to consolidate pharmacological justification about the prospects and challenges of Cannabis and cannabinoids' use in Bangladesh as safer biomedicine in the future."

      "Essential oils of sweet lime peel, a waste by-product in the juice industry, were extracted using the vacuum assisted solvent free microwave extraction (VASFME) method. The effects of microwave output power (500-1000 W) and extraction time (20-30 min) on the essential oils yield and antimicrobial property were investigated. Optimal conditions were observed at 797.844 W microwave output power and 30 min extraction time. The essential oils yield and antimicrobial property under these conditions were 0.792 ± 0.03% and 18.25 ± 1.45 mm, respectively, which agrees with the predicted values of 0.757% and 16.50 mm. The essential oils were extracted at optimized conditions and analyzed through GCMS for compound identification. A total of 49 compounds were identified, with limonene content (43.47%) being the highest among all sweet lime peel oil compounds. Moreover, the sweet lime peels were subjected to ultrasound pre-treatment before microwave extraction. The ultrasound pre-treatment helped to increase the essential oils yield from 0.84 to 1.06% as the treatment time increased from 30 to 90 min. The increase in yield was 37.66% more compared to VASFME at 90 min treatment time."

      "Metabolic diseases like diabetes mellitus or dyslipidemia have a complex etiology characterized by the interference of genetic predisposition and environmental factors like diet or lifestyle. Over time they can cause significant vascular complications, leading to dysfunction or failure of key organs (brain, heart), with possible fatal consequences or a severe reduction of life quality. Although current authorized drugs may successfully control blood glucose or cholesterol level, their use is often associated with severe side effects, therefore the development of new drug candidates is necessary for a better management of metabolic diseases. Among potential new drug sources, aromatic plants rich in essential oils like <i>Melissa officinalis</i> L., <i>Mentha x piperita</i> L., <i>Cuminum cyminum</i> L. or <i>Pistacia lentiscus</i> L. var. <i>chia</i> are very promising due to their diverse chemical composition and multiple mechanisms of action. This review describes a series of recent experimental studies investigating antidiabetic and hypolipemic effects of essential oils extracted from several aromatic plant species with an ethnopharmacological relevance in the Balkan peninsula. The pharmacological models used in the studies together with the putative mechanisms of action of the main constituents are also detailed. The presented data clearly sustain a potential administration of the studied essential oils for the prevention and treatment of metabolic diseases. Further research is needed in order to ascertain the therapeutic importance of these findings."

      "Winter Savory (<i>Satureja montana</i> L.) has been used in traditional medicine and as a spice or natural food preservative in the Mediterranean region for centuries. In this paper, some technological and analytical aspects of the <i>S. montana</i> tinctures development and an evaluation of the essential oil composition are provided. The total phenolic and flavonoid contents and phenolic compounds profile analyzed spectrophotometrically and by high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC), respectively, were evaluated in the developed tinctures. The results showed that the tinctures prepared from the <i>S. montana</i> herb by maceration or remaceration are rich in polyphenols, and there is an influence of the technological factors (particle size and extraction mode) on the total phenolic and flavonoid contents. Caffeic, rosmarinic, and chlorogenic acids, (-)-catechin and rutin were identified in the tinctures using the HPTLC method. <i>p</i>-Thymol (81.79%) revealed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was the predominant compound of the essential oil of this plant. Thus, the high contents of polyphenols and flavonoids in the developed tinctures and <i>p</i>-thymol among the volatile components of the <i>S. montana</i> essential oil could indicate the promising antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of these herbal preparations. The obtained results are a ground for the organization of the manufacture of the <i>S. montana</i> tincture and essential oil with the purpose of performing preclinical studies."

      "The devastating root-knot nematode <i>Meloidogyne incognita</i> can cause severe damage to field and greenhouse crops. Due to high economic losses, alternative products are essential to replace banned or strictly regulated nematicides that affect human health and/or the environment. Garlic based products have been previously investigated as environmentally friendly nematicides and their active substances, diallyl polysulfides exist as formulated nematicides on the market. We tested the garlic-based nematicide NEMguard<sup>®</sup> DE as protective of tomato roots. In vitro evaluation of the lethal concentration (LC) showed strong nematicidal activity with LC<sub>50</sub> of 0.8 mg/mL after 96 h and LC<sub>90</sub> of 1.5 mg/mL. NEMguard<sup>®</sup> DE showed protective effect against <i>M. incognita</i> as a single application in small pots and a second application further reduced root galling, significantly. Large greenhouse trials were carried out in two consecutive years to test single and monthly applications of NEMguard<sup>®</sup> DE. In both years, no controlling effect could be observed on <i>M.</i><i>incognita</i>. We assume that the silt content of the loamy sandy soil used had an effect on the polysulfides, inhibiting their nematicidal effect. We conclude that further experiments are necessary to investigate the nematicidal potential of NEMguard<sup>®</sup> DE under different soil compositions or as a different formulation."

      "Plants can use volatiles for remote suppression of competitors. Mints produce essential oils, which are known to affect the growth of other plants. We used a comparative approach to identify allelopathic compounds from different Mints (genus <i>Mentha</i>, but also including Cat Mint, <i>Nepeta cataria</i>, and Corean Mint, <i>Agastache rugosa</i>, belonging to sisters clades within the <i>Mentheae</i>) using the standard cress germination assay as readout. To understand the mechanism behind this allelopathic effect, we investigated the response of tobacco BY-2 cell lines, expressing GFP-tagged markers for microtubules and actin filaments to these essential oils. Based on the comparison between bioactivity and chemical components, we identified menthone as prime candidate for the allelopathic effect, and confirmed this bioactivity targeted to microtubules experimentally in both, plant cells (tobaccoBY-2), and seedlings (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We could show that menthone disrupted microtubules and induced mortality linked with a rapid permeabilization (less than 15 min) of the plasma membrane. This mortality was elevated in a tubulin marker line, where microtubules are mildly stabilized. Our study paves the way for the development of novel bioherbicides that would be environmentally friendly."

      "A novel chemical profile essential oil, distilled from the aerial parts of <i>Clinopodium taxifolium</i> (Kunth) Govaerts (Lamiaceae), was analysed by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS, qualitative analysis) and Gas Chromatography with Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID, quantitative analysis), with both polar and non-polar stationary phase columns. The chemical composition mostly consisted of sesquiterpenes and sesquiterpenoids (>70%), the main ones being (<i>E</i>)-<i>β</i>-caryophyllene (17.8%), <i>α</i>-copaene (10.5%), <i>β</i>-bourbonene (9.9%), <i>δ</i>-cadinene (6.6%), <i>cis</i>-cadina-1(6),4-diene (6.4%) and germacrene D (4.9%), with the non-polar column. The essential oil was then submitted to enantioselective GC analysis, with a diethyl-<i>tert</i>-butyldimethylsilyl-<i>β</i>-cyclodextrin diluted in PS-086 chiral selector, resulting in the following enantiomeric excesses for the chiral components: (1<i>R</i>,5<i>S</i>)-(-)-<i>α</i>-thujene (67.8%), (1<i>R</i>,5<i>R</i>)-(+)-<i>α</i>-pinene (85.5%), (1<i>S</i>,5<i>S</i>)-(-)-<i>β</i>-pinene (90.0%), (1<i>S</i>,5<i>S</i>)-(-)-sabinene (12.3%), (<i>S</i>)-(-)-limonene (88.1%), (<i>S</i>)-(+)-linalool (32.7%), (<i>R</i>)-(-)-terpinen-4-ol (9.3%), (<i>S</i>)-(-)-<i>α</i>-terpineol (71.2%) and (<i>S</i>)-(-)-germacrene D (89.0%). The inhibition activity against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) of <i>C. taxifolium</i> essential oil was then tested, resulting in selective activity against BChE with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 31.3 ± 3.0 μg/mL (positive control: donepezil, IC<sub>50</sub> = 3.6 μg/mL)."

      "Thymus albicans is an endemic species of the Iberian Peninsula with a vulnerable conservation status. In an attempt to contribute to the valorization of this species, the present study brings new insights on the antifungal and anti-inflammatory mechanism of action of T. albicans essential oil. The antifungal activity of the oil and its major compounds was assessed for the first time against standard and clinically isolated strains of yeasts and filamentous fungi. The effect on the two major virulence factors of Candida albicans (germ tube formation and biofilm disruption) was considered in more detail. At 0.08 μL/mL, the oil inhibited C. albicans germ tube formation by more than 40% and decreased biofilm biomass at MIC values, thus pointing out its antivirulent potential. The anti-inflammatory activity of the essential oil was investigated on LPS-stimulated mouse macrophages (RAW 264.7) by evaluating the levels of several pro-inflammatory mediators, namely nitric oxide (NO), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). T. albicans oil reduced the production of nitrites, a NO derived sub-product, at non-cytotoxic concentrations of 0.32 and 0.64 μL/mL, by 27 and 41%, respectively. In addition, the iNOS protein levels of essential oil pre-treated cells were reduced by 14%. Overall, the high essential oil yield of T. albicans as well as its bioactive effects at concentrations without cytotoxicity, encourage further studies on the potential pharmacological applications of this species. Furthermore, these results raise awareness for the need to preserve endangered species that may hold relevant medicinal value."

      "The use of non-thermal processing technologies has been on the surge due to ever increasing demand for highest quality convenient foods containing the natural taste & flavor and being free of chemical additives and preservatives. Among the various non-thermal processing methods, ultrasound technology has proven to be very valuable. Ultrasound processing, being used alone or in combination with other processing methods, yields significant positive results on the quality of foods, thus has been considered efficacious. Food processes performed under the action of ultrasound are believed to be affected in part by cavitation phenomenon and mass transfer enhancement. It is considered to be an emerging and promising technology and has been applied efficiently in food processing industry for several processes such as freezing, filtration, drying, separation, emulsion, sterilization, and extraction. Various researches have opined that ultrasound leads to an increase in the performance of the process and improves the quality factors of the food. The present paper will discuss the mechanical, chemical and biochemical effects produced by the propagation of high intensity ultrasonic waves through the medium. This review outlines the current knowledge about application of ultrasound in food technology including processing, preservation and extraction. In addition, the several advantages of ultrasound processing, which when combined with other different technologies (such as microwave, supercritical CO<sub>2</sub>, high pressure processing, enzymatic extraction, etc.) are being examined. These include an array of effects such as effective mixing, retention of food characteristics, faster energy and mass transfer, reduced thermal and concentration gradients, effective extraction, increased production, and efficient alternative to conventional techniques. Furthermore, the paper presents the necessary theoretical background and details of the technology, technique, and safety precautions about ultrasound."

      "Mosquito-borne infectious diseases are a persistent problem in tropical regions of the world, including Southeast Asia. Vector control has relied principally on synthetic insecticides, but these have detrimental environmental effects and there is an increasing demand for plant-based agents to control insect pests. Invasive weedy plant species may be able to serve as readily available sources of essential oils, some of which may be useful as larvicidal agents for control of mosquito populations. We hypothesize that members of the genus <i>Conyza</i> (Asteraceae) may produce essential oils that may have mosquito larvicidal properties. The essential oils from the aerial parts of <i>Conyza bonariensis</i>, <i>C. canadensis</i>, and <i>C. sumatrensis</i> were obtained by hydrodistillation, analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and screened for mosquito larvicidal activity against <i>Aedes aegypti</i>, <i>Ae. albopictus</i> and <i>Culex quinquefasciatus</i>. The essential oils of <i>C. canadensis</i> and <i>C. sumatrensis</i>, both rich in limonene (41.5% and 25.5%, respectively), showed notable larvicidal activities against <i>Ae. aegypti</i> (24-h LC<sub>50</sub> = 9.80 and 21.7 μg/mL, respectively) and <i>Ae. albopictus</i> (24-h LC<sub>50</sub> = 18.0 and 19.1 μg/mL, respectively). These two <i>Conyza</i> species may, therefore, serve as sources for alternative, environmentally-benign larvicidal control agents."

      "<h4>Background</h4>Phosphorus (P), in its orthophosphate form (Pi) is an essential macronutrient for oil palm early growth development in which Pi deficiency could later on be reflected in lower biomass production. Application of phosphate rock, a non-renewable resource has been the common practice to increase Pi accessibility and maintain crop productivity in Malaysia. However, high fixation rate of Pi in the native acidic tropical soils has led to excessive utilization of P fertilizers. This has caused serious environmental pollutions and cost increment. Even so, the Pi deficiency response mechanism in oil palm as one of the basic prerequisites for crop improvement remains largely unknown.<h4>Results</h4>Using total RNA extracted from young roots as template, we performed a comparative transcriptome analysis on oil palm responding to 14d and 28d of Pi deprivation treatment and under adequate Pi supply. By using Illumina HiSeq4000 platform, RNA-Seq analysis was successfully conducted on 12 paired-end RNA-Seq libraries and generated more than 1.2 billion of clean reads in total. Transcript abundance estimated by fragments per kilobase per million fragments (FPKM) and differential expression analysis revealed 36 and 252 genes that are differentially regulated in Pi-starved roots at 14d and 28d, respectively. Genes possibly involved in regulating Pi homeostasis, nutrient uptake and transport, hormonal signaling and gene transcription were found among the differentially expressed genes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results showed that the molecular response mechanism underlying Pi starvation in oil palm is complexed and involved multilevel regulation of various sensing and signaling components. This contribution would generate valuable genomic resources in the effort to develop oil palm planting materials that possess Pi-use efficient trait through molecular manipulation and breeding programs."

      "The use pesticide is one of the indispensable means to combat mosquito borne diseases. However, the repeated use of synthetic pesticides has induced resistance in the vector pest along with undesirable impact on the environment. The biodegradability, non-persistent and user's safety are the root cause to prefer plant-derived pesticides to synthetic ones. The botanical based pesticides tend to degrade rapidly under the influence of several environmental factors. For the feasible application as pesticides, the plant products are formulated either as liquid or as purely solid. Despite well-established formulation technology in pesticide delivery, their handling trouble is being ignored. There is difficulty in liquid formulation of pesticide products, as they are prone to splashing and spillage, resulting in contamination, wastage and direct exposure to skin; whereas a solid formulation tends to produce dust. In the present work, cedarwood (Cedrus deodara) essential oil embedded pectin nanocapsules were produced. The nanocapsules were characterized according to their morphology, size, encapsulation efficiency and thermal stability. Furthermore, the nanocapsules were impregnated onto mini cotton tea bags to be employed as RTU (ready to use) formulation for treating the breeding sites of mosquitoes. The larvicidal activity of the bags treated with pectin-cedar wood nanocapsules was assessed against malaria vector, Anopheles culicifacies and 98% mortality was recorded till 4 weeks, this suggests its potential and hassle free applications in controlling mosquito vector."

      "Akebia trifoliata subsp. australis is a well-known medicinal and potential woody oil plant in China. The limited genetic information available for A. trifoliata subsp. australis has hindered its exploitation. Here, a high-quality chromosome-level genome sequence of A. trifoliata subsp. australis is reported. The de novo genome assembly of 682.14 Mb was generated with a scaffold N50 of 43.11 Mb. The genome includes 25,598 protein-coding genes, and 71.18% (485.55 Mb) of the assembled sequences were identified as repetitive sequences. An ongoing massive burst of long terminal repeat (LTR) insertions, which occurred ~1.0 million years ago, has contributed a large proportion of LTRs in the genome of A. trifoliata subsp. australis. Phylogenetic analysis shows that A. trifoliata subsp. australis is closely related to Aquilegia coerulea and forms a clade with Papaver somniferum and Nelumbo nucifera, which supports the well-established hypothesis of a close relationship between basal eudicot species. The expansion of UDP-glucoronosyl and UDP-glucosyl transferase gene families and β-amyrin synthase-like genes and the exclusive contraction of terpene synthase gene families may be responsible for the abundant oleanane-type triterpenoids in A. trifoliata subsp. australis. Furthermore, the acyl-ACP desaturase gene family, including 12 stearoyl-acyl-carrier protein desaturase (SAD) genes, has expanded exclusively. A combined transcriptome and fatty-acid analysis of seeds at five developmental stages revealed that homologs of SADs, acyl-lipid desaturase omega fatty acid desaturases (FADs), and oleosins were highly expressed, consistent with the rapid increase in the content of fatty acids, especially unsaturated fatty acids. The genomic sequences of A. trifoliata subsp. australis will be a valuable resource for comparative genomic analyses and molecular breeding."

      "(1) Background: The COVID-19 pandemic and the imposition of strict but necessary measures to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus have been, and still are, major stress factors for adults, children, and adolescents. Stress harms human health as it creates free radicals in the human body. According to various recent studies, volatile oils from various aromatic plants have a high content of antioxidants and antimicrobial compounds. An external supply of antioxidants is required to destroy these free radicals. The main purpose of this paper is to create a yoghurt with high antioxidant capacity, using only raw materials from Romania; (2) Methods: The bioactive components used to enrich the cow milk yoghurt were extracted as volatile oils out of four aromatic plants: basil, mint, lavender and fennel. Initially, the compounds were extracted to determine the antioxidant capacity, and subsequently, the antioxidant activity of the yoghurt was determined. The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhy-drazyl (DPPH) method was used to determine the antioxidant activity; (3) Results: The results show that cow milk yoghurt enhanced with volatile oils of basil, lavender, mint and fennel, encapsulated in sodium alginate has an antioxidant and antimicrobial effect as a staple food with multiple effects in increasing the body's immunity. The antioxidant activity proved to be considerably higher than the control sample. The highest antioxidant activity was obtained on the first day of the analysis, decreasing onwards to measurements taken on days 10 and 20. The cow milk yoghurt enriched with volatile basil oil obtained the best results; (4) Conclusions: The paper shows that yoghurts with a high antioxidant capacity were obtained, using only raw materials from Romania. A healthy diet, compliance with safety conditions and finding appropriate and safe methods to increase the body's immunity is a good alternative to a major transition through harder times, such as pandemics. The creation of food products that include natural antioxidant compounds combines both the current great possibility of developing food production in Romania and the prevention and reduction of the effects caused by pandemic stress in the human body."

      "<h4>Objective</h4>Many pharmaceutical factories have dramatically improved the quality of herbal remedies in cancer treatment. The results of somestudies have shown anticancer effect of <i>Astrodaucus</i> genus<i>.</i> Therefore, the aim of this article was to review the chemical ingredients and biological effects of <i>Astrodaucus</i> genus especially <i>A. persicus</i> from the family Apiaceae (Umbelliferae).<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Online databases ScienceDirect, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched using the keywords <i>Astrodaucus</i>, Apiaceae, Biologic, Phytochemistry, and Benzodioxole to retrieve studies published between 1970 and 2020.<h4>Results</h4>The <i>Astrodaucus</i> genus has two species, <i>Astrodaucus persicus</i> (Boiss.) Drude and <i>Astrodaucus orientalis</i> (L.) Drude. In this genus, 5 new biologically active phytochemicals with benzodioxole structure were introduced and their biological effects were assessed.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Since many of the most commonly used anticancer drugs such as etoposide, teniposide, podophyllotoxin and sanguinarine have benzodioxole structureand according to the results of biological tests, it seems that more researchwith these perspectives should be done on this genus."

      "The research aim was to use orange essential oil and trehalose in a carrageenan matrix to form edible packaging. The edible packaging experimentally produced by casting from an aqueous solution were evaluated by the following analysis: UV-Vis spectrum, transparency value, transmittance, attenuated total reflectance Fourier-Transform spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and antimicrobial activity. The obtained results showed that the combination of orange essential oil with trehalose decreases the transmittance value in the UV and Vis regions (up to 0.14% ± 0.02% at 356 nm), meaning that produced films can act as a UV protector. Most produced films in the research were resistant to Gram-positive bacteria (<i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> subsp. <i>aureus</i>), though most films did not show antibacterial properties against Gram-negative bacteria and yeasts. FTIR and SEM confirmed that both the amount of carrageenan used and the combination with orange essential oil influenced the compatibility of trehalose with the film matrix. The research showed how different combinations of trehalose, orange essential oils and carrageenan can affect edible film properties. These changes represent important information for further research and the possible practical application of these edible matrices."

      "<i>Curcuma amada</i> Roxb. (Zingiberaceae), commonly known as mango ginger because its rhizome and foliar parts have a similar aroma to mango. The rhizome has been widely used in food industries and alternative medicines to treat a variety of internal diseases such as cough, bronchitis, indigestion, colic, loss of appetite, hiccups, and constipation. The composition of the volatile constituents in a fresh rhizome of <i>C. amada</i> is not reported in detail. The present study aimed to screen and characterize the composition of volatile organic compound (VOC) in a fresh rhizome of three <i>C. amada</i> (ZO45, ZO89, and ZO114) and one <i>C. longa</i> (ZO138) accessions originated from Myanmar. The analysis was carried out by means of headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) coupled with gas chromatography-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS). As a result, 122 VOCs were tentatively identified from the extracted 373 mass spectra. The following compounds were the ten most highly abundant and broadly present ones: <i>ar</i>-turmerone, α-zingiberene, α-santalene, (<i>E</i>)-γ-atlantone, cuparene, β-bisabolene, teresantalol, β-sesquiphellandrene, <i>trans</i>-α-bergamotene, γ-curcumene. The intensity of <i>ar-</i>turmerone, the sesquiterpene which is mainly characterized in <i>C. longa</i> essential oil (up to 15.5-27.5%), was significantly higher in <i>C. amada</i> accession ZO89 (15.707 ± 5.78<sup>a</sup>) compared to <i>C. longa</i> accession ZO138 (0.300 ± 0.08<sup>b</sup>). <i>Cis</i>-α-bergamotene was not detected in two <i>C. amada</i> accessions ZO45 and ZO89. The study revealed between-species variation regarding identified VOCs in the fresh rhizome of <i>C. amada</i> and <i>C. longa</i>."

      "<h4>Background</h4>The use of functional food, such as probiotic products, is important due to their health benefits against various diseases. Phenolic and aromatic compounds originating from medical plants can contribute to the growth of probiotic bacteria.<h4>Methods</h4>The ethanolic extract (0.2% and 0.4%) and essential oil (0.01% and 0.03%) of <i>Ferulago angulata</i> (FAEE and FAEO, respectively) were added to probiotic yogurt (<i>Lactobacillus acidophilus</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium bifidum</i> bacteria) to investigate their effects on the survival of probiotic bacteria during storage time (21 days) and assess its physicochemical, protein, and organoleptic properties.<h4>Results</h4>Upon increasing the concentration of FAEE and FAEO, the value of total phenol content, acidity, viscosity, and water absorption of yogurt treatments increased, and the pH, syneresis, and solubility of treatments showed a decreasing trend (<i>p</i> < .05). Also, adding 0.01% FAEO and 0.2% FAEE improved the organoleptic properties of yogurt (<i>p</i> < .05) compared to the control treatment. The survivability of the investigated probiotic bacteria demonstrated a decreased trend during storage in all treatments, but at the end of the study, the number of both probiotic bacteria in all treatments was significantly higher than that of the control samples.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Based on the results of protein, physicochemical, microbial, and sensory tests of herbal probiotic yogurts, the addition of 0.03% essential oil is the best way to realize the goals of the research."

      "<h4>Background</h4>The growing number of cases, severity and fatality of the COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with the fact that no cure has been found has made infected individuals especially in Africa, to resort to the consumption of different natural products to alleviate their condition. One of such plant materials that have been consumed to remedy the severity of this viral infection is the oil of <i>Nigella sativa</i> seed commonly called black seed oil. In this study, we extracted and characterized the oil from this seed using gas chromatography coupled to a mass selective detector to identify the component phytochemicals. Site-directed multiligand docking of the identified compounds was performed on SARS-CoV-2 molecular targets- Replicase polyprotein 1a, RNA binding protein of NSP9, ADP ribose phosphatase of NSP3, 3-chymotrypsin-like protease 3CLpro, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase RDRP, and ACE2-angiotensin-converting enzyme from the Homo sapiens.<h4>Results</h4>The binding affinity of caryophyllene oxide was the highest on 3CLpro (- 6.0 kcal/mol), NSP3 (- 6.3 kcal/mol), NSP9 (- 6.3 kcal/mol), and RDRP (- 6.9 kcal/mol) targets, while α-bergamotene gave the best binding affinity on RPIA (5.7 kcal/mol) target. The binding affinity of β-bisabolene on the ACE2 target (- 8.0 kcal/mol) was almost the same as Remdesivir (- 8.1 kcal/mol). The ADMET properties of these three phytochemicals showed that they are good drug leads for these SARS-CoV-2 receptors.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The findings from this study strongly indicate that the reported recovery from COVID-19 infection claimed by patients who consumed black seed oil could be linked to the presence of caryophyllene oxide, α-bergamotene, and β-bisabolene in this natural product."

      "Essential oils have emerged as viable alternatives to synthetic insecticides for control of mosquito-borne pathogens. The leaf essential oils of eight species of <i>Premna</i> (Lamiaceae) growing in central Vietnam have been obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Sesquiterpene hydrocarbons dominated most of the <i>Premna</i> essential oils, with the notable exception of <i>Premna</i><i>mekongensis</i> from Ngoc Linh Nature Reserve, which had α-pinene as the major component. Larvicidal activities against <i>Aedes aegypti</i> have been determined and all of the <i>Premna</i> essential oils showed larvicidal activity with 24-h LC<sub>50</sub> < 65 μg/mL. The leaf essential oils of <i>Premna</i><i>cambodiana</i> from Chu Mom Ray National Park and <i>Premna</i><i>mekongensis</i> from Ngoc Linh Nature Reserve showed the best larvicidal activities with 24-h LC<sub>50</sub> of 16.8 and 18.0 μg/mL, respectively. The essential oil compositions and larvicidal activities of <i>P. cambodiana</i>, <i>Premna flavescens</i>, <i>Premna</i><i>maclurei</i>, <i>P. mekongensis</i>, and <i>Premna</i><i>puberula</i> are reported for the first time. Although the larvicidal activities of <i>Premna</i> leaf essential oils are promising, the essential oil yields are relatively low (0.10-0.25%)."

      "The Orange Spiny Whitefly (OSW) Aleurocanthus spiniferus (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) represents a new serious threat to Citrus spp., grapevine and ornamental plants in the whole Mediterranean area. Such threat urgently calls for the development of a sustainable control strategy, including insecticides compatible with biological control, and applicable also in organic citrus farming that represent an essential part of Mediterranean agricultural economy. Therefore, we evaluated the toxicity and the effects on host searching, oviposition, and probing and feeding behavior exerted on OSW by organic insecticides supposed to have limited side effects on environment and ecosystem services, i.e. sweet orange essential oil (EO), extract of Clitoria ternatea (CT), mineral oil, pyrethrin and azadirachtin. Despite none of the compounds caused a significant mortality of any of the OSW instars, we observed interesting effects on whitefly behavior: (i) EO and pyrethrin showed a relevant repellent effect, with impairment of both adults landing and oviposition on treated plants; (ii) CT and pyrethrin strongly affected probing behavior. Here, in the light of our findings, we discuss possible OSW sustainable control strategies and further research perspectives."

      "Plant proteins are being considered to become the most important protein source of the future, and to do so, they must be able to replace the animal-derived proteins currently in use as techno-functional food ingredients. This poses challenges because plant proteins are oftentimes storage proteins with a high molecular weight and low water solubility. One promising approach to overcome these limitations is the glycation of plant proteins. The covalent bonding between the proteins and different carbohydrates created via the initial stage of the Maillard reaction can improve the techno-functional characteristics of these proteins without the involvement of potentially toxic chemicals. However, compared to studies with animal-derived proteins, glycation studies on plant proteins are currently still underrepresented in literature. This review provides an overview of the existing studies on the glycation of the major groups of plant proteins with different carbohydrates using different preparation methods. Emphasis is put on the reaction conditions used for glycation as well as the modifications to physicochemical properties and techno-functionality. Different applications of these glycated plant proteins in emulsions, foams, films, and encapsulation systems are introduced. Another focus lies on the reaction chemistry of the Maillard reaction and ways to harness it for controlled glycation and to limit the formation of undesired advanced glycation products. Finally, challenges related to the controlled glycation of plant proteins to improve their properties are discussed."

      "In this study, the chemical composition of the vapor and liquid phase of <i>Pinus cembra</i> L., <i>Pinus mugo</i> Turra, <i>Picea abies</i> L., and <i>Abies Alba</i> M. needles essential oils (EOs) was investigated by Headspace-Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (HS-GC/MS). In the examined EOs, a total of twenty-eight components were identified, most of which belong to the monoterpenes family. α-Pinene (16.6-44.0%), β-pinene (7.5-44.7%), limonene (9.5-32.5%), and γ-terpinene (0.3-19.7%) were the most abundant components of the liquid phase. Such major compounds were also detected in the vapor phase of all EOs, and α-pinene reached higher relative percentages than in the liquid phase. Then, both the liquid and vapor phases were evaluated in terms of antibacterial activity against three Gram-negative bacteria (<i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Pseudomonas fluorescens</i>, and <i>Acinetobacter bohemicus</i>) and two Gram-positive bacteria (<i>Kocuria marina</i> and <i>Bacillus cereus</i>) using a microwell dilution assay, disc diffusion assay, and vapor phase test. The lowest Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) (13.28 mg/mL) and Minimal Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) (26.56 mg/mL) values, which correspond to the highest antibacterial activities, were reported for <i>P. abies</i> EO against <i>A. bohemicus</i> and for <i>A. alba</i> EO against <i>A. bohemicus</i> and <i>B. cereus</i>. The vapor phase of all the tested EOs was more active than liquid phase, showing the inhibition halos from 41.00 ± 10.15 mm to 80.00 ± 0.00 mm for three bacterial strains (<i>A. bohemicus</i>, <i>K. marina</i>, and <i>B. cereus</i>). Furthermore, antioxidant activities were also investigated by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azinobis (3- ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) assays, and a concentration-dependent antioxidant capacity for all EOs was found. <i>P. mugo</i> EO showed the best antioxidant activity than the other Pinaceae EOs. The four Pinaceae EOs could be further investigated for their promising antibacterial and antioxidant properties, and, in particular, α-pinene seems to have interesting possibilities for use as a novel natural antibacterial agent."

      "<h4>Background</h4>The chemical composition of Handal (<i>Citrullus colocynthis</i> L.) seed oil cultivated in Jordan deserts was characterized, and its bioactivity was evaluated.<h4>Methods</h4>The oil was extracted from the grinded seeds in 500 ml Soxhlet extractor for 24 hr using n-hexane, and the recovered fatty acids were methylated with methanolic-HCL. The fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) composition was analyzed using GC-MS and GC-FID. The anticancer activity associated with the oil was assessed against colon cancer cell lines (Caco-2 and HCT-116) and compared to its cytotoxicity on the human skin fibroblast. Multivariate analysis was used to determine relationship of the fatty acid composition with that of the anticancer activity.<h4>Results</h4>The results demonstrated that fatty acid composition of <i>Citrullus colocynthis</i> seed oil chiefly contains Linoleic acid, denoted as C18:2n6 (75%), followed by Palmitic acid C16:0 (8%), Stearic acid C18:0 (5%), and Oleic acid C18:1n9 (9%). It is demonstrated as an excellent source of essential fatty acids omega-6 (e.g., Linoleic acid), whereas omega-3 (e.g., α-Linolenic acid) and hydroxy polyunsaturated fatty acids are found at small level. Interestingly, the oil exhibited reasonable anticancer effects against colorectal cancer cell lines with IC<sub>50</sub> values varying between 4 and 7 mg/ml. The correlation test revealed a relationship between the fatty acid composition and the effectiveness on treatments.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Handal plant from Jordan appears to have very high level of Linoleic acid compared to other oils measured in different geographic locations and that there appears to be some anticancer activities associated with the fatty acid content of Handal seed oil."

      "Crude oil contamination is a serious environmental threat for soil and plants growing in it. This study provides the first experimental evidence for comparison of the efficacy of pyrochar (slow pyrolysis biochar), thermal desorption and their combined application for degradation of crude oil contaminated soil (0%, 10%, and 20%), and growth of lettuce under glasshouse conditions. Pyrochar was produced by pyrolysis of sawdust at 350 °C, whereas thermal desorption was done by soil pyrolysis at 500 °C. Soil incubations were done for 120 days. The results of soil analysis showed that the crude oil degradation efficiency for the combined application was highest (40%), whereas pyrochar and thermal desorption was 25% and 19.6%, respectively. The maximum degradation products of crude oil were manifested by the detection of low molecular weight hydrocarbons (ranged between 173 and 422) in the soil with combined application treatment using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Crude oil contamination significantly reduced the germination and growth of the lettuce plants. Similarly, the combined application also improved plant growth by an increase of 24% in germination percentage, 35.5% in seedling vigor index, and 27% in promptness index under 20% crude oil contamination. Remediation caused a significant increase in fresh and dry biomass (40%), leaf area (30%), total chlorophyll (21%), water potential (23.6%), osmotic potential (27%), and membrane stability index (40%). Moreover, there was an increase in the contents of proline (32%), total amino acids (29%), soluble sugars (37%), proteins (27%), and antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (19%), catalase (33%) and peroxidase (38%). This study confirmed the efficacy of pyrochar (slow pyrolysis biochar), thermal desorption, and their combined application for crude oil decontamination of soil at laboratory scale and also in improving soil usability by improved germination and growth of lettuce."

      "Traditional plant-based remedies hold vast potential as novel antimicrobial agents, particularly for recalcitrant infection states such as biofilms. To explore their potential, it is important to bring these remedies out of historical treatises, and into present-day scientific evaluation. Using an example of Indian traditional medicine (Ayurveda), we present a perspective toward evaluating historical remedies for anti-biofilm potential. Across compendia, we identified three plant-based remedies (of <i>Kalanchoe pinnata</i>, <i>Cynodon dactylon</i>, and <i>Ocimum tenuiflorum</i>) recommended for wounds. The remedies were reconstituted in accordance with historical practices, and tested for their effects on biofilm formation and eradication assays of wound pathogens, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. Based on our approach and the results obtained, we provide insights into the considerations and challenges related to identifying potential remedies in historical texts, and testing them in the laboratory with standard biofilm assays. We believe this will be relevant for future studies exploring anti-biofilm approaches at the interface of historical medicine and present-day scientific practices."

      "Rotary drilling for oil and natural gas uses drilling fluid for lubrication of the bit, to seal off unstable shale layers, and floating out rock cuttings. Drilling fluid is a water–clay chemical mixture. Produced water is a water–sand chemical mixture. Land farming is a common disposal technique of drilling fluid and produced water. In the land farming process, amendments of fluid are repeatedly applied to the soil surface. Plant growth and soil chemical properties may be altered by additions of drilling fluid, because of alkalinity, salinity, trace elements, and petroleum residue contained in waste. The objective of this study was to determine the change in soil pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total nitrogen and carbon, and extractable nutrient levels following the land application of drilling fluid and produced water. The study was a comparison of three plots with similar soil properties and conditions. The three study plots had various levels of drilling fluid and produced water applications. The data show a major difference from field-to-field for EC, Na, and Cl levels. The EC and salt levels increased with additional applications of drilling fluid and produced water. The percent total nitrogen values and plant available P levels were very low in all fields. High EC and salt values, coupled with low N and P levels, would be detrimental to plant growth and development. To successfully vegetate this land-farm site, application of N and P fertilizer would be required. This study help to give a better understanding of practical ways to land-farm drilling fluid and produced water in a fashion that both minimizes environmental issues and is economically feasible in Arkansas. Thus, this research will provide important information for soil contamination management and contributes on understanding of the responses of soil properties to drilling fluid and produced water in the future."

      "We conducted a series of experiments to test insect embryo capability to survive and increase reproductive investment during early development after short exposure to essential oils. We used Callosobruchus maculatus as a model insect and eucalyptus leaf and flower essential oils. Both essential oils exhibited toxicity against C. maculatus embryos and adults. However, flower essential oil was more toxic. A fetus exposed to essential oils tried to make the best of a bad situation and compensate essential oils harmful effects in the later life stages. Insect progeny production guarantee resulted in a trade-off between reproduction and female longevity. The insect also could alter fitness and reproductive behavior including, mating latency reduction, copulation duration increase, and copulation success rate raise in adulthood. Flower essential oil-exposed embryos were more successful in increasing copulation duration, and leaf essential oil-exposed embryos achieved more copulation success and less mating latency. These consequences persisted until F1 generation that was not directly exposed to essential oil. However, the F2 generation could concur with the harmful effects of essential oils. C. maculatus embryo might use epigenetic mechanisms to guarantee progeny production. Reproductive behavior changes and the trade-off can be evolutionary mechanisms to save species from possible extinction in deleterious situations."

      "<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to determine the chemical profile of <i>Lantana camara</i> leaf oil.<h4>Methods</h4>The essential oil was extracted from dried leaf samples using the Soxhlet extraction method. The oil was separated from the solvent and the bioactive compounds were identified using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The identified peaks in the mass spectrum were matched with the database of the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) library.<h4>Results</h4>The FT-IR results indicated the presence of alcohols, carboxylic acids, phenols, alkanes, ketones, and primary amine compounds. GC-MS identified 43 compounds representing 95% of the total leaf essential oil components. Some of the major isolated compounds included a pyrrolizine; 1-dodecanol; 1,2-nonadecanediol; phytol; 1,3-dioxolane; 4-undecene, 9-methyl, (Z)-; 1-eicosanol; and imidazole.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The identified constituents of the extracted oil have established pharmacologic and insecticidal activities, and these compounds are also used in the drink, food, and cosmetic industries. This extract is highly valuable for the medical treatment of various ailments."

      "<h4>Background</h4>With declining wild fish populations, farmed salmon has gained popularity as a source for healthy long-chain highly unsaturated fatty acids (LC-HUFA). However, the introduction of plant oil in farmed salmon feeds has reduced the content of these beneficial LC-HUFA. The synthetic capability for LC-HUFAs depends upon the dietary precursor fatty acids and the genetic potential, thus there is a need for in-depth understanding of LC-HUFA synthetic genes and their interactions with other genes involved in lipid metabolism. Several key genes of LC-HUFA synthesis in salmon belong to the fatty acid desaturases 2 (fads2) family. The present study applied whole transcriptome analysis on two CRISPR-mutated salmon strains (crispants), 1) Δ6abc/5<sup>Mt</sup> with mutations in Δ5fads2, Δ6fads2-a, Δ6fads2-b and Δ6fads2-c genes, and 2) Δ6bc<sup>Mt</sup> with mutations in Δ6fads2-b and Δ6fads2-c genes. Our purpose is to evaluate the genetic effect fads2 mutations have on other lipid metabolism pathways in fish, as well as to investigate mosaicism in a commercial species with a very long embryonal period.<h4>Results</h4>Both Δ6abc/5<sup>Mt</sup> and Δ6bc<sup>Mt</sup> crispants demonstrated high percentage of indels within all intended target genes, though different indel types and percentage were observed between individuals. The Δ6abc/5<sup>Mt</sup> fish displayed several disruptive indels which resulted in over 100 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) enriched in lipid metabolism pathways in liver. This includes up-regulation of srebp1 genes which are known key transcription regulators of lipid metabolism as well as a number of down-stream genes involved in fatty acid de-novo synthesis, fatty acid β-oxidation and lipogenesis. Both elovl5 and elovl2 genes were not changed, suggesting that the genes were not targeted by Srebp1. The mutation of Δ6bc<sup>Mt</sup> surprisingly resulted in over 3000 DEGs which were enriched in factors encoding genes involved in mRNA regulation and stability.<h4>Conclusions</h4>CRISPR-Cas9 can efficiently mutate multiple fads2 genes simultaneously in salmon. The results of the present study have provided new information on the transcriptional regulations of lipid metabolism genes after reduction of LC-HUFA synthesis pathways in salmon."

      "Miracle fruit plant or Miracle berry plant (<i>Synsepalum dulcificum</i>) is a peculiar medicinal plant because of the unique taste-modifying property of its fruit which is due to the presence of the glycoprotein, miraculin. This property has been known for centuries to the people of tropical Western and Central Africa who also employ different parts of the plant in the management of various ailments. Scientific investigations have unravelled several pharmacological properties of the plant which include antidiabetic, blood cholesterol-lowering, anti-hyperuricaemia, antioxidant, anticonvulsant and anticancer properties. Also, subacute administration of the plant extract up to 200 mg/kg was not found to be toxic in rats. Apart from miraculin, other pharmacologically active compounds have been identified in the plant including alkaloids (dihydro-feruloyl-5-methoxytyramine, N-cis-caffeoyltyramine, N-cis-feruloyl-tyramine), lignins (+-syringaresinol, +-epi-syringaresinol), phytosterols, triterpenoids, phenolic acids, flavonoids, and amino acids. The plant has also been credited with notable nutritional benefits. Proper documentation of available information on folkloric use, biological activity, constituent phytocompounds, and nutritional benefits of ethnobotanicals will go a long way in affording optimal benefits from their therapeutic potentials. This can also aid in the conservation of species at risk of extinction. This work presents an up-to-date review of the ethnobotany, phytochemistry, biological and nutritional properties of <i>Synsepalum dulcificum</i>."

      "This study aimed to characterize the in vitro antioxidant and antibacterial properties of oregano (<i>Origanum vulgare</i>) essential oil, as well as its chemical composition. To our best knowledge, there are few studies on oregano grown in the arid Andes region, but none on the metabolites produced and their bioactivity. This work identified fifty metabolites by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS)-monoterpene hydrocarbons, oxygenated monoterpenes, phenolic monoterpenes, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, and oxygenated sesquiterpenes-present in the essential oil of oregano collected in the Atacama Desert. The main components of essential oregano oil were thymol (15.9%), <i>Z</i>-sabinene hydrate (13.4%), γ-terpinene (10.6%), <i>p</i>-cymene (8.6%), linalyl acetate (7.2%), sabinene (6.5%), and carvacrol methyl ether (5.6%). The antibacterial tests showed that the pathogenic bacteria <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> and <i>Salmonella enterica</i> and the phytopathogenic bacteria <i>Erwinia rhapontici</i> and <i>Xanthomonas campestris</i> were the most susceptible to oregano oil, with the lowest concentrations of oil necessary to inhibit their bacterial growth. Moreover, oregano oil showed antibacterial activity against bacteria associated with food poisoning. In conclusion, <i>O. vulgare</i> from the arid Andean region possesses an important antibacterial activity with a high potential in the food industry and agriculture."

      "Protium heptaphyllum (Aubl.) Marchand (PH) trees are endemic to the tropical region of South America, mostly Brazil. Antibacterial, antinociceptive, anti-inflammatory, anxiolytic, antidepressant and anti-hyperlipidemic/anti-hypercholesterolemic effects were reported for its resinous exudate Protiumheptaphyllum resin (PHR). This work aims to provide a qualitative and quantitative consistent chemical profiling of the major constituents of this resin and two extracts enriched in acid (acidic triterpene concentrated extract, ATCE) and neutral triterpenes (α and β-amyrin concentrated extract, AMCE). GC–MS/GC–FID was used for volatile terpene fraction, a validated GC–MS method was developed for quantification of neutral α and β-amyrin and HPLC–APCI HRMS2 was used for acidic triterpenes analysis. The chemical investigation reported 29 molecules, including 14 volatile terpenes, 6 neutral triterpenes and 11 acid triterpenes. The most abundant compounds were α-amyrin (251.28 g kg−1, 123.98 g kg−1 and 556.82 g kg−1 in PHR, ATCE and AMCE, respectively), β-amyrin (172.66 g kg−1, 95.39 g kg−1 and 385.58 g kg−1 in PHR, ATCE and AMCE, respectively), 3-oxo-tirucalla-7,24-dien-21-oic acid (80.64 g kg−1, 157.10 g kg−1 and 15.31 g kg−1 in PHR, ATCE and AMCE, respectively) and 3α-hydroxy-tirucalla-8,24-dien-21-oic acid (77.71 g kg−1, 130.40 g kg−1 and 11.64 g kg−1 in PHR, ATCE and AMCE, respectively). Results showed specific enrichment of acidic and neutral triterpenoids in the two respective extracts."

      "<i>Campylobacter</i> species have developed resistance to existing antibiotics. The development of alternative therapies is, therefore, a necessity. This study evaluates the susceptibility of <i>Campylobacter</i> strains to selected natural products (NPs) and frontline antibiotics. Two <i>C. jejuni</i> strains (ATCC<sup>®</sup> 33560<sup>TM</sup> and MT947450) and two <i>C. coli</i> strains (ATCC<sup>®</sup> 33559<sup>TM</sup> and MT947451) were used. The antimicrobial potential of the NPs, including plant extracts, essential oils, and pure phytochemicals, was evaluated by broth microdilution. The growth was measured by spectrophotometry and iodonitrotetrazolium chloride. Antibiotic resistance genes (<i>tet</i>(O) and <i>gyr</i>A) were characterized at the molecular level. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) ranged from 25 to 1600 µg/mL. Cinnamon oil, (E)-Cinnamaldehyde, clove oil, eugenol, and baicalein had the lowest MIC and MBC values (25-100 µg/mL). MT947450 and MT947451 were sensitive to erythromycin and gentamicin but resistant to quinolones and tetracycline. Mutations in <i>gyr</i>A and <i>tet</i>(O) genes from resistant strains were confirmed by sequencing. The findings show that NPs are effective against drug-sensitive and drug-resistant <i>Campylobacter</i> strains. The resistance to antibiotics was confirmed at phenotypic and genotypic levels. This merits further studies to decipher the action mechanisms and synergistic activities of NPs."

      "The box tree moth (<i>Cydalima perspectalis</i> Walker) is an invasive species in Europe causing severe damage both in natural and ornamental boxwood (<i>Buxus</i> spp.) vegetation. Pest management tactics are often based on the use of chemical insecticides, whereas environmentally-friendly control solutions are not available against this insect. The application of essential oils may provide effective protection against oviposition and subsequent larval damage. Oviposition deterrence of cinnamon, eucalyptus and lavender essential oils was tested on female <i>C. perspectalis</i> in behavioural bioassays. Our results indicate that all the studied essential oils may be adequate deterrents; however, cinnamon oil exhibited the strongest effect. To determine the physiologically active compounds in the headspace of the essential oils, gas chromatography coupled with electroantennography recordings were performed in parallel with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify the volatile constituents. In addition, the release rates of various components from vial-wick dispensers were measured during the oviposition bioassay. These results may serve as a basis for the development of a practical and insecticide-free plant protection method against this invasive moth species."

      "The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an emerging situation with high rates of morbidity and mortality, in the pathophysiology of which inflammation and thrombosis are implicated. The disease is directly connected to the nutritional status of patients and a well-balanced diet is recommended by official sources. Recently, the role of platelet activating factor (PAF) was suggested in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. In the present review several micronutrients (vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, vitamin D, selenium, omega-3 fatty acids, and minerals), phytochemicals and Mediterranean diet compounds with potential anti-COVID activity are presented. We further underline that the well-known anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic actions of the investigated nutrients and/or holistic dietary schemes, such as the Mediterranean diet, are also mediated through PAF. In conclusion, there is no single food to prevent coronavirus Although the relationship between PAF and COVID-19 is not robust, a healthy diet containing PAF inhibitors may target both inflammation and thrombosis and prevent the deleterious effects of COVID-19. The next step is the experimental confirmation or not of the PAF-COVID-19 hypothesis."

      "Colombia is experiencing significant growth in its agricultural areas, its diverse production chains make the country an excellent candidate in the development of biorefineries, and as a result, there is an increasing need to take full advantage of biomass and obtain high value-added by-products from waste. In this sense, biorefineries are presented as a great alternative for the use of biomass; however, the methodologies of biorefinery synthesis lack a parameter that limits the growth of production lines under incremental exergetic and economic returns. This research develops a biorefinery synthesis methodology using an African palm biorefinery as a case study; a novel approach is developed to facilitate a stop criterion for biorefinery expansion through a combined consideration of economic incremental returns (IROI) and exegetical returns of investment (ExROI), avoiding unnecessary plant expansions or new processes that are not profitable or adequate in terms of useful energy. The development of this methodology required simulations in Aspen Plus software and technical-economic and exergetic evaluation with an incremental approach of four scenarios in Excel. The base case is palm oil production from African palm clusters. The second case includes the production of palm kernel oil and palm cake from residues. The third case implements the production of hydrogen based on other residues from the base case. The last case study incorporates the preceding case and the addition of biodiesel and glycerin production from palm oil. Case 3 exhibits a higher economic performance with an IROI of 42.98%; in terms of exergy, case 2 exhibits considerable improvements over the base case, with an ExROI of 158%. A parameter called the exergo-economic weighted incremental return on investment (IExWROI) was obtained, evidencing a 75% improvement in case 2 compared to the base case. The new indicator aims to provide a more comprehensive approach to biorefinery design by optimization of economic and exergetic returns, contributing a new alternative for decision-making in regard to plant design, plant expansion projects, and implementation of subprocesses."

      "Mosquito-borne diseases are a large problem in Vietnam as elsewhere. Due to environmental concerns regarding the use of synthetic insecticides as well as developing insecticidal resistance, there is a need for environmentally-benign alternative mosquito control agents. In addition, resistance of pathogenic microorganisms to antibiotics is an increasing problem. As part of a program to identify essential oils as alternative larvicidal and antimicrobial agents, the leaf, stem, and rhizome essential oils of several <i>Zingiber</i> species, obtained from wild-growing specimens in northern Vietnam, were acquired by hydrodistillation and investigated using gas chromatography. The mosquito larvicidal activities of the essential oils were assessed against <i>Culex quinquefasciatus</i>, <i>Aedes albopictus</i>, and <i>Ae. aegypti</i>, and for antibacterial activity against a selection of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and for activity against <i>Candida albicans</i>. <i>Zingiber</i> essential oils rich in α-pinene and β-pinene showed the best larvicidal activity. <i>Zingiber nudicarpum</i> rhizome essential oil showed excellent antibacterial activity against <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i>, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, and <i>Bacillus cereus</i>, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 2, 8, and 1 μg/mL, respectively. However, the major components, α-pinene and β-pinene, cannot explain the antibacterial activities obtained."

      "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global pandemic and is posing a serious challenge to mankind. As per the current scenario, there is an urgent need for antiviral that could act as a protective and therapeutic against SARS-CoV-2. Previous studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is much similar to the SARS-CoV bat that occurred in 2002-03. Since it is a zoonotic virus, the exact source is still unknown, but it is believed bats may be the primary reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 through which it has been transferred to humans. In this review, we have tried to summarize some of the approaches that could be effective against SARS-CoV-2. Firstly, plants or plant-based products have been effective against different viral diseases, and secondly, plants or plant-based natural products have the minimum adverse effect. We have also highlighted a few vitamins and minerals that could be beneficial against SARS-CoV-2."

      "Chewable gel tablets are an underdeveloped subject, even though there are many simple chewable tablets and gummy candies in the food and pharmaceutical industries. Chewable gel tablets are not as sweet, they can have an active substance, pharmacological effect, and a value of nutrition. The aim of this study was to prepare gelatin-based chewable tablets with <i>Myristica fragrans</i> as a preservative and to determine the shelf-life variability depending on storage conditions, and to evaluate texture changes. Firmness and springiness of gel tablets were measured by a texture analyzer and compared between different storage conditions and the shelf-life of tablets was established by mold growing time. Chewable gel tablets were prepared by using silicone form. Mold was most likely to grow on tablets that have been packaged in squeezable bags (after 14 days 60% of all formulations had a mold, <i>p</i> < 0.05). The most stable tablets (over 180 days) were in sealed boxes and contained nutmeg essential oil or its solution, or ethanolic nutmeg extract. The gel tablets' firmness increased about 4 times when they were stored in opened plastic boxes and their springiness decreased about 1.65 times after 28 days in the mentioned conditions, <i>p</i> < 0.05. Nutmeg hydrolat had the highest influence on texture variation (<i>p</i> < 0.05)."

      "Human skin is continually changing. The condition of the skin largely depends on the individual's overall state of health. A balanced diet plays an important role in the proper functioning of the human body, including the skin. The present study draws attention to bioactive substances, i.e., vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, polyphenols, and carotenoids, with a particular focus on their effects on the condition of the skin. The aim of the study was to review the literature on the effects of bioactive substances on skin parameters such as elasticity, firmness, wrinkles, senile dryness, hydration and color, and to define their role in the process of skin ageing."

      "Health food has become a prominent force in the market place, influencing many food industries to focus on numerous bioactive compounds to reap benefits from its properties. Use of these compounds in food matrices has several limitations. Most of the food bio-additives are sensitive compounds that may quickly decompose in both food and within the gastrointestinal tract. Since most of these bioactives are highly or partially lipophilic molecules, they possess very low water solubility and insufficient dispersibility, leading to poor bioavailability. Thus, various methods of microencapsulation of large number of food bioactives have been studied. For encapsulation of hydrophobic compounds several lipid carriers and lipid platforms have been studied, including emulsions, microemulsions, micelles, liposomes, and lipid nano- and microparticles. Solid lipid particles (SLP) are a promising delivery system, can both deliver bioactive compounds, reduce their degradation, and permit slow and sustained release. Solid lipid particles have important advantages compared to other polymer carriers in light of their simple production technology, including scale up ability, higher loading capacity, extremely high biocompatibility, and usually low cost. This delivery system provides improved stability, solubility in various matrixes, bioavailability, and targeting properties. This article reviews recent studies on microencapsulation of selected bioactive food ingredients in solid lipid-based carriers from a point of view of production methods, characteristics of obtained particles, loading capability, stability, and release profile."

      "The volatile components of essential oil (EO), SPME, and SPME of solvent extracts ( <i>n</i> -hexane, methanol, and water) obtained from fresh <i>Serapias orientalis</i> subsp. <i>orientalis</i> ( <i>Soo</i> ) were analyzed by GC-FID/MS. EO of <i>Soo</i> gave 11 compounds in the percentage of 99.97%; capronaldehyde (37.01%), 2-( <i>E</i> )-hexenal (23.19%), and <i>n</i> -nonanal (19.05%) were found to be major constituents. SPME GC-FID/MS analyses of fresh plant and solvent extracts of <i>Soo</i> revealed 7, 12, 7, and 4 compounds within the range of 99.7% to 99.9%. Limonene (76.5%, 41.7%, and 61.3%) was the major compound in SPMEs of the <i>n</i> -hexane and methanol extracts. <i>α</i> -Methoxy- <i>p</i> -cresol (52.9%) was the main component in its water extract. The antimicrobial activity of EO and the solvent extracts of <i>Soo</i> were screened against 9microorganisms. EO showed the best activity against <i>Mycobacterium smegmatis</i> , with 79.5 µg/mL MIC value. The <i>n</i> -hexane, methanol, and water extracts were the most active against the <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> within the range of 81.25-125.0 µg/mL (MIC). IC <sub>50</sub> values for the lipase enzyme inhibitory activity of EO and solvent extracts ( <i>n</i> -hexane, methanol, and water) were determined to be 59.87 µg/mL, 64.03 µg/mL, 101.91 µg/mL, and 121.24 µg/mL, respectively."

      "The highly valuable heartwood of <i>Dalbergia odorifera</i> T. Chen, known as <i>Jiang Xiang</i> in traditional Chinese medicine, is formed very slowly, and there is a need to better understand the process and promote heartwood formation. Chemical induction is considered to be one of the promising methods to induce heartwood formation. However, to date no method has been proved effective for <i>D. odorifera</i> as little is known about biochemical and physiological changes during heartwood development. Three potential heartwood induction substances <i>viz.</i> acetic acid, sodium chloride, and hydrogen peroxide solutions were injected into the trunk of <i>D. odorifera</i> to determine the effect on heartwood formation and physiological activity. Non-structural carbohydrates, lipids, wood properties, and essential oil were assessed in the post-treatment period. As also observed in the formation of natural heartwood, chemical-induced <i>Jiang Xiang</i> production was accompanied by sapwood dehydration, non-structural carbohydrates consumption, and synthesis of heartwood substances. As the heartwood substances accumulated, basic density and essential oil content increased gradually, thereby <i>Jiang Xiang</i> was finally produced. In this process, physiological parameters of discolored sapwood gradually evolved to resemble those of natural heartwood. Hydrogen peroxide-induced <i>Jiang Xiang</i> was closest to natural heartwood, and the essential oil components met the standards for high-quality <i>Jiang Xiang</i>, while the induction effects of acetic acid and sodium chloride were unsatisfactory. Thus, this study indicates that hydrogen peroxide has the potential to induce <i>Jiang Xiang</i> production in <i>Dalbergia odorifera</i>."

      "<i>Piper cubeba</i> L. fruit is an important species used in folk medicine for different types of pains such as rheumatism, chills, flu, colds, muscular aches, and fever. This study examines the chemical constituents, antioxidant activity, and potential inhibitory effect against human peroxiredoxin 5, a key enzyme of <i>P. cubeba</i> essential oil from fruits. Using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS), the principal components were methyleugenol (41.31%) and eugenol (33.95%), followed by (E)-caryophyllene (5.65%), <i>p</i>-cymene-8-ol (3.50%), 1,8-cineole (2.94%), and α-terpinolene (1.41%). Results showed similar scavenging activity via 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl DPPH radical scavenging activity (IC<sub>50</sub> = 110.00 ± 0.08 μg/mL), as well as very potent antioxidant activity against both ferric reducing/antioxidant power (FRAP) (106.00 ± 0.11 μg/mL) and β-carotene bleaching (IC<sub>50</sub> = 315.00 ± 2.08 μg/mL) assays when compared to positive butylated hydroxytoluene and ascorbic acid. The molecular docking approach has also been performed to screen the antioxidant activities of the major and potent compounds against human protein target peroxiredoxin 5. Results showed good binding profiles and attributed the strongest inhibitory activity to β-caryophyllene oxide (-5.8 kcal/mol), followed respectively by isocembrol and α-selinene (-5.4 kcal/mol), and viridiflorol (-5.1 kcal/mol). Furthermore, ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion)-related physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties have been assessed and support our in vitro findings. This work demonstrates the powerful antioxidant potency of cubeba pepper and paves the way for the discovery and development of antioxidant agent with high potency."

      "Acne vulgaris is one of the most common chronic inflammatory skin diseases. Bergamot and sweet orange are rich in nutritional and functional components, which exhibit antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic effect. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential effect of bergamot and sweet orange (juice and essential oil) on acne vulgaris caused by excessive secretion of androgen. Eighty male golden hamsters were randomly divided into 10 groups and received low or high dose of bergamot and sweet orange juice and essential oil, physiological saline, and positive drugs for four weeks, respectively. Results showed that all interventions could improve acne vulgaris by reducing the growth rate of sebaceous gland spots, inhibiting TG accumulation, decreasing the release of inflammatory cytokines (notably reducing IL-1<i>α</i> levels), promoting apoptosis in the sebaceous gland, and decreasing the ratio of T/E<sub>2</sub>. Among them, bergamot and orange essential oil may have better effects (dose dependent) on alleviating acne vulgaris than the corresponding juice. In view of the large population of acne patients and the widespread use of sweet orange and bergamot, this study is likely to exert an extensive and far-reaching influence."

      "Essential oils (EOs) have gained a renewed interest in many disciplines such as plant disease control and medicine. This review discusses the components of ginger EOs, their mode of action, and their potential nanotechnology applications in controlling tropical plant diseases. Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS), high-performance liquid chromatography, and headspace procedures are commonly used to detect and profile their chemical compositions EOs in ginger. The ginger EOs are composed of monoterpenes (transcaryophyllene, camphene, geranial, eucalyptol, and neral) and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (<i>α</i>-zingiberene, ar-curcumene, <i>β</i>-bisabolene, and <i>β</i>-sesquiphellandrene). GC-MS analysis of the EOs revealed many compounds but few compounds were revealed using the headspace approach. The EOs have a wide range of activities against many phytopathogens. EOs mode of action affects both the pathogen cell's external envelope and internal structures. The problems associated with solubility and stability of EOs had prompted the use nanotechnology such as nanoemulsions. The use of nanoemulsion to increase efficiency and supply of EOs to control plant diseases control was discussed in this present paper. The findings of this review paper may accelerate the effective use of ginger EOs in controlling tropical plant diseases."

      "<h4>Background</h4>Due to concerns regarding the safety of the chemical control measures, the trend is shifting globally towards the use of natural compounds as antimicrobial agent especially, plant essential oils.<h4>Results</h4>This study presented the antibacterial potential of Cymbopogon khasianus essential oil (CKEO) against human pathogens: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans with MIC ranging from 20 to 100 μg/mL. CKEO, in comparison to its major constituent, geraniol, showed better MICs against tested pathogens. In combination studies, the effective concentrations of CKEO and streptomycin were reduced from 20 to 5 μg/mL and 11 to 0.7 ng/mL against E. coli. This suggests their synergistic action. However, CKEO showed partial synergy with ciprofloxacin. To understand the efficacy of CKEO, time-kill kinetics was performed. CKEO took the half time to show the bactericidal effect in comparison to streptomycin at their 2x MICs (double the MIC), while their combination took only 30 min for this. Fluorescence and surface electron microscopic and protein estimation studies suggested the multi-target action of CKEO-streptomycin combination against E. coli. Further, CKEO alone/in combination exhibited less than 10% haemolytic activity at its MIC.<h4>Conclusion</h4>These results indicate that CKEO is a potentially safe alternative for the treatment of various pathogenic bacterial strains. It could be used for a variety of applications including human health, food storage, aquaculture, etc."

      "Major lignans of sesame sesamin and sesamolin are benzodioxol--substituted furofurans. Sesamol, sesaminol, its epimers, and episesamin are transformation products found in processed products. Synthetic routes to all lignans are known but only sesamol is synthesized industrially. Biosynthesis of furofuran lignans begins with the dimerization of coniferyl alcohol, followed by the formation of dioxoles, oxidation, and glycosylation. Most genes of the lignan pathway in sesame have been identified but the inheritance of lignan content is poorly understood. Health-promoting properties make lignans attractive components of functional food. Lignans enhance the efficiency of insecticides and possess antifeedant activity, but their biological function in plants remains hypothetical. In this work, extensive literature including historical texts is reviewed, controversial issues are critically examined, and errors perpetuated in literature are corrected. The following aspects are covered: chemical properties and transformations of lignans; analysis, purification, and total synthesis; occurrence in <i>Seseamum indicum</i> and related plants; biosynthesis and genetics; biological activities; health-promoting properties; and biological functions. Finally, the improvement of lignan content in sesame seeds by breeding and biotechnology and the potential of hairy roots for manufacturing lignans in vitro are outlined."

      "In the present study, the essential oils obtained by hydrodistillation of the organs of <i>Eryngium maritimum</i> and <i>E. alpinum</i> were analyzed by GC-FID-MS. The dominant constituents assessed in the essential oil of <i>E. maritimum</i> were germacrene D (45.2%) in the fruits; hexadecanoic acid (18.5%), menthol (16.8%), and menthone (10.9%) in the roots; 2,3,4-trimethylbenzaldehyde (11.3%) and germacrene D (10.5%) in the leaves; 2,3,4-trimethylbenzaldehyde (11.3%) in the shoot culture. In the case of <i>E. alpinum</i>, the main components of the leaf oil were: β-elemenone (10.3%), germacrone (5.8%), two selinadienes (7.1% and 6.7%), and 1,8-cineole (5.3%), which were not found in the oil from shoot culture, whereas the shoot culture oil was dominated by hexadecanoic acid (15.5%), spathulenol (7.5%), (<i>E</i>)-β-farnesene (4.9%), germacra-4(15),5,10(14)-trien-1α-ol (4.7%), and falcarinol (4.3%). The essential oils obtained from <i>E. maritimum</i> fruits and leaves of the intact plants, measured by the broth microdilution method, were the most active against <i>T. mentagophytes</i> and <i>S. aureus</i>. Moreover, the essential oil of leaves had the moderate activity against <i>C. albicans</i> and <i>E. coli</i>. The results showed that the chemical compositions of the essential oils differed decidedly between the two studied species and between the organs. Furthermore, the essential oil of <i>E. maritimum</i> may play an important role as antimicrobial agent."

      "The use of chemical insecticides has had several side-effects, such as environmental contamination, foodborne residues, and human health threats. The utilization of plant-derived essential oils as efficient bio-rational agents has been acknowledged in pest management strategies. In the present study, the fumigant toxicity of essential oil isolated from Satureja intermedia was assessed against cosmopolitan stored-product insect pests: Trogoderma granarium Everts (khapra beetle), Rhyzopertha dominica (Fabricius) (lesser grain borer), Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) (red flour beetle), and Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L.) (saw-toothed grain beetle). The essential oil had significant fumigant toxicity against tested insects, which positively depended on essential oil concentrations and the exposure times. Comparative contact toxicity of S. intermedia essential oil was measured against Aphis nerii Boyer de Fonscolombe (oleander aphid) and its predator Coccinella septempunctata L. (seven-spot ladybird). Adult females of A. nerii were more susceptible to the contact toxicity than the C. septempunctata adults. The dominant compounds in the essential oil of S. intermedia were thymol (48.1%), carvacrol (11.8%), p-cymene (8.1%), and γ-terpinene (8.1%). The high fumigant toxicity against four major stored-product insect pests, the significant aphidicidal effect on A. nerii, and relative safety to the general predator C. septempunctata make terpene-rich S. intermedia essential oil a potential candidate for use as a plant-based alternative to the detrimental synthetic insecticides."

      "Plants in the genus <i>Melaleuca</i> have been widely used as traditional medicine mainly because of their broad spectrum antimicrobial activity. In this study, we reported the complete chloroplast genome of <i>Melaleuca cajuputi</i> subsp. <i>cumingiana</i>. The chloroplast genome of this species is 158,855 bp in length, including a pair of inverted repeat regions (IRs) (26,727 bp) that is divided by a large single-copy (LSC) area (87,338 bp) and a small single-copy (SSC) area (18,063 bp). The circular chloroplast genome of <i>M. cajuputi</i> subsp. <i>cumingiana</i> contains 135 unique genes, composing of 87 protein-coding genes, 40 tRNA genes, and eight rRNA genes. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that <i>M. cajuputi</i> subsp. <i>cumingiana</i> was clustered with species in the tribe Melaleuceae. This complete chloroplast genome of <i>M. cajuputi</i> subsp. <i>cumingiana</i> will provide a powerful tool to accelerate breeding, biotechnological and phylogenetic study."

      "The use of synthetic pesticide carries along several disadvantages talking about the preservation of the natural homeostasis of the planet, causing the searching of biopesticide, which one presents advantages as well as biodegradability in minimum possible time, the low toxicity in comparison to synthetic pesticides and their variety of structure, which allows slowing down the appearance of resistance. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect on the larvicidal action when artificially varying the chemical composition of orange oil (<i>Citrus sinensis</i> L.). As results, we found that the analysis of gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry showed the presence of terpenoid and sesquiterpenoid compounds in the different samples. The use of electric pulses on samples modified their chemical composition, so that the percentage of limonene went from 72% in the sample that was not subjected to electric treatment to lower percentages, even in sample three the percentage of limonene was <50%. Only three compounds (limonene, linalool and caryophyllene) were found to be common in all samples. Subsequently, the larvicidal action on <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> larvae was evaluated. Six concentrations of each oil sample were tested (0, 100, 500, 1000, 5000 and 10000 ppm). We found that there was no linear relationship between concentration and lethality. Additionally, in the sample without electrical treatment most of the concentrations tested had lethality higher than 50%, while in sample 7 the results of the lethality were lower than 30%, so that biological tests showed that in samples where the concentration of limonene was lower, the lethality in the larvae decreased."

      "The wastage of food products is a major challenge for the food industry. In this regard, the use of edible films and coatings have gained much attention due to their ability to prevent the spoilage of the food products during handling, transport, and storage. This has effectively helped in extending the shelf-life of the food products. Among the various polymers, polysaccharides have been explored to develop edible films and coatings in the last decade. Such polymeric systems have shown great promise in microbial food safety applications. The inclusion of essential oils (EOs) within the polysaccharide matrices has further improved the functional properties of the edible films and coatings. The current review will discuss the different types of polysaccharides, EOs, methods of preparing edible films and coatings, and the characterization methods for the EO-loaded polysaccharide films. The mechanism of the antimicrobial activity of the EOs has also been discussed in brief."

      "Over the past 20-30 years, <i>Trichophyton rubrum</i> represented the most widespread dermatophyte with a prevalence accounting for 70% of dermatophytosis. The treatment for cutaneous infections caused by <i>Trichophyton</i> spp. are imidazoles (ketoconazole (KTZ)) and triazoles (itraconazole (ITZ)). <i>T. rubrum</i> can develop resistance to azoles after prolonged exposure to subinhibitory concentrations resulting in therapeutic failures and chronic infections. These problems have stimulated the search for therapeutic alternatives, including essential oils, and their potential use in combination with conventional antifungals. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antifungal activity of tea tree oil (TTO) (<i>Melaleuca alternifolia</i> essential oil) and the main components against <i>T. rubrum</i> and to assess whether TTO in association with KTZ/ITZ as reference drugs improves the antifungal activity of these drugs. We used a terpinen-4-ol chemotype (35.88%) TTO, and its antifungal properties were evaluated by minimum inhibitory and minimum fungicidal concentrations in accordance with the CLSI guidelines. The interaction between TTO and azoles was evaluated through the checkerboard and isobologram methods. The results demonstrated both the fungicide activity of TTO on <i>T. rubrum</i> and the synergism when it was used in combination with azoles. Therefore, this mixture may reduce the minimum effective dose of azole required and minimize the side effects of the therapy. Synergy activity offered a promise for combination topical treatment for superficial mycoses."

      "<h4>Objectives</h4>The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of sesame oil therapy in reduction of dentin hypersensitivity, as compared to desensitizing dentifrice. <i>Design, setting, participants</i>. We conducted a single blinded randomized controlled trial in 100 patients reported to Diagnostic Department of King Khalid University-College of Dentistry between March 2018 and December 2019. <i>Interventions</i>. Patients were given desensitizing tooth paste or sesame oil to apply for the specified time. <i>Main outcome measures</i>. A Visual Analogue Scale was used to record sensitivity scores for controlled air stimulus and tactile method at the first visit and after 8th week of treatment. Measured outcome was reduction in dentinal hypersensitivity.<h4>Results</h4>Hypersensitivity degree before treatment in case of desensitizing tooth paste was 6.90 ± 1.04, and posttreatment showed a score of 4.70 ± 1.37. In case of sesame oil groups, subjects included had a score of 7.14 ± 0.90 which showed a drop to a score of 4.52 ± 1.16.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Desensitizing tooth paste showed 30.5% reduction in sensitivity, whereas sesame oil application showed 36.2% reduction. The belief of considering oil therapy in oral health is just a placebo effect and may not be considered anymore. Efficacy can be established with many more studies including long follow-up and varying time periods."

      "<i>Rhus coriaria</i> L. (Anacardiaceae), commonly known as sumac, is a commonly used spice, condiment, and flavoring agent, especially in the Mediterranean region. Owing to its bountiful beneficial values, sumac has been used in traditional medicine for the management and treatment of many ailments including hemorrhoids, wound healing, diarrhea, ulcer, and eye inflammation. This plant is rich in various classes of phytochemicals including flavonoids, tannins, polyphenolic compounds, organic acids, and many others. By virtue of its bioactive, <i>Rhus coriaria</i> possesses powerful antioxidant capacities that have ameliorative and therapeutic benefits for many common diseases including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. This review describes the phytochemical properties of <i>R. coriaria</i> and then focuses on the potent antioxidant capacities of sumac. We then dissect the cellular and molecular mechanisms of sumac's action in modulating many pathophysiological instigators. We show how accumulating evidence supports the antibacterial, antinociceptive, antidiabetic, cardioprotective, neuroprotective, and anticancer effects of this plant, especially that toxicity studies show that sumac is very safe to consume by humans and has little toxicity. Taken together, the findings we summarize here support the utilization of this plant as an attractive target for drug discovery."

      "This study evaluated the chemical compositions of the leaves and fruits of eight black pepper cultivars cultivated in Pará State (Amazon, Brazil). Hydrodistillation and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry were employed to extract and analyze the volatile compounds, respectively. Sesquiterpene hydrocarbons were predominant (58.5-90.9%) in the cultivars \"Cingapura\", \"Equador\", \"Guajarina\", \"Iaçará\", and \"Kottanadan\", and \"Bragantina\", \"Clonada\", and \"Uthirankota\" displayed oxygenated sesquiterpenoids (50.6-75.0%). The multivariate statistical analysis applied using volatile composition grouped the samples into four groups: γ-Elemene, curzerene, and δ-elemene (\"Equador\"/\"Guajarina\", I); δ-elemene (\"Iaçará\"/\"Kottanadan\"/\"Cingapura\", II); elemol (\"Clonada\"/\"Uthirankota\", III) and α-muurolol, bicyclogermacrene, and cubebol (\"Bragantina\", IV). The major compounds in all fruit samples were monoterpene hydrocarbons such as α-pinene, β-pinene, and limonene. Among the cultivar leaves, phenolics content (44.75-140.53 mg GAE·g<sup>-1</sup> FW), the enzymatic activity of phenylalanine-ammonia lyase (20.19-57.22 µU·mL<sup>-1</sup>), and carotenoids (0.21-2.31 µg·mL<sup>-1</sup>) displayed significant variations. Due to black pepper's susceptibility to <i>Fusarium</i> infection, a molecular docking analysis was carried out on <i>Fusarium</i> protein targets using each cultivar's volatile components. <i>F. oxysporum</i> endoglucanase was identified as the preferential protein target of the compounds. These results can be used to identify chemical markers related to the susceptibility degree of black pepper cultivars to plant diseases prevalent in Pará State."

      "Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] was domesticated from wild soybean (G. soja Sieb. and Zucc.) and has been further improved as a dual-use seed crop to provide highly valuable oil and protein for food, feed, and industrial applications. However, the underlying genetic and molecular basis remains less understood. Having combined high-confidence bi-parental linkage mapping with high-resolution association analysis based on 631 whole sequenced genomes, we mapped major soybean protein and oil QTLs on chromosome15 to a sugar transporter gene (GmSWEET39). A two-nucleotide CC deletion truncating C-terminus of GmSWEET39 was strongly associated with high seed oil and low seed protein, suggesting its pleiotropic effect on protein and oil content. GmSWEET39 was predominantly expressed in parenchyma and integument of the seed coat, and likely regulates oil and protein accumulation by affecting sugar delivery from maternal seed coat to the filial embryo. We demonstrated that GmSWEET39 has a dual function for both oil and protein improvement and undergoes two different paths of artificial selection. A CC deletion (CC-) haplotype H1 has been intensively selected during domestication and extensively used in soybean improvement worldwide. H1 is fixed in North American soybean cultivars. The protein-favored (CC+) haplotype H3 still undergoes ongoing selection, reflecting its sustainable role for soybean protein improvement. The comprehensive knowledge on the molecular basis underlying the major QTL and GmSWEET39 haplotypes associated with soybean improvement would be valuable to design new strategies for soybean seed quality improvement using molecular breeding and biotechnological approaches."

      "Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infection of the respiratory system caused by single standard RNA viruses named as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease appeared as a serious problem and the leading cause of death in human beings throughout the world. The main source of different phytochemicals are plants, which helps in the development of new drugs against various ailments. Islam is comprehensive religion and a complete code of life for Muslims. The teaching of Islam, according to the Holy Quran and Hadith are universal for the benefit of humanity. Islam believes that every ailment is from God and who made the disease definitely made its medication. There is a complete guideline with regard to taking measures against infectious diseases such as quarantine and seeking medicinal treatment. The research objective is to gather the knowledge of medicinal plants described in the Holy Quran or utilized by the Prophet (SAW) for the treatment of different ailments or advised to use them to boost immunity and strengthen the body. Scientists across the globe have found these plants beneficial for many diseases and have antiviral potential. In present study, the six plant species including <i>Olea europaea , Nigella sativa, Allium Sativum, Allium cepa, Zingiber officinale</i> and <i>Cassia senna</i> were selected which contain phytochemicals like Calcium Elenolate, Thymoquinone, S-Allylcysteine, Dipropyl Disulfide, Sesquiterpene, Monoterpene, Pelargonidin 3-Galactoside ion and Kaempferol. The phytochemicals monoterpene (from <i>Zingiber officinale</i>) shows best interaction with target proteins RdRP, 3CLPro, ACE2. Calcium Elonate (from olive) bonds with 3CLPro, ACE2 and Kemoferol and Pelargomidine (from Senna Makki) bonds with RdRP, ACE2. The ligands show a unique set of intersections i.e. hydrogen bonding, and alkyl interaction. These medicinal plants can be utilized immediately for the treatment of COVID-19 as their safety is already established. This treatment can enhance recovery when combined with other treatments. Furthermore, the screening of bioactive compounds or phytochemicals found in these plants can be utilized to design new therapeutic drug to treat COVID-19 pandemic."

      "The strong spread of COVID-19 and the significant number of deaths associated with it could be related to improper lifestyles, which lead to a low-grade inflammation (LGI) that not only increases the risk of chronic diseases, but also the risk of facing complications relating to infections and a greater susceptibility to infections themselves. Recently, scientific research has widely demonstrated that the microbiota plays a fundamental role in modulating metabolic responses in the immune system. There is, in fact, a two-way interaction between lifestyle, infection, and immunity. The immune response is compromised if nutrition is unbalanced or insufficient, because diet affects the intestinal flora predisposing people to infections and, at the same time, the nutritional state can be aggravated by the immune response itself to the infection. We evaluate the link between balanced diet, the efficiency of the immune system, and microbiota with the aim of providing some practical advice for individuals, with special attention to the elderly. A correct lifestyle that follows the Mediterranean model, which is especially rich in plant-based foods along with the use of extra-virgin olive oil, are the basis of preventing LGI and other chronic pathologies, directly influencing the intestinal microbiota and consequently the immune response."

      "(E)-β-caryophyllene (BCP) is a natural sesquiterpene hydrocarbon present in hundreds of plant species. BCP possesses several important pharmacological activities, ranging from pain treatment to neurological and metabolic disorders. These are mainly due to its ability to interact with the cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) and the complete lack of interaction with the brain CB1. A systematic analysis of plant species with essential oils containing a BCP percentage > 10% provided almost 300 entries with species belonging to 51 families. The essential oils were found to be extracted from 13 plant parts and samples originated from 56 countries worldwide. Statistical analyses included the evaluation of variability in BCP% and yield% as well as the statistical linkage between families, plant parts and countries of origin by cluster analysis. Identified species were also grouped according to their presence in the Belfrit list. The survey evidences the importance of essential oil yield evaluation in support of the chemical analysis. The results provide a comprehensive picture of the species with the highest BCP and yield percentages."

      "<i>Aniba rosiodora</i> has been exploited since the end of the nineteenth century for its essential oil, a valuable ingredient in the perfumery industry. This species occurs mainly in Northern South America, and the morphological similarity among different <i>Aniba</i> species often leads to misidentification, which impacts the consistency of products obtained from these plants. Hence, we compared the profiles of volatile organic compounds (essential oils) and non-volatile organic compounds (methanolic extracts) of two populations of <i>A. rosiodora</i> from the RESEX and FLONA conservation units, which are separated by the Tapajós River in Western Pará State. The phytochemical profile indicated a substantial difference between the two populations: samples from RESEX present α-phellandrene (22.8%) and linalool (39.6%) in their essential oil composition, while samples from FLONA contain mainly linalool (83.7%). The comparison between phytochemical profiles and phylogenetic data indicates a clear difference, implying genetic distinction between these populations."

      "This investigation included the chemical analysis of <i>Peganum harmala</i> (<i>P. harmala</i>) seed oil and its antifungal properties against 10 fungal species. Seed oils of six populations were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatograph/mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The HPLC analysis indicated that <i>P</i>. <i>harmala</i> seed oil exhibited a very high level of tocopherol contents, with values in the range of 2385.66-2722.68 mg/100 g. The most abundant tocopherol isomer was δ-tocopherol (90.39%), followed by γ-tocopherol (8.08%) and α-tocopherol (1.14%). We discovered for the first time the presence of tocotrenols in <i>P. harmala</i> seed oils of the six populations studied. The GC-MS analyses revealed that linoleic acid was the main fatty acid (65.17%), followed by oleic acid (23.12%), palmitic acid (5.36%) and stearic acid (3.08%). We also studied the antifungal activity of seed oil of the Medenine (MD) population on ten fungal pathogens. The antifungal effects differed among pathogens and depended on oil concentrations. Seed oil of the MD population caused a significant decrease in mycelial growth of all fungi tested, with values ranging 31.50-82.11%, except for <i>Alternaria</i> sp., which showed no inhibition. The antifungal activity against the 10 selected fungi can be explained by the richness in tocols of the extracted oil and make <i>P. harmala</i> a promising crop for biological control. Furthermore, the importance of fatty acids and the wide geographic spread in Tunisia of this species make this crop a potential source of renewable energy."

      "The disposal of food waste is a current and pressing issue, urging novel solutions to implement sustainable waste management practices. Fish leftovers and their processing byproducts represent a significant portion of the original fish, and their disposal has a high environmental and economic impact. The utilization of waste as raw materials for the production of different classes of biofuels and high-value chemicals, a concept known as \"biorefinery\", is gaining interest in a vision of circular economy and zero waste policies. In this context, an interesting route of valorization is the extraction of omega-3 fatty acids (ω-3 FAs) for nutraceutical application. These fatty acids, such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have received attention over the last decades due to their beneficial effects on human health. Their sustainable production is a key process for matching the increased market demand while reducing the pressure on marine ecosystems and lowering the impact of waste production. The high resale value of the products makes this waste a powerful tool that simultaneously protects the environment and benefits the global economy. This review aims to provide a complete overview of the sustainable exploitation of fish waste to recover ω-3 FAs for food supplement applications, covering composition, storage, and processing of the raw material."

      "<b>Background</b>: <i>Pimenta dioica</i> is a native tree of Central America, Southern Mexico, and the Caribbean used in traditional medicine. It grows in wet forests in the Guatemalan departments of Petén and Izabal. Since the plant is not being economically exploited in Guatemala, this study was aimed at determining the composition of the essential oil of <i>P. dioica</i> leaves and fruits and the antibacterial activity of the leaves in order to evaluate its possible use in health products. The essential oils of fruits and leaves are used as rubefacient, anti-inflammatory, carminative, antioxidant, and antiflatulent in different countries. Fruits and leaves of <i>P. dioica</i> from Izabal Department were collected in April 2014 and extracted by hydrodistillation method. The oils were analyzed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Yields of 1.02 ± 0.11% for dried leaves and 1.51 ± 0.26% for fruits were obtained. Eugenol was the main component (65.9-71.4%). The leaf oil showed growth inhibition against two Gram-positive and two Gram-negative bacteria. The authors consider that the tree's leaves can be evaluated as a source of ingredients for antiseptic products, and that it is important to evaluate other types of properties such as anti-inflammatory activity."

      "The aim of this study was to evaluate how the inclusion of a blend of essential oils in milk replacer (MR) affects different outcomes of dairy heifers. The outcomes evaluated: feed intake, performance, body development, blood cells and metabolites, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), rumen fermentation, fecal scores, and respiratory scores. All outcomes were evaluated during pre-weaning (4-60 d of age), and carry-over effects during post-weaning (61-90 d of age) periods. The experimental units utilized were 29 newborn Holstein × Gyr crossbred dairy heifers, with genetic composition of 5/8 or more Holstein and 3/8 or less Gyr and body weight (BW) at birth of 32.2 ± 5.2 kg. Experimental units were assigned to either a control (CON, n = 15) or a blend of essential oil supplementation (BEO, n = 14) treatment, maintaining a balance of genetic composition. The BEO was supplemented in the MR with 1 g/d/calf of a blend of essential oils (Apex Calf, Adisseo, China) composed by plant extracts derived from anise, cinnamon, garlic, rosemary, and thyme. During the pre-weaning phase, all heifers were fed 5 L of MR/d reconstituted to 15% (dry matter basis), divided into two equal meals. Water and starter were provided ad libitum. During the post-weaning, animals received a maximum of 3 kg of starter/d, and ad libitum corn silage, divided into two meals. Feed intake, fecal and respiratory scores were evaluated daily. The BW was measured every three days, while body development was recorded weekly. Blood samples were collected on 0, 30, and 60 d of age for total blood cell count, weekly and on the weaning day to determinate ß-hydroxybutyrate, urea and glucose, and biweekly for IGF-1. Ruminal parameters (pH, volatile fatty acids, ammonia-N, and acetate:propionate proportion-C2:C3) were measured on days 14, 28, 42, 60, 74 and 90. A randomized complete block design with an interaction between treatment and week was the experimental method of choice to test the hypothesis of the BEO's effect on all outcomes. An ANOVA procedure was used for continuous outcomes, and a non-parametric test was used for the ordered categorical outcomes, both adopting a CI = 95%. Results indicated that there was not enough evidence to accept the alternative hypothesis of the effect of BEO in MR on feed intake, performance, body development, and blood metabolites during both pre-weaning and post-weaning periods. However, results indicated that the inclusion of BEO in MR significantly affects the proportion of C2:C3 during pre- and post-weaning (P = 0.05). Similarly, the effect was significant for basophil (P ≤ 0.001), and platelet (P = 0.04) counts pre-weaning. The interaction between week and treatment was also significant for lymphocytes (P ≤ 0.001), revealing a cumulative effect. Lastly, fecal scores were also significant (P = 0.04) during pre-weaning, with lower values for BEO. The BEO contributed to ruminal manipulation in pre-weaning and carry-over effects in post-weaning, immunity improvement, and decreased morbidity of neonatal diarrhea in the pre-weaning phase."

      "<i>Salvia officinalis</i> L. (sage) is one of the most appreciated plants for its plethora of biologically active compounds. The objective of our research was a comparative study, in the Mediterranean context, of chemical composition, anticholinesterases, and antioxidant properties of essential oils (EOs) from sage collected in three areas (S1-S3) of Southern Italy. EOs were extracted by hydrodistillation and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitory properties were investigated by employing Ellman's method. Four in vitro assays, namely, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), ferric-reducing ability power (FRAP), and β-carotene bleaching tests, were used to study the antioxidant effects. Camphor (16.16-18.92%), 1,8-cineole (8.80-9.86%), β-pinene (3.08-9.14%), camphene (6.27-8.08%), and α-thujone (1.17-9.26%) are identified as the most abundant constituents. However, the content of these constituents varied depending on environmental factors and pedoclimatic conditions. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed. Based on Relative Antioxidant Capacity Index (RACI), S2 essential oil exhibited the highest radical potential with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 20.64 μg/mL in ABTS test and presented the highest protection of lipid peroxidation with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 38.06 and 46.32 μg/mL after 30 and 60 min of incubation, respectively. The most promising inhibitory activity against BChE was found for S3 sample (IC<sub>50</sub> of 33.13 μg/mL)."

      "Using plant essential oils (EOs) contributes to the growing number of natural plants' applications in livestock. Scientific data supporting the efficacy of EOs as anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and antioxidant molecules accumulates over time; however, the cumulative evidence is not always sufficient. EOs antioxidant properties have been investigated mainly from human perspectives. Still, so far, our review is the first to combine the beneficial supporting properties of EOs in a One Health approach and as an animal product quality enhancer, opening new possibilities for their utilization in the livestock and nutrition sectors. We aim to compile the currently available data on the main anti-inflammatory effects of EOs, whether encapsulated or not, with a focus on mammary gland inflammation. We will also review the EOs' antioxidant activities when given in the diet or as a food preservative to counteract oxidative stress. We emphasize EOs' in vitro and in vivo ruminal microbiota and mechanisms of action to promote animal health and performance. Given the concept of DOHaD (Developmental Origin of Health and Diseases), supplementing animals with EOs in early life opens new perspectives in the nutrition sector. However, effective evaluation of the significant safety components is required before extending their use to livestock and veterinary medicine."

      "In this study, tansy (Tanacetum vulgare L.) in vitro culture was established from seeds collected from natural populations. The multiplication of plantlets was conducted through shoot tips that exhibited potent apical growth and regeneration capacities on basal medium (BM), without the addition of any plant growth regulators (PGRs). PGRs were also omitted for the establishment and cultivation of tansy root cultures. Both abaxial and adaxial leaf surfaces of in vitro micropropagated plantlets were covered with glandular biseriate trichomes. Histochemical staining showed that glandular secretions were rich in lipid and terpene compounds, confirmed by GC-MS analysis of essential oil (EO). In the total EO, similar portions of oxygenated monoterpenes (38.5% m/m) and oxygenated sesquiterpenes (22.6% m/m) were detected. Chemical profiles of methanol extracts of in vitro cultured tansy shoots and roots varied in quantity and quality from those obtained from wild-growingtansy. HPLC analysis indicated that the methanol extracts of in vitro cultured roots were the richest in 3,5-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid (3,5-O-DCQA), in which the concentration was 6 times higher (10.220 mg/g DW) than that in the extract obtained from roots of wild-growing tansy (1.684 mg/g DW). This result is noticeable in the manner of industrial production of biologically active 3,5-O-DCQA that has been shown to have antioxidant, hepatoprotective, antiviral, antimutagenic, and immunomodulatory activity. Biotechnological interventions on secondary metabolite production taking place in trichomes could further enhance the production of some important tansy metabolites and further investigation will be directed toward the elucidation of the pharmaceutical potential of tansy in vitro obtained metabolites, as mixtures or single moieties."

      "Satureja hortensis is one of the representative plants from the Lamiaceae family, and its essential oil has been used in various applicative fields, from the food industry to aromatherapy. The changes that occur in heated samples at different temperatures (160, 175, 190 ºC) over different periods (0.5 and 2.5 h) in Satureja hortensis essential oil composition and chemical properties were evaluated. The results showed that the major chemical composition constituents of the investigated essential oil are γ-terpinene + α-terpinolene and carvacrol + p-cymene and the thermal behavior is dependent on the content. This composition drastically changes through the heating of the samples and causes significant changes in thermal behavior. The present study demonstrated that the concentration of carvacrol in S. hortensis essential oil is increasing after heating treatment, and the sample heated at 190 ºC for 2.5 h contained more than 91% carvacrol. This simple treatment is a rapid way to obtain carvacrol from the essential oil that has high potential as a natural preservative suitable for the food industry and alternative and complementary medicine."

      "Bovine mastitis is the most widespread and economically important disease worldwide. The present study aimed to determine bioactive compounds in two essential oils (EOs) from wild <i>(Thymus serpyllum)</i> and common thyme <i>(Thymus vulgaris)</i> and to assess the antioxidant potential as well as antibacterial efficacy of the EOs against mastitis-associated bacteria. The study also included antibiotic susceptibility tests. The strains were previously isolated from lactating animals with clinical and subclinical mastitis. The antioxidant potential of the commercial EOs of wild and common thyme was evaluated by five in vitro assays. The antibacterial activity was performed using the microdilution technique, while antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed by the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. The dominant compound in wild thyme was thymol (45.22%), followed by <i>p</i>-cymene (23.83%) and γ-terpinene (3.12%), while in common thyme, it was thymol (54.17%), followed by γ-terpinene (22.18%) and <i>p</i>-cymene (16.66%). Among the fourteen mastitis-associated bacteria, strain IX <i>Streptococcus</i> spp. (β-hemolytic) was the most sensitive to the tested EOs (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)/minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) were 0.78/1.56 and 0.39/0.78 mg/mL for <i>T. serpyllum</i> (TS) and <i>T. vulgaris (TV)</i>, respectively). Regarding <i>Streptococcus</i> spp. β heamoliticus, MICs for <i>TS</i> ranged from 0.78 to 1.56 mg/mL, while for the same oil, MBCs ranged from 1.56 to 12.5 mg/mL. In the case of <i>T. vulgaris,</i> MICs ranged from 0.39 to 3.125 mg/ mL, while MBCs ranged from 3.125 to 6.25 mg/mL. TV is more active against <i>E. coli, E. sakazakii,</i> and <i>Streptococcus</i> spp., while it is less effective against <i>Staphylococcus</i> spp. than TS. The study revealed that the tested EOs possess remarkable antioxidative and antibacterial activities and could be used in the development of pharmaceutical formulation as an alternative to conventional mastitis therapy."

      "Targeted and untargeted selections including domestication and breeding efforts can reduce genetic diversity in breeding germplasm and create selective sweeps in crop genomes. The genomic regions at which selective sweeps are detected can reveal important information about signatures of selection. We have analyzed the genetic diversity within a soybean germplasm collection relevant for breeding in Europe (the EUCLEG collection), and have identified selective sweeps through a genome-wide scan comparing that collection to Chinese soybean collections. This work involved genotyping of 480 EUCLEG soybean accessions, including 210 improved varieties, 216 breeding lines and 54 landraces using the 355K SoySNP microarray. SNP calling of 477 EUCLEG accessions together with 328 Chinese soybean accessions identified 224,993 high-quality SNP markers. Population structure analysis revealed a clear differentiation between the EUCLEG collection and the Chinese materials. Further, the EUCLEG collection was sub-structured into five subgroups that were differentiated by geographical origin. No clear association between subgroups and maturity group was detected. The genetic diversity was lower in the EUCLEG collection compared to the Chinese collections. Selective sweep analysis revealed 23 selective sweep regions distributed over 12 chromosomes. Co-localization of these selective sweep regions with previously reported QTLs and genes revealed that various signatures of selection in the EUCLEG collection may be related to domestication and improvement traits including seed protein and oil content, phenology, nitrogen fixation, yield components, diseases resistance and quality. No signatures of selection related to stem determinacy were detected. In addition, absence of signatures of selection for a substantial number of QTLs related to yield, protein content, oil content and phenological traits suggests the presence of substantial genetic diversity in the EUCLEG collection. Taken together, the results obtained demonstrate that the available genetic diversity in the EUCLEG collection can be further exploited for research and breeding purposes. However, incorporation of exotic material can be considered to broaden its genetic base."

      "Hemp (<i>Cannabis sativa</i> L.) is currently one of the most controversial and promising crops. This study compared nine wild hemp (<i>C. sativa</i> spp. <i>spontanea</i> V.) accessions with 13 registered cultivars, eight breeding lines, and one cannabidiol (CBD) hemp strain belonging to <i>C. sativa</i> L. The first three groups had similar main essential oil (EO) constituents, but in different concentrations; the CBD hemp had a different EO profile. The concentration of the four major constituents in the industrial hemp lines and wild hemp accessions varied as follows: β-caryophyllene 11-22% and 15.4-29.6%; α-humulene 4.4-7.6% and 5.3-11.9%; caryophyllene oxide 8.6-13.7% and 0.2-31.2%; and humulene epoxide 2, 2.3-5.6% and 1.2-9.5%, respectively. The concentration of CBD in the EO of wild hemp varied from 6.9 to 52.4% of the total oil while CBD in the EO of the registered cultivars varied from 7.1 to 25%; CBD in the EO of the breeding lines and in the CBD strain varied from 6.4 to 25% and 7.4 to 8.8%, respectively. The concentrations of δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in the EO of the three groups of hemp were significantly different, with the highest concentration being 3.5%. The EO of wild hemp had greater antimicrobial activity compared with the EO of registered cultivars. This is the first report to show that significant amounts of CBD could be accumulated in the EO of wild and registered cultivars of hemp following hydro-distillation. The amount of CBD in the EO can be greater than that in the EO of the USA strain used for commercial production of CBD. Furthermore, this is among the first reports that show greater antimicrobial activity of the EO of wild hemp vs. the EO of registered cultivars. The results suggest that wild hemp may offer an excellent opportunity for future breeding and the selection of cultivars with a desirable composition of the EO and possibly CBD-rich EO production."

      "Essential oils are used in an increasing number of applications including biopesticides. Their volatility minimizes the risk of residue but can also be a constraint if the release is rapid and uncontrolled. Solutions allowing the encapsulation of essential oils are therefore strongly researched. In this study, essential oils encapsulation was carried out within dendrimers to control their volatility. Indeed, a spontaneous complexation occurs in a solution of dendrimers with essential oils which maintains it longer. Six parameters (temperature, stirring rate, relative concentration, solvent volume, stirring time, and pH) of this reaction has been optimized by two steps: first a screening of the parameters that influence the encapsulation with a Plackett-Burmann design the most followed by an optimization of those ones by a surface response methodology. In this study, two essential oils with herbicide properties were used: the essential oils of <i>Cinnamomum zeylanicum</i> Blume and <i>Cymbopogon</i>\n                                                                                                                                                        <i>winterianus</i> Jowitt; and four biosourced dendrimers: glycerodendrimers derived from polypropylenimine and polyamidoamine, a glyceroclikdendrimer, and a glyceroladendrimer. Meta-analysis of all Plackett-Burman assays determined that rate and stirring time were effective on the retention rate thereby these parameters were used for the surface response methodology part. Each combination gives a different optimum depending on the structure of these molecules."

      "One of the most controversial areas of nutrition research relates to fats, particularly essential fatty acids, in the context of cardiovascular disease risk. A critical feature of dietary fatty acids is that they incorporate into the plasma membrane, modifying fluidity and key physiological functions. Importantly, they can reshape the bioavailability of eicosanoids and other lipid mediators, which direct cellular responses to external stimuli, such as inflammation and chronic stress conditions. This paper provides an overview of the most recent evidence, as well as historical controversies, linking fat consumption with human health and disease. We underscore current pitfalls in the area of fatty acid research and critically frame fatty acid intake in the larger context of diet and behavior. We conclude that fundamental research on fatty acids and lipids is appropriate in certain areas, but the rigor and reproducibility are lacking in others. The pros and cons are highlighted throughout the review, seeking to guide future research on the important area of nutrition, fat intake, and cardiovascular disease risk."

      "This paper reports data from a characterization study conducted on the unsaponifiable lipid fraction of dry-grind corn bioethanol side streams. Phytosterols, squalene, tocopherols, tocotrienols, and carotenoids were quantified by High Performance Liquid Chromatography with Diode-Array Detector (HPLC-DAD) and Liquid Chromatography-tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in different lots of post-fermentation corn oil and thin stillage collected from a bioethanol plant over a time-span of one year. Fat-soluble bioactives were present at high levels in corn oil, with a prevalence of plant sterols over tocols and squalene. Beta-sitosterol and sitostanol accounted altogether for more than 60% of total sterols. The carotenoid profile was that typical of corn, with lutein and zeaxanthin as the prevalent molecules. The unsaponifiable lipid fraction profile of thin stillage was qualitatively similar to that of post-fermentation corn oil but, in quantitative terms, the amounts of valuable biomolecules were much lower because of the very high dilution of this side stream. Results indicate that post-fermentation corn oil is a promising and sustainable source of health-promoting bioactive molecules. The concomitant presence of a variegate complex of bioactive molecules with high antioxidant potentialities and their potential multifaceted market applications as functional ingredients for food, nutraceutical, and cosmeceutical formulations, make the perspective of their recovery a promising strategy to create new bio-based value chains and maximize the sustainability of corn dry-grind bioethanol biorefineries."

      "Spray drying of emulsions is a promising way of increasing their durability, offering the possibility of reconstitution, with the addition of water. The present study aimed to examine the properties of flaxseed oil cake extract (FOCE) as an emulsifying and stabilizing agent for spray-dried reconstituted oil-in-water emulsions. Maltodextrin: starch: flaxseed oil emulsions with FOCE or distilled water as liquid phases, and 10% and 20% of oil were spray-dried at 180 °C. The solubility, flowability, cohesiveness, bulk, and tapped densities of the spray-dried powders were analyzed. Additionally, the characteristics of initial and reconstituted emulsions, such as stability, creaming index, color, particle size, and rheological properties were evaluated. Results showed that FOCE could be an adequate emulsifier for spray-dried emulsions with a high oil content providing high stability after reconstitution, when compared to emulsions based only on maltodextrin-starch wall material with water as the liquid phase. This study showed an encouraging way for producing natural and plant-based spray-dried oil-loaded emulsions for food applications."

      "The <i>Hyalomma</i> species of ticks have gained additional attention due to their role in the transmission of <i>Theileria annulata</i> infection in animals and the Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) virus in humans. Apart from these, many other pathogens viz., other species of <i>Theileria</i>, a few species of <i>Babesia, Rickettsia</i> and viruses are either maintained or transmitted by this tick species. The medium to large size species with longer proboscis has inflicted additional burden on the overall impact of tick infestations. Being a multi-host species, management of the species is very challenging. Presently, the traditional method of tick management using chemical acaricides is found insufficient and unsustainable. Henceforth, the overall burden of tick infestations and tick-borne diseases are increasing gradually. After the successful development of vaccines against cattle tick, <i>Rhipicephalus microplus</i>, the anti-<i>Hyalomma</i> vaccine is considered a feasible and sustainable management option. In the recent past research on herbal acaricides and its possible application for tick control seems promising. Other eco-friendly methods are still under experimental stage. The present review is focused on impact of <i>Hyalomma</i> species infestation on human and animal health with special emphasis on progress on its sustainable management."

      "The extensive use of chemical pesticides leads to risks for both the environment and human health due to the toxicity and poor biodegradability that they may present. Farmers therefore need alternative agricultural practices including the use of natural molecules to achieve more sustainable production methods to meet consumer and societal expectations. Numerous studies have reported the potential of essential oils as biopesticides for integrated weed or pest management. However, their phytotoxic properties have long been a major drawback for their potential applicability (apart from herbicidal application). Therefore, deciphering the mode of action of essential oils exogenously applied in regards to their potential phytotoxicity will help in the development of biopesticides for sustainable agriculture. Nowadays, plant physiologists are attempting to understand the mechanisms underlying their phytotoxicity at both cellular and molecular levels using transcriptomic and metabolomic tools. This review systematically discusses the functional and cellular impacts of essential oils applied in the agronomic context. Putative molecular targets and resulting physiological disturbances are described. New opportunities regarding the development of biopesticides are discussed including biostimulation and defense elicitation or priming properties of essential oils."

      "Essential oils (EO) are a great antimicrobial resource against bacterial resistance in public health. Math models are useful in describing the growth, survival, and inactivation of microorganisms against antimicrobials. We evaluated the antimicrobial activity of <i>Melaleuca armillaris</i> EO obtained from plants placed in the province of Buenos Aires (Argentina) against <i>Staphylococcus aureus.</i> The minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations were close and decreased, slightly acidifying the medium from pH 7.4 to 6.5 and 5.0. This result was also evidenced by applying a sigmoid model, where the time and EO concentration necessaries to achieve 50% of the maximum effect decreased when the medium was acidified. Moreover, at pH 7.4, applying the Gompertz model, we found that subinhibitory concentrations of EO decreased the growth rate and the maximum population density and increased the latency period concerning the control. Additionally, we established physicochemical parameters for quality control and standardization of <i>M. armillaris</i> EO. Mathematical modeling allowed us to estimate key parameters in the behavior of <i>S. aureus</i> and <i>Melaleuca armillaris</i> EO at different pH. This is interesting in situations where the pH changes are relevant, such as the control of intracellular infections in public health or the development of preservatives for the food industry."

      "Palm kernel cake (PKC), a by-product of oil extracted from palm nuts through expeller press or solvent extraction procedures is one of the highest quantities of locally available and potentially inexpensive agricultural product. PKC provides approximately 14-18% of crude protein (CP), 12-20% crude fiber (CF), 3-9% ether extract (EE), and different amounts of various minerals that feasible to be used as a partial substitute of soybean meal (SBM) and corn in poultry nutrition. Poultry's digestibility is reported to be compromised due to the indigestion of the high fiber content, making PKC potentially low for poultry feeding. Nevertheless, solid-state fermentation (SSF) can be applied to improve the nutritional quality of PKC by improving the CP and reducing CF content. PKC also contains β-mannan polysaccharide, which works as a prebiotic. However, there is a wide variation for the inclusion level of PKC in the broiler diet. These variations may be due to the quality of PKC, its sources, processing methods and value-added treatment. It has been documented that 10-15% of treated PKC could be included in the broiler's diets. The inclusion levels will not contribute to a negative impact on the growth performances and carcass yield. Furthermore, it will not compromise intestinal microflora, morphology, nutrient digestibility, and immune system. PKC with a proper SSF process (FPKC) can be offered up to 10-15% in the diets without affecting broilers' production performance."

      "For more than a thousand years, Rhizoma Curcumae (known as E zhu), a Chinese herbal medicine, has been used to eradicate blood stasis and relieve aches. The plant Curcuma wenyujin, which is grown primarily in Wenzhou, China, is considered the best source of Rhizoma Curcumae. In this study, we sought to ascertain differences in transcript profiles of C. wenyujin grown in traditional (Wenzhou) and recently established (Haikou) production areas based on Illumina and RNA (RNA-seq) sequencing. We also examined differences in the main components of the volatile oil terpene; curcumin, polysaccharide, and starch constituents and related genes in the corresponding pathways, in C. wenyujin cultivated in the two production areas. We accordingly found that the essential oil (2.05%), curcumin (1.46%), and polysaccharide (8.90%) content in Wenzhou rhizomes was higher than that in the rhizomes of plants from Haikou (1.60%, 0.91%, and 6.15%, respectively). In contrast, the starch content of Wenzhou rhizomes (17.0%) was lower than that of Haikou rhizomes (23.8%). Furthermore, we detected significant differences in the oil components of Haikou and Wenzhou rhizomes, with curzerene (32.34%), curdione (21.35%), and germacrene B (9.39%) being the primary components of the essential oil derived from Wenzhou rhizomes, and curzerene (20.13%), curdione (14.73%), and cineole (9.76%) being the main constituents in Haikou rhizomes. Transcriptome and qPCR analyses revealed considerable differences in gene expression between Wenzhou and Haikou rhizomes. The expression of terpene, curcumin, and polysaccharide pathway-related genes in Wenzhou rhizomes was significantly up-regulated, whereas the expression of starch-associated genes was significantly down-regulated, compared with those in Haikou rhizomes. Difference in the content of terpene, curcumin, polysaccharides, and starch in rhizomes from the two production areas could be explained in terms of differences in expression of the related genes."

      "Thyme is one of the most important medicinal plants because of its ethnopharmacological relevance and high content of bioactive compounds. This review focuses particularly on thyme as an alternative natural antioxidant and antimicrobial with potential use in the food industry. This is in line with the preferences of the current consumer, who demands healthier and more natural products. Different studies have concluded that the use of thyme increases stability and reduces lipid oxidation during the shelf-life period of foods (meat, meat products, milk, fish or fish products), which makes thyme a promising source of natural additives. Despite these findings, the use of <i>Thymus</i> extracts or essential oils as natural additives in foods is reduced in comparison with other natural preservative extracts. This review provides an overview of the most important information on the positive effect of the bioactive compounds of thyme and its uses as a preservative in foods, taking into account its origin (from plants, plant extracts or essential oils)."

      "<i>Solidago virgaurea</i> L. (European goldenrod, Woundwort), Asteraceae, is a familiar medicinal plant in Europe and other parts of the world, widely used and among the most researched species from its genus. The aerial parts of European goldenrod have long been used for urinary tract conditions and as an anti-inflammatory agent in the traditional medicine of different peoples. Its main chemical constituents are flavonoids (mainly derived from quercetin and kaempferol), C6-C1 and C6-C3 compounds, terpenes (mostly from the essential oil), and a large number of saponin molecules (mainly virgaureasaponins and solidagosaponins). Published research on its potential activities is critically reviewed here: antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, spasmolitic, antihypertensive, diuretic, antibacterial, antifungal, antiparasite, cytotoxic and antitumor, antimutagenic, antiadipogenic, antidiabetic, cardioprotective, and antisenescence. The evidence concerning its potential benefits is mainly derived from non-clinical studies, some effects are rather modest, whereas others are more promising, but need more confirmation in both non-clinical models and clinical trials."

      "One of the principal etiological agents associated with losses in horticultural crops is the fungus <i>Colletotrichum</i> sp. This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro effectiveness of the essential oil (EO) from <i>Cymbopogon citratus</i> in chitosan supports for the control of <i>Colletotrichum gloeosporioides</i> isolated from sweet pepper plants.<h4>Methods</h4>The extraction and phytochemical analysis of the EO of <i>C. citratus</i> were performed along with its encapsulation in chitosan-agar in order to compare it with other techniques and determine its effect on <i>C. gloeosporioides</i>.<h4>Results</h4>The EO from the citral chemotype (58%) encapsulated in the chitosan-agar, with an 83% encapsulation efficiency in mass percentage, resulted in the total inhibition of mycelial growth at a minimum inhibitory concentration of 1370 ppm. This concentration was effective in controlling the disease under greenhouse conditions. The effectivity of the capsules containing EO was superior to that of other controls using EO evaluated in vitro. The capsules demonstrated an effective period of 51 days, with an additional 30 days of effectiveness after a reinfection cycle, thus providing similar results to the control with <i>Trichoderma</i> sp.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Chitosan capsules present a promising strategy in the use of <i>C. citratus</i> EO on <i>C. gloeosporioides</i>, and they are highly effective and stable under in vitro and field conditions."

      "Herpes simplex viruses, HSV-1 and HSV-2, are highly contagious and cause lifelong, latent infections with recurrent outbreaks of oral and/or genital lesions. No cure exists for HSV-1 or HSV-2 infections, but antiviral medications are commonly used to prevent and treat outbreaks. Resistance to antivirals has begun to emerge, placing an importance on finding new and effective therapies for prophylaxis and treatment of HSV outbreaks. Botanicals may be effective HSV therapies as the constituents they contain act through a variety of mechanisms, potentially making the development of antiviral resistance more challenging. A wide variety of plants from different regions in the world have been studied for antiviral activity against HSV-1 and/or HSV-2 and showed efficacy of varying degrees. The purpose of this review is to summarize research conducted on whole plant extracts against HSV-1 and/or HSV-2 in vitro and in vivo. The majority of the research reviewed was conducted in vitro using animal cell lines, and some studies used an animal model design. Also summarized are a limited number of human trials conducted using botanical therapies on HSV lesions."
