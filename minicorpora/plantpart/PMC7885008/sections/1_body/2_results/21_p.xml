<p>In a study, the anticancer effects of 
 <italic>A. persicus</italic>, in human breast cancer T47D cells, were investigated. Also, expression ofp53 and Bcl-2 that are believed to play a critical role in tumorigenesis and cell death, were determined.Results of this study shows that Bcl-2 expression issignificantly increased in the presence of aerial but significantly decreased in the presence of root extractand p53 gene expression significantly increased in the presence of both plant extracts. In addition, treatment of T47D cells with 
 <italic>A. persicus</italic> extracts decreased the nuclear staining of p53 and cytoplasmic staining of Bcl-2 proteins. These results suggest that methanolic fractions especially those from the root, may contain active compounds, probably coumarins that prevent proliferation of T47D breast carcinoma cells by mechanisms such as apoptosis (

 <italic>A. persicus</italic> in human breast cancer T47D cells in comparison to tamoxifen, were evaluated (
