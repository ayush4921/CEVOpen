0:  In addition to chemical anticancer compounds, several anticancer compounds that act via various mechanisms of action, have been extracted from plant sources, valuable economic plants such as  Taxusbrevifolia, Curcuma longa, Catharanthus roseus, Cephalotaxus species,  Betula alba, Erythroxylumprevillei, and many others ( Gupta et al., 2017).
1: More than 60% of common anticancer compounds were prepared form the nature ( Cragg et al., 2005).
2: In 1950, a group of alkaloids derived from vinca and cytotoxic podophyllotoxins were discovered as the first anticancer compounds from plants ( Balunas et al., 2005).
3: Many natural compounds with anticancer effects (taxol, vinblastine, vincristine, etc.)
4: were structurally modified to yield more powerful anti-cancer analogues with fewer adverse effects ( Srivastava et al., 2005).
5: The National Cancer Institute (NCI) collected about 35,000 plant samples from 20 countries and screened around 114,000 extracts for anticancer activity ( Cragg et al., 2005).
