<p>Interestingly, Kouar et al. [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] have determined the phytochemical profile of alcoholic extract of 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> leaves, using the electrocoagulation and solvent extraction assays, and detected the presence of saponins, sterols, triterpene, tannins, and flavone aglycones. The quantitative analysis showed that 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> alcoholic extract contains high levels of total polyphenols (70.2 ± 0.4 mg of gallic acid equivalents/g extract) and total flavonoids (52.7 ± 0.01 mg of quercetin equivalents/g extract). The high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis allowed to identify six compounds in this alcoholic extract, including four phenolic acids (
 <bold>12–14, 16)</bold> and two flavonoid compounds (
 <bold>1–2</bold>) [
