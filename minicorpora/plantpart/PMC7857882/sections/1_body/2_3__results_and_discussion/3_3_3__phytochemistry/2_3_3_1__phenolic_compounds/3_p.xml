<p>Khouya et al. [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] have examined the phenolic composition of the 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> aqueous extracts and reported that they contain high levels of phenolic compounds, which are represented by rosmarinic acid as major phenolic acid and luteolin-7-glycoside and hesperetin as major flavonoids. Another study showed that 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> aqueous extracts were rich in total polyphenols (456.73 ± 6.94 mg caffeic acid equivalent/g of dry plant) and in flavonoid group (172.79 ± 2.12 mg rutin equivalent/g of dry plant) with rosmarinic acid, hesperetin, and luteolin-7-glucoside as major phenolic compounds [
