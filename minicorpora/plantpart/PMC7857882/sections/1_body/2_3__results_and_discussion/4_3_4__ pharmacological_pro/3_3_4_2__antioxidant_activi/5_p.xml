<p>The antioxidant activities of 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> extracts obtained from the aerial part were also examined by Labiad et al. [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] who reported remarkable antioxidant activities for hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and hydro-ethanolic extracts, using ABTS radical scavenging, DPPH, and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) methods, with ascorbic acid as positive control. The hydro-ethanolic extracts exhibited the highest antiradical effect against DPPH and ABTS radicals with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 3.86 ± 0.07 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL and 51.27 ± 0.82 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, respectively, followed by dichloromethane (IC
 <sub>50DPPH</sub> = 23.75 ± 0.67 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, IC
 <sub>50ABTS</sub> = 80.09 ± 0.65 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL), ethyl acetate (IC
 <sub>50DPPH</sub> = 23.75 ± 0.67 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, IC
 <sub>50ABTS</sub> = 85.16 ± 3.22 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL), and then hexane extracts (IC
 <sub>50DPPH</sub> = 275.71 ± 11.26 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, IC
 <sub>50ABTS</sub> = 127.38 ± 3.83 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL). Moreover, the hydro-ethanolic extract also exerted a great FRAP activity (233.292 ± 0.377 mg equivalent Ascorbic acid/g of extract). However, the hexane extract showed the lowest FRAP capacity (97.819 ± 0.377 mg equivalent ascorbic acid/g of extract) [
