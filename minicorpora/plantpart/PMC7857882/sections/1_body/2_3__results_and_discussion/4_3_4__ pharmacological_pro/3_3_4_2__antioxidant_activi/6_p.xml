<p>In a recent study, Hmidani et al. [
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] measured the capacity of aqueous extract of 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> to scavenge the generated radical ABTS+•, using ABTS assay, and showed significant scavenging activity of this extract (IC
 <sub>50ABTS</sub> = 14.65 ± 0.36 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) compared to ascorbic acid as standard (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.96 ± 0.1 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml). These findings support those obtained by Khouya et al. [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], which showed a considerable antioxidant activity of the 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> aerial part aqueous extract. Indeed, the tested aqueous extracts displayed potent scavenging activity against DPPH radical with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value equal to 0.44 ± 0.01 mg/mL TAE and a higher reducing power of ferric complex (40.14 ± 4.55 mmol Trolox/gTAE) than the Trolox used as positive control (44.33 ± 7.55 mmol Trolox/gTAE). Moreover, the aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> exerted a potent protective potential against hemolysis of erythrocytes according to APPH test results [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These considerable antioxidant effects of the aqueous extracts were attributed to their high phenolic content [
