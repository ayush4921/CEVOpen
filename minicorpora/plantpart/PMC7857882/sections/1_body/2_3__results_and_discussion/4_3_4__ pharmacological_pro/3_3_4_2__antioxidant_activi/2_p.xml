<p>Sbayou et al. [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] reported an important antioxidant activity of the EOs of 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> aerial parts using different methods, namely, DPPH free radical scavenging, TBARS, and 
 <italic>β</italic>-carotene/linoleic acid assays. In fact, the tested EOs exhibit a strong reduction of DPPH radical (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.25 ± 0.03 mg/mL) compared with ascorbic acid (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.25 ± 0.03 mg/mL) as standard antioxidant. However, the 
 <italic>β</italic>-carotene/linoleic acid assay showed a moderate antioxidant capacity (I% = 81.78 ± 0.37%) compared to BHT (I% = 98.13 ± 0.94%) as positive control. Taoufik et al. [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] also investigated the antiradical capacity of the 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> aerial part EOs using the DPPH scavenging test and reported an interesting antioxidant effect in a concentration-dependent manner. The IC
 <sub>50DPPH</sub> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.81 mg/mL) value was slightly lower than the antioxidant standards BHT (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.11 mg/mL) and Covi-oxT (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.11 mg/mL).
