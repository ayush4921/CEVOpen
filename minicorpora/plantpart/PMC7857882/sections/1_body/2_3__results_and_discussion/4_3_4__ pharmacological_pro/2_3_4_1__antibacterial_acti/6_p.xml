<p>More interestingly, Amrouche et al. [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] investigated both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and in a food system the antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> EOs, extracted from the whole plant, against foodborne bacteria (
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic>). The paper disc diffusion and broth microdilution methods were used for the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> test and the beef minced meat was used as food model. Thereby, the addition of 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> EOs to inoculated beef minced meat decreased the tested strain population after 4 days of storage. Moreover, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> investigations indicated that 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> was the most sensitive bacteria (Ф = 19 mm and MIC = 1.1%), followed by 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (Ф = 16 mm, MIC = 1.1%) and then 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (Ф = 14.25 mm, MIC = 1.25%) [
