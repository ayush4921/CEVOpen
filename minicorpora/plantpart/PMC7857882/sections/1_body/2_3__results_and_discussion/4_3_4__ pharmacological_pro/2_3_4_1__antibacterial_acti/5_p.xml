<p>Mekkaoui et al. [
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] tested 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> the antimicrobial effect of EOs of 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> harvested at two different phenological stages (flowering and postflowering) against three pathogenic bacteria responsible for foodborne disease in Morocco (
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>B. subtilis,</italic> and 
 <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic>). They showed that EOs obtained after the flowering stage were more active against the studied strains than those obtained in the flowering stage. In fact, the highest activity was shown against 
 <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> followed by 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, while the weakest activity was noticed against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> [
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. In the same context, Oussalah et al. [
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] evaluated the antibacterial potential of the 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> flower EOs against four pathogenic bacteria including two Gram-positive bacteria: 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> (2812 1/2a), and two Gram-negative bacteria: 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7 and 
 <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> (SL 1344), using the broth microdilution method. The results indicated that 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> was the most sensitive bacterium with MIC = 0.05% (v/v) followed by 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7 and 
 <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> (MIC = 0.2% (v/v)), while 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> was the least sensitive bacteria to the tested EOs with MIC = 0.4% (v/v).
