<p>In the same context, Rahmouni et al. [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] reported fungicide effect of 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> EOs and their major components (thymol, 
 <italic>α</italic>-terpineol, carvacrol, and borneol) against a phytopathogenic fungus responsible for fusarium wilt on date palm in Morocco, named 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. Albedinis</italic>. The results of this study showed that these EOs as well as their major compounds inhibited noticeably the mycelia growth of 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. Albedinis</italic> in a concentration-dependent manner. The maximal fungicidal effect of the studied compounds was noticed by thymol with a minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) value of 03.08 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/mL, followed by 
 <italic>α</italic>-terpineol (MFC = 12.20 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/mL), carvacrol (MFC = 16.96 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/mL), and borneol (MFC = 22.73 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/mL) [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Furthermore, 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> EO was found to inhibit spore germination of phytopathogenic fungi of citrus, namely, 
 <italic>Penicillium digitatum</italic>, 
 <italic>P. italicum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Galactomyces citriaurantii</italic> at concentrations greater than 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/mL [
