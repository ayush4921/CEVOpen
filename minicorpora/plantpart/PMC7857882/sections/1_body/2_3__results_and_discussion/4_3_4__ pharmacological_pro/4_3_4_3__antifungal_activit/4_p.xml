<p>In addition, El Bouzidi et al. [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] assessed the anticandidal activity of 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> EOs obtained from aerial parts against four candida species, including 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, 
 <italic>C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. krusei</italic> using disc diffusion and microdilution assays, and fluconazol (40 
 <italic>μ</italic>l) as reference. The findings of this study showed that all tested strains were more sensitive to the tested EOs (37.67 ± 1.53 mm &lt; Ф &lt; 42.00 ± 1.00 mm) than to the synthetic fungicide (fluconazol) used as a positive control (26.50 ± 0.50 mm &lt; Ф &lt; 29.83 ± 1.15 mm).
