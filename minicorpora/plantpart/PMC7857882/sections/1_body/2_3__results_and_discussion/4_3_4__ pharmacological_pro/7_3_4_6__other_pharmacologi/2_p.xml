<p>Jaafari et al. [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] evaluated the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antitumor activity of 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> EOs collected in different regions (High Atlas of Morocco, Bin Elwidane-Beni Mellal, and Tiznit) on P815 mastocytoma cell line using the 3-(4,5-di-methylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The results showed that all tested EOs exhibit an important cytotoxic effect against P815 cell line with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values from 0.225% (v/v) to 0.24% (v/v). The antiproliferative effect of 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> crude extracts was studied against MCF-7 breast cancer cell line using MTT assay and showed their strong inhibition with a half-inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) value of 37.5 ± 4.02
