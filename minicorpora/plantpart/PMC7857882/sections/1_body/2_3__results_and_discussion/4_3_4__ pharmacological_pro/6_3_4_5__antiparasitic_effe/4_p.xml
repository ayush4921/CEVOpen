<p>The acaricidal activity of 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> EOs was also reported in the literature. Ramzi et al. [
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] studied the effect of the EOs of 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> aerial parts against adults of 
 <italic>Varroa destructor</italic> (Acari: Varroidae) and indicated an interesting mortality rate of 50% after 24 h and 80% after 48 h. Additionally, 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> EO was shown to destroy completely the wheat pest 
 <italic>Sitophilus oryzae</italic> (coleopters) at a concentration of 2.4 × 10
 <sup>−2</sup>
