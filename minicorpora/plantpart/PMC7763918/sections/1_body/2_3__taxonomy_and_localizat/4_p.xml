<p>Three types of glandular trichomes are characterized based upon their surface morphology, namely bulbous, sessile, and stalked (

 <xref rid="B38-molecules-25-05792" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Bulbous trichomes are the smallest, while sessile trichomes appear on the epidermis with a short stalk and globose head comprised of a multicellular disc of secretory cells and a subcuticular metabolite storage cavity. Similarly, the stalked trichomes are slightly larger with a globose head elevated above the epidermal surface by a multicellular stalk [
