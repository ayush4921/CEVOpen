<p>Preliminary phytochemical screening tests are important for the identification of bioactive principles and may subsequently guide drug discovery and improvement. In the present study, several phytochemical constituents of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> were identified. Primary phytochemical screening of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> leaves confirmed the presence of steroids, flavonoids, tannins, glycerol, and saponins, while alkaloids were present only in the methanol and ethanol extracts. The results of the phytochemical analyses are presented in 
 <xref rid="table1-0300060520962344" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Such phytochemicals may provide new avenues for the development of new classes of pharmaceutical, biopesticidal, insecticidal, and antimicrobial agents.

 </sup> Previously, various organic extracts of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> leaves were reported to contain steroids, flavonoids, tannins, and fixed oil.

 </sup> These phytochemical compounds are the top candidates conferring medicinal value to this plant. Indeed, the most abundant compounds found in all solvent extracts in the present study, including several flavonoids, glycosides, terpenoids, and alkaloids isolated from this plant, have been reported to exert diverse biological activities.
