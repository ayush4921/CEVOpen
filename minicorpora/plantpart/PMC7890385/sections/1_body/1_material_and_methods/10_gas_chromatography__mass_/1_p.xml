<p id="Par15">To check the chemical composition of the tested EOs, we employed GC-MS approach using GC-MS–TQ8030 apparatus, equipped with RTX 5MS column at an ionizing voltage of 70 eV. The mass spectra obtained were compared with the relevant compounds in NIST11 library of GC-MS data system as well as already reported literature. The GC-MS of Lemongrass EO analysis was carried out by the method of Mirghani and coworkers [

Injector temperature was maintained at 220 °C, and the MS transfer line temperature was set at 290 °C. Helium was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL/min and a split ratio of 1:30. However, for GC-MS analysis of TTEO, slight modifications were made by changing the column temperature from 60 to 240 °C with an increase of 3 °C/min, maintained for 35 min.
