<p id="Par8">The adulticidal assay on 
 <italic>M. domestica</italic> was carried out according to the method described previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] with minor changes. The bioassays were designed such that the flies would have a maximum probability of exposure to the tested concentration of EOs. The adult houseflies (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10) were transferred to a plastic jar of 1.2 dm
 <sup>3</sup> having a cotton yarn attached internally to the cap (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). The cotton yarn was sprayed with different concentrations of EO in the range of 10–100 mg/dm
 <sup>3</sup> which was dissolved in 10 µL acetone. To avoid direct contact of flies with EO, the cotton yarn was covered with a thin muslin cloth. In case of control set, the cotton yarn enclosed in muslin cloth contained only 10 µL of acetone. The experiments were replicated 10 times at 28 ± 2 °C for 30 min to calculate the mortality rate caused by EO treatment.
