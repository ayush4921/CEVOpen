<p id="Par19">Since both the EOs exhibited adulticidal activities but the activity depicted by TT compound was significant with LC
 <sub>50</sub> and LC
 <sub>90</sub> concentrations of 14.88 mg/dm
 <sup>3</sup> and 46.27 mg/dm
 <sup>3</sup>, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). However, LGEO showed LC
 <sub>50</sub> at 19.17 mg/dm
 <sup>3</sup> and LC
 <sub>90</sub> with 72.05 mg/dm
 <sup>3</sup>, showing 100% mortality at concentration 100 mg/dm
 <sup>3</sup> which was higher than TTEO (80 mg/dm
 <sup>3</sup>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). The Chi square values and 95% confidence limits indicated that the results obtained were statistically significant at 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001. A similar trend like larvicidal activity was observed in case of adulticidal activity; with increased dose the percent (%) mortality also increased showing positive correlation with the bioefficacy of the tested compounds. Similar inferences have been reported by Shalaby and coworkers [
