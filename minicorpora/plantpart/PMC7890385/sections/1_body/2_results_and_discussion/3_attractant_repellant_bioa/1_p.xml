<p id="Par20">In this assay, TTEO showed 77.04% repellency which was slightly higher than the repellency potential of LG, (i.e., 67.34% repellency) at a concentration of 0.1% (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Recently, the repellent activity of 
 <italic>Cymbopogon citratus</italic> (lemongrass) EO against mosquitoes has been examined by Oyedele et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Jayasinghe and Fujimoto, [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] stated that repellent potential to 
 <italic>C. citrates</italic> is majorly imparted by its dominant compound geraniol while testing them against 
 <italic>Sitotroga cerealella</italic> and 
 <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>. However, Kumar et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] have revealed that some monoterpene aldehydes such as Linalool, linalyl acetate, Citral a and Citral b are the main factors responsible for repellent activity of 
 <italic>C. citratus.</italic>
