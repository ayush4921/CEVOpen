<p id="Par22">Further, it was observed that LGEO is more effective on pupae as compared to TTEO causing adult deformation, shrinkage of wings and even producing pupal-adult intermediates (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). However, such effects were also observed by Dimetry et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] while examination of volatile oil from 
 <italic>P. nigra</italic> on 3rd instar larvae of 
 <italic>M. domestica</italic>. Some authors have observed that treatment of 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> and 
 <italic>Z. officinale</italic> EOs on 
 <italic>C. albiceps</italic> produces larval-pupal or pupal-adult intermediates with crumpled wings. The effect of EO from LG and TT are more promising than 
 <italic>C. aurantifolia</italic> peels or 
 <italic>Citrus sinensis</italic> which show only 70% fumigant effectiveness against houseflies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The difference in efficacy between contact toxicity and fumigation assays may be due to the different percentage contributions of chemical components in two phases of oils. Further in the fumigation assay it was observed that % inhibition of house flies is dose dependent because the increased dose of EOs causes increase in % IR of pupae and increased chances of deformities in adult flies.
