<p id="Par21">The literature related to deformity of insects by EO is scanty, and the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. The pupicidal assay carried out by two different methods proved that contact toxicity also known as topical method is more effective than fumigation approach for housefly control with LG and TTEOs. In fumigation assay, the lethal dose evaluated by probit analysis showed significant activity with LGEO which exhibited LD
 <sub>50</sub> and LD
 <sub>90</sub> values at 14.49 µL/0.25L and 37.45 µL/0.25L, respectively. The TTEO showed LD
 <sub>50</sub> and LD
 <sub>90</sub> concentrations as 29.68 µL/0.25L and 59.51 µL/0.25L. In fumigation assay LGEO was found to be more toxic against pupae than TTEO (Fig.

In case of contact toxicity method none of the flies emerged into normal adults ensuring either 100% mortality of the pupae or deformities after emergence due to EO treatment. The LGEO showed complete (100%) inhibition of pupae at a concentration of 100 µL/0.25L of air displaying more toxic nature, whereas the concentration of TTEO required for 100% inhibition was found to be 80 µL/0.25L of air displaying more toxic nature. With increased doses in fumigation assay the inhibition rate (IR) also increased in both the oils showing maximum deformities in adults. The higher proficiency (100% inhibition) in the contact toxicity method for pupicidal effect could be attributed to the collapse of the insect neural system, therefore causing instant and complete knockdown of the flies which was also reported by Kumar et al.
