<p id="Par18">Among the EOs tested against the larvae of 
 <italic>M. domestica</italic>, it was observed that TTEO proved to be more effective as compared to LGEO as depicted by the lower concentration required for 50% mortality of the larvae (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The TTEO showed higher larvicidal activity at LC
 <sub>50</sub> 4.94 mg/mL (actual dose was 0.0776 µg/cm
 <sup>2</sup>) which was very low and statistically significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 level) than LG essential oil requiring 5.33 mg/mL (actual dose was 0.0838 µg/cm
 <sup>2</sup>) to kill 50% of pest populations. Though it is not surprising to observe the increased mortality rate with increased concentrations of EO but the time required by TTEO to achieve LC
 <sub>50</sub> which was only 24 h is quite fascinating (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). It can further elucidate that short-term exposure of larvae to lethal doses can markedly increase their mortality over time, and thus reduce the population levels below threshold. Our observations were in line with Shalaby and coworkers who reported that lemon oil shows higher larvicidal activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Similarly Bosly, [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] stated that EOs from 
 <italic>Mentha piperita</italic> and 
 <italic>Lavandula angustifolia</italic> caused mortality and prolonged larval stages in 
 <italic>M. domestica</italic> thereby show a potential insecticidal effect.
