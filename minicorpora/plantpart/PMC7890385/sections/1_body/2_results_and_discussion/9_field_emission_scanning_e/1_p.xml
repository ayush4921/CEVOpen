<p id="Par28">To have a clear visualization of the morphological alterations induced by EO treatment to the house fly larvae, the FESEM analysis evaluated the ultra-structural changes in the larval integument. The marked changes caused by EO treatment are shrinkage of body segments, along with withered anterior segments (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). However, in case of control set where larvae were treated with acetone only, the body appearance was clear and smooth without any distorted structure. Like LG, the TTEO was also found to cause shrinkage and distortion of the larval body. Recently, Kumar et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] also reported similar effects on surface morphology of 
 <italic>M. domestica</italic> larvae due to treatment of 
 <italic>E. globules</italic> EO. They further elucidated that 
 <italic>E. globulus</italic> oil causes surface shrinkage at spinose rings with protruding intersegmental grooves. The surface aberration on insect larva could be caused due to absorption of plant extracts to the larval gut or by ingestion through the cuticle and gut epithelial cells. Similarly, Kumar et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] also observed an effect on proliferation of spinose cells after treatment with EO. According to Pérez-Serrano et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] loss of integument organization is a result of stress responses to EO toxicity.
