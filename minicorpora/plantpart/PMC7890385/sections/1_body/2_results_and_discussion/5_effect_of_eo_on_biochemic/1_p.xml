<p id="Par23">Since the nutritional reserves like lipids, sugars and proteins are vital for proper growth and development of the insect we explored the impact of EOs on these metabolites in 
 <italic>M. domestica</italic>. The LC
 <sub>50</sub> concentrations of EOs showed a notable influence on total body sugar, glycogen, lipid and protein content of third instar larvae. Comparably the LGEO exhibited high influence (reduction) over the total sugar, glycogen, and protein contents, whereas TTEO showed a significant effect on total lipid content in 
 <italic>M. domestica</italic> larvae. The LGEO drastically reduced the total sugar, glycogen and protein contents by 3.29, 2.95 and 7.56 fold, respectively, while TTEO reduced the lipid content of larvae by 1.62 fold after treatment at LC
 <sub>50</sub> concentration for 24 h (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Our inferences were consistent with the observations of Senthilkumar and his colleagues, [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] who reported a decrease in the concentration of proteins, lipids and carbohydrates by EOs. However, the reduction of glycogen and sugar content after treatment could be due to their involvement to combat the chemical stress imposed by the tested compounds. Hence, treatment with EOs might have possibly interrupted the metabolic processes and resulted in larval mortality [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The reduction of protein content by exposure to plant extracts is frequently reported in the literature. According to Shakoori and Saleem, [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] reduced level of proteins after treatment with EOs may be due to the breakdown of proteins into their amino acids, which help the insect for survival. Similarly, the reduced amount of sugar content in treated larvae of 
 <italic>M. domestica</italic> could have occurred due to over exploitation of carbohydrate resources under stress conditions for proper maintenance of physiological metabolism. However, Khosravi et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] stated that in 
 <italic>G. pyloalis</italic>, sugar content is used to meet energy expenses for detoxification of 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> extract which ultimately leads to exploitation of lipid contents of the body. Our results were in close agreement with the conclusions of Canavoso et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] who detected reduction of lipids in the larvae of 
 <italic>S. littoralis</italic> after treatment with lemon and garlic essential oils. The overall reduction in biochemical contents of the larvae due to EO treatment results in poor metabolism consequently leading to deformities or making the individuals prone to opportunistic diseases by pathogens as compared to normal larvae. Therefore, from the inferences of this test it can be concluded that tested EOs possess remarkable bioefficacy against nuisance causing pest i.e., house fly.
