In view of this objective, the present study demonstrates the efficacy of lemongrass (LG) and tea tree essential oils (TTEOs) against <italic>M. domestica</italic>. The TTEO proved to be more lethal against larvae and adults of <italic>M. domestica</italic> depicting an LC<sub>50</sub> at 14.88&#x000a0;mg/ dm<sup>3</sup> which was 17.19&#x000a0;mg/ dm<sup>3</sup> for LGEO. In contrast, pupicidal effect of LGEO was much higher (LD<sub>50</sub>, 14.49&#x000a0;&#x000b5;l/0.25L) as compared to TTEO. The LGEO drastically reduced the total body sugar, glycogen and protein contents by 3.29, 2.95 and 7.56 fold, respectively, contrasting with high influence of TTEO on lipid content of the late 3rd instar larvae. A considerable reduction in gut enzymes secretion was observed due to treatment of EOs thereby altering gut physiology of the insect. Moreover, significant inhibition of acetylcholine esterase (AchE) was also observed with LGEO at LC<sub>50</sub> concentration (5.33&#x000a0;mg/ml) inhibiting insect neurotransmission. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) analysis of the LGEO showed 12 major compounds dominated by Citral whereas TTEO contained only 5 major compounds. Further analysis by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) revealed distortion and shrinkage of larval bodies caused by the treatment of EOs. These overall observations brand LG and TT-EOs as potential organic-insecticides against <italic>M. domestica</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Graphic Abstract</title><p id="Par2">

It has become a worldwide problem for transmission of pathogens such as protozoan cysts, helminth parasites, enteropathogenic bacteria, Turkey coronavirus, enterovirus as well as avian flu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It causes heavy damage to livestock, poultry and humans. It has been very instrumental for the epidemics of dysentery, diphtheria, typhoid, leprosy in humans, whereas fowl cholera and anthrax diseases of poultry and livestock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The frequent movement of flies between animals and rotten food makes them ideal porters for disease causing pathogens. Therefore, the population control of this pest below threshold levels becomes immensely important from the public health viewpoint and has attracted attention of the scientific community worldwide. During the last century chemical control was the only potential option for managing this insect, but in the present era of advanced technologies many prospective alternatives, such as cultural tactics and biological agents, are routinely used for controlling this pest. Moreover, house flies are reported to show resistance to chemical agents such as organochlorines, organophosphates, pyrethroids, etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Furthermore, synthetic pesticides are also well-known to harm non-target organisms, cause bioaccumulation in trophic levels, ecological imbalances and environmental pollution. Thus, there is a dire need to prospect for new, promising and sustainable biological agents that could be potential tools for managing the housefly populations below threshold levels. Prospectively, there are renewed efforts to develop plant-based formulations which could be considered as highly effective, eco-friendly, cheap, biodegradable and safe for humankind as well as the&#x000a0;environment. According to Isman, favorable eco-toxicological properties of botanical pesticides make them potentially suitable for use in integrated pest management (IPM) programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Consequently, essential oils (EO) extracted from plants are reviewed as potential plant-based organic-agents due to their inherent valuable properties.</p><p id="Par4">Since EOs are mixtures of organic compounds that can accomplish multiple functions such as protein denaturation, enzymatic inhibition and membrane disintegration in animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Some compounds may act as insect growth regulators (IGR) affecting the neuromuscular system of pests and mimic the symptoms of organophosphates. While others absorb through the cuticle and function as fumigants causing respiratory damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Since every pesticide has its pros and cons but the specialty of plant-based formulations being species-specific and biodegradable makes them an ideal choice for future pest management practices. The EOs from LG and TT are known to be stress relievers bearing many medicinal properties for humans. However, their valorization for pest management in general and house flies in particular has remained to be explored. Thus, in the present study, we investigated the effects of LG and TTEOs against the menacing house fly, <italic>M. domestica</italic>. The efficacy of EOs were tested on different life stages of the model insect by using various biochemical techniques while the morphological alterations imposed by EO treatment were also determined using FESEM. Moreover, attempts were made to explore the composition of EOs under consideration in order to confirm the active ingredients responsible for insecticidal properties.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Chemicals and Reagents</title><p id="Par5">The EOs of lemongrass (<italic>Cymbopogon citratus</italic>) and tea tree (<italic>Melaleuca alternifolia</italic>) used in the study were procured from Sigma Aldrich, (Millipore Sigma, USA).

The pupicidal assay carried out by two different methods proved that contact toxicity also known as topical method is more effective than fumigation approach for housefly control with LG and TTEOs. In fumigation assay, the lethal dose evaluated by probit analysis showed significant activity with LGEO which exhibited LD<sub>50</sub> and LD<sub>90</sub> values at 14.49 &#x000b5;L/0.25L and 37.45 &#x000b5;L/0.25L, respectively.

In fumigation assay LGEO was found to be more toxic against pupae than TTEO (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In case of contact toxicity method none of the flies emerged into normal adults ensuring either 100% mortality of the pupae or deformities after emergence due to EO treatment. The LGEO showed complete (100%) inhibition of pupae at a concentration of 100 &#x000b5;L/0.25L of air displaying more toxic nature, whereas the concentration of TTEO required for 100% inhibition was found to be 80 &#x000b5;L/0.25L of air displaying more toxic nature. With increased doses in fumigation assay the inhibition rate (IR) also increased in both the oils showing maximum deformities in adults. The higher proficiency (100% inhibition) in the contact toxicity method for pupicidal effect could be attributed to the collapse of the insect neural system, therefore causing instant and complete knockdown of the flies which was also reported by Kumar et al.

The difference in efficacy between contact toxicity and fumigation assays may be due to the different percentage contributions of chemical components in two phases of oils.

Comparably the LGEO exhibited high influence (reduction) over the total sugar, glycogen, and protein contents, whereas TTEO showed a significant effect on total lipid content in <italic>M. domestica</italic> larvae. The LGEO drastically reduced the total sugar, glycogen and protein contents by 3.29, 2.95 and 7.56 fold, respectively, while TTEO reduced the lipid content of larvae by 1.62 fold after treatment at LC<sub>50</sub> concentration for 24&#x000a0;h (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Our inferences were consistent with the observations of Senthilkumar and his colleagues, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] who reported a decrease in the concentration of proteins, lipids and carbohydrates by EOs. However, the reduction of glycogen and sugar content after treatment could be due to their involvement to combat the chemical stress imposed by the tested compounds. Hence, treatment with EOs might have possibly interrupted the metabolic processes and resulted in larval mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The reduction of protein content by exposure to plant extracts is frequently reported in the literature. According to Shakoori and Saleem, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] reduced level of proteins after treatment with EOs may be due to the breakdown of proteins into their amino acids, which help the insect for survival. Similarly, the reduced amount of sugar content in treated larvae of <italic>M. domestica</italic> could have occurred due to over exploitation of carbohydrate resources under stress conditions for proper maintenance of physiological metabolism. However, Khosravi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] stated that in <italic>G. pyloalis</italic>, sugar content is used to meet energy expenses for detoxification of <italic>A. annua</italic> extract which ultimately leads to exploitation of lipid contents of the body.

The overall reduction in biochemical contents of the larvae due to EO treatment results in poor metabolism consequently leading to deformities or making the individuals prone to opportunistic diseases by pathogens as compared to normal larvae.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] loss of integument organization is a result of stress responses to EO toxicity.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;7</label><caption><p>The ultra-structural view of the alterations cause by essential oil treatment to&#x000a0;the surface of housefly larvae for 24&#x000a0;h.

Taking into consideration, we determined the effect of LG and TTEOs on different forms of <italic>M. domestica</italic>. As evident from the observations, LG and TT oils showed potential bioefficacy against different life stages of the housefly. Since LG and TTEOs significantly reduced the metabolic contents and inhibited the enzymes like AChE, &#x003b1;-amylase, etc. the present study signposts the insecticidal repertoire of tested compounds for the sustainable management of houseflies. The inhibition of pupal emergence into adults together with larvicidal and adulticidal effects also suggest the formulation of these botanicals for potential industrial applications. The tested oils can thus be easily formulated as microemulsions or nanoemulsions in water or eco-friendly solvent systems. The microemulsions are known to enhance bioefficacy and provide long-term stability to the botanicals. Being volatile, the EOs can also be dissolved in solvents and kept at desired places inside buildings whereby they function as strong repellents for houseflies. In conclusion, LG and TTEOs could prove as important candidates for pest control strategy against houseflies due to their intrinsic larvicidal, pupicidal and adulticidal properties while LG may also act as an effective repellent and ovipositional deterrent for closely related species. However, for field trials and formulation of tested EOs a comprehensive understanding of their mechanism of action on model insect becomes imperative to avert the effects on non-target fauna. Therefore, our future perspective will be to characterize the transcriptome of <italic>M. domestica</italic> in response to EO treatment to better understand the mechanisms associated with their insecticidal activities.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par30">To determine the insecticidal potential of EOs from LG and TT against <italic>M. domestica</italic> different experiments were carried out on different stages of the model insect. In most of the experiments, tested compounds showed significant effects for the control of <italic>M. domestica.</italic> In adulticidal and repellency assays, TTEO proved more effective than LGEO. In contrast, LGEO showed more potential as fumigant for (14.49 &#x000b5;L/0.25 L of air) pupae of house fly. The present study concludes the significant efficacy of EOs under consideration against <italic>M. domestica</italic> which could be employed to breakdown its population below threshold levels to prevent the menace of some vector-borne diseases. The treatment of TTEO significantly decreased sugar, glycogen and lipid contents whereas LGEO highly affects the total protein content of <italic>M. domestica.</italic> A considerable reduction of &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;- glucosidase activities was found in treated larvae as compared to the control. The above all findings of the present study brands TT and LGEOs as potential agents for eco-friendly management of houseflies under IPM program encouraging field trials.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><sec id="Sec26"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="40011_2020_1220_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><caption><p>Supplementary material 1 (DOCX 211&#x000a0;kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Significance statement</bold> The housefly<italic>, Musca domestica</italic> is a menace for the modern civilization due to its role in transmission of fatal diseases.
