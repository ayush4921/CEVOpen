<p>The review of Speranza et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-10-00035" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] provides a general botanical and ethnobotanical overview summarizing up-to-date knowledge on the phytochemistry and biological properties of 
 <italic>Isatis tinctoria</italic> L. (Brassicaceae), a medicinal plant commonly known as woad, and also historically used as an indigo dye. Currently, 
 <italic>I. tinctoria</italic> is commonly used as a medicinal remedy and as a cosmetic ingredient. In 2011, a monograph of 
 <italic>I. tinctoria</italic> was officially included in the European Pharmacopoeia. 
 <italic>Isatidis radix</italic> is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Most recently, the National Health of Commission of P.R. China proposed 
 <italic>Isatidis radix</italic> granula as a treatment against COVID-19. Many studies have shown anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, antimicrobial, antiviral, analgesic, and antioxidant activities. The phytochemical composition of 
 <italic>I. tinctoria</italic> has been thoroughly updated in the review, including information on the attempts in plant biotechnology studies at the enhanced production of flavonoids and alkaloids from 
 <italic>I. tinctoria</italic> hairy root and shoot cultures as an alternative to plant raw materials.
