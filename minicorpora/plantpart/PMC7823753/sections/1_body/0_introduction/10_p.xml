<p>Singh et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-plants-10-00035" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] have performed a multivariate analysis of amino acids and health-benefiting properties of cantaloupe varieties grown in six locations in the United States as a dietary source of protein and amino acids. The variation in amino acid amount is an indicator for quality control, and the selection of melon varieties for a commercial purpose from different locations. They were found to differ remarkably in function regarding their origin. The differences are also relevant for the phenolic content and in the antioxidant potential.
