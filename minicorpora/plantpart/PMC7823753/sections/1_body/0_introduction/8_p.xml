<p>Omidpanah et al. [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-10-00035" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] have analyzed the influences of monoterpenes of 
 <italic>Trachyspermum ammi</italic> on the viability of spermatogonia stem cells. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to evaluate the expressions of several genes (promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein, DNA-binding protein inhibitor, tyrosine protein kinase, B-cell lymphoma 2, and Bcl2-associated X protein) after treatment with oil obtained by hydrodistillation. The results reveal a correlation with the amount of oil used, in particular with thymol, suggesting its role in the improved quality and viability of spermatogonia cells in cell culture and the activation/blocking of specific signals inside the cells.
