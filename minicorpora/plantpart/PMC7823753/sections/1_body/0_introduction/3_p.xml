<p>Never, in this hard year, has the necessity to develop alternative solutions and strategies to fight microorganisms and viruses been so timely. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is very common in humans and is associated with oral mucocutaneous lesions and/or genital infections. In the article entitled “In Vitro Anti-HSV-1 Activity of Polyphenol-Rich Extracts and Pure Polyphenol Compounds Derived from Pistachios Kernels (
 <italic>Pistacia vera</italic> L.)”, the authors [
 <xref rid="B7-plants-10-00035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] have reported on the activity of polyphenol-rich extracts of pistachio kernels on HSV-1 replication. The results obtained showed that pistachio polyphenols have remarkable inhibitory activity against HSV-1. Natural compounds could become great candidates for the development of novel topical or oral drug formulations to treat HSV-1 infections, either alone or in combination with standard antiviral therapies.
