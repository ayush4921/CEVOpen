<p>P‐cymene was identified in the floral budding and full flowering stage, however its maximum value (4.2%) was observed in the full flowering stage. γ‐terpinene was detected in the full flowering stage and the floral budding stage (6.3 and 4.4%, respectively). In a study on the Ajowan plant, the amount of γ‐terpinene in the early stages of growth was low, and arrived to its maximum at flowering stage, then subsequently decreased, which could be due to the adsorption of pollinators (Soltani Howyzeh et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31916-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). α‐curcumene was observed only in the early growth stages of 
 <italic>H. persicum</italic> and the maximum amount was related to the floral budding stage (7.6%). Caryophyllene and myristicin were the predominant compounds in the early growth period and full flowering which were quantified by the amount of 14.1 and 15.0%, respectively. β‐bisabolene was the predominant compound that detected in the floral budding stage and as the plant age increased, its value decreased.
