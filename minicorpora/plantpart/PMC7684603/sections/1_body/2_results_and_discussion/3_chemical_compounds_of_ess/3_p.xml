<p>The main constituents of the essential oil in various stages were limonene (18.1%), caryophyllene (14.1%), β‐bisabolene (8.9%), β‐pinene (8.7%), 1‐tetradecanol (7.1%), caryophyllene oxide (6.1%), spatulenol (5.8%), myristicin (5.2%), carene (4.2%), α‐curcumene (3.5%) at the vegetative stage. Anethole (14.6%), β‐bisabolene (12.6%), hexyl butyrate (8.2%), α‐curcumene (7.6%), myristicin (7.3%), 1‐tetradecanol (5.4%), α‐pinene (4.7%), γ‐terpinene (4.4%), caryophyllene (4.4%), and apiol (3.1%) were the main constituents of the essential oil in the early flowering stage. In the full flowering stage, values were as follows, myristicin (15.0%), hexyl butyrate (9.1%), β‐bisabolene (8.3%), anethole (8.1%), apiol (7.1%), γ‐terpinene (6.3%), α‐pinene (4.9%), p‐cymene (4.2%), octyl acetate (3.3%), and hexyl isovalerate (3.2%). During seed development, butyrate (32.1%), octyl acetate (11.7%), hexyl 2‐methyl butyrate (5.8%), cis‐5‐octen‐1‐ol (5.8%), 4‐methyl pentyl isobutyrate (4.9%), octyl isobutyrate (4.5%), and hexyl 4‐methoxybenzyl ester (3.6%) were dominant constituent of the essential oil. Lastly, in the phenological stage of immature seeds, hexyl butyrate (38.8%), octyl acetate (14.5%), cis‐5‐octen‐1‐ol (6.3%), hexyl 2‐methyl butyrate (4.2%), and 4‐methyl pentyl isobutyrate (3.6%) were measured as the predominant constituent of the essential oil; however, these percentages changed to 23.6, 10.5, 8.0, 4.8, and 8.2% at the seed final maturation stage, respectively (Table

 <xref rid="fsn31916-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The essential oil constituent was different in different phenological stages. In addition, predominant compounds of essential oil changed during different growth stages, which are also presented in the Table
