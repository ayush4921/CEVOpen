<p>The second and large group of the constituent compounds was the monoterpene hydrocarbons which their value in the early stage of the vegetative period was 34.2%, and with increasing the plant age and seed maturation, its value reduced, and finally this compound was not found in the mid‐mature seed stage (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31916-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Several compounds of approximately 40 compounds belongs to monoterpene hydrocarbons group have been discovered by various researchers in the 
 <italic>H. persicum</italic> (Amanpour et al.,

 <xref rid="fsn31916-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). In the present study, most of these compounds were observed in the flowering stage and prior to it, and when the plant entered into the seed set stage, the value of these compounds was significantly reduced (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31916-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The most important compounds in this group were limonene, β‐pinene, α‐pinene, and γ‐terpinene. Other studies also confirmed these compounds as predominant compounds in the 
 <italic>H. persicum</italic> (Mojab &amp; Nickavar,

 <xref rid="fsn31916-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). Similar to the present study, other researchers reported high amount of these compounds in flowers and leaves, in comparison to seeds (Mojab &amp; Nickavar,
