 <caption> Examination of the DEGs expression profiles at four different time points using qRT-PCR analysis. Ten candidate genes were selected for validation using oil palm seedling roots treated under Pi sufficient (control) and deficient (Pi-starved) conditions for 7d, 14d, 21d and 28d. The y-axis represents log 2 fold-change of the relative expression level normalized with all three normalization factors, NADH5, GRAS and β-actin and the x-axis represented the treatment duration. The data shown are the mean log 2 fold change of the relative expression level of three biological replicates with standard error. Asterisks indicate significant difference between control and Pi-starved treatments in the Student t-test ( p &lt; 0.05). NIP6–1: Aquaporin NIP6–1 like protein (105038152); SPX5: SPX domain-containing protein 5 (105058610); SPX-MFS: SPX-MFS domain-containing protein (105054157); SPX1: SPX domain-containing protein 1 (105047822); PHL7: PHL7-like protein (105050046); AP2/ERF: dehydration-responsive element-binding protein 1C (105059334); LPR1: multicopper oxidase LPR1-like protein (105041188); SCL15: Scarecrow-like protein 15 (105032345) </caption>
