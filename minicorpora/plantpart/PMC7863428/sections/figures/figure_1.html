 <caption> Physiological responses of oil palm seedlings to Pi-deprivation treatment. Total P concentration (mg g-1DW) of oil palm a roots and b young leaves under +P and -P conditions. The total P contents were assessed at 7d, 14d, 21d and 28d. Errors bars are standard deviation ( n = 3). Asterisk indicates statistically significant ( p &lt; 0.05) differences between samples grown under +P and -P conditions. c Morphological phenotypes of oil palm seedlings after 28 days growth in +P and -P media.
