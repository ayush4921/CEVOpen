  <p>Physiological responses of oil palm seedlings to Pi-deprivation treatment. Total P concentration (mg g-1DW) of oil palm 
   <bold>a</bold> roots and 
   <bold>b</bold> young leaves under +P and -P conditions. The total P contents were assessed at 7d, 14d, 21d and 28d. Errors bars are standard deviation (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3). Asterisk indicates statistically significant (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) differences between samples grown under +P and -P conditions. 
   <bold>c</bold> Morphological phenotypes of oil palm seedlings after 28 days growth in +P and -P media. Bar = 2 cm
