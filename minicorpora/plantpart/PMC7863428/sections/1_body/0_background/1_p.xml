<p id="Par31">P is the second most limiting macronutrient for crop productivity after nitrogen. It acts as an essential constituent of nucleic acids important for storage and transfer of genetic information and as a structural element for a number of molecular compounds including ATP, ADP, phospholipid and coenzymes involved in energy transfer and physiological processes in plant cells [
