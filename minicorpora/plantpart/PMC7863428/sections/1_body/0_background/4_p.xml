<p id="Par34">In this study, we explored the transcriptome profiles activated by Pi-deficiency stress in oil palm seedling roots by transcriptome sequencing analysis. Comparison of the sequence-based expression profiles in oil palm seedling roots grown under sufficient Pi supply and Pi-depletion condition facilitated the identification of many genes whose expression are altered by Pi deficiency. These differentially regulated genes include various nutrient transporters, signalling components and transcription factors, which are believed to be involved in coordinating oil palm responses upon Pi scarcity. The findings reported in this work would increase our understanding of the signalling cascades involved in oil palm Pi-starvation responses and help in devising strategies to develop crops with better phosphate use efficiency which can minimize fertilizer input, manpower requirement in fertilizer management and environmental pollution and can ultimately help in decreasing production cost.</p>
