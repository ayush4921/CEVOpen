0: P is the second most limiting macronutrient for crop productivity after nitrogen.
1: It acts as an essential constituent of nucleic acids important for storage and transfer of genetic information and as a structural element for a number of molecular compounds including ATP, ADP, phospholipid and coenzymes involved in energy transfer and physiological processes in plant cells [ 1].
2: P also plays a vital role in root development and in the whole reproductive process including fertilisation, seed set and fruit development [ 2].
3: P deficiency is thus expected to cause rapid and fundamental effects on crop growth and yield.
