0: In order to adapt with the persistent Pi-limiting conditions, plants have evolved a variety of adaptive strategies, collectively known as Pi starvation responses (PSR) [ 3].
1: The implementation of these strategies requires sophisticated sensing and regulatory mechanisms that can integrate external and internal Pi status [ 4].
2: PSRs generally comprised of local and systemic responses.
3: Local responses involve external Pi sensing and are regulated by local Pi status in monitoring root system architecture to enhance Pi acquisition whereas systemic or long distant responses are dependent on internal Pi concentration and include enhancement of Pi uptake, translocation and recycling of cytoplasmic Pi to maintain metabolic balance of P at the whole-plant level [ 3,  5].
4: A major part of the systemic responses in plant under Pi deprivation is regulated by PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE 1 (PHR1) and related transcription factors [ 6].
5: PHR1 mediated downstream Pi starvation-induced genes including  PHT1,  PHF1,  SPX,  PAP genes through binding to a P1BS  cis-regulatory motif (GNATATNC) present in their promoters [ 7 11].
6: Apart from PHR1, other transcription factors have also been reported to be involved in transcriptional regulation of PSR such as WRKY45, WRKY75, WRKY42, OsMYB4P, OsMYB5P, ZAT6 and bHLH32 [ 12 18].
7: Most of these factors were identified in model plants, such as Arabidopsis and rice.
8: In oil palm, however, only the high affinity phosphate transporter ( EgPHT1) has been reported.
9: Functional characterization of its promoter in homologous and heterologous model systems demonstrated that its activity is induced specifically in the roots under Pi starvation [ 19].
