<p id="Par55">A total of 48 three months old oil palm seedlings (DxP GH500) were purchased from Sime Darby Seeds &amp; Agricultural Services Sdn. Bhd and grown hydroponically for eight weeks on Pi sufficient medium which contained 5.77 mM KNO
 <sub>3</sub>, 4.25 mM Ca (NO
 <sub>3</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>, 2.1 mM MgSO
 <sub>4</sub>, 0.2 mM FeNaEDTA, 36 μM MnSO
 <sub>4</sub>, 27 μM H
 <sub>3</sub>BO
 <sub>3</sub>, 1.56 μM CuSO
 <sub>4</sub>, 0.3 μM (NH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>6</sub>Mo
 <sub>7</sub>O
 <sub>24</sub> and 1.5 mM ZnSO
 <sub>4</sub>, with 1.93 mM KH
 <sub>2</sub>PO
 <sub>4.</sub> They were then separated into two groups (+P and -P). In +P group, the plants were continuously supplied with Pi sufficient nutrient solution whereas in -P group, the plants were supplied with nutrient solution without KH
 <sub>2</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub> to induce Pi deficiency stress. KH
 <sub>2</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub> was replaced with K
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> in -P condition to maintain the concentration of K. Young roots and young leaves of both groups were harvested at the following time points: 7d, 14d, 21d and 28d.
