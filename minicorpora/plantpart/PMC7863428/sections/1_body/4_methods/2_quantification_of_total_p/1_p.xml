<p id="Par56">The fresh weight of the harvested young roots and young leaves were measured and then dried at 70 °C until constant dry weight was obtained. Dried tissues (0.25 g) were then converted to ash by burning in a furnace at 300 °C for an hour and subsequently at 500 °C for 4 h. After overnight cooling, the ash was removed from the furnace and subjected to acid digestion, then quantified using an auto-analyzer (QuikChem, Series 8000, Lachat Instruments Inc., USA). The one-way ANOVA was used to determine whether there are any statistically significant differences between the means of the (+P) and (−P) samples. The mean comparison was carried out using Duncan Multiple Range Test at α = 0.05% using SAS software version 9.4.</p>
