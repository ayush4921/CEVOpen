<p id="Par60">First-strand cDNAs were synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using Maxima First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA). The qRT-PCR was carried out on StepOne Plus (Applied Biosystems, Foster city, CA, USA) with Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster city, CA, USA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. After each run, a dissociation curve was generated to verify the amplification specificity. Three biological replicates were included for both control and treatment group and tested in triplicate. No template control was included in each run. PCR efficiencies for each primer set were analysed by amplifying serial dilutions of a mixture of all cDNA from all samples. Only primer sets that amplified with efficiency above 85% and exhibited a single and specific peak in dissociation analysis were shortlisted. All selected primer sets were listed in the Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>. Relative expression levels of all ten selected DEGs were calculated using delta-delta Ct method after normalized to three internal controls (
