<p id="Par58">RNA-Seq was performed on an Illumina HiSeq4000 platform (Novogene, Singapore) to generate 150 bp paired-end reads. After trimming the poor-quality reads and adaptor sequences, the clean reads were then mapped onto the reference genome of 
 <italic>Elaeis guineensis</italic> available in NCBI database under accession number PRJNA192219, using TopHat2 algorithm with a maximum of 2 mismatches. Transcript abundance in FPKM was estimated using HTSeq with union mode. For differential expression analysis, DESeq with a corrected
