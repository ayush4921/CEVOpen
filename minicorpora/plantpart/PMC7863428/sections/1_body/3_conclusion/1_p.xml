<p id="Par54">In summary, our RNA-Seq analysis was successfully conducted on 12 paired-end RNA libraries and the results unveiled genome wide expression profile of oil palm seedling roots in response to Pi deprivation stress. Analysis of the transcriptome datasets identified transcripts that encode diverse transcription factors, transporters and signalling components from a total of 288 DEGs. Most of the identified DEGs were consistent with the previously reported studies on Pi-starved plants including the induction of several SPX-domain containing genes and APases genes. Nevertheless, we also discovered some candidate genes such as 
 <italic>PHL7</italic>, 
 <italic>NIP6–1</italic> and 14–3-3 genes which possibly took part in the Pi-deficiency modulation and acclimation in oil palm. Transcripts, involved in sulfate remobilization and assimilation process and iron uptake, were also found to be repressed by prolonged Pi scarcity stress in oil palm. The results suggested an intricate signalling and regulation cascade governing Pi homeostasis in oil palm involving multiple metabolism pathways. These findings have improved our understanding of the Pi homeostasis in oil palm root at the molecular level and laid a solid basis for further functional characterization of those candidate genes associated with Pi-use efficiency trait in oil palm.
