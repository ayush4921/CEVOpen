<p id="Par37">Differential expression analysis revealed a total of 36 and 252 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the oil palm roots after exposure to Pi deprivation for 14d and 28d, respectively. After 14d of -P treatment, 16 (44%) genes were up-regulated and 20 (56%) genes were down-regulated whereas 91 (36%) genes were up-regulated and 161 (64%) genes were down-regulated after 28d of -P treatment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Venn diagram analysis shows that a total of seven DEGs; that is, four were up-regulated and three were down-regulated at both time points (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). There was only one transcription factor (TF) encoding PCL1-like TF gene (105044363) being up-regulated at both 14d and 28d. The PCL1-like TF is required for generation of the clock oscillation in Arabidopsis [
