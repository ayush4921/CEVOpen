<p id="Par36">To examine the effects of Pi status on the transcriptome of oil palm seedlings roots, we selected two time points (14d and 28d) and used three biological replicates per condition for RNA-Seq, together with untreated controls representing a total of 12 libraries. By using Illumina HiSeq4000 platform, a dataset containing 202.6 gigabases and 1,350,329,088 clean reads (Q30 &gt; 89%) was generated after excluding the low-quality reads. The error rate of all clean data per sample was controlled below 0.02%. Each of these samples comprised at least 99 million reads, of which more than 72% were uniquely mapped to the genome (Additional file
