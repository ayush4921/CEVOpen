<p id="Par43">To investigate the metabolic pathways involved in response to phosphate deficiency stress, we analysed the metabolism overview associated with 36 and 252 DEGs detected at 14d and 28d, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). For 14d, five DEGs were assigned into four different metabolism pathways including photosynthesis, cell wall metabolism, coenzyme metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a; Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Among 252 DEGs found at 28d, 55 genes were classified into several diverse pathways; 11 for lipid metabolism including lipid degradation and glycerolipid biosynthesis; 11 for nutrient uptake including sulfur and nitrogen assimilation; six for amino acid metabolism; six for photosynthesis, six for redox homeostasis; five for carbohydrate metabolism and five for cellular respiration; as well as several others involved in regulation of this stress such as secondary metabolism and cell wall organisation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b; Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). These results implied that distinct metabolic pathways were being triggered as part of the stress responses after 14d and 28d Pi-starvation treatment in oil palm.
