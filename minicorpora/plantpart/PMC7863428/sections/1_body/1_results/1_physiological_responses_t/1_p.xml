<p id="Par35">To assimilate the complex transcriptional responses in oil palm roots under Pi deficiency stress, we performed a time-course experiment, where 5 mon old seedlings were treated with Pi-deficient solution (0 mM Pi) for 7d, 14d, 21d and 28d. Total P content in young leaves and roots was measured to confirm the effectiveness of the Pi deprivation. In the roots, one-way ANOVA analysis indicated significant difference in the phosphate content of plants grown under the two conditions as early as 14 days after initiating the Pi treatment (

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). Total P concentration in roots was significantly reduced (37.10%) after 14d of Pi-deficiency (−P) treatment and reaching more than 46% reduction after 28d. In contrast to the dramatic decline in roots, Pi deprivation for 28d only led to a 22.4% reduction in total P content in young leaves (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Besides, the plants did not exhibit obvious growth difference in roots and leaves when observed by the naked eye until after 28d of Pi withdrawal. The plants in -P group possessed shorter primary root compared to Pi-sufficient (+P) group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). Taken together, these results confirm the effectiveness of the Pi-deficiency treatment applied in the current study.
