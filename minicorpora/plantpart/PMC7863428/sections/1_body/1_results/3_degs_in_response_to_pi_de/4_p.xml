<p id="Par41">In order to evaluate the potential functions of these identified DEGs, all of them were subjected to GO functional enrichment analysis. The top 30 most enriched GO terms were listed and grouped into three categories, namely biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). In the biological process ontology, “carbohydrate metabolic process” and “single-organism process” were the most highly represented terms in roots at 14d and 28d, respectively. Regarding molecular function, the dominant term at 14d was “hormone activity”. Meanwhile two terms (“molecular function regulator” and “enzyme regulator activity”) accounted for the majority of the molecular function ontology at 28d. The results showed that DEGs at both time points were enriched in the molecular function and biological process categories, suggesting that molecular functions and biological processes play important roles in Pi-starvation responses of oil palm.
