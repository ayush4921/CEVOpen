<p id="Par39">It is well known that macro and micro-elements are co-ordinately integrated with each other in response to fluctuation in their availability during growing condition, ranging from over excess to extreme deficiency [

Numerous transporter genes were identified in this study but most of them were down-regulated including sulfate transporter, boron transporter and nitrate transporter (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Meanwhile, some genes belonging to the same transporter family were differentially regulated upon Pi deficiency. For example, zinc (Zn) transporter 6 and Zn transporter 4 were up-regulated and down-regulated at 28d, respectively. A similar situation also occurred to members of the aquaporin gene family. All these results are implying the requisite for adjustment among multiple plant nutrients while oil palm plants encounter low Pi stress.
