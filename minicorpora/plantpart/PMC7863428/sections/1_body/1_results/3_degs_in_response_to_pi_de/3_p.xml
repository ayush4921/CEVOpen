 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Among these, the proteins belonging to the MYB and G2-like family made up the two most abundant DEGs. In plants, most of the identified MYB family proteins are associated with Pi starvation regulatory mechanism [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. All three TFs belonging to the MYB family exhibited attenuated expression patterns at 14d. Meanwhile half of the MYB proteins were up-regulated at 28d. Three TFs belonging to the G2-like family were detected from the DEG list. Remarkably, two G2-like TFs containing MYB-CC domain (105,050,046 and 105,058,550) were inversely regulated at 28d (one up-regulated and the other down-regulated). Besides, both bHLH family TFs (105,048,562 and 105,051,179) were found to be suppressed at 28d in which the latter encoding for a FER-LIKE IRON DEFICIENCY_INDUCED (FIT) TF. FIT TF is recognized as the key player in Fe homeostasis by regulating the expression of iron deficiency responsive genes [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In this study, three genes encoding TFs potentially involved in hormone signal transduction were found to be responsive to Pi deprivation stress. Two ethylene signalling-related genes (105,059,334 and 105,046,219) were up-regulated at 28d and categorized into different TF families, AP2/ERF and EIL respectively. In addition, expression of a putative scarecrow-like protein (105032345), a member of GRAS family, was highly induced in roots under low Pi stress. GRAS gene family members are involved in diverse elemental processes of plant growth and development, ranging from gibberellin acid signalling, radial root patterning and phytochrome signalling [
