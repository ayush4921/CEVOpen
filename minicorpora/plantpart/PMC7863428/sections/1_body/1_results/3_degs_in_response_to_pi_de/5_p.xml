<p id="Par42">KEGG pathway enrichment analysis was conducted to illustrate the DEG-associated pathways involved in Pi-starvation responses. There were 14 significant enriched KEGG pathways identified at 28d with q-value less than 0.05 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). Among these 14 pathways, all seven DEGs associated with the pathway of “protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum” were up-regulated. Whereas the expression of DEGs associated with the pathways (“sulfur metabolism”, “nitrogen metabolism”, “taurine and hypotaurine metabolism”, “ascorbate and aldarate metabolism”, “alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism”, “monobactam biosynthesis” and “selenocompound metabolism”) were all repressed after Pi-starvation for 28d in roots.
