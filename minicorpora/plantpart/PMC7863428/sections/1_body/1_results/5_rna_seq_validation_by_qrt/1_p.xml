<p id="Par44">To validate the deep sequencing results, the expression profiles of 10 transcripts were examined by real-time quantitative PCR on oil palm young roots exposed to Pi deficiency stress for 7d, 14d, 21d and 28d. Among the 10 genes, eight were shortlisted from the DEG list obtained from RNA-Seq analysis while two (
 <italic>PHR1</italic> and 
 <italic>PHR2</italic>) were selected as they have been extensively reported as key transcription factors that orchestrate the Pi-starvation regulations in other plant species. The results showed that the expression of eight DEGs showed similar trend (seven up-regulated and one down-regulated at 28d) to those of the RNA-Seq, suggesting the reliability of the RNA-Seq results (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). Meanwhile, the expression of 
 <italic>PHR1</italic> and 
 <italic>PHR2</italic> only experienced scarce fluctuation throughout the 28d of Pi deprivation treatment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Interestingly, the expression pattern is different between 
 <italic>PHR1</italic> and 
 <italic>PHR2</italic> in which 
 <italic>PHR1</italic> was being repressed as compared with the marginal increment in 
 <italic>PHR2</italic> transcription level. On the contrary, the expression of 
 <italic>PHR1-like 7</italic> (
 <italic>PHL7</italic>) was significantly induced at 21d and 28d. 
 <italic>NIP6–1,</italic> the DEG that was expressed at both 14d and 28d and included in the qRT-PCR analysis, was substantially up-regulated at all time points indicating that this gene possibly plays an important role in Pi-starvation regulatory mechanism in oil palm seedling roots.
