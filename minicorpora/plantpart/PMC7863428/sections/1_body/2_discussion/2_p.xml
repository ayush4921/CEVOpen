<p id="Par46">Understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms is important for developing P-use efficient crop cultivars to optimize crop yield with less investment of P fertilizer. In recent years, RNA-Seq has been extensively employed for transcriptome studies of numerous economically important crop plants under Pi deficit condition [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the transcriptomic responses of oil palm seedlings roots to Pi deficiency using RNA-Seq approach and identified two different groups of PSR genes at two time points. Under similar treatment, the number of DEGs identified at 28d was nearly seven-fold higher than that at 14d, implying that the plants responded more actively and dramatically as the time of stress increased (Fig.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. As compared to 14d, significantly higher number of DEGs participated in assorted biological processes including nutrient transport, lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism at 28d based on the metabolism overview obtained from MapMan analysis. These DEGs at 28d could be identified as ‘late’ genes that alter the physiology and metabolism of plants upon prolonged Pi deficiency [
