<p id="Par48">A highly conserved PHR1-mediated signalling cascade has been well-documented in Arabidopsis and rice [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Although AtPHR1 in Arabidopsis and its functional equivalent, OsPHR2 in rice have been demonstrated as the central player in coordinating various transcriptional regulations in response to Pi starvation, the expression of both transcripts were irrespective to Pi fluctuation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Nonetheless, the expression profiles for both 
 <italic>PHR1</italic> and 
 <italic>PHR2</italic> in oil palm were relatively stable throughout the 28d of Pi deprivation treatment as revealed in the qRT-PCR analysis. In Arabidopsis, PHR1 was shown to act redundantly with other members in the MYB-CC family, PHL1, PHL2, PHL3 and PHL4 in modulating plant transcriptional responses to Pi scarcity. Besides, the expression levels of 
 <italic>AtPHL2</italic> and 
 <italic>AtPHL3</italic> were also shown to be positively triggered by Pi starvation while the others were not affected by external Pi levels [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Meanwhile, two genes encoding PHL7 and PHL8 TFs were differentially regulated in oil palm seedling roots at 28d. By possessing a common MYB domain and a coiled-coil domain, both proteins might also play a key role in controlling oil palm transcriptional responses to Pi deficiency similar to their orthologue in Arabidopsis. Moreover, 
 <italic>PHL7</italic> was significantly induced starting from 21d to 28d in Pi-starved oil palm root tissues as revealed in the qPCR analysis. The distinctive transcription pattern of these two TFs under low Pi stress suggested that they may be regulated by different molecular components.
