<p id="Par50">Induction and secretion of intracellular and/or extracellular APases are considered to be an important acclimation strategy for plant tolerance under low Pi environment which has been documented in diverse crop plants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. PAPs represented the largest class of plant APases that could be secreted into the rhizosphere to hydrolyse organic P compounds whereas the intracellular PAPs could facilitate the Pi remobilization from internal reservoir. With the presence of P1BS motifs in their promoters, PAP genes are positively controlled by the PHR1-mediated Pi starvation signalling pathway [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Accretion of APases transcripts was commonly reported in several recent transcriptomic studies involving Pi-starved soybean, maize and banana [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Therefore, it is expected that three APases genes were positively stimulated at 28d. Transgenic plants overexpressing PAP gene depicted increased APase activities, leading to the enhanced use of external organic P sources, higher plant biomass and eventually improved plant growth under Pi limitation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. Hence, these differentially regulated PAP genes deserve further studies with regards to their roles in Pi scavenging and recycling.
