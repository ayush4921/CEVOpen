<p id="Par45">Plants frequently encounter low Pi availability in soils and have thus established a series of adaptive morphological, physiological and biochemical strategies to cope with Pi deficiency. Modification of root growth and architecture is a well-documented morphological response to Pi starvation including reduction of primary root length [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In addition, a decline of P concentration in Pi-deprived plants has been reported in other plant species under similar -P treatment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In contrast to the distinct declination in young roots, the total P content in young leaves was consistent throughout the treatment period. This probably was caused by Pi homeostasis in the plant where re-translocation of Pi from older leaves to younger leaves occurred during Pi starvation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Interestingly, the total P content in young roots was slightly increased (9%) at 28d compared to 21d. This could be the adaptive response by plant under severe phosphate deficiency where roots will become a sink tissue rather than a source tissue in order to enhance root proliferation and soil exploration [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Thus, 14d and 28d were selected for investigating the early and late responses of oil palm roots under Pi starvation stress through RNA-Seq.
