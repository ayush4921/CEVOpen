<p id="Par53">The critical roles of TFs in modulating the transcription alterations of their downstream target genes when plants encounter Pi scarcity situation has been well reviewed [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. Among the Pi-starvation responsive DEGs in the current study, 22 TFs belonging to several families consisting of MYB, WRKY, AP2/ERF, zing finger proteins and bHLH were identified with MYB family members accounting the majority. MYB TFs can be divided into different classes based on the number and types of the conserved MYB repeats present in their DNA-binding domain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. Here, the seven identified MYB TFs can be divided into two classes, namely R2R3-MYB (105,045,660, 105,054,880 and 105,059,220) and 1R-MYB (105,055,259, 105,058,870, 105,059,546 and 105,040,489). In fact, the three G2-like family TFs (105,044,363, 105,050,046 and 105,058,550) were also grouped into 1R-MYB family as they possess a single MYB repeat at their N-terminus. In addition, Pi-deficiency was also shown to alter the expression of several ERF genes, a group of AP2 domain-containing TFs that are involved in ethylene-responsive genes regulation in Arabidopsis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. Liu et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>] also established the crucial role of ethylene-insensitive 3 (EIN3) and ethylene-insensitive 3-like (EIL1) in coordinating the ethylene-mediated Pi-starvation responses through activation of PHR1 transcription. Therefore, the two Pi-deficiency induced ethylene-related TFs (105,059,334 and 105,046,219) may contribute in Pi-deficiency regulation mechanism in oil palm although their exact roles need to be further testified.
