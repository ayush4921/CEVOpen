<p id="Par51">Among the identified DEGs, many genes are possibly involved in transportation of water, sulfate, zinc and other nutrients other than Pi. Pi deprivation has been shown to diminish plants root hydraulic conductivity and causes disruption of water transport [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. Three aquaporin encoding genes were differentially modulated in Pi deprived oil palm seedling roots. A putative aquaporin 
 <italic>PIP2–2</italic> (105044284) was down-regulated at 14d of -Pi treatment and the same expression profile was also reported for all six PIP genes in Pi-starved sheep grass [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. Meanwhile, the expression of a candidate aquaporin 
 <italic>NIP6–1</italic> gene (105038152) was constantly up-regulated in this study with the highest expression level at 7d as revealed in qRT-PCR analysis. NIPs may play a role in plant stress responses since the activity of these proteins would be enhanced by phosphorylation under stress conditions. Transgenic plants overexpressing aquaporins showed higher tolerance to environment stresses [

 <italic>NIP6–1</italic> in oil palm Pi stress regulation mechanism through functional characterization.
