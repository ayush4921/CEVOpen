<p id="Par47">14–3-3 proteins are a family of phosphoserine-binding proteins that are able to recognize and bind to the well-defined phosphorylated motifs of a number of target proteins via direct interaction. Their association to a phosphorylated target can eventually alter its subcellular localization, protein stability, enzyme activities and /or protein-protein interactions [

 <italic>GRF9</italic> encoding a 14–3-3 isoform has demonstrated its role in the regulation of metabolic pathways during Pi-starvation responses in Arabidopsis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Moreover, 14–3-3 proteins were found to modulate plasma membrane H
 <sup>+</sup>-ATPase functioning in Pi acquisition and enzyme activities involved in carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolism, which is one of the plant adaptations to low Pi stress [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] also reported that two 14–3-3 isoforms, 
 <italic>TFT6</italic> and 
 <italic>TFT7</italic> that were differentially expressed in tomato plants displayed distinct roles in acclimation to Pi deficiency. In this study, Pi deficiency was found to suppress all four 14–3-3 proteins (105,041,596, 105,037,590, 105,041,440 and 105,037,838) expression in oil palm seedling roots. Hence, the role of 14–3-3 proteins in Pi homeostasis deserves further studies since 14–3-3 s have been shown to be involved in various cellular processes including plant hormone signalling and biosynthesis [
