 <caption> Species lists for the initial and most recent sample years. “Sum Cover” represents the summed cover for each species over all 15 plots for that year. “C” represents the species’ Coefficient of Conservatism, using values from [ 31]. Species nomenclature has been updated to that of [ 81]. Species in bold are adventive. Species marked with “*” in the 2019 list were not found in the 1985–6 sample and were present in the seed mix (see S1 Table). (PDF) </caption>
