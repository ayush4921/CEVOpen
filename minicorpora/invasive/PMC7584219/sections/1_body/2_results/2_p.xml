 <xref rid="pone.0241061.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> presents the model output for each of the five indices calculated, including an indication of the best model fit for each index. 
 <xref rid="pone.0241061.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> provides critical values for use in comparing models. As shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0241061.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, for none of the indices was the random walk (null) model the best fit, suggesting that each index could be modeled with a predictable pattern, rather than merely representing “noise.”
