<p>Native seed addition has been experimentally shown to increase the rate at which both grassland and woodland restorations increase plant biodiversity [

 <xref rid="pone.0241061.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Long-term chronosequences of high-quality prairie restorations show that plot FQIs are best explained by the initial FQI of the restoration seed mix [
 <xref rid="pone.0241061.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. They also show that seed mix composition strongly influences the restorationâ€™s composition [
 <xref rid="pone.0241061.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. In our case, the Mean 
 <italic>C</italic> of the seed list was 6.2, compared to a value of 4.9 for the 2019 species list (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0241061.s002">S2</xref> Tables). This seeding effect is not surprising given that recovery of plant communities in successional habitats, woodlands, and even mature forests is highly limited by seed [

 <xref rid="pone.0241061.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. While woodland studies have most often focused on the lack of recovery by specific groups such as spring ephemerals or slow-dispersing species such as myrmechores (ant-dispersed), we would suggest that conservative species in general should be assumed propagule/seed limited when it comes to habitat restoration. This may be due, but not limited to, their dispersibility (e.g., less seed production, slower growth rates, limited local source populations [
