<p>While other studies have shown strong responses of Floristic Quality measures to ecological management (e.g., deer overgrazing and Mean 
 <italic>C</italic>; [

 <xref rid="pone.0241061.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]). Once degraded, habitats are more often difficult to restore, and relatively few projects meet their conservation goals, with FQA and diversity levels peaking at low levels [

 <xref rid="pone.0241061.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. We suggest two primary reasons to explain the success documented in the current study. First, most studies have implemented/examined only a single management technique in restoration. Studies investigating more than one technique are less common, but they tend towards greater success (e.g., fire and seeding [
 <xref rid="pone.0241061.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]; fire and stand thinning [
 <xref rid="pone.0241061.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]; and the current study). Second, even fewer studies have monitored management and restoration for as long as the current 34-year study.
