<p>The long-term increase we observed in Floristic Quality, but not necessarily diversity, is perhaps best deconstructed using the data shown in Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0241061.g006">6</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0241061.g007">7</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0241061.s002">S2 Table</xref>, which provide a detailed portrait of community compositional change. Here, we illustrate species turnover from a badly degraded community toward one comprised of a diverse array of species types that included those of high-quality, remnant habitats. These most conservative species (C = 7â€“10) did not appear to change rapidly during the management disruption, but instead steadily increased over time, perhaps in response to the establishment of a native species matrix and the return of natural processes such as fire. The least conservative species (C = A-0) declined steadily, with the decline slowed during periods of management neglect. It was, however, the species of intermediate C-value that fluctuated more widely and were perhaps more responsive to the two periods of management disruption. We suggest that separating species into classes this way and observing their distinct changes provides a nuanced perspective that will allow restoration practitioners to more fully understand and respond to changes in the plant community.
