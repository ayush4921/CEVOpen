<p>In our study, species richness showed no significant change over time—it reached its overall mean value early in the study and remained stable thereafter. Despite the increase in species richness, to have relied on this index alone to describe this site would have led to the incorrect conclusion that little had changed since 1988. Mean H’ (Shannon-Weiner Index) or evenness also showed no overall change over time and would have supported this incorrect conclusion. On their own, these measures would have been inadequate for making conservation decisions at the study site, compared to indices that more directly incorporated changes in species composition. Taft et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0241061.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] also found Mean 
 <italic>C</italic> and FQI to be better than several standard diversity indices (e.g. species richness, Simpson Index, Shannon-Weiner Index) for distinguishing between relatively disturbed remnant and reconstructed prairie units (but see [
