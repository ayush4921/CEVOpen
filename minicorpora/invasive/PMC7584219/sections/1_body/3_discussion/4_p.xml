<p>There is no doubt that a pristine, remnant oak woodland with its full plant assemblage and without modern anthropogenic degradation would have even greater native diversity (α and β) and Floristic Quality numbers than those reached at our study site. This fuller spectrum of species would include a greater diversity of phenologies, specialists, functional groups or guilds [

But for a reference community comparison, we looked to Middlefork Savanna, a nearby silt-loam oak savanna/woodland complex considered the highest-quality, least degraded, native remnant of this habitat type in the region (i.e., northern Illinois; [
