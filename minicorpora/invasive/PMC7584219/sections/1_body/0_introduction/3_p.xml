<p>Tracking management outcomes requires effective indices that can convey both short-term changes and long-term trends in vegetation. Many indices, with varying degrees of complexity, have been developed to describe the biodiversity and integrity of biological communities, and opinions vary as to which are the most useful (see [

 <xref rid="pone.0241061.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]). Plant diversity measures via a simple species count, or evenness measures such as the Shannon index, are two of the most commonly used (e.g., [

 <xref rid="pone.0241061.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]) and easily understood [

 <xref rid="pone.0241061.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] introduced Floristic Quality Assessment (FQA) to provide a means of distinguishing differences among plant communities, based on the degree to which their component species are reflective of high-conservation value, native remnant habitats that are relatively free of anthropogenic disturbance. “Floristic Quality” is measured via two principal metrics: the Floristic Quality Index (FQI) and the Mean

 <xref rid="pone.0241061.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]). They also have been used to describe changes within plant communities over time (e.g., [
 <xref rid="pone.0241061.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0241061.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
