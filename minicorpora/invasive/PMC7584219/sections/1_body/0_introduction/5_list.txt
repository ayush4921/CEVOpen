0: To learn how a degraded oak woodlands plant community changed under a long-term, multi-treatment, ecological management regime.To investigate which of five common metrics would best quantify management success/failure and restoration progress over the life of the study, as measured by the plant communitys diversity and conservation value.To learn how an abrupt, mid-study cessation of the management treatments affected the woodland recovery.To evaluate the ability of the five metrics to reflect this mid-study disruption in management, as quickly detecting and adjusting to change is the key to successful restoration work (i.e., adaptive management).
