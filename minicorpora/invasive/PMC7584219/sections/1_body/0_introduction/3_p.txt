0: Tracking management outcomes requires effective indices that can convey both short-term changes and long-term trends in vegetation.
1: Many indices, with varying degrees of complexity, have been developed to describe the biodiversity and integrity of biological communities, and opinions vary as to which are the most useful (see [ 9, 24 27]).
2: Plant diversity measures via a simple species count, or evenness measures such as the Shannon index, are two of the most commonly used (e.g., [ 28, 29]) and easily understood [ 30].
3: Other indices have been developed to more directly assess changes in plant community composition.
4: For example, Swink and Wilhelm [ 31] introduced Floristic Quality Assessment (FQA) to provide a means of distinguishing differences among plant communities, based on the degree to which their component species are reflective of high-conservation value, native remnant habitats that are relatively free of anthropogenic disturbance.
5: Floristic Quality is measured via two principal metrics: the Floristic Quality Index (FQI) and the Mean  C (for further description see Indices below).
6: These have been widely used to distinguish habitat quality, conservation value, management history, successional status, and restoration success among habitat types (e.g., [ 12, 26, 32 35]).
7: They also have been used to describe changes within plant communities over time (e.g., [ 8, 23, 36]).
