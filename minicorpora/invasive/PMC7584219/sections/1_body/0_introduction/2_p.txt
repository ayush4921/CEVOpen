0: To this point, most studies have examined specific individual management techniques (e.g., fire [ 11]; brush removal [ 12]), despite the fact that few land managers employ only a single management technique at a given site.
1: Because ecological processes, stressors, or management actions may interact synergistically or antagonistically in combination [ 13, 14], studies examining multiple ecological management treatments simultaneously may be especially useful for land managers.
2: In addition, long-term studies of management impacts are rare (but see [ 15 17]).
3: Given limited time and resources, most restorations undergoing ecological management stop monitoring vegetation after 36 years and rarely extend past ten years (e.g., wetland mitigation projects, [ 18 20]).
4: However, changes in plant communities can be highly irregular over time, and habitats often quickly regress after initial, short-term improvement.
5: This instability is especially common in young restorations and/or where exotic species take hold [ 9, 21 23].
6: Therefore, long-term, multi-technique studies of management/restoration regimes are needed to illustrate where and why lasting restoration success occurs and to provide the most actionable information to land managers.
