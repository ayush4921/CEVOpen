<p>Oak woodlands often show little or no recovery over time after they have been degraded [

 <bold>to</bold> lack of fire, excess shade from fire-intolerant species (“mesophication”), invasive species, deer overpopulation, habitat fragmentation, and/or a lack of native plant propagules [

 <xref rid="pone.0241061.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Ecological management is widely agreed to be necessary to overcome these barriers to the restoration of woodland health and diversity. However, in modern landscapes, unpredictable and disappointing outcomes often characterize both actively restored natural areas and those undergoing passive succession [

 <xref rid="pone.0241061.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Even very expensive vegetation restoration projects fail to meet their conservation goals more often than not (e.g., as measured by plant conservation and biodiversity metrics; [
