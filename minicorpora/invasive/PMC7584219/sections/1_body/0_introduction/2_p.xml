<p>To this point, most studies have examined specific individual management techniques (e.g., fire [

 <xref rid="pone.0241061.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], studies examining multiple ecological management treatments simultaneously may be especially useful for land managers. In addition, long-term studies of management impacts are rare (but see [

 <xref rid="pone.0241061.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]). Given limited time and resources, most restorations undergoing ecological management stop monitoring vegetation after 3–6 years and rarely extend past ten years (e.g., wetland mitigation projects, [

 <xref rid="pone.0241061.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]). However, changes in plant communities can be highly irregular over time, and habitats often quickly regress after initial, short-term improvement. This instability is especially common in young restorations and/or where exotic species take hold [

 <xref rid="pone.0241061.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Therefore, long-term, multi-technique studies of management/restoration regimes are needed to illustrate where and why lasting restoration success occurs and to provide the most actionable information to land managers.
