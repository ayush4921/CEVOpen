0: The first sampling was done in fall 1985 and spring 1986, and the two were combined to constitute the 85/86 sample.
1: Although the first seeding was done in fall 1985, we considered the initial sampling to provide a good representation of pre-seeding vegetation, as the seeded species would not have emerged sufficiently in 1986 to be recognized or counted in spring samples.
2: The fall 1985 data come from a different arbitrary transect that had been established separate from the current study.
3: This transect was very near (4.1 meters from) and parallel to the 1986 permanent transect.
4: Previous studies confirm that years effects are generally negligible for our chosen indices [ 45].
