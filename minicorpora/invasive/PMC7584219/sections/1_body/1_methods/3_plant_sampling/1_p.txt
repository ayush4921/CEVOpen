0: Fifteen circular, 1-m 2 permanent plots were established in 1986, beginning at a random location and continuing at 10-m intervals along a 150-m linear transect through Vestal Grove.
1: The transect was marked by metal posts placed at 50-m intervals.
2: Plots were placed one meter north of the transect.
3: Species name and direct estimates of percent aerial cover for all herbaceous plants were recorded, as well as of those woody plants with foliage below one meter tall.
4: In order to represent both early and later season flora, plots were sampled twicein late spring and late summer.
5: To compile a single sample, the species lists from the two plot samples were combined and, if a species was sampled at both times, the larger cover value was used.
6: The transect was sampled roughly every two years.
