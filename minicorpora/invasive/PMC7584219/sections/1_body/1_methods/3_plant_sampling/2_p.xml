<p>The first sampling was done in fall 1985 and spring 1986, and the two were combined to constitute the 85/86 sample. Although the first seeding was done in fall 1985, we considered the initial sampling to provide a good representation of pre-seeding vegetation, as the seeded species would not have emerged sufficiently in 1986 to be recognized or counted in spring samples. The fall 1985 data come from a different arbitrary transect that had been established separate from the current study. This transect was very near (4.1 meters from) and parallel to the 1986 permanent transect. Previous studies confirm that years effects are generally negligible for our chosen indices [
