0: We compared change over time in the values of several biodiversity and conservation indices commonly used to reflect ecosystem health or biological degradation.
1: We calculated these indices for all species as well as for native species only.
2: Species richness was a simple species count, represented as a per-plot mean.
3: Mean  C was the average Coefficient of Conservatism ( C) for the species within the plots, taken as a per-plot mean.
4: Each plant in the Chicago region has previously been assigned a  C-value by collective, expert judgment to indicate the degree to which the species is faithful to high-quality, remnant, natural communities [ 31].
5: C-values are integers that range from 0 to 10.
6: The species virtually restricted to high-quality natural areas have  C-values of 9 or 10, whereas species that may also occur in habitats that have been badly damaged by anthropogenic disturbance have been given  C-values of 0 or 1.
