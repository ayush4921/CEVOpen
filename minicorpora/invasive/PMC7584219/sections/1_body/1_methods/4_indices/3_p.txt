0: For the mean Cover-weighted FQI per plot, we first calculated Cover-weighted Mean  C as follows:  i=1Scipii=1Spi, where  c is the C-value of species  i, and  p is the percent cover of species  i within the plot, for all  S species within the plot.
1: We then used this Cover-weighted Mean  C in the calculation of FQI, as above.
