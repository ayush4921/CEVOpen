<p>We compared change over time in the values of several biodiversity and conservation indices commonly used to reflect ecosystem health or biological degradation. We calculated these indices for all species as well as for native species only. Species richness was a simple species count, represented as a per-plot mean. Mean 
 <italic>C</italic> was the average Coefficient of Conservatism (
 <italic>C</italic>) for the species within the plots, taken as a per-plot mean. Each plant in the Chicago region has previously been assigned a 
 <italic>C</italic>-value by collective, expert judgment to indicate the degree to which the species is faithful to high-quality, remnant, natural communities [
 <xref rid="pone.0241061.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. 
 <italic>C</italic>-values are integers that range from 0 to 10. The species virtually restricted to high-quality natural areas have 
 <italic>C</italic>-values of 9 or 10, whereas species that may also occur in habitats that have been badly damaged by anthropogenic disturbance have been given 
 <italic>C</italic>-values of 0 or 1.
