<p>Plant removal or control had two goals: 1) to remove invasive (largely non-native) species, and 2) to open up the area’s oak woodland canopy to better reflect the needs of more light-demanding woodland/savanna species. We largely eliminated a patchy but dense population of 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> (garlic mustard) by pulling. We initially scythed 
 <italic>Cirsium arvense</italic> (creeping thistle), 
 <italic>Rubus</italic> spp. (briars), and 
 <italic>Solidago altissima</italic> (tall goldenrod), but they seemed to decrease over time on their own, so we did not target them thereafter. It should be noted that of the 10 non-native species in the initial sample area (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0241061.s002">S2 Table</xref>), we made no effort to control or directly remove seven of them at any time (we controlled only 
 <italic>Rhamnus cathartica</italic>, 
 <italic>Lonicera tatarica</italic>, and 
 <italic>Cirsium vulgare</italic>). For the first 13 years, we controlled invasive brush such as 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>cathartica</italic> by burning alone, which top-killed the stems. Most of them re-sprouted between burns, with multiple small stems per plant. During the management moratorium (see below), these re-sprouts grew to dense stands, 1- to 2.5-meters tall. In 2003, at the end of the moratorium, we cut all large invasive stems, treated the stumps with 20% Garlon, and foliar-sprayed re-sprouts with 3–5% Garlon. In recent years, we have cut maturing trees (under ≈50 cm [20 inch] diameter-at-breast height) to increase understory light to levels that would likely support bur oak reproduction [
