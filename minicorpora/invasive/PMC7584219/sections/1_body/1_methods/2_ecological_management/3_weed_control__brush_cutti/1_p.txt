0: Plant removal or control had two goals: 1) to remove invasive (largely non-native) species, and 2) to open up the areas oak woodland canopy to better reflect the needs of more light-demanding woodland/savanna species.
1: We largely eliminated a patchy but dense population of  Alliaria petiolata (garlic mustard) by pulling.
2: We initially scythed  Cirsium arvense (creeping thistle),  Rubus spp.
3: (briars), and  Solidago altissima (tall goldenrod), but they seemed to decrease over time on their own, so we did not target them thereafter.
4: It should be noted that of the 10 non-native species in the initial sample area ( S2 Table), we made no effort to control or directly remove seven of them at any time (we controlled only  Rhamnus cathartica,  Lonicera tatarica, and  Cirsium vulgare).
5: For the first 13 years, we controlled invasive brush such as  R.  cathartica by burning alone, which top-killed the stems.
6: Most of them re-sprouted between burns, with multiple small stems per plant.
7: During the management moratorium (see below), these re-sprouts grew to dense stands, 1- to 2.5-meters tall.
8: In 2003, at the end of the moratorium, we cut all large invasive stems, treated the stumps with 20% Garlon, and foliar-sprayed re-sprouts with 35% Garlon.
9: In recent years, we have cut maturing trees (under 50 cm [20 inch] diameter-at-breast height) to increase understory light to levels that would likely support bur oak reproduction [ 40].
10: This included cutting all non-native, and some native trees.
