<p>In the fall of 1996, a restoration “moratorium” was instated by the FPCC board president, and all vegetation management techniques (described above) were halted on all sites in the District in response to a campaign of protests against controlled burns, use of herbicide, and cutting trees. The moratorium was gradually lifted, but the Vestal Grove transect area went without management from September 1996 until July 2003. Staff and volunteers resumed restoration activities with a major brush cut on 12 July 2003 and a burn on 9 November 2004. Regular management has continued since this time, as described above. (For more on the management of this site, see [
