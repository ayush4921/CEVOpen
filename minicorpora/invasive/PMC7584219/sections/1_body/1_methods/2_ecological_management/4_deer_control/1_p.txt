0: While regional white-tailed deer population numbers have been extraordinarily high for some time [ 41], unsystematic deer counts and site stewards observations of unusually heavy browse on even less-preferred plant species provided anecdotal indications that deer numbers at Somme Prairie Grove increased dramatically between 199193 (personal communication).
1: In accordance, FPCC census counts estimated deer numbers in the area had risen to more than 62 deer per km 2 by 1991 (unpublished data).
2: Because of excessive deer-automobile collisions and because the ecosystem is believed to sustainably support only 3 to 6 deer per km 2 (e.g., pre-European settlement [ 42, 43]), both FPCC and the surrounding Village of Northbrook began deer control programs to reduce their numbers on site in 1993.
3: By 1994, these programs had brought the numbers down substantially (unpublished FPCC data).
4: Deer culling has continued since then.
