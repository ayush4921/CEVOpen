0: In fall 1985, we began the first of several annual seed broadcasts in an attempt to restore a native vegetation matrix.
1: Seed mixes included 129 species characteristic of open oak woodlands [ 31, 39] and were collected from spontaneous populations within 25 miles of the study site ( S1 Table).
2: After the end of the moratorium, we again broadcast seed over the entire area annually for two years.
3: In recent years, seed broadcasts have been occasional and focused in the small areas where the canopy had recently been thinned by pole tree removal.
4: Not all species were seeded in every broadcast, with the largest numbers concentrated in the initial two years and the two post-moratorium years.
5: Some seeds were more available for collection in some years than others, and the supplemental broadcasts were limited to the species deemed most appropriate for these smaller target areas.
