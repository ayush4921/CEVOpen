<p>In fall 1985, we began the first of several annual seed broadcasts in an attempt to restore a native vegetation matrix. Seed mixes included 129 species characteristic of open oak woodlands [

In recent years, seed broadcasts have been occasional and focused in the small areas where the canopy had recently been thinned by pole tree removal. Not all species were seeded in every broadcast, with the largest numbers concentrated in the initial two years and the two post-moratorium years. Some seeds were more available for collection in some years than others, and the supplemental broadcasts were limited to the species deemed most appropriate for these smaller target areas.
