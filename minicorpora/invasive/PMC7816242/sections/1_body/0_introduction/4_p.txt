0: Here we report the results of a field experiment in which we independently manipulated temperature and reproductive phenology, specifically, timing of seed release.
1: We focus on musk thistle ( Carduus nutans L.), a widespread invasive species that advances flowering in response to warming (Zhang et al.
2: 2012).
3: Musk thistle is a monocarpic perennial with sizedependent reproduction.
4: Changes in growth are therefore expected to directly affect the musk thistle life cycle and hence its demography.
5: We consider the joint impacts of warming and advanced reproductive phenology across the full life cycle of  C. nutans using demographic models, and address the following:
