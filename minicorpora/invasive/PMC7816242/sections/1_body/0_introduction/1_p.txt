0: Climate warming has caused changes in many organisms phenology (Parmesan and Yohe  2003, Cleland et al.
1: 2007).
2: Changes in phenology may affect demography, but generally the demographic consequences of phenological shifts remain unclear (MillerRushing et al.
3: 2010, but see Ozgul et al.
4: 2010, Iler et al.
5: 2019, Macgregor et al.
6: 2019, Paniw et al.
7: 2019).
8: Although phenologys effects on individuals performance have been documented in numerous cases (Van Dongen et al.
9: 1997, Colautti and Barrett  2013, Scheepens and Stocklin  2013), linking differences in performance to demographic outcomes is difficult, as changes in traits do not always lead to changes in population dynamics (McLean et al.
10: 2016).
11: Observational work suggests that phenological sensitivity may underlie changes in species abundance over time, however.
12: More phenologically sensitive plant and bird species, for example, are less likely to have declined in abundance over time (Mller et al.
13: 2008, Willis et al.
14: 2008).
15: Additionally, high phenological sensitivity may contribute to the growth of invasive populations (Willis et al.
16: 2010).
17: Together, these trends suggest a link between phenology and demography, but mechanisms driving those links remain elusive.
