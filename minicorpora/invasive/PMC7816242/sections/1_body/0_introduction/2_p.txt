0: Full understanding of demographic consequences of phenological shifts requires consideration of organisms full life cycles.
1: Changes in the timing of plants leaf out, for example, may affect duration of growth before flowering, timing of flowering, timing of germination, and thereby the growth and survival of newly produced offspring (Johnson  1993).
2: When organisms full life cycles have been considered, the phenologymediated impacts of climate warming on demography have been substantial.

4: ( 2010), for example, found earlier spring emergence from hibernation among yellowbellied marmots led to earlier births and lengthened the growing season for new offspring, allowing them to reach larger sizes before hibernation, which in turn reduced mortality and led to rapid population growth (Ozgul et al.
5: 2010).
