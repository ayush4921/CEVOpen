<p>The combined effects of earlier reproductive phenology and increased survival and growth under warming increased both the projected mean size at reproduction and the projected annual population growth rate of musk thistle. Under our moderate warming conditions, we project mean longest leaf length in the fall before individuals reproduce will increase by 1.3 cm (95% CI [0.72, 1.80]). Further, we project that the annual population growth rate will significantly increase with warming and advanced flowering phenology (mean difference in λ = 6.08; 95% CI [3.92, 9.48]; current conditions λ = 40.5; future conditions λ = 46.6). This projection represents a 15.0% increase in the annual population growth rate. After just 5 yr of population growth, this change in the population growth rate increases the projected population size by a factor of 2.01, roughly doubling the projected size of a population growing under warming compared to a population under current conditions, regardless of the initial population size.</p>
