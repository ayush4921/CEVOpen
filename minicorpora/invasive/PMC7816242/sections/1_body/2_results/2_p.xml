<p>The size distribution of new recruits was strongly related to the date on which seeds were released. Median seedling size trended with date of seed release (Mann‐Kendall trend test, tau = −0.901,

 <xref rid="ecy3219-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>: Fig. S2). Seeds that were released early in the year reached substantially larger rosette sizes than later‐released seeds. Some small individuals (longest leaf length &lt; 2 cm), are projected to occur even with very early seed release phenology, though; 6.0% of seedlings were projected to fall in this size range even for our earliest considered date of full flowering, 13 June.
