<p>We did not detect a significant change in the average age at reproduction under warming (mean difference in mean age = −0.048 yr; 95% CI [−0.13, 0.02]). This apparent lack of difference, however, was the result of two opposing trends that both affect mean age at reproduction. Increased new recruit sizes and increased growth caused a greater proportion of individuals to reproduce at younger ages, while increased survival caused more of the individuals that do defer reproduction to successfully survive until they do reproduce, which increased numbers of older individuals reproducing. On balance, these trends result in little change in mean age at reproduction under warming.</p>
