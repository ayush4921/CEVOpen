<p>Our work has implications for which measures are used to infer changes in life history in future climates. Despite the observed increase in the proportion of individuals flowering as annuals (rather than biennials or perennials), we did not detect a significant change in the average age at reproduction under warming. This is because mean age at reproduction is affected by two processes acting in opposite directions. A higher proportion of individuals reproduced at younger ages, but increased survival caused more longer‚Äêlived individuals to successfully survive to reproduction. This work thus provides a caution that considering only the mean age at reproduction may mask important underlying shifts in the life cycle.</p>
