<p>The scenario for which we make projections is an important, but specific, case. We focused on a population growing with limited competition, which parallels the agricultural environment in which musk thistle is most economically costly. The λ values we calculated under these conditions are large, as might be expected for the initial population growth rate of an invasive species growing in a newly disturbed without competition or density dependence. Taking a broader view, the impacts of advanced phenology are likely to also depend on the community in which the musk thistle population is situated. Musk thistle’s demography in the future will also be impacted by the relative phenological shifts of interacting mutualists such as pollinators, competitors including native flora and agricultural crops, and consumers including specialist natural enemies that attack rosettes and flowering individuals.</p>
