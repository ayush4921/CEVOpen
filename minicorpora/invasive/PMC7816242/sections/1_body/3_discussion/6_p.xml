<p>Accelerated population growth of problematic invasive species will threaten food security (Godfray et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3219-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>) and potentially cause significant challenges for managers tasked with controlling them. Managers will need to increase effort, or to consider different or auxiliary management strategies to achieve acceptable intervention outcomes in the future. Building an understanding of how warming and phenological shifts interact to affect species demography in a wide range of species life histories will be an essential component of plans to mitigate the impact of anthropogenic climate change. Here, we have shown that warming is expected to increase the annual population growth rate of a widespread invasive species by 15.0%, threatening the productivity of pastures and rangelands. Similar changes may be observed for many other pest species. A mechanistic understanding of how phenology impacts demography may also shed light on why species that do not shift phenology with warming are more likely to decline in abundance (Willis et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3219-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). Understanding phenology’s role in populations’ growth or decline will be important to guide conservation efforts aimed at preserving species that are negatively impacted by climate change and also efforts to prevent increases in the impacts of invasive species.
