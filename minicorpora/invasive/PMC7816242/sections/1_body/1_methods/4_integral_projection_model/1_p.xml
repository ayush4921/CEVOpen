<p>To investigate the effects of warming and altered phenology on musk thistle population dynamics and life history patterns, we constructed integral projection models (IPMs; Fig.

 <xref rid="ecy3219-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). We used the natural logarithm of rosettes’ longest leaf length, in centimeters, as our measure of size, the state variable 
 <italic>z</italic>. This measure is a reliable estimator of individuals’ size, which has been previously shown to be an important predictor of musk thistle vital rates (Shea and Kelly 
 <xref rid="ecy3219-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">1998</xref>). We used an annual time step from early November to early November, which captures plant size after individuals have stopped growing for the season but before leaves are possibly damaged by repeated frost. Our study had high initial germination, and germination after the first season was rare. Also, our projections are aimed at capturing the potential for newly established populations (with no existing seedbank) to grow in disturbed areas, i.e., the growth rate is intended to capture the initial trajectory rather than the longer term dynamics. In addition, vital rates associated with the musk thistle seed bank have low elasticity (Jongejans et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3219-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). For these reasons, we did not include a seedbank in our model for this study. Generally, including a seed bank decreases the growth rate for rapidly growing populations (Nguyen et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3219-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>), so this choice may slightly inflate our projected population growth rates.
