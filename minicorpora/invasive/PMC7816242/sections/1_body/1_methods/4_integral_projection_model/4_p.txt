0: To investigate the life cycle impacts of shifting phenology and altered vital rates, we projected outcomes for cohorts produced by mother plants that flowered on different dates with vital rates corresponding to different temperatures.
1: We projected cohorts through 10 yr and tracked the proportion of individuals that died before flowering and the proportions that flowered as annuals, as biennials, or as longerlived perennials.
