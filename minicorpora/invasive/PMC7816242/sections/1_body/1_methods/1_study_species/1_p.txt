0: Musk thistle,  Carduus nutans L. (Asteraceae), is a weed of Eurasian origin and a pest in pastures and rangelands, where its spiny leaves inhibit grazing, reducing livestock productivity (Desrochers et al.
1: 1988).
2: This thistle has invaded disturbed areas in North America, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand (Jongejans et al.
3: 2008).
4: It is widespread in North America (USDA NRCS  2012).
5: Musk thistle is a shortlived monocarpic perennial.
6: Individuals germinate in the fall or spring and can persist for one to several years as rosettes before bolting, flowering, releasing winddispersed seeds, and dying (Desrochers et al.
7: 1988).
8: Musk thistle is a prolific seed producer, with individual plants capable of producing thousands of winddispersed seeds that germinate well immediately following release (Popay et al.
9: 1987).
