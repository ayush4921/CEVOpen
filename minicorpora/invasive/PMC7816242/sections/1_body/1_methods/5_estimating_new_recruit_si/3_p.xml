<p>We modeled the effect of shifts in flowering date on recruit sizes by changing the date of flowering and associated distribution of seed release dates. We assumed that the distribution of seed release probabilities after first flowering was not altered by changing date of first flowering. When modeling seed release occurring earlier than the earliest seed release date in the dataset from our field experiment, we assumed that the size distribution of offspring produced by seeds released at earlier dates was the same as the distribution on our earliest date. This assumption is supported by measurements of rosette sizes in naturally occurring populations of musk thistle, where rosettes larger than those at the upper end of our estimated size distribution are extremely rare (Joseph Keller,
