0: We conducted a twocohort field experiment at the Russell E. Larson Agricultural Research Farm in Rock Springs, Pennsylvania, USA (latitude 40.71 N, longitude 77.94 W).
1: The site was prepared before planting each cohort by applying a miller offset disk two times to kill aboveground vegetation and then applying a roller harrow to level the soil surface.
2: This preparation mimicked the type of disturbance that promotes musk thistle establishment along roadsides and in pastures.
3: Aboveground competition was suppressed by clipping all vegetation other than our focal thistles down to the soil surface weekly to avoid a possible interaction between temperature treatments and vegetative competition.
4: We manipulated temperature using fiberglass cone open top chambers (OTCs) with basal diameter of 1.48 m constructed according to the International Tundra Experiment Manual (Molau and Mlgaard  1996).
5: Throughout the experiment, temperature was monitored in warmed and ambient plots using HOBO pendant temperature loggers (Onset Computer Corporation, Bourne, Massachusetts, USA) installed at the soil surface.
6: Over the course of the experiment, OTCs warmed plots by an average of 0.36C (95% CI [0.34, 0.37], paired  t test,  P < 0.001).
7: Prior work at this field site showed no significant effect of OTCs on soil moisture or snow depth (Zhang  2011).
