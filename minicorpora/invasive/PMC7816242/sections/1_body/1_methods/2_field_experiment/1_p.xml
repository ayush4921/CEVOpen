<p>We conducted a two‐cohort field experiment at the Russell E. Larson Agricultural Research Farm in Rock Springs, Pennsylvania, USA (latitude 40.71° N, longitude 77.94° W). The site was prepared before planting each cohort by applying a miller offset disk two times to kill aboveground vegetation and then applying a roller harrow to level the soil surface. This preparation mimicked the type of disturbance that promotes musk thistle establishment along roadsides and in pastures. Aboveground competition was suppressed by clipping all vegetation other than our focal thistles down to the soil surface weekly to avoid a possible interaction between temperature treatments and vegetative competition. We manipulated temperature using fiberglass cone open top chambers (OTCs) with basal diameter of 1.48 m constructed according to the International Tundra Experiment Manual (Molau and Mølgaard

Throughout the experiment, temperature was monitored in warmed and ambient plots using HOBO pendant temperature loggers (Onset Computer Corporation, Bourne, Massachusetts, USA) installed at the soil surface. Over the course of the experiment, OTCs warmed plots by an average of 0.36°C (95% CI [0.34, 0.37], paired
