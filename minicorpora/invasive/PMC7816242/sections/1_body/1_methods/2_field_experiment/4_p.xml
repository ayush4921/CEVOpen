<p>For both cohorts, germination was observed throughout the summer and fall seasons, and the first three germinating individuals were individually marked. Other seedlings were counted and removed as they appeared. Marked seedlings’ survival, longest leaf length, and number of leaves were monitored throughout the fall. In the spring, one surviving individual from each sub‐plot was randomly selected for continued observation, and the other rosettes within the area were removed to reduce crowding. We harvested bolting individuals as they senesced in late July. We counted the total number of capitula produced by each bolting individual, and we measured capitulum diameter to estimate seed production according to a known, strongly significant relationship (Marchetto et al.

In total, over the course of the experiment (2012–2016 for the first cohort, 2013–2016 for the second cohort), we recorded end‐of‐growing‐season data on 558 rosettes (207 from the first cohort and 351 from the second), 388 of which were thinned out in spring and 170 of which were left to continue growing. Over the course of the experiment we observed 138 bolting plants (51 from the first cohort and 87 from the second).
