0: We manipulated the phenology of seed release by planting mature seeds at seven different times throughout the fall growing season (see Appendix  S1: Table S1).
1: In each year of the experiment, seeds were collected on a single day in July prior to planting from >50 individual mother plants from a single naturally occurring population of musk thistle to the south of our experimental site in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, USA.
2: Seeds were extracted from flower heads, mixed together, and sifted to retain only ripened seeds.
3: We stored seeds in paper envelopes at room temperature until they were planted.
4: Carduus nutans germination is triggered by suitable microhabitat conditions (Hamrick and Lee  1987) and prior pilot studies in the Shea lab show that similar germination rates are generated by moisture over an extended period.
5: On each planting date, we scattered 100 seeds over an area of 10  15 cm and covered them with a dusting of soil that was lightly compressed to hold seeds in place and reduce removal by seed predators.
6: We also marked control plots with no seeds planted to track any background germination of thistles from the seed bank; background contamination was negligible (three seedlings over the whole experiment) and is not discussed further.
