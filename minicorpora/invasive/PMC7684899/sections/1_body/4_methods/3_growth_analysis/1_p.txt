0: Harvests for the growth analysis were performed at regular intervals each with five replicates of each species.
1: The plants were divided into leaves and roots.
2: Fresh and dry mass (after 4 days in the dry oven at 80 C) were recorded.
3: Leaf area was measured using a LI-COR Li-3000C leaf area meter (LI-COR Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA).
4: The dry material was ground to a fine powder using a mortar and pestle and analyzed for total C and N concentration by mass spectrometry (Isotope ratio mass spectrometer (DeltaV, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany; Elemental analyzer (Flash EA 2000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany)) as described by Werner et al.
5: [ 58].
6: The C:N ratio as well as the NUE (increase in dry weight per unit of nitrogen) was calculated.
7: RGR was calculated according to Lambers and Poorter [ 28]: \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$ {\text{RGR }} = {\text{ LAR}}\; \times \;{\text{NAR}} $$\end{document}RGR=LARNAR
