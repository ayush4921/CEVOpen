<p id="Par69">An estimate of each individual plant's daily carbon budget was obtained by converting net photosynthesis, respiration (in the dark) and root respiration rates to a per day basis according to the number of hours per day that each gas exchange parameter took place (NP 16 h, DR 8 h and RR 24 h). In order to reflect the whole plant budget, these rates were weighted according to the plants R:S ratio.</p>
