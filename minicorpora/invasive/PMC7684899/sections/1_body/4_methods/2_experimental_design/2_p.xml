<p id="Par63">The experiment consisted of 6 treatments for each species, in a 3 × 2 factorial design: three temperature conditions (7 °C (chilling), 20 °C (control) and 30 °C (warming)) and two nutrient conditions (free access and low access (50% reduced) nitrogen). Plants incubated at 20 °C were considered the control group because this temperature has been described to be optimal for grasses from steppe or meadow vegetation in Europe [

In the nitrogen limited (LA) treatments, the proportion of N in the stock solutions was reduced by 80% and nitrogen supply was adjusted manually on a daily basis using a 1 molar ammonium-nitrate stock solution, so that the N supply (as mg N/day) was reduced to 50% of that required by the seedlings for optimal growth. The supply of all the other nutrients remained unchanged.
