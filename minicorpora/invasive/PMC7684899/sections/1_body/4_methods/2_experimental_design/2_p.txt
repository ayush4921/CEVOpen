0: The experiment consisted of 6 treatments for each species, in a 3  2 factorial design: three temperature conditions (7 C (chilling), 20 C (control) and 30 C (warming)) and two nutrient conditions (free access and low access (50% reduced) nitrogen).
1: Plants incubated at 20 C were considered the control group because this temperature has been described to be optimal for grasses from steppe or meadow vegetation in Europe [ 30].
2: Under free access nitrogen (FA) treatments, the seedlings were supplied with mineral nutrients in a proportion that was known to be optimal for growth [ 24], with a nitrogen concentration that was low, but optimal (30  2 mg in 6 dm 3 solution, [ 25].
3: In the nitrogen limited (LA) treatments, the proportion of N in the stock solutions was reduced by 80% and nitrogen supply was adjusted manually on a daily basis using a 1 molar ammonium-nitrate stock solution, so that the N supply (as mg N/day) was reduced to 50% of that required by the seedlings for optimal growth.
4: The supply of all the other nutrients remained unchanged.
