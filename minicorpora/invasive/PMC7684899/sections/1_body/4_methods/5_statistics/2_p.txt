0: To evaluate the effects of temperature, nitrogen availability and their interaction with the dependent variables SLA, NP max, NUE and C:N ratio, we applied a univariate linear model.
1: Species (2 discrete levels:  B. erectus vs .
2: B. hordeaceus), temperature (3 discrete levels: 7 C, 20 C and 30 C) and nitrogen treatment (2 discrete levels: full access vs. low access) were treated as discrete explanatory variables.
3: We evaluated single effects as well as all two-way and three-way interactions.
4: T-tests were performed to compare between the species on selected groups.
