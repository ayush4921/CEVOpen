<p id="Par58">Finally, we posed the question of whether potential benefits of a more conservative life strategy in slow-growing plants through functional traits vanish when ecophysiological trait coordination is needed as well, in a combined stress scenario. Our results imply, that for the fast-growing invader 
 <italic>B. hordeaceus</italic> a reduction of nitrogen availability in combination with a temperature increase may indeed lead to a disadvantage in comparison to the slow-growing perennial species 
 <italic>B.erectus</italic> and this may explain why nutrient-rich habitats often experience more invasion than resource-poor habitats [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]
 <italic>.</italic> However, the absolute values of traits (such as RGR, SLA or NP
 <sub>max</sub>) were similar between fast-and slow-growing species when the plants where grown at suboptimal temperature and at low- nitrogen availability. This implies that any differentiation between the two growth strategies becomes difficult in such a scenario and a growth strategy convergence can occur as a result from combined stress effects.
