<p id="Par56">We can support our initial hypothesis that nitrogen limitation will limit growth performance independent of growth strategy because we saw that the 50% reduction of N-availability at optimal temperature decreased RGR to the same amount in both species. However, both species seem to use the same mechanism to achieve this (increasing NUE). A good nutrient acquisition capacity could be the result of low biomass density at least in the fast-growing grasses [

As an additional explanation it needs to be considered that although the nitrogen availability was reduced to 50% in the growth units, the nutrient availability was still higher than it would be within a nitrogen depletion scenario in natural conditions (such as found in a limestone grassland, [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, for our approach, the decision to reduce N by 50% displayed an experience-based trade-off between experimental handling (overall time of the plants in the growth units) and effect size, which was proven to be significant in most treatments.
