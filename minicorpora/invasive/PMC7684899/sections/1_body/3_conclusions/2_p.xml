 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. On a global basis, mean annual temperature has been shown to strongly correlate with plant traits [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] but slow‐ and fast‐growing species did not appear to differ in their plasticity of RGR in response to growth temperature [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Therefore, our second hypothesis handled the response of plant ecophysiological traits to changes in temperature and we were suggesting this to be independent of growth strategy (fast vs. slow). Our results support this hypothesis by showing that significant increases in carbon losses via both shoot and root respiration, a reduction of the root biomass and inflexible NAR values, were similar responses to changes in temperature in both species. Most prominent, in response to chilling, the unaltered carbon budget pattern as a result of a uniform reduction of the absolute rates carbon uptake and release rates (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), was uniform across species and growth strategy. Nevertheless, the effect size of these responses was consistently higher in the fast-growing 
 <italic>B. hordeaceus</italic> than it was in the slow-growing 
 <italic>B. erectus</italic> and this led to more drastic effects in RGR reduction in the fast-growing species. Accordingly, the fast-growing 
 <italic>B. hordeaceus</italic> showed a marked optimum at 20 °C growth temperature whilst 
 <italic>B. erectus</italic> did not.
