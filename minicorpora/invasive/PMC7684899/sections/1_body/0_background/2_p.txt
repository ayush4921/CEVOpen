0: Functional traits encapsulate the relative and overall constitutive adaptation of plants by revealing the strategies developed under evolutive forces.
1: Therefore, functional traits inform on the overall level of environmental stress in each environment.
2: The most prominent functional trait relevant to the plants carbon economics is the specific leaf area (SLA, defined as the amount of leaf area per unit leaf weight).
3: SLA is widely used as a proxy to predict a plants position on the resource use axis [ 60] and can be considered as the prime factor determining interspecific variation in relative growth rate (RGR, [ 28].
4: By definition, leaves with a lower SLA are denser (greater mass per volume) or thicker [ 46] and tend to invest more in structural leaf defences [ 9].
5: The reciprocal of SLA, the leaf mass per area (LMA) is also frequently used [ 28] as an indicator of plant function [ 16] and to position a species along an axis based on resources acquisition.
6: The root to shoot ratio (R:S) is a measure of allocation of biomass to roots in relation to aboveground biomass, and can be interpreted according to the optimal resource partitioning strategy.
