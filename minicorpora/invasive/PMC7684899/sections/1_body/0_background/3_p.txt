0: Fast growing species are characterized by having low LMA and high SLA and vice versa for slow growers.
1: For evaluation of a plants nutrient economy, functional traits like nitrogen and phosphorus content, the carbon to nitrogen ratio (C:N) ratio and the nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) are widely used.
2: Nitrogen concentrations are a common leaf and root trait syndrome that links traits to effects on whole plant processes [ 55].
3: The C:N ratio of an organ is often regarded as a convenient indicator of growth and quality, and can also be considered as a good indicator of secondary compound concentrations in all plant organs.
4: The NUE (increase in dry weight per unit of nitrogen) describes the efficiency of carbon incorporation into biomass [ 30].
