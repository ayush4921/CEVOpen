<p id="Par22">Functional traits encapsulate the relative and overall constitutive adaptation of plants by revealing the strategies developed under evolutive forces. Therefore, functional traits inform on the overall level of environmental stress in each environment. The most prominent functional trait relevant to the plant’s carbon economics is the specific leaf area (SLA, defined as the amount of leaf area per unit leaf weight). SLA is widely used as a proxy to predict a plants position on the resource use axis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] and can be considered as the prime factor determining interspecific variation in relative growth rate (RGR, [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. By definition, leaves with a lower SLA are denser (greater mass per volume) or thicker [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] and tend to invest more in structural leaf defences [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The reciprocal of SLA, the leaf mass per area (LMA) is also frequently used [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] as an indicator of plant function [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and to position a species along an axis based on resources acquisition. The root to shoot ratio (R:S) is a measure of allocation of biomass to roots in relation to aboveground biomass, and can be interpreted according to the “optimal resource partitioning strategy”.
