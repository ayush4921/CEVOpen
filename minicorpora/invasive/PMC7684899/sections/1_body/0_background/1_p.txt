0: The spread of fast-growing invasive alien species is one of the major threats to habitats and their species diversity with implications for plant community assembly in future climate change scenarios.
1: Invasive species may succeed even in low-resource environments by employing resource conservation traits such as high resource-use efficiency [ 18] and they are typically species located on the fast end of the productivitypersistence tradeoff axes [ 13].
2: The plant economics spectrum concept provides the theoretical framework to arrange plant species from the fast end of the productivitypersistence tradeoff axis to taxa with slow, conservative life traits.
3: It integrates across leaves, stems and roots and is a key feature helping to explain individual ecological traits, community assembly processes and the functioning of ecosystems [ 48].
4: According to Reich [ 48], a fast or a slow growth strategy each requires a particular set of leaf, root and stem traits.
5: Plants with a slow growth strategy will have low respiration rates, low nutrient concentrations, dense tissues, with low water movement and loss capacities across all plant tissues.
6: In contrast, fast-growing species are highly efficient in transporting water, in acquiring and using nutrients and in fixing carbon, but invest less in their tissues (whether root, stem, or leaf).
7: The plant individual performance results from the coordinated operation of many processes, such as nutrient uptake, organ turnover or photosynthesis, thus a prediction requires a certain set of traits.
8: A plants economy is determined by its handling/usage of three key resources: carbon, water, and mineral nutrients, and the most critical functional and eco-physiological traits relevant to these.
