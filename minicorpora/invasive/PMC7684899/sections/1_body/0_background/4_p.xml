<p id="Par24">Other than functional traits, ecophysiological traits condense acclimative processes in an individual plant and they can account for variations in flows of material and energy. The most prominent ecophysiological traits relevant to the plantâ€™s carbon economics are respiration (R) and net photosynthesis (NP, [

Products from photosynthesis account for approximately 90% of a plant`s dry weight, therefore the photosynthetic properties of a plant are the basis to understand any variation in growth. However, the daily carbon budget of a plant is also strongly influenced by respiration because approximately 50% of the fixed carbon is respired [
