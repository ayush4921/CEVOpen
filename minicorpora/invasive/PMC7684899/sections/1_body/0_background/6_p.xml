<p id="Par26">In the climate change context especially, stresses produced by a combination of temperature (both chilling and heat) and nutrient availability were identified as a white spot on the plants stress response matrix [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Consequently, we aim to help fill this knowledge gap, by testing the generality of trait relationships and analysing how shifts in temperature and nutrient stoichiometry influence plant functional and ecophysiological traits. The traits we study are considered as ‘hard’ traits, with a direct functional role such as carbon fixation, leaf instantaneous photosynthetic rate, nutrient uptake [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] or SLA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. We test a fast-growing, invasive, annual C
 <sub>3</sub> grass and a slow-growing perennial species. To differentiate the temperature and nutrient effects, we chose an experimental approach (aeroponic growth chambers) that allows maximum control and monitoring of conditions. We formulate three hypotheses in which trait based plant economics strategies are evaluated against changes in (i) nutrient availability and (ii) temperature individually, and in combination (iii).

   <p id="Par27">Nitrogen limitation will limit growth performance independent of growth strategy but via different routes. While slow growing species have evolved functional traits resulting in a more conservative life strategy that allows growth in low nutrient conditions, fast growing, invasive species will employ resource conservative ecophysiological traits in response to nutrient shortage.</p>

   <p id="Par28">Temperature affects the plant’s energy balance and metabolic rate. As a response, fast growing annual and slow growing perennial species will respond with similar changes in their ecophysiological trait coordination.</p>

   <p id="Par29">The individual effects of nutrient or temperature stress are additive when applied in combination. Potential benefits of a more conservative life strategy in slow-growing plants through functional traits vanish when ecophysiological trait coordination is needed as well.</p>
