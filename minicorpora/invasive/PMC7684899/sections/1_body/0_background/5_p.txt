0: The major outcome of the plant economics trait-based approach is to evaluate performance outcomes in ecologically relevant settings.
1: Many studies exist that test the variability of these traits in response to changes of one parameter, such as irradiance [ 4,  33], nutrient availability [ 1,  10,  54], water availability [ 35 37], and temperature/climate [ 41,  62].
2: Under natural conditions, plants are often exposed to complex stresses from several of these resources and the impact of combined effects has been examined under simultaneously varying nutrient and light availabilities [ 4,  22,  49] as well as nutrient and drought stress [ 51].
3: The response of plants to combinations of two or more stressors is unique and cannot be directly extrapolated from the response of plants to each stressor applied individually [ 53].
4: The simultaneous occurrence of different stressors results in a high degree of complexity in plant responses because the responses are largely controlled by different, and sometimes opposing, signalling pathways that may interact, both positively and negatively [ 53].
5: The question remains open whether the categorisation, implemented by the plant economics spectrum approach, remains valid when individuals of one species are exposed to different and combined effects of stress [ 11].
6: For example, it is shown that single-factor studies could be inadequate to forecast plant responses in a climate change scenario [ 38].
