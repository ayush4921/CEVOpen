0: Other than functional traits, ecophysiological traits condense acclimative processes in an individual plant and they can account for variations in flows of material and energy.
1: The most prominent ecophysiological traits relevant to the plants carbon economics are respiration (R) and net photosynthesis (NP, [ 48]).
2: Products from photosynthesis account for approximately 90% of a plant`s dry weight, therefore the photosynthetic properties of a plant are the basis to understand any variation in growth.
3: However, the daily carbon budget of a plant is also strongly influenced by respiration because approximately 50% of the fixed carbon is respired [ 44].
4: Respiration takes places in all plant organs and is therefore very important when whole plant carbon economics are to be understood.
