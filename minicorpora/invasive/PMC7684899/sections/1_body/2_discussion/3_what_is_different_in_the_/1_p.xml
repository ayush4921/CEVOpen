 <italic>B. erectus</italic>, 
 <italic>B. hordeaceus</italic> had a fast-grower’s life strategy and grew twice as fast, had doubled NP
 <sub>max</sub> and significantly higher SLA at 20 °C with FA conditions. This also displays the invasive character of 
 <italic>B. hordeaceus</italic>, because invasive alien species are known to have higher values for performance-related traits than non‐invasive species [
