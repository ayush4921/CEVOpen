<p id="Par54">The main difference was that 
 <italic>B. hordeaceus</italic> had a sharp maximum in RGR at 20 °C and could not shift to grow well at higher or lower temperatures. Although NAR, in general, was about 30% higher in 
 <italic>B. hordeaceus</italic> than in 
 <italic>B. erectus,</italic> the impossibility to adjust NAR in response to temperature resulted in a drastic decrease in RGR. When exposed to warm growing temperatures RGR was then similar to those of the slow growing 
 <italic>B. erectus</italic> and when exposed to cold temperatures RGR were even below those of 
 <italic>B. erectus</italic>.
