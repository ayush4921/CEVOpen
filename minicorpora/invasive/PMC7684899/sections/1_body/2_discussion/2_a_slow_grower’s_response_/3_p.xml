 <italic>.</italic> Now, RGR was generally reduced to around 65% of FA conditions and was even lower at both treatment temperatures (7 °C and 30 °C). The cold + low nitrogen treatment could be identified as the most limiting for 
 <italic>B.erectus,</italic> despite having adjusted so well under FA conditions. Neither the up-regulation of NAR, nor the down regulation of SLA demonstrated under FA conditions was realised, resulting in lower RGR most possibly linked to a limited potential to up regulate NUE (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b) under LA conditions. In order to compensate for the lower nutrient availability, the close functional coordination between root and shoot traits [
