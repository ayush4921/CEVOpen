<p id="Par52">In direct contrast, when 
 <italic>B. erectus</italic> was exposed to warming (30 °C) in combination with LA conditions, the growth was less affected and only slightly lower than under FA conditions. However, due to increased root and leaf dark respiration rates the amount of available carbon resources were at their lowest (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), and, to improve the efficiency of carbon incorporation into biomass, NUE was highest. As found at 7 °C under FA conditions, this process appears to be costly and results in high C:N ratios and also the highest R:S ratio, indicating a coordinated variation of root and shoot nitrogen content as well as SLA [

 <italic>B. erectus</italic>, this could reflect the species’ habitat specialisation, as 
 <italic>B. erectus’</italic> favoured habitat types are warm–nutrient-poor environments such as calcareous grasslands of the Mesobromion alliance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], of which it is a characteristic, name-giving species. In general, species with a slow-growing traits syndrome are more successful under low nutrient conditions [
