 <italic>B. erectus</italic> had almost identical RGR as at 20 °C (control conditions) due to a well-balanced adjustment of its functional traits. Because NAR and SLA are co-dependent in the calculation of RGR [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], for RGR to remain at levels similar to control conditions, the significant decrease in SLA involved a simultaneous increase in NAR (more than double to that of control conditions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c)). This indicates that, at low temperature, the net dry weight gain was converted to higher investments in leaf stability, making them thicker and more sustainable and agrees with the common response of plants when grown at low temperatures [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Surprisingly, growing in the cold also resulted in higher investments in root tissue, although root growth is usually known to be limited at temperatures ~ 6 °C (Alvarez‐Uria and Körner [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]). These results could be explained via a the following response cascade starting with the carbon uptake in the leaf: At 7 °C, due to a lack of thermal acclimation of net photosynthesis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), carbon uptake rates were much reduced (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). As a response to operating at such low, sub-optimal uptake rates, NUE was increased to enhance the efficiency of carbon incorporation into biomass (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). For the plant's growth economics, this is a costly process, which was displayed in a higher C:N ratio. The higher C:N ratio in the leaves can then be the trigger for the plant to allocate biomass investments towards the root in order to increase the surface tissue for nutrient uptake according to the “optimal resource partitioning strategy”. According to this model, plants respond to environmental factors that limit the acquisition of below-ground resources relative to above-ground resources by shifting their partitioning to tissues associated to gaining the relatively limiting resource [
