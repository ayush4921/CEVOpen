<p id="Par48">Our results indicate clear differences in trait coordination between a slow growing grass perennial and a fast growing, invasive competitor. Any fast acclimation to growth conditions via ecophysiological trait adjustments is costly, especially when low metabolic rates associated with low growth temperatures occur in combination with nutrient depletion. By having a set of well-conserved adaptive functional traits, slow-growing perennials might have benefits when handling such a combination of stressors.</p>
