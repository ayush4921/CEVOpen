 <italic>B. erectus</italic> and 
 <italic>B. hordeaceus</italic> showed a similar response pattern in the FA treatment. The R:S ratio was declining with increasing temperature from 7 °C to 20 °C (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>; F
 <sub>1,73</sub> = 3.13; p = 0.05), remaining constant at 30 °C. Under LA conditions, the R:S ratio was significantly increased in both species compared to FA conditions (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>; F
 <sub>1,72</sub> = 11.59; p = 0.002). In response to the combination of warming (30 °C) and low nitrogen availability the R:S ratio was higher for both species but more so, almost doubled, in the slow-growing 
 <italic>B. erectus</italic> (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).
