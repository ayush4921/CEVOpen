<p id="Par34">For both species, RGR were highest when plants were grown at 20° with FA conditions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a) but there were species-specific responses at other temperatures. The slow-growing 
 <italic>B. erectus</italic> maintained RGR at a high level at 7 °C and around 20% lower at 30 °C whilst the fast-growing 
 <italic>B. hordeaceus,</italic> showed a strong reduction (around 45%) at both 7 °C and 30 °C so that it had a very clear maximum at 20 °C (Table
