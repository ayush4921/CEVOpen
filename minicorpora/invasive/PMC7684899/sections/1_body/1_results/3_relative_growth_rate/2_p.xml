<p id="Par35">Under LA conditions, the slow-growing 
 <italic>B. erectus</italic> had similar RGR at all three treatment temperatures at around 65% of FA at 20 °C. In contrast, the fast-growing 
 <italic>B. hordeaceus</italic> again showed a maximum at 20 °C, although this was about 70% of the rate at FA. RGR at 7 °C and 30 °C were almost identical to rates for the slow-growing 
 <italic>B. erectus</italic> at those temperatures.
