<p id="Par38">In the FA treatment, the slow-growing 
 <italic>B. erectus</italic> had almost identical net assimilation rate (NAR) at 20 °C and 30 °C. At 7 °C NAR almost doubled (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). Rates for the fast-growing 
 <italic>B. hordeaceus</italic> were similar at all three temperatures and, in general, about 30% higher than for 
 <italic>B. erectus</italic>.
