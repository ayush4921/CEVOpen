<p id="Par30">Because of the multivariate nature and the various interactions, the results are structured to focus on the comparison between the species. Each parameter will be presented separately starting with the comparison of free access nitrogen (FA) for both species against temperature, followed by the low access nitrogen (LA) for both species against temperature.</p>
