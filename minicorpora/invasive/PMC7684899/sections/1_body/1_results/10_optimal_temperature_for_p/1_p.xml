<p id="Par45">Under FA conditions both species showed very similar responses in the temperature for optimal net photosynthesis, T
 <sub>opt</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). T
 <sub>opt</sub> was almost identical to growth temperature at 20 °C and 30 °C indicating that acclimation to these warmer growth temperatures was realised. However, acclimation was less obvious at 7 °C with T
 <sub>opt</sub> being more than twice as high as the growth temperature. Under low nitrogen delivery, this pattern remained similar for both species with the exception that T
 <sub>opt</sub> was closer to the actual growth temperature at 7 °C.
