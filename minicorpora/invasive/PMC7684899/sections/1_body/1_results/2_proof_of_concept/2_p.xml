<p id="Par32">At 20 °C, the fast-growth life strategy was validated for 
 <italic>B. hordeaceus</italic> because RGR and NP
 <sub>max</sub> were almost twice as high as for 
 <italic>B. erectus</italic> (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), C:N ratio was very low, and LMA significantly lower than for 
 <italic>B.erectus</italic> (T-test: t = 5.6, df = 8, p &lt; 0.005). The more conservative life traits were shown by 
 <italic>B. erectus</italic> supporting a slow-growth strategy in this species.
