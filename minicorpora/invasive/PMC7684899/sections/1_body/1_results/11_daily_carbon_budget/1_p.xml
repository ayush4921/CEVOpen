<p id="Par46">Under FA and at 20 °C, the fast-growing 
 <italic>B. hordeaceus</italic> lost only one-fourth of its daily available carbon via root and leaf dark respiration, while this was more than a half for the slow-growing 
 <italic>B.erectus</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). At 7 °C, this pattern remained almost identical in both species, but the total amount of available carbon (size of the circle) was much reduced in the fast-growing 
 <italic>B. hordeaceus</italic>, but remained almost identical for the slow-growing 
 <italic>B. erectus</italic>. At 30 °C total available carbon decreased and because total respiration losses increased in both species the available carbon fraction was cut to one-fourth (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).
