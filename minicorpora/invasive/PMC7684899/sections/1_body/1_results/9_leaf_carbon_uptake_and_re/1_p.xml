<p id="Par43">For both species, the uptake rates were highest when grown at 20 °C with those for the fast-growing 
 <italic>B. hordeaceus</italic> being twice as high as those for the slow-growing 
 <italic>B. erectus</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). Both chilling and warming reduced these rates, with NP
 <sub>max</sub> close to zero at 7 °C for both species but a smaller decline at 30 °C. Under LA conditions the response pattern for both species remained similar to that under FA conditions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a) but rates at 20 °C and 30 °C were lower than under FA.
