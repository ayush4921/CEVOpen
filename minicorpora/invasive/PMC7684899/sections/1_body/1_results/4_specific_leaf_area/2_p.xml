<p id="Par37">Under LA conditions the response patterns varied between the species. The slow-growing 
 <italic>B. erectus</italic> showed a reverse pattern to FA conditions with lowest SLA at 20 °C. SLA was very much higher at 7 °C and 350% higher than in the FA treatment;, and a similar level at 30 °C as under FA conditions. In complete contrast, the fast-growing 
 <italic>B. hordeaceus</italic> had an almost stable SLA with a small and steady decline (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).
