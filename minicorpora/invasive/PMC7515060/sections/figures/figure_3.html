 <caption> Maps showing current and future projected climatic suitability for 14 nationally important IAPS in Sri Lanka. ( a) Current climate; ( b) MIROC5 RCP 4.5 for 2050; ( c) MIROC5 RCP 4.5 for 2070; ( d) MIROC5 RCP 8.5 for 2050 and ( e) MIROC5 RCP 8.5 for 2070. Areas climatically suitable for a relatively higher number of IAPS are denoted by hot colors (red) while the areas relatively less suitable by the cooler colors (green). Color codes used to signify climatic suitability classes are equivalent across five maps and denote same numbers of predicted IAPS. </caption>
