<p>Western parts of Sri Lanka (particularly Colombo and Kalutara districts) are predicted to have very high suitability (7–8 IAPS) under current climate (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="entropy-21-00571-f003">Figure 3</xref>) which was relatively small and around 3% of the total land area of the country. According to climate projections, the suitability of this class is predicted to decrease in the future. This area loss could be mainly attributed by being converted into the moderate climate suitability by reduced suitability for one or two species, affecting the number of IAPS supported in the area. Similarly, the high climate suitability (5–6 IAPS) which accounts for approximately 13% of the total area of the country is predicted to decline and shift southward in the future. The moderate class (3–4 IAPS) is predicted to have significantly increased suitability under climate change. This area gain is predicted as an outward range expansion towards the coastal lowlands under both climate scenarios, but this expansion is severe under RCP 8.5. This increased suitability could be mainly attributed to the conversion of the very low and low suitability classes to the moderate class. This means more invasive species will have found this area suitable for establishment and spread in the future which is a concern in terms of invasiveness of the species considered.
