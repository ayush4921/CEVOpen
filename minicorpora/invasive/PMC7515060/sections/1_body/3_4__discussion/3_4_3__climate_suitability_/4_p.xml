<p>The analysis of area changes has revealed critical information relevant to the range dynamics of these IAPS. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="entropy-21-00571-f005">Figure 5</xref> confirms that both suitability expansions and contractions will simultaneously occur in all five classes (details in 
 <xref rid="entropy-21-00571-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>); though, it is expressed as an overall area increase or decrease in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="entropy-21-00571-f004">Figure 4</xref>. Those area losses and gains in the five classes are significantly high (&gt;10%) under both RCP scenarios, suggesting a high rate of invasion dynamics under the projected climate change. Therefore, our results suggest that the overall risk of plant invasion attributed by these 14 IAPS could be intensified in Sri Lanka in the future. However, the distribution we observe in the future may be smaller than the forecast distribution as species dispersal is restricted by many other factors i.e., geographical barriers, human influences.
