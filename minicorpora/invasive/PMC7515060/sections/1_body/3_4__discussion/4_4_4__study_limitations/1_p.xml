<p>We do understand the limitations of our model predictions of 14 IAPS that were used for defining climate suitability for multiple IAPS establishment. SDMs are basically underpinned on several assumptions, ecological concepts and theories [
 <xref rid="B16-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B78-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] and therefore uncertainty is a common issue associated with modeling techniques [
 <xref rid="B17-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In distribution studies, the selection of GCMs could influence the projections of species distributions under climate change as different GCMs simulate environmental variables differently [
 <xref rid="B17-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Performance of GCMs is difficult to evaluate and it may depend on variables used and the study region; thus, the use of multiple GCMs is often recommended in distribution modeling [
 <xref rid="B107-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. However, MIROC5 has been tested by previous empirical studies [
 <xref rid="B66-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,
 <xref rid="B108-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>,
 <xref rid="B109-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>,
 <xref rid="B110-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>] for South Asia and also widely used in recent modeling literature in that region [
 <xref rid="B49-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,
 <xref rid="B111-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>,
 <xref rid="B112-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. Single model uncertainty is also considered as an issue in predictive modeling. Studies have demonstrated that the variation in predictive performance among modeling techniques is significantly high and though the best model is applied it contributes uncertainty rather than other contributory factors, i.e., GCMs and RCPs [
 <xref rid="B113-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. Therefore, the use of a single model is increasingly criticized in SDM literature. Such uncertainty can be minimized through testing model performance across several modeling techniques and averaging them [
 <xref rid="B114-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. Therefore, multi-model approaches (i.e., Ensemble forecasting) are recommended for robust model predictions and also for cautious interpretation [
 <xref rid="B115-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. However, we used the well-established and widely recognized MaxEnt modeling technique as 
 <italic>it</italic> frequently outperforms other presence-
 <italic>only</italic> modeling algorithms [
 <xref rid="B46-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,
 <xref rid="B55-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,
 <xref rid="B116-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. Further, this modeling study was undertaken entirely on bioclimatic variables based on the fact that climate controls the geographical distribution of plants predominantly over the other non-climatic factors [
 <xref rid="B26-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and we did not use non-climatic variables (i.e., disturbance, biotic interactions) to test our models. However, according to a study by [
 <xref rid="B117-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>], non-climatic variables of ecophysiological importance also drive the distribution of plants and failure to consider the contribution of all potentially important variables in models can affect the model accuracy and predictive ability. Therefore, we acknowledge the possible limitations generated by the exclusion of non-climatic predictors. Imperfect detection is also a common issue in presence-background (i.e., MaxEnt) models which is generally difficult to overcome in modeling studies and thus overlooked [
 <xref rid="B118-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. Imperfect detection can have important implications in predictive modeling resulting in two fundamental-error types in predictions: False-negative errors, (non-detection) and false-positive errors (misclassification) [
 <xref rid="B119-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>,
 <xref rid="B120-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. Therefore, it violates one of the fundamental assumptions of distribution modeling which is species are detected equally across the study site [
 <xref rid="B121-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. We used presence-only observed occurrences in our models which lack information on certain sites (i.e., unsampled, inaccessible, not yet occupied). Using MaxEnt as an example, a study by [
 <xref rid="B118-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>] has shown that imperfect detection influence on model discrimination of presenceâ€“background techniques. This issue may potentially lead to incorrect performance of distribution models and thus influence conservation decision making especially under potential climate change [
 <xref rid="B16-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B122-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>,
 <xref rid="B123-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. However, presence-only data (e.g., herbarium data) are commonly used when absence data are not available especially in less intensively sampled tropical countries [
 <xref rid="B21-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Spatial predictions of modeling illustrate a species or habitat distribution in the geographical space rather than the ecological niche of species that exists in the environmental space [
 <xref rid="B16-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Though interpreted by different names (i.e., habitat modeling, ecological niche modeling), all SDMs identify suitable habitat to support a species to survive and reproduce; however, this is not identical to ecological niche modeling [
