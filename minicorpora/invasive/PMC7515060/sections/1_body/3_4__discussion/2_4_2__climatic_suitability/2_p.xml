<p>In literature, many IAPS are projected to have increased potential area of suitability under changing climate [
 <xref rid="B95-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Climate change can increase species invasion primarily by two processes (i) shifting propagules of invasive plants to a new location, (ii) deteriorating the resistance that native plants naturally possess against the establishment of invasive plants [
 <xref rid="B96-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. However, many distribution models have also predicted decreased suitability of invasive plants under projected climate change [
 <xref rid="B95-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>,
 <xref rid="B97-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>,
 <xref rid="B98-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>,
 <xref rid="B99-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Literature shows the increased potential distribution of invasive plants in some countries in the future and decreasing trend of the same species in some other countries under projected climate change [
 <xref rid="B100-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>,
 <xref rid="B101-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. For instance, a study by [
 <xref rid="B102-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>] used SDMs to model the potential climate suitability of six aggressive IAPS (
 <italic>Ageratum houstonianum</italic>, 
 <italic>Chromolaena odorata</italic>, 
 <italic>Hyptis suaveolens</italic>, 
 <italic>Lantana camara</italic>, 
 <italic>Mikania micrantha</italic> and 
 <italic>Parthenium hysterophorus</italic> across Nepal and found that these species will expand in the future. Likewise, a study by [
 <xref rid="B49-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] evaluated the ecological niches of five troublesome IAPS in the Himalyan foothills to examine the invasive potential of these species. This study revealed that some invasive plants (
 <italic>Ageratum conyzoides</italic> and 
 <italic>Parthenium hysterophorus</italic>) will show more conservative behavior in the novel climate while some other species (
 <italic>Ageratina adenophora</italic>, 
 <italic>Chromolaena odorata</italic> and 
 <italic>Lantana camara</italic>) will increase their spread. Decreased potential climate suitability for some IAPS implies that the relative ability to tolerate or cope with the climate change is low in those species; though invasive species show adaptations to thrive harsh environmental conditions [
 <xref rid="B103-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Again, species invasion involves associations not only between invading species and the environment but also with other associated species too [
 <xref rid="B104-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. Therefore, this is considered as a complex phenomenon of several facets. Under the given high ecological and environmental tolerance, why some invasive species reduce their overall climate suitability in the future is not fully understood and adequately studied [
 <xref rid="B49-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. It could be partly explained by species-level invasive characteristics that are not shared among all invaders alike and strictly depends on the relationship between conditions of the environment and the individual species [
 <xref rid="B104-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. This means that the potential responses of invasive plants to climate change is different, inconsistent and needs to be studied to generate the most critical information for the strategic management of IAPS.
