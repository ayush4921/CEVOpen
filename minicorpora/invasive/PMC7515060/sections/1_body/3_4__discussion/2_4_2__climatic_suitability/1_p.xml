<p>In general, out of the 14 IAPS examined, seven species are projected to have increased climate suitability while the other seven species are projected to have decreased suitability. The projected climate suitability and the predicted changes are not uniform among the IAPS. A wide variation could be expected in terms of the rate of area changes and the pattern of potential suitability shift of the individual species (

 <italic>O. dillenii</italic> is predicted to increase up to 4-fold by 2050 under both emission scenarios compared to the current climate. In other words, approximately half of the countryâ€™s total area (mainly dry lowlands) is predicted as suitable for 
 <italic>O. dillenii</italic> invasion in the future. 
 <italic>P. histerophorus</italic> is also predicted to have increased suitability (approximately 40% of the total area of the country) by 2050 in the north and east where many agricultural lands are located. The statistics under both scenarios indicates that 
 <italic>U. europaeus</italic> could disappear from Sri Lanka by 2050.
