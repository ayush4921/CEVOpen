0: Thus, the maximum training sensitivity plus specificity logistic threshold of MaxEnt was used with the average model output to develop binary presence-absence maps for each species.
1: The reclassify tool of the ArcMap was used to develop presence-absence maps with suitable areas above the threshold and not suitable areas below.
2: The suitable area prediction of each species was individually examined and assessed with the ecology of the species for verification.
3: The range size of each species was calculated using the field calculator by multiplying the number of cells of presence by the cell size.
4: All classified 14 layers were summed up to develop a combined raster using the raster calculator tool of the spatial analyst toolbox.
5: The combined raster layer (climatic heat map combining climatic suitability of 14 IAPS) was further classified into five classes in ArcMap (manual classification).
6: The maximum number of layers that overlapped at any one place was 8; thus, we set five classes as: very low (0 IAPS), low (12 IAPS), moderate (34 IAPS) high (56 IAPS) and very high (78 IAPS).
7: The very high class consisted of the highest (78) number of IAPS overlapped while the very low category is predicted as free from IAPS.
8: The same exercise was carried out with the average model result of individual species for future climate, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 for 2050 and 2070.
9: The five classes used for classifying the combined raster of current climate were used for classifying the combined rasters in the future climate as well.
10: Therefore, we developed 5 maps combining climatic suitability of 14 IAPS under current and future climate.
