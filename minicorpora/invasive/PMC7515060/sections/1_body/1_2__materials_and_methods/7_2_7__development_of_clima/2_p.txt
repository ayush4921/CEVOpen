0: By 2050 and 2070, the areas of suitability changes were calculated for 5 classes and 14 species, under both RCP scenarios.
1: The potential suitability of each class was further analyzed under three categories to identify the areas of contraction (area loss), expansion (area gain) and unchanged (the area not changed) and those calculations were also done by 2050 and 2070 under both scenarios.
2: Area of suitability changes of 14 individual species and 5 classified classes were calculated as a percentage of the proportion of area increase in relation to the original area of the species/class ((original area  new area/original area) * 100).
3: Therefore, area reductions were expressed as negative values.
4: Further, changes in the area of suitability in three area change categories (i.e., contraction, expansion and unchanged) were calculated as a percentage of the proportion of the area of each category in relation to the original area of the respective suitability class ((area of category/original area of the respective class) * 100).
