0: We decided to undertake modeling exclusively on climate data due to the following reasons (i) climate provides good prediction over the distribution of invasive species and most other variables (i.e., elevation) are proxy variables for climate; (ii) studies have successfully verified a similarity between the climatic conditions of the ecological habitat and the pattern of spread of invasive species [ 33, 63]; and iii) categorical variables are less compatible with continuous variables in MaxEnt model [ 64].
1: Therefore, we selected Worldclim (version 1.4), 19 bioclimatic variables at a resolution of 30 arc-seconds (~1 km 2) for current (representative of 19601990) and future [ 65] ( http://www.worldclim.org).
2: These variables have the capacity to determine the spatial limits of climatic tolerance of the species and hence widely used for species distribution modeling studies.
