0: For future projections, we used an improved fifth version of the atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (GCM), Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC).
1: These data were downloaded from the Worldclim website.
2: MIROC5, which was used for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), is an important tool with significantly improved climatological features for better performance of climate change simulations [ 30, 66] particularly in the South Asian region [ 49].
3: We selected RCPs (Representative Concentration Pathways) 4.5 and RCP 8.5 greenhouse gas concentration trajectories for 2050 and 2070.
4: RCP 4.5 (emissions peaks around 2040 and then decline) provides the intermediate scenario of greenhouse gas emissions, atmospheric concentrations, air pollutant emissions and land use changes in the future while RCP 8.5 (emissions rapidly rise until 2100) provides a very high scenario [ 23].
