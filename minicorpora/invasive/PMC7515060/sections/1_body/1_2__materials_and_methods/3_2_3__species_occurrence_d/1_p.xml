<p>In 2015 the Government of Sri Lanka identified 20 IAPS of national significance based on the criteria developed through a wider participatory and consultative process [
 <xref rid="B53-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. This list includes 16 terrestrial IAPS. The present study modeled only 14 IAPS (
 <xref rid="entropy-21-00571-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) out of the 16 terrestrial IAPS included in the national list of invasive plants of Sri Lanka (2 species were excluded due to the inadequacy of data on occurrences). We did not consider aquatic IAPS as modeling aquatic plants is relatively difficult and not common, perhaps due to the complexity of the interaction of environmental factors [
 <xref rid="B54-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] that influence growth and spread of aquatic plants. Geo-referenced occurrence records were obtained from either published or grey literature for the 14 evaluated species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="entropy-21-00571-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Most of the records in databases do not contain the sampling year(s) of occurrence data collected; however, these records approximately represent the period 1960–2015. MaxEnt models are underpinned on the assumption that all locations (more importantly in the environmental space) are uniformly sampled [
 <xref rid="B55-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Therefore, all occurrences were filtered at 30 s (0.0083°) grid cell to remove the spatial sampling bias and thus to improve model performance [

 <xref rid="B57-entropy-21-00571" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Spatial filtering reduced the total occurrences of 14 species to 1460, resulting in one occurrence for each grid cell in the areas where occurrences are spatially distributed.
