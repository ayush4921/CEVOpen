0: We used MaxEnt or the Maximum entropy species distribution modeling [ 21] which is one of the most popular [ 38] and globally accepted correlative modeling technique currently in use for predicting the potential distribution of species [ 44, 45].
1: MaxEnt predicts potential areas of suitability of species better than many other well-established species distribution methods using presence-only occurrence data, environmental variables and background records across the defined geographic area [ 46].
2: MaxEnt is underpinned on the maximum entropy (i.e., meaning most spread out or closest to uniform distribution) principle [ 21].
3: While running the model, MaxEnt estimates the probability distribution of maximum entropy of environmental variables across the entire study area which is represented by a number of grid cells [ 44, 47] and the species niche is defined relevant to these variables or features.
4: MaxEnt has been used in many applications in conservation science today, particularly on invasive species [ 48].
5: For instance, MaxEnt has been widely used to model the ecological niches of invasive species to predict areas where an invasive species could potentially occur in the future [ 49, 50].
6: The focus of these studies is to examine the potential distribution of selected species to classify areas for future strategic management.
7: Other popular applications of MaxEnt are reserve planning, identify critical habitats for threatened and endangered species, ecological risk assessment, species translocation, climate change impacts [ 21, 30, 51, 52].
