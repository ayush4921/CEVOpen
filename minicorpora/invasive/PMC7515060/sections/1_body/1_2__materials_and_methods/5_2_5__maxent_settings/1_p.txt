0: We used MaxEnt version 3.4.1 [ 73] ( http://biodiversityinformatics.amnh.org/open_source/maxent/) for the current modeling study.
1: Selection of MaxEnt approach was based on several well-known reasons (i) MaxEnt is relatively more robust over the other methods for small sample sizes [ 51, 74, 75, 76]; (ii) MaxEnt is resistant to spatial errors in occurrence data up to a certain extent [ 51] and performs well with occurrences that show sampling bias [ 77]; (iii) MaxEnt is more popular for predicting potential ranges of invasive plants [ 21, 55] and previously used for defining invasive plant hotspots [ 63, 71]; (vi) generally, simple models are more applicable for modeling IAPS and MaxEnt settings can be changed to make the model smoother (i.e., feature types) [ 78] and (vii) MaxEnt generates a continuous output, facilitating distinct binary predictions which is imperative in IAPS modeling [ 21, 75].
2: Logistic output, which is depicted by a linear scale of values ranging from 0 to 1, was selected for easy interpretation of results [ 35].
3: Background records (10,000) were used across the country as several species are used and the distribution of them in the landscape is not correctly known [ 55].
4: Cross-validation was employed with 10 replicates as we had relatively smaller sample sizes for some species.
5: This enables MaxEnt to use all data efficiently in model fitting and to receive a more realistic average output.
6: Concurrently, it helps to evaluate the model uncertainty [ 55].
7: However, we understand that lack of validation of the independent dataset can cause biased predictions generated by unknown overfitting [ 79, 80].
8: We also used 1000 maximum iterations in our models, enabling the algorithm to get close to convergence for a realistic prediction [ 21].
9: Linear, quadratic and hinge features were used since sample sizes were relatively low.
10: All other default values of user-specified parameters of MaxEnt relating to model construction were used as species-specific model tuning is difficult in multiple species modeling [ 21, 55, 64].
11: Models were run individually for 14 IAPS and the average fitted models were projected to the future climate scenarios.
12: The niche distribution of each individual species was examined in ArcMap (version 10.4.1) for further analysis.
