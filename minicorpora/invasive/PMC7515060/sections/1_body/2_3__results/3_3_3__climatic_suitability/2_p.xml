 <xref rid="entropy-21-00571-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> illustrate the projected changes of the five IAPS suitability classes in terms of relative range expansion (gain), contraction (loss) and unchanged (stable) under climate change. In the very high suitability class, the projected range contractions are prominent (100%) under both RCP scenarios by 2050 compared to the current climate. These area contractions are predicted in the western part of the country in Colombo and Kalutara districts. However, under RCP 4.5, the very high suitability class shows a high gain by 2070 compared to 2050 (358%). Unchanged areas in the very high suitability class are predicted as substantially small. Also, the losses and gains in the high suitability class are predicted as significant and scattered in the central highlands, western to southern parts of the country; though a substantial area in the southern coastal lowlands shows unchanged suitability. The moderate class clearly displays more area gain than area loss which is prominent by 2050 than later. This class is projected to gain significant area in the coastal lowlands of the country while losing relatively a small area in the central parts and more downward to the south. In the low and moderate suitability classes, both area gains and losses are substantially high (&gt;50%) by 2050 under both RCP scenarios. Very low class is predicted to contract in the future under both RCP scenarios. It should be noted that the area losses in this class were high compared to area gains and unchanged under both scenarios.
