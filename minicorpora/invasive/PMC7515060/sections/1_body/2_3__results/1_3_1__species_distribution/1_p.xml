<p>The predictive performances of evaluated IAPS were acceptable based on the quantitative assessments of model performance, AUC and TSS statistics (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-entropy-21-00571">Supplementary material S2</xref>). The mean AUC values of the 14 IAPS ranged from 0.788 (lowest) to 0.995 (highest) with an average of 0.922 (±0.06). Eleven IAPS out of 14 had AUC values &gt; 0.9. The average TSS values of the 14 IAPS ranged from 0.456 (lowest) to 0.896 (highest) with an average of 0.7046 (±0.04). Four IAPS had TSS &gt;0.8. We analyzed the relative contribution of predictor variables to the individual IAPS models. Three precipitation variables (precipitation of driest month, annual precipitation and precipitation seasonality) and two temperature variables (minimum temperature of coldest month and mean temperature diurnal range) appeared to be highly contributing to climatic suitability (
