0: Scientists believe that global warming and associated observed changes (i.e., sea level rise, floods, saltwater intrusion) are undeniable and can make a significant impact on life on earth, the sustainability of biodiversity and ecosystem processes [ 10].
1: According to IPCC [ 23] medium to high emission scenarios can cause sudden, high impact, irreversible damages to the ecosystem composition, structure and function.
2: Global climate change influences the spatial distribution of many plants in the geographic space [ 30, 31].
3: When climate change happens, species that are vulnerable and unable to shift their ranges for survival can become extinct from the habitat [ 23].
4: Stress conditions created by climate change can open more favorable habitats for invasive plants [ 10] as they can survive in a broader range of climate conditions due to their wide environmental tolerance [ 32].
