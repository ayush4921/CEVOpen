0: The species response to climate has been successfully used for the development of a number of species distribution models (SDMs) to assess the relative suitability of habitats for species [ 33].
1: SDMs predict species fundamental ecological niche or the area occupied by the species in the absence of interactions between living organisms [ 34].
2: The geographic distribution of species is constrained by several factors such as biotic interactions, dispersal ability, evolutionary history, geographical obstacles or human influences [ 21, 35].
3: Thus, the species cannot occupy the entire fundamental niche though the climate is suitable and therefore the fundamental niche is generally larger than the realized niche that the species actually occupies [ 36].
4: This explains that the prediction can be mostly an over-prediction of the area than the species can establish and spread.
5: SDMs can be projected under changing climate to different geographical areas or time periods to forecast the potential area of spread or assess invasion risk of a species [ 21].
6: Relevant to native species, SDMs can be used to assess potentially vulnerable species and sites under climate change [ 37].
7: This has made SDMs more important in applied ecology to understand species response in the current and future climate [ 38] to develop effective and appropriate strategies for conservation and management.
8: A large number of studies use SDMs to predict potential areas of distribution.
9: Literature shows the importance of updated climate change projections using multiple scenarios as many distribution studies are based on older versions of climate change projections and a significant number of them cover only one climate change scenario [ 39].
