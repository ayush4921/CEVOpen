0: Species invasion has been recognized as an agent of global change that has the potential to make large impacts on biodiversity and associated ecological processes [ 1].
1: It is considered as a serious threat to biodiversity, second only to habitat fragmentation and degradation [ 2].
2: Invasive species can have interactions with other drivers of global change and make complex and combined effects [ 3].
3: The threat will be intensified in the future allowing more than 17% of lands vulnerable to species invasion globally [ 4].
4: The species diversity on Earth is diminishing due to the introduction of invasive species to new ranges, which is increasing and already beyond the accepted level [ 5].
5: This is a common problem everywhere in the world, continents, oceanic islands, temperate and tropical regions [ 6].
6: The problem is severe in oceanic islands where the species and ecosystems are unique and vulnerable to external impacts [ 7, 8].
7: Moreover, species invasions can have negative impacts across several sectors other than biodiversity, such as agriculture, tourism, forestry, fishery, human health, water and irrigation.
8: The ultimate impacts can be interconnected [ 9], resulting in an utmost threat to the economy, social and environmental stability and sustainability of the planet [ 10].
