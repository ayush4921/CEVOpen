0: Warming of the earths surface has increased significantly and it will continue to warm.
1: The global mean surface temperature will increase significantly by the end of this century (20812100) compared to the current period (19862005) under different greenhouse gas emission scenarios [ 23].
2: Accordingly, this temperature increase can range from a minimum of 0.3 C (under RCP2.6) to a maximum of 4.8 C (under RCP8.5).
3: Temperature and precipitation have been reported to be the key factors determining the vegetation dynamics [ 24].
4: Climatic variables which are derivatives of meteorological data (i.e., temperature and precipitation) should result in a clear relationship with the spatial distribution of plants [ 25].
5: As the key determinant of species distribution, climate controls the geographical distribution of plants predominantly over the other non-climatic factors [ 26].
6: Climate models based on the bioclimate envelope rely on climatic variables and do not consider the non-climatic variables (i.e., soil type) [ 27].
7: However, the contribution of ecologically meaningful non-climatic variables (i.e., soil, elevation, and slope) and biotic factors (i.e., competition, predation, and pollination) has been frequently discussed in predictive modeling literature [ 28, 29].
