0: We examined the climatic suitability for multiple IAPS establishment and potential invasion dynamics in tropical island settings under climate change using Sri Lanka as an example.
1: Like many tropical islands, Sri Lanka is rich in biodiversity with high conservation values which is at risk by plant invaders.
2: The aims of present study were to (i) identify the potential climate suitability for multiple IAPS establishment under the current climate; (ii) predict potential changes by 2050 and 2070 under two climate change scenarios; (iii) classify climate suitability of the country and examine potential invasion dynamics under climate change.
3: We modeled 14 IAPS which are at different stages of invasion using MaxEnt niche model.
4: More specifically we identified the areas susceptible to multiple IAPS establishment and how will this susceptibility change under the projected climate change.
5: Our study is significant due to two important reasons.
6: Firstly, this study focused on the multi-species projection which had been the focus of a limited number of modeling studies.
7: Secondly, hitherto no comprehensive study has been done to forecast the potential distribution of IAPS under projected climate change in tropical island countries in the region with similar bioclimatic conditions.
8: Defining climatic suitability for multiple IAPS invasion is important for their successful control and management.
