0: The invasive plant,  Alliaria petiolata, can directly suppress native plants via competition ( Barto and Cipollini 2009), but here we focus on potential effects via leaf litter ( Fig.
1: 1).
2: The leaf litter of  Alliaria petiolata is known to have strong negative effects on native plants, through the production of glucosinolate and flavonoid allelochemicals ( Hale and Kalisz 2012) and changes in nutrient cycling ( Rodgers   et al.
3: 2008 ).
4: Alliaria petiolata leaf litter and its chemical leachates can have direct phytotoxic effects on native plants ( Fig.
5: 1, arrow 1) ( Cipollini   et al.
6: 2012 ).
7: In addition,  Alliaria petiolata is known to suppress arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) ( Fig.
8: 1, arrow 2) ( Hale and Kalisz 2012;  Cantor   et al.
9: 2011 ;  Hale   et al.
10: 2016 ) and ectomycorrhizal fungi ( Wolfe   et al.
11: 2008 ), which help plants acquire nutrients from the soil ( Mohammadi   et al.
12: 2011 ).
13: When  Alliaria petiolata allelochemicals kill AMF mutualists, this lowers photosynthetic rates in the native plant  Maianthemum racemosum ( Hale   et al.
14: 2011 ,  2016).
15: Isolating effects of allelochemicals is methodologically complex and at times controversial ( Lau   et al.
16: 2008 ;  Weisshuhn and Prati 2009).
17: For example, activated carbon is often used in allelopathy studies to absorb allelochemicals ( Callaway and Aschehoug 2000;  Prati and Bossdorf 2004), but has multiple effects on the soil, increasing the availability of some nutrients (e.g.
18: nitrate) and decreasing others (e.g.
19: ammonium) ( Lau   et al.
20: 2008 ).
21: While this method cannot by itself determine whether allelopathy occurs, it does change the context of the soil, allowing us to ask whether soil context might influence  Alliaria petiolata leaf litter effects.
22: Alliaria petiolata leaf litter can also alter nutrient cycling ( Fig.
23: 1, arrow 3) ( Rodgers   et al.
24: 2008 ), potentially increasing nutrient availability to native plants.
