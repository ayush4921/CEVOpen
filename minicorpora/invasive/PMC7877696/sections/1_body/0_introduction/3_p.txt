0: Lumbricus terrestris is an invasive earthworm ( Eisenhauer   et al.
1: 2007 ), which is likely to interact with  Alliaria petiolata, because it feeds by pulling leaf litter down into the soil ( Zicsi   et al.
2: 2011 ).
3: Lumbricus terrestris feeding behaviour may break down nutrients in leaves faster than decomposition alone, altering nutrient cycling ( Fig.
4: 1, arrow 4) ( Costello and Lamberti 2009).
5: Both  Lumbricus terrestris and  Alliaria petiolata are native to Europe and were introduced to the USA through European settlers in the 1800s ( Nuzzo 1993;  Eisenhauer   et al.
6: 2007 ) and have become widespread problems throughout much of the Eastern USA, where they often co-occur ( Nuzzo   et al.
7: 2009 ;  Zelles 2012).
8: A meta-analysis has indicated that greater invasive earthworm biomass correlates with greater invasive plant cover, consistent with invasive earthworms facilitating invasive plants ( Craven   et al.
9: 2017 ).
10: Because of this high degree of co-occurrence, we propose that  Lumbricus terrestris earthworms may amplify the effects of  Alliaria petiolata allelopathy through their feeding mechanism of pulling litter into underground burrows.
11: Lumbricus terrestris might thus increase the distribution of leaf litter over the roots of native plants, and thus increase the negative allelopathic effects of  Alliaria petiolata ( Fig.
12: 1, arrow 5).
