0: Assessment of effects of invaders have generally focussed on single invasive species, despite the frequent observation of systems with multiple invaders ( Kuebbing and Nunez 2015).
1: Interactions between multiple invaders could be additive (e.g.
2: Milton   et al.
3: 2007 ;  Cushman and Gaffney 2010;  Shaben and Myers 2010;  Braga   et al.
4: 2019 ), sub-additive ( Yang   et al.
5: 2011 ) or super-additive ( Green   et al.
6: 2011 ) and mostly focus on plantplant interactions ( Kuebbing and Nunez 2015).
7: We propose that invasive earthworms, like  Lumbricus terrestris (Lumbricidae), might interact with invasive plants because of their feeding mode of pulling leaf litter down into the soil ( Edwards 2004;  Fahey   et al.
8: 2013 ), potentially redistributing allelochemicals and nutrients produced by invasive plant leaf litter ( Fig.
9: 1).
10: For example,  Alliaria petiolata leaf litter produces allelochemicals that suppress plant mutualists belowground ( Cantor   et al.
11: 2011 ).
12: Invader interactions belowground might particularly influence plant physiology, because photosynthetic rates are limited by phosphorus availability ( Rychter and Rao 2005), and phosphorus uptake is mediated by arbuscular mycorrhizal mutualists in many cases.
13: Photosynthetic rates are also limited by nitrogen availability, which is a component of RuBisCO, the enzyme that fixes carbon in C 3 plants ( von Caemmerer and Quick 2000).
14: By partnering field and experimental data, we explore this potential interaction between invasive earthworms and  Alliaria petiolata leaf litter under realistic field conditions, as well as characterizing physiological mechanisms in a manipulative experiment.
