 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> has any direct effects on abundance in the field (
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Davis 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2015
 </xref>). Contrary to some previous work (
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Davis 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2015
 </xref>), we find a strong negative effect of 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> presence on native 
 <italic>Podophyllum peltatum</italic> abundance in the field, when soil nitrogen levels are low, consistent with either competition or allelopathy (
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Cipollini and Cipollini 2016</xref>). Our results are consistent with studies of the demography of native plant 
 <italic>Trillium erectum</italic>, whose population growth rate is suppressed by 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> in the field (
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Bialic-Murphy 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2020
 </xref>). Generally, more work is needed to disentangle direct and indirect effects of invaders like 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> on native plants (
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Cipollini and Cipollini 2016</xref>). Our work contributes to this line of research by suggesting that soil nutrient-mediated effects may be as or more important than allelopathy, at least for this native plant (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), and that these effects can occur even in the absence of AMF mutualists and may depend on nutrient availability in the soil.
