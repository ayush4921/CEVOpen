<p>Greater nutrient cycling by invasive earthworms like 
 <italic>Lumbricus terrestris</italic> (
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Costello and Lamberti 2009</xref>) combined with 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> leaves (
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Rodgers 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2008
 </xref>), harms the native plant 
 <italic>Podophyllum peltatum</italic> in the absence of AMF, at least under some soil conditions. Additional experiments with non-
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> leaf litter controls might help distinguish between allelopathy and nutrient effects as mechanisms (

 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Hale 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2011
 </xref>). While our observational data in the field suggests that these two invaders might not be interacting currently to suppress 
 <italic>Podophyllum peltatum</italic> cover, our experiment suggests that such interactions are likely, given sufficient stress on native plants. As environmental stressors, such as nutrient deposition (
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Fowler 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2013
 </xref>) and climate change (
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">IPCC 2014</xref>), increase, the potential for such negative super-additive effects between invaders may also increase (
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Mooney and Hobbs 2000</xref>). We suggest that field experiments that manipulate multiple stressors simultaneously, including nutrient deposition and multiple invaders, are needed to fully understand multi-invader interactions and their context-dependence. Our data suggests that even plants with positive physiological responses, like increased CO
 <sub>2</sub> drawdown in the leaf with increased nitrogen availability, are not able to compensate for the harm caused by multiple invaders.
