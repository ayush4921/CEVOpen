<p>Both our experiment and field observational data show that changes in nutrient acquisition or soil conditions can influence the strength or presence of the interaction between these invaders. While adding activated carbon to our experiment was intended to neutralize allelochemicals from 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic>, effects of activated carbon on soil nutrient availability and plant performance are complex (
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Lau 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2008
 </xref>), and activated carbon may have acted as an additional stressor to the native plantâ€”e.g. through reduced ammonium availability (
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Lau 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2008
 </xref>) or changes to the soil microbial community (
 <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">Weisshuhn and Prati 2009</xref>). Too much nitrogen can lead to excess leaf production at the cost of root production, leaving plants vulnerable to drought (
 <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">Templer 2013</xref>). Stress caused by activated carbon in this experiment may have caused 
 <italic>Podophyllum peltatum</italic> to be more vulnerable to the harmful effects of the worms and 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic>, which resulted in reduced 
 <italic>Podophyllum peltatum</italic> biomass; however, the mechanisms that govern this effect are unknown. In the field study, both earthworms and 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> were a significant function of soil nutrients. This suggests that significant decreases in 
 <italic>Podophyllum peltatum</italic> cover or biomass due to earthworm and 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> invasion may be context-dependent and influenced by nutrient availability within the soil.
