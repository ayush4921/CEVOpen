<p>In order to assess the photosynthetic rate of 
 <italic>Podophyllum peltatum</italic> across experimental treatments, we used an LI-6400XT portable photosynthesis system. Ambient conditions were mostly sunny with an average photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 1500 µmol m
 <sup>−2</sup> s
 <sup>−1</sup> and air temperature of ≈21 °C. Conditions within the chamber were maintained at a flow rate of 400 μmol s
 <sup>−1</sup>, a CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentration of 400 μmol mol
 <sup>−1</sup>, a leaf temperature of 21.4 °C, and between 40 and 50 % relative humidity. PPFD was set to 1200 μmol m
 <sup>−2</sup> s
 <sup>−1</sup> for all individuals measured. Based on previous data (not presented), this light level represented saturation for plants without inducing photoinhibition. Once plants stabilized in the chamber we logged 3 data points per plant on 23 May 2015 between 11:00 AM and 1:00 PM before rates began to lose stability.
