0: To determine AMF colonization, we stained roots collected from the  Podophyllum peltatum plants at the end of the experiment.
1: This procedure followed root staining protocol put forth by McGonigle and colleagues where roots were cleared for 20 min at 121 C in a 10 % KOH solution, and stained in Chlorazol Black E ( McGonigle   et al.
2: 1990 ).
3: Following staining we examined the stained roots under a microscope [digital camera (Model #C-3040; Olympus America Inc., Melville, NY, USA) attached to a microscope (Model #BH-2; Olympus Corporation, Lake Success, NY, USA)] at 40 and 100 magnification.
4: We found few traces of any AMF colonization on any of the 47 roots examined (one plant died before the end of the experiment).
5: Seven out of 47 pots had some signs of colonization and there was no apparent pattern with respect to treatment.
6: We also performed DNA extractions on both ground and unground roots, and used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the AMG1F and AM1 primers to amplify any AMF DNA found within the  Podophyllum peltatum roots.
7: We then used gel electrophoresis to determine whether there was AMF colonization of our samples.
8: There were no visible bands on any of the 41 roots examined (a few roots did not yield strong DNA extractions), indicating that the  Podophyllum peltatum roots had no detectable AMF DNA present.
