0: In order to assess the photosynthetic rate of  Podophyllum peltatum across experimental treatments, we used an LI-6400XT portable photosynthesis system.
1: Ambient conditions were mostly sunny with an average photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 1500 mol m 2 s 1 and air temperature of 21 C. Conditions within the chamber were maintained at a flow rate of 400 mol s 1, a CO 2 concentration of 400 mol mol 1, a leaf temperature of 21.4 C, and between 40 and 50 % relative humidity.
2: PPFD was set to 1200 mol m 2 s 1 for all individuals measured.
3: Based on previous data (not presented), this light level represented saturation for plants without inducing photoinhibition.
4: Once plants stabilized in the chamber we logged 3 data points per plant on 23 May 2015 between 11:00 AM and 1:00 PM before rates began to lose stability.
