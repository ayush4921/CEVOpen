<p>To ensure the predictors in the model below were statistically independent, we tested whether soil nutrients (% soil nitrogen, phosphorus 1, phosphorus 2) predicted 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> percent cover in the observational data set. We used three separate linear models with log transformed 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> percent cover—with a small constant (0.001) added before transformation to retain zero values in the data—as a function of log transformed % soil nitrogen, phosphorus 1 or phosphorus 2. This is important because 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> may directly influence soil nutrient availability (

 </xref>). Further, we also explored whether 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> presence, invasive earthworm presence or their interaction predicted soil nutrient availability for % soil nitrogen, phosphorus 1 and phosphorus 2 in separate linear models. Soil nitrogen and phosphorus were log transformed to normalize the data. Because we used observational data, the ‘design’ of this analysis was unbalanced. Therefore, we used ‘type II’ sums of squares (
