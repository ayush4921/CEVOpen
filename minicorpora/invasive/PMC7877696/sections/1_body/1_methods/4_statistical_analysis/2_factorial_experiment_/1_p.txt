0: We fit a linear model with  Podophyllum peltatum final dry biomass as a response variable and  Alliaria petiolata, Lumbricus terrestris and activated carbon treatments, and their interactions as predictors.
1: We used log-transformed final biomass and a Gaussian error distribution.
2: We then conducted planned contrasts within both the  Lumbricus terrestris and  Alliaria petiolata treatments.
3: We explored a model with initial rhizome size (length) as a covariate.
4: Initial size was not predictive of final mass after 2 years in the pot experiment ( F1,38 = 0.11,  P = 0.74), and was, therefore, not included in the final models.
5: Block was not significant in initial models ( F1,38 = 0.71,  P = 0.48), and was not included in final models.
