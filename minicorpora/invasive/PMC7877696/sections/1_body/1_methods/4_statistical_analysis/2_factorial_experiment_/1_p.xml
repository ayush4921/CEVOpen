<p>We fit a linear model with 
 <italic>Podophyllum peltatum</italic> final dry biomass as a response variable and 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata, Lumbricus terrestris</italic> and activated carbon treatments, and their interactions as predictors. We used log-transformed final biomass and a Gaussian error distribution. We then conducted planned contrasts within both the 
 <italic>Lumbricus terrestris</italic> and 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> treatments. We explored a model with initial rhizome size (length) as a covariate. Initial size was not predictive of final mass after 2 years in the pot experiment (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>1,38</sub> = 0.11, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.74), and was, therefore, not included in the final models. Block was not significant in initial models (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>1,38</sub> = 0.71, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.48), and was not included in final models.
