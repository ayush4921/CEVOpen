0: The experiment was located at Case Western Reserve Universitys Squire Valleevue Farm (University Farm below) in Hunting Valley, OH, USA (4129 N, 8125 W) over 2 years (201415).
1: The experiment was organized in a 2  2  2 factorial design, with 6 replicates per experimental treatment, for a total of 48 pots.
2: Each treatment included the presence or absence of the three factors of  Alliaria petiolata,  Lumbricus terrestris and activated carbon ( Fig.
3: 2).
4: Treatments were randomized within 6 replicate blocks in a common garden.
5: We used 57-L pots (45 cm diameter at top  42 cm deep).
6: Pots were covered with 30 % shade cloth (Greenhouse Megastore, Danville, IL, USA) to mimic early forest understory conditions in northeastern Ohio.
7: At midday on a sunny day, when ambient PPFD was ~1800, this resulted in an approximate PPFD of 500 under the shade cloth.
8: Plants were kept well-watered throughout the experiment.
