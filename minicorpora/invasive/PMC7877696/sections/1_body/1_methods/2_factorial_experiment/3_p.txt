0: Pots with an activated carbon present treatment received 400 g of activated carbon pellets incorporated into the soil evenly distributed through the pots ( Lau   et al.
1: 2008 ).
2: We used an amount of activated carbon used in previous experiments ( Lau   et al.
3: 2008 ).
4: To ensure that the  Podophyllum peltatum would receive adequate nutrients, we added 84 g of nutricote 100-day fertilizer with 18-6-8 N-P-K (#18-6-8NUTRI-100, American Horticultural Supply, Inc.) on 5 June 2014 to all pots, following methods in  Hale   et al.
5: (2011) .
6: By adding a small amount of phosphorous, we created conditions where  Podophyllum peltatum plants should have maintained their AMF mutualism ( Hale   et al.
7: 2011 ).
8: Fertilizer treatments can influence the effect of activated carbon ( Lau   et al.
9: 2008 ), so effects of the activated carbon treatment should be interpreted narrowly in this context.
