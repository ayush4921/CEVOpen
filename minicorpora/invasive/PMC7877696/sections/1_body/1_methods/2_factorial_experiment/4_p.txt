0: Pots with a  Lumbricus terrestris present treatment received 16  Lumbricus terrestris worms (~100 earthworms per m 2).
1: This is consistent with natural populations, which can have in excess of 100 individuals per square metre ( Eisenhauer   et al.
2: 2007 ).
3: We observed earthworms feeding by pulling leaf litter down into the soil, found less leaf cover on top of pots [see  Supporting InformationFig.
4: S1], and observed earthworms and their burrows in  Lumbricus terrestris presence treatments at harvest (C.G.
5: Cope, pers.
6: obs), suggesting that our  Lumbricus terrestris presence treatment was effective in adding earthworms to the experimental plants and initiating leaf litter feeding, as expected.
7: We observed no earthworms or their burrows in  Lumbricus terrestris absence treatments.
