0: We analysed only plots with information on the presence or absence of  Alliaria petiolata and/or earthworms to maintain parallel structure to the potted experiment (discussed subsequently).
1: There were a total of 187 plots that met these criteria.
2: Eighty-seven of these plots had zero percent cover of  Podophyllum peltatum.
3: We then compared the percent cover of  Podophyllum peltatum, as well as the percent soil nitrogen and two different measures of inorganic phosphorus in parts per million (ppm) across plots with or without these predictor variables (see analysis below).
