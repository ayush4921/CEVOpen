 <italic>Podophyllum peltatum</italic> leaf nutrient content and internal CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentration were both influenced by experimental treatments. We found leaf nitrogen content was significantly increased in the presence of 
 <italic>Lumbricus terrestris</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). There was also a significant decrease of internal CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentration (C
 <sub>i</sub>) within the leaves of 
 <italic>Podophyllum peltatum</italic> when in the presence of 
 <italic>Lumbricus terrestris</italic> (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). There was a marginally significant reduction in photosynthetic rate when both 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> and activated carbon were present (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), and 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> alone resulted in only a 1 % reduction in photosynthetic rate. Further, there was no effect of 
 <italic>Lumbricus terrestris</italic> on photosynthetic rate (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>).
