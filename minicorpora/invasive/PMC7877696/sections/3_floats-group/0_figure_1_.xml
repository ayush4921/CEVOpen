  <p>The leaf litter of invasive plants, such as 
   <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic>, may negatively influence native plant growth via allelochemicals, (1) which may have direct phytotoxic effects on the native plant, or (2) which may suppress plant mutualists, such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), indirectly suppressing native plants. (3) 
   <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> leaf litter can also influence nutrient availability in the soil. Invasive earthworms can also influence native plants by enhancing nutrient (e.g. nitrogen, phosphorus) availability in the soil, which could (4) interact with invader leaf nutrient input (e.g. via changes in litter decomposition), or could (5) shift the distribution or rate of allelochemical input in the soil. Putative direct effects on native plants are shown with solid arrows and indirect with dashed arrows. Putative negative effects are shown in red and positive effects are shown in blue. Circles indicate putative mechanisms that were not directly measured (i.e. ‘latent variables’ in the language of path analysis). See text in the Introduction for additional details.
