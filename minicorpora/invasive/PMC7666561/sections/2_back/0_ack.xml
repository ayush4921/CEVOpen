 <p>We would like to extend gratitude to Phillip Frost for assisting with the Canadian Fire Weather Index calculations, Tatenda Mapeto for making weather data available, and to Ian Ritchie for constructing the flammability apparatus. Tiaan Strydom, Nicole Blignaut, Natasja Van Zyl, Marita Burger, Corne Brink, Siyabonga Sibisi, Gert Botha, Jooste Eileen and Herman Viviers assisted with specimen collection and flammability experiments. Constructive comments of two anonymous reviewers led to improvements to the manuscript.</p>
