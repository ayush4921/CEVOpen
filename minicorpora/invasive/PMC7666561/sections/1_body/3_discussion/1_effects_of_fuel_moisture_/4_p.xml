<p>Although live fuel moisture content, fire weather conditions, and fuel load had significant effects on some of the flammability measures, these factors did not explain a large portion of variability in the flammability response. Species, which was assessed as a random factor, often accounted for more variation in flammability than the fixed factors combined. This suggests important species effects on flammability, which warrant more detailed investigation. Our method of placing plant shoots horizontally on the barrel cavity grill with different amounts and sizes of plant parts oriented towards the grill could have introduced additional variation in the flammability response.</p>
