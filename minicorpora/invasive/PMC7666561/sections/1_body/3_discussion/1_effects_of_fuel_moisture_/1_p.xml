<p>Fuel moisture content is widely regarded to be a major determinant of flammability in grassland, shrubland and forested ecosystems with sufficient evidence of its dampening effects on fire behaviour and flammability (

 <xref rid="ref-55" ref-type="bibr">Nolan et al., 2016</xref>). Accordingly, live fuel moisture in this study was not significantly correlated with fire weather in any of the study species. Live fuel moisture did significantly (negatively) correlate to burn intensity and completeness of burn, but the magnitude of its influence on flammability relative to the other factors investigated was generally low.
