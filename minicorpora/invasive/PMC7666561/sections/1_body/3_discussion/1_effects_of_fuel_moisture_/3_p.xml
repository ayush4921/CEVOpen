<p>Fuel load had varying effects on flammability, depending on the measure considered; it increased burn intensity, but reduced ignitability. These findings support other evidence for positive correlations between the amount of biomass (~fuel load) that vegetation presents and fire intensity or severity (

Such contrasting effects on the different aspects of flammability relate to variation in fuel structural traits and emphasize the need to consider flammability in terms of its constituent measures rather than treating it as a composite measure (
