0: The primary aim of our study was to compare the flammability of live plant material amongst three vegetation groupsIAPs, fynbos, and thicketand under varying fire weather conditions.
1: Flammability measures considered were burn intensity, completeness of burn, and ignitability (time-to-ignition and likelihood of spontaneous ignition), while fuel traits considered were live fuel moisture and fuel load.
2: A secondary aim was to assess the flammability of partially dried plant material as a crude proxy for drought effects, to ascertain whether drying of fuels (~drought) would differentially affect the flammability of the vegetation groups of interest.
3: Study results will inform fire risk management in the southern Cape landscapes and elsewhere with similar fuel traits and characteristics.
