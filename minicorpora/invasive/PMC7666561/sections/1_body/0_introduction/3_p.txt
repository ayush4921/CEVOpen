0: Globally, extreme fires have become more common in recent years.
1: Examples include the shrublands of California, Australia, Europe ( Montenegro et al., 2004;  San-Miguel-Ayanz, Moreno & Camia, 2013), and more recently, South Africa ( Kraaij et al., 2018).
2: These fires have been accredited to the combinations of climate change (in the form of weather conditions more conducive to fire and extended droughts), increased ignitions, expanded wildland-urban interface areas linked to increasing human populations, and changes in fuels that are often human-induced ( Archibald et al., 2008;  Montenegro et al., 2004;  Syphard et al., 2017;  Turco et al., 2017;  Van Wilgen, 1984).
3: Fuels accumulate far beyond normal levels when humans suppress fires to safeguard assets, and due to invasion by invasive alien plants (hereafter IAPs) ( Kraaij et al., 2018;  Radeloff et al., 2005;  Scott, Versfeld & Lesch, 1998).
4: The IAPs may affect flammability by altering the fuel structure, fuel distribution (horizontal or vertical fuel continuity), live fuel moisture, chemical contents and fuel load ( Brooks et al., 2004;  Davies & Nafus, 2013;  Richardson & Van Wilgen, 2004).
5: Extreme fires are also known to occur in shrublands after severe droughts due to the increase of dead (~dry) to live fuel ratios ( Keeley et al., 2012;  Keeley & Syphard, 2017;  Kraaij et al., 2018).
