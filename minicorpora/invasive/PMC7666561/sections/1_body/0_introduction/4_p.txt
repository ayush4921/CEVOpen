0: Along the southern Cape coast of South Africa, fynbos and thicket shrublands occur interspersed ( Fig.
1: S1) despite displaying different fire dynamics and fuel structural traits ( Campbell et al., 1981;  Moll et al., 1984).
2: Fynbos ecosystems commonly support fires that consume surface and canopy fuels and comprise species that readily burn to open recruitment opportunities (gaps) post-fire ( Buhk, Meyn & Jentsch, 2007;  Deacon, Jury & Ellis, 1992).
3: However, thicket mostly does not exhibit high flammability traits ( Calitz, Potts & Cowling, 2015), and recruitment from seed largely occurs in inter-fire periods ( Cowling et al., 1997;  Pierce & Cowling, 1984).
4: In 2017, extreme fires occurred in this region around the town of Knysna which burnt indigenous fynbos and thicket vegetation and further caused extensive damage to commercial plantations and residential properties ( Fares et al., 2017;  Kraaij et al., 2018).
5: The extreme nature of these fires has been attributed to extensive IAP fuels, an expansive wildland-urban interface area, an unprecedented regional drought preceding the fires which likely greatly increased litter fuels in thicket, fynbos and stands of IAPs, and very high fire danger weather conditions at the time of the fires ( Kraaij et al., 2018;  Preston, 2017).
6: The 2017 Knysna fires called for improved understanding of potential differences in flammability among vegetation groups, including IAPs occurring in this region.
7: An analysis of satellite image derived proxies for burn severity showed it to be higher, but completeness of burn lower, in IAPs than in indigenous fynbos and thicket vegetation ( Kraaij et al., 2018).
8: However, the findings have not been verified with field observations ( Kraaij et al., 2018).
9: Other studies have experimentally compared the flammability of species from several biomes (both fire-prone and fire-resistant) ( Burger & Bond, 2015;  Calitz, Potts & Cowling, 2015); however, no study has compared the flammability of indigenous vegetation with that of IAPs, nor under varying fire weather conditions.
