0: Flammability is affected by weather conditions ( Bond, 1997;  Keeley & Syphard, 2017).
1: Fire danger indicesbased on ambient temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and rainfallare commonly used to rate the fire-proneness of weather conditions ( Dowdy et al., 2009;  Noble, Gill & Bary, 1980;  Sirca et al., 2018).
2: Flammability is also influenced by fuel properties such as the amount of flammable plant material (fuel load), packing ratio and chemical composition ( Brooks et al., 2004;  Burger & Bond, 2015;  Curran et al., 2017).
3: For instance, greater fuel loads or volatile substances can increase fire intensity ( Baeza et al., 2002;  Saura-Mas et al., 2010).
