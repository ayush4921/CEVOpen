0: Flammability is the ability of vegetation (fuel) to burn ( Fernandes & Cruz, 2012;  Gill & Zylstra, 2005) and is a measure of fire behavior (fire intensity/severity) used in vegetation fire risk mitigation studies ( Keeley, 2009).
1: Vegetation flammability may result from climatic and weather effects ( Bond & Midgley, 1995;  Mutch, 1970;  Snyder, 1984).
2: For example, in arid areas, dryness limits fuel accumulation and fires follow episodic rain, whereas in temperate areas, fuel loads are not limiting but fires follow the drying of those fuels ( Bradstock, 2010;  Pausas & Bradstock, 2007), however dry conditions may also result in an increase in fire risk caused by the availability of dried fuels ( Pinol, Terradas & Llored, 1998).
3: Fire-prone vegetation groups may furthermore have evolved traits that enhance their flammability and improve vegetation fitness in fire-dependent communities ( Bond & Midgley, 1995).
4: Correspondingly, species with high flammability traits may burn intensely, such that itself and the neighbour die, thereby facilitating recruitmentthe kill thy neighbour hypothesis ( Bond & Midgley, 1995).
5: Flammability traits may thus provide resilience associated with fire tolerance ( Bond & Midgley, 1995;  Calitz, Potts & Cowling, 2015).
6: Fire is accordingly one of the main determining factors of the ecology and distribution of ecosystems of the world, and is important for maintaining plant diversity ( Bond, 1997;  Bond, Midgley & Woodward, 2003;  Bond & Keeley, 2005).
