<p>Fire weather and live fuel moisture were not significantly correlated within any of the study species (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-2">Table S1</xref>). Increasing severity of fire weather significantly increased flammability through increasing burn intensity, increasing completeness of burn, increasing the likelihood of spontaneous ignition, and reducing time-to-ignition (
 <xref rid="table-1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Fig. 1</xref>). Increasing live fuel moisture significantly decreased burn intensity, completeness of burn, and the likelihood of spontaneous ignition. Fuel load significantly increased burn intensity and time-to-ignition.
