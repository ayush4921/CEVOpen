<p>Our experimental burning of shoots of 30 shrub species confirmed that fire weather, live fuel moisture, and fuel load have significant effects on flammability measures. However, vegetation group and species differences accounted for most of the variation in flammability. Flammability was generally highest in invasive alien plants, intermediate in fynbos, and lowest in thicket. The drying of plant shoots resulted in increases in flammability that were comparable among vegetation groups, implying that under drought conditions, fire risk should not increase disproportionately in one vegetation group compared to another, unless the production of dead fuels is disproportionate among vegetation groups.</p>
