0: We compared the flammability (in terms of burn intensity, completeness of burn, and time-to-ignition, respectively) of the dried samples with that of live samples of the same species that was measured on five occasions under comparable fire weather conditions.
1: We calculated the change in flammability between live and dried samples by subtracting the flammability measure of each live sample from that of its dried counterpart.
2: We then used this derived variable as response variable and employed Kruskal-Wallis to test whether the difference in flammability between live and dried samples varied among vegetation groups.
