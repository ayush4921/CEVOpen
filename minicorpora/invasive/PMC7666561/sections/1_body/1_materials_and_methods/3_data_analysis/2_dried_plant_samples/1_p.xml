<p>We compared the flammability (in terms of burn intensity, completeness of burn, and time-to-ignition, respectively) of the dried samples with that of live samples of the same species that was measured on five occasions under comparable fire weather conditions. We calculated the change in flammability between live and dried samples by subtracting the flammability measure of each live sample from that of its dried counterpart. We then used this derived variable as response variable and employed Kruskal-Wallis to test whether the difference in flammability between live and dried samples varied among vegetation groups.</p>
