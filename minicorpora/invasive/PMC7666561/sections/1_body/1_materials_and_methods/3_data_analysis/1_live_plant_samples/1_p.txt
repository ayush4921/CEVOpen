0: We assessed flammability (of live samples) in terms of four response variables (burn intensity, completeness of burn, time-to-ignition, and spontaneous ignition) respectively, in relation to the predictor variables (i) fire weather (continuous), (ii) live fuel moisture (continuous), (iii) fuel load (dry plant mass; continuous), (iv) vegetation groups (IAPs, fynbos, thicket; categorical) and (v) species (30 species; categorical) using generalized linear mixed-effects models ( Bates, 2010;  OHara, 2009) using the  lme4 package ( Bates, 2010) in the open-source R software version 3.6.1 ( R Development Core Team, 2019).
1: Detailed species-level comparisons were not the primary focus of the study and species was therefore included as a random factor, whereas the other predictor variables were included as fixed factors.
2: To test for potential collinearity between fire weather and live fuel moisture, we ran the Spearman-rank correlation test for each respective species.
3: It showed that these variables were not significantly correlated (see Results) and could both be retained in subsequent analyses.
4: Burn intensity was log-transformed (to correct right-skewed distribution), completeness of burn arcsine-transformed (as it was expressed as proportions), time-to-ignition square root-transformed (to correct left-skewed distribution), and spontaneous ignition assessed using logistic regression (binomial family, logit link function) (formulae provided in  Table S2).
5: Subsequently, Type II Wald chi-square test ( Hastie & Pregibon, 1992) was computed to determine the significance of fixed factors on the specific models.
6: We incorporated the scale function to the generalized linear mixed-effects models and logistic regression model (using transformed data) to standardize variables of different scales and obtain the relative influence of fixed factors ( Becker, Chambers & Wilks, 2018).
