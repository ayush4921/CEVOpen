0: The vegetation of the study area is classified as Southern Cape Dune Fynbos ( Mucina & Rutherford, 2006;  Pierce & Cowling, 1984), which consists of medium-dense sclerophyllous fynbos (~fine-leaved) shrublands up to 2 m in height, interspersed with dense clumps of subtropical mesophyllous thicket shrubs or trees up to 4 m in height ( Fig.
1: S1) ( Campbell et al., 1981;  Kraaij, Cowling & Van Wilgen, 2011;  Pierce & Cowling, 1984).
2: Both fynbos and thicket are evergreen.
3: Fynbos shrublands are fire-prone and flammable while smaller areas of thicket vegetation seldom burn ( Geldenhuys, 1994).
4: The persistence of fynbos-thicket mosaics requires fire at appropriate intervals (1525 years) since thicket becomes dominant in the prolonged absence of fire ( Kraaij & Van Wilgen, 2014;  Strydom et al., 2020).
5: The area contains extensive invasions of alien shrubs and trees, commonly of the genera  Acacia, Eucalyptus and  Pinus, that co-occur with, and potentially replace, the native vegetation ( Fig.
6: S1) ( Baard & Kraaij, 2014;  Van Wilgen et al., 2016).
