0: To investigate whether simulated drought conditions differentially affected the flammability of the vegetation groups, additional samples (similar to that collected for the flammability experiments live samples described above) were collected and left to dry under ambient conditions, out of direct sunlight, for a minimum of two weeks but not until leaf loss occurred.
1: Sampling was conducted over five occasions (during FebruaryMarch 2019) of high fire weather conditions.
2: The drying duration was standardized for all species within each of the sampling occasions to avoid the loss of leaves since certain plants would drop leaves due to drought stress ( Clarke & McCaig, 1982).
3: Flammability experiments and pre-burn estimations of live fuel moisture were undertaken on these dried samples as described above for live (undried) samples.
