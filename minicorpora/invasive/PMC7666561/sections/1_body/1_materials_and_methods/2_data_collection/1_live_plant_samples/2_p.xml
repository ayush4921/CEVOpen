<p>Samples used for flammability were burnt outdoors using an approach similar to that of

 <xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">Curran et al. (2017)</xref>. Plant flammability was measured using the method and equipment described by 
 <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">Jaureguiberry, Bertone &amp; Díaz (2011)</xref>, the apparatus comprises a metal barrel (85 cm × 60 cm) that is horizontally orientated with the top removable half that is used for wind protection (
 <xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">Baeza et al., 2002</xref>). The metal barrel is connected to a grill thermometer, removable gas cylinder and a blowtorch (

 <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">Jaureguiberry, Bertone &amp; Díaz, 2011</xref>). Each sample was placed on the barrel cavity grill to pre-heat at 230 °C for 2 min to imitate the heating and drying effect of an approaching fire. If the samples had not spontaneously ignited within two minutes, it was ignited at the top of the shoot by exposing it to the blow torch for a period of five seconds (

 <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">Jaureguiberry, Bertone &amp; Díaz, 2011</xref>). It further enables a more realistic comparison of relative canopy flammability among species than methods that use only smaller plant components (i.e., twigs or leaves) (
