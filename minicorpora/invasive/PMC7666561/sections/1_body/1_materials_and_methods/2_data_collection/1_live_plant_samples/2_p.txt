0: Samples used for flammability were burnt outdoors using an approach similar to that of  Calitz, Potts & Cowling (2015) and  Curran et al.
1: (2017).
2: Plant flammability was measured using the method and equipment described by  Jaureguiberry, Bertone & Diaz (2011), the apparatus comprises a metal barrel (85 cm  60 cm) that is horizontally orientated with the top removable half that is used for wind protection ( Baeza et al., 2002).
3: The metal barrel is connected to a grill thermometer, removable gas cylinder and a blowtorch ( Curran et al., 2017;  Jaureguiberry, Bertone & Diaz, 2011).
4: Each sample was placed on the barrel cavity grill to pre-heat at 230 C for 2 min to imitate the heating and drying effect of an approaching fire.
5: If the samples had not spontaneously ignited within two minutes, it was ignited at the top of the shoot by exposing it to the blow torch for a period of five seconds ( Calitz, Potts & Cowling, 2015).
6: Advantages of using this apparatus are that it preserves the architectural arrangement of plant material ( Jaureguiberry, Bertone & Diaz, 2011).
7: It further enables a more realistic comparison of relative canopy flammability among species than methods that use only smaller plant components (i.e., twigs or leaves) ( Burger & Bond, 2015;  Jaureguiberry, Bertone & Diaz, 2011).
