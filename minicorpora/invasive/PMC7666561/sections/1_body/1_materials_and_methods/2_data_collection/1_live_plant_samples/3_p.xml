<p>Four aspects associated with species-level flammability were measured and recorded (largely after 
 <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">Calitz, Potts &amp; Cowling, 2015</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">Jaureguiberry, Bertone &amp; Díaz, 2011</xref>). Firstly, burn intensity taken as the maximum temperature (cf. 
 <xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr">Keeley, 2009</xref>) reached by a sample while burning, measured using an infrared thermometer (Major Tech 695; maximum recordable temperature: 800 °C) after 
 <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">Jaureguiberry, Bertone &amp; Díaz (2011)</xref>. Secondly, the completeness of burn, calculated as the proportion of the pre-burn wet mass of the samples that was consumed by the fire (mass was measured using an electronic scale). Thirdly, time-to-ignition, measured as the time elapsed between placement of the samples on the grill and spontaneous ignition (appearance of the first flame); samples that required to be ignited with the blow torch were therefore excluded from this measure in the dataset. For every sample, we recorded whether it spontaneously ignited within the two minutes (pre-heating duration was consistent as there were many samples) of pre-heating or not, this binomial response comprising the fourth measure termed “spontaneous ignition”.
