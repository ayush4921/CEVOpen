0: Four aspects associated with species-level flammability were measured and recorded (largely after  Calitz, Potts & Cowling, 2015 and  Jaureguiberry, Bertone & Diaz, 2011).
1: Firstly, burn intensity taken as the maximum temperature (cf.
2: Keeley, 2009) reached by a sample while burning, measured using an infrared thermometer (Major Tech 695; maximum recordable temperature: 800 C) after  Jaureguiberry, Bertone & Diaz (2011).
3: Secondly, the completeness of burn, calculated as the proportion of the pre-burn wet mass of the samples that was consumed by the fire (mass was measured using an electronic scale).
4: Thirdly, time-to-ignition, measured as the time elapsed between placement of the samples on the grill and spontaneous ignition (appearance of the first flame); samples that required to be ignited with the blow torch were therefore excluded from this measure in the dataset.
5: For every sample, we recorded whether it spontaneously ignited within the two minutes (pre-heating duration was consistent as there were many samples) of pre-heating or not, this binomial response comprising the fourth measure termed spontaneous ignition.
