<p>Live fuel moisture was calculated on a sample shoot similar in dimensions to that of flammability measurements. The fresh material was stored in sealed containers (of known mass) until these were weighed (within less than 3 h of collection) to obtain wet fuel mass. Samples were then oven-dried at 80 Â°C for 48 h and weighed again to obtain dry fuel mass (

Although sample size (shoot length) was standardized, samples nevertheless presented different fuel loads which are directly related to burn intensity (
