0: Live fuel moisture was calculated on a sample shoot similar in dimensions to that of flammability measurements.
1: The fresh material was stored in sealed containers (of known mass) until these were weighed (within less than 3 h of collection) to obtain wet fuel mass.
2: Samples were then oven-dried at 80 C for 48 h and weighed again to obtain dry fuel mass ( Ruffault et al., 2018;  Teie, 2009;  Yebra et al., 2019).
3: The live fuel moisture was calculated as the percentage of wet mass comprised of water.
4: Although sample size (shoot length) was standardized, samples nevertheless presented different fuel loads which are directly related to burn intensity ( Byram, 1959).
5: Thus, dry plant mass was used to represent the variable fuel load.
6: We estimated the dry plant mass of each sample from its pre-burn wet mass and the percentage water content that was calculated for its analogous dried sample.
