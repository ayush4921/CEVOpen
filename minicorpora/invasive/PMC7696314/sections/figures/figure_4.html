 <caption> Total and forage species diversity expressed as the Shannon–Weiner index (H’) for the above-ground plant community and at the three survey occasions of the plant mixtures and the control treatment, where ( a) shows the total species diversity including sowed species; ( b) shows the species diversity excluding sowed species; ( c) shows the forage species diversity including sowed species; ( d) shows the forage species diversity excluding sowed species. Solid black line with circles shows control treatment, while dotted grey lines with squares and triangles show mixture one (Rhodes grass + creeping bluegrass + butterfly pea + green panic) and mixture two (forest bluegrass + Queensland bluegrass + siratro + Buffel grass), respectively.* p &lt; 0.05; ** p &lt; 0.01. </caption>
