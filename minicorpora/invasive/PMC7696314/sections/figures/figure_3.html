 <caption> Effect of two plant mixtures (treatments) and the unsown control on the above-ground plant community. The illustration was drawn by non-metric multidimensional scaling in two dimensions on abundance data, based on a Brayâ€“Curtis dissimilarity matrix and across three survey occasions. Note mixture one data ( ) are enclosed as only this mixture did not overlap with the control. </caption>
