0: On each occasion prior to the simulated grazing, species diversity within the above-ground communities was assessed using the ShannonWeiner index (1), both for the whole plant community ( H total) and for the species that were considered to be forage species consumed by domestic livestock ( H forage species): H =   Si= 1p   ilog  ep   i(1) where  S is the number of species or species richness and  p  i is the relative abundance of each species, calculated as the proportion of individuals of a given species to the total number of individuals in the community  P   i =   n   i/  N(2) where  n  i is the number of individuals in species  i (i.e., the abundance of species  i) and  N is the total number of all individuals [ 44].
1: The evenness within the above-ground vegetation was assessed using the Pielous evenness index (2), both for the whole community ( J  total) and for the forage species ( J  forage species): E =   H/  Hmax(3) where  E is the equitability of species whose value ranges from 0 to 1,  H is the observed species diversity and  Hmax is the maximum species diversity,  Hmax = log eS  [ 44, 45].
