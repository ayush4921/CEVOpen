<p>Data sets of species diversity (
 <italic>H</italic>′) and evenness (
 <italic>J</italic>′) and biomass production were analyzed by running an ANOVA using a general linear model procedure in Minitab, version 16 (Minitab Inc., PA, USA). The general linear model was set up with the three simulated grazing times (30, 60 and 90 DAE) and three grassland plant treatments (control, seed mixture 1 and seed mixture 2) as the main factors for the analysis of the species diversity and evenness indexes and biomass variables. Analysis was undertaken using an adjusted sum of squares approach using 95.0% confidence intervals. A transformation of the data set was required when the assumptions of the ANOVA were not met (e.g., species abundance and parthenium weed biomass). However, for all cases the significance of the test did not change, therefore for practical purposes the results are presented as the original values.
