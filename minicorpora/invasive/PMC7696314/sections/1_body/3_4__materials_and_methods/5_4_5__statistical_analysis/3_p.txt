0: Data sets of species diversity ( H) and evenness ( J) and biomass production were analyzed by running an ANOVA using a general linear model procedure in Minitab, version 16 (Minitab Inc., PA, USA).
1: The general linear model was set up with the three simulated grazing times (30, 60 and 90 DAE) and three grassland plant treatments (control, seed mixture 1 and seed mixture 2) as the main factors for the analysis of the species diversity and evenness indexes and biomass variables.
2: Analysis was undertaken using an adjusted sum of squares approach using 95.0% confidence intervals.
3: A transformation of the data set was required when the assumptions of the ANOVA were not met (e.g., species abundance and parthenium weed biomass).
4: However, for all cases the significance of the test did not change, therefore for practical purposes the results are presented as the original values.
