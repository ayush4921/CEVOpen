<p>Patterns of plant species composition and temporal changes in response to the treatments were determined using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) in two dimensions on both species abundance and presence/absence data, based on a Bray–Curtis dissimilarity matrix. The extent of clustering according to the plant mixtures was assessed using a maximum of 5000 permutations in an analysis of similarity (ANOSIM), an analogue of the univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) specifically developed for ecological data, which tests for differences between and within groups of samples (multivariate) from different times and treatments, and does not require normality and homoscedasticity assumptions, generating the statistic R. Values of R range from −1 to +1, with values approaching R = +1 indicating a strong dissimilarity among samples. When differences between treatment plots at α &lt; 0.05 or lower were detected, a ”similarity percentage” routine (SIMPER) was used in order to identify which species were primarily contributing to the similarities/dissimilarities among treatments. Species abundance was subjected to square root transformation to enhance their fit to the models. Both abundance and presence or absence data sets gave similar results and so only those from square-root-transformed abundance data are presented. All multivariate analyses were performed using the software Primer (Version 6.0; Primer Technologies, Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA).</p>
