0: Once the plants had established and were growing rapidly, three simulated grazing times were made at 30, 60 and 90 days after emergence (DAE).
1: The simulated grazing times consisted of cutting (with scissors) both the sown and unsown grass species at a point that was equal to 50% of their average height.
2: The average heights were determined from a permanent quadrat that had been placed in the middle of each the various treatment plots.
3: Those quadrats that had been cut on a previous simulated grazing time were not re-cut at 60 and 90 DAE.
4: Upon cutting, all plant material was divided into either parthenium weed, sown species or all other unsown grass species.
5: These samples were put into separate paper bags and dried in an oven at 70C for 3 days.
6: Species considered to be weeds (for instance, all unsown broadleaved species, such as Paddys Lucerne ( Sida rhombofolia L.), purslane ( Portulaca oleracea L.) and spiny amaranth ( Amaranthus spinosus L.) were not included in the biomass samples taken, as it was assumed these species would not be grazed.
7: Just prior to each of these simulated grazing interventions, species identification and abundance were also determined.
