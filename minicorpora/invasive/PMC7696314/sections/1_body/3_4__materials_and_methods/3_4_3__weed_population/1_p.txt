0: To estimate the size of the parthenium weed population across the site and prior to the sowing of plant mixtures, the soil seed bank was determined from five soil cores (each of ca.
1: 7.2 cm in diameter and 10.0 cm deep) collected from the four corners and the centre of three randomly placed quadrats (1 m 2 each).
2: The five samples from each quadrat were then mixed, providing a total of three random samples taken from over the whole study site.
3: A sub-sample from each soil seed bank sample of ca.
4: 600 g was were then spread thinly ( ca.
5: 5 mm) over a sterilized soil mixture (University of California mixture; forming a 3 cm thick basal layer) that was contained within shallow plastic germination trays (each 20  25  6 cm, w/L/h; one soil sample per tray).
6: These trays were then placed at random onto a bench in a shade house, wetted to field capacity and then analyzed for emerging seedlings over a 6 month period to allow for all of the species in the seed bank to be identified, including those with long-term seed dormancy.
7: Three control trays of the sterilized soil mixture were placed among the experimental trays to monitor for any seedlings that may have arisen from this mixture or from the glasshouse environment.
8: Once they emerged, seedlings were identified and counted, removed and discarded.
9: In the case where immediate identification was not possible, representative individuals were planted into small pots of compost and grown to maturity, to allow for later taxonomic identification.
10: When no further emergence was recorded in the seedling trays for a period of 2 weeks (ca.
11: 26 weeks after the start of the study), the soil was allowed to dry for 1 week, stirred, then rewetted to trigger further germination.
