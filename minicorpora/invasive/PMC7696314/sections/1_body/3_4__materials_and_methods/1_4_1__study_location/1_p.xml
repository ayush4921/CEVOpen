<p>This field study was conducted in the Kilcoy district (26.57° S, 152.30° E, 189 m above sea level) of south-east Queensland, Australia, from September 2011 to March 2012. The topography of the site was gently sloping with good drainage and consisted of a typical soil for the region (i.e., a brown-grey dermosol, pH 6). The characteristic vegetation of the region was originally a native grassland that has been under continuous grazing for at least 100 years and infested with parthenium weed for at least 25 years (D. Youles, personal communication 2011). This grazing practice has led to the replacement of certain desirable native species such as black speargrass (
 <italic>Heteropogon contortus</italic> L.) with other less desirable species such as green couch (
 <italic>Cynodon dactylon</italic> (L.) Pers.). The majority of the species present within these grasslands are perennials with a high presence of forbs and graminoids [

 <xref rid="B14-plants-09-01587" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. A two-strata vegetation system has developed, as is commonly found in long-term grazed, sub-humid grasslands, and consists of a low dense stratum, no more than 5 cm tall, and a taller stratum of bunched grasses and small woody plants [
 <xref rid="B41-plants-09-01587" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The leaf-feeding beetle (
 <italic>Z. bicolorata</italic>) has been present in south-east Queensland for at least 25 years and present at the Kilcoy site for at least 20 years.
