<p>The climate at the site is sub-tropical, with a long-term average annual precipitation of 959 mm, occurring mainly in the summer months of January and February. Before and during this study, the annual rainfall was well above average in 2010 (1619 mm), above average in 2011 (1168 mm) and close to average in 2012 (980 mm) [

 <sup>−1</sup> during the drier winter months (June to August) and 0.8 cows ha
 <sup>−1</sup> during the wetter summer months (December to February). Just prior to use, the site was cleared of vegetation using a bulldozer fixed with a front blade, then cultivated three times to a depth of ca. 20 cm using a disc cultivator (Connor Shea 18 Disc Series, Connor Shea Napier Pty Ltd., Melbourne, Victoria). The site was then protected by a wire fence that prevented unwanted entry of cattle and wildlife for the duration of the study.
