0: This field study was conducted in the Kilcoy district (26.57 S, 152.30 E, 189 m above sea level) of south-east Queensland, Australia, from September 2011 to March 2012.
1: The topography of the site was gently sloping with good drainage and consisted of a typical soil for the region (i.e., a brown-grey dermosol, pH 6).
2: The characteristic vegetation of the region was originally a native grassland that has been under continuous grazing for at least 100 years and infested with parthenium weed for at least 25 years (D. Youles, personal communication 2011).
3: This grazing practice has led to the replacement of certain desirable native species such as black speargrass ( Heteropogon contortus L.) with other less desirable species such as green couch ( Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.).
4: The majority of the species present within these grasslands are perennials with a high presence of forbs and graminoids [ 8, 14].
5: A two-strata vegetation system has developed, as is commonly found in long-term grazed, sub-humid grasslands, and consists of a low dense stratum, no more than 5 cm tall, and a taller stratum of bunched grasses and small woody plants [ 41].
6: The leaf-feeding beetle ( Z. bicolorata) has been present in south-east Queensland for at least 25 years and present at the Kilcoy site for at least 20 years.
