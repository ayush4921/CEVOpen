<p>The experiment was performed using a Latin square fully randomized design within a total study site area of ca. 225 m
 <sup>2</sup>. Each of the two sown plant mixtures was replicated three times with a net plot size of 3 m × 3 m. Moreover, three unsown plots were maintained as control plots. Within each 3 × 3 m treatment plot, a permanent quadrat (1 m × 1 m) was marked out in the middle, from which plant heights could be calculated at each of the simulated grazing times. A 1 m wide path was maintained around each treatment plot, and a 2 m wide path was maintained around the study site and inside the fence line to avoid any “edge effects” within three randomly placed quadrats (each 1 m
 <sup>2</sup>).
