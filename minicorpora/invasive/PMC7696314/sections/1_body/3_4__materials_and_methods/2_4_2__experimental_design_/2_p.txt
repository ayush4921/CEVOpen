0: The plant mixtures were created by considering the following criteria: the species were previously shown to be suppressive of the growth of parthenium weed (either ranked as strongly or moderately suppressive) [ 23], species providing functional group complementation (e.g., providing a stabilizing effect upon forage production and quality [ 43], species known to have good germination, seedling establishment and growth in the Kilcoy district and species recommended by the local experts.
1: Ultimately, seed lot availability was the defining factor determining the final mixture composition ( Table 4).
