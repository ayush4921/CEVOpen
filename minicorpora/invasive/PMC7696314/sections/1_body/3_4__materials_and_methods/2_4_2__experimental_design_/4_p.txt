0: Sowing of pre-weighed plant mixtures was undertaken in late November 2011 immediately after the last disc ploughing occasion.
1: To achieve an even sowing rate in each treatment plot the seed mixes were added to dry sawdust (5 g of sawdust to each 1 g of seed mix), mixed well, then evenly spread by hand over the appropriate treatment plot.
2: Next, the seed mix was covered by hand-raking of the soft soil surface, and was then compacted under foot to ensure good seed-to-soil contact.
3: Several unsown control plots were marked, consisting of the vegetation established after the last disc ploughing.
