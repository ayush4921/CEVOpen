0: The experiment was performed using a Latin square fully randomized design within a total study site area of ca.
1: 225 m 2.
2: Each of the two sown plant mixtures was replicated three times with a net plot size of 3 m  3 m. Moreover, three unsown plots were maintained as control plots.
3: Within each 3  3 m treatment plot, a permanent quadrat (1 m  1 m) was marked out in the middle, from which plant heights could be calculated at each of the simulated grazing times.
4: A 1 m wide path was maintained around each treatment plot, and a 2 m wide path was maintained around the study site and inside the fence line to avoid any edge effects within three randomly placed quadrats (each 1 m 2).
