0: All plant seed lots used in the mixtures were obtained from seed companies, then cleaned, air dried and stored at 15  1 C and 15  2% relative humidity (RH) in a seed store before being used.
1: In order to use an appropriate sowing rate for each species in the field, a laboratory germination test was undertaken on a sub-sample of the seed lot in a germination incubator (day/night temperature regime 25/20  2 C with a 12 h day/12 h night photoperiod and light intensity of 100 mol m 2 s 1), mimicking the environmental conditions in the field at the peak time for germination of parthenium weed [ 7].
2: The germination value was then used to modify the recommended sowing rates ( Table 4).
