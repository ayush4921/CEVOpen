0: Invasive alien plant species negatively affect ecosystem structure and functioning at multiple tiers [ 1, 2].
1: These species often disturb the native species composition and reduce the vegetative biodiversity by dominating the landscape of the invaded area.
2: Parthenium weed ( Parthenium hysterophorus L.) is such an invasive weed species, having immense ecological and agricultural impacts [ 3].
3: Originating from the tropical and subtropical Americas, this noxious invader has now infested more than 40 countries around the world, including in Africa, Asia, the Pacific and Australia [ 4].
4: It is a major weed in crops and pastures, acts as an alternative host to several major crop pests, negatively affects native plant species diversity within a wide range of environments, causes toxicity problems to domesticated livestock and significant health problems to people [ 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12].
5: Parthenium weed is an aggressive invader due to its unique biological, physiological and ecological adaptive features [ 5, 13, 14].
