0: Another important management approach is the use of competitive/suppressive pasture plant species to control parthenium weed.
1: The use of competitive crop cultivars or improving the crop competition to manage weeds have proved successful in Australian crop production systems [ 22].
2: However, relatively little research has been carried out to explore the potential of suppressive plant species with a secondary fodder value to control environmental and/or grassland weed species such as parthenium weed [ 23].
3: Previous studies in Australia have shown that several valuable pasture grass and legume species such as Bisset bluegrass ( Bothriochloa insculpta Hochst.

5: Rich A. Camus), Floren bluegrass ( Dichanthium aristatum Poir.

7: Hubb), Buffel grass ( Cenchrus ciliaris L.) and butterfly pea ( Clitoria ternatea L.), when sown alone, can successfully suppress the growth of parthenium weed under glasshouse conditions [ 23, 24].
8: The Bisset bluegrass, Floren bluegrass, Buffel grass, Rhodes grass ( Chloris gayana Kunth) and Queensland bluegrass ( Dichanthium sericeum (R.
9: Br.)
10: A. Camus) were able to suppress the growth of parthenium weed under field conditions [ 23, 25].
11: However, for a practical application of an approach using suppressive plants, the use of only one species will be unable to provide the best quality fodder as compared to using a mixture of species and will not contribute to the diversification of the grassland agroecosystem [ 26, 27].
12: Additionally, the sowing of a single species might pose a long-term threat as the repeated sowing of the same species might lead to that plant itself becoming invasive [ 28].
