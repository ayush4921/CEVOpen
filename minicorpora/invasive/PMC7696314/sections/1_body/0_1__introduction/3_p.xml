<p>Another important management approach is the use of competitive/suppressive pasture plant species to control parthenium weed. The use of competitive crop cultivars or improving the crop competition to manage weeds have proved successful in Australian crop production systems [
 <xref rid="B22-plants-09-01587" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, relatively little research has been carried out to explore the potential of suppressive plant species with a secondary fodder value to control environmental and/or grassland weed species such as parthenium weed [
 <xref rid="B23-plants-09-01587" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Previous studies in Australia have shown that several valuable pasture grass and legume species such as Bisset bluegrass (

 <italic>Dichanthium aristatum</italic> Poir. C.E. Hubb), Buffel grass (
 <italic>Cenchrus ciliaris</italic> L.) and butterfly pea (
 <italic>Clitoria ternatea</italic> L.), when sown alone, can successfully suppress the growth of parthenium weed under glasshouse conditions [

 <italic>Dichanthium sericeum</italic> (R. Br.) A. Camus) were able to suppress the growth of parthenium weed under field conditions [

However, for a practical application of an approach using suppressive plants, the use of only one species will be unable to provide the best quality fodder as compared to using a mixture of species and will not contribute to the diversification of the grassland agroecosystem [
