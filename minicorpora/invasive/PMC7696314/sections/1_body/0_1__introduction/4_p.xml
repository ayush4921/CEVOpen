<p>The benefits of increasing species diversity within a grassland-based agroecosystem will include not only the creation of a higher and more stable fodder biomass production but also improved forage quality and palatability [

Thus, increasing a grasslandâ€™s diversity, especially if achieved with desirable native plants, should be one of the main objectives and ultimately influence the pasture management recommendations. It is also important to note that suppressive plant species may act synergistically with the biological control agents of parthenium weed [

 <xref rid="B32-plants-09-01587" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Therefore, the potential of suppressive plants must be explored in a broader integrated management context.
