0: Parthenium weed has infested an area of more than 60 million ha in Queensland, Australia [ 3].
1: Adamson [ 15] reported losses worth $69 million (AUD) per annum in the beef industry due to parthenium weed.
2: Different management approaches have been used to control parthenium weed with varying degrees of success.
3: Several chemical herbicides provide effective control of this species.
4: However, the large scale weed infestations and the environmental concerns rule out the continuous and frequent use of chemicals.
5: Ecologically based approaches have been proposed as more sustainable to manage this species [ 16, 17, 18].
6: In Queensland, a biological control program for parthenium weed was started in the late 1970s and since then, nine insect and two fungi biocontrol agents have been released into that state [ 19, 20].
7: One of the most successful biological control agents is the leaf-feeding beetle ( Zygogramma bicolorata Pallister; Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) [ 21].
8: Although this agent has widely spread within the parthenium weed infestation range, it does not provide a remarkable control alone [ 18].
9: Therefore, the search for alternative non-chemical methods to control parthenium weed has remained a key theme for weed scientists in this part of the world.
