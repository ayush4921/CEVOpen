0: The benefits of increasing species diversity within a grassland-based agroecosystem will include not only the creation of a higher and more stable fodder biomass production but also improved forage quality and palatability [ 26].
1: Other benefits might also include better recycling and retention of soil nutrients, improved soil physical properties and increased community resilience and resistance to further weed invasion [ 26, 29, 30].
2: Thus, increasing a grasslands diversity, especially if achieved with desirable native plants, should be one of the main objectives and ultimately influence the pasture management recommendations.
3: It is also important to note that suppressive plant species may act synergistically with the biological control agents of parthenium weed [ 17, 18, 31, 32].
4: Therefore, the potential of suppressive plants must be explored in a broader integrated management context.
