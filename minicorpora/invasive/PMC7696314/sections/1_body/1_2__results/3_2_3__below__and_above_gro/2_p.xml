<p>The multivariate analysis showed no similarity (i.e., no overlap) between the species composition of the above-ground community created by plant mixture one and the control (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01587-f003">Figure 3</xref>) whereas similarity existed between plant mixture two and the control. When pooling the data from all three vegetation surveys, plant mixture one showed the greatest species composition stability (i.e., similar species composition over time; R = 0.68, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). However, the unsown species were those that contributed the most to this similarity score (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01587-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The sown species green panic (
 <italic>Panicum maximum</italic> Jacq.) and unsown species such as green crumbweed (
 <italic>Dysphania carinata</italic> (R.Br.) Mosyakin &amp; Clemants) and goosegrass (
 <italic>Eleusine indica</italic> (L.) Gaertn.) contributed the most to the dissimilarities between the control and plant mixture one (dissimilarity 55.4%). The sown species siratro and Buffel grass and the unsown species parthenium weed, spiny amaranth and goosegrass contributed the most to the dissimilarities between the control and mixture two (similarity percentage (SIMPER) dissimilarity 52.4%).
