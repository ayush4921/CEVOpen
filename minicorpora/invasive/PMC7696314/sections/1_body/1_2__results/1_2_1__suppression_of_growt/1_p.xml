<p>The parthenium weed populations forming within the two sown plant mixtures were of equal biomass by 30 days after emergence (DAE) as compared to that seen in the control plots, with no obvious suppression of biomass detected (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01587-f001">Figure 1</xref>a). By 60 DAE, however, the weed biomass had been significantly reduced (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in both plant mixtures and the control in comparison to 30 DAE and remained low as the season progressed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01587-f001">Figure 1</xref>a). Unlike biomass production, the abundance of parthenium weed was not identical within the two plant mixtures at 30 DAE (9.8, 8.8 and 4.8 plants m
 <sup>−2</sup> in the control, mixture one and mixture two plots, respectively;

 <sup>−2</sup>; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01587-f001">Figure 1</xref>b) and by 90 DAE the abundance had become significantly reduced (
