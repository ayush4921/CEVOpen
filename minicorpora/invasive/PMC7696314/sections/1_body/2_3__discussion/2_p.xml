<p>The effective suppression of parthenium weed abundance in the field was not only due to the suppressive nature of plant mixture two but also its interaction with a biological control agent, the leaf-feeding beetle [

Occasionally, the biological control agents are quite damaging; however, not all years are climatically advantageous for this insect to act as effectively as it did in 2011. Thus, having competitive perennial species to control parthenium weed over the longer term becomes an important part of the overall strategy. At 30 DAE, the biomass from newly established pasture from both seed mixtures was relatively low and was not yet able to sustain grazing (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01587-f002">Figure 2</xref>), indicating that, in this environment, an establishment period (with the exclusion of grazing) is necessary. The well below average rainfall during November 2011 also contributed to this slow establishment which therefore may have been more rapid in a typical rainfall year.
