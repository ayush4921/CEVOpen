<p>Across vegetation surveys and the susceptibility of the mixtures to weed invasion, the lack of overlap detected for mixture one by the non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis was, to an extent, expected to occur for mixture two. Buffel grass, present in mixture two, can act as an environmental weed [

 <xref rid="B39-plants-09-01587" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. It has, therefore, been one of the most controversial species to be considered for the suppressive management of parthenium weed. However, the value of Buffel grass as a pasture species is well recognized and, as yet, it is not a declared weed in Queensland. From plant mixture one, only green panic became a dominant sown species. The remaining species responsible for the lack of overlap were the unsown broadleaves with no grazing value such green crumbweed, which became more abundant in this mixture than in the control. Mixture one also recorded the lowest forage species evenness at 90 DAE, indicating the domination of just a few, or even a single, species at this time (

This evolution towards a monoculture is certainly not desirable. The dominance of Buffel grass in pasture mixture two was anticipated and therefore a decrease in the evenness was expected. However, this mixture maintained both a steady total and forage species evenness throughout the study period.
