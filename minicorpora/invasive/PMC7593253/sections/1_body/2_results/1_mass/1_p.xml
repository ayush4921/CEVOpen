<p>Plants from introduced populations had a significantly greater stem and leaf mass than those from native populations but their root masses did not differ (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>); thus, they had lower root to shoot ratio (R:S) (introduced: 0.162 ± 0.007; native 0.192 ± 0.007;

 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). From visual inspection, there were no apparent effects of introduction event of an introduced population on any mass variables (GA1 and GA3 vs. rest of introduced populations, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Plants were larger in the August block (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) but there were no significant interactions between the origin and time block or population(origin) and time block (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). However, the incomplete, unbalanced design to populations (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) provided little power to examine the interaction of origin or population(origin) with time block.
