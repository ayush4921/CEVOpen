0: Here we examined the mass and carbohydrate concentrations of roots, stems, and leaves as well as root water potential and AMF colonization in a common garden experiment with plants of Chinese tallow trees ( Triadica sebifera) from China (native range) and USA (introduced range).
1: Specifically, we asked the following questions: (1) How do soluble sugars, starch, and cellulose concentrations vary among leaves, stems, and roots of introduced and native populations?
2: (2) How do their AMF colonization and root water potential differ?
3: We predict that, relative to native populations, introduced populations have a greater allocation to soluble sugars vs. starch and cellulose, higher AMF colonization and more negative root water potentials.
