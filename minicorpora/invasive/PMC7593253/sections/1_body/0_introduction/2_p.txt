0: Furthermore, invasive plant root growth and functioning are affected by the synthesis, allocation, and storage of carbohydrates.
1: Carbohydrates in plant tissues are usually classified as structural or non-structural carbohydrates according to their chemical structure and function in plants ( Dietze et al., 2014).
2: Structural carbohydrates, as non-storage components, are long-chained molecules and mainly include polymerized compounds, such as cellulose which confers mechanical strength to cells, playing important roles in maintaining or changing plant tissue density ( Dumas et al., 2008;  Miedes et al., 2014).
3: Thus, low cellulose concentrations in roots may reduce defense against natural enemies, but facilitate arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) penetrating into roots, increasing AMF colonization.
4: AMF establish symbioses with most terrestrial plants, assisting plants to obtain water and nutrients from the soil by forming a large composite network of root hyphae to expand the absorption area of the host plant roots and increase the root length, and by inducing greater aquaporin expression ( Simard et al., 2012;  Ruiz-Lozano and Aroca, 2017;  Lu et al., 2018).
5: Studies have shown some introduced populations of plants can have higher AMF colonization than native ones ( Nijjer et al., 2008;  Yang et al., 2015a, b).
6: However, it remains unknown whether cellulose concentrations differ between introduced and native populations despite the potential for this difference to play a role in invasion success.
