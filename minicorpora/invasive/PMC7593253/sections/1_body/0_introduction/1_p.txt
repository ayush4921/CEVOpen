0: Successful invasive plants often optimize their performance and competitive ability by improving resource acquisition and use in their introduced ranges ( Zou et al., 2007;  Feng et al., 2009;  Chen et al., 2013;  Liu et al., 2017;  Petruzzellis et al., 2019).
1: However, nearly all studies of variation among native and introduced populations of invasive plants focus on foliar ecophysiology, while knowledge of the roles of root ecophysiological traits in facilitating biological invasion is still limited.
2: Roots play a vital role in determining plant growth, development, and adaptation via water uptake, nutrient acquisition and carbon storage and exudation ( McCormack et al., 2015;  Erktan et al., 2018;  Lu et al., 2018;  Petruzzellis et al., 2019).
3: Whether plants from introduced populations have different root physiological traits compared with congeneric native populations, and whether these differences contribute to the faster growth of invasive plants are largely unexplored.
