0: Non-structural carbohydrates include soluble sugars (such as glucose, sucrose, or fructose) and starch, which serve different physiological functions.
1: Starch is a long-term carbon storage pool because of its osmotic inactivity ( Hartmann and Trumbore, 2016), while soluble sugars are used directly for cellular metabolism, as the substrates of cellular respiration or osmolytes for maintaining plant growth ( Rosa et al., 2009), and provide the energy for AMF colonization ( Lu et al., 2018;  Rodriguez-Caballero et al., 2018).
2: Non-structural carbohydrates can undergo frequent transformations including the conversion of soluble sugar to starch for storage or the conversion of starch to soluble sugar for metabolism.
3: Therefore, tissue soluble sugar and starch maintain a dynamic trade-off between growth (defense, osmoregulation, and symbiosis) and storage ( Dietze et al., 2014;  Hartmann and Trumbore, 2016), which represent different adaptation strategies to various environments.
4: Hinman and Fridley (2018) found that native species have higher root soluble sugar concentrations and employ a grow-first strategy prioritizing allocation to new structural biomass over carbon storage, but invaders tended to store more root starch for new root growth in spring.
5: A cross-continental comparison of sycamore maple ( Acer pseudoplatanus) showed trees from native populations had higher foliar glucose and fructose concentrations than invasive population trees but their sucrose and starch concentrations were similar ( Shouman et al., 2017).
6: To date, however, there are few reports examining the root structural and non-structural carbohydrate traits of introduced and native populations of invasive plants ( Lin et al., 2018).
7: Testing such differences may reveal whether invasive plants shift their root physiological strategies after they are introduced from their home range.
