<p>Non-structural carbohydrates include soluble sugars (such as glucose, sucrose, or fructose) and starch, which serve different physiological functions. Starch is a long-term carbon storage pool because of its osmotic inactivity (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Hartmann and Trumbore, 2016</xref>), while soluble sugars are used directly for cellular metabolism, as the substrates of cellular respiration or osmolytes for maintaining plant growth (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Rosa et al., 2009</xref>), and provide the energy for AMF colonization (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Lü et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Rodríguez-Caballero et al., 2018</xref>). Non-structural carbohydrates can undergo frequent transformations including the conversion of soluble sugar to starch for storage or the conversion of starch to soluble sugar for metabolism. Therefore, tissue soluble sugar and starch maintain a dynamic trade-off between growth (defense, osmoregulation, and symbiosis) and storage (

 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Hartmann and Trumbore, 2016</xref>), which represent different adaptation strategies to various environments. 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Hinman and Fridley (2018)</xref> found that native species have higher root soluble sugar concentrations and employ a grow-first strategy prioritizing allocation to new structural biomass over carbon storage, but invaders tended to store more root starch for new root growth in spring. A cross-continental comparison of sycamore maple (
 <italic>Acer pseudoplatanus</italic>) showed trees from native populations had higher foliar glucose and fructose concentrations than invasive population trees but their sucrose and starch concentrations were similar (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Shouman et al., 2017</xref>). To date, however, there are few reports examining the root structural and non-structural carbohydrate traits of introduced and native populations of invasive plants (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2018</xref>). Testing such differences may reveal whether invasive plants shift their root physiological strategies after they are introduced from their home range.
