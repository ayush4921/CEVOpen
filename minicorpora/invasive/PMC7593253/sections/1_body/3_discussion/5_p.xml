<p>Overall, our results support a scenario in which 
 <italic>T. sebifera</italic> in its introduced range has shifted to a strategy of faster growth, greater aboveground allocation, and more efficient root water absorption potential in part from more positive AMF interactions and more negative water potential. Significantly higher seedling biomass in introduced 
 <italic>T. sebifera</italic> plants suggests that AMF more benefit introduced populations of 
 <italic>T. sebifera</italic> relative to its native populations. The changes in carbohydrates from lower starch and cellulose to higher soluble sugars are consistent with greater resource investment to the growth rate in the introduced range. Because several invasive plant species have such a pattern of more rapid growth in introduced populations (

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Petruzzellis et al., 2019</xref>), such changes in carbohydrates may also have occurred in those invasive plants. This extends our knowledge of physiological variation in root characteristics between ranges for an invasive plant species, though further studies on changes in the belowground structure and function are needed to fully unveil mechanisms involved in the genetic variation of root ecophysiology in invasive plants.
