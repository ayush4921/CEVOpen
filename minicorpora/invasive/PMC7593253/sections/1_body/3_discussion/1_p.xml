<p>Several studies have compared leaf morphological, physiological, and biochemical traits of plants from native and introduced populations (

 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Angelo and Pau, 2017</xref>;

 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Petruzzellis et al., 2019</xref>) but root physiological traits are largely neglected. Root carbohydrate allocation is closely related to plant growth, resource storage, and defense. Here, we found that 
 <italic>T. sebifera</italic> roots of plants from native and introduced populations varied in water potentials, AMF colonization and carbohydrate contents. These findings indicate the differences in those root traits in the introduced range may play a role in the more rapid shoot growth of plants from introduced populations, which helps to better understand the invasion success of this species and likely other plant species.
