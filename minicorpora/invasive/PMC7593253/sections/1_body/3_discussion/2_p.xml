<p>In this study, the greater concentrations of soluble sugars together with lower concentrations of starch and cellulose in 
 <italic>T. sebifera</italic> plants from introduced populations suggest a shift from storage and defense to more rapid metabolism in the introduced range. Our results also support a trade-off between the allocation to soluble sugars and starch, given starch and sugar are often in a dynamic conversion state. Soluble sugars are strongly positively associated with more active tissue metabolism and rapid growth (

 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Thalmann and Santelia, 2017</xref>). Therefore, when the plants had a strong demand to grow, less starch will be synthesized for decreasing energy store, and more sugar will be synthesized for increase metabolic energy. In part, these changes reflect that, for 
 <italic>T. sebifera</italic> plants from introduced populations in this study, more soluble sugar might be associated with the decreasing tissue water potential (i.e., more negative) (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Tardieu et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, cellulose is a macromolecular polysaccharide composed of glucose such that higher cellulose concentrations limit allocation to other types of carbohydrates. The lower cellulose for lower tissue density perhaps also reflects less need for physical defense or lower risk of tissue loss with low enemy abundance in the introduced range (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Hartley et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Fan et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Petruzzellis et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, the patterns we found for carbohydrates could reflect selection for increased soluble sugars for more active metabolism (such as to allow more rapid growth) by decreasing starch for storage at least during the seedling stage in our study.
