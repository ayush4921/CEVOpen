0: We conducted our experiments in Kaifeng, Henan, China.
1: Due to logistical constraints related to measuring root water potentials, we split the experiment into two-time blocks.
2: We filled PVC tubes (24.5 cm high, diameter 6.3 cm; 32 tubes in July and 64 tubes in August 2017) with 630 g of soil and vermiculite (volume 2:1).
3: We collected soil from a field left fallow for three years.
4: We separately collected soil for the July (1.0 g kg 1 total nitrogen, 9.2 mg kg 1 available phosphorous, 178.8 mg kg 1 available potassium, 5.0 g kg 1 organic carbon) and August (1.4 g kg 1 total nitrogen, 14.7 mg kg 1 available phosphorous, 173.7 mg kg 1 available potassium, 10.6 g kg 1 organic carbon) blocks to avoid storing soil.
