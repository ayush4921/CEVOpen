<p>We removed the seeds’ waxy coats (by soaking them in water with detergent then scrubbing), surface sterilized them (HgCl
 <sub>2</sub> [0.1%] for 1 min) and rinsed them repeatedly with distilled water. Then we put them in moist sand at 4°C for ∼30 days. Following this, we sowed ∼300 seeds of each population in a tray filled with a mixture of vermiculite and commercial topsoil that we placed in an unheated greenhouse.
