<p>We planted one seedling (three-leaf stage) into each PVC tube. At each time block we transplanted four seedlings for a population (eight for GL) for mass, carbohydrate and root water potential measurements and another set of four seedlings (eight for GL) in August only for AMF measurements. We randomly arranged tubes in a mesh-sided greenhouse, watered them daily, and changed their positions every other day. Light and temperature approximated ambient conditions. At the beginning of the experiment, all seedlings used were similar in size. We allowed seedlings to grow from July 12 to August 24, 2017 or from August 12 to October 4, 2017.</p>
