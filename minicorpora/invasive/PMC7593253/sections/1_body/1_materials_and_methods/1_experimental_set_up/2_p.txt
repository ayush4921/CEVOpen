0: In the fall of 2016, we hand collected seeds from trees in 10 populations across the native range and 10 populations across the introduced range ( Supplementary Table S1).
1: We collected mature seeds (pods had dehisced to expose seeds) from 6 to 10 widely spaced, haphazardly selected adult trees.
2: We pooled seeds from separate trees within each population.
3: The introduced populations included those descended from the two historically recorded major introduction events ( Pile et al., 2017) along with likely source populations as identified in a microsatellite study ( DeWalt et al., 2011).
4: The Georgia populations are descended from the original introduction in 1772, which was most likely from a Guangdong province population and the rest of the US populations are descended from a later introduction around 1900 most likely from a Jiangsu province population ( DeWalt et al., 2011).
