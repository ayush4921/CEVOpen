<p>We conducted our experiments in Kaifeng, Henan, China. Due to logistical constraints related to measuring root water potentials, we split the experiment into two-time blocks. We filled PVC tubes (24.5 cm high, diameter 6.3 cm; 32 tubes in July and 64 tubes in August 2017) with 630 g of soil and vermiculite (volume 2:1). We collected soil from a field left fallow for three years. We separately collected soil for the July (1.0 g kg
 <sup>–1</sup> total nitrogen, 9.2 mg kg
 <sup>–1</sup> available phosphorous, 178.8 mg kg
 <sup>–1</sup> available potassium, 5.0 g kg
 <sup>–1</sup> organic carbon) and August (1.4 g kg
 <sup>–1</sup> total nitrogen, 14.7 mg kg
 <sup>–1</sup> available phosphorous, 173.7 mg kg
 <sup>–1</sup> available potassium, 10.6 g kg
 <sup>–1</sup> organic carbon) blocks to avoid storing soil.
