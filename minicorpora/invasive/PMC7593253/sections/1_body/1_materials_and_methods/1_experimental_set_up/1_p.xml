<p>Chinese tallow tree (
 <italic>Triadica sebifera</italic>) is native to China and was introduced to the United States in the late 18th century where it has become invasive throughout the southeast (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Pile et al., 2017</xref>). Relative to native conspecifics, introduced populations of 
 <italic>T. sebifera</italic> have more rapid growth, larger leaf area or specific leaf area, greater photosynthetic rates (
