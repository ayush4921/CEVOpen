0: Chinese tallow tree ( Triadica sebifera) is native to China and was introduced to the United States in the late 18th century where it has become invasive throughout the southeast ( Pile et al., 2017).
1: Relative to native conspecifics, introduced populations of  T. sebifera have more rapid growth, larger leaf area or specific leaf area, greater photosynthetic rates ( Zou et al., 2006,  2007;  Chen et al., 2013;  Yang et al., 2015b), higher rates of AMF association ( Yang et al., 2015a, b,  Pei et al., 2020), and greater plasticity of functional and fitness-related traits under salt stress ( Chen et al., 2013;  Zhang et al., 2013;  Yang et al., 2015a).
2: Previous studies have also reported that plants of Chinese tallow tree had higher AMF colonization than several native plant species in the introduced areas ( Nijjer et al., 2008;  Paudel et al., 2014).
