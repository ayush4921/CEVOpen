0: We planted one seedling (three-leaf stage) into each PVC tube.
1: At each time block we transplanted four seedlings for a population (eight for GL) for mass, carbohydrate and root water potential measurements and another set of four seedlings (eight for GL) in August only for AMF measurements.
2: We randomly arranged tubes in a mesh-sided greenhouse, watered them daily, and changed their positions every other day.
3: Light and temperature approximated ambient conditions.
4: At the beginning of the experiment, all seedlings used were similar in size.
5: We allowed seedlings to grow from July 12 to August 24, 2017 or from August 12 to October 4, 2017.
