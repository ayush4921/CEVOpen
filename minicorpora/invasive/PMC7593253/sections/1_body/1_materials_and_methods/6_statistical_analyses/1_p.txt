0: We used a series of ANOVAs (PROC GLM, SAS 9.4) with time block, population origin, population nested in origin and their interactions as fixed factors to examine the variation in mass and carbohydrates of roots, stems and leaves as well as root water potential.
1: We used the variation among populations to test for a significant origin effect and we used the interaction of populations and time block to test for a significant origin by block effect.
2: We conducted an additional ANOVA without any time block terms to examine AMF colonization (only measured in August block).
