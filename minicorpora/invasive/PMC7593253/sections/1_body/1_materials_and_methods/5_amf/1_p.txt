0: We examined AMF on the fine root samples from the other set of plants.
1: We stored each AMF root sample in a histocassette in ethanol until we processed them following the methods of  Nijjer et al.
2: (2004,  2008).
3: We cleared and bleached the roots.
4: Then we acidified and stained them (trypan blue), and slide-mounted 30 1-cm fragment of fine roots (PVA mount).
5: We examined the slides (400 magnification) and recorded the number of 300 grid intersection points at which mycorrhizal hyphae were present.
