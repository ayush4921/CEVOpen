0: Taraxacum officinale is a member of the Asteraceae originally from Europe that has spread worldwide.
1: It is one of the top invasive species around the world  [36].
2: This plant can be found growing in sites with changing climatic characteristics, disturbance regimes, and along a wide range of altitudes and latitudes.
3: Seeds of  T. officinale were collected in five localities: Manta (Ecuador), Trujillo (Peru), La Serena (Chile), Valdivia (Chile) and Punta Arenas (Chile).
4: The hemispheric latitudinal gradient covers from  ca.
5: 0 to  ca.
6: 54 S, including a notorious and significant thermal gradient ( Fig.
7: 1).
8: All seeds were collected at sea level to reduce altitudinal effects ( Fig.
9: 1).
10: Preliminarily, cytogenetic analysis showed that individuals from all localities sampled in this study have the same ploidy level (n = 24 chromosomes) and size of chromosomes, suggesting that all individuals sampled belong to the same species (data not shown).
