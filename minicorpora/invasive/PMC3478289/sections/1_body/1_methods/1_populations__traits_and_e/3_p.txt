0: Seeds from all localities were germinated at 242C on wet filter paper in Petri dishes and planted in 300-mL plastic pots filled with potting soil.
1: First generation plants (F1) were generated from this initial seed pool and were grown in a greenhouse at the Universidad de Concepcion (Concepcion, Chile) under controlled conditions of light and temperature (1320 mol m-2s-155 and 222C, respectively).
2: These plants were again put in 300-mL plastic pots filled with potting organic soil and irrigated every two days with 50 ml of water.
3: After five months these plants produced the achenes that were used to obtain experimental plants (F 2).
4: One week after of appearance of the first true leaf, F 2 seedlings were transferred to growth chambers (Forma Scientific Inc.) with a photon flux density (PFD) of 170 mol m-2 s-1 and 16/8 h light/dark photoperiod.
5: The temperature treatment consisted of transferring 20 individuals from each locality described above to a growth chamber set at 5 or 20C for 90 days.
6: These temperatures were chosen because they are close to the mean temperatures in each extreme of gradient.
7: Plants were irrigated daily and supplemented with Phostrogen (Solaris, NPK, 141027) using 0.2 g L 1 once every 15 days.
8: Plastic pot positions were randomized within the experimental plot every four days.
9: Interplot distances were sufficient to prevent mutual shading.
10: After 90 days we recorded three ecophysiological traits, net photosynthesis, water use efficiency (photosynthesis/foliar transpiration) and foliar angles, and three fitness-related traits (total dry biomass, flower production and seed output).
