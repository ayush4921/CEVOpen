0: A small number of seeds (four to five) per individual plant collected from a relatively large number of sampled plants (5055) per population provided the initial pool of seeds.
1: As  T. officinale has apomictic reproduction  [37], samples were taken from widely separated plants to avoid sampling the same genet twice.
2: Seeds in each locality were collected from 3 populations separated by 1 km each.
3: Finally, all seeds collected in the 3 populations of each locality were pooled and randomized before sorting them into experimental treatments.
4: This was done because the aim of this study was to compare responses in a number of genotypes from different localities growing along the latitudinal gradient rather than to isolate genotypic effects from phenotypic effects  [33],  [38].
5: No specific permits were required for seed collection in the localities sampled in this study and confirm that all populations are not privately-owned or protected in any way.
6: Additionally, we confirm that the field studies did not involve endangered or protected species.
