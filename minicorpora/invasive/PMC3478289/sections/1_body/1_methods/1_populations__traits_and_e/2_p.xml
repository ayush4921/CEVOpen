<p>A small number of seeds (four to five) per individual plant collected from a relatively large number of sampled plants (50â€“55) per population provided the initial pool of seeds. As

 <xref rid="pone.0047620-Vaut1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, samples were taken from widely separated plants to avoid sampling the same genet twice. Seeds in each locality were collected from 3 populations separated by 1 km each. Finally, all seeds collected in the 3 populations of each locality were pooled and randomized before sorting them into experimental treatments. This was done because the aim of this study was to compare responses in a number of genotypes from different localities growing along the latitudinal gradient rather than to isolate genotypic effects from phenotypic effects

 <xref rid="pone.0047620-Schlichting1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. No specific permits were required for seed collection in the localities sampled in this study and confirm that all populations are not privately-owned or protected in any way. Additionally, we confirm that the field studies did not involve endangered or protected species.
