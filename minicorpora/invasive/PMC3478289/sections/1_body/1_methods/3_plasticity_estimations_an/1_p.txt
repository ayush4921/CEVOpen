0: Phenotypic plasticity was considered as the environmentally-induced change in the expression of phenotypic traits at the end of the experimental period, whatever the mechanistic causes (e.g., ontogenetic, allometric) behind this differential expression  [39].
1: Phenotypic plasticity was estimated for each trait and locality as the percentage of change in mean trait value from one environment to the other; that is, P = [(X 20 X 5)/X 20] * 100, where P is plasticity, X 20 is the mean trait value at 20C and X 5 is the mean trait value at 5C  [40].
2: In addition, a measurement of overall plasticity was estimated for each population as the arithmetic average of the percentage of change observed for all the traits.
3: A bootstrapping procedure, with 1000 iterations was used in order to obtain error estimations of plasticity for each trait and population (i.e., a percentage of change was calculated from two randomly selected individuals, one in each temperature treatment, in each iteration).
4: The error estimation for overall plasticity was calculated as the arithmetic mean of the errors obtained for all the traits.
5: The relationships between mean trait values at each temperature and trait plasticity with geographic latitude and climatic variables were evaluated separately using the Pearson product moment coefficient.
