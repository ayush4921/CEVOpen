<p>The present study shows that the prediction of the climatic variability hypothesis appears to hold for plant species, finding a strong positive relationship between phenotypic plasticity and geographic latitude. As discussed, this result could have very profound implications on future species persistence under a scenario of climate change. In addition, obtained data support the idea that the great invasiveness ability reported for 
 <italic>T. officinale</italic> along broad gradients could be related with both, to being a weedy r-selected species and to having high plasticity levels for several ecophysiological and fitness-related traits.
