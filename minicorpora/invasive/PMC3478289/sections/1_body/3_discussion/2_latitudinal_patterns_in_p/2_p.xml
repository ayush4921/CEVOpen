<p>On the other hand, reported data suggest that latitude is a better predictor of phenotypic plasticity than climatic variables. This result, usually reported in macrophysiological studies [e.g., 19, 44, 45], appears to be related to at least three different facts 
 <xref rid="pone.0047620-Naya3" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. First, latitude is probably a better predictor of long-term regimes of climatic variables than current climate values provided by weather stations. Second, latitude is correlated with several other climatic, ecological, and historical factors that could affect phenotypic plasticity. Third, the smooth variation of climatic variables in space suggests that latitude may represent a weighted variable of climatic conditions acting over spatial scales more similar to those at which adaptation is expected to occur. In any case, recent studies evaluating the effect of latitude and climatic variability on phenotypic plasticity for areas where both sets of variables are not directly correlated have found that climatic variables, and not latitude, were the best predictors of phenotypic plasticity

Thus, as stated by the CVH, climatic variability appears to be the proximal cause behind the latitudinal patterns in phenotypic plasticity. Thus, phenotypic plasticity can play an important role both in invasive and native plant species along gradients

 <xref rid="pone.0047620-Pichancourt1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. For example, Santamar√≠a et al. (2003) 
 <xref rid="pone.0047620-Santamara1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> showed the positive role of phenotypic plasticity in aquatic plants across a latitudinal gradient. Additionally, Mou et al. 2012 
 <xref rid="pone.0047620-Mou1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, demonstrated that plasticity in morphological and physiological traits would improve the performance and resource acquisition in environmental variability conditions.
