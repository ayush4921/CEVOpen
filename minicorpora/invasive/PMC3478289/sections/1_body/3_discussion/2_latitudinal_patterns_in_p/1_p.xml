<p>As mentioned above, the present study demonstrates for the first time in a plant species the occurrence of the latitudinal pattern of phenotypic plasticity predicted by the CVH. Moreover, correlation coefficients (ranging between 0.84 and 0.99) support the idea that latitudinal patterns in plasticity maybe stronger in plants than in animal species 
 <xref rid="pone.0047620-Ghalambour1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The positive relationship between plasticity and latitude was due to a slight increase (or no change) in trait values with latitude at 5°C but a strong increase at 20°C. This result is logical from a biological point of view, since: (1) Environmental temperatures of 5°C are close to monthly mean temperatures in high latitude localities such as Punta Arenas and Valdivia, but are far from monthly temperatures (even from monthly minima) in the other localities (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047620-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Thus a selective advantage associated with an increase in trait values at this temperature should only be expected in the former localities. In line with this idea, it should be noted that the only traits that did not change with latitude were foliar angle and water use efficiency, i.e., traits for which a rise in mean values with latitude probably do not represent a selective advantage. (2) Environmental temperatures of 20°C are higher than monthly maxima in Punta Arenas, close to monthly maxima during four months in Valdivia and during seven months in La Serena, close to the monthly mean in Trujillo, and close to the monthly minima in Manta (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047620-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Thus, a temperature of 20°C is probably associated with the short favourable season at middle and high latitudes, but only with normal or even unfavourable conditions at lower latitudes. Consequently, positive selection for higher trait values at this temperature is expected to be very strong in high latitude localities, but only weak (or null) in low latitude localities. It has been proposed that populations growing along latitudinal gradients in its poleward limit of distributions should show a trade-off between cold resistance and growth, thus any amelioration in thermal stress conditions will be positive for these populations, improving their ecophysiological performance compared with other populations distributed at lower latitudes (see 
 <xref rid="pone.0047620-MolinaMontenegro3" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Unfortunately, our experimental design did not contemplate environmental temperatures greater than 20°C, for which a strong positive selection for higher traits values may be expected for all the localities. Thus, it is possible that the inclusion of a higher temperature (e.g., 30°C) in the experimental setup could attenuate the strong latitudinal pattern for plasticity reported here.
