0: However, contrasting with the central role of phenotypic plasticity in population persistence, standard models aimed to predict the effect of climatic change on species distribution (i.e., the climate envelope models) do not allow for the inclusion of differences in plastic responses among populations.
1: Obviously this is not a fanciful constraint; the quantification of plasticity for several traits in several populations is a difficult task, and thus available data in this regard are still very scarce (e.g., provenance tests).
2: An encouraging pathway that would trade-off the large amount of data needed to include differences in plastic responses among populations (of each species to be modeled) with the fairly low predictive power of current climate envelope models  [5], is the identification of global patterns in phenotypic plasticity, which could be easily incorporated into the models if they exist.
