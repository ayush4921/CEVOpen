0: An important gap that still remains in our knowledge is the direct applicability of the CVH to plant species.
1: On theoretical grounds there are two contrasting ideas about how plant species should change with geographic latitude to cope with the environment.
2: On one hand, the limited vagility of plants may result in a great degree of adaptation to local conditions, resulting in a great population differentiation, which could preclude the existence of a latitudinal pattern in trait plasticity  [29] [31].
3: On the other hand, the limited vagility of plants may imply a reduced ability to avoid environmental influences, and thus the pattern predicted by the CVH could be more clearly observed than in animal species  [10],  [32].
4: Although some studies have been conducted to assess the relationship between plasticity and climatic heterogeneity in plant species  [33] [35], to the best of our knowledge no empirical study has evaluated the validity of CVH in these organisms.
