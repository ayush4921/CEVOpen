0: Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to analyze how plasticity for several ecophysiological and fitness-related traits changes with latitude in the invasive  Taraxacum officinale (dandelion complex).
1: Specifically, we evaluated plasticity due to differences in environmental temperature (5 and 20C) in photosynthetic rate, water use efficiency, foliar angles, plant biomass, number of flowers and seed output in five populations that occur along a latitudinal gradient (from 0 to 54S).
2: We predicted that the reduction in the duration of the growing season observed at higher latitudes should determine that populations at higher latitudes will be more efficient at exploiting favorable thermal conditions (20C) than populations from lower latitudes.
3: Additionally, we predicted that higher thermal heterogeneity at higher latitudes should determine that populations at higher latitudes would be more plastic.
4: Thus we expect to observe, in agreement with the CVH, a positive relationship between phenotypic plasticity and geographic latitude.
