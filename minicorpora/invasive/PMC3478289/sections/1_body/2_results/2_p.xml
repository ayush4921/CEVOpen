<p>Neither annual rainfall nor rainfall seasonality were correlated with plasticity for any trait (

In any case, the number of significant correlations between any single climatic variable and trait plasticity was always less than those observed for latitude, and moreover, latitude was by far a better predictor of overall plasticity than any climatic variable (
