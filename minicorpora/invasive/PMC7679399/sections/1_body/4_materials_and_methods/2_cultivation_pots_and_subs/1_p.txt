0: Plants were grown in 2-L pots (11  11  20 cm, w  d  h) lined with a plastic mesh (1.2 mm opening) at the bottom, sterilized with 96% ethanol and filled with a potting substrate.
1: The substrate consisted of thoroughly mixed (volume-based) 10% -irradiated (> 25 kGy) field soil from Litomerice, Czechia (N503154.53 E14067.10), 45% autoclaved zeolite MPZ 125 from Zeopol ( www.zeolity.cz, grain size 12.5 mm), and 45% autoclaved quartz sand (grain size < 3 mm).
2: For physicochemical properties of the substrate see 67 or Supplementary Table  S1.
