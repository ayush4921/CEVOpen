0: The experiment consisted of two harvest times (64 and 91 days after target plants were planted) to assess the effects of disturbance across time.
1: The shoots of all target plants were cut at the hypocotylroot interface and subsequently dried for 3 days at 65 C to determine shoot dry weight (hereafter called plant biomass).
2: The roots were washed from the substrate under cold tap water, weighed, and cut into 1.5 cm fragments.
3: The roots were then divided into three sections.
4: One section was immersed in 50% ethanol to determine AM fungal colonization.
5: The second was kept in the freezer at  20 C for molecular analyses.
6: The last section was weighed, dried, and weighed again; fresh to dry weight ratio was determined and total root dry weight was calculated for each root system.
