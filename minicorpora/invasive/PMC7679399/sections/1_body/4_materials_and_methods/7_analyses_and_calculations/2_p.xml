 </sup>, [with minor modifications]. Roots from each collected sample were cut into 2-cm-long segments and placed in processing cassettes (customized scintillation vials). Root pieces were cleared in 10% KOH at 80 °C for 30 min in a water bath. Cleared pieces of roots were rinsed with tap water to remove KOH, and roots were immersed in 1% HCl at room temperature for 30 min followed by heating at 80 °C for 15 min. Roots were rinsed with tap water and stained with 0.05% trypan blue by incubation at 30 °C for 30 min. Root fragments were then transferred to vials containing lactoglycerol to allow excess stain to leach from roots. Stained root samples were stored in lactoglycerol solution for at least 48 h before being mounted on microscopic slides. One hundred root intersections were scored per sample.
