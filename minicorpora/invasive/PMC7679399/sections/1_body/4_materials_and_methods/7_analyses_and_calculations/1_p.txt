0: To evaluate mycorrhizal benefits provided by AM fungi to the plant, shoot dry biomass and P content were assessed.
1: To determine P mass fraction in aboveground plant tissues, 100 mg of a milled sample of each shoot was incinerated in a muffle furnace at 550 C for 12 h, the ashes were dissolved in 1 ml of concentrated (69%, w:v) HNO 3 and briefly boiled (250 C) on a hot plate.
2: The extracts were then transferred into volumetric flasks (50 ml) through ashless filter paper (Whatman 41, P-lab, Prague, Czechia) and ultrapure water added for a final volume of 50 ml.
3: Orthophosphate concentration in the extracts was measured using the malachite green method 72.
4: P content per shoot (hereafter referred as plant P content) was calculated from the measured nutrient mass fraction in shoots using the dry biomass of the shoots.
