<p id="Par27">One pair of invasive-native mycorrhizal herbaceous plant species (family Asteraceae) was used in this study. We selected 
 <italic>Echinops sphaerocephalus</italic> L., a common invader of semi-natural plant communities in central Europe (Czechia), and 
 <italic>Inula conyzae</italic>, an indigenous herb which occurs abundantly in invaded plant communities. Prior to planting native and invasive species, both M+ and M− treatments were preplanted with 
 <italic>Festuca pratensis</italic> Huds. 
 <italic>F. pratensis</italic> served as a nurse plant to establish CMNs in M+ pots that were not associated with either the invasive or native plant species. All seeds were field collected. To account for possible genotypic differences among individuals, we selected seeds from at least 10 individuals per plant species of few plant populations, mixed the seeds and randomly distributed among different treatments. Seedlings were pre-germinated for two weeks in Petri dishes on wet filter paper at room temperature. Pots were directly sown by seeds of 
 <italic>F. pratensis</italic> in the middle of January. After 48 days, half of the pots were once mechanically disturbed by inserting a long metallic spatula to its full depth into the central part of the pot (from one empty corner to the other avoiding nurse plants). Microscopic assessment of soil samples (following

 </sup>. Target seedlings were transplanted into pots (two individuals per pot—either two 
 <italic>I. conyzae</italic>, or one 
 <italic>I. conyzae</italic> paired with one 
 <italic>E. sphaerocephalus</italic>) immediately after soil disturbance. Target plants (
 <italic>E. sphaerocephalus</italic> and 
 <italic>I. conyzae</italic>) were planted into the two empty corners of each pot (i.e. corners not occupied by 
 <italic>F. pratensis</italic>) Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Target plants in M+ treatments were planted into non-disturbed soil with intact CMNs, or into initially disturbed soil, where CMNs needed to reestablish from spores and hyphal fragments. Thirty-six days following the initial disturbance and planting of target plants, shoots of all nurse plants were cut under the hypocotyl–root interface and dried for 3 days at 65 °C and weighted.
