<p id="Par26">Half of the pots (M+) were supplemented with 36 g of mycorrhizal inoculum. The inoculum consisted of potting substrate containing root fragments of leek (

 <italic>v</italic>). The other half of the pots (M−) received 36 g nonmycorrhizal (mock) inoculum. The mock inoculum consisted of potting substrate containing root fragments of leek from a previous pot culture grown under the same conditions and for the same period of time as the M+ pot cultures (above) but without AM fungi. The inocula were added 4–5 cm beneath the surface of the potting substrate.
