0: Half of the pots (M+) were supplemented with 36 g of mycorrhizal inoculum.
1: The inoculum consisted of potting substrate containing root fragments of leek ( Allium porrum L.), which had been used as a host plant in previous pot cultures of  Rhizophagus irregularis (N.C. Schenck & G.S.
2: Sm.)
3: C. Walker & Schuessler (2010) BEG 158,  Claroideoglomus claroideum (N. C. Schenck & G. S.
4: Sm.)
5: C. Walker & Schuessler (2010) BEG 155, and  Funneliformis mosseae (T.H.
6: Nicolson & Gerd.)
7: C. Walker & Schuessler (2010) BEG 161.
8: BEG is an abbreviation for the International Bank for the Glomeromycota ( www.i-beg.eu).
9: The three monospecific inocula were mixed in the volume ratio 1:1:1 ( v: v: v).
10: The other half of the pots (M) received 36 g nonmycorrhizal (mock) inoculum.
11: The mock inoculum consisted of potting substrate containing root fragments of leek from a previous pot culture grown under the same conditions and for the same period of time as the M+ pot cultures (above) but without AM fungi.
12: The inocula were added 45 cm beneath the surface of the potting substrate.
