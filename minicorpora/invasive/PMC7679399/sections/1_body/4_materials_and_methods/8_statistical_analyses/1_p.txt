0: Analyses of variance (ANOVA) with  P < 0.05 as the significance cutoff level were calculated in the R 3.6.3 statistical environment (R Core Team, 2013,  https://www.R-project.org/) after checking for data conformity with ANOVA assumptions (i.e., normality and homogeneity of variances).
1: Plant biomass and plant P content were log-transformed before the analyses.
2: Three-way ANOVAs with factors mycorrhizal inoculation, community assembly and soil disturbance were performed on biomass and plant P content of the native plant species either growing in monocrops or paired with the respective invasive plants.
3: The average biomass and P content of monocrops per cultivation pot were used when assessing the effect of plant invasion on native plants biomass.
4: Three-way ANOVAs with factors mycorrhizal inoculation, soil disturbance and plant harvest were performed on native plant share (i.e., fraction of the total assignable to the native plant contribution) in the per-pot summed values of total plant biomass and plant P content.
5: Three-way ANOVAs with factors community assembly, soil disturbance and harvest were performed on AM fungal taxon abundances (measured by qPCR) of the native plant species.
6: Three-way ANOVAs with factors plant species, soil disturbance, and harvest were performed on AM fungal taxon abundances of the native plant species and paired invasive plant.
7: When appropriate, post-hoc comparisons were carried out using Tukey HSD tests.
8: Mean values and standard errors per treatment combination are presented.
