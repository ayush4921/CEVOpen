<p id="Par22">The effects of AM fungi on invasive plant growth and P status recorded in our study indicate that AM fungi can play an important role in invasive plant competitive success. However, decreases in abundance of AM fungi followed by decreases in mycorrhizal benefits in 
 <italic>I. conyzae</italic> growing in competition with invasive 
 <italic>E. sphaerocephalus</italic> do not support the ‘
