<p id="Par9">While AM fungal structures were present in roots of all M+ plants (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>), microscopic observation confirmed that no root samples of M− plants contained AM fungal structures. Following the second harvest, the abundances of 
 <italic>F. mosseae</italic>, 
 <italic>C. claroideum</italic>, and 
 <italic>R. irregularis</italic> in the roots of 
 <italic>I. conyzae</italic> were significantly (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.033, 0.011, 0.005 × 10
 <sup>−2</sup>, respectively) lower when grown with the invasive (multicrops) (7,164,400 ± 1,610,100 CN mg
 <sup>−1</sup>, 5420 ± 2869 CN mg
 <sup>−1</sup>, 196,989 ± 45,104 CN mg
