 <italic>enhanced mutualism hypothesis’</italic>. We selected mycorrhizal plant species 
 <italic>Echinops sphaerocephalus</italic> commonly invasive to central Europe and conducted a coexistence (intercropping) experiment to determine if feedbacks between AM fungi, invasive plant species, and native plant species (
 <italic>Inula conyzae</italic>) play a role in successful invasions by the non-native (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). We hypothesized that (i) presence of AM fungi enhances success of a mycotrophic invader in competition with a domestic plant—AM fungi preferentially support plant growth and nutrition of the invasive plant, with a concomitant reduction in native plant growth and nutrition, (ii) competitive advantage of the mycotrophic invader provided by AM fungi is in initial growth phases more pronounced in non-disturbed than in disturbed environments, where (compared to non-disturbed environment) it increases with time.
