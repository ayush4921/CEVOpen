0: Two main hypotheses have been proposed to explain the role of mycorrhizal fungi in plant invasions, both of which are based on the invasive plants interacting differently with AM fungi relative to native plants: (i) the  degraded mutualism hypothesis 51 and (ii) the  enhanced mutualist hypothesis 52.
1: The degraded mutualism hypothesis indicates invasive plants either do not form AM (e.g., Brassicaceae or Proteaceae), or are poorly colonized with low dependency on AM fungi in its new range, thereby suppressing AM fungal abundance.
2: By doing so, invasive plants strongly affect mycorrhizal symbiosis of native mycorrhizal plants, often reducing native plant competitiveness 46,  53.
3: (ii) The  enhanced mutualist hypothesis 52 indicates invasive plants receive greater benefit from the symbiosis than native plants, altering native AM fungal communities and increasing invasive species competitiveness 50,  52,  54,  55.
4: Therefore, invasive plants in their new range may parasitize local CMNs, deriving disproportionally large benefits compared to their symbiotic costs at the expense of competing native plants.
5: CMNs have been shown to preferentially transfer mineral nutrients ( 15N and P) to an invasive plant, with less transferred to the native species 56.
6: CMNs mediation of invasive and native plants may be crucial to the understanding of invasion success or naturalization of an invasive plant and concomitant spread : these aspects of invasion have not currently been widely studied.
