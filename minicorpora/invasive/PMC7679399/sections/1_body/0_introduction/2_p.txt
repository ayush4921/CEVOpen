0: AM mycelium often interconnects two or more plant individuals of the same or different species, establishing arbuscular (common) mycorrhizal networks (CMNs; 13.
1: These CMNs play an important role in the long-distance transport of nutrients through soil ecosystems and redistributing symbiotic benefits and costs within a plant community 14.
2: Therefore, CMNs affect the survival, fitness, and competitiveness of their hosts, regulate plant coexistence 15  20, and maintain plant community diversity 21 and, therefore, ecosystem stability.
3: Importantly, host plants have been shown to disproportionately distribute C among fungal partners according to fungal benefits (e.g., nutrient supply rates) 14,  22,  23.
4: Similarly, CMNs may distribute nutrients among plant partners according to their C supply 4,  24.
5: The partitioning of mineral nutrients acquired via CMNs among neighboring plants and the associated C costs are likely to influence both plant competition and facilitation 19,  20.
