0: Because it has been shown that the majority of invasive plants are mycotrophic 41,  57,  58 and able to establish mycorrhizal associations in the secondary range 49, our current study will focus on the  enhanced mutualism hypothesis.
1: We selected mycorrhizal plant species  Echinops sphaerocephalus commonly invasive to central Europe and conducted a coexistence (intercropping) experiment to determine if feedbacks between AM fungi, invasive plant species, and native plant species ( Inula conyzae) play a role in successful invasions by the non-native (Fig.
2: 1).
3: We hypothesized that (i) presence of AM fungi enhances success of a mycotrophic invader in competition with a domestic plantAM fungi preferentially support plant growth and nutrition of the invasive plant, with a concomitant reduction in native plant growth and nutrition, (ii) competitive advantage of the mycotrophic invader provided by AM fungi is in initial growth phases more pronounced in non-disturbed than in disturbed environments, where (compared to non-disturbed environment) it increases with time.
