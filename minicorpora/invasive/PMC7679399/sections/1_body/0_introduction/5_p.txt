0: The majority of studies describing underlying mechanisms for successful invasion have focused on above- rather than belowground processes, however accumulating evidence suggests soil organisms may be important regulators of plant invasions 37  40.
1: Although many invasive plants are mycotrophic (~ 82% 41, and fungal associations have been shown to both facilitate and hinder invasion success 42  50, the role of AM mycelial networks in the invasion process has not been determined.
2: Further, information on the role of mycorrhizae on invasive plant success is available for only a small number of plant species at this time.
