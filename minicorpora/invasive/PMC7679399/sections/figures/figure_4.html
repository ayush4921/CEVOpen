 <caption> Shoot dry biomass and shoot P content of the native plant species Inula conyzae following the second harvest, as affected by mycorrhizal inoculation (M+: mycorrhizal inoculum added; M−: nonmycorrhizal control), community assembly i.e., plant combination (invasive-native: invasive and native plant growing in competition; native-native: only native plants of the same species growing together) and initial soil disturbance (disturbed: substrate in the pot disturbed before target plants inserted; non-disturbed: target plants planted into non-disturbed substrate, resulting in non-disturbed CMNs of M+ pots) after the second harvest. Bars represent means accompanied by standard errors (n = 5). Different letters above individual bars within vertical dashed lines indicate significant differences between means at P &lt; 0.05. </caption>
