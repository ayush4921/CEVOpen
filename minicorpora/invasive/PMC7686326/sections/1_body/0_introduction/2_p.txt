0: Grasslands, which comprise approximately 40% of Earths natural vegetation 9, contain a substantial amount of the worlds SOC 10.
1: In addition, they provide habitat for a substantial diversity of animals and plants and support other ecosystem services (ES), including the regulation and storage of water flows, forage for livestock production, and tourism 11, thereby contributing substantially to the livelihoods of over one billion of people worldwide 12,  13.
2: Yet, grasslands are under severe threat from degradation and conversion to other land uses 14, which limits their potential to provide these essential services and functions.
3: Degradation of grass-dominated ecosystems and the concomitant loss of SOC and other ES is particularly prevalent in arid and semi-arid regions in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) due to a set of interlinked factors, including a growing population, overgrazing, invasion by alien plant species 15 and a lack of appropriate policies 16 among others.
