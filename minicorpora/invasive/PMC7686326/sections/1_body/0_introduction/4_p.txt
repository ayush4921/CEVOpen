0: Here we assessed the impact of grassland degradation and 2535 years of either encroachment of the invasive alien tree  Prosopis juliflora (Sw.) DC (hereafter referred to as  Prosopis) or grassland restoration on SOC, biodiversity and herbaceous biomass in Baringo County, a tropical semi-arid region in Kenya.
1: Prosopis, which is native to Central America, was introduced into various countries in Eastern Africa in the 1960s and 1970s in an attempt to combat land degradation and to provide additional services, such as firewood and fodder for livestock 30.
2: Soon after its introduction,  Prosopis started to spread out from the plantations and to invade surrounding habitats, including grasslands 31.
3: We quantified soil organic carbon stocks (down to 1 m belowground), plant species richness and herbaceous biomass in pristine grassland, degraded grassland, grassland moderately and heavily invaded by  Prosopis, and in restored grassland in Baringo County.
4: We hypothesized that i) SOC decreases with increasing soil depth but that this pattern varies among land cover types, ii) restoration of grasslands is as effective in carbon sequestration as  Prosopis forest, and iii) grassland restoration, in contrast to  Prosopis encroachment, also promotes fodder for livestock production and biodiversity, thus avoiding carbon-fodder or carbon-biodiversity trade-offs.
