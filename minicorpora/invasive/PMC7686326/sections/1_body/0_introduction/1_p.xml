<p id="Par2">Soils are the largest terrestrial carbon reservoir containing more carbon than vegetation and the atmosphere combined

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>
 </sup>, is sensitive to land degradation
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>
 </sup>, with significant negative consequences for soil quality and productivity and an exacerbation of greenhouse gas emissions
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>
