0: Soils are the largest terrestrial carbon reservoir containing more carbon than vegetation and the atmosphere combined 1.
1: Moreover, they present a relatively stable carbon stock, as compared to the more transitory carbon stock in woody biomass 2.
2: Yet, soil organic carbon (SOC), which makes up about two thirds of global soil carbon 3, is sensitive to land degradation 4, with significant negative consequences for soil quality and productivity and an exacerbation of greenhouse gas emissions 5.
3: Since halting land degradation and restoring degraded soils and their associated services is essential for building agro-ecological systems that meet global development goals 6,  7, the management of soil resources will have wide-ranging consequences on human well-being for generations to come 8.
