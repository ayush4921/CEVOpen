<p id="Par21">In Baringo County, human population growth, land use changes and unsustainable grazing management, combined with communal land tenure system and a lack of enforcement of land use rights, have led to large-scale degradation of grasslands and other ecosystems, with serious consequences for biodiversity and the provisioning of multiple ES

 <italic>. Prosopis</italic> was planted at multiple sites in Baringo to mitigate the challenges of desertification, including sand storms, and to provide services such as wood and fodder for livestock

 </sup>. However, 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> started to escape from the plantations and to invade degraded land as well as cropland, semi-natural ecosystems and protected areas in the surroundings, and this invasion process is ongoing in Baringo

 </sup> as well as in other parts of Sub-Saharan Africa

 </sup>. In both Baringo, Kenya and Afar Region, Ethiopia, over 30% of the grasslands present in the mid-1980s have disappeared and are now covered by

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>
 </sup> i.e. it can also invade undisturbed habitats
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>
 </sup>. However, the rapid invasion in Eastern Africa is likely to be further promoted by land degradation as well as by regular and seasonal migration of livestock and severe flooding events, which both contribute to seed dispersal
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>
 </sup>. Climate change effects such as increasing frequencies of drought events may further accelerate Prosopis invasion since their deep-reaching roots allow them to tap groundwater in areas where most native species cannot
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>
 </sup>. Also, rising atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have been shown to promote the growth of woody C3 plants over C4 grasses in the African savannas
