<p id="Par23">Our results provide evidence that the replenishment of the SOC stocks through restoration of degraded grasslands can be achieved within 20–30 years and does not lead to multiple trade-offs with biodiversity or ES. Restoration of grasslands also increased fodder almost to the level of pristine grasslands, a key ecosystem service for the many pastoralist and agro-pastoralist communities inhabiting grasslands in Sub-Saharan Africa. In line with our findings, Mureithi et al.

 </sup>, showed that the restored grasslands in Baringo, which were managed as communal enclosures, provide a source of income through the sale of fattened livestock, harvested grass seeds, hay, honey and charcoal, and that total enclosure income increased with time. The extent to which grassland restoration will increase primary productivity and SOC will depend on socio-economic factors, including land tenure systems and enforcement of land use rights, affecting the level and type of grazing management. A report by Byrnes et al.

 </sup> showed that grasslands with rotational grazing had SOC stocks higher than those of grasslands with continuous grazing and comparable with those of grasslands with no grazing. Moreover, and in contrast to encroachment by
