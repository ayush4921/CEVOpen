<p id="Par16">The other significant difference among land cover types in total SOC stocks was between degraded and restored grasslands. Notably, 30 years of grassland restoration led to an increase in SOC in all soil depth increments, including the depth increment at 60–100 cm. At the COP21, the ‘4 per 1000 – Soils for Food Security and Climate’ initiative was launched to promote mitigation of climate change through the annual increase in soil organic carbon by 0.4% in the top 30–40 cm of agricultural, grasslands, pastures and forest soils

 </sup>. The difference between degraded and 30 years old restored grasslands in our study area correspond to an average annual increase in total SOC of 1.4% ([SOC in restored grasslands – SOC in degraded grasslands]/years since restoration started) in both the top 30 cm as well as in the top meter, which is significantly above the goal of the ‘4 per 1000′ initiative. Our higher values of annual increase are in line with the findings by Corbeels et al.

 </sup>, that SOC storage rates under conservation agriculture and multistrata agroforestry systems are actually higher than the set goal of 0.4%. Increases in SOC due to restoration of degraded grasslands in semi-arid and arid regions of Africa have also been reported by Chaplot et al.

 </sup> (27% increase in 3 to &gt; 20 years old grassland exclosures in West Pokot County, Kenya). It is notable that seventeen of the twenty countries in the world with more than 70% of grassland area are found in Sub-Saharan Africa

 </sup> and nearly a quarter of sub-Saharan Africa contains land classified as ‘severely degraded’

 </sup>. Thus, while grasslands in semi-arid and arid regions may have a lower potential to sequester SOC than wetlands when expressed on a per-unit-area basis
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>
 </sup>, sustainable grassland management is likely to play a key role for SOC storage in Sub-Saharan Africa due to the very large area of this ecosystem and thus for climate change mitigation. For example, assuming an accumulation rate of SOC of 1.4% (as estimated for the restored grasslands in this study), the restoration of the currently over 8,500 ha of severely degraded land in the Njemps Flats, Baringo County, would translate into an annual sequestration of C of approx. 3,700 tons C over the next 30 years.
