<p id="Par8">When adjusting %SOC to the different depths of soil increments, %SOC figures to one meter depth were highest in pristine grasslands, followed by restored grasslands, and lowest in degraded grasslands (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Similarly, total SOC to 1 m depth was strongly influenced by land cover type (
