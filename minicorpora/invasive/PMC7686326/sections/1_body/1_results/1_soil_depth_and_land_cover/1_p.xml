 <sub>4, 58</sub> = 7.72, p &lt; 0.001) and to a lesser extent also in deeper soil layers (31–100 cm: F
 <sub>4, 58</sub> = 3.15, p = 0.021). Highest values for %SOC and SOC per volume in the top layer were found in pristine grassland and

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref> online). Both %SOC and SOC per volume declined with increasing soil depth down to 1 m (Supplementary Figures

 <italic>Prosopis</italic>-high (62% each) and pristine grasslands (54% and 49%, respectively), while the smallest reductions occurred in degraded (26% and 30%, respectively) and restored grasslands (30% and 33%, respectively). Overall, the largest variation in %SOC and SOC per volume across land cover type was found in the surface soils (0–15 cm).
