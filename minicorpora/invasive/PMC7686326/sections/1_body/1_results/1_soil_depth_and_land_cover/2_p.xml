<p id="Par7">Soil bulk density was strongly affected by land cover type (F
 <sub>4, 58</sub> = 5.11, p = 0.001). It was highest in pristine grasslands, intermediate in restored and degraded grasslands and lowest in 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> invaded plots (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The effect of soil depth on bulk density was not consistent (F
 <sub>3, 174</sub> = 1.55, p = 0.204), but varied among land cover type (interaction effect: F
 <sub>12, 174</sub> = 2.48, p = 0.005; Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref> online). While bulk density in pristine grasslands increased with increasing soil depth, it decreased or showed no consistent trend in the other land cover types (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref> online).
