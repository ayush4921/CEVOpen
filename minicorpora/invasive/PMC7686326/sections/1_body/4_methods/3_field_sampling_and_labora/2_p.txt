0: At each selected site, one plot of 15  15 m was randomly selected and geo-referenced.
1: Within the pristine and the restored grassland sites, plots were randomly established in areas with contiguous, undisturbed grass cover (i.e.
2: driveways or gullies were excluded) and with a minimum distance of 30 m away from a native tree and 50 m from a  Prosopis tree or thicket if present.
3: In total, soil samples, plant species richness and herbaceous biomass were analysed in 63 plots (pristine grassland: 10, degraded grassland: 16,  Prosopis-low: 12,  Prosopis-high: 10, restored grassland:15; Fig.
4: 3).
5: Soil sampling was carried out during the dry season (SeptemberNovember 2017 & 2018).
6: Sampling during the non-growing season minimizes the influence of plant type and growth stage on SOC, particularly in soil carbon fractions that turn over rapidly 98.
7: Plant diversity and herbaceous biomass sampling occurred during the second half of a wet season at plant peak biomass (April-July 2017 & 2018).
