<p id="Par32">A preliminary assignment of sites within the study region to the five land cover types was made based on a recently published land use/land cover map. The final decision whether a pre-selected site was sampled or not was taken after inspection of the site in the field and consultation with local people. The selected sites of all land cover types were located in the same geographic region with similar topography, elevation and edaphic characteristics. The patchy distribution of the land cover types in Baringo enabled us to select replicates of the categories that were spatially well interspersed (Fig.Â
