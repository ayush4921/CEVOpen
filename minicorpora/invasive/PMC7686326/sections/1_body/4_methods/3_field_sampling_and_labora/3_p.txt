0: The plot design and sampling procedure for all the variables is described in Linders et al.
1: 64.
2: In brief, each 15  15 m plot was divided into nine 5  5 m subplots and samples taken from five out of the nine subplots (the four corner subplots and the centre subplot).
3: One of these five subplots was randomly excluded from sampling herbaceous biomass and fenced against livestock grazing in degraded and  Prosopis invaded plots.
4: We did not find significant differences in herbaceous biomass between fenced and unfenced subplots (TEW Linders, unpublished data).
5: To measure soil organic carbon (SOC), a soil pit was dug incrementally in the centre of each of the corner subplots, from which 4 independent soil cores were taken at the following depth increments: 015 cm, 1530 cm, 3060 cm and 60100 cm 99.
6: For bulk density, a soil pit was dug incrementally in the centre subplot, outside of the fenced area if applicable, and three soil cores taken from three different sites of the same soil pit at each of the same depth increment.
7: Species richness was assessed at the plot level.
8: Herbaceous vegetation (anything growing 2 cm above-ground) samples were harvested from a patch area of 25  50 cm of each of the four subplots, pooled together per plot, and oven-dried to determine dry weight 64.
9: Herbaceous biomass samples were analysed at the Kenya Forestry Research Institute (KEFRI-Nairobi) and the soil samples at the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization (KALRO-Kenya).
10: SOC was determined using the colorimetric method 100.
11: Bulk density samples were oven-dried, weighed and measured using the procedure described by Klute 101.
12: Bulk density was used to convert the SOC concentration to ecosystem estimates of organic carbon stocks per unit area or soil volume.
