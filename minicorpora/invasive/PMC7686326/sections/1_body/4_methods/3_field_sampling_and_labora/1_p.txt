0: A preliminary assignment of sites within the study region to the five land cover types was made based on a recently published land use/land cover map.
1: The final decision whether a pre-selected site was sampled or not was taken after inspection of the site in the field and consultation with local people.
2: The selected sites of all land cover types were located in the same geographic region with similar topography, elevation and edaphic characteristics.
3: The patchy distribution of the land cover types in Baringo enabled us to select replicates of the categories that were spatially well interspersed (Fig.
4: 3).
