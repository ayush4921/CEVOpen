<p id="Par31">The five different land cover types were classified as follows: i) pristine grasslands with &gt; 80% grass cover and a history of predominant grass cover for over 70 years; ii) degraded grasslands, i.e. areas with predominantly barren ground for over 70 years; iii) restored grasslands, some 25–35 years old; iv) 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic>-invaded areas with &lt; 30% 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> cover; and v) 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic>-invaded areas with &gt; 80% 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> cover. 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic>-low and 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic>-high were invaded some 10–15 years and 25–35 years ago, respectively. Pristine grasslands were characterized by a long history of grass cover, moderate grazing intensity and comprised a mixture of indigenous grasses and shrubs. They were moderately grazed because historically, the pastoralists reserved them as dry season grazing areas and hence carefully regulated grazing during critical seasons

 </sup>. Restored grasslands were barren land which was originally re-seeded with a variety of native grass species, namely;

 </sup> for reseeding degraded lands in Kenya. All restored grasslands sites were protected from unauthorised grazing by solar-powered electric fencing. Degraded grasslands were areas with largely barren soil and the plots were selected from communal grazing areas which markedly suffered from severe droughts in the periods before and during the 1950s, 1965

 <italic>Prosopis</italic>-invaded areas were previously degraded grassland and the plots for 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic>-high were selected in areas with the longest history of invasion in the study area, i.e. since the 1980s or early 1990s

 <italic>Prosopis</italic> invasion, respectively. These 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> cover thresholds were determined using a 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> fractional cover map for the study area (Mbaabu et al., unpublished results).
