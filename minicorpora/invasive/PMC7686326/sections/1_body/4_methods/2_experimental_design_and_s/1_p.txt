0: Five land use/cover types representing common earth cover and distinct land use activities within the study area were identified, namely pristine grasslands, degraded grasslands,  Prosopis-low (low cover),  Prosopis-high (dense cover) and restored grasslands (reference photos in Fig.
1: 3).
2: The choice of these land cover types, their categorization and definitions were based on time, events in history and physical characteristics as informed by expert judgement, literature and field observations.
3: We achieved this through consultations with village leaders, farmers, pastoralists, land-owners and conservationists regarding the happenings and changes in the area since 1950s or before.
4: Reference is made to around 1950s because the region suffered a catastrophic drought  an aftermath of prolonged rainfall failure following the usual seasonal bushfires that occur in savannas and rangelands 88.
5: Coupled with stocking and grazing by pastoralists, large parts of the study area have become severely degraded 59,  83.
