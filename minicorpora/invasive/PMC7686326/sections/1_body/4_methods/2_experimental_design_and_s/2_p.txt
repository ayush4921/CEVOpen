0: The five different land cover types were classified as follows: i) pristine grasslands with > 80% grass cover and a history of predominant grass cover for over 70 years; ii) degraded grasslands, i.e.
1: areas with predominantly barren ground for over 70 years; iii) restored grasslands, some 2535 years old; iv)  Prosopis-invaded areas with < 30%  Prosopis cover; and v)  Prosopis-invaded areas with > 80%  Prosopis cover.
2: Prosopis-low and  Prosopis-high were invaded some 1015 years and 2535 years ago, respectively.
3: Pristine grasslands were characterized by a long history of grass cover, moderate grazing intensity and comprised a mixture of indigenous grasses and shrubs.
4: They were moderately grazed because historically, the pastoralists reserved them as dry season grazing areas and hence carefully regulated grazing during critical seasons 85.
5: Restored grasslands were barren land which was originally re-seeded with a variety of native grass species, namely;  Cenchrus ciliaris (L).
6: 89,  Enteropogon macrostachyus (Hochst.
7: ex A.
8: Rich.)
9: Munro ex Benth.
10: 90,  Eragrostis superba (Peyr).
11: 91,  Cymbopogon pospischilii (K.
12: Schum.)
13: C.E.
14: Hubb.
15: 92 and  Sehima nervosum (Rottler) Stapf 93, and experienced moderate grazing pressure, coupled with seasonal harvesting of grass seeds and above-ground biomass.
16: Most of the grass species used are among those recommended by Bogdan and Pratt 94 for reseeding degraded lands in Kenya.
17: All restored grasslands sites were protected from unauthorised grazing by solar-powered electric fencing.
18: Degraded grasslands were areas with largely barren soil and the plots were selected from communal grazing areas which markedly suffered from severe droughts in the periods before and during the 1950s, 1965 95  97 and later; and have been unsustainably grazed over time.
19: Prosopis-invaded areas were previously degraded grassland and the plots for  Prosopis-high were selected in areas with the longest history of invasion in the study area, i.e.
20: since the 1980s or early 1990s 31.
21: We sampled areas with a cover of below 30% and above 80% for plots with a low and high level of  Prosopis invasion, respectively.
22: These  Prosopis cover thresholds were determined using a  Prosopis fractional cover map for the study area (Mbaabu et al., unpublished results).
