0: All data were analyzed using R 102, version 3.6.3.
1: We checked for normality and homogeneity using ShapiroWilk`s tests and by visual inspections of residuals against fitted values and histograms.
2: Data that violated basic model assumptions were log-transformed prior to the analysis.
3: To assess the effect of soil depth on percent SOC and on SOC per volume soil (g cm -3) across land cover types, we fitted linear mixed effect model using the  lme function within the  nlme package 103.
4: We included land cover, soil depth and the interaction of land cover and soil depth as fixed effects in the model, and plot as random factor.
5: Differences between the means among land cover types and soil depths were evaluated with Tukey`s HSD Post-hoc test on the model`s least square means.
6: To assess land cover effects on SOC down to 1 m depth, species richness and herbaceous biomass, we applied general linear models with land cover type as fixed effect, followed by Tukey`s HSD Post-hoc test.
7: Estimates of SOC stocks per unit area (t C ha -1) were computed using the formula: SOC t ha -1 = %SOC x BD (g cm -3) x d (cm), where %SOC = carbon concentration of the sample, BD = bulk density in g cm -3, and d = height of the depth increment (cm) 98,  104.
8: Total carbon stocks down to 1 m depth were then obtained by summing up the SOC tons per hectare values estimated for each depth increment 24,  105.
9: To determine which species are characteristic for the different land cover types, we conducted an indicator species analysis test using the  labdsv package.
