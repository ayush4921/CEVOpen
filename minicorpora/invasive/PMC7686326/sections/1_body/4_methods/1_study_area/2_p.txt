0: During the last 300 years, Baringo has experienced severe land degradation, particularly in the lowland areas 57  59,  83.
1: This problem was further exacerbated by rapid accumulation of livestock by resident households from 1900 onwards 57.
2: Over the centuries, the situation remained unchanged, eventually culminating in acute scarcity of basic ecosystem goods and services 15.
3: This prompted the introduction of  Prosopis species in these lowland areas between 1982 and 1983 through the Fuelwood Afforestation Extension Project 60 to mitigate firewood scarcity and desertification 60.
4: Due to its invasive nature,  Prosopis rapidly spread from the initial plantations to the surrounding areas and currently covers over 18,000 ha of land, of which more than 5000 ha used to be barren land at the time  Prosopis was introduced in Baringo County 31.
5: This tree has also encroached some previously productive land such as grasslands, croplands and other native vegetation with adverse implications for biodiversity and rural livelihoods 31.
6: For instance, the current estimate of the remaining patches of pristine grassland is about 21 ha, while it covered approximately 7000 ha in the mid-1980s 31.
