 </sup>. Over the centuries, the situation remained unchanged, eventually culminating in acute scarcity of basic ecosystem goods and services
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>
 </sup>. This prompted the introduction of 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> species in these lowland areas between 1982 and 1983 through the Fuelwood Afforestation Extension Project

 </sup>. Due to its invasive nature, 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> rapidly spread from the initial plantations to the surrounding areas and currently covers over 18,000 ha of land, of which more than 5000 ha used to be barren land at the time 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> was introduced in Baringo County

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>
 </sup>. For instance, the current estimate of the remaining patches of pristine grassland is about 21 ha, while it covered approximately 7000 ha in the mid-1980s
