<p>The United Nations has declared 2021â€“2030 as the decade of ecological restoration. Taking cue from this, it is imperative to undertake effective restoration and management strategies for invaded habitats, especially which are ecologically fragile and socio-culturally important. Globally multi-scale programs (local, regional, national, and international) are in place to reduce existing and potential future impacts caused by IAS. The approaches range from low impact practices, involving only removal of invasive species by myriad of manipulative treatments aimed at reducing the presence, abundance, or impacts of invasive species and favoring native species, to massive exercises of reintroducing native species [
