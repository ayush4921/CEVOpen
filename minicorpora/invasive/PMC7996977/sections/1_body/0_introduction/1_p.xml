<p>The growing anthropogenic pressures on natural ecosystems that drive immense biodiversity loss globally, hamper the functioning of ecosystems and their ability to provide essential services [

 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] characterize the Anthropocene. Nearly one-sixth of the global land area, including significant areas of developing economies and global biodiversity hotspots are currently highly vulnerable to invasion by alien species [
 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Rapidly spreading invasive alien species (IAS) seriously threaten the global environment in view of multitude of undesirable impacts on invaded communities, especially by displacing native species [
 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The IAS have been not only linked to biodiversity loss [
 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] but also to changes in ecosystem functions, including nutrient and carbon regulation [

 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], primary productivity [
 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and soil microbial processes [
 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It is a well-established fact that the plant species richness and functional diversity increases local net primary productivity, principally through more exploitation of resources, or niche complementarity [
 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, contrary to the diversity-productivity experiments, alien plant invasions create a paradox by increasing the local net primary productivity [
 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and reduces native plant diversity in the invaded communities, often to the extent of becoming like monotonous stands [
 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Rather than depleting soil resources as productivity increases, invasions often increase soil stocks, pools and fluxes of nitrogen through processes regulated by microbial communities [
 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. A meta-analysis of 94 studies revealed that the average increase in annual net primary productivity was over 80% in invaded ecosystems [
