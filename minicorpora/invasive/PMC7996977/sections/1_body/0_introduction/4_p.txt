2: Though in Kashmir valley at present it shows constrained distribution in the peripheries of tourist spots, meadows and forest openings [ 24], it is recognized globally as high-altitudinal invasive species and places endemic diversity and life-supporting ecological services in these regions at high risk [ 24,  25].
