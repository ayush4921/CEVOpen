0: The growing anthropogenic pressures on natural ecosystems that drive immense biodiversity loss globally, hamper the functioning of ecosystems and their ability to provide essential services [ 1,  2] characterize the Anthropocene.
1: Nearly one-sixth of the global land area, including significant areas of developing economies and global biodiversity hotspots are currently highly vulnerable to invasion by alien species [ 3].
2: Rapidly spreading invasive alien species (IAS) seriously threaten the global environment in view of multitude of undesirable impacts on invaded communities, especially by displacing native species [ 4 8].
3: The IAS have been not only linked to biodiversity loss [ 9 11] but also to changes in ecosystem functions, including nutrient and carbon regulation [ 12,  13], primary productivity [ 14] and soil microbial processes [ 15].
4: It is a well-established fact that the plant species richness and functional diversity increases local net primary productivity, principally through more exploitation of resources, or niche complementarity [ 16].
5: However, contrary to the diversity-productivity experiments, alien plant invasions create a paradox by increasing the local net primary productivity [ 13,  17] and reduces native plant diversity in the invaded communities, often to the extent of becoming like monotonous stands [ 18].
6: Rather than depleting soil resources as productivity increases, invasions often increase soil stocks, pools and fluxes of nitrogen through processes regulated by microbial communities [ 19].
7: A meta-analysis of 94 studies revealed that the average increase in annual net primary productivity was over 80% in invaded ecosystems [ 13].
