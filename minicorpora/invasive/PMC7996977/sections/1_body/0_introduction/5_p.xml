<p>Despite being a global invader,

 <italic>vulgare</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Therefore, we deemed it imperative to understand the impacts of this global invader on the structure and functioning of the invaded communities, and formulate and implement effective invasion management strategies through ecological restoration of invaded habitats in otherwise immaculate landscapes such as Gulmarg in Kashmir. To date, management of 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> has been mostly relied upon chemical and mechanical approaches with rather erratic success. Hand pulling, grubbing, and hoeing have been proved effective in controlling small, isolated populations of
