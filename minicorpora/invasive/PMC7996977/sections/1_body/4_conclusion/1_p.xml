 <italic>Leucanthemum vulgare</italic>, a high altitudinal invasive species, has a huge impact on endemic species found in subalpine mountainous ecosystems across globe. It forms dense and quite extensive populations in pastures, which are generally avoided by grazing cattle and even other herbivores. This species is relatively ineffective in preventing soil erosion because of its shallow root system. It also inhibits grass regeneration due to its allelopathic nature. Present study revealed that 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> invasion reduces native plant diversity to the point where it appears the only plant species present in the invaded habitats in the form of rather monotonous stands. However, decrease in ecological diversity indices in invaded, as compared to the control plots, is associated with concomitant increase in net primary productivity. The increased net primary productivity by invasive plants is generally attribute to their high nitrification potential in the soil, ability to access and use resources more efficiently than the native plant, and a strategy to generally avoid the grazers and herbivores. This is more alarming in view of its impacts on ecosystem processes and functions. Given the impact of 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> invasion on ecosystem functions, out of the multiple approaches for its management attempted, uprooting before it blossoms and produces seeds seems to be an important strategy. But it must be continued until the soil seed bank is depleted. Another easy way to control 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> is combined digging and mowing of the plants followed by treatment with herbicides such as Aminopyralid in combination with 2, 4 D. This checks the emergence of new plants from the seed bank and rhizomes as well. To completely eradicate 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> these approaches, however, need to be continued for some years. Nevertheless, there is need for further research to examine in detail the effects of selective herbicides on native vegetation. As a special case a very targeted application of selected herbicides, especially on completely large monoculture stands of 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> only, could be considered in combination with other approaches. In the long run the best approach, however, should be avoiding the use of chemical herbicides and instead encourage and upscale the alternative approaches. Though we did not explore the option of biological control, association of 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> with many insects, viruses, and pathogens in native range [
