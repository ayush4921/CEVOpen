<p>Significant differences in ecological indices across invaded and uninvaded plots in both the sites indicate that invasion by 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> reduced species diversity by exerting significant negative impact on natural communities through displacement of native species. Doing so, it brings about discrepancy in structure, composition and functioning of the invaded communities resulting in formation of its large apparent monocultures. This trend is in accordance with a study carried out on this species recently [
 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and well corroborated by other studies too [
 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The possible reason for the strong negative impact on species diversity by 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> can be its rapid and vigorous growth and fast reproductive potential [
 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], that allows it to attain a high cover and form much taller stands as compared to the native co-occurring species in the invaded communities [
 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In apparently looking monoculture stands of 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> the number of individuals of other species was very minimum. The reproductive success of 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> as an invasive species may be amplified by its ability to exert competitive influence via allelopathy as five potential allelopathic compounds, such as caprolactam, nonanoic acid, dihydroactinidiolide, dibutyl phthalate, and tetracosane, were isolated recently from this species [
 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Allelopathy can also be attributed to the negative impacts of 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> on species diversity as these volatile oil containing compounds with herbicidal properties in the flowering parts of this plant can lead to its successful invasion [
 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].
