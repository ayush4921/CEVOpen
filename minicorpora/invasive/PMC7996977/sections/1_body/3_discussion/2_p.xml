 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. To assess sampling completeness, rarefaction curves plotting cumulative number of species as a function of sampling effort were used which indicated that sampling was reasonably complete (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246665.g012">Fig 12</xref>). The ordination (nMDS) and ANOSIM showed significant differences between species assemblages of invaded and uninvaded plots. The difference was significant for both study sites but the greatest dissimilarity between invaded and uninvaded plots were noticed in Gulmarg. This study is in agreement with the previous study [
 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] where the similarity percentages (SIMPER) test showed an overall compositional dissimilarity of 65.16% between invaded and uninvaded plots. SIMPER analysis showed dominance of fewer species in invaded plots than in uninvaded plots. These are
