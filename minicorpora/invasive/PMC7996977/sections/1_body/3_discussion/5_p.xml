<p>Herbicide treatment at seedling stage, before flowering and after flowering stages killed all the

 <italic>vulgare</italic> plants but many of its new individuals come up again from the rhizomes and soil seed bank. After two years of treatment application, although many of the co-occurring species were seen in the invaded plots but their abundance declined as the cover of 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> growing from the rhizomes increases. So, these treatments were not efficient enough to eradicate 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> completely or in recruiting co-occurring species to the invaded plots. Herbicide plus mowing treatment resulted in restoring few co-occurring species but again these were over competed by the 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> plants that emerged from rhizomes. Overall co-occurring species richness was greater when 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> was removed with hand-weeding i.e., in 
 <italic>Leucanthemum</italic> uprooting treatment, compared to other treatments. 
 <italic>Leucanthemum</italic> uprooting also proved to be efficient in reducing the 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> cover and restoring the abundance of co-occurring species in the invaded plots. Manual deweeding is considered better than mechanical deweeding as the later clips the plants from above only and due to over-compensatory growth come up even more vigorously. After 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> removal, the remaining plants after release of competition show obvious advantage in terms of their growth in cover and abundance. Pertinently, uprooting has been recommended for the control of 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> by other studies [
 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Manual uprooting also has been seen effective in many other alien invasive species such as 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> that can be easily hand pulled [
 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Likewise, removal of invasive forb 
 <italic>Impatiens glandulifera</italic> from riparian areas in the UK resulted in greater species recruitment [
 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. A study [
 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] recommended mowing of 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> invaded meadows once the first flowers appear, primarily to check the further production and spread of seeds as an effective strategy. Though uprooting will help to prevent seed spread, but it will be difficult to remove the entire rootstock from the ground [
 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The remaining rootstock sprout and new seedlings emerge from the soil seed bank. Thus, follow-up treatments are needed where a persistent seed bank or rhizomes continues to exist. To manage the problem, chemical herbicide treatment seems an option as herbicides such as aminopyralid, metsulfuron, picloram or 2,4-D have been found to temporarily suppress 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] in meadows. However, the use of herbicides also cannot be the only way to achieve long-term management of 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> in view of its other environmental implications. Nevertheless, mowing + herbicide + digging treatment, in our case not only suppressed the germination from soil seed bank but proved to be efficient in increasing the species richness, evenness and diversity compared to all other treatments. Our study is supported by fact that mowing stimulates rosette formation [
 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] which improves the herbicide contact when applied to 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Further support is provided by the studies [

 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] which suggests that soil loosening by digging remove the standing broom seedlings and seedling germinate from the seed bank. In an experiment in central Alberta provided almost complete control on 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> by using several types of herbicides such as, Metsulfuron (18 g a.i. ha–1) +2,4-D ester (0.56 kg a.i. ha–1) and Picloram (0.54 kg a.i. ha–1) [
 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Similarly, in western US rangelands the herbicides, such as 2,4-D (2.24 kg a.i. ha–1) and picloram (0.14 kg a.i. ha–1) were found to control 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> in pastures for 2 to 3 year [
 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Analogously, we used Aminopyralid in combination with 2, 4 D herbicide before flowering, which was quite efficient and effective, in agreement with the earlier studies [
 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] that recommended use of 2,4-D (2.07 kg a.i. ha–1) and 2,4-D (2.07 kg a.i. ha–1) + clopyralid (30 g a.i. ha–1) for the effective control
