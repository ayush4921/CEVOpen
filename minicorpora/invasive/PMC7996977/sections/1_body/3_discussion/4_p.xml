<p>After being introduced to Kashmir 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> is now widespread here, especially in the picturesque Gulmarg region. Based on the climatic and biological requirements of the weed from the literature, the forecast is bleak, with possibly forest areas and alpine zones being quite vulnerable to invasion unless a strategy is formulated and implemented soon. Hence, assessment of effectiveness of different types of treatments for ecological restoration of invaded habitats is imperative. Coincidentally, all treatments we tried significantly increased species richness of the invaded habitats. Our results indicate that the restoration treatments used do stimulate the native plant communities as revealed by the variation in species richness and diversity, invasive plant cover and co-occurring species cover between treatment and reference plots.
