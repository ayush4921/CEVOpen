<p>Plant species diversity increases local net primary productivity through more exploitation of resources as revealed by many diversity-productivity experiments [
 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Interestingly our results indicate that plant invasion results in increase in net primary productivity but decreases local species diversity, which is in agreement with a study [
 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] where plant invasion is associated with dramatic increase in the net primary productivity as compared to uninvaded communities. The potential explanation for increased net primary productivity in invaded communities is that plant invasion is often associated with increased nutrient pulse, especially nitrogen concentration and nitrification potential in the soil [

 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] with Ammonia Oxidizing Bacteria (AOB) are quite pertinent drivers of increased nitrification and soil NO

 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This is supported by the study [
 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], where 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> invaded plots had higher soil nitrogen concentration as compared to uninvaded plots. Other study [
 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] also reported that 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> exhibited the best ability to utilize available resources, resulting in significantly greater biomass than the other species tested under the same conditions. Increased productivity of invaders may also be due to lower predation or disease rates [
 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and interestingly 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> is generally avoided by grazing cattle [
