<p>An important outcome from this study is effectiveness of the methods evaluated for restoration indicating a step in the right direction in mitigating the invasion impact. If the most effective treatments are continued for few more years, instead of just two years of treatment, the results promise to be of great value to the managers of such landscapes. The results of this study have an important gap filling value vis-Ã -vis scientific and practical knowledge in finding the best methods to control invasive plant species. However, the effectiveness of every management plan depends entirely on the leadership of the organization responsible for taking action, its ability to support the funding required, the implementation of a management plan and the involvement and commitment of the authority such as Gulmarg Development Authority, Government of Jammu and Kashmir in this case. Any delay in the management of alien invasive species raises the management costs and reduces the possibility of eradication, as these invasive species do spread rapidly and take over the landscapes. Therefore, preventing the introduction and monitoring the presence and expansion of alien invasive species is the most effective way to safeguard and manage ecosystems from their negative impacts.</p>
