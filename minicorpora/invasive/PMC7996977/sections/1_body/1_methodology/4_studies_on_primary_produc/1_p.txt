0: For studying the impact of  L.  vulgare on net primary productivity same experimental settings were used as for diversity analysis.
1: We estimated aboveground and belowground net primary productivity at the target sites by measuring peak standing above- and below-ground biomass, respectively in both invaded and uninvaded plots.
2: We harvested all plant biomass produced in the current year within each 0.25 m 2 plot by clipping at ground level [ 14].
3: The biomass was oven dried at 72C for 72 hours and weighed.
4: Belowground biomass was measured by soil core method [ 32].
5: Plots were selected and marked at the center for sampling below ground biomass.
6: 510 cm soil core were drilled into the soil and soil was collected along with the roots.
7: Roots were separated and thoroughly washed with tap water.
8: Roots collected were oven dried for the estimation of dry weight at 70 C to a constant weight for 8 hours.
9: Dry weight of roots was estimated for the volume of core sampler (calculated from its diameter and depth) for all sampled plots.
10: Root biomass was then extrapolated to per plot basis using dry weight of the root samples.
