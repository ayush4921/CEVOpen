 <italic>vulgare</italic> on net primary productivity same experimental settings were used as for diversity analysis. We estimated aboveground and belowground net primary productivity at the target sites by measuring peak standing above- and below-ground biomass, respectively in both invaded and uninvaded plots. We harvested all plant biomass produced in the current year within each 0.25 m
 <sup>2</sup> plot by clipping at ground level [
 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The biomass was oven dried at 72°C for 72 hours and weighed. Belowground biomass was measured by soil core method [
 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Plots were selected and marked at the center for sampling below ground biomass. 5–10 cm soil core were drilled into the soil and soil was collected along with the roots. Roots were separated and thoroughly washed with tap water. Roots collected were oven dried for the estimation of dry weight at 70˚C to a constant weight for 8 hours. Dry weight of roots was estimated for the volume of core sampler (calculated from its diameter and depth) for all sampled plots. Root biomass was then extrapolated to per plot basis using dry weight of the root samples.
