<p>The focal species for the present study was 
 <italic>Leucanthemum vulgare</italic>, a diploid species native to Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial forb belonging to family Asteraceae that primarily reproduces by seeds, although rhizomes also contribute to its propagation. The plant is a prolific seed producer and a single, healthy, robust plant may produce up to 26,000 seeds. Germination occurs throughout the growing season, and new seedlings appear in autumn quickly after seed dispersal, but most new seedlings emerge in the spring when conditions are favorable.
