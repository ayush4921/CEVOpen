0: For invasion impact analysis, above and belowground net primary productivity were calculated for uninvaded as well as for invaded plots.
1: The above values were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) to compare difference in above and belowground productivity with invasion status and sites.
2: Linear regression was carried out to find the relation between species richness and net primary productivity under the scenario of plant invasion.
