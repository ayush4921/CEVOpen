0: We used non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis (NMDS) to assess the potential impact of  L.  vulgare on species composition.
1: Abundance data pooled across sites was subjected to NMDS based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix to account for variation in the species composition by invasion status (invaded vs uninvaded).
2: Prior to NMDS, we excluded the rare species that occurred in only one or two quadrats from subsequent analysis [ 36,  37].
3: Also, we excluded  L.  vulgare from the analysis, as our aim was to examine the variations in the species composition as a result of invasion by  L.  vulgare.
4: The range of clustering of sites and plots in response to invasion were assessed by analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) and similarity percentage (SIMPER).
5: ANOSIM relates mean difference of ranks between and within groups, generating the Global statistic (R).
6: Since the values of Global statistic (R) range from -1 to +1, values approaching 0 and negative values indicate similarity among groups and values approaching +1 indicate a strong dissimilarity among groups [ 38,  39].
7: SIMPER identified species contributed most to average dissimilarity between groups (invaded and uninvaded plots).
8: This technique calculates average impact of each species contributing to dissimilarity between groups [ 40 42].
9: Values of percentage similarity between groups range from 0 to 100, with 100 stating maximum similarity.
10: Therefore, to estimate the amount of variation in the community composition and to identify species contributing to those differences we performed similarity percentage test (SIMPER) [ 41,  42].
11: The analysis was carried using the PAST software.
