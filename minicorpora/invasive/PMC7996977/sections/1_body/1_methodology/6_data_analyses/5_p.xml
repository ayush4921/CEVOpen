<p>To understand the effectiveness of different treatment approaches for 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> control, we compared the reference plots with the treatment plots before and after 2 years of treatments, in terms of response variables like 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> cover percentage, co-occurring species cover percentage, species richness, species evenness and Shannon diversity index (H). We used ANOVA, to find the differences in these response variables between reference plots and the treatment plots. This will allow us to find the best treatment approach that shows the significant differences from the reference plots.
