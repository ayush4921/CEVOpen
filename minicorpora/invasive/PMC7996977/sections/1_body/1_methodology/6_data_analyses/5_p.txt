0: To understand the effectiveness of different treatment approaches for  L.  vulgare control, we compared the reference plots with the treatment plots before and after 2 years of treatments, in terms of response variables like  L.  vulgare cover percentage, co-occurring species cover percentage, species richness, species evenness and Shannon diversity index (H).
1: We used ANOVA, to find the differences in these response variables between reference plots and the treatment plots.
2: This will allow us to find the best treatment approach that shows the significant differences from the reference plots.
