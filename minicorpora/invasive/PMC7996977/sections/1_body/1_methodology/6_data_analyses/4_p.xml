<p>For invasion impact analysis, above and belowground net primary productivity were calculated for uninvaded as well as for invaded plots. The above values were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) to compare difference in above and belowground productivity with invasion status and sites. Linear regression was carried out to find the relation between species richness and net primary productivity under the scenario of plant invasion.</p>
