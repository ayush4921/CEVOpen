0: We identified 10m x 10m plots ( Fig 1) with at least 50% cover of  L.  vulgare (hereafter referred as the invaded plot) adjacent to a plot of the same size with no  L.  vulgare (uninvaded plot), as determined by visual estimation.
1: Both the invaded and uninvaded plots were matched for elevation, aspect, slope, and landscape position to minimize difference in confounding environmental factors.
2: The invaded and uninvaded plots were separated by a 5m to 15m buffer strip [ 5].
3: In each plot 10 1m 2 quadrats ( Fig 1) were randomly laid down, surveyed and sampled for vegetation in mid-June, mid-August, and mid-October during the years 2018 and 2019.
4: All the herbaceous vascular plant species, seedlings of shrubs and tree species rooted within each quadrat were noted.
5: The percentage of  L.  vulgare cover, co-occurring species cover, litter cover, bare ground percentage, individual count and height was monitored.
6: Species were identified with the help of standard taxonomic literature [ 30,  31] followed by the expert consultation.
