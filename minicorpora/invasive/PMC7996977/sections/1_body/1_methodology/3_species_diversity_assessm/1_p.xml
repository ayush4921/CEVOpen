<p>We identified 10m x 10m plots (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246665.g001">Fig 1</xref>) with at least 50% cover of 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> (hereafter referred as the invaded plot) adjacent to a plot of the same size with no 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> (uninvaded plot), as determined by visual estimation. Both the invaded and uninvaded plots were matched for elevation, aspect, slope, and landscape position to minimize difference in confounding environmental factors. The invaded and uninvaded plots were separated by a 5m to 15m buffer strip [
 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In each plot 10 1m
 <sup>2</sup> quadrats (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246665.g001">Fig 1</xref>) were randomly laid down, surveyed and sampled for vegetation in mid-June, mid-August, and mid-October during the years 2018 and 2019. All the herbaceous vascular plant species, seedlings of shrubs and tree species rooted within each quadrat were noted. The percentage of 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> cover, co-occurring species cover, litter cover, bare ground percentage, individual count and height was monitored. Species were identified with the help of standard taxonomic literature [

 <xref rid="pone.0246665.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] followed by the expert consultation.
