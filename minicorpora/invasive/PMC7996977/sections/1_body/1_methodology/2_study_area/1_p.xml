<p>The study was carried out in a high-altitude mountainous region of the valley of Kashmir called Gulmarg (2600 m asl) with a picturesque landscape comprising of coniferous forests dominated by Blue Pine (
 <italic>Pinus wallichaina</italic>) and alpine meadows. The climate is predominantly temperate type with wet and cold winters and relatively dry and hot summers. The average temperature during summer is 17.6 
 <sup>o</sup>C and winter isâ€”4.4 
 <sup>o</sup>C. The target species chosen for the present study (
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic>) together with some other alien species have taken over a significant part of the Gulmarg landscape forming apparently monotonous stands thereby affecting the scenic view of this famous tourist spot, besides inducing huge ecological problems.
