<p>A total of 67 plant species from 55 genera were documented during the study. Of these, a total of 59 species were recorded in uninvaded plots compared to 45 in species in 
 <italic>Leucanthemum</italic> infested plots. Mean species diversity and richness was higher in un-invaded than invaded plots (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246665.g002">Fig 2</xref>). This was corroborated by comparison of ecological indices reflecting significant difference between invaded and uninvaded plots (
 <xref rid="pone.0246665.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). However, the impact of 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> invasion didn’t vary much between the two study sites. Invaded plots harbored on an average 8.66±1.45 (mean ± SD, n = 10) species per m
 <sup>2</sup> as against 14.77±4.39 species per m
 <sup>2</sup> in uninvaded plots. So uninvaded plots harbored 6.11±2.92 more species than invaded plots and the difference was statistically significant (t = -5.59, df = 20.67, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.004). The number of species per plot also varied between sites with a significant difference (f = 9.78, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.004). Uninvaded plots as compared to invaded plots exhibited higher values of Shannon index of diversity by a difference of 1.03±0.365, and the difference was significant (t = -8.32, df = 33.43, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001). Similarly, uninvaded plots also exhibited higher values of Simpson index of dominance by a difference of 0.33 ± 0.125; species evenness by 0.16± 0.15; and species richness by 0.76±0.425 (
 <xref rid="pone.0246665.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). For individual sites, 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> invasion had significant impacts on diversity indices except species evenness at site 2, i.e., Drung (
