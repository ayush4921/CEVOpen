<p>Before treatments, as expected in a randomized experiment, treatment plots and invaded reference plots were not different from each other. However, the data collected during two years of annual treatments indicating a significant effect on diversity indices and total cover of target plant and co-occurring species in treated as against untreated plots are presented here. For instance, while comparing the response variables of treatment plots with the untreated reference plots after two years of experimentation, we found all treatments significantly increased species richness but it remained almost unchanged in invaded as well as uninvaded reference plots. Species richness increased in all treatment plots with highest richness recorded in
