 <caption>
  <p>Ordination plots of Bray‐Curtis dissimilarities illustrating differences in composition between garlic mustard ambient (red) and garlic mustard weeded (purple) treatments for (a) mycorrhizal and (b) non‐mycorrhizal plant communities. Shapes represent different plots, plot 1, down‐pointing triangle; plot 2, square; plot 3, diamond; plot 4, up‐pointing triangle; plot 5, circle. Symbols are plot means with 95% confidence intervals for data collected every other year over 11 yr (2006–2016). Garlic mustard data was excluded from PERMANOVA and ordinations. Mycorrhizal plant communities differ significantly between treatments while non‐mycorrhizal plant communities did not.</p>
