 <caption> Graphical representation of garlic mustard treatment efficacy. Values are garlic mustard abundance (measured as percent cover; mean ± SE) in ambient (red circles) and weeded (purple triangles) treatments (2006–2016). Jittered data points for each plot in gray. The first year of garlic mustard weeding occurred after data collection in 2006. Vertical gray dashed line separates pre‐treatment (2006) from post‐treatment abundance values. </caption>
