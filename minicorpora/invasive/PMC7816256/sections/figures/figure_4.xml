  <p>Effect of garlic mustard treatment over time on summed abundance of (a) mycorrhizal plant species and (b) non‐mycorrhizal plant species. Points are plot means of summed abundance in garlic mustard ambient (red circles) and garlic mustard weeded (purple triangles) treatments (2006–2016). Garlic mustard abundance was excluded. Error bars are ±SE. Vertical dashed lines separate pre‐garlic mustard weeded (2006) from post‐garlic mustard weeded time points. Summed abundance between treatments was not significantly different in 2006 (pre‐garlic mustard weeding). There was a significant main effect of the garlic mustard treatment on summed abundance of mycorrhizal plants, but no significant interaction between garlic mustard treatment and time. For non‐mycorrhizal plant species, the main effect of treatment was not significant, while the main effect of time was significant; there was no significant interaction between garlic mustard treatment and time. Asterisks indicate significant pairwise comparisons at 
   <italic>P</italic> = 0.05.
