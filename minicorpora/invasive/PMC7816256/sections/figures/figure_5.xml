  <p>Relative interaction index (RII) of each plant species between garlic mustard ambient and garlic mustard weeded treatments. A negative RII indicates that a species relative abundance is higher in the weeded treatment than in the ambient treatment. Conversely, a positive RII indicates that a species has lower relative abundance in the ambient treatment. Points are the mean RII for each species across plots and years, error bars are Â±SE.</p>
