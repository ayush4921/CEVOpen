<p>Garlic mustard weeding changed the diversity of mycorrhizal but not non‐mycorrhizal functional group. There was no effect of garlic mustard treatment or year on species richness of mycorrhizal plants (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Richness of non‐mycorrhizal plants did not respond to garlic mustard treatment but changed over time (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Evenness of the mycorrhizal functional group overall was 15.2% lower in the garlic mustard weeded treatments but did not change over time (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). In contrast, evenness of the non‐mycorrhizal functional group did not change between garlic mustard treatments but did change over time (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Shannon and Inverse Simpson diversity of the mycorrhizal group decreased overall by 14% and 23%, respectively, in garlic mustard weeded treatments (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>), but garlic mustard treatment had no effect on Shannon or inverse Simpson diversity of non‐mycorrhizal group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). There was no temporal trend in Shannon or inverse Simpson diversity for the mycorrhizal functional group, but there was a significant effect of year on Shannon and inverse Simpson diversity for the non‐mycorrhizal functional group.
