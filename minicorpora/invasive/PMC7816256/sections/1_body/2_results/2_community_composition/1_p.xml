<p>Composition of the mycorrhizal plant community (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>) differed between the garlic mustard ambient and garlic mustard weeded treatments. Conversely, the non‐mycorrhizal plant community did not differ significantly between treatments (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Community composition of both functional groups (mycorrhizal and non‐mycorrhizal) also changed over time (Appendix 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>: Fig. S1), However, we found no significant interaction between community composition and year in either functional group.
