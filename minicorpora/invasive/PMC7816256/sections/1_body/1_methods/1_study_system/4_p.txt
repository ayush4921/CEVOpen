0: In late June to early July in even years beginning in 2006, all herbaceous species within each subplot were identified to the species or genuslevel.
1: Since some species within a genus are not distinguishable from each other when they are not flowering (e.g.,  Impatiens, Trillium), these species were grouped by genus when estimating abundance.
2: To estimate species abundance, two observers were trained using standardized percent cover area templates.
3: Within a 2  2 m subplot, total leaf area occupied by each species was independently estimated by each observer, and we averaged estimated cover of the two observers.
4: Total abundance across all species for any subplot could be> 100% due to leaf overlap.
5: We calculated the mean abundance of each species across the 18 subplots for the garlic mustard weeded and garlic mustard ambient treatments within each plot in each sampling year.
