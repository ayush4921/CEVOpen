0: Trillium Trail Nature Reserve in Fox Chapel, Pennsylvania, USA (50.520237 N, 79.900932 W) is a beechmaple forest with a diverse understory plant community (Hale et al.
1: 2011).
2: The majority (~73%) of understory herbs at Trillium Trail partner with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi (Hale et al.
3: 2011) and provide photosynthetically derived carbon compounds in exchange for water and nutrients acquired by the fungi (Auge  2001, Van Der Heijden et al.
4: 2008).
5: Many of these mycorrhizal plant species have coarse roots with no root hairs (Brundrett and Kendrick  1988), which suggests that they rely heavily on their fungal partners for soil resources.
6: For these reasons, we expect that the effects of mycorrhizal mutualism disruption by allelopathic plant invaders could be dramatic at Trillium Trail, making it an ideal location to test for evidence of mutualism disruption at the community level.
