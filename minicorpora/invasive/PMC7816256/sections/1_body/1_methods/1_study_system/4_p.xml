<p>In late June to early July in even years beginning in 2006, all herbaceous species within each subplot were identified to the species‐ or genus‐level. Since some species within a genus are not distinguishable from each other when they are not flowering (e.g., 
 <italic>Impatiens</italic>,
 <italic>Trillium</italic>), these species were grouped by genus when estimating abundance. To estimate species abundance, two observers were trained using standardized percent cover area templates. Within a 2 × 2 m subplot, total leaf area occupied by each species was independently estimated by each observer, and we averaged estimated cover of the two observers. Total abundance across all species for any subplot could be&gt; 100% due to leaf overlap. We calculated the mean abundance of each species across the 18 subplots for the garlic mustard weeded and garlic mustard ambient treatments within each plot in each sampling year.
