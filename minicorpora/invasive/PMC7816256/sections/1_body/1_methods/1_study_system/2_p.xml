<p>Garlic mustard, a biennial herb, is invasive to temperate forests of North America and colonizes forest understories (Anderson et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">1996</xref>, Nuzzo 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>). Garlic mustard’s allelochemicals are toxic to AM fungi (Cantor et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). Exposure to these allelochemicals decreases growth and abundance of AM fungal hyphae in soil and roots (Rodgers et al.

 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>, Hale et al.

 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). As a result, native plants that rely on AM fungi for nutrient and water acquisition are negatively affected. Garlic mustard was first documented at Trillium Trail in the early 1990s (Knight et al.

 <italic>Maianthemum racemosum</italic>, a common species at Trillium Trail with coarse roots and high root AM fungal colonization rates, exhibited declines in carbon fixation and shifts in carbon storage, and altered vital rates following disruption of the mycorrhizal mutualism by garlic mustard (Brouwer et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>, Hale et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). For another common mycorrhizal species at our site, 
 <italic>Trillium erectum</italic>, garlic mustard invasion altered plant vital rates and reduced the population growth rate (Bialic‐Murphy et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). It is clear from these prior studies that garlic mustard disrupts the plant root AM fungal mutualism, the consequences of mutualism disruption are physiological in nature, and the physiological effects of mutualism disruption are strong enough to reduce population growth rates.
