<p>We characterized shifts in mycorrhizal and non‐mycorrhizal components of the plant community by quantifying changes in community dissimilarity in response to garlic mustard weeding and year. We further described patterns of community change by analyzing the effects of garlic mustard weeding and year on species richness, evenness, and diversity of mycorrhizal and non‐mycorrhizal plant species. We also tested for a difference in the abundance of mycorrhizal and non‐mycorrhizal plants between the garlic mustard ambient and weeded treatments. Finally, we asked whether individual species showed consistent responses that could be predicted by their functional group (i.e., mycorrhizal status).</p>
