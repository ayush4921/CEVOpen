0: We assigned a mycorrhizal status (mycorrhizal or nonmycorrhizal) to each recorded plant species based on available published and unpublished data (Appendix  S1: Table S1 and citations therein).
1: Species that form associations with AM fungi were assigned to the mycorrhizal functional group and species that do not form mycorrhizal associations were assigned to the nonmycorrhizal functional group.
2: None of the understory herbaceous species in our study formed mycorrhizal associations with nonAM fungi (i.e., ectomycorrhizal, ericoid).
3: We excluded species from our analyses with unknown mycorrhizal status.
4: The relative abundance of species with an unknown mycorrhizal status averaged 1.6% of the total abundance.
5: Since we manipulated garlic mustard abundance by weeding onehalf of each plot, garlic mustard was also excluded from all analyses.
6: In total, we were able to evaluate garlic mustards effects on 28 plant taxa (19 mycorrhizal, 9 nonmycorrhizal) across our experimental plots.
