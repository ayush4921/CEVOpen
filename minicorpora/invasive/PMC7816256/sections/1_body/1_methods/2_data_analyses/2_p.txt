0: We characterized shifts in mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal components of the plant community by quantifying changes in community dissimilarity in response to garlic mustard weeding and year.
1: We further described patterns of community change by analyzing the effects of garlic mustard weeding and year on species richness, evenness, and diversity of mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal plant species.
2: We also tested for a difference in the abundance of mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal plants between the garlic mustard ambient and weeded treatments.
3: Finally, we asked whether individual species showed consistent responses that could be predicted by their functional group (i.e., mycorrhizal status).
