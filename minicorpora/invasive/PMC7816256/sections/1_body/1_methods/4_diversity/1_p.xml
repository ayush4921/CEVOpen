<p>To determine whether garlic mustard weeding changed diversity in the plots over time, we calculated species richness, Pielou’s evenness, Shannon’s diversity, and inverse Simpson diversity of the mycorrhizal plant community and of the non‐mycorrhizal plant community every year for each treatment in each plot. Of the two diversity indices (Shannon and inverse Simpson), Shannon’s diversity is more sensitive to changes in rare species, whereas inverse Simpson diversity is more sensitive to changes in highly abundant species (Morris et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). We included all of these metrics because compound measurements such as Shannon and inverse Simpson diversity contain slightly different information about which piece of diversity is changing (rare or abundant species). In addition, Pielou’s evenness tends to correlate highly with Shannon’s diversity, so it is useful to interpret both of these indices alongside inverse Simpson diversity, because it is independent from evenness and Shannon’s diversity (Morris et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). For each of these four diversity metrics, we fit a linear model with garlic mustard treatment, year, and their interaction as fixed effects. We included plot as a random effect to account for repeated measurements of each plot across years.
