<p>Native plant response to garlic mustard invasion may be dependent on evolutionary history (e.g., have a phylogenetic signal). We tested for a phylogenetic signal (

 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0071" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). After correcting for multiple comparisons with a Bonferroni correction, there was no consistent effect of phylogenetic history of native plant responses to invasion and therefore we did not account for phylogenetic history in our statistical analyses.
