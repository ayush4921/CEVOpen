0: All statistical analyses were conducted in R version 3.5.1 (R Core Team  2018).
1: We tested for phylogenetic signal using the Picante package version 1.8 (Kembel et al.
2: 2010).
3: Linear models were estimated with the glmmTMB package version 0.2.2.0 (Brooks et al.
4: 2017).
5: We assessed the fit of these models using the DHARMa package version 0.2.0 (Hartig  2016).
6: Treatment effects of the linear models were tested using a Wald chisquared test.
7: We analyzed linear model interaction terms using Type III sum of squares and, when interactions were not significant, we analyzed main effects using Type II sum of squares.
8: We tested for significant pairwise comparisons between garlic mustard treatments within year at  P = 0.05 using the emmeans package version 1.3.5.1 (Lenth  2019).
9: We used the vegan package version 2.53 (Oksanen et al.
10: 2019) to calculate diversity metrics and to test for changes in community composition using PERMANOVA.
