0: Native plant response to garlic mustard invasion may be dependent on evolutionary history (e.g., have a phylogenetic signal).
1: We tested for a phylogenetic signal ( K; Blomberg et al.
2: 2003) in all metrics of native plant response separately for each year and treatment on an ultrametric supertree phylogeny created following methods in Worchel et al.
3: ( 2013).
4: After correcting for multiple comparisons with a Bonferroni correction, there was no consistent effect of phylogenetic history of native plant responses to invasion and therefore we did not account for phylogenetic history in our statistical analyses.
