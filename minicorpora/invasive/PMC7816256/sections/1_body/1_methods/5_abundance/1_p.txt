0: We tested for changes in abundance within each functional group (i.e., mycorrhizal status) between garlic mustard ambient and weeded treatments using a generalized linear mixed effects model including the garlic mustard treatment, year, and their interaction as fixed effects.
1: We fit separate models for each functional group, with the summed percent cover of all mycorrhizal species or of all nonmycorrhizal species, as the response variable, respectively.
2: To control for nonindependence due to repeated sampling of plots over time, we included plot as a random effect.
3: Summed percent cover for each functional group never exceeded 100% so we modeled proportional cover using a beta distribution.
