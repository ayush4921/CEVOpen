<p>The indirect or competitive interactions that are typical of plant invaders are particularly difficult to detect and predict (Suding et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0065" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>), and understanding mechanisms of invasion involving these types of interactions typically requires manipulative studies. Many processes can underlie invader impact (Ricciardi et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>), but the mutualism disruption hypothesis (Hale and Kalisz 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>) is particularly well suited to evaluating invader impact from individual species to the community because we can make predictions about which native species within a community will be affected based on their known mutualism dependence. Under this hypothesis, an invasive species can gain a competitive advantage over mutualism‚Äêdependent native species by reducing or eliminating the benefits of these mutualisms (Hale and Kalisz 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>, Traveset and Richardson 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0067" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). The effects of mutualism disruption have been observed in a variety of invaded systems. Compelling examples include the disruption of ant seed dispersal in the presence of the Argentine ant (
 <italic>Linepithema humile</italic>) that resulted in a shift of the resident plant community based on seed and elaiosome size (Christian 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>, Rowles and Dowd 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>), the predation of seed dispersing birds to near extinction by the brown tree snake (
 <italic>Boiga irregularis</italic>) that severely reduced native tree recruitment on Guam (Rogers et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>), and the usurpation of native pollination services by the showy flowered purple loosestrife (
 <italic>Lythrum salicaria</italic>) that led to a steep decline in pollinator visitation to native flowers (Brown et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). Mutualism disruption is widespread, and can negatively affect dispersal, reproductive, or nutritive mutualisms.
