0: The global threat of mutualism disruption is particularly substantial for plantmycorrhizal mutualisms because of their ubiquity (Soudzilovskaia et al.
1: 2020) and their importance for plant growth, function, and community dynamics (Van Der Heijden et al.
2: 2008).
3: Invasive plants can impact plantmycorrhizal mutualisms in various ways (Grove et al.
4: 2017): by directly competing with native plants, which weakens the native plants contribution to their mycorrhizal partnership (Grove et al.
5: 2017), by changing soil properties to alter the balance of resource exchange between plant and fungal partners (Allison et al.
6: 2006, Johnson  2010), or by directly inhibiting the mutualism via invaderproduced toxic secondary chemistry (allelochemicals) (Hale and Kalisz  2012).
7: The specific mechanism of mycorrhizal mutualism disruption may vary among invasive species but toxic allelochemistry is common.
8: Using published lists of invasive plant families (Pysek et al.
9: 2012) and plant families with known allelopathic properties (Hale and Kalisz  2012), we estimate that 41% of invasive plant families are allelopathic ( unpublished data).
10: Of these allelopathic plant invaders,  Alliaria petiolata (Brassicaceae, Bieb.
11: Cavara & Grande, hereafter garlic mustard) is emerging as a model for understanding allelopathic mycorrhizal mutualism disruption (Cipollini and Cipollini  2016).
