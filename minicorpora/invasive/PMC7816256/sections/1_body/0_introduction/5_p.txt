0: Experimental evidence in both controlled and field settings has established that garlic mustard reduces native plant performance and population growth through the disruption of their mycorrhizal associations (e.g., Stinson et al.
1: 2006, Callaway et al.
2: 2008, Wolfe et al.
3: 2008, Barto et al.
4: 2011, Hale et al.
5: 2011,  2016, Brouwer et al.
6: 2015, BialicMurphy et al.
7: 2019).
8: Furthermore, garlic mustard is a poor direct competitor (Meekins and McCarthy  1999, Bossdorf et al.
9: 2004), and has no known direct phytotoxic effects (Brouwer et al.
10: 2015, Hale et al.
11: 2016).
12: In addition, there is evidence that an increase in garlic mustard abundance is associated with lower native plant diversity (Stinson et al.
13: 2007), and that communitylevel responses to garlic mustard vary by species and by abiotic conditions (Haines et al.
14: 2018).
15: However, it is unknown whether the physiological consequences of mutualism disruption for individual plant species, mediated by declines in function of plantmycorrhizal fungal partnerships, are linked to the shifts in plant community diversity and composition following garlic mustard invasion (Stinson et al.
16: 2007, Callaway et al.
17: 2008, Cipollini and Cipollini  2016, McCary et al.
18: 2019).
