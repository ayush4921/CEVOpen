<p>The global threat of mutualism disruption is particularly substantial for plant–mycorrhizal mutualisms because of their ubiquity (Soudzilovskaia et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0061" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>) and their importance for plant growth, function, and community dynamics (Van Der Heijden et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0068" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). Invasive plants can impact plant–mycorrhizal mutualisms in various ways (Grove et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>): by directly competing with native plants, which weakens the native plant’s contribution to their mycorrhizal partnership (Grove et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>), by changing soil properties to alter the balance of resource exchange between plant and fungal partners (Allison et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>, Johnson 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>), or by directly inhibiting the mutualism via invader‐produced toxic secondary chemistry (allelochemicals) (Hale and Kalisz 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). The specific mechanism of mycorrhizal mutualism disruption may vary among invasive species but toxic allelochemistry is common. Using published lists of invasive plant families (Pyšek et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0053" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>) and plant families with known allelopathic properties (Hale and Kalisz 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>), we estimate that 41% of invasive plant families are allelopathic (
 <italic>unpublished data</italic>). Of these allelopathic plant invaders, 
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> (Brassicaceae, Bieb. Cavara &amp; Grande, hereafter garlic mustard) is emerging as a model for understanding allelopathic mycorrhizal mutualism disruption (Cipollini and Cipollini 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>).
