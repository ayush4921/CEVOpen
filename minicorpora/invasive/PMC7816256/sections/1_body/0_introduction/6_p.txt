0: Here, we exploit the power of this wellestablished mechanism of invasion impact to test for a link between mutualism disruption of mycorrhizal plant individuals and communitylevel response of the forest understory to garlic mustard invasion.
1: A large portion of the diversity in most Eastern deciduous forests exists in the understory, and these species are also diverse in their mycorrhizal associations (Gilliam  2007, Soudzilovskaia et al.
2: 2020), making the forest understory community a highly relevant study system.
3: We present analyses of data collected from a 11yr garlic mustard weeding experiment in replicated plots to assess whether garlic mustard differentially impacts native mycorrhizal vs. nonmycorrhizal herbaceous understory plant species.
4: We ask two questions: (1) Does the release and recovery from garlic mustard invasion (i.e., garlic mustard weeded treatment) differentially affect the community composition and diversity of mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal herbaceous understory plant communities?
5: (2) Are changes in community composition and diversity explained by shifts in abundance of mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal plant species?
6: Based on the mutualism disruption hypothesis, we expect a greater change in the community composition, diversity, and abundance of mycorrhizal plants (i.e., the functional groups most sensitive to garlic mustards allelochemicals) than nonmycorrhizal plants, culminating in a distinct signature of mutualism disruption at the community level.
