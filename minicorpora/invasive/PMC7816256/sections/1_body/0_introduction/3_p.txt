0: The indirect or competitive interactions that are typical of plant invaders are particularly difficult to detect and predict (Suding et al.
1: 2008), and understanding mechanisms of invasion involving these types of interactions typically requires manipulative studies.
2: Many processes can underlie invader impact (Ricciardi et al.
3: 2013), but the mutualism disruption hypothesis (Hale and Kalisz  2012) is particularly well suited to evaluating invader impact from individual species to the community because we can make predictions about which native species within a community will be affected based on their known mutualism dependence.
4: Under this hypothesis, an invasive species can gain a competitive advantage over mutualismdependent native species by reducing or eliminating the benefits of these mutualisms (Hale and Kalisz  2012, Traveset and Richardson  2014).
5: The effects of mutualism disruption have been observed in a variety of invaded systems.
6: Compelling examples include the disruption of ant seed dispersal in the presence of the Argentine ant ( Linepithema humile) that resulted in a shift of the resident plant community based on seed and elaiosome size (Christian  2001, Rowles and Dowd  2009), the predation of seed dispersing birds to near extinction by the brown tree snake ( Boiga irregularis) that severely reduced native tree recruitment on Guam (Rogers et al.
7: 2017), and the usurpation of native pollination services by the showy flowered purple loosestrife ( Lythrum salicaria) that led to a steep decline in pollinator visitation to native flowers (Brown et al.
8: 2002).
9: Mutualism disruption is widespread, and can negatively affect dispersal, reproductive, or nutritive mutualisms.
