<p>Many invasive plant species are thought to impact native species by allelopathy and/or mutualism disruption (e.g.,

 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>), so our findings likely apply to the impacts of invasive plants beyond garlic mustard. In addition, since approximately 80% of understory herbs globally (and two‐thirds of the study species in our experimental plots; Appendix 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>: Table S1) form mycorrhizal associations (Soudzilovskaia et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0061" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>), there is potential for garlic mustard to drastically shift understory plant communities across its invasive range. We demonstrate that mycorrhizal mutualism disruption by an invasive plant leads to a shift in plant communities but found that responses were variable among species within functional groups. This suggests that the ability to predict invader impacts across space and time may require refinement of the focal functional trait, in this case a shift from a binary to a continuous view of mycorrhizal dependency. Our study highlights the utility of exploring the mechanisms by which invasive species cause impact because we find a shift in functional groups of the resident plant community that would only be anticipated by knowing that mechanism.
