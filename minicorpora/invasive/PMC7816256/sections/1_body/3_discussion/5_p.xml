<p>Our results revealed that the mycorrhizal plant community had decreased evenness and diversity in the garlic mustard weeded treatments. The decreases in Shannon and inverse Simpson diversity of the mycorrhizal plant community are likely driven by the lower evenness in the garlic mustard weeded treatments, since there was no change in species richness for this group. Evenness of the mycorrhizal plant community decreased in the garlic mustard weeded plots because of the dramatic increase in the abundance of a common annual species, 
 <italic>Impatiens</italic> spp., after 2006 (Appendix 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>: Fig. S2). This created a less balanced community with low evenness where one species (
 <italic>Impatiens</italic> spp.) has a very high abundance whereas the rest of the species remain at a low abundance. Since 
 <italic>Impatiens spp</italic>. have an annual life history and often exhibit ruderal growth patterns in comparison to many of the long‐lived perennials at our site, we expect that the long‐lived perennial species will rebound as well with more time.
