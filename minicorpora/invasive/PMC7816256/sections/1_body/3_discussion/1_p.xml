<p>Numerous studies demonstrate that invasive plants have negative impacts on native species (Vilà et al.

 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0053" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). However, to anticipate 
 <italic>how</italic> resident plant communities shift and which native species are most likely to be impacted by an invader, we must explore the mechanisms by which invasive plants displace natives (Levine et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>, Sofaer et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0060" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Using detailed data from a 11‐yr manipulative field experiment, we found that the removal of garlic mustard (i.e., weeded treatment) altered the composition, decreased the diversity, and increased the abundance of the mycorrhizal plant community in comparison to ambient levels of garlic mustard invasion. In contrast, there were no effects of the garlic mustard treatments on the non‐mycorrhizal plant community, which is not susceptible to garlic mustard’s disruption of mycorrhizal mutualisms. Our study illustrates that the consequences of garlic mustard invasion for the plant community may be anticipated by incorporating an understanding of mutualism disruption into future invasion predictions, because garlic mustard weeding favored mycorrhizal, but not non‐mycorrhizal plant species. Our results are consistent with previous work that found variation in response to garlic mustard by mycorrhizal dependency of forest tree seedlings (Stinson et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0062" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). Together, our findings and previous work demonstrate that garlic mustard invasion results in a functional shift in plant community membership that can be reversed over time with removal of the invader.
