<p>Garlic mustard consistently has negative effects on native mycorrhizal plant species (e.g., Stinson et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0062" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>, Cipollini et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>, Wolfe et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0070" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). These negative effects on mycorrhizal plant species are consistent with garlic mustard’s disruption of native mycorrhizal mutualisms, which leads to water stress and carbon stress (Brouwer et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>, Hale et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>) and decreases in vital rates (Brouwer et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>) and population growth rates (Bialic‐Murphy et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). In addition, garlic mustard alters plant communities (Stinson et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0063" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). Our results build on these findings to show that the outcomes symptomatic of mutualism disruption in individual plants follow a similar pattern for plant communities in the field. Our 11‐yr long‐term field experiment shows that, even at the modest garlic mustard abundances at Trillium Trail, mutualism disruption alters the community composition, changes diversity, and reduces the abundance of only the mycorrhizal plants within the entire plant community. We stress that the length of our experiment provides strong support for the long‐term effects of garlic mustard on the mycorrhizal plant community. Most studies that evaluate the impacts of invasive species last only 1 yr (Stricker et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy3201-bib-0064" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>) even though the effects of invaders are known to lag after the invasion establishes and have legacy effects after they are removed. Land managers attempting to restore native understories through garlic mustard removal may expect to see an increase in abundance of mycorrhizal plant species, but likely no changes in species richness. However, responses may differ by species’ sensitivity to garlic mustard (see Fig.

 <xref rid="ecy3201-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>: Fig. S3), and may require multiple years (in our experimental study 4–6 yr) of annual garlic mustard removal to occur.
