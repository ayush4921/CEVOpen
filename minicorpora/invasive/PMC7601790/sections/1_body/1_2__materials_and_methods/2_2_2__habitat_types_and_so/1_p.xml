<p>Populations of 
 <italic>A. ochroleuca</italic> were surveyed in seven habitats: abandoned fields, roadsides, cultivated fields, wadi channels, wetlands, mountain ranges, and sandy plains. For each habitat, we randomly selected ten plots (5 m × 5 m) at the peak of the growing season (spring) for later measurements. Soil samples were collected randomly from three different locations (0 to 30 cm depth) within each plot and subsequently pooled for each plot. Soil samples were air-dried at room temperature before oven drying at 70 °C and sieved through a 2-mm sieve. Soil texture was determined by the hydrometer method, providing quantitative data on the percentage of sand, silt, and clay [
