0: Populations of  A. ochroleuca were surveyed in seven habitats: abandoned fields, roadsides, cultivated fields, wadi channels, wetlands, mountain ranges, and sandy plains.
1: For each habitat, we randomly selected ten plots (5 m  5 m) at the peak of the growing season (spring) for later measurements.
2: Soil samples were collected randomly from three different locations (0 to 30 cm depth) within each plot and subsequently pooled for each plot.
3: Soil samples were air-dried at room temperature before oven drying at 70 C and sieved through a 2-mm sieve.
4: Soil texture was determined by the hydrometer method, providing quantitative data on the percentage of sand, silt, and clay [ 39].
5: Soil organic matter (OM) was determined by wet combustion with dichromate at 450 C [ 40].
6: Soil water extracts (1:5) were prepared for the estimation of soil electrical conductivity (EC) and pH [ 40].
7: Soluble inions (Cl and SO 4) were determined by titration method, while soluble cations (Ca, Mg, Na, and K) were determined using a flame photometer according to Rhoades [ 41].
8: Available phosphorus was determined colorimetrically as described by Nelson and Sommers [ 42].
9: Available nitrogen was determined by the Kjeldahl method as described by Bremner and Mulvaney [ 43].
