0: The study was carried out in an area running from Al-Taif to Al-Baha in the southwest of Saudi Arabia with a distance of 245-km-long ( Figure 1).
1: The area is largely dominated by rugged escarpment and drainage streams (wadis).
2: However, many sites have sandy and alluvial plains where agriculture is the main activity.
3: The area lies within the tropical and arid climate with an average annual rainfall of 165 mm [ 36].
4: Rainfall is most predictable in the spring and summer but can occur during any month of the year when moist air is forced up the escarpment from the Red Sea [ 37].
5: Most of the rainfall is associated with intense thunderstorms [ 38].
6: Such heavy rain storms lead to the formation of many temporary ponds that can exist for more than one month.
7: The average air temperature is 16.5 C in winter and 29.1 C in summer.
