<p>It is worth mentioning here that the soil of the abandoned fields habitat attained high content of organic matter and nutrients (

In addition, human disturbance in some habitats, such as cultivated and abandoned fields and roadsides, may increase the environmental heterogeneity that facilitates the invasibility by increasing the availability of resources, or by decreasing competition [
