<p>Several studies indicated that many invasive plant species may achieve fast-growth through changes in below- and above-ground biomass allocation which might be associated with the successful invasion [

 <xref rid="B68-plants-09-01268" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Within each habitat, 
 <italic>A. ochroleuca</italic> allocated more resources towards the vegetative and reproductive above-ground parts than to the below-ground parts which is a characteristic of many invasive species [
 <xref rid="B69-plants-09-01268" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], and the population of abandoned fields generally had a greater resource investment in below-ground structures compared to other habitats. Such a shift in resource allocation indicates intraspecific variation and potential plasticity in plant functional traits under different environmental conditions. In old fields, Aerts and Chapin [
 <xref rid="B70-plants-09-01268" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] argued that fast-growing invasive species are potentially increasing nutrient acquisition through increased resource allocation to roots. The adjusted resource allocation between sexual and vegetative organs in 
 <italic>A. ochroleuca</italic> is likely to be important behavior in determining its colonizing ability in different habitat types. This is supported by the variations of functional traits among habitat types as an adaptive strategy to different environments [
