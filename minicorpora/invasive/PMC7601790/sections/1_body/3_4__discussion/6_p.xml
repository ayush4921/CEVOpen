<p>In contrast to the abandoned fields, the mountain ranges habitat attained the lowest measurements of almost all functional traits (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01268-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This could be attributed to low disturbance and low resources as well. Native species have more adaptability than invasive species in low resource habitats [
 <xref rid="B61-plants-09-01268" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The soil of the mountain ranges habitat has very low contents of organic matter, nitrogen, and phosphorus. This agrees with the resource fluctuating hypothesis, and therefore, the native plant community in the mountain ranges habitat becomes more resistant to invasion [
