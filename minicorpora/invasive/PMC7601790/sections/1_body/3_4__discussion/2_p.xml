<p>On the basis of the measured functional traits, there is clear evidence that the invasion capacity of 
 <italic>A. ochroleuca</italic> is largely dependent on resource availability in different habitats. The resource fluctuation hypothesis is one of the most important hypotheses of plant invasion [
 <xref rid="B52-plants-09-01268" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], where invasive plants become facilitated by high resource availability driven by disturbance or low resource utilization by the native plant community. The nutrient-rich habitats are more vulnerable to invasion than resource-poor habitats [

 <xref rid="B53-plants-09-01268" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. However, in some cases, invasive plant species flourish in poor-nutrients habitats [
 <xref rid="B54-plants-09-01268" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], where they employ resource conservation traits such as high resource-use efficiency.
