<p>For example, the height, ramifications, and canopy diameter of the wadi channels habitat were 3.1-, 2.7-, and 2.1-fold higher than those recorded in the mountain ranges habitat, respectively (

 <italic>A. ochroleuca</italic> populations in the abandoned fields habitat was about 3-fold of that in mountain ranges habitat. The wadi channels habitat attained the highest values of leaf area (116.77 cm

 <italic>A. ochroleuca</italic> populations growing in sandy plains habitat. The specific leaf area was more variable among habitats, with the highest and the lowest values in abandoned fields and sandy plains, respectively (
