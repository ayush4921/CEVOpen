<p>Finally, the heatmap analysis showed that the populations growing in the wadi channels habitat showed positive correlations with all soil variables except sand percentage and pH, while the mountain ranges habitat showed a reversed manner (

 <italic>A. ochroleuca</italic> populations growing in the abandoned fields and roadsides habitats were positively correlated with most of the functional traits (both vegetative and reproductive), while the mountain ranges and cultivated fields habitats showed negative correlations with all parameters except the leaf thickness (
