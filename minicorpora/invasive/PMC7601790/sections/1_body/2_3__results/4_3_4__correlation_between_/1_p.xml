<p>The correlation between the habitats and the soil parameters, using CCA, revealed that most of the soil variables are correlated to each other except the sand fraction (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01268-f004">Figure 4</xref>). The abandoned fields habitat showed a significant correlation to total N, available N, total P, silt, and clay, as well as this habitat, showed relative correlation to available P, organic matter, Ca, and Mg. However, the mountain ranges and sandy plains habitats revealed a close correlation to each other and showed a correlation to the sand fraction.
