<p>The AHC analysis of the functional traits of 
 <italic>A. ochroleuca</italic> showed that abandoned fields, cultivated fields, and roadsides habitats were closely related, while wetlands, sandy plains, and mountain ranges habitats were similar in the vegetative and reproductive traits (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01268-f005">Figure 5</xref>A). The wadi channels habitat was separated alone. The cluster analysis based on the soil variables of the seven studied habitats revealed that wadi channels, mountain ranges, sandy plains, and roadsides habitats were grouped together, while the cultivated fields and wetlands habitats were closely related to each other (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01268-f005">Figure 5</xref>C). The abandoned fields habitat showed unrivaled characteristics of the soil but showed a correlation to the cultivated fields and wetland group.
