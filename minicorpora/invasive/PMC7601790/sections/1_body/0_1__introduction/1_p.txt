0: Invasive alien plants have become a serious threat to native plant diversity and ecosystem function in many regions of the world [ 1].
1: A major challenge for plant ecologists is to highlight how invasive species respond to the variation in environmental conditions [ 2, 3].
2: Successful invaders often demonstrate high levels of plasticity that allow them to succeed in a wide range of habitats [ 4, 5, 6, 7].
3: Thus, comparing the relative performance of potential invaders in different habitats may help in understanding their strategies and mechanisms that could guide their control and management, especially in the fragile ecosystems [ 8].
