0: Arid environments are considered as the ecosystems least affected by biological invasions [ 25].
1: However, in recent years, many invasive species have predominantly invaded managed and/or disturbed areas, such as agricultural fields and roadsides [ 2, 26].
2: Furthermore, some of these species have escaped to many natural habitats including wetlands, rangelands, and biodiversity hotspots, and can generate significant negative impacts on ecosystem processes and functions [ 2, 27, 28].
3: Given the wide expansion of many invasive species across a range of desert habitats, more studies are required on their morphological and reproductive attributes that promote their spreading and invasion success.
