0: This study explores how different vegetative (shoot height, canopy diameter, ramifications, root length, root dry mass, leaf area, leaf dry mass, SLA, leaf thickness, seeds/fruit, root mass fraction, vegetative mass fraction, and reproductive mass fraction) and reproductive traits (flowers/individual, fruits/individual, and fruit dry mass), correlate to the successful invasion of  A. ochroleuca in different habitats.
1: We expect that plant functional traits vary with different habitat types as an intraspecific divergence and plasticity to different environmental conditions.
2: The objectives of this study are to: (1) compare the vegetative traits related to resource capture, growth rate and competitive ability across different habitats; (2) determine biomass allocation to roots, vegetative and reproductive plant parts; (3) identify the possible edaphic factors that may influence the relative resource allocation performance of  A. ochroleuca across different habitat types.
