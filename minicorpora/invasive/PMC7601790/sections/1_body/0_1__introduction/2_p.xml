<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that functional traits of invasive species often vary across different habitat types [

 <xref rid="B12-plants-09-01268" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Variations of plant shoot and root system characteristics are considered good morphological attributes for predicting successful invasion among different habitat types [

 <xref rid="B15-plants-09-01268" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In addition, several studies indicated that in some habitats, invasive species may show higher values of specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC) than in other habitats [

 <xref rid="B16-plants-09-01268" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These foliar attributes are considered effective functional traits as they are expected to be predictors of both plant strategy and fast resource capture and maybe the primary process influencing successful invasions [
