0: Alternatively, reproductive traits of invasive species change due to variations in ecological conditions and biophysical constraints within different habitats [ 5, 18].
1: Invasive species may be found at higher densities and with higher reproductive rates in some habitats than others [ 19].
2: Habitats with increased resources tend to be more productive for invasive species with higher reproductive output and higher rates of spread [ 20].
3: In addition, invasive species cope with habitat changes by increasing biomass allocation to reproductive structures [ 5, 21].
4: Plants adjust allocation of carbon assimilates between their organs to ensure the persistence of the species in a specific habitat [ 22].
5: Invasive species are usually physiologically plastic, allowing them to adapt to a variety of habitats and assure successful invasion [ 18, 23, 24].
