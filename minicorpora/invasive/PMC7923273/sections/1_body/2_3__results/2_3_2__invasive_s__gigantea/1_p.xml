Ergosterol is an important constituent of the cell membranes of higher fungi, and as such, it correlates fairly well with fungal biomass. Using qPCR assays, the total bacterial and fungal communities were assessed, and no significant differences in fungal and bacterial DNA concentrations were observed, neither between invaded and non-invaded habitats nor between the two habitat types (
 <xref rid="microorganisms-09-00437-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). For further verification, two single-copy fungal markers (TUB2, a beta-tubulin) and TEF1, translation elongation factor 1-alpha) were tested, and no significant differences between invaded and uninvaded plots were observed (data not shown).
