<p>Keeping in mind that ergosterol measurements predominantly reflect the presence of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, representatives of two major distal clades within the kingdom Fungi [
 <xref rid="B21-microorganisms-09-00437" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], these phyla were quantified separately. In the riparian vegetation habitats, a trend was observed of Ascomycota having a higher DNA concentration in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-09-00437-f001">Figure 1</xref>). A similar invasion effect was observed when both habitats were analysed together (F

 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0738; 
 <xref rid="microorganisms-09-00437-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The mean DNA concentration of Basidiomycota on sandy soils was about three times higher than the DNA concentration in the river clay soils (F

 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0166; 
 <xref rid="microorganisms-09-00437-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The DNA concentrations of Basidiomycota did not differ between invaded and uninvaded plots (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-09-00437-f001">Figure 1</xref>). In addition, Chytridiomycota were measured, being a fungal phylum that uses cholesterol instead of ergosterol as its major sterol, but no differences were observed between giant goldenrod-invaded and uninvaded plots. Comparison of Chytridiomycota between the two major habitats revealed no difference in DNA concentrations.
