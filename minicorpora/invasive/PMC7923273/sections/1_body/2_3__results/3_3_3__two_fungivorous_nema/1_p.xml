<p>The total nematode abundance and density of the three fungivorous nematode taxa that were commonly present in both the Pleistocene sand and river clay locations were analysed to study the belowground impact of 
 <italic>S. gigantea</italic> on the next trophic level of the soil food web. Representatives of the families Aphelenchidae, Aphelenchoididae, and the genus 
 <italic>Diphtherophora</italic> were used to determine whether and if so how the observed increase in biomass of higher fungi and unchanged fungal DNA levels were reflected in the local fungivorous nematode community.
