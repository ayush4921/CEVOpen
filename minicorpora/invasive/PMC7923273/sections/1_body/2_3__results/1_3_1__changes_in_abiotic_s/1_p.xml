<p>To gain insight into the abiotic environment of the 
 <italic>S. gigantea</italic>-invaded sites, the soil moisture content, pH, OM content, total C content, total N content, and C:N ratio were analysed. Significant changes were observed in soil moisture content, pH, and OM content between 
 <italic>S. gigantea</italic>-invaded and uninvaded plots in riparian and semi-natural grasslands sites (
