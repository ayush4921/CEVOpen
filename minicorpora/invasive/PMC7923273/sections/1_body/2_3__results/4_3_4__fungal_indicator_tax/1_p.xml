<p>Invasion by 
 <italic>S. gigantea</italic> resulted in a local increase in fungal biomass, but not in total fungal DNA. This remarkable observation was investigated in more detail by comparing the composition of the communities. As a crude measure for fungal DNA content, we compared the number of primary reads per sample. Whereas soil samples from uninvaded plots gave rise to ≈95,000 (SD 39,000) reads per sample, on average ≈102,000 reads (SD 37,000) were generated from samples from invaded plots. There was no significant difference in number of reads per sample between invaded and uninvaded plots. Although it is hard to compare qPCR data with Illumina reads, the sequencing data confirm the absence of a difference in fungal DNA contents between 
 <italic>S. gigantea</italic>-invaded and uninvaded plots.
