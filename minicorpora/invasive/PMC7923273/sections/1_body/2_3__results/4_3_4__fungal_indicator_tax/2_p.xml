<p>PERMANOVA on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity profiles identified “habitat type” (riparian vegetation vs. natural grassland) as the main factor responsible for the difference in fungal composition (
 <xref rid="microorganisms-09-00437-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). This factor explained ≈27% of the overall variance. The second most informative variable was “study site” with an R
 <sup>2</sup> value of 0.23. This is the variation in fungal communities between the various sampling sites within a habitat type. Against the substantial background variation caused by habitat type and study site, a clear invasion effect still could be discerned. This effect explained a low but significant percentage of the overall variation (1.7%). As can be seen in 
 <xref rid="microorganisms-09-00437-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, analyses of fungal communities for the two habitat types separately revealed significant effects. The effect of plant invasion on fungal assemblages was more pronounced in the semi-natural grasslands (

 <italic>p</italic> = 0.01 for riparian vegetation).
