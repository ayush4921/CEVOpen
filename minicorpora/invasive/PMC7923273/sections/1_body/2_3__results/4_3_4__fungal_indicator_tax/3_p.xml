<p>Linear discriminant analysis Effect Size (LEfSe) analysis allowed us to determine which fungal taxa contributed most to observed differences between 
 <italic>S. gigantea</italic> invaded and uninvaded plots. With an LDA threshold of &gt;2, the families Cladosporiaceae, Teratosphaeriaceae (both Ascomycota), Glomeraceae (Glomeromycota), and Kondoaceae (Basidiomycota) were shown to be more abundant in plots invaded with
