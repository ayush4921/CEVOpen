<p>Our results showed quantitative and qualitative shifts in the fungal community brought about by the invasive plant species 
 <italic>S. gigantea</italic>. Consistently, i.e., during multiple growth stages, over multiple years, and at multiple locations, invasive giant goldenrod was shown to induce a local increase in fungal biomass [

 <xref rid="B20-microorganisms-09-00437" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Qualitative characterization of the fungal assemblages revealed that 
 <italic>S. gigantea</italic> invasion was accompanied by a local increase in abundance of members of the families Cladosporiaceae and Glomeraceae, and a decreased presence of Cucurbitariaceae followed by an increase of the fungivorous nematode lineages Aphelenchoididae and Aphelenchidae. The interpretations of our results are presented below.
