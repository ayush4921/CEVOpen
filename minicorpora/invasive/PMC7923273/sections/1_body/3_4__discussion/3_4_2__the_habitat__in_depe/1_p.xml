<p>Due to the apparently contradictory results obtained by the two types of fungal biomass markers, the effects of 
 <italic>S. gigantea</italic> on major representatives of the next trophic level, fungivorous nematodes, were checked. Two out of three lineages of fungivores, Aphelenchoididae and Aphelenchidae, both present in the riparian zone and in the semi-natural grassland sites, were shown to be stimulated in the presence of giant goldenrod, whereas the third lineage, the genus 
 <italic>Diphtherophorida</italic>, was unaffected by this invasive plant species. Moreover, the effects in the riparian habitats were much more pronounced than the effects in the sandy locations.
