<p>A boost of Aphelenchoididae and Aphelenchidae was observed in river clay soil, and a non-significant increase was seen in sandy soils (e.g., 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-09-00437-f001">Figure 1</xref>). This difference in response might be explained by the soil texture-dependent species representation for each of these two families. Apparently, the 
 <italic>Aphelenchoides</italic> species present in the river clay soil could benefit more from the local increase in fungal biomass than the 
 <italic>Aphelenchoides</italic> species present in the sandy soils. We propose the same line of reasoning for the Aphelenchidae genera 
 <italic>Aphelenchus</italic> and 
 <italic>Paraphelenchus</italic>. Representatives of the genus 
 <italic>Diphtherophora</italic> were unaffected by the presence of giant goldenrod, which could be caused by a difference in food preference between the lineages [
