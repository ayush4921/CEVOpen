<p>While the increase in Aphelenchoididae as a result of giant goldenrod invasion was found previously [
 <xref rid="B19-microorganisms-09-00437" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], the increase in Aphelenchidae was new. As nematode densities in these fields fluctuate during the season [
 <xref rid="B28-microorganisms-09-00437" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], it is conceivable that the 
 <italic>S. gigantea</italic>-induced increase in Aphelenchidae is only noticeable late in the season. A recent, elaborate study found many Aphelenchoididae species as well as 
 <italic>Aphelenchus avenae</italic> (Aphelenchidae) to be positively correlated with invasive 
 <italic>S. gigantea</italic> plots [
 <xref rid="B47-microorganisms-09-00437" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. This strengthens our findings that both lineages are stimulated by 
 <italic>S. gigantea</italic> invasion.
