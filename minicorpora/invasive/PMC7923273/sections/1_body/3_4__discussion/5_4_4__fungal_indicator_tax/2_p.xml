 <italic>Cladosporium</italic> is a fairly speciose genus. It comprises 189 species that are mostly saprotrophic; in addition, it also harbours some plant pathogens [
 <xref rid="B52-microorganisms-09-00437" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Although in its native range, leaves of showy goldenrod (
 <italic>Solidago speciosa</italic>) were shown to be infested by 
 <italic>Cladosporium asterum,</italic> causing brown rust pustules (website Missouri Botanical Garden, USA), no information was found on 
 <italic>Cladosporium</italic> being an important pathogen of 
 <italic>S. gigantea</italic> in Europe. On the other hand, plant growth-promoting characteristics of members of the genus 
 <italic>Cladosporium</italic> could be marked as a possible benefit for 
 <italic>S. gigantea</italic> associated with fostering 
 <italic>Cladosporium</italic> in its rhizosphere. Both 
 <italic>Cladosporium sphaerospermum</italic> and 
 <italic>Cladosporium</italic> sp. MH-6 were found to produce and release several types of gibberellins with plant growth-promoting characteristics [
