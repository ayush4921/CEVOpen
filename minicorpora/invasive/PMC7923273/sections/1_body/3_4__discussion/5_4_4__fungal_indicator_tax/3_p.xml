<p>Glomeraceae was the second most indicative family regarding the impact of 
 <italic>S. gigantea</italic> on the local fungal community. Glomeraceae is a family of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and members of this family colonize the roots of a wide range of vascular plants including 
 <italic>S. gigantea</italic> [
 <xref rid="B55-microorganisms-09-00437" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Vallino et al. [
 <xref rid="B56-microorganisms-09-00437" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] characterized the AMF colonization of 
 <italic>S. gigantea</italic> outside its native range, and identified 
 <italic>Glomus</italic>, a genus belonging to the Glomeraceae, as the dominant root colonizing AMF [
 <xref rid="B56-microorganisms-09-00437" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. This result underlines that invasive 
 <italic>S. gigantea</italic> can recruit local AMF and establish such a successful interaction that it ends up as one of the main fungal taxa typifying the community shift that was brought about by the invasive plant species.
