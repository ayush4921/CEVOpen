<p>High-throughput sequencing revealed multiple fungal families as indicative for invasion. In the previous section we hypothesized that this difference in response could have been caused by a difference in food preference between the lineages. Interestingly, 
 <italic>Cladosporium</italic> was identified as a moderate feeding source for 
 <italic>Aphelenchoidides</italic> sp [
 <xref rid="B49-microorganisms-09-00437" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], which is in line with our observations. Unfortunately, little is known about food preferences of fungivorous nematode taxa. The indicator families observed in this research could be an interesting starting point for research targeting nematode feeding preferences. The fungal families boosted by 
 <italic>S. gigantea</italic> in a riparian habitat could be especially informative as Aphelenchidae and Aphelenchoididae showed a remarkable increase in these soils.
