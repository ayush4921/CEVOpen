<p>Ergosterol is a frequently used marker for the assessment of fungal biomass in soil. This sterol is found in all Ascomycota and most Basidiomycota. Several representatives of the Zygomycota harbour ergosterol in their membranes as well, but this sterol is absent in the more basal fungal lineages [

 <xref rid="B43-microorganisms-09-00437" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] showed a tight correlation between ergosterol content and fungal biomass. Given that the local fungal communities were dominated by later diverging divisions such as Ascomycota and Basidiomycota [
 <xref rid="B44-microorganisms-09-00437" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], ergosterol is considered to be an adequate marker for fungal biomass at these locations.
