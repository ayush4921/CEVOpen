<p>With regard to the use of rDNA as a marker for fungal biomass, it should be mentioned that genome-based surveys revealed considerable variation in rDNA copy numbers. Nevertheless, some phylum-specific characteristics have been observed. The average number of rDNA copies for Ascomycota is around 50 and shows limited variation. Basidiomycota harbor about twice as many rDNA copies, and this is accompanied by substantial copy number variation among its members [

Hence, rDNA copy numbers can only be used to assess fungal biomass in cases where there are no major differences between the community composition of the samples. The rDNA-based estimation of the Ascomycota is likely to be more accurate than the estimation of the Basidiomycota biomass. Although both ergosterol and rDNA copy number have their limitations as fungal biomass markers in soil, the comparisons of data from adjacent plots from the same habitat are probably valid. Fungi are known to be more plasticity with regard to the biomass:DNA ratio than many other organismal groups [
 <xref rid="B45-microorganisms-09-00437" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This is the result of the cellular organization of fungi. The hyphal compartmentalization of fungi might be impaired by the partial or complete removal of septa, cross walls separating the fungal cells [
 <xref rid="B46-microorganisms-09-00437" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Thus, growth of the mycelial network does not necessarily have to be accompanied by a comparable increase in the number of nuclei. Therefore, the difference in outcome between the two types of markers (biochemical or DNA-based) might be attributable to an increase in the fungal biomass:DNA ratio. Further research is required to investigate this hypothesis.
