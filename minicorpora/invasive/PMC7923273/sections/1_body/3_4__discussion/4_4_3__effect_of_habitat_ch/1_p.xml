<p>Despite the differences in floristic composition, soil type and land use history between the riparian zone and the semi-natural grasslands, the overall biotic impact of giant goldenrod induced similar overall invasion effects. Nevertheless, Basidiomycota were more abundant in semi-natural grasslands than in the riparian zones (

 <xref rid="microorganisms-09-00437-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). This could relate to a substantial pH difference. Whereas riparian zones had a relatively neutral pH of 7.5, semi-natural grasslands had a pH nearly 2 units lower. As compared to bacteria, pH windows for optimal growth are wider for fungi [

 <xref rid="B51-microorganisms-09-00437" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In the most acidic sites, Basidiomycota showed a higher relative abundance as compared to sites with more basic soils. The higher abundance in Basidiomycota in semi-natural grasslands did not result in a significant change in either of the fungivorous nematode lineages.
