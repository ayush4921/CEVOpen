0: The belowground effects of  S. gigantea invasions were examined at eight sites in the Netherlands, located in either of the distinct semi-natural habitats, namely riparian zones (rive clay soil) and semi-natural grasslands (sandy soil) (see  Table 1).
1: For all invaded plots, the coverage by  S. gigantea was scored as a 9 on a modified Braun-Blanquet scale [ 25, 26], implying a 75100% coverage.
2: Uninvaded plots were dominated by native plant species, and if  S. gigantea was present in the uninvaded plots, its coverage was neglectable.
