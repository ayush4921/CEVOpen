<p>The belowground effects of 
 <italic>S. gigantea</italic> invasions were examined at eight sites in the Netherlands, located in either of the distinct semi-natural habitats, namely riparian zones (rive clay soil) and semi-natural grasslands (sandy soil) (see 
 <xref rid="microorganisms-09-00437-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). For all invaded plots, the coverage by 
 <italic>S. gigantea</italic> was scored as a 9 on a modified Braun-Blanquet scale [
 <xref rid="B25-microorganisms-09-00437" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-microorganisms-09-00437" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], implying a 75â€“100% coverage. Uninvaded plots were dominated by native plant species, and if 
 <italic>S. gigantea</italic> was present in the uninvaded plots, its coverage was neglectable.
