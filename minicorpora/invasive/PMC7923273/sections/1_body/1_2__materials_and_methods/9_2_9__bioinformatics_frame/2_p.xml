<p>To investigate the indicator taxa involved in the differences in fungal communities between invaded and non-invaded plots, a linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) was conducted in Microbiome Analyst [
 <xref rid="B39-microorganisms-09-00437" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] to explore the differential microbial populations at the family level [
 <xref rid="B40-microorganisms-09-00437" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. A significance level of α ≤ 0.05 was used in this study.
