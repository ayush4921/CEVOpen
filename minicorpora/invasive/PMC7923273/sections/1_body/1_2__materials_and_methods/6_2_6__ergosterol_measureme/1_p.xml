<p>Ergosterol was extracted from 1 g of soil using the alkaline extraction method as described by [
 <xref rid="B31-microorganisms-09-00437" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In a mixture of alkaline methanol and cyclohexane, ergosterol accumulated in the cyclohexane phase. After phase separation, the cyclohexane was removed by evaporation, and ergosterol was re-dissolved in methanol. Subsequently, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with photodiode array detection was used to separate and quantify the ergosterol content of the samples as described by [
