0: Ergosterol was extracted from 1 g of soil using the alkaline extraction method as described by [ 31].
1: In a mixture of alkaline methanol and cyclohexane, ergosterol accumulated in the cyclohexane phase.
2: After phase separation, the cyclohexane was removed by evaporation, and ergosterol was re-dissolved in methanol.
3: Subsequently, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with photodiode array detection was used to separate and quantify the ergosterol content of the samples as described by [ 32].
