<p>In total, 104 composite soil samples were collected from 52 plot-pairs in November 2014. Four plot-pairs were sampled at sites due to the limited number of 
 <italic>S. gigantea</italic> patches (see also 
 <xref rid="microorganisms-09-00437-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Each plot-pair consisted of two directly neighbouring 2 × 2 m plots to minimize possible differences in soil type and structure. To average microscale variation, 12 soil cores (depth: 25 cm, ø 1.5 cm) were randomly collected within each plot and mixed. Sampling material was thoroughly cleaned between plot-pairs in order to limit cross contamination. On the day of sample collection, composite soil samples were split into two subsamples (200 g and 5 g). The 200 g subsample was stored at 4 °C for subsequent nematode extraction and the determination of abiotic soil characteristics. The other subsamples (5g) for ergosterol and DNA extraction were stored at –20 °C to prevent DNA degradation.
