0: In total, 104 composite soil samples were collected from 52 plot-pairs in November 2014.
1: Four plot-pairs were sampled at sites due to the limited number of  S. gigantea patches (see also  Table 1).
2: Each plot-pair consisted of two directly neighbouring 2  2 m plots to minimize possible differences in soil type and structure.
3: To average microscale variation, 12 soil cores (depth: 25 cm,  1.5 cm) were randomly collected within each plot and mixed.
4: Sampling material was thoroughly cleaned between plot-pairs in order to limit cross contamination.
5: On the day of sample collection, composite soil samples were split into two subsamples (200 g and 5 g).
6: The 200 g subsample was stored at 4 C for subsequent nematode extraction and the determination of abiotic soil characteristics.
7: The other subsamples (5g) for ergosterol and DNA extraction were stored at 20 C to prevent DNA degradation.
