0: The variable V7-V8 of fungal 18S was utilized as a target for the analyses of Illumina 18S rDNA sequencing.
1: To prepare the samples for sequencing, a twostep PCR procedure was followed as described in [ 33].
2: First, a locus-specific primer combination extended with an Illumina read area and the appropriate adapter were used to produce primary amplicons in triplicate for all samples.
3: PCR 2 was then conducted on 40 diluted amplicons of PCR1 to attach the Illumina index and the Illumina sequencing adaptor.
4: Randomly picked products of PCR 1 and 2 were checked on gel to ensure that amplification would be successful.
5: Finally, all PCR products were pooled and sent for sequencing.
6: Sequencing was done at Bioscience (Wageningen Research, Wageningen, The Netherlands) using the Illumina MiSeq Desktop Sequencer (2  250 nt paired-end sequencing) according to the standard protocols.
7: The raw sequences were submitted to the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database under study accession numbers PRJNA563313.
