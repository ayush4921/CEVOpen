<p>The variable V7-V8 of fungal 18S was utilized as a target for the analyses of Illumina 18S rDNA sequencing. To prepare the samples for sequencing, a twostep PCR procedure was followed as described in [
 <xref rid="B33-microorganisms-09-00437" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. First, a locus-specific primer combination extended with an Illumina read area and the appropriate adapter were used to produce primary amplicons in triplicate for all samples. PCR 2 was then conducted on 40× diluted amplicons of PCR1 to attach the Illumina index and the Illumina sequencing adaptor. Randomly picked products of PCR 1 and 2 were checked on gel to ensure that amplification would be successful. Finally, all PCR products were pooled and sent for sequencing. Sequencing was done at Bioscience (Wageningen Research, Wageningen, The Netherlands) using the Illumina MiSeq Desktop Sequencer (2 × 250 nt paired-end sequencing) according to the standard protocols. The raw sequences were submitted to the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database under study accession numbers PRJNA563313.
