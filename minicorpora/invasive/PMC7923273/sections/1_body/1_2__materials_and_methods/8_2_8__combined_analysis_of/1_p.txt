0: The impact of  S. gigantea invasion on abiotic soil properties and the densities of nematodes, fungi, and bacteria was analysed using mixed linear models (PROC MIXED, SAS software system version 9.2) [ 34].
1: When residuals did not approximate normal distributions, transformed data were used.
2: OM, total C, total N, nematode densities, and densities of fungi and bacteria were log-transformed.
3: A constant of 0.1 was added prior to the log-transformation to bypass any zero values.
4: This was done for Aphelenchidae, Aphelenchoididae,  Diphtherophora, and Chytridiomycota.
