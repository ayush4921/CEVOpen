<p>A split-plot design was used for all ten study sites, with sampling sites forming the main plots, associated with the factor habitat type (riparian vegetation or semi-natural grassland). Two subplots per plot pair were associated with the factor plant invasion. This design was represented in the mixed models with random effects for sites, plot-pairs, and individual plots forming the random part of the model. The main effects of habitat type, invasion, and interaction between both factors formed the fixed part of the model. Random effects for site, plot-pairs, and individual plots formed the random part of the model. In this way, the total error variance was split into variance components for sites, plot-pairs within sites, and for individual plots within plot-pairs. Regarding pH, the mixed model took into account that variances were different for riparian vegetation habitats and semi-natural grasslands (as was noticed from residual plots). Hypothesis tests (with F-test statistics) for the significance of the main effects of habitat type, invasion, and their interaction on the soil variables were performed. 
 <italic>p</italic>-values &lt; 0.05 were considered significant. Regardless of the outcome of hypothesis tests on interaction and main effects, comparisons between invaded and uninvaded plots were made per habitat type, using F-tests. The results were presented as (back transformed) 95% confidence intervals for the estimated mean responses of the soil variables (obtained from “least squares means” outputs) in invaded and uninvaded plots per habitat type. Moreover, invasion impacts on soil variables were presented as ratios between estimated means of invaded plots and uninvaded plots.
