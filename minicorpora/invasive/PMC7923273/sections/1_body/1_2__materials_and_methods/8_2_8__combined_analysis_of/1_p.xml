<p>The impact of 
 <italic>S. gigantea</italic> invasion on abiotic soil properties and the densities of nematodes, fungi, and bacteria was analysed using mixed linear models (PROC MIXED, SAS software system version 9.2) [
 <xref rid="B34-microorganisms-09-00437" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. When residuals did not approximate normal distributions, transformed data were used. OM, total C, total N, nematode densities, and densities of fungi and bacteria were log-transformed. A constant of 0.1 was added prior to the log-transformation to bypass any zero values. This was done for Aphelenchidae, Aphelenchoididae, 
 <italic>Diphtherophora</italic>, and Chytridiomycota.
