0: A split-plot design was used for all ten study sites, with sampling sites forming the main plots, associated with the factor habitat type (riparian vegetation or semi-natural grassland).
1: Two subplots per plot pair were associated with the factor plant invasion.
2: This design was represented in the mixed models with random effects for sites, plot-pairs, and individual plots forming the random part of the model.
3: The main effects of habitat type, invasion, and interaction between both factors formed the fixed part of the model.
4: Random effects for site, plot-pairs, and individual plots formed the random part of the model.
5: In this way, the total error variance was split into variance components for sites, plot-pairs within sites, and for individual plots within plot-pairs.
6: Regarding pH, the mixed model took into account that variances were different for riparian vegetation habitats and semi-natural grasslands (as was noticed from residual plots).
7: Hypothesis tests (with F-test statistics) for the significance of the main effects of habitat type, invasion, and their interaction on the soil variables were performed.
8: p-values< 0.05 were considered significant.
9: Regardless of the outcome of hypothesis tests on interaction and main effects, comparisons between invaded and uninvaded plots were made per habitat type, using F-tests.
10: The results were presented as (back transformed) 95% confidence intervals for the estimated mean responses of the soil variables (obtained from least squares means outputs) in invaded and uninvaded plots per habitat type.
11: Moreover, invasion impacts on soil variables were presented as ratios between estimated means of invaded plots and uninvaded plots.
