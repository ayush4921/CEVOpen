<p>Due to the substantial variation estimation in rDNA copy numbers in fungi, using only the ITS marker might not be appropriate for all fungal clades. Therefore, two qPCR assays for single-copy protein coding genes were included in this study (beta-tubulin (tub2) and the translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1)) since these genes are supposed to be less variable and occur as a single copy in fungi [
