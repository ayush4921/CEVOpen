0: Fungal and bacterial DNA was extracted from 0.25 g of subsamples using the PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (MO BIO Laboratories, Carlsbad, California, USA).
1: Slight changes were made to the manufacturers protocol.
2: PowerBead Tubes were placed in a Qiagen Tissue Lyser for 7 min instead of 10 min to compensate for the high shaking frequency (30 Hz); 20 L of internal control DNA (20.6 ng/L calf thymus DNA) was added to each sample in order to monitor DNA losses during extraction and purification.
3: To further reduce the impact of soil-derived PCR-inhibiting components, purified lysates were diluted 100 times.
4: Diluted purified lysates were stored at 4 C until quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis and sequencing.
5: Undiluted purified lysates were stored at 20 C. Microbial communities were analysed using qPCR assays targeting total fungi (ITS1F/5.8 s) and total bacteria (16S ribosomal RNA) as well as three fungal phyla: Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Chytridiomycota (based on taxon-characteristic ITS regions).
6: qPCR primers, qPCR conditions, and slope and intercept values describing the relationship between Ct-values and concentration of target bacterial or fungal DNA (ng/L) were determined according to Harkes et al.
7: [ 29].
