0: Due to the substantial variation estimation in rDNA copy numbers in fungi, using only the ITS marker might not be appropriate for all fungal clades.
1: Therefore, two qPCR assays for single-copy protein coding genes were included in this study (beta-tubulin (tub2) and the translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1)) since these genes are supposed to be less variable and occur as a single copy in fungi [ 30].
