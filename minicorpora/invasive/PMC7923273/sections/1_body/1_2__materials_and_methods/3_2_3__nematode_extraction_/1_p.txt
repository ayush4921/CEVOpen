0: Nematodes were extracted from a 100 g subsample within one week after sample collection using an Oostenbrink elutriator [ 27].
1: DNA extractions of the total nematode suspensions were performed as described by Vervoort et al.
2: [ 28].
3: At the start of this extraction procedure, 25 L of calf thymus DNA (20.6 ng/L) was added to each sample to be able to quantify DNA loss after extraction and purification.
4: After purification, each sample was diluted 10 times and stored at 20 C until further use.
5: Diluted DNA extracts served as a template for the quantitative PCR (qPCR)-based determination of the total nematode density and the densities of the three major fungivorous nematode lineages present at these locations, namely Aphelenchidae, Aphelenchoididae, and  Diphtherophora.
6: This qPCR detection method is based on taxon-specific SSU rDNA sequence motifs as previously described [ 28].
