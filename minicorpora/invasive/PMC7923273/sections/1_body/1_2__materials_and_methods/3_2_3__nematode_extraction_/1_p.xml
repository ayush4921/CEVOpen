<p>Nematodes were extracted from a 100 g subsample within one week after sample collection using an Oostenbrink elutriator [
 <xref rid="B27-microorganisms-09-00437" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. DNA extractions of the total nematode suspensions were performed as described by Vervoort et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-microorganisms-09-00437" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. At the start of this extraction procedure, 25 µL of calf thymus DNA (20.6 ng/µL) was added to each sample to be able to quantify DNA loss after extraction and purification. After purification, each sample was diluted 10 times and stored at −20 °C until further use. Diluted DNA extracts served as a template for the quantitative PCR (qPCR)-based determination of the total nematode density and the densities of the three major fungivorous nematode lineages present at these locations, namely Aphelenchidae, Aphelenchoididae, and 
 <italic>Diphtherophora</italic>. This qPCR detection method is based on taxon-specific SSU rDNA sequence motifs as previously described [
