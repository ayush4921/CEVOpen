<p>Soil moisture content was measured for each sample by determining the sample’s weight loss after 20 h at 105 °C. Dried soil was sieved with a mesh of 2 mm and 10 g of dried soil was added to 25 mL demineralized water for soil pH measurements using a gel-electrolyte electrode (Sentix 21, WTW, Weilheim, Germany). Organic matter content was determined by measuring weight loss in 20 g of sieved soil after 5 h at 550 °C. </p>
