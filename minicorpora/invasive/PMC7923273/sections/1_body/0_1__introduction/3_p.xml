<p>In previous studies on the belowground effects of the invasive giant goldenrod, a local increase in the overall fungal biomass was detected, both in a mesocosm experiment [

 <xref rid="B20-microorganisms-09-00437" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The total fungal biomass was assessed using ergosterol, a biochemical marker for higher fungi, or PLFA 18:2ω6. Ergosterol is a valid marker for major fungal groups such as Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, but it should be noted that some fungal groups such as the Glomeromycota—which form arbuscular mycorrhizas—and the Chytridiomycota lack this sterol in their cell membranes [
 <xref rid="B21-microorganisms-09-00437" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. On the other hand, PLFA 18:2ω6 has been found in various plant species. Each method to estimate fungal biomass comes with its own limitations.
