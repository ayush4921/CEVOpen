0: Here, we investigated the impact of invasive  S. gigantea on local fungal communities in more detail.
1: First, we verified whether the  S. gigantea-induced increase in fungal biomass was transient or long-lasting.
2: To confirm this, soil samples were collected at the end of the growing season (November).
3: Second, ribosomal DNA-based markers were used along with ergosterol to characterize changes in the fungal community.
4: The use of two independent markers for fungal biomass provided a more solid basis for our findings, and fungal division-specific markers allowed us to characterize the impact qualitatively.
5: To further characterize the fungal community, ribosomal DNA amplicons were sequenced.
6: In addition, we checked whether representatives of the next trophic level, fungivorous nematodes, were affected.
7: Two out of the three nematode lineages present in these sites were stimulated in the presence of giant goldenrod.
8: Possible explanations for these interesting but diverse results are discussed.
