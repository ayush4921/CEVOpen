 <italic>Solidago gigantea</italic> is a rhizomatous perennial herb, native to North America [
 <xref rid="B7-microorganisms-09-00437" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It was introduced in Europe as an ornamental plant and rapidly became invasive in Europe and parts of Asia, quickly becoming one of Europeâ€™s most detrimental plant invaders [
 <xref rid="B8-microorganisms-09-00437" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In North America, 
 <italic>S. gigantea</italic> prefers wetlands, whilst in Europe it can survive under a broad range of light intensities, soil moistures, temperatures, nutrient conditions, and pH [
 <xref rid="B9-microorganisms-09-00437" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In its native habitat, 
 <italic>S. gigantea</italic> is colonized by mycorrhizal fungi [
 <xref rid="B10-microorganisms-09-00437" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Zubek et al. showed that giant goldenrod also interacted with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) outside its native range, and the AMF colonization rates were higher in invaded plots as compared to neighbouring, uninvaded plots [
 <xref rid="B11-microorganisms-09-00437" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Additionally, shared mycorrhizal networks between plants showed an increased growth and nutrient acquisition by invasive 
 <italic>Solidago canadensis</italic> at the expense of the native plant 
 <italic>Kummerowia striata</italic> [
 <xref rid="B12-microorganisms-09-00437" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. AMF have also been shown to stimulate the decomposition of plant material [
 <xref rid="B13-microorganisms-09-00437" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-microorganisms-09-00437" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-microorganisms-09-00437" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Although the exact mechanisms of this effect are unknown, it is hypothesised that AMF export nitrogen from litter and slowly release low concentrations of labile C, thereby altering the relative abundance of saprotrophic microbial communities in soil [
 <xref rid="B15-microorganisms-09-00437" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-microorganisms-09-00437" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These observations show that plant mycorrhizal status might be linked to the success of plant invasion [
 <xref rid="B17-microorganisms-09-00437" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-microorganisms-09-00437" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Since 
 <italic>S. gigantea</italic> is a rhizomatous perennial herb that forms nearly pure monoculture stands in various habitats, giant goldenrod is an appropriate species to use to study the effect of invasive plants on soil biota.
