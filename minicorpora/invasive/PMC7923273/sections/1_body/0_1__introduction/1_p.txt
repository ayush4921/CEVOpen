0: Invasive plants pose a threat to the biodiversity of natural ecosystems [ 1].
1: Aboveground observations have often revealed that invasive plants reduce species richness of the native plant community [ 2].
2: Belowground, invasive plants can change physical conditions and the composition of soil biota, thereby even negatively affecting the soil biological conditions for the native plant community, making the restoration of the original vegetation more difficult [ 3].
3: Although invasion can change ecological links, it is still unclear how invasive plant species modify soil community composition, diversity, structure, and function [ 4].
4: Understanding the mechanisms contributing to the success of plant invasion is critical for ecosystem conservation [ 5].
5: Therefore, we need to identify the community- and ecosystem-level effects of the invasive species and discover which traits enable its invasive success [ 6].
