<p>Here, we investigated the impact of invasive 
 <italic>S. gigantea</italic> on local fungal communities in more detail. First, we verified whether the 
 <italic>S. gigantea</italic>-induced increase in fungal biomass was transient or long-lasting. To confirm this, soil samples were collected at the end of the growing season (November). Second, ribosomal DNA-based markers were used along with ergosterol to characterize changes in the fungal community. The use of two independent markers for fungal biomass provided a more solid basis for our findings, and fungal division-specific markers allowed us to characterize the impact qualitatively. To further characterize the fungal community, ribosomal DNA amplicons were sequenced. In addition, we checked whether representatives of the next trophic level, fungivorous nematodes, were affected. Two out of the three nematode lineages present in these sites were stimulated in the presence of giant goldenrod. Possible explanations for these interesting but diverse results are discussed.
