<p>The ergosterol-based observation of the increase in the fungal biomass a 
 <italic>S. gigantea</italic>, could not be confirmed by DNA markers. Both qPCR-based assessment of total fungal DNA as well as the characterization of the fungal communities on the basis of variable 18S rDNA regions did not reveal a difference in fungal DNA content between 
 <italic>S. gigantea</italic>-invaded and uninvaded plots. The apparent discrepancy might be attributable to a change in the DNA:biomass ratio. High throughput sequencing of the 18S rDNA regions V7-V8 revealed a stimulation of Cladosporiaceae and Glomeraceae and a suppression of the Cucurbitariaceae as a result of giant goldenrod invasion. Further investigation into the nature of these community shifts might elucidate the observed change in fungal DNA:biomass ratio induced by the invasive plant species 
 <italic>S. gigantea</italic>.
