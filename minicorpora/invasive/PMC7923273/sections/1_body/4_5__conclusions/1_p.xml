<p>This study shows that 
 <italic>S. gigantea</italic> invasion has a structural impact on the belowground soil community by increasing the fungal biomass independent of the sampling moment, sampling year, or habitat. The increase of fungal biomass is reflected in the next trophic level by a boost of two independent lineages of fungivorous nematodes, Aphelenchidae and Aphelenchoididae.
