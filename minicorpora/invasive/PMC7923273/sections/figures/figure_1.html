 <caption> Impact of S. gigantea invasion in riparian vegetation (top) and semi-natural grassland habitat. The impact of S. gigantea invasion on the y-axis was calculated by dividing estimated means ( Table 3) from invaded plots by estimated means from un-invaded plots and expressed as a percentage. Impacts are shown for the 6 abiotic variables, the total nematode density, densities of three fungivorous nematodes, total fungal density, densities of three fungal phyla and the total bacterial density (no invasion impact = 100%). Asterisks indicate significant differences (* p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, *** p &lt; 0.001) between invaded and un-invaded plots per habitat type. Variables showing an overall significant invasion effect, for both habitats together, are indicated by a grey-shaded background. Corresponding p-values are shown at the top part of the figure (NS = not significant). Riparian vegetation habitats included 3 study sites and 24 plot-pairs, while semi-natural grasslands included 5 study sites and 28 plot-pairs. </caption>
