 <p>C.W.Q., M.T.W.V., and J.H. were responsible for the experimental design. L.J.M.v.H., M.T.W.V., and C.W.Q. collected the soil samples. L.J.M.v.H. and S.J.J.v.d.E. isolated nematode DNA and performed the nematode qPCR assays. L.J.M.v.H. measured soil abiotic characters. M.H.M.H. and P.J.W.M. developed fungal qPCR primers. P.H. tested fungal qPCR assays. P.H., L.J.M.v.H. isolated bacterial and fungal DNA. P.H. performed the bacterial and fungal qPCR assays. P.H. performed the ergosterol measurements. G.G. performed the statistical analysis in SAS on the qPCR and ergosterol data. P.H. performed the two step PCR reactions in order to prepare the sequence library. J.J.M.v.S. analysed the fungal sequence data and performed the statistical analysis. P.H., J.H. wrote the manuscript; all others commented on the manuscript. All authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript.</p>
