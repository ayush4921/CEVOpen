0: Both oxyfluorfen and oxadiazon, were applied in a tank mix with the nonionic surfactant alkyl phenol ethylene oxide (Shatah 90 , ADAMA-Makhteshim, Israel).
1: The effect of increasing surfactant concentrations on  S. rostratum control was evaluated.
2: Plants from both populations, GY and GO, reacted similarly to oxadiazon at heights of 89 cm ( Table 1).
3: However, plants from the GY population were less responsive to oxyfluorfen at the later growth stage.
4: Thus, advanced growth stage plants from the GY population were chosen for this experiment.
5: Plants were treated with three different surfactant concentrations (0.25%, 0.5% and 1%), applied with or without oxyfluorfen and oxadiazon (at recommended field rate;  Table 3).
6: Experiments were conducted as specified above.
7: Shoot fresh weight and survival rate were recorded for each plant 21 DAT.
