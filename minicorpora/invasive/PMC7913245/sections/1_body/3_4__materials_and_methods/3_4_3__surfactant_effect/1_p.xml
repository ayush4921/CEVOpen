<p>Both oxyfluorfen and oxadiazon, were applied in a tank mix with the nonionic surfactant alkyl phenol ethylene oxide (Shatah 90

Thus, advanced growth stage plants from the GY population were chosen for this experiment. Plants were treated with three different surfactant concentrations (0.25%, 0.5% and 1%), applied with or without oxyfluorfen and oxadiazon (at recommended field rate;
