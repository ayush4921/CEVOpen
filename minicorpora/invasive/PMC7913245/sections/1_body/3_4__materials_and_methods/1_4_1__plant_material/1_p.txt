0: As  S. rostratum seeds possess high dormancy, which may prevent their germination [ 24], the presented herbicide application tests used field-collected seedlings.
1: Seedling were collected from two fields presenting high infestation of  S. rostratum, located near Moshav Givat Yoav (GY) (32.8012266548, 35.6977272346) and Kibbutz Ginegar (GO) (32.6543271802, 35.2488696828) ( Figure 1).
2: To ensure appropriate representation of the field population, seedlings at the three-four leaf stage were randomly selected from each field population.
3: Seedlings were then transplanted into 250 mL pots filled with commercial potting medium (Tuff, Marom Golan, Israel), including Osmocote  slow-release fertilizer, at the New-Yaar Research Center.
4: Plants were maintained in a greenhouse under Israeli summer conditions and watered daily.
