0: Experiments were carried out in the summer of 2020, in a greenhouse at the Newe-Yaar Research Center, under natural conditions.
1: Plants from both GY and GO populations were sprayed when reaching heights of 45 cm and 89 cm.
2: Experiments were spaced in time such that plants from the first group (45 cm) were sprayed two weeks prior to plants from the second group (89 cm).
3: Plants were treated with eight different herbicides at the recommended field rate as specified in  Table 3, using a chain-driven sprayer delivering 300 L ha 1, with a flat-fan 8001E nozzle (TeeJet , Spraying Systems Co., Wheaton, IL, USA).
4: All experiments were arranged in a fully randomized-factorial design, with eight to ten replicates for each treatment.
5: Shoot fresh weight of each plant was recorded 21 days after treatment (DAT).
