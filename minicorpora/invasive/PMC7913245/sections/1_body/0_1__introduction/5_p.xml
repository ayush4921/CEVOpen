 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00284-f001">Figure 1</xref>), this research aimed to evaluate the efficacy of herbicides with differing modes of action for the control of 
 <italic>S. rostratum</italic> at different growth stages. In addition, it assessed the additive effect of surfactant to PPO inhibitors in
