0: Studies relating to  S. rostratum management approaches are scarce, warranting research into optimal weed control strategies, especially herbicide application.
1: In two field experiments conducted at Nebraska and Wyoming, broadleaf weed control was tested as part of an overall strategy to reduce  S. rostratum infestation in two summer cereal crops, proso ( Panicum miliaceum L.) and foxtail millet ( Setaria italica P.
2: Beauv.)
3: [ 9].
4: Treatments with carfentrazone-ethyl [protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO) inhibitor (group E), combined with either 2,4-D amine (auxin inhibitor; group O) or prosulfuron (acetolactate synthase inhibitor; group B), were highly effective in controlling  S. rostratum plants.
5: In Israel, PPO inhibitors such as oxyfluorfen and oxadiazon are registered for use in both onion and tomato, while carfentrazone-ethyl is registered for use in chickpea.
6: Although the oxyfluorfen or oxadiazon herbicide labels do not require the addition of a surfactant, previous research suggested that the effectiveness of PPO inhibitors may be ameliorated by the addition of a nonionic surfactant to the tank mix [ 10, 11].
