7: These troublesome weeds infest pastures, crops, roadsides and natural habitats.
8: Their distribution range is quite different as  S. elaeagnifolium has become widely spread, while  S. rostratum remains of limited dispersal.
9: However, in the last 10 years the distribution of  S. rostratum increased, especially in agricultural habitats.
