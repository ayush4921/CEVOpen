<p>The family of 
 <italic>Solanaceae</italic> counts many species widespread worldwide, either wild or cultivated [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-10-00284" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. These species are of international importance and numerous studies related to their biology and ecology as crops and weeds have been conducted. Several of these species, such as the subgenus of prickly nightshades (
 <italic>Solanum</italic> spp.: subgenus 
 <italic>Leptostemonum</italic>) are considered as significant invasive species in many parts of the world [
 <xref rid="B2-plants-10-00284" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-plants-10-00284" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Originated from of the southeastern US, these species include some of the most noxious weeds worldwide [
 <xref rid="B3-plants-10-00284" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Two prickly nightshades, 
 <italic>S. elaeagnifolium</italic> Cav. and 
 <italic>S. rostratum</italic> Dunal, invaded Israel in the 1950s [
 <xref rid="B4-plants-10-00284" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. These troublesome weeds infest pastures, crops, roadsides and natural habitats. Their distribution range is quite different as 
 <italic>S. elaeagnifolium</italic> has become widely spread, while 
 <italic>S. rostratum</italic> remains of limited dispersal. However, in the last 10 years the distribution of 
 <italic>S. rostratum</italic> increased, especially in agricultural habitats.
