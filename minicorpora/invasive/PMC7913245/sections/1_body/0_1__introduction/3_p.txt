0: Although  S. rostratum is highly abundant in China, it is usually found in open, disturbed habitats, such as roadsides, fallow fields and field margins [ 6].
1: In the US, this weed was reported as an agricultural pest in Oklahoma [ 8], Nebraska and Wyoming [ 9].
2: Field experiments conducted in cotton ( Gossypium hirsutum L.) fields in Oklahoma showed that crop plant heights were decreased at greater densities of  S. rostratum [ 8].
3: In the same study, yield reduction was also observed, with a damage of 480 kg ha 1 at a weed density of 64 plants/10 m row.
4: In Israel,  S. rostratum was first documented at the Jezreel Valley in 1953 [ 4].
5: Since then, several field populations were located in the Jordan Valley, the Golan Heights, the Hulla Valley and at the Mediterranean Sea coastline ( Figure 1).
6: S. rostratum may appear in several germination flashes, starting from spring and continuing throughout the summer; thus, both young and mature plants may coexist at the same field.
7: Different sensitivity levels between young and mature  S. rostratum plants can reduce the effectiveness of chemical weed control.
