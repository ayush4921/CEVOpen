<p>The addition of surfactant to the herbicide treatments resulted in an increased sensitivity of the large size (8–9 cm) 
 <italic>S. rostratum</italic> plants to both oxadiazon and oxyfluorfen (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00284-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The application of 0.25% or 0.5% surfactant alone did not result in a significant reduction in shoot fresh weight compared with the control. Remarkably, the use of 1% surfactant alone resulted in an approximate 35% reduction in plant biomass, without affecting plant survival. The effective surfactant concentration that increased herbicide activity was different for the two herbicides. When applying oxadiazon with surfactant, shoot biomass declined by to 28 ± 8.0% of untreated controls when applied with 1% surfactant dose and to 9.9 ± 3.6% when applied with 0.5% surfactant (

When combined with oxyfluorfen, the 0.5% surfactant concentration resulted in a final shoot fresh weight of 6.6 ± 4.4% in comparison to the controls, while the 1% dose brought to a final shoot biomass that was 3.4 ± 3.4% of the untreated control (
