<p>The comparison of fresh final shoot weight indicated that plant response was significantly affected by both the specific herbicides and growth stage of the weed at the time of application. For plants that were sprayed at the 4–5 cm growth stage, both clomazone and rimsulfuron showed low efficacy in reducing plant final weight, with mean shoot fresh weights measuring 79.5% and 93.8%, respectively, of the untreated control (

For plants treated at the 8–9 cm growth stage, low efficacy was recorded for almost all tested herbicides, with the exception of carfentrazone-ethyl, which reduced mean shoot fresh weight down to 0.2% of that of the control plants (

Metribuzin and tembutrione showed the same response as oxadiazon and oxyfluorfen and, while achieving high control at the 4–5 cm growth stage, at the 8–9 cm growth stage, the two herbicides provided poor weed control.
