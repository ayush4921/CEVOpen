<p>For most herbicides, no significant differences in plant response were recorded at the 4–5 cm growth stage (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00284-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Clomazone was more effective in controlling plants from the GY population, while clopyralid was more effective in controlling plants of the GO population. However, while differences between populations, overall, both herbicides showed poor performances in controlling GO and GY plants at the 4–5 cm growth stage (clomazone 79.5% vs. 36.4% and clopyralid 42.5% vs. 60.1%, respectively). For the 8–9 cm growth stage, differences among populations were more significant, with metribuzin, oxyfluorfen rimsulfuron and tembutrione all showing differences in control efficacy of GO vs. GY plants. Although differences were significant, herbicide efficacy rates were still low, as shown by the high mean shoot fresh weight (
