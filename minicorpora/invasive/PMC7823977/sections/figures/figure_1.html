 <caption> Potential effects of invasive plants on mosquito life-history traits. ( a) Invasive plants offer suitable oviposition sites for some vector species; ( b) invasive plant litter increases proliferation of immature vectors; ( c) dense canopy cover or thickets of invasive plants provide suitable micro-habitats for adult mosquitoes; ( d) nectariferous flowers ( e) and extra-floral glands of invasive plants are important sugar sources for adult vectors; ( f) invasive plants can influence the pathogen transmission ability of the vector.
