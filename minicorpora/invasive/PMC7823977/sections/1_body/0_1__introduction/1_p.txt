0: Large-scale land-use changes, especially as a result of a drive towards agricultural intensification and expansion, are progressively re-shaping the future of rural Africa.
1: The prime driver of this change remains the need to improve food security given the high population growth on the continent, leading to an estimated doubling of the population by 2050 [ 1].
2: Agricultural practices in Africa may have unintended health implications by driving the emergence of arthropod borne diseases [ 2].
3: Many important zoonotic diseases caused by arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) like Rift valley fever (RVF), West Nile, dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya, and Zika originated in Africa, and their initial emergence might have remained unnoticed as human encroachment into natural ecosystems, deforestation, and agricultural transformation was taking place.
4: Yet, the arthropod vectors that transmit these arboviruses are particularly sensitive to land-use changes [ 3, 4, 5] and can quickly adapt to changing ecosystems by altering key aspects of their bionomics.
