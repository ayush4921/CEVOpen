<p>Annual and perennial herbs mainly colonize ruderal (disturbed) places such as roadsides, quarries, and construction places [

 <italic>Parthenium hysterophorus</italic>. Because these weeds are short-lived and often outcompeted by perennial forbs and woods, their effects on the environment are usually neglected. However, of emerging ecological concern is
