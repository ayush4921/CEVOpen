<p>Besides the oviposition altering properties of plant debris in vector breeding sites, histopathological evidence showed that consumption of decaying plant leaves by larvae of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti, Ae. albopictus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> affected their midgut epithelial cells [
 <xref rid="B77-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Disruption of the midgut epithelial cells may interfere with immature development, adult emergence, and possibly pathogen transmission abilities [
 <xref rid="B78-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Though this does not directly point to all IAPs, it is known that the aquatic IAP 
 <italic>Eichhornia crassipes</italic> is able to affect the midgut epithelia tissue of 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> [
 <xref rid="B79-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. In addition, the fact that leaf litter of certain IAPs enhances the abundance of 
 <italic>Culex</italic> spp. and 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], makes it particularly interesting to investigate whether these plants also affect the adult vectorsâ€™ fitness and susceptibility to viral pathogens.
