<p>Thus, based on the recent promising results regarding malaria vectors [

 <xref rid="B80-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>], the potential suppressing or even enhancing properties of secondary plant metabolites on arbovirus vectors, especially those found in aggressively spreading IAPs in Africa, demands greater scientific attention. This should be accompanied by more detailed studies on plant feeding preferences in arboviral mosquito vectors, including the dengue vector
