 <italic>Opuntia ficus-indica</italic> was widely introduced throughout the world as a commercial fruit, fodder crop, ornamental, and “natural fence” [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Mature fruits from 
 <italic>O. ficus-indica</italic> contain high amounts of reducing sugars (glucose and fructose), and field caught 
 <italic>Ae. mcintoshi</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. ochraceus</italic>, the primary RVFV vectors, have been reported to feed on the plant [
 <xref rid="B74-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Yet, how and to what extend this might affect mosquito survival remains to be investigated. Like many other IAPs, 
 <italic>O. ficus-indica</italic> and the congener 
 <italic>O. stricta</italic> invade protected, disturbed, or abandoned agricultural lands and eventually replace native vegetations [

 <xref rid="B43-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. As it also forms impenetrable thickets, 
 <italic>O. ficus-indica</italic> might provide arboviral mosquito vectors with favourable habitats in otherwise inhospitable semi-arid environments. Yet, apart from initial observations by Nyasembe et al. ([
 <xref rid="B74-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] little is known on the relationship between 
 <italic>O. ficus-indica</italic> and arboviral mosquito vectors. We hypothesize that 
 <italic>Ae. mcintosh</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. ochraceus,</italic> sugar-feeding on 
 <italic>Opuntia</italic> spp., offer these RVFV vectors a competitive advantage in their survival and reproductive fitness compared to naturally occurring plants. However, experimental survival analyses to support this hypothesis are so far lacking.
