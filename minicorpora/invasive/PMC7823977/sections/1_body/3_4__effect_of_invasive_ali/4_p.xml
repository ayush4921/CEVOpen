 <italic>Parthenium hysterophorus</italic> has the ability to suppress the growth of vegetation in a wide range of ecosystems, which has enabled its vast spread in Africa. Its wide occurrence around homes, crop-, and rangelands, partly as a result of agricultural intensification measures like irrigation, may favour plant feeding by mosquitoes. In fact, the malaria vector 
 <italic>An. gambiae</italic> preferentially feeds on 
 <italic>P. hysterophorus</italic>, but not because of its nutritional value, which turned out to be rather inferior for 
 <italic>An. gambiae</italic> [

 <xref rid="B9-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B69-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], but possibly because of its attractive odour [
 <xref rid="B70-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] or the anti-plasmodium properties of some of its secondary plant metabolites [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] (further discussed in the next section). Thus, plant-feeding on 
 <italic>P. hysterophorus</italic> could potentially suppress vector populations over time through negative effects on the fitness of the females [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B69-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Yet, Nyasembe et al. [
 <xref rid="B71-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] found that 
 <italic>An. gambiae</italic> after feeding on 
 <italic>P. hysterophorus</italic> actually survived better and hypothesized that this could negatively impact malaria control in Africa. In addition, higher human biting rates were recorded among malaria vectors exposed to sugar-poor IAPs like 
 <italic>P. hysterophorus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], thereby increasing the risk of vector-borne disease spread. While it is important to resolve the ambiguity around 
 <italic>P. hysterophorus</italic> in terms of its potential effect on the risk of malaria transmission, it is worth noting that research on 
 <italic>P. hysterophorus</italic> has so far been limited to 
 <italic>An. gambiae</italic>. To investigate if 
 <italic>P. hysterophorus</italic> will have a similar effect on arboviral vectors, it will be important to conduct studies to show if arboviral vectors feed on this plant, and if so, then followed by an assessment of the effect on vector survival and reproductive fitness.
