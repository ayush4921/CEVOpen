<p id="Par14">The role of local adaptation and natural selection is often mentioned to explain the distribution range. The individuals that reached Argentina (located in the established range) were probably pre-adapted to the environmental conditions of the new range due to the rapid evolution of some traits. In this sense, the increase of leaf area could be advantageous, since water availability and temperatures in Argentina are similar to those in the native range; therefore, selection would have favored the photosynthetic capacity
