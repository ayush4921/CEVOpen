<p id="Par15">In the range edge, directional selection tended to reduce leaf area. These populations occur under environmental conditions characterized by drought and high temperatures; therefore, a reduced leaf area can prevent water evaporation. Likewise, length of internodes and inflorescences was also reduced, likely due to the windy conditions and higher altitudes prevailing in this region. Similar results have been reported in populations of

 </sup>, where the increasing altitude was found to negatively affect plant height and above-ground biomass. Finally, the reduction of these structures can be offset by the increase in the number of heads driven by directional selection. This compensation ensures the scattering of a greater number of diaspores.
