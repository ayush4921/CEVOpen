<p id="Par13">Because phenotypic expression is the result of the interaction between genetic components and environmental pressures, neighboring areas are expected to present a greater morphological similarity due to the gene flow between them. This assumption is supported by the dendrogram of the sampled areas, since the core, source and intermediate areas are grouped in the same cluster. In addition, our results evidenced that the NWA and CBA areas had the lowest diversity of those studied which could be due to the dispersion process among the neighboring areas. This hypothesis is supported by a previous study performed in invasive populations of 
 <italic>S. madagascariensis</italic>, which shows that the areas of lower altitudes (such as the source, core, intermediate and NEA) were characterized by populations with a greater dispersal ability
