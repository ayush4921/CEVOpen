<p id="Par9">The PCA (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) showed a cophenetic correlation (0.92) and the contribution of all the analyzed morphological traits, except for inflorescence length, to the differentiation between areas (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Variability of phenotypic traits (78.8%) was explained by the first two principal components (PC1, 55% and PC2, 23.8%).
