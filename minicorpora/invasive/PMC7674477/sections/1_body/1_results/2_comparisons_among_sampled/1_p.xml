<p id="Par8">The dendrogram evidenced three area clusters (1–3), which were determined by phenotypic distances (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Cluster 1 included NWA and CBA, which shared number of heads. Cluster 2 involved only NEA, which had intermediate values between clusters 1 and 3 for all traits. Cluster 3 included the core, intermediate and source areas, characterized by the lowest values for most of the analyzed traits.
