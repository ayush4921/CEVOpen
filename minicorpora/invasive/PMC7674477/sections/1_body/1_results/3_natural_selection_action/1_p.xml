<p id="Par10">The frequency histogram of each range shows the action of the different types of natural selection. In the established range, during the first three decades, the populations were subjected to disruptive selection, which ultimately tended to increase leaf area and length of internodes and inflorescences (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a–c), unlike number of heads, which tended to decrease (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d).
