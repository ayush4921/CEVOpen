0: The studies about the rapid evolutionary changes in non-native species are of great interest because they may prove if post-introduction success is due to a genetically based change 21  23.
1: Indeed, identifying the phenotypic traits that might evolve to favor dispersal is an interesting topic 24.
2: The aim of our study was to explore the evolutionary forces that have acted to shape the invasive populations of  Senecio madagascariensis in Argentina.
3: We quantified life history traits in individuals obtained during field collections as well as in herbarium specimens, spanning 54 years (from the first record to the present).
4: In addition, we analyzed how natural selection may have acted during the invasions process.
5: Since  S. madagascariensis has a wide distribution range, we hypothesize that natural selection may have favored individuals that invested more energy in rapid growth, increasing size and reproduction (Fig.
6: 1).
