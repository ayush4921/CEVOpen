0: Natural selection is recognized by Darwinism as the main mechanism driving evolutionary changes, and can take three forms, depending on the favored trait: (1) directional selection, which favors one of the extreme phenotypes; (2) stabilizing selection, which favors phenotypes with mean values; and (3) disruptive selection, which favors both phenotype extremes 10.
1: However, Darwin also gives importance to what is currently known as genetic drift and gene flow as forces that can counteract natural selection 11.
2: This phenomenon tends to adapt a population to local conditions (deme), but immigrants from other populations will introduce genes adapted to different conditions, which tends to homogenize allelic frequencies.
3: In the absence of gene flow, divergent selection could favor traits that provide advantageous results in patterns of local adaptation 9,  12.
4: The evolution of locally adapted genotypes requires consistent geographical variation in selective regimes that cause directional trait changes, as well as limited gene flow 13.
5: In contrast, genetic exchange and genetic diversity could contribute to the presence of individuals with genotypes associated with a higher Darwinian fitness 14.
