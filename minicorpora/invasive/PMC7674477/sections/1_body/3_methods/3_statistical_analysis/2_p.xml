<p id="Par22">Additionally, to determine the form of natural selection acting in the sampled areas (edge vs. non-edge), we performed frequency histograms for all the analyzed traits. Histograms were constructed considering four time windows of approximately 10Â years each. Using this methodology, we considered the population introduced during the first time period as the population previous to natural selection in the new habitat, both in edge and non-edge ranges. Therefore, the deviations from the average values of the frequencies would determine the form of selection involved: stabilizing, directional or disruptive.</p>
