0: We performed a clustering analysis using Euclidean distances to assess the relationship among the studied populations and areas.
1: In addition, we analyzed the morphological traits to establish the presence of significant differences through an analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a Tukeys test ( p < 0.05).
2: Finally, in order to define which morphological traits are responsible for population structuring, we performed a principal component analysis (PCA).
3: The clustering analysis and PCA were performed using the INFOSTAT statistical software 32 and the Tukeys test was performed using R studio software 33.
