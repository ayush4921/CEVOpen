0: Additionally, to determine the form of natural selection acting in the sampled areas (edge vs. non-edge), we performed frequency histograms for all the analyzed traits.
1: Histograms were constructed considering four time windows of approximately 10 years each.
2: Using this methodology, we considered the population introduced during the first time period as the population previous to natural selection in the new habitat, both in edge and non-edge ranges.
3: Therefore, the deviations from the average values of the frequencies would determine the form of selection involved: stabilizing, directional or disruptive.
