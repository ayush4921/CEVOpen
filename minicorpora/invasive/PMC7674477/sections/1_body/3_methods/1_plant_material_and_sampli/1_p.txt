0: We analyzed traits of 49 specimens collected in specific field trips and 50 specimens from vouchers of several herbaria (BA, CORD, CTES, LIL, LP, SF, SI) of  Senecio madagascariensis; specimens span 54 years of collection efforts.
1: The individuals are grouped in 42 populations distributed across the invasive range in Argentina (Fig.
2: 1).
3: In order to ensure independence among populations, we considered a group of individuals separated by at least 10 km between them as a population.
4: The sampled areas follow the delimitations previously proposed for this invasive species in Argentina 20.
5: The areas located in the range edge were: NEA (Northeast of Argentina), NWA (Northwest of Argentina) and Cordoba province (CBA), whereas the remaining areas were located in the established range (intermediate, core and source).
