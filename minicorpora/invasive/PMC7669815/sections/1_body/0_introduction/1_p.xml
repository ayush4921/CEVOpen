 <sup>2</sup>; the population density is 48.6 per km
 <sup>2</sup>. The position of the Middle Volga Region, situated in the intersection of large transport routes of both latitudinal and longitudinal directions, and the significant population density are determining factors for the richness of alien flora and the high rates of its dynamics (
