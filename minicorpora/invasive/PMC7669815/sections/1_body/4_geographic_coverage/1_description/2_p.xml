<p>The climatic conditions of the Middle Volga Region are formed under the influence of the drifting western Atlantic Ocean air masses and the Siberian anticyclone macrocirculations. The climate is temperate-continental, with peculiar seasonal circulation, characterised by sharp temperature contrasts between cold and warm seasons, a rapid transition from cold winter to hot summer, moisture deficiency, high evaporation rate and abundance of sunlight. The continentality of the climate increases from west to east. The average January temperature is -11 – -13.5°С, in July – +19°С – +21.0°С. The frost-free period lasts 118–157 days. On the territory of the Region, there is a zonal decrease in annual precipitation from north to south from 540 to 370 mm. The largest part of the area of study is located in the forest-steppe zone, characterised by the presence of typical chernozem soil, an alternation of broad-leaved forests and a rich variety of steppe grasslands. The extreme south point of the territory is occupied by a steppe zone with forb-fescue-feather grass steppes on ordinary and southern chernozem soils.</p>
