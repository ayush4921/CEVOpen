<p>The presented dataset contains information on the occurrences of alien plants since 1851, with the most recent findings recorded in 2019. Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6128950">3</xref> shows that, in the 19th century and in early 20th century, the number of findings of alien plant species in that period was small. The number of occurrences increases by the end of the 20th century, with the largest number of records registered between 2000 and 2019. This result is connected with the growing interest in the study of alien plant species and the active work conducted by the staff of the Institute of Ecology of the Volga Basin of the Russian Academy of Sciences, in particular S.V. Saksonov, N.S. Rakov, S.A. Senator, V.M. Vasyukov etc.
