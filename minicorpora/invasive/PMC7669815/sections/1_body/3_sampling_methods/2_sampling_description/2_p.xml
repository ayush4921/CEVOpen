<p>There are 1472 occurrences in the dataset with coordinate uncertainty of 100 km. This is due to the fact that, in the literary sources of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, there is no exact geolocation. Instead, it is specified, for example, "Western part of Buguruslansky Uyezd" or "neighbourhood of Sergievsk". This collection could be made within a radius of 100 km or more from a settlement. At the same time, such data are of interest from the point of view of identifying the dynamics of the appearance of alien species in the study area.</p>
