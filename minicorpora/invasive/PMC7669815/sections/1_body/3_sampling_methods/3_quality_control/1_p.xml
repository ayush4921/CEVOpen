<p>During the development process of the dataset, the records obtained from primary sources were examined by the first author, as some names of the species did not correspond to the modern nomenclature. The herbarium samples were collected and identified by scientists from the Institute of Ecology of the Volga River Basin of the Russian Academy of Sciences and are stored in the PVB herbarium. The accuracy of the determination of some samples was confirmed by taxonomists from the Lomonosov Moscow State University (MW) and V.L. Komarov Botanical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences (LE). For the purposes of publishing the dataset in the GBIF network, the records have been adjusted to match the Darwin Core specifications (
