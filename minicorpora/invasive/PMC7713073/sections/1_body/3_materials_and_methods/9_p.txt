0: After careful checking whether all the assumptions of the tests used were satisfied, we used a single factor ANOVA and a subsequent Tukey HSD test (if ANOVA indicated presence of significant differences) were used to test for differences between aphid colony duration using the three datasets.
1: We performed these analyses not only for data on the duration of aphid colonies, but also for the aphid population growth rate,  r, and the parameter  a in Eq.
2: ( 1).
3: This was because we were interested in whether the differences between these values (if present) may have affected colony duration: e.g., difference in  r might have speeded up the growth of aphid numbers in the colony, which in turn might have affected colony duration.
