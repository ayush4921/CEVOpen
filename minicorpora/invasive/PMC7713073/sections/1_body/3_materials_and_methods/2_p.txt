2: 4, where 10-year averages ( SDs) of monthly temperatures are plotted for Eleftheroupoli in Greece, which is close to Nea Peramos (as a representative of the Mediterranean climate see, e.g.,  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_climate), and for Ceske Budejovice, which is one of the Czech sites.
3: The average monthly temperatures for the other Czech site, Plzen are almost exactly the same as those for Ceske Budejovice and therefore are not presented here.
