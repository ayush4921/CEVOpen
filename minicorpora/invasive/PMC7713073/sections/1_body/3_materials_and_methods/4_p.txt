0: In order to measure colony duration only those colonies were monitored that were in a very early stage in their development (this means that only up to ten aphids were present on a plant and there were no remnants of dead aphids).
1: For all the colonies monitored, their GPS coordinates were recorded and a colour label with a specific code was attached to the plant.
2: These coordinates only served to distinguish individual colonies and are not reported here.
3: From the length of the transects it follows that the colonies were very close to each other and their position in space is clear from the position of the city.
