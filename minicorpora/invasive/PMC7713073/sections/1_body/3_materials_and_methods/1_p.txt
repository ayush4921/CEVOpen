0: The data for the Mediterranean area were collected in north-eastern Greece around the village Nea Peramos, which is situated on the coast (Fig.
1: 5).
2: We spent a total of five months there during 2017 and 2018, from April to mid-June each year, which is when the aphid colonies there are present.
3: The data for the Czech Republic was collected at two places, around Kysice village near Plzen and in the surroundings of Ceske Budejovice in 2019, from the end of April to the beginning of August (Fig.
4: 6).
5: The two different datasets for the Czech Republic were pooled prior to the analyses, because t-test revealed that there is no significant difference between colony durations at these two sites (t =  1.355, P = 0.18) and it resulted in a larger and compact dataset for the Czech Republic.
