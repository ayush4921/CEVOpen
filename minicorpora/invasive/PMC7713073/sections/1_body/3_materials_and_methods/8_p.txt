0: To get an estimate of the beginning of colony development, we extrapolated the number of aphids backwards in time using an exponential function, the exponent of which was fitted based on the subsequent dynamics, until we reached a predicted colony size 1.
1: As all the colonies monitored were chosen based on being very close to the beginning of their development when first recorded, this backward extrapolation was quite a precise method of estimating the actual beginning of the development of a colony.
