0: For estimating these parameters, the Euler method 29 was used.
1: This model gave us an unbiased estimate of the end of the existence of an aphid colony.
2: Of course, we also recorded the real end of the colony, but this date was affected by many random factors.
3: So, we preferred to extrapolate forwards based on the data on the colony population dynamics and on the model predictions.
4: The instant, when the model predicted a colony size equal to 1, was assumed to be the end of the colony.
