<p id="Par13">Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a shows the average values for the instantaneous growth rate of the aphid populations (parameter 
 <italic>r</italic>) on individual species of plants. Single factor ANOVA did not reveal significant differences between the values of 
 <italic>r</italic> (F = 1.49, p &gt; 0.05). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b shows the overall average values of parameter 
 <italic>r</italic> across the whole season in both countries when trees were sampled. Single factor ANOVA did not reveal significant differences between the values of 
 <italic>r</italic> (F = 0.70, p &gt; 0.05). The lowest average population growth rate of aphids was recorded in Greece in 2017 and the highest in the Czech Republic in 2019, but none of the differences between these averages were statistically significant (the ANOVA above). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c shows the overall average values of parameter 
 <italic>r</italic> in both countries when trees were excluded from the analysis. The growth rate of aphid colonies in Greece in 2017 was slightly lower, but the results of the statistical analyses remained the same as in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b (F = 2.22, p &gt; 0.05). In general, the results tend to show no significant difference in the growth rates.
