0: There is a lot of information on the factors limiting the distributions of species in their native areas 1, but much less information on the factors limiting potential changes in distributions of species that are currently spreading outside their present range, especially that of invasive species 6.
1: This information is often quite essential, as it enables the prediction of future spatial distributions and local abundances of invasive species and their potential effect on people and crops.
2: Information on potential spread of a species also helps with the prediction of the effect of climate change on (1) changes in species distributions, (2) likelihood of their extinction associated with these changes and (3) subsequent threat to humans or crops 7.
