0: In mainland Europe, there is considerable latitudinal variation in the abundance of  H. axyridis18, which dominate mainland communities north of 46 N, while it is rare in those that are south of 42 N. Also, according to unpublished preliminary data 14,  18,  H. axyridis is almost absent in the Mediterranean area.
1: The question therefore arises, why the spread of  H. axyridis towards the equator is limited and whether or not this is a general phenomenon that also holds for other species.
2: Is it because of climatic factors, or the large distance of the Mediterranean from the initial release point in the Netherlands, or is it something else?
