0: Therefore, we hypothesized that the reason might be due to biotic factors.
1: Here we focus on the most likely: diet and life histories.
2: We hypothesized that the limiting factor can be the duration of colonies of prey (i.e., number in one patch, usually on one plant) that may shorten as one approaches the equator.
3: It is well known that there exists a sharp change from mild Central European climate with long vegetative season to harsh Mediterranean conditions with a short vegetative season, which is reflected in the composition of animal communities 20,  21, one result of which may be shortening of the duration of aphid colonies.
4: As indicated by mathematical models of ladybirdaphid systems, short duration of the prey (aphid) colony may lead to a lower fitness and subsequently low population densities of the predator 22  25.
5: Thus, abundance of this predator is most likely to be positively correlated with the duration of the prey colonies necessary for the completion of its larval development.
