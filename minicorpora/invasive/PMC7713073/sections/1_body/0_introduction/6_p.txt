0: Both SDM and CLIMEX models, based on climatic data, predict that the Mediterranean region is suitable for  H. axyridis and therefore one would expect it to be abundant there 3,  4, so it does not seem to be climate that limits the abundance of  H. axyridis in warmer regions.
1: This idea is further supported by the studies made in South America.
2: Grez et al.
3: 19 report a rapid spread of  H. axyridis south and a slow spread north of 33 S, where it was initially introduced near Santiago de Chile.
4: Again, the models of spread of  H. axyridis based on climatic data 5 predict exactly the opposite.
5: Thus, assuming that the SDMs predictions are correct, it is unlikely that the factor that limits the geographic distribution of this species towards the equator can be climate.
6: Neither is the rarity of  H. axyridis in the Mediterranean area likely to be due to a slow rate of its southward dispersal from a distant source area in Western Europe, as its observed rate of spread in a westeast direction is more than 300 km/year 15.
