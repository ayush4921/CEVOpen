0: Ladybirds are an ideal model group for testing the limiting effects of various factors on changes in the distributions of invasive species.
1: This is because: (1) coccinellid biology is well studied, as they are potentially good biological control agents 8  13, (2) they are conspicuous and mostly highly abundant and (3) invasive species are frequently reported in this group 14 either as a consequence of intentional (ladybirds have been successfully introduced to new geographic regions since the early 1900s) or unintentional introductions 14.
