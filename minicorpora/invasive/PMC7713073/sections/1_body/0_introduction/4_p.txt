0: We use the invasive ladybird,  Harmonia axyridis (Pallas), as a model species, mainly because its spread in North America and most of Europe is a matter of serious concern 15.
1: The original area of its distribution is east Palaearctic (Japan, Korea, China, southern Siberia).
2: The early attempts to introduce this species, a voracious predator of aphids and some other insect pests, from its native area into areas with a climate suitable for its survival, were not successful 16.
3: Later this species was mass-produced and used as an efficient means of biological control in glasshouses, mostly against aphids.
4: Some of these domesticated populations escaped from glasshouses and spread into the surrounding environment, first in North America 17.
5: Later,  H. axyridis started to spread into areas with mild-climates around the world: first in Europe after escaping from glasshouses in the Netherlands, then in South America and also in tropical areas 15.
