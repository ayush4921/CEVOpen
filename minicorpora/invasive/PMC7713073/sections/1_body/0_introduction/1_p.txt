0: A species distribution is determined by three main factors: (1) original location, where the species evolved, (2) population ability to spread outside the original location and (3) ecological and environmental factors limiting its spread 1.
1: Of the ecological and environmental factors, climate, particularly temperature, is often assumed to limit the occurrence of a species in a particular region.
2: Several models predicting the distributions of species using meteorological data (CLIMEX 2,  3, SDM models 4) are used to predict the survival probability of a species outside its native distribution 2 or the extent of the area that may be potentially occupied by a species 4,  5.
