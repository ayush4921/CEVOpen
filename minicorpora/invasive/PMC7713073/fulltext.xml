However, this information is often quite essential, as it enables the prediction of future spatial distributions and local abundances of invasive species and the potential effect they may have on people and crops. Arising from glasshouse escapes in North America and the Netherlands, the invasive ladybird, <italic>Harmonia axyridis</italic> (Pallas) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), originally from the east Palearctic, has now spread across the whole of North America and most of Europe, both of which caused serious concern. Recent observations show that the spread of <italic>H. axyridis</italic> towards the equator is limited. For example, it is quite rare in the Mediterranean area and its northward spread in South America is also quite slow, as if there was something limiting its spread towards the equator. European literature indicates it is neither climate, nor the distance of the Mediterranean from the original release location in the Netherlands. Therefore, we hypothesized that it may be biotic factors. In particular, the duration of colonies of prey (colony is the set of individuals in one patch, usually on one plant) that becomes shorter as one approaches the equator. This may lower the fitness of the predator and subsequently lead to low population densities. We test here, whether the duration of aphid colonies is shorter in the Mediterranean area than in Central Europe. Unfortunately, our data does not support this hypothesis. Therefore, the question of what limits the distribution of <italic>H. axyridis</italic> towards the equator remains to be resolved.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Ecology</kwd><kwd>Zoology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001824</institution-id><institution>Grantov&#x000e1; Agentura &#x0010c;esk&#x000e9; Republiky</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17-06763S</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kindlmann</surname><given-names>Pavel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">A species&#x02019; distribution is determined by three main factors: (1) original location, where the species evolved, (2) population ability to spread outside the original location and (3) ecological and environmental factors limiting its spread<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Of the ecological and environmental factors, climate, particularly temperature, is often assumed to limit the occurrence of a species in a particular region. Several models predicting the distributions of species using meteorological data (CLIMEX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, SDM models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>) are used to predict the survival probability of a species outside its native distribution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> or the extent of the area that may be potentially occupied by a species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">There is a lot of information on the factors limiting the distributions of species in their native areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, but much less information on the factors limiting potential changes in distributions of species that are currently spreading outside their present range, especially that of invasive species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. This information is often quite essential, as it enables the prediction of future spatial distributions and local abundances of invasive species and their potential effect on people and crops. Information on potential spread of a species also helps with the prediction of the effect of climate change on (1) changes in species distributions, (2) likelihood of their extinction associated with these changes and (3) subsequent threat to humans or crops<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Ladybirds are an ideal model group for testing the limiting effects of various factors on changes in the distributions of invasive species. This is because: (1) coccinellid biology is well studied, as they are potentially good biological control agents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, (2) they are conspicuous and mostly highly abundant and (3) invasive species are frequently reported in this group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> either as a consequence of intentional (ladybirds have been successfully introduced to new geographic regions since the early 1900s) or unintentional introductions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">We use the invasive ladybird, <italic>Harmonia axyridis</italic> (Pallas), as a model species, mainly because its spread in North America and most of Europe is a matter of serious concern<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The original area of its distribution is east Palaearctic (Japan, Korea, China, southern Siberia). The early attempts to introduce this species, a voracious predator of aphids and some other insect pests, from its native area into areas with a climate suitable for its survival, were not successful<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Later this species was mass-produced and used as an efficient means of biological control in glasshouses, mostly against aphids. Some of these domesticated populations escaped from glasshouses and spread into the surrounding environment, first in North America<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Later, <italic>H. axyridis</italic> started to spread into areas with mild-climates around the world: first in Europe after escaping from glasshouses in the Netherlands, then in South America and also in tropical areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">In mainland Europe, there is considerable latitudinal variation in the abundance of <italic>H. axyridis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, which dominate mainland communities&#x02019; north of 46&#x000b0; N, while it is rare in those that are south of 42&#x000b0; N. Also, according to unpublished preliminary data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, <italic>H. axyridis</italic> is almost absent in the Mediterranean area. The question therefore arises, why the spread of <italic>H. axyridis</italic> towards the equator is limited and whether or not this is a general phenomenon that also holds for other species. Is it because of climatic factors, or the large distance of the Mediterranean from the initial release point in the Netherlands, or is it something else?</p><p id="Par7">Both SDM and CLIMEX models, based on climatic data, predict that the Mediterranean region is suitable for <italic>H. axyridis</italic> and therefore one would expect it to be abundant there<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, so it does not seem to be climate that limits the abundance of <italic>H. axyridis</italic> in warmer regions. This idea is further supported by the studies made in South America. Grez et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> report a rapid spread of <italic>H. axyridis</italic> south and a slow spread north of 33&#x000b0; S, where it was initially introduced near Santiago de Chile. Again, the models of spread of <italic>H. axyridis</italic> based on climatic data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> predict exactly the opposite. Thus, assuming that the SDMs&#x02019; predictions are correct, it is unlikely that the factor that limits the geographic distribution of this species towards the equator can be climate. Neither is the rarity of <italic>H. axyridis</italic> in the Mediterranean area likely to be due to a slow rate of its southward dispersal from a distant source area in Western Europe, as its observed rate of spread in a west&#x02013;east direction is more than 300&#x000a0;km/year<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">Therefore, we hypothesized that the reason might be due to biotic factors. Here we focus on the most likely: diet and life histories. We hypothesized that the limiting factor can be the duration of colonies of prey (i.e., number in one patch, usually on one plant) that may shorten as one approaches the equator. It is well known that there exists a sharp change from mild Central European climate with long vegetative season to harsh Mediterranean conditions with a short vegetative season, which is reflected in the composition of animal communities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, one result of which may be shortening of the duration of aphid colonies. As indicated by mathematical models of ladybird&#x02014;aphid systems, short duration of the prey (aphid) colony may lead to a lower fitness and subsequently low population densities of the predator<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Thus, abundance of this predator is most likely to be positively correlated with the duration of the prey colonies necessary for the completion of its larval development.</p><p id="Par9">To summarize: we test whether the duration of aphid colonies is shorter in the Mediterranean area than in Central Europe and whether this limits the abundance of <italic>H. axyridis</italic> in the Mediterranean area.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><p id="Par10">The species of aphids monitored in the field, when possible, were determined along with their host plants.

However, if the data were collected in different years, then it is not possible to determine whether the observed shorter colony duration in the Mediterranean was caused by different sites (Mediterranean vs. temperate region), or by different years of monitoring and further years of monitoring are required, before the claim that H0 is supported by the data is substantiated.

Then again there are two options:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par26"><italic>There is no effect of year.</italic> In such a case, we should <italic>reject H0</italic>. In our data, the non-significant effect of year in the Greek data <italic>supports</italic>, but does not <italic>prove</italic> no effect of year.

Longer colony duration in the Mediterranean (although based on data from different years) is an unexpected result, based on a large amount of data. So our data <italic>do not support the idea that shorter colony duration is the reason for the paucity of Harmonia in the Mediterranean</italic>, as colony duration was not <italic>shorter</italic> there.</p><p>One could also criticize the low number of replicates in terms of sites and years. In terms of effort, one or two people spent 10&#x000a0;months of uninterrupted day-to-day monitoring in the field (five in each country). The results are statistically significant and indicate the opposite to what was expected. Of course, it would be better to have had three sites in each country and monitored each of the colonies at each site for 3&#x000a0;years. This would require not 10, but 23&#x000a0;months of interrupted day-to-day monitoring by 1&#x02013;2 people. In the future, funding may become available to do this, but meantime, accepting the statistically significant results and looking for other possible reasons for the paucity of <italic>H. axyridis</italic> in the Mediterranean would appear to be the better strategy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Materials and methods</title><p id="Par30">The data for the Mediterranean area were collected in north-eastern Greece around the village N&#x000e9;a P&#x000e9;ramos, which is situated on the coast (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).

These aphids are also attacked by natural enemies at times when they are actively reproducing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, but as these aphids are present throughout the vegetative season, it is difficult to determine the duration of the period when they are likely to be attacked by natural enemies.</p><p id="Par33">In order to measure colony duration only those colonies were monitored that were in a very early stage in their development (this means that only up to ten aphids were present on a plant and there were no remnants of dead aphids).

In this model, instead of carrying capacity, used in the logistic equation, we used aphid cumulative density (the cumulative number of aphids from the beginning of colony existence) scaled by the parameter <italic>a</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par36">For estimating these parameters, the Euler method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> was used. This model gave us an unbiased estimate of the end of the existence of an aphid colony. Of course, we also recorded the real end of the colony, but this date was affected by many random factors. So, we preferred to extrapolate forwards based on the data on the colony population dynamics and on the model predictions. The instant, when the model predicted a colony size equal to 1, was assumed to be the end of the colony.</p><p id="Par37">To get an estimate of the beginning of colony development, we extrapolated the number of aphids backwards in time using an exponential function, the exponent of which was fitted based on the subsequent dynamics, until we reached a predicted colony size 1. As all the colonies monitored were chosen based on being very close to the beginning of their development when first recorded, this backward extrapolation was quite a precise method of estimating the actual beginning of the development of a colony.</p><p id="Par38">After careful checking whether all the assumptions of the tests used were satisfied, we used a single factor ANOVA and a subsequent Tukey HSD test (if ANOVA indicated presence of significant differences) were used to test for differences between aphid colony duration using the three datasets. We performed these analyses not only for data on the duration of aphid colonies, but also for the aphid population growth rate, <italic>r</italic>, and the parameter <italic>a</italic> in Eq.&#x000a0;(<xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="">1</xref>). This was because we were interested in whether the differences between these values (if present) may have affected colony duration: e.g., difference in <italic>r</italic> might have speeded up the growth of aphid numbers in the colony, which in turn might have affected colony duration.</p><p id="Par39">The monitoring of colonies of only host alternating species of aphids on trees might have biased the result because trees are much larger than herbaceous plants and therefore the duration of the colonies might be longer on trees than on herbaceous plants. Of the haphazardly selected plants, the duration of colonies of aphids on trees were only recorded in Greece in 2017. Therefore, to address this possible bias, the analyses mentioned was carried out twice: once including trees and once without, to determine whether including aphid colonies on trees biased the result.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par40">We hypothesized that aphid colony duration in Greece is shorter as the climate there is warmer. Our empirical data indicate the opposite: duration of aphid colonies in Greece was significantly longer than in the CR. This does not support our hypothesis. Therefore, colony duration does not seem to be the reason for the low numbers of <italic>H. axyridis</italic> in Greece. In the future, there is a need for more extensive studies, including more years, more countries, more species of plants per year and country, to deal with the potential biases in this study. It is a pity that limitations on funding prevented the simultaneous monitoring in both countries in the same years and for more years. In the absence of this constraint, our results might have been more robust. However, even the results presented here indicate that more extensive studies are unlikely to add anything new, as the paucity of <italic>H. axyridis</italic> in the Mediterranean area is most probably due to factors not yet considered.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This project was supported by the Grant no. 17-06763S of the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic.
