<p id="Par4">There are many types of models that can be used to evaluate ecological change. Spatially explicit models include, among others, invasive species spread models, individual based models, network models, or potential distribution models. There are also aspatial models such as vegetation dynamics models used to quantify vegetation class amounts within a landscape. Area- or state- based models that inform how the condition or composition of a piece of land may change over time can provide key information to managers who are concerned with the future condition of a landscape.</p>
