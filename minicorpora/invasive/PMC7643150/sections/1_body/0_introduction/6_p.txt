0: Experts on the buffelgrass invasion in southern Arizona have identified vegetation conversion, fire, and the loss of biodiversity and native species, especially the loss of saguaro cacti ( Carnegiea gigantea (Engelm.)
1: Britton & Rose), as the primary threats caused by the buffelgrass invasion in the Sonoran Desert 29.
2: The introduction of buffelgrass to the Sonoran Desert, which includes many non-fire adapted species, leaves managers with a high degree of uncertainty about the trajectory of the invasion and associated landscape changes because no analog ecological conditions exist that would allow them to make more than broad, general predictions 30.
3: There is a critical need to understand the nature of the threat posed to native ecosystems by this invasive species to effectively allocate control efforts and ensure long-term land management goals are met.
4: Misjudging the dynamics of the situation may waste scarce resources and allow priority resources or locations to be adversely and irreversibly impacted.
