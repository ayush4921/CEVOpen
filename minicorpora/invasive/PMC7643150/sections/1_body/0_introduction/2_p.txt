0: Invasive species, like native species, can be influenced by many interacting abiotic and biotic factors.
1: These factors, including climate, can influence rates of spread across a landscape and patch infilling in established locations, adding variability to invasion dynamics (e.g., 6).
2: A patch can be defined as the perimeter of an infested area, and infilling is the increase in cover within that defined patch.
3: Spread occurs when patch perimeters expand or when new satellite patches establish.
4: Spread and infill, particularly in the arid southwestern United States, may be tied to fluctuating resources such as interannual variation in precipitation 7.
5: Patch infilling is likely tied to the number of seeds produced by a patch and seedling germination and survival, which can be influenced by climate 8.
