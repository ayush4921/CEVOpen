 </sup>. Previous simulation modeling to evaluate the buffelgrass problem in Saguaro National Park did not include an evaluation of the sensitivity of the simulations to model initialization or to uncertainties in model parameterization, limiting the ability of simulations to capture the range of potential future landscape conditions
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>
 </sup>. Model initialization describes landscape starting conditions, including landscape susceptibility to buffelgrass invasions and where and how much buffelgrass is on the landscape. Uncertainties in model parameterization include uncertainty in patch infill rates and uncertainty in how these rates may vary with precipitation
