0: Buffelgrass growth and vigor in desert ecosystems can be influenced by the amount of precipitation during a growing season 31,  32, and the effect of variable precipitation on buffelgrass infill rates is a primary uncertainty identified by local experts 29.
1: The southwest region has exhibited wide annual variation in monsoon season precipitation 33, with the late 1970s and 1980s being relatively wet compared to past and current decades 34.
2: Previous simulation modeling to evaluate the buffelgrass problem in Saguaro National Park did not include an evaluation of the sensitivity of the simulations to model initialization or to uncertainties in model parameterization, limiting the ability of simulations to capture the range of potential future landscape conditions 29.
3: Model initialization describes landscape starting conditions, including landscape susceptibility to buffelgrass invasions and where and how much buffelgrass is on the landscape.
4: Uncertainties in model parameterization include uncertainty in patch infill rates and uncertainty in how these rates may vary with precipitation 29.
