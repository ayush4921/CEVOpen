0: Invasive species are non-native species that cause harm to, or negatively impact, the system to which they are introduced.
1: These impacts can vary widely, and the impacts are generally positively related to the abundance of the invasive species 1.
2: Impacts can occur at different scales within an ecosystem, including impacts to individual organisms, population genetics, population dynamics, communities, and ecosystem processes 2.
3: Effects on ecosystem properties can include wildfire frequency and extent, such as those found with invasive grass species in the western United States 3.
4: Furthermore, invasive species can respond to and interact with changing environments in ways that shift or modify the magnitude of their impact 4.
5: Forecasts of invasive species impacts are needed to inform both risk assessments and to prioritize management actions 5.
6: Understanding the potential geographic extent of an invasive species across a landscape and associated impacts to native systems can help define the degree of the problem.
