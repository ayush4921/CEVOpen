0: State-and-transition simulation models (STSM) are an increasingly employed area-based simulation tool used to simulate landscape dynamics and evaluate complex and often uncertain future conditions 9 and have been used to forecast plant invasions 10  13.
1: STSMs divide a landscape into discrete spatial units (cells) each assigned a discrete state; simulations track changes in cell state over discrete time steps based on discrete transitions between states that can be probabilistic or time-based and can be unique for each transition type (e.g., succession, wildfire, timber harvest, herbicide spraying).
2: STSMs, and other complex models representing ecosystem processes, require multiple parameters that may be stochastic and uncertain.
3: Uncertainties in ecological forecasts using STSMs can include ecological process variables and environmental stochasticity (e.g.
4: 14).
5: One utility of STSMs for invasive species is identifying research priorities to explore uncertainties that have a strong influence on modeled outcomes, along with helping to identify how big is the problem?
6: and appropriateness of various management strategies 15.
7: Here we investigate the effects of model uncertainties on the simulated spread and infill of invasive buffelgrass ( Cenchrus ciliaris L. syn  Pennisetum ciliare (L.) Link) in Saguaro National Park (SAGU), located within the Sonoran Desert in southern Arizona, USA (Supplementary Figure  S1 online).
