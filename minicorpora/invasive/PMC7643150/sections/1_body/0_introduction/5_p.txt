0: Buffelgrass is an invasive perennial grass native to Africa that has been introduced widely as a forage species and for erosion control 16.
1: Following its introduction, buffelgrass has spread and become invasive in many natural areas globally where it has various impacts on native ecosystems.
2: Various species distribution models exist for buffelgrass, including global and regional models under current and future climate that provide information on its potential distribution 17  19.
3: In the Sonoran Desert, conversion of native vegetation to buffelgrass savanna has altered ecohydrology 20, altered fire regimes 21,  22, and negatively impacted populations of native species 23  25.
4: Altered fire regimes and impacts to native populations have also been observed in Australia 26  28.
