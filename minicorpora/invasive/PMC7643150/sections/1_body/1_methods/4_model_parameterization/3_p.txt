0: The wet-year infill acceleration factor decreases the time to deterministic transitions between cover classes during wet years 29.
1: This effect was elicited as a divisor that would divide the total time needed to be spent within an age class, and thus described the patch infill acceleration factor that would occur if all years were wet.
2: We refer to the elicited lower quantile value as slow, average value as moderate, and upper quantile value as fast.
3: The simulation model tracks the amount of time spent within a state class per cell, typically adding one year to the class age of the cell at each time step.
4: To implement the acceleration factor on a year-by-year basis in the model, we converted the divisor to an additive effect such that the elicited divisors of 2, 3, and 4 (rounded to whole numbers) resulted in transitions occurring 2  , 3  , and 4  as quickly.
5: Translating this to a single year time-step meant that a 2  transition would add 1 additional year to the age of a cell (1 default + 1 acceleration factor = 2 years), a 3  transition would add 2 additional years to the age of a cell (1 default + 2 acceleration factor = 3 years), and a 4  transition would add 3 additional years to the age of a cell (1 default + 3 acceleration factor = 4 years).
6: Generalizing this pattern, a wet-year divisor of n is implemented within a timestep by adding the default 1 year + (n  1) additional years to the cell age during a wet year, thus decreasing the overall time spent within a cover class (Fig.
7: 1b).
