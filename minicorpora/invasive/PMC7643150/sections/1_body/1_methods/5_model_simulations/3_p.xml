<p id="Par20">Due to computational limitations, the timing of ‘wet’ years was not varied for fire simulations across the 20 Monte Carlo realizations, while the timing of no-fire simulations was varied across iterations as described above. To investigate the impact of constant versus variable timing of ‘wet’ years on model outcomes, we also ran the no-fire simulations with the same constant ‘wet’ years across iterations as those used for the fire simulations (Supplementary Figure
