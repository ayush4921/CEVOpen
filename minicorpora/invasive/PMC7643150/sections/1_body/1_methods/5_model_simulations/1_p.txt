0: We implemented the STSM described above using the stsim base package (version 3.1.21 9) with the stsim-farsite add-on package (version 3.1.21) running on SyncroSim version 2.0.41.
1: The stsim-farsite package integrates the FARSITE fire area simulator software version 4.1.055 36 into ST-Sim.
2: We provided FARSITE with current time step fuel model attributes of each cell in the landscape along with the number of ignitions (one per time step) and weather information (see 37 for details), and FARSITE then produced fire perimeters at each time step.
3: If ignitions occurred in non-burnable areas, the perimeter would be zero for that time step.
