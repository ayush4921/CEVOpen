0: Due to computational limitations, the timing of wet years was not varied for fire simulations across the 20 Monte Carlo realizations, while the timing of no-fire simulations was varied across iterations as described above.
1: To investigate the impact of constant versus variable timing of wet years on model outcomes, we also ran the no-fire simulations with the same constant wet years across iterations as those used for the fire simulations (Supplementary Figure  S2 online).
