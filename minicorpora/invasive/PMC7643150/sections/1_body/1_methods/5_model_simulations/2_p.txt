0: We ran simulations both with and without fire.
1: We ran each simulation for 30-time steps (from 20142044), including 20 Monte Carlo realizations to capture stochasticity in the ecological processes.
2: We considered uncertainties associated with model initialization (initialization scenarios) and uncertainties associated with model parameterization (ecological scenarios).
3: Initialization scenarios included each combination of habitat suitability and initial conditions (nine initialization scenarios).
4: Ecological scenarios included combinations of all three factors affecting cover-class transition rates (infill rate, wet-year probability, and wet-year infill acceleration factor; for a total of 27 ecological scenarios).
5: We were interested in the interaction of these uncertainties with fire on the landscape; however, including FARSITE at each timestep to simulate fire is much more computationally intensive than simulation runs without fire.
6: For this reason, we ran all 27 ecological scenarios without fire, and only ran a subset of ecological scenarios with fire.
7: For fire simulations we ran three combinations of ecological parameter levels: the lower bounds (low infill rate, low wet-year probability, slow infill acceleration factorreferred to as dry-slow patch infill), the middle bounds (moderate infill rate, moderate wet-year probability, moderate wet-year infill acceleration factorreferred to as moderate patch infill), and the upper bounds (high infill rate, high wet year probability, fast wet year infill acceleration factorreferred to as wet-fast patch infill).
