0: We conducted sensitivity analyses on a key uncertainty in model initialization: the total amount of SAGU defined as being susceptible to buffelgrass establishment.
1: Each grid cell of the desert ecosystem was assigned as susceptible or unsusceptible based on a habitat suitability model developed for SAGU 17.
2: The habitat suitability model produces continuous values between 0 and 1, and a threshold value is selected to discretize the predictions into binary suitable or unsuitable classes.
3: To test the sensitivity to the habitat suitability threshold decision, we varied threshold value between 0.45 and 0.55, which resulted in different amounts of grid cells assigned to the susceptible strata.
4: These values increase (0.45) and decrease (0.55) the estimated amount of susceptible area on the landscape by roughly  10% relative to the original index used for simulations (0.50) that was determined based on the habitat suitability model evaluation 17.
5: We refer to the threshold value of 0.45 as high (more susceptible area), 0.50 as moderate, and 0.55 as low (less susceptible area; Table  1).
