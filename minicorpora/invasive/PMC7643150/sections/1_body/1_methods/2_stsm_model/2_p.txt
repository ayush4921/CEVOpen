0: Because we were specifically interested in investigating the impacts of ecological uncertainty on buffelgrass forecasts in SAGU, we used a modified version of the Jarnevich et al.
1: 29 STSM that eliminated management-induced ecological transitions between state classes, retaining all ecological transitions including seed dispersal, buffelgrass cover increases, seedbank mortality, and fire-induced ecological transitions (Fig.
2: 1a).
3: Because we excluded management actions, we further modified the original STSM by collapsing the detected and undetected classes that describe whether a cell is known to be invaded or not into states distinguished only by cover class (e.g., detected < 1% cover and undetected < 1% cover both became  < 1% cover).
