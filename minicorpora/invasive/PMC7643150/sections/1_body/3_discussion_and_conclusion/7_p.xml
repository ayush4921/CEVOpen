 </sup> such as the converted state in our simulations. Regardless of uncertainties, all scenarios had increasing buffelgrass cover at the end of the simulation, indicating that buffelgrass may invade a larger portion of the study area than that predicted in the final time step of the simulations. These commonalities across scenarios without management activities allow assessment of the potential scale of the buffelgrass problem in Saguaro National Park, addressing a second question that STSMs can be useful for in invasion contexts

 </sup>. We found that scenarios spanning ranges of uncertainty related to buffelgrass infill rates all predicted increasing buffelgrass cover in the absence of management actions over a 30-year time horizon. Further, these parameters were more influential to model outcomes than initial conditions, and variation in the base infill rates had the greatest influence on the amount of buffelgrass on the landscape and the size and frequency of fires. Given the substantial differences in the predicted amount of buffelgrass on the landscape at the end of our simulations and the size and frequency of fires for dry-slow scenarios compared to wet-fast scenarios, additional research on the base infill rates of buffelgrass could greatly reduce uncertainty in model simulations and improve model performance. Our approach could be widely applied to buffelgrass in other locations where it is invading and where it could potentially impact fire cycles; answers to the research questions we have listed would inform these efforts. The approach could be used for other species as well, to help inform the widespread issue of invasive grasses and their impacts to the fire cycle.
