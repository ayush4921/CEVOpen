<p id="Par31">STSMs can be useful in identifying key uncertainties that may influence invasion forecasts. Future research on influential parameters could better inform decision making by providing more reliable predictions of the potential spread, infill, and impacts of invasive plants

 </sup>. Many STSMs incorporate uncertainty into models by providing a distribution of values for uncertain parameters that the model can draw from across Monte Carlo realizations (e.g.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>
 </sup>). By running many Monte Carlo realizations, uncertainty around state class distribution and transition amounts at the end of the simulation is provided. We chose instead to run multiple Monte Carlo realizations of scenarios with different combinations of these uncertain values to answer the question of which parameter values have the greatest influence on invaded area and cover-class distribution to allow statistical evaluation of the influence of the different parameters. Thus, we have provided information about which ecological parameter uncertainties are important to target with research to thereby better inform management decisions.
