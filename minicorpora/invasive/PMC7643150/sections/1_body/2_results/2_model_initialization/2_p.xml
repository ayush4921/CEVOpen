<p id="Par25">For the ‘no-fire, variable wet years’ scenario group, invaded area at the end of the simulation with low initialization had a mean of 3030 ha (ranging between 2473 ha and 3460 ha) and the simulation with high initialization had a mean of 3472 ha (ranging between 2772 ha and 4003 ha). Hierarchical partitioning identified susceptibility as a more important source of variation in invaded area at the end of the simulation than initial conditions (explaining 93% of the variation compared to 7%); the interaction between susceptibility and initial conditions was not significant and contributed minimally (Supplementary 1 Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref> online). For the ‘no-fire, constant wet years’ scenario group, the boxplots exhibit minimal variation, indicating that most of the stochasticity in the no-fire simulations arose from wet-year timing. These boxplots did not overlap.
