<p id="Par26">Varying precipitation effects and infill rates resulted in large variations in the amount of invaded area at the end of the 30-year simulation (range of 1199 ha to 7134 ha; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Unlike sensitivity to initialization, the variation from simulation parameter values was much greater than the variation among Monte Carlo realizations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, grey area around lines displaying + /− one standard deviation). The infill rate had the greatest influence on area invaded at the end of the simulation according to hierarchical partitioning (78%), followed by wet-year probability (18%), with minimal influence from the wet-year infill acceleration factor (4%). The interaction between infill rate, wet-year probability, wet-year infill acceleration factor, and the three-way interaction were significant but contributed minimally compared to the direct effects (Supplementary 1 Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref> online). Nine of the ten most invaded simulations were from scenarios that included the high infill rate. The scenario with a moderate infill rate but a high wet-year probability and a fast wet-year infill acceleration factor had a higher invaded area than scenarios with high infill rate but low wet-year probability. Infill rate combined with wet-year probability was more important than the wet-year infill acceleration factor, with all three wet-year infill acceleration factors generally clumped slow to fast within the wet-year probability and infill rate groupings.
