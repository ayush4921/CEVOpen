 <caption> Area invaded by buffelgrass through time in Saguaro National Park, where area invaded is calculated by multiplying the area in each cover-class bin by the average cover within each bin, for 27 ecological scenarios combining uncertainty in the infill rates, the wet-year probability, and the wet-year infill acceleration factor. Grey area around lines display + /− one standard deviation. </caption>
