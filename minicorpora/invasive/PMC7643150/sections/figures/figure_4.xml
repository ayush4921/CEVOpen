  <p>Area of landscape cells assigned to each buffelgrass cover class in Saguaro National Park at the start (2014) and end (2044) for three scenario groups. The scenario groups include simulations without fire run with both varying timing of wet years and constant timing of wet year, and simulations with fire run with constant timing of wet years. Facets show scenario results for the combination of three sets of ecological parameter values (dry-slow patch infill, moderate patch infill, and wet-fast patch infill) and three sets of initialization conditions. The dashed black line in each facet indicates the amount of desert ecosystem susceptible to buffelgrass invasion for that set of simulations.</p>
