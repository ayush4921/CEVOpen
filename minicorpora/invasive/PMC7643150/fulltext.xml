Such forecasts are hampered by ecological uncertainties associated with non-analog conditions resulting from the introduction of an invader to an ecosystem. We developed a state-and-transition simulation model tied to a fire behavior model to simulate the spread of buffelgrass (<italic>Cenchrus ciliaris</italic>) in Saguaro National Park, AZ, USA over a 30-year period. The simulation models forecast the potential extent and impact of a buffelgrass invasion including size and frequency of fire events and displacement of saguaro cacti and other native species. Using simulation models allowed us to evaluate how model uncertainties affected forecasted landscape outcomes. We compared scenarios covering a range of parameter uncertainties including model initialization (landscape susceptibility to invasion) and expert-identified ecological uncertainties (buffelgrass patch infill rates and precipitation). Our simulations showed substantial differences in the amount of buffelgrass on the landscape and the size and frequency of fires for dry years with slow patch infill scenarios compared to wet years with fast patch infill scenarios. We identified uncertainty in buffelgrass patch infill rates as a key area for research to improve forecasts. Our approach could be used to investigate novel processes in other invaded systems.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Invasive species</kwd><kwd>Ecological modelling</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>U.S. Geological Survey</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Invasive species are non-native species that cause harm to, or negatively impact, the system to which they are introduced. These impacts can vary widely, and the impacts are generally positively related to the abundance of the invasive species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Impacts can occur at different scales within an ecosystem, including impacts to individual organisms, population genetics, population dynamics, communities, and ecosystem processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Effects on ecosystem properties can include wildfire frequency and extent, such as those found with invasive grass species in the western United States<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Furthermore, invasive species can respond to and interact with changing environments in ways that shift or modify the magnitude of their impact<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Forecasts of invasive species&#x02019; impacts are needed to inform both risk assessments and to prioritize management actions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Understanding the potential geographic extent of an invasive species across a landscape and associated impacts to native systems can help define the degree of the problem.</p><p id="Par3">Invasive species, like native species, can be influenced by many interacting abiotic and biotic factors. These factors, including climate, can influence rates of spread across a landscape and patch infilling in established locations, adding variability to invasion dynamics (e.g.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>). A patch can be defined as the perimeter of an infested area, and infilling is the increase in cover within that defined patch. Spread occurs when patch perimeters expand or when new satellite patches establish. Spread and infill, particularly in the arid southwestern United States, may be tied to fluctuating resources such as interannual variation in precipitation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Patch infilling is likely tied to the number of seeds produced by a patch and seedling germination and survival, which can be influenced by climate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">There are many types of models that can be used to evaluate ecological change. Spatially explicit models include, among others, invasive species spread models, individual based models, network models, or potential distribution models. There are also aspatial models such as vegetation dynamics models used to quantify vegetation class amounts within a landscape. Area- or state- based models that inform how the condition or composition of a piece of land may change over time can provide key information to managers who are concerned with the future condition of a landscape.</p><p id="Par5">State-and-transition simulation models (STSM) are an increasingly employed area-based simulation tool used to simulate landscape dynamics and evaluate complex and often uncertain future conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and have been used to forecast plant invasions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. STSMs divide a landscape into discrete spatial units (cells) each assigned a discrete state; simulations track changes in cell state over discrete time steps based on discrete transitions between states that can be probabilistic or time-based and can be unique for each transition type (e.g., succession, wildfire, timber harvest, herbicide spraying). STSMs, and other complex models representing ecosystem processes, require multiple parameters that may be stochastic and uncertain. Uncertainties in ecological forecasts using STSMs can include ecological process variables and environmental stochasticity (e.g.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>). One utility of STSMs for invasive species is identifying research priorities to explore uncertainties that have a strong influence on modeled outcomes, along with helping to identify &#x02018;how big is the problem?&#x02019; and appropriateness of various management strategies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Here we investigate the effects of model uncertainties on the simulated spread and infill of invasive buffelgrass (<italic>Cenchrus ciliaris</italic> L. syn <italic>Pennisetum ciliare</italic> (L.) Link) in Saguaro National Park (SAGU), located within the Sonoran Desert in southern Arizona, USA (Supplementary Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref> online).</p><p id="Par6">Buffelgrass is an invasive perennial grass native to Africa that has been introduced widely as a forage species and for erosion control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Following its introduction, buffelgrass has spread and become invasive in many natural areas globally where it has various impacts on native ecosystems. Various species distribution models exist for buffelgrass, including global and regional models under current and future climate that provide information on its potential distribution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. In the Sonoran Desert, conversion of native vegetation to buffelgrass savanna has altered ecohydrology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, altered fire regimes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, and negatively impacted populations of native species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Altered fire regimes and impacts to native populations have also been observed in Australia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">Experts on the buffelgrass invasion in southern Arizona have identified vegetation conversion, fire, and the loss of biodiversity and native species, especially the loss of saguaro cacti (<italic>Carnegiea gigantea</italic> (Engelm.) Britton &#x00026; Rose), as the primary threats caused by the buffelgrass invasion in the Sonoran Desert<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. The introduction of buffelgrass to the Sonoran Desert, which includes many non-fire adapted species, leaves managers with a high degree of uncertainty about the trajectory of the invasion and associated landscape changes because no analog ecological conditions exist that would allow them to make more than broad, general predictions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. There is a critical need to understand the nature of the threat posed to native ecosystems by this invasive species to effectively allocate control efforts and ensure long-term land management goals are met. Misjudging the dynamics of the situation may waste scarce resources and allow priority resources or locations to be adversely and irreversibly impacted.</p><p id="Par8">Buffelgrass growth and vigor in desert ecosystems can be influenced by the amount of precipitation during a growing season<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, and the effect of variable precipitation on buffelgrass infill rates is a primary uncertainty identified by local experts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. The southwest region has exhibited wide annual variation in monsoon season precipitation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, with the late 1970s and 1980s being relatively wet compared to past and current decades<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Previous simulation modeling to evaluate the buffelgrass problem in Saguaro National Park did not include an evaluation of the sensitivity of the simulations to model initialization or to uncertainties in model parameterization, limiting the ability of simulations to capture the range of potential future landscape conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Model initialization describes landscape starting conditions, including landscape susceptibility to buffelgrass invasions and where and how much buffelgrass is on the landscape. Uncertainties in model parameterization include uncertainty in patch infill rates and uncertainty in how these rates may vary with precipitation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par9">Our objectives were to forecast the potential influence of buffelgrass on the Saguaro National Park landscape, including loss of native desert vegetation and altered fire dynamics given ecological uncertainties, and to identify which uncertainties most influence forecasts and thus may have the largest impact on management decisions. We examined the sensitivity of STSM results to model initialization and to ecological uncertainties across an expert-identified range of possible values<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> along with uncertainty related to stochasticity between individual model runs. We explored the potential impacts from buffelgrass competition alone versus impacts of an altered disturbance regime (i.e., fire). We considered two groups of uncertainties: those associated with underlying landscape characteristics at the start of the simulation (model initialization scenarios) and those associated with model parameterization including infill rates and the influence of precipitation on infill rates (ecological scenarios). The simulations were run in the absence of management actions and highlight the potential range in the magnitude of the invasion if buffelgrass is left untreated&#x02014;an important metric requested by regional experts.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study area</title><p id="Par10">Saguaro National Park (here forth referred to as SAGU), located in the Sonoran Desert in southern Arizona, is divided into two units separated by the city of Tucson (Supplementary Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref> online).

Susceptible locations were defined as locations predicted as suitable for buffelgrass by a habitat suitability model developed for SAGU using their buffelgrass location data and environmental characteristics including winter temperature, slope, northness and eastness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. The desert ecosystem not classified as susceptible was assigned to unsusceptible. The STSM also assigns each grid cell of the landscape to state classes related to buffelgrass cover including uninvaded, seedbank (cells with buffelgrass seeds but no established buffelgrass), buffelgrass cover classes of&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1%, 1&#x02013;10%,&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;10&#x02013;50%, and&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;50%, and a converted state consisting of a buffelgrass savanna as a result of burning. Operationally, each grid cell can be thought of as a patch, and infilling is the increasing cover of buffelgrass within that cell. Landscape state classes also correspond to vegetation fuel load to facilitate use of a fire behavior model.

To determine the probability of a &#x02018;wet&#x02019; year, we examined historic climate variability to calculate the probability of having a year with above median monsoon length and above median cumulative monsoon precipitation.

Translating this to a single year time-step meant that a 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;transition would add 1 additional year to the age of a cell (1 default&#x02009;+&#x02009;1 acceleration factor&#x02009;=&#x02009;2&#x000a0;years), a 3&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;transition would add 2 additional years to the age of a cell (1 default&#x02009;+&#x02009;2 acceleration factor&#x02009;=&#x02009;3&#x000a0;years), and a 4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;transition would add 3 additional years to the age of a cell (1 default&#x02009;+&#x02009;3 acceleration factor&#x02009;=&#x02009;4&#x000a0;years). Generalizing this pattern, a wet-year divisor of n is implemented within a timestep by adding the default 1&#x000a0;year&#x02009;+&#x02009;(n &#x02013; 1) additional years to the cell age during a &#x02018;wet&#x02019; year, thus decreasing the overall time spent within a cover class (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Model simulations</title><p id="Par18">We implemented the STSM described above using the stsim base package (version 3.1.21<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>) with the stsim-farsite add-on package (version 3.1.21) running on SyncroSim version 2.0.41.

We considered uncertainties associated with model initialization (initialization scenarios) and uncertainties associated with model parameterization (ecological scenarios). Initialization scenarios included each combination of habitat suitability and initial conditions (nine initialization scenarios). Ecological scenarios included combinations of all three factors affecting cover-class transition rates (infill rate, wet-year probability, and wet-year infill acceleration factor; for a total of 27 ecological scenarios). We were interested in the interaction of these uncertainties with fire on the landscape; however, including FARSITE at each timestep to simulate fire is much more computationally intensive than simulation runs without fire. For this reason, we ran all 27 ecological scenarios without fire, and only ran a subset of ecological scenarios with fire. For fire simulations we ran three combinations of ecological parameter levels: the lower bounds (low infill rate, low wet-year probability, slow infill acceleration factor&#x02014;referred to as dry-slow patch infill), the middle bounds (moderate infill rate, moderate wet-year probability, moderate wet-year infill acceleration factor&#x02014;referred to as moderate patch infill), and the upper bounds (high infill rate, high wet year probability, fast wet year infill acceleration factor&#x02014;referred to as wet-fast patch infill).</p><p id="Par20">Due to computational limitations, the timing of &#x02018;wet&#x02019; years was not varied for fire simulations across the 20 Monte Carlo realizations, while the timing of no-fire simulations was varied across iterations as described above.

Examining the contribution of components of ecological uncertainty, we found that uncertainty in infill rates had the greatest influence on future landscape conditions, including the amount of buffelgrass on the landscape and the size and frequency of fires; the variation arising from different infill rate values was greater than the variation arising from stochasticity. These results highlight the potential need to better understand the temporal dynamics associated with increases in buffelgrass abundance over knowing the probability of wet years or the effects of wet-year infill acceleration factor.</p><p id="Par33">The rate of buffelgrass infill is difficult to quantify because of the high variability in precipitation in the region.

Buffelgrass can also increase both the scale and frequency of fire thereby affecting non-fire adapted flora and fauna in the desert ecosystem<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Our simulation results reflect the combination of these two processes, with a similar pattern of increasing invasion over time but with faster invasion with the inclusion of fire, particularly in the wet-fast scenarios. SAGU staff were concerned about the number of fires that could burn to the forest edge as these could potentially lead to much larger fires and modify the frequency of fires currently observed in the forest ecosystem, and historically this fire pattern has not existed. The simulations showed that this pattern could potentially be an issue in the future, with the desert ecosystem carrying fire to the forest.</p><p id="Par37">Managers need information to support decision making despite the uncertainty surrounding future conditions, particularly forecasts of &#x0201c;tipping points&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup> such as the converted state in our simulations. Regardless of uncertainties, all scenarios had increasing buffelgrass cover at the end of the simulation, indicating that buffelgrass may invade a larger portion of the study area than that predicted in the final time step of the simulations. These commonalities across scenarios without management activities allow assessment of the potential scale of the buffelgrass problem in Saguaro National Park, addressing a second question that STSMs can be useful for in invasion contexts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. We found that scenarios spanning ranges of uncertainty related to buffelgrass infill rates all predicted increasing buffelgrass cover in the absence of management actions over a 30-year time horizon. Further, these parameters were more influential to model outcomes than initial conditions, and variation in the base infill rates had the greatest influence on the amount of buffelgrass on the landscape and the size and frequency of fires. Given the substantial differences in the predicted amount of buffelgrass on the landscape at the end of our simulations and the size and frequency of fires for dry-slow scenarios compared to wet-fast scenarios, additional research on the base infill rates of buffelgrass could greatly reduce uncertainty in model simulations and improve model performance. Our approach could be widely applied to buffelgrass in other locations where it is invading and where it could potentially impact fire cycles; answers to the research questions we have listed would inform these efforts. The approach could be used for other species as well, to help inform the widespread issue of invasive grasses and their impacts to the fire cycle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec13"><p>
