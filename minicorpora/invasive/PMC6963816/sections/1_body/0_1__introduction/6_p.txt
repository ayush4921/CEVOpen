0: Common milkweed was introduced into Europe in 1629 [ 21].
1: In the invaded range, the species occurs mainly in ruderal habitats, road verges [ 22], abandoned fields, and tree plantations [ 21].
2: The study of its ecological effects has been gaining importance given its range expansion in recent decades.
3: Invasion of common milkweed has been linked with decreased levels of native plant species cover [ 23], shifts of maximum vegetation compositional diversity to larger spatial scales in sand grasslands [ 24], and lower levels of the functional diversity of spiders [ 25] in invaded ecosystems.
4: In contrast, Jurova et al.
5: [ 26] did not find any negative effects of common milkweed in soil nematode community, while Szitar et al.
6: [ 27] showed positive effects of common milkweed on native grass survival during summer drought.
