0: In relation to invasive species, a major goal is to predict where new populations are likely to emerge.
1: Beside anthropogenic dispersal, abiotic drivers shape the large-scale distribution of invasive species.
2: Land use change is among the main determinants of biological invasion [ 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18].
3: The invasion potential of an invasive species can be determined by surveying a wide range of environments for established populations [ 6].
4: The identification of land use and other abiotic, geographical characters of the sites already invaded by invasive species can reveal potential locations suitable for new emergence [ 7, 19], which should be the focus points of early detection and rapid eradication.
