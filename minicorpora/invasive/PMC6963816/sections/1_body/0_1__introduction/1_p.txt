0: Biological invasion is considered to be one of the largest threats to native biodiversity [ 1, 2, 3].
1: Increasing eradication efforts have to be made to keep up with the growing rate of introduction and establishment of alien species [ 4].
2: Because of limited financial resources, global strategies need to identify and implement optimal management procedures against the spread of invasive species [ 5].
3: Previous studies emphasize that prevention and early detection with rapid response are the most efficient ways to combat invasion [ 2, 5].
4: Beside early detection, the monitoring of existing populations of invasive species is also part of an effective invasion control strategy [ 6].
5: Early detection should be based on a system of regular surveys to find newly established populations [ 7]; however, most of these studies lack European and national scales [ 8].
6: Applicable methods to detect species may differ between taxonomic groups, population size, and environmental settings [ 9].
7: Remote sensing data, including aerial photographs and satellite images, have been widely used to map invaders; however, they are most effective for species appearing in and dominating the canopy of the ecosystem [ 4], and when the population size is rather high [ 10].
