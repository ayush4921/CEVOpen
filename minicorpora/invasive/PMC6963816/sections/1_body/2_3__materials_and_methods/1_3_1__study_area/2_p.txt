0: The sample area has a humid continental climate, with an average annual temperature of 10.5 C and an average annual precipitation of 550 mm.
1: Agriculture is facing major challenges as a result of its more and more arid climate, which is characterized by diminishing summer rainfall, increasing drought frequency, and the significant decline in groundwater level (up to 68 m in some areas) since 1970 [ 16, 29, 33, 34].
2: Since the 1990s, the main land use changes of these areas have been arable land abandonment and the conversion of grassland to plantation.
3: The abandonment of arable land was most significant in sandy areas, which are very sensitive to drought and have poor water retention capabilities [ 16, 29, 33, 34].
