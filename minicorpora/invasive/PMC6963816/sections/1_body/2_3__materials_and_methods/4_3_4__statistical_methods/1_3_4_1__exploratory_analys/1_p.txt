0: The classified database containing 973 LUCAS survey points on common milkweed was converted into a dummy variable.
1: The created dummy variable makes it possible to explore the potential geographical driving forces and factors of common milkweed spreading.
2: After binary coding, we observed that the dummy variable had unbalanced data, i.e., the dummy value 0 (no milkweed) was overrepresented at the expense of the dummy value 1 (milkweed present).
3: The proportions were 88% and 12% for the dummy values 0 and 1, respectively ( Figure 3).
