0: The landscape photographs from the field survey points were evaluated by visual interpretation.
1: It was easy to identify the individuals or the homogenous patches of common milkweed in the field photos ( Figure A1) because of the characteristic morphological features of the plants (e.g., bright and shiny green leaves and occasionally purple inflorescences).
2: Based on the presence of common milkweed in at least one of the four photographs taken at each point, survey points were classified as 0 (no common milkweed present) and 1 (common milkweed is present; site is invaded by common milkweed) [ 12].
