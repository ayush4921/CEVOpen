0: We used various environmental covariates for identifying the geographical driving forces that may determine the occurrence of common milkweed ( Table 3).
1: They were classified into five classes, depending on their roles in landscape ecology.
2: The first class was soil, which quantifies the productivity of a habitat.
3: The second class was topography, in which covariates were selected that provided information on the vertical and horizontal distance to the channel network.
4: These were derived from the SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) 100-meter-resolution digital elevation model [ 39].
5: The third one was land cover, which was represented by the CORINE Land Cover survey products from 2012 and by the land cover change between 19902000, 20002006, and 20062012.
6: The fourth class was climate, which was characterized by the most common climatic parameters.
7: The last was geology, where the parent material was considered as a potential environmental covariate.
