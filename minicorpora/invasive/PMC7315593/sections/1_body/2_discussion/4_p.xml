<p>NO also plays a central role in regulating various physiological processes, such as flowering, stomatal closure, germination, root development, gravitropism, and the response to abiotic and biotic stresses.

 </sup> However, NO is a short-lived signal that reacts with the antioxidant glutathione to form GSNO, which then transfers its NO group to the cys thiol to form SNOs. This process, called protein S-nitrosylation, is a key redox-based post-translational modification in plants.

 </sup> Cellular SNO levels are also regulated by GSNOR. This enzyme function is conserved among bacteria, plants, and animals and plays an important role in plant de-nitrosylation.

 </sup> As demonstrated before, GSNOR efficiently removes excess SNOs to mitigate chilling damage to poplar or salt stress to alga.

 </sup> Here, the proteomics data showed that salt stress induced the accumulation of GNSOR, indicating its role in sustaining the RNS status in 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> in response to salt stress. Consistent with this, salt stress in this study also increased the activity of the GSNOR enzyme, which would limit damage to the leaves by removing excess SNOs. The finding that exposure to salt stress caused SNOs to accumulate and resulted in lower levels of GSNOR indicates that these enzymes mediate tolerance to saline stress in 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic>.
