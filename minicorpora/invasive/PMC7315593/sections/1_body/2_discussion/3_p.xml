<p>Among these differentially expressed proteins, antioxidant enzymes and defense proteins presented high expression after exposure to salt stress, suggesting that they enhance the 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> tolerance to salt stress. In agreement with this notion, salt treatment efficiently increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes in the leaves, which scavenge excess H
