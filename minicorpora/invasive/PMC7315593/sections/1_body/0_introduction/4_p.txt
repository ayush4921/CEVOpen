0: Spartina alterniflora is a perennial rhizomatous grass which is a native species in the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of North America.
1: It is considered to be an important environmental engineer in terms of silting land, repairing wetlands, and fixing carbon dioxide.
2: However, since  S. alterniflora was introduced to South China in the 1970s, it has become established as an invasive species due to its rapid growth, changing the biodiversity of the region, and disrupting the mangrove ecosystem.
3: 23  28 The biomass of  S. alterniflora could be five times greater than those of native species such as  Suaeda salsa in the coastal region of the Yangtze River Basin.
4: 29 Although  S. alterniflora has the potential to increase the soil organic carbon content and primary productivity (as well as improving the carbon sequestration capability of the flora), as a pioneer plant, it has successfully adapted to environmental stresses including flooding, high salinity, and sediment burial.
5: However, there is a dearth of literature in deciphering the mechanism by which  S. alterniflora has adapted to the saline environment.
