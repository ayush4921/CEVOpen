<p>In this study, the physiological and chemico-proteomics comparisons focused on the role of H
 <sub>2</sub>S in salt tolerance were studied in order to systemically understand the adaptation of 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> to salt stress, as compared with the native species 
 <italic>Cyperus malaccensis</italic> in southern China. Therefore, an inhibitor experiment was designed to explain the effects of H
 <sub>2</sub>S signaling on salinity tolerance in 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic>. Our study therefore demonstrated that H
 <sub>2</sub>S is a novel signal mediating tolerance to salinity stress in the invasive plant 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic>, providing important clues to control this species and curb its encroachment on native plant species.
