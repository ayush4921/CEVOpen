0: Although the small gas molecule hydrogen sulfide (H 2S) has long since been thought to be toxic, evidence shows that H 2S is the third endogenous gaseous transmitter besides nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide.
1: 1,  2 H 2S functions in a majority of physiological processes in animals, including neuronal excitability, vasorelaxation, anti-inflammatory response, smooth muscle relaxation, and blood pressure regulation.
2: 3  5 Recently, the positive effect of H 2S in improving the ability of plants to adapt to multiple environmental stimuli has also been reported.
3: 6,  7 In addition, H 2S acts as a critical signal in response to abiotic stress, modulating processes such as stomatal closure, iron availability, leaf senescence, osmotic stress, heat shock, and hypoxia stress.
4: 8  13 Cystathionine -synthase (CBS, EC4.2.1.22) and cystathionine -lyase (CSE, EC 4.4.1.1) are mainly used by mammalian cells for the synthesis of H 2S.
5: CBS hydrolyses  l-cysteine to  l-serine and CSE hydrolyses l-serine to H 2S, pyruvate, and ammonia.
6: 14 In plants, H 2S generation is mainly related with the pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP)-dependent  d/ l-cysteine desulfhydrases ( d/ l-CDs) enzymes.
7: Meanwhile, another PLP-dependent enzyme (-cyanoalanine synthase) could convert cysteine and cyanide to H 2S and -cyanoalanine.
8: 15 However, H 2S is consumed by the cysteine synthesis complex in the synthesis of  l-cys from O-acetyl serine which is catalyzed by O-acetylserine-thiol-lyase.
9: 16Arabidopsis DES1 encodes the cytosolic  l-CDes, which modulates endogenous H 2S levels in the cytosol.
10: 17 Abscisic acid (ABA), which triggers stomatal closure, induces a  DES1 expression in  Arabidopsis guard cells.
11: ABA treatment could not close the stomata in isolated epidermal strips of the  des1 mutant, and this defect was restored because of exogenous H 2S addition.
12: 18 These data demonstrate the essential function of H 2S in response to the environmental stress in the plant.
