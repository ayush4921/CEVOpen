0: In this study, the physiological and chemico-proteomics comparisons focused on the role of H 2S in salt tolerance were studied in order to systemically understand the adaptation of  S. alterniflora to salt stress, as compared with the native species  Cyperus malaccensis in southern China.
1: Therefore, an inhibitor experiment was designed to explain the effects of H 2S signaling on salinity tolerance in  S. alterniflora.
2: Our study therefore demonstrated that H 2S is a novel signal mediating tolerance to salinity stress in the invasive plant  S. alterniflora, providing important clues to control this species and curb its encroachment on native plant species.
