0: The cross-communication between H 2S and other small molecular signals, such as NO and reactive oxygen species (ROS), has been thoroughly investigated in plants exposed to biotic or abiotic stress.
1: For example,  Arabidopsis DES1 is involved in ABA-dependent NO production and stomatal closure, and NO acts downstream of H 2S in the ABA-induced stomatal closure.
2: 18 H 2S treatment also improves the tolerance of rice to salt stress or mercury toxicity.
3: 19,  20 Salt stress can induce  l- activity and raise the production of endogenous H 2S in plant  Medicago sativa.
4: Furthermore, exogenous H 2S treatment was shown to minimize the salt toxicity effects by modulating the activities of antioxidant enzymes, maintaining K +/Na + homeostasis, and preventing K +-efflux triggered by NaCl.
5: 21 H 2S also alleviates heat stress in maize, arsenate toxicity in pea, and cadmium toxicity in  Brassica through the regulation of the ascorbateglutathione cycle and ROS signaling.
6: 21 However, the mechanism by which H 2S interacts with other signals to modulate plant adaptation to environmental stress is yet to be elucidated.
7: The H 2S signal increases the activity of plasma membrane NADPH oxidase, which generates hydrogen peroxide (H 2O 2) to control stomatal closure.
