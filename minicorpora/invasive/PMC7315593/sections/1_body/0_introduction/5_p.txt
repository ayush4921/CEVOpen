0: Mass spectrometry-based chemical proteomics approaches have been used in several aspects of small molecular drug research, including identifying drug targets, verifying drug to target interaction affinity, and selectivity profiling.
1: It has also been used to profile enzyme activity at a systemic level across different samples, becoming an integrated research engine that removes the hurdle of identifying protein targets of biologically active small molecules with unknown modes of action.
