<p>To decipher the mechanism underlying 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> tolerance to NaCl stress, the responses of the invading 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> and the domestic 
 <italic>C. malaccensis</italic> to different concentrations of salt were researched. A salt concentration of 100 mM reduced the 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>v</sub>/
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>m</sub> ratio and increased ion leakage in 
 <italic>C. malaccensis</italic>, while a salt concentration of over 300 mM only somewhat decreased the 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>v</sub>/
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>m</sub> ratio and increased the ion leakage in 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.0c01275/suppl_file/ao0c01275_si_001.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Figure S1</ext-link>); when the salt concentration exceeded 500 Mm, the damage inflicted by salt toxicity was more severe, and possibly caused side effects such as unhealthy growth, extremely wilted leaves, and so forth. Thus, a salt concentration of 300 mM was selected to challenge 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> in subsequent experiments, in which 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> plants were exposed for 1, 3, and 7 days. As the control, the native species 
 <italic>C. malaccensis</italic> was simultaneously treated with 300 mM NaCl. The leaf photosynthesis capability, ion leakage, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content, important criteria to estimate the leaf damage degree, were measured. As shown in

 </xref>Aâ€“C, NaCl treatment for different periods did not markedly affect 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>v</sub>/
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>m</sub>, leaf ion leakage and MDA degree in 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic>, but markedly reduced 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>v</sub>/
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>m</sub>, and increased leaf ion leakage and MDA content in the native species 
 <italic>C. malaccensis</italic> after 3 or 5 days of NaCl treatment. These data support the notion that 
 <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> has a higher tolerance for NaCl stress than does 
 <italic>C. malaccensis</italic>.
