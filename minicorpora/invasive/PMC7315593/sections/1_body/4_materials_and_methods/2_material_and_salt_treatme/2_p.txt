0: S. alterniflora was collected in the Shanyutan wetland in the Min River Estuary, Southeast China (11934121194040 W; 260036260342 N; ca.
1: 3120 ha) ( Figure S6).
2: In this region,  S. alterniflora invaded the native species  C. malaccensis that dominated the marsh in 2004.
3: C. malaccensis occupies from the intertidal area to near the bank.
4: 57 In this experiment, the collected plants were about 25 cm in height and then transplanted into 4 L pots filled with 1 L sandy soil and irrigated with 3 L of one-fourth strength Hoaglands nutrient solution, pH 6.5.
5: The Hoaglands nutrient solution was changed every three days.
6: The plants were grown under greenhouse conditions with an average air temperature of 25/18 C (day/night), an air relative humidity ranging from 65 to 90%, and an average irradiance of 300/500 mol m 2 s 1 for 7 days, and then were subjected to salt treatment.
7: We chose a 7 day growth of plants because the roots, stems, and leaves of both plants were in a withered state after 7 days.
8: For the salt or chemical inhibitor treatment, sodium chloride (NaCl) was dissolved in the Hoaglands nutrient solution at the indicated concentrations (100, 300, 500, and 700 mM) and used to irrigate the sandy soil.
9: For the chemical inhibitor treatment, PAG and HT were dissolved in 1% dimethyl sulfoxide at 1 M as the stock solution which was then diluted into the indicated concentration with the Hoaglands solution before being used to irrigate the plants.
10: The treated leaves were collected at various time points for further analysis.
11: Three to five replicates were conducted and each replicate comprised six or ten individual plants.
12: Samples not exposed to salt or chemical treatment were used as the controls.
