0: A pulse-amplitude modulated chlorophyll fluorometer (Heinz Walz GmbH, Effeltrich, Germany) was used to measure chlorophyll fluorescence.
1: 58 After adapting the leaves in darkness for 30 min, the maximum quantum yield of PSII ( Fv/ Fm) was obtained by analyzing the entire leaf.
2: Maximal fluorescence ( Fm) and minimum fluorescence ( Fo) were obtained using a 0.8 s pulsed light at 4000 mol s 1 m 2 and the weak measuring pulses, respectively.
