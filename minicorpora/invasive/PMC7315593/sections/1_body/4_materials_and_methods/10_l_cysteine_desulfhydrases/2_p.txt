0: The activities of  l-CDs were measured as reported.
1: 63 The leaf tissue (1 g) exposed to different salt treatments was collected and ground to a fine powder using liquid nitrogen.
2: The sample was vortexed after adding 1.5 mL of cold extraction buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1% (w/v) dithiothreitol and 0.2% (w/v) sodium ascorbate].
3: The homogenate was centrifuged at 13,000 g for 15 min at 4 C and the resulting supernatant was collected for analysis of the activities of  l-CDs enzyme.
