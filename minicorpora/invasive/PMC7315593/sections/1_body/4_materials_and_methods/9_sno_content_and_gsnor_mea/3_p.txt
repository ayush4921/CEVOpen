0: GSNOR activity was tested at 25 C via recording the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) oxidation at 340 nm as reported.
1: 30 Samples exposed to different treatments were collected and quickly homogenized in liquid nitrogen, using extraction buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.2 mM NADH, and 0.5 mM EDTA) at 4 C. After centrifuging the homogenates at 3000 g for 10 min at 4 C, the supernatants were then collected for GSNOR enzyme activity assays.
2: Nanomoles NADH consumed per minute per milligram of protein (e340 6.22 mM 1 cm 1) represented the GSNOR activity.
