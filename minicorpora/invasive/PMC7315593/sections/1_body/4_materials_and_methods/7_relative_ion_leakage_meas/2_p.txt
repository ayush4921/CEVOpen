0: Relative ion leakage was determined as reported.
1: 58 The fresh leaf sample (0.5 g) and 10 mL of deionized water were kept in a petri dish at 25 C for 2 h. The first conductivity of the bathing solution was tested after incubation ( C1).
2: The second conductivity was determined after boiling the bathing solution continuously for 15 min ( C2).
3: The relative ion leakage was calculated as:  C1/ C2  100.
