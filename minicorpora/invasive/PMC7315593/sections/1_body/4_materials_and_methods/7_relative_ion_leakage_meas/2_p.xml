 </sup> The fresh leaf sample (0.5 g) and 10 mL of deionized water were kept in a petri dish at 25 °C for 2 h. The first conductivity of the bathing solution was tested after incubation (

 <sub>1</sub>). The second conductivity was determined after boiling the bathing solution continuously for 15 min (
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>). The relative ion leakage was calculated as:

 <sub>1</sub>/
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> × 100.
