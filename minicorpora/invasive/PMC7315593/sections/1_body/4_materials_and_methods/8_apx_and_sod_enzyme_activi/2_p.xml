<p>Leaf samples (1 g), 5 mL of extraction medium containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 0.1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2 mM ascorbate, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were homogenized. APX activity was determined by the decreasing of the absorbance of a reaction medium containing 50 mM
