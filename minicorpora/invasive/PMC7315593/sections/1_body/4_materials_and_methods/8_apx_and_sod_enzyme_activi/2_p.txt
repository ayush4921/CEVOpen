0: Leaf samples (1 g), 5 mL of extraction medium containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 0.1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2 mM ascorbate, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were homogenized.
1: APX activity was determined by the decreasing of the absorbance of a reaction medium containing 50 mM  N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine- N-ethanesulfonic acid-NaOH (pH 7.6), 0.25 mM ascorbate, 0.1 mM H 2O 2, and 1040 L of extract under 290 nm.
2: The SOD enzyme activity was calculated by the 50% inhibition of the photochemical reduction of NBT.
