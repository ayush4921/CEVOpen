  <p>Comparing the ion homeostasis and potassium efflux in 
   <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> and 
   <italic>C. malaccensis</italic> induced by salinity. 
   <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> and 
   <italic>C. malaccensis</italic> plants were treated with 300 mM NaCl for 7 days. The leaves were collected at the indicated time points, and the Na
   <sup>+</sup> and K
   <sup>+</sup> contents and Na
   <sup>+</sup>/K
   <sup>+</sup> ratio were measured (A). Time-course analysis of the transient net K
   <sup>+</sup> efflux (B) was performed using the noninjuring technique after the addition of salt. The average K extrusion during 20 min of NaCl stress was also determined (C). Data represent mean ± SE of three replicate experiments. Means denoted by different letters show significant differences at 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 according to Tukey’s test.
