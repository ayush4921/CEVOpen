 <caption> Protein species expression profiles from the leaves of S. alterniflora after exposure to salt stress. Hierarchical clustering (A), functional classification, and (B) Venn diagram analysis of protein species expression profiles in S. alterniflora leaf samples obtained after different periods of salt stress treatment. The hierarchical cluster analysis was conducted using Cluster 3.0 and Treeview software ( http://bonsai.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/?mdehoon/software/cluster). The different colors correspond to the log-transformed values of the protein species change-fold ratio shown in the bar at the bottom of the figure (C). Data represent mean Â± SE of three replicate experiments. </caption>
