 <caption> H 2S signal and GSNOR activity modulated ROS and RNS generation, antioxidant enzyme activities, ion homeostasis, and leaf viability in S. alterniflora after exposure to salt stress. Seven-day-old S. alterniflora plants were treated with 300 mM NaCl with or without the H 2S biosynthesis inhibitor PAG (2 mM) or scavenger HT (100 μM). After 3 days of treatment, the accumulation of H 2O 2 and O 2 –, the activities of APX and SOD, the generation of SNOs, and GSNOR activity were measured (A). The effect of HT and DA on the net K + efflux was monitored by the noninjuring technique after the addition of salt (B). The inset shows the mean efflux rates 0–20 min after treatment. Furthermore, the effects of PAG and HT on the MDA content and F v/ F m ratio were evaluated in S. alterniflora leaves (C). Data represent mean ± SE of three replicate experiments. Means denoted by different letters show significant differences at p &lt; 0.05 according to Tukey’s test. </caption>
