  <p>Comparing the generation of H
   <sub>2</sub>S in 
   <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> and 
   <italic>C. malaccensis</italic> induced by salinity. 
   <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> and 
   <italic>C. malaccensis</italic> plants were treated with 300 mM NaCl. At the indicated time points, the leaves of 
   <italic>S. alterniflora</italic> and 
   <italic>C. malaccensis</italic> plants were collected, the H
   <sub>2</sub>S content (upper) and 
   <sc>l</sc>-CD activity (bottom) were measured. Data represent mean Â± SE of three replicate experiments.
