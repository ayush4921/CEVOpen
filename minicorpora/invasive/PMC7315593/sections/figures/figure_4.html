 <caption> Comparing the generation of H 2S in S. alterniflora and C. malaccensis induced by salinity. S. alterniflora and C. malaccensis plants were treated with 300 mM NaCl. At the indicated time points, the leaves of S. alterniflora and C. malaccensis plants were collected, the H 2S content (upper) and l-CD activity (bottom) were measured. Data represent mean Â± SE of three replicate experiments. </caption>
