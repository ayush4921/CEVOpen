    "H<sub>2</sub>S is a small molecule known to have multiple signaling roles in animals. Recently, evidence shows that H<sub>2</sub>S also has signaling functions in plants; however, the role of H<sub>2</sub>S in invasive plants is unknown. <i>Spartina alterniflora</i> is a typical invasive species growing along the beaches of southern China. A physiological comparison proves that <i>S. alterniflora</i> is highly tolerant to salinity stress compared with the native species <i>Cyperus malaccensis</i>. To decipher the mechanism that enables <i>S. alterniflora</i> to withstand salinity stress, a chemico-proteomics analysis was performed to examine the salt stress response of the two species; an inhibitor experiment was additionally designed to investigate H<sub>2</sub>S signaling on salinity tolerance in <i>S. alterniflora</i>. A total of 86 proteins belonging to nine categories were identified and differentially expressed in <i>S. alterniflora</i> exposed to salt stress. Moreover, the expression level of enzymes responsible for the H<sub>2</sub>S biosynthesis was markedly upregulated, indicating the potential role of H<sub>2</sub>S signaling in the plant's response to salt stress. The results suggested that salt triggered l-CD enzyme activity and induced the production of H<sub>2</sub>S, therefore upregulating expression of the antioxidants ascorbate peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and S-nitrosoglutathione reductase, which mitigates damage from reactive nitrogen species. Additionally, H<sub>2</sub>S reduced the potassium efflux, thereby sustaining intracellular sodium/potassium ion homeostasis and enhancing <i>S. alterniflora</i> salt tolerance. These findings indicate that H<sub>2</sub>S plays an important role in the adaptation of <i>S. alterniflora</i> to saline environments, which provides greater insight into the function of H<sub>2</sub>S signaling in the adaptation of an invasive plant species."
