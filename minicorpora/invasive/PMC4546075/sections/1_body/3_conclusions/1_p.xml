<p>In conclusion, we find that invasive populations of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> represent a smaller proportion of the genetic diversity of the native range than what is typically found for outcrossing invasive species. Relatively low genetic diversity is thus possible in widespread invasive species even after multiple introductions. This suggests a possible role for phenotypic plasticity in facilitating the spread of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> across Europe.
