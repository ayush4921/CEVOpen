<p>The reduction in diversity detected was, however, also larger than the one reported by Nagy and Korpelainen [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] for four Finnish populations (48 %) and a UK population (26 %). Different introductions giving rise to the populations in these studies could contribute different amounts of genetic diversity, through the introduction of different number of individuals or individuals carrying different amounts of diversity. Additionally, post-introduction genetic drift can differ between populations. Although the even distribution of genetic diversity over Europe and the generally low number of private alleles suggest a primary role of founder effects, the fact that between any two European populations only about 32 % of the alleles are shared (34 % and 36 % in the southern and northern European clusters, respectively), indicates that also post-introduction genetic drift, introductions from other parts of the native range or other evolutionary processes have played a role. Like invasive species in general (Additional file

 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> in Europe, however, seems not to have been accompanied by an increase in the level of inbreeding.
