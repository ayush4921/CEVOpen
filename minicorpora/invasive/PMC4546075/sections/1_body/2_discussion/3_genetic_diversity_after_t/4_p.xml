<p>Bottlenecks, such as those occurring during the colonisation of a new area, are expected to lead to a loss of genetic diversity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>] and diversity levels can change during the course of a species invasion history [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. Genetic diversity can, for example, be lost through high genetic drift in small populations colonizing new parts of the invasive range. Only among the northernmost populations could we detect the effects of past population bottlenecks. It has, however, been pointed out that even strong bottlenecks can be difficult to detect with heterozygosity-excess based tests such as the one implemented in BOTTLENECK [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>], and undetected bottlenecks could have occurred in the recent history of additional populations. Furthermore, if the sampled populations correspond to biological populations, the pooling of populations in the two- and three-population group sets (as suggested from STRUCTURE analysis) may have inflated the amount of homozygosity and reduced our capacity of detecting excess heterozygosity. Of the populations indicated as having undergone a bottleneck from the shifted allele frequency distribution, the population Trondheim2, was particularly conspicuous with few alleles and a low genetic diversity. In addition the highly negative inbreeding coefficient from excess heterozygosity could be a consequence of among other things a recent bottleneck, disassortative mating or higher than random rates of outcrossing in this population.
