<p>A general loss in genetic diversity upon invasion is apparent in the studies reviewed by us (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>) and has also been noted in plants previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>]. Although we have not sampled the source population of European 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic>, and our results should be interpreted with caution, it is likely that the Kashmir populations are representative enough that conclusions can still be drawn. The low total genetic diversity after introduction in 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> is a more drastic reduction (55 %) than that detected in many invasive species so far, with an average diversity reduction of 11 % (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>). Even when restricting our comparison to species with only a single or a few reported introductions the proportion of post- to pre-introduction genetic diversity was lower in 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> than in most other species (average increase of 2 %, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>). This may at least in part be explained by the high inter-annual variation in population size in 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic>, where large populations can decline dramatically in size and sometimes go extinct [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. This leads to increased genetic drift and potentially higher loss of genetic diversity than in species with more stable population sizes.
