<p>Beyond the populations Trondheim1 and Trondheim2 we found little direct evidence of past bottlenecks, though European populations of 
 <italic>I. glandulifera</italic> had still, on average lost as much as about 70 % of the diversity of the populations in the species’ native range in Kashmir. This was true for both number of alleles and genetic diversity, suggesting major loss of genetic diversity during the introduction to Europe and subsequent spread of the species. The loss of diversity is particularly striking given the small geographical area sampled in Kashmir.
