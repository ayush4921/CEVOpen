0: A stronger support for the regional division comes from our ABC modelling of the population history of the samples where estimates of the time of separation for southern European and northern European  I. glandulifera show that it most likely predates the species introduction in Europe.
1: If the regional division is an artefact of isolation by distance we expect populations in the two regions to have separated from each other only after the species colonised Europe.
2: Although the ABC modelling produced a large range for the estimates of the time since separation and a divergence after the introduction in Europe is possible from the analysis of European data only, a separation pre-dating the introduction in Europe is more likely and suggests at least two independent introductions.
3: The fact that Stockholm individuals cluster away from all other European individuals in the PCA (Fig.
4: 3b) and in the four-cluster STRUCTURE analysis of European individuals tentatively suggests this might be the result of yet another introduction.
5: In conclusion, we find support for multiple introductions of  I. glandulifera but note the possibility of it also being an artefact of the presence of isolation by distance.
