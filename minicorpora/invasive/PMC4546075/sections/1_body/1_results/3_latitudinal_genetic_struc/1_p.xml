<p>In the STRUCTURE analysis of the full dataset ΔK suggested K = 3 (ΔK = 27413) as the number of clusters best describing the data (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). This was also the level of clustering with the highest repeatability between runs according to CLUMPP H values (H = 0.996, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). At this level one cluster contained the Kashmir populations (with the exception of Stockholm already separated from the European populations at K = 2, ΔK = 8145.4, H = 0.985), another the more southern European populations (Amiens1, Amiens2, Ghent, Bremen, Lund1 and Lund2) and a final cluster the northern European populations (Stockholm, Trondheim1 – 3) (Fig.
