<p>Principal component analysis (PCA) of the full dataset clearly separated the Kashmir (black and grey) from the European populations (in colour) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>) along the first two principal components (PCs). The wider spread of Kashmir individuals along PC1 and PC2 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>) reflected the higher genetic diversity present in the Kashmir populations. Analysis of only the European individuals showed three individuals from Amiens1 to be highly divergent (data not shown). This proved to be the result of their genotypes at the A2 locus and excluding these genotypes from the analysis mostly removed the divergence of these individuals. After removal of the deviant A2 genotypes almost all the individuals of the Stockholm population clustered separately from all other European individuals, while the rest showed partial overlap with a gradual transition across a roughly geographical gradient (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>) (correlation latitude vs PC1: r = −0.653; latitude vs PC2: r = −0.576; longitude vs PC1: r = −0.710; longitude vs PC2: r = −0.184; all
