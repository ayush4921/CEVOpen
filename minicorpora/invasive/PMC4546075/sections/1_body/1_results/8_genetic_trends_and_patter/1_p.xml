<p>Comparing the genetic diversity of invasive plant species in their native and invasive ranges from 39 published studies showed that genetic diversity in the native ranges was significantly higher than the diversity in the invasive ranges (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>, paired Wilcoxon rank sum test, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). A diversity in the invasive range similar to that of the native range was, however, not uncommon. In the 41 comparisons that identified a number of introductions, the majority, 32, suggested multiple introductions and only five a single origin of the invasive species (Additional file
