0: The expected heterozygosity under HWE (h) was calculated with a purpose-written Perl script (available upon request).
1: GenePop [ 82,  86] was used to test for deviations from HWE.
2: FreeNA [ 13] was used to test for the presence of null alleles and for obtaining estimates of F ST [ 105] and D CH, the Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards genetic distance [ 12].
3: Adjusting genetic diversity, F ST and D CH for the presence of null alleles did not affect the conclusions drawn and these measures are therefore not reported.
4: D S (Neis genetic distance [ 65]) and R ST, an equivalent of F ST using a stepwise mutation model, [ 85,  91] were calculated using Spagedi v 1.4 [ 35] and differences between R ST and F ST were tested using the permutation test implemented in the software.
5: D CH and D S were highly correlated (r = 0.949, Pearsons productmoment correlation, p < < 0.001) and only the former is reported.
