0: Geographic structure was further explored using R v 3.0.3 [ 81] to carry out DAPC analysis [ 43], using the  Adegenet package, and PCA.
1: The number of copies present in an individual (0, 1 or 2) for each allele at each locus was treated as independent variables in the PCA.
2: In addition, R was used to test for correlations between latitude and genetic diversity and the two main principal components in PCA respectively as well as between geographic distance and pairwise F ST, R ST, number of alleles and genetic distance respectively, using Pearsons productmoment correlation.
3: R was also used to carry out t-tests, or alternatively the Wilcoxon rank sum test if the underlying assumptions of parametric tests were not met.
