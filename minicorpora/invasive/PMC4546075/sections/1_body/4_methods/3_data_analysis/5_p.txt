0: We used the ABC approach implemented in DIYABC [ 17] to infer past demographic history and try to distinguish between one or two origins of  I. glandulifera in Europe.
1: We compared two models, one where all European populations first separate from the Kashmir populations followed by a later split into a southern and a northern regional cluster, and one with a southern regional cluster first splitting from the remaining populations, followed by a second split between a northern cluster and the Kashmir populations (Additional file  6).
2: In addition only European populations were analysed in a scenario where a single ancestral population split into the southern and northern regional clusters.
3: Both the direct and the logistic approaches implemented in DIYABC were used and parameter priors for the different scenarios including effective population sizes, time of splitting and mutation models are given in Additional file  9.
