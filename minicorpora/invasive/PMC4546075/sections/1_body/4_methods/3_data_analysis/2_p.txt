0: Hierarchical AMOVA, F IS and tests for LD (using 10000 permutations) were calculated and carried out using Arlequin v 3.5.1.3 [ 25].
1: For AMOVA of the full dataset continent and municipality were both used as the highest hierarchical level while the European dataset was analysed with both region and municipality as the highest hierarchical level.
2: Analyses with municipality as the highest hierarchical level included also municipalities for which only a single population was available.
3: Bayes-Ass v 3.0 [ 107] was used to estimate migration between populations.
4: BOTTLENECK v 1.2.02 [ 16] was used to detect recent population bottlenecks among the studied populations.
5: For the BOTTLENECK analysis, a two-population group set (all European individuals and all Kashmir individuals, respectively), a three-population group set (northern European individuals from Stockholm and Trondheim, remaining southern European individuals and Kashmir individuals respectively) and a 13-population group set (each sampled population treated as a separate unit) were analysed under a stepwise mutation model.
6: Due to the low number of markers analysed heterozygosity was tested using the Wilcoxon sign-rank test.
