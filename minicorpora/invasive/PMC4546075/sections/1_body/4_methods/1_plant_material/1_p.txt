0: Populations of  I. glandulifera (2n = 18, 20) with at least 30 flowering individuals were sampled in 2011 from six municipalities, the local area around a town or city, along a 1600 km latitudinal gradient in Western Europe.
1: Populations were also sampled from Kashmir, India (Fig.
2: 1), the part of the native range suggested to be the source of the plants originally introduced into Europe [ 6,  57] (Table  1).
3: The populations ranged in size from less than 100 individuals to more than 1000 and were located both nearby and away from waterways.
4: In each municipality, one to three populations were sampled (Table  1) with a minimum distance of 1.8 km between each population.
5: The maximum distance between the Kashmir populations was 6.4 km.
6: From each population leaf material from 30 randomly sampled individuals was collected and stored in tubes containing silica gel until used for analysis.
7: Sampling was done according to national legislations and samples were destroyed upon molecular analysis.
8: A map showing the location of the sampled populations (Fig.
9: 1) was drawn using Ocean Data View version 4.7.2 [ 88].
