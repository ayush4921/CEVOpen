0: Plant tissue was dried overnight at 45 C, after which total DNA was extracted using the E-Z 96 Plant DNA Kit (Omega Bio-tek Inc., Norcross, GA, USA), following the manufacturers recommendations.
1: Eleven already published microsatellite loci [ 78,  100] were used for PCR amplification.
2: Multiplex PCR was performed with the Qiagen Multiplex PCR Kit (Qiagen) using a 17.5 l reaction with 1 x Qiagen Mastermix and 0.1  0.4 M of each primer.
3: PCR was carried out with an initial 15 min denaturation at 95 C followed by 30 cycles of 94 C for 30 s, 55 C for 90 s and 72 C for 60 s with a final elongation for 10 min at 72 C. Microsatellite lengths were determined by running the PCR products on a Genetic Analyzer 3130xl (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA), and the resulting data were analysed with Geneious v 6.1.8 (BiomatesLtd, Auckland, New Zealand).
