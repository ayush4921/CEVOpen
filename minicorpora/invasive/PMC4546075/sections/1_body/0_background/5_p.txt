0: In its native range  I. glandulifera grows at altitudes of 2000  4000 m a.s.l.
1: from Kashmir to Garhwal in the Northern Indian state of Uttarakhand [ 6,  75] (Fig.
2: 1).
3: The first documented European introduction of  I. glandulifera was from Kashmir to the British Isles in 1839, where it was initially grown in the Kew Gardens [ 6,  15,  57].
4: Originally an ornamental garden flower, it was first recorded as a naturalised plant in 1855 [ 9].
5: During the 19 th and 20 th century the species gradually spread across the continent [ 9,  33,  37,  47,  67,  73,  80,  95,  97].
6: The increasingly more northern reports suggest spread may have happened in a step-by-step fashion from the range frontier, which, if true, should be evident through decreasing genetic diversity in more northern latitudes.
7: The species is now widespread in Europe and found up to 64 N [ 5].
8: Seeds and seedlings have been brought to Europe on several occasions [ 47], but it is not known from which introduction(s)  I. glandulifera populations presently found in Europe descend.
