0: The successful invasiveness of some species in spite of low genetic diversity is commonly referred to as the genetic paradox of invasive species [ 28].
1: It has, however, been shown that high genetic diversity is not a prerequisite for an invasive species to be successful [ 21] and some studies suggest phenotypic plasticity is instrumental for invasiveness [ 52,  72].
2: Others instead stress the importance of rapid evolutionary responses [ 11,  22,  53].
3: Molecular population genetics can be instrumental in exploring the importance of genetic components of invasiveness [ 51].
4: For example, although loss of genetic diversity is expected upon colonisation of new areas, it has been suggested that high genetic diversity, resulting from multiple introductions, could be what allows a species to become invasive [ 69].
