0: Phylogeographic analysis of intraspecific genetic variation can be used to explore the migration history of a species, including species that have recently colonized an area (e.g.
1: [ 41,  87] and references therein).
2: For invasive species, phylogeographic analyses can provide information about the source population(s) in an invaders native range, as well as elucidate patterns of spread within the species novel range (e.g.
3: [ 68,  84,  108]).
4: Additionally, phylogeographic patterns and the distribution of genetic diversity within and between populations can shed light on human facilitation of spread and thus aid in developing suitable management strategies [ 101].
