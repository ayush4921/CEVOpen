0: Most studies on  I. glandulifera so far have described the spread of the species on a local or countrywide scale [ 33,  80], or have tried to elucidate the mechanism for its invasiveness [ 79,  80,  90].
1: In addition, differences in growth and phenology of  I. glandulifera have been shown to be correlated with latitudinal origin, suggesting adaptation to the length of the growing season [ 46].
2: Recently, the genetic diversity of  I. glandulifera on a local or countrywide scale has been described for British [ 78,  100], Lithuanian [ 110] and Finnish [ 64] populations.
3: To our knowledge, however, there have been no population genetic studies sampling  I. glandulifera across a larger part of its European distribution.
