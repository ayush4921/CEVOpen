0: Invasive plant species are becoming increasingly common and can threaten biodiversity across the world [ 31].
1: Apart from being of biological importance  frequently having a negative effect on local plant communities [ 56,  58,  99]  invasive species also provide particular opportunities to study ecological and evolutionary processes [ 39].
2: Being just a subset of the species-wide gene pool, possibly suffering severe loss of genetic diversity upon the invasion [ 4,  66], they are nonetheless able to thrive in a novel environment and thereby provide useful study systems for responses to rapid environmental changes [ 21,  39].
