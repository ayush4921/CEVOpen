0: Impatiens glandulifera Royle (Balsaminaceae), the Himalayan Balsam, is an invasive species in Europe (e.g.
1: [ 18,  80]), North America and New Zealand [ 96,  104] with the ability to outcompete native species, particularly in riparian habitats [ 6,  40].
2: It is pollinated by insects but can also self-pollinate [ 80].
3: Dehiscence of the seed capsule spreads seeds up to a distance of 5 m while long-distance dispersal is primarily carried out by man or water currents [ 6].
4: Being an annual species it can, upon senescence, leave riverbanks exposed to winter erosion and during the growth season its roots can block and threaten land drainage schemes [ 80].
