0: Here we assess both local and more large-scale patterns of genetic diversity in  I. glandulifera by characterising the molecular genetics of populations both from the species native range in Kashmir (India) and the introduced range within Europe across a large part of the species invaded north  south distribution.
1: The main aims of our study were 1) to investigate the number of introductions into Western Europe, 2) to compare the genetic diversity of the species and its distribution in the invaded and native range, 3) to explore the importance of evolutionary forces, in particular gene flow, between populations in shaping the distribution of genetic diversity in the invasive range and 4) to compare our results with general population genetic patterns in invasive species.
