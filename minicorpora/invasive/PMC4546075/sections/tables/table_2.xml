  <p>Posterior probabilities with 95 % confidence intervals (in brackets) for the two scenarios used in ABC analysis of the population history of the full Impatiens glandulifera dataset. Posterior probabilities were measured using the 50 and 1000 closest datasets for the direct and logistic approaches respectively, out of 1 000 000 simulated datasets. Model scenarios as presented in Additional file 6</p>
