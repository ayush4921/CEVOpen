 <caption> Simulated proportions of the classical and emerging strains in the landscape: before and after the observation window. The simulation results presented here correspond to the middle of the intra-annual stage (2nd week of June), and were obtained with the MLE \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${\Theta }^{*}$$\end{document} Θ ∗ . The colors of the shaded regions indicate which strain is the most prevalent. The red regions correspond to the classical strain; blue: ES 1, ES 2 (these two strains have the same density, only ES 1 is represented); green: ES 3; pink: ES 4. </caption>
