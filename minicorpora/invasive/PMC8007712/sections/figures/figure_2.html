 <caption> Proportions of the classical and emerging strains in the landscape: data and simulations. The colors of the shaded regions indicate which strain is the most prevalent. The red regions correspond to the CS strain; light blue and blue: ES 1, ES 2 (these two strains have the same density, only ES 1 is represented); green: ES 3; pink: ES 4. The pie charts describe the relative proportions of the strains found in the data (same color legend). The white crosses on the 2004 panel represent the estimated sites of introduction. The simulation results presented here correspond to the middle of the intra-annual stage (2nd week of June), and were obtained with the MLE \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\varvec{\Theta}^{*}$$\end{document} Θ ∗ . </caption>
