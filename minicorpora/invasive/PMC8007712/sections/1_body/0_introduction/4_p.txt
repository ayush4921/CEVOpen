0: Mechanistic models are increasingly used in statistical ecology because, compared to purely correlative approaches, their parameters can directly inform on biological processes and life history traits.
1: Among them, the reactiondiffusion framework is widely used in spatial ecology to model dynamic species distributions 26,  27.
2: In such models, the diffusion coefficient is related to dispersal ability and the growth or competition coefficients may help in understanding the respective interactions between different species, variants or genotypes.
3: Additionally, reactiondiffusion models can easily account for spatio-temporal heterogeneities 28,  29.
4: A drawback of this type of approach is that the compartments that are modelled typically correspond to continuous population densities, which rarely match with observation data.
5: There is therefore a challenge in connecting the solution of the model with complex data, such as noisy data, binary data, temporally and spatially censored data.
6: Recent approaches have been proposed to bridge the gap between reactiondiffusion models and data (e.g., 30, in a framework known as mechanistic-statistical modelling 31  33.
7: An advantage of this method is that it allows to estimate simultaneously both the biological parameters and the date and place of introduction in a single framework 22.
8: Recently, this type of approach was applied to localize and date the invasion of South Corsica by  Xylella fastidiosa, based on a single-species reactiondiffusion model and binary data 11.
