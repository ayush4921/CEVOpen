 </sup>, whereas some have only been observed punctually with no long term establishment of the pathogens
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>
 </sup>. As plant viruses are rapidly-evolving pathogens with small genomes and high mutation rates
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
 </sup>, they may present measurably evolving populations
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup> over the time scale of decades. Thus, the spatio-temporal histories of invading species can sometimes be reconstructed from georeferenced and dated genomic data, with phylogeographic methodologies
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>
 </sup> or population dynamic models embedding evolutionary processes. Over shorter time-scales, or when only abundance data are available, recent mechanistic modelling approaches have been proposed to infer the date and place of introduction of a single species along with other demographic parameters
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>
 </sup>. In many modeling approaches, the interactions of the new viruses or new strains with preexisting virus populations are not taken into consideration, even if it is known that synergism or competition between virus species or strains can affect their maintenance and spread
