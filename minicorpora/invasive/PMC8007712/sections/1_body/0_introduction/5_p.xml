<p id="Par6">Our objective here is to propose a modelling framework to deal with multiple introductions by several invasive variants, in competition with a resident population, when observations provide knowledge on the relative proportions of each variant at some dates and places rather than absolute abundances of the different variants. We develop a reactionâ€“diffusion mechanistic-statistical model applied to a genetic spatio-temporal dataset reporting the relative proportions of five genetic variants of watermelon mosaic virus (WMV, genus 
 <italic>Potyvirus</italic>, family 
 <italic>Potyviridae</italic>) in infections of commercial cucurbit fields. Our framework allows us to (1) estimate the dates and places of successful introduction of each emerging variant along with other ecological parameters, (2) reconstruct the invasion history of the emerging variants from their introduction sites, (3) detect competitive advantages of the emerging variants as compared to the resident population, and (4) predict the fate of the different genetic groups, in particular the takeover of the emerging variants over the resident population.
