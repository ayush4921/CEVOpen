<p id="Par3">Where and when alien organisms are successfully introduced are central questions for the study of biological invasions, to elucidate biotic and abiotic conditions favorable to the introduction and establishment and spread of invasive species

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>
 </sup>. Indeed, unraveling such conditions is a prerequisite to map the risk of invasion and to design an efficient surveillance strategy
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>
 </sup> as initial phases are critical for the establishment success of introduced pathogens
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>
 </sup>. It is also during this phase that invaders are the easiest to control
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>
 </sup>. In addition, a precise knowledge of the dates and places of introduction is critical to accurately determine invader reproduction and dispersal parameters, as their estimated values are directly dependent on the time and distance between the actual introduction and the observations
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup>. However, biological invasions by alien organisms are often reported several years after the initial successful introduction event
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
 </sup>. Thus, monitoring data generally do not provide a clear picture of the date and place of introduction.
