<p id="Par5">Mechanistic models are increasingly used in statistical ecology because, compared to purely correlative approaches, their parameters can directly inform on biological processes and life history traits. Among them, the reaction–diffusion framework is widely used in spatial ecology to model dynamic species distributions

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>
 </sup>. In such models, the diffusion coefficient is related to dispersal ability and the growth or competition coefficients may help in understanding the respective interactions between different species, variants or genotypes. Additionally, reaction–diffusion models can easily account for spatio-temporal heterogeneities

 </sup>. A drawback of this type of approach is that the compartments that are modelled typically correspond to continuous population densities, which rarely match with observation data. There is therefore a challenge in connecting the solution of the model with complex data, such as noisy data, binary data, temporally and spatially censored data. Recent approaches have been proposed to bridge the gap between reaction–diffusion models and data (e.g.,

 </sup>. An advantage of this method is that it allows to estimate simultaneously both the biological parameters and the date and place of introduction in a single framework
