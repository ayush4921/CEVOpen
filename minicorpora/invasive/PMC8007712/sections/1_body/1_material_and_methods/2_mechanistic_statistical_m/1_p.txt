0: The general modeling strategy is based on a mechanistic-statistical approach 12,  22,  33.
1: This type of approach combines a mechanistic model describing the dynamics under investigation with a probabilistic model conditional on the dynamics, describing how the measurements have been collected.
2: This method that has already proved its theoretical effectiveness in determining dispersal parameters using simulated genetic data 12 aims at bridging the gap between the data and the model for the determination of virus dynamics.
