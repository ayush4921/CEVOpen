0: WMV is widespread in cucurbit crops, mostly in temperate and Mediterranean climatic regions of the world 16.
1: WMV has a wide host range including some legumes, orchids and many weeds that can be alternative hosts 16.
2: Like other potyviruses, it is non-persistently transmitted by at least 30 aphid species 16.
3: In temperate regions, WMV causes summer epidemics on cucurbit crops, and it can overwinter in several common non-cucurbit weeds when no crops are present 16,  34.
4: WMV has been common in France for more than 40 years, causing mosaics on leaves and fruits in melon, but mostly mild symptoms on zucchini squash.
5: Since 2000, new symptoms were observed in southeastern France on zucchini squash: leaf deformations and mosaics, as well as fruit discoloration and deformations that made them unmarketable.
6: This new agronomic problem was correlated to the introduction of new molecular groups of WMV strains.
7: At least four new groups have emerged since 2000 and they have rapidly replaced the native classical strains, causing important problems for the producers 35.
8: These new groups, hereafter emerging strains (ES) are significantly more related molecularly to worldwide strains than to any other isolates from the French populations 36.
9: As emphasised in 35, this supports that the new group of emerging strains has arisen through introductions, mostly from Southeastern Asia, rather than through local differentiation.
