<p id="Par7">WMV is widespread in cucurbit crops, mostly in temperate and Mediterranean climatic regions of the world

 </sup>. WMV has a wide host range including some legumes, orchids and many weeds that can be alternative hosts

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>
 </sup>. Like other potyviruses, it is non-persistently transmitted by at least 30 aphid species
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>
 </sup>. In temperate regions, WMV causes summer epidemics on cucurbit crops, and it can overwinter in several common non-cucurbit weeds when no crops are present

 </sup>. WMV has been common in France for more than 40 years, causing mosaics on leaves and fruits in melon, but mostly mild symptoms on zucchini squash. Since 2000, new symptoms were observed in southeastern France on zucchini squash: leaf deformations and mosaics, as well as fruit discoloration and deformations that made them unmarketable. This new agronomic problem was correlated to the introduction of new molecular groups of WMV strains. At least four new groups have emerged since 2000 and they have rapidly replaced the native “classical” strains, causing important problems for the producers
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>
 </sup>. These new groups, hereafter “emerging strains” (ES) are significantly more related molecularly to worldwide strains than to any other isolates from the French populations

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>
 </sup>. As emphasised in
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>
 </sup>, this supports that the new group of emerging strains has arisen through introductions, mostly from Southeastern Asia, rather than through local differentiation.
