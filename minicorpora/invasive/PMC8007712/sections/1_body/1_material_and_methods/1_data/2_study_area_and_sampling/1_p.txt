1: Between 2004 and 2008, the presence of WMV had been monitored in collaboration with farmers, farm advisers and seed companies.
2: Each year, cultivated host plants were collected in different fields and at different dates between May 1st and September 30th.
3: In total, more than two thousand plant samples were collected over the entire study area.
4: All plant samples were analyzed in the INRAE Plant Pathology Unit to confirm the presence of WMV and determine the molecular type of the virus strain causing the infection (see 35 for detail on field and laboratory protocols).
5: All infected host plants were cucurbits, mostly melon and different squashes (e.g., zucchini, pumpkins).
