0:  In the absence of individual geographic coordinates, all infected host plants were attributed to the centroid of the municipality (French administrative unit, median size about 10 km 2) where they have been collected.
1: Then for one date, one observation corresponded to a municipality in which at least one infected host plant was sampled.
2: Table  1 summarizes for each year, the number of observations (i.e.
3: number of municipalities), the number of infected plants sampled and the proportion of each WMV strain (CS, and ES 1 to ES 4) found in the infected host plants.
4: Errors in assignment of virus samples to the CS or ES strains was negligible because of the large genetic distance separating them: 5 to 10% nucleotide divergence both in the fragment used in the study and in complete genomes 35, also precluding the possibility of local jumps between groups by accumulation of mutations.
