<p id="Par10"> In the absence of individual geographic coordinates, all infected host plants were attributed to the centroid of the municipality (French administrative unit, median size about 10 km
 <sup>2</sup>) where they have been collected. Then for one date, one observation corresponded to a municipality in which at least one infected host plant was sampled. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> summarizes for each year, the number of observations (i.e. number of municipalities), the number of infected plants sampled and the proportion of each WMV strain (CS, and ES
 <sub>1</sub> to ES
 <sub>4</sub>) found in the infected host plants. Errors in assignment of virus samples to the CS or ES strains was negligible because of the large genetic distance separating them: 5 to 10% nucleotide divergence both in the fragment used in the study and in complete genomes
