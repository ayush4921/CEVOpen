<p id="Par30">As shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, the MLE corresponds to the same date of introduction for ES
 <sub>1</sub>, ES
 <sub>2</sub>, ES
 <sub>3</sub> whereas ES
 <sub>4</sub> has been introduced five years later. Note that a same date of introduction does not mean a same date of detection: depending on local conditions, some strains may establish and spread faster than others (as observed below for ES
 <sub>4</sub>).
