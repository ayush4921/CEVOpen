<p id="Par31">Regarding the sites of introduction, the MLE indicates that ES
 <sub>1</sub> and ES
 <sub>2</sub> have been introduced at the northeastern corner of the study area, ES
 <sub>3</sub> in the northwest and ES
 <sub>4</sub> in the southwest (see the white crosses in the 2004 panel of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; see also Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref> for more details on the corresponding likelihood). Three introduction points (ESs 1, 2 and 3) were estimated at the edge of the study site, indicating that the introductions may have occurred outside of the study area.
