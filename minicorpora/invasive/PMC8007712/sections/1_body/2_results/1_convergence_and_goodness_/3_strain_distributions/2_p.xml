<p id="Par34">The spatial distributions of the different strains at each year where one of the emerging strains becomes locally more prevalent are depicted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. Although ESs 1, 2 and 3 have been introduced at the same date, their dynamics are influenced by local conditions: ESs 1 and 2 become the most prevalent at least in one part of the study area in 1996 (6 years after their introduction), ES
 <sub>3</sub> in 2001 (11 years after introduction) and ES
 <sub>4</sub> in 2002 (7 years after its introduction). Thus, despite the neutrality assumption, the heterogeneity of the landscape leads to different durations of the establishment stage. The full timeline of the dynamics of the different strain proportions in the landscape, from the first estimated introduction date of an emerging strain (1990) to 2019 is available as Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>. Since 2008, due to their competitive advantage (modelled here as a lower winter decay rate), the ESs replaced the CS, which is not anymore the most prevalent strain, whatever the position in the study area, 18 years after the first introduction. Before saturation, the spread rates of the ESs are about 5 km/year (estimated as the slope of
