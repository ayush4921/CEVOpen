 </inline-formula>, together with the data. We graphically note a good agreement between the positions of the observed strains and the distributions obtained with the model: ES
 <sub>1</sub> and ES
 <sub>2</sub> tend to be distributed in the eastern part of the study area, ES
 <sub>3</sub> in the northwestern part and ES
 <sub>4</sub> in the southwestern part, while the CS strain tends to be progressively confined to the central part of the study area. In 2007, ES
 <sub>3</sub> seems to be more prevalent according to the model than suggested by the observations, probably due to its introduction site, which is far from the observation sites (see the first panel in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Note that, with the deterministic framework used here, as ES
 <sub>1</sub> and ES
 <sub>2</sub> share the same date and position of introduction, and the same parameter values, their distributions are completely equal; thus only ES
 <sub>1</sub> is represented in the figures.
