<p id="Par42">In a more general perspective, this study shows how mechanistic approaches can be used to infer the historical dynamics of invasive genotypes or species from initial introduction. These approaches enable considering hypothetical scenarios, to get a better understanding of the impact of the biological interactions on the overall dynamics. Here, in agreement with theoretical results in

 </sup>, the simulations without the CS strain showed that its presence promotes a higher diversity among the emerging strains, by altering the outcome of the competition between the ESs, and by slowing down the overall dynamics, thus reducing founder effects. Another advantage of using a mechanistic-statistical approach, compared to a correlative approach, is that the parameter values bring some insight into biological processes and life history traits, (e.g. the diffusion coefficient is related to dispersal ability). Good knowledge of the parameter values, especially for the biological parameters, will be helpful for future modelling, either with reaction–diffusion models or with other approaches such as stochastic diffusion models, which share some common parameters with reaction–diffusion models (e.g.,

 </sup>). The method developed in this work is computationally very costly. We plan to develop much faster methods, based on deterministic optimization algorithms and analytic descriptions of the gradients of the likelihood. Introducing specific fitness parameters, besides winter decay rate, for the different groups will also help to better understand the effect of interactions between variants on the evolution of viral populations.
