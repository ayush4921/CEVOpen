<p id="Par37">The estimations suggest that three of the four emerging strains have been introduced at approximately the same date, while the fourth one was introduced 5 years later (the model considered only 5-yr intervals of introductions because of constraints on computation time). Despite the neutrality assumption that we made between the emerging strains, we observed different durations of the establishment stage: while ESs 1 and 2 became locally the most prevalent strains only 6 years after their introduction, ES
 <sub>3</sub> displayed delayed dynamics since it became locally the most prevalent strain 11 years after its introduction. In comparison, ES
 <sub>4</sub> was introduced 5 years later than ES
 <sub>3</sub> but became locally the most prevalent strain at about the same date. The low prevalence of the ES
 <sub>3</sub> in the dataset could be explained by a lower fitness of this strain, e.g. higher winter decay rate, lower growth rate or weaker competitivity. Our results indicate that this pattern can also be observed with a neutrality assumption, as a result of the joint effects of the local composition of the landscape, and of the position of the sampling sites, far away from the introduction site. Indeed, in the area where ES
 <sub>4</sub> was first observed, cucurbits crops are very frequent with high connectivity between crops, whereas the area where ES
 <sub>3</sub> was found is patchier. Similarly, our results indicate that the overall prevalence of the CS strain in the study area has been slightly overestimated in the data, due to sampling sites concentrated in the regions where it is indeed the most prevalent strain. The reconstructed dynamics of the five strains therefore underline the importance of estimating jointly the places and dates of the introduction and the other ecological parameters as well as the importance of considering the spatial structure of the sampling design.
