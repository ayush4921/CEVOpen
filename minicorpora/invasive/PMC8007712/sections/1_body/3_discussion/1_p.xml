<p id="Par36">In this work, we developed a reactionâ€“diffusion model to describe the spatial dynamics of invasion of a resident population inhabiting a spatially structured environment by newly introduced variants. Using a mechanistic-statistical framework, we confronted the model to a dataset recording the invasion by several emerging genetic variants of a resident population of WMV and succeeded in (1) estimating the dates and places of successful introduction of each emerging variant as well as parameters related to growth and dispersal, (2) reconstructing the invasion by the new variants from their introduction sites, (3) establishing a competitive advantage of the new variants as compared to the resident population and (4) predicting the fate of each variant. Simulations with the optimal parameter values showed an adequate fit, proving that the model is able to reproduce the observed spatial dynamics despite the strong mechanistic constraints of the model structure and the strong spatial censorship of the dataset, i.e. missing data. We used fraction frequencies in the dataset rather than counting data. We argue that such observations are more robust to heterogeneities in the sampling conditions as they do not require a standardized observation protocol. Similarly, frequency data should be more robust to heterogeneities in the susceptibility among host genotypes, provided that all of the strains are influenced in the same manner. As stated by
