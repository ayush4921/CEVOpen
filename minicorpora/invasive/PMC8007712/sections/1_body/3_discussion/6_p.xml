<p id="Par41">In 2008, the ESs have replaced the CS, which was not anymore the most prevalent strain, whatever the position in the study area, 18 years after the first ESs introduction. Moreover, this competitive advantage of the ESs is expected to lead to the total replacement of the CS by the ESs in about 25 years, i.e. in 2015. These results are consistent with current knowledge: new observations carried out in 2016 and 2017 showed than the classical CS strain is no more detectable

 </sup>. Besides the disappearance of CS strains, the surveys performed in 2016–2017 revealed a complex and dynamic situation that fitted partially with the model. ES
 <sub>3</sub> was detected in only one location in the southwestern part of the study area, confirming its low dispersal and probable low fitness. As predicted by the model, ES
 <sub>1</sub> and ES
 <sub>2</sub> were present in the Eastern part of the area and ES
 <sub>4</sub> was present in all the study area. However, it was found to be more prevalent than ES
 <sub>1</sub> and ES
 <sub>2</sub> even in the Eastern part, suggesting that its fitness is higher than ES
 <sub>1</sub> and ES
 <sub>2</sub>. New variants, not detected in 2004–2008, were also observed in 2016–2017, and some of them presented a high prevalence in all the area. Deep sequencing of two genomic regions revealed, contrary to the 2004–2008 situation
