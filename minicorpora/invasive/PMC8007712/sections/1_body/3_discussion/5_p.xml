 </sup>. We assumed here that emerging strains differed from the resident population only through this parameter. Indeed, no obvious differences in host range, including both cultivated hosts and weeds, have been found between CS and ES strains, whereas ESs strains were found to be better transmitted than CS ones from some weeds infected by both CS and ESs

 </sup>. This could contribute to more efficient transfer from weeds to crops at the beginning of the growing season, leading to a lower winter decay of ESs strains. In our modelling approach we found that ESs strains were able to invade the resident population because of a lower decay during winter. Nevertheless, as all of the other parameters in the model of population dynamics have been set to the same value for the CS and the ESs, all of the competitive advantage of the ESs can be expressed only through the decay rates, explaining these differences, and the unrealistic 0-decay rate of the ESs. The unrealistic null winter decay rate that we found for the ESs suggests that, contrarily to our assumptions, competitive advantage of ESs probably occurs also during summer. Consistently, there is no efficient cross-protection between CS and ESs strains

 </sup> found that superinfection by ESs strains of a plant already infected by CS is easier than the opposite situation. In our model, we also make a neutrality assumption between the ESs that differ only by their introduction dates/sites. This assumption may not completely reflect the complexity of the interactions between viral strains and the biological variability between and within molecular groups

 </sup>. Our model could be extended to consider non-neutral competition between the strains and heterogeneous competitive advantages depending on the host genotype. However, such an approach would bring in a new difficulty in that it would involve a larger number of unknown parameters leading to identifiability issues and underdetermination of the model by the data. As is often the case, there is a trade-off between searching for a more realistic description and models that can be trusted because they still match the data satisfactorily with a small set of parameters to identify.
