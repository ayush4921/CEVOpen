<p id="Par27">Interestingly all the devices remained stable and showed a minimal deterioration in PCE value just about ~0.3% for 100 hours. Subsequently, all the devices were tested after 500 hours, the PCE value of the device-1
 <sup>a</sup> dropped exponentially from ~5.97% to ~4.71% (~20.80% deterioration of PCE) and the device-1
 <sup>b</sup> showed a deterioration value of ~8.68% (from PCE of ~6.37% to ~5.80%), whereas the device-1
 <sup>c</sup> was almost stable and showed a mere drop in its efficiency from ~8.52% to ~8.37% (only ~0.41% deterioration of PCE). Similarly, the stability of the device-1
 <sup>e</sup> was measured for 500 hours and it exhibited a deterioration value of just ~4.10% (PCE of ~8.0%) from its initial original efficiency (~8.36% of PCE) and for the device-1
 <sup>d</sup>, the deterioration of PCE value was found to be ~32.29% (with PCE of 2.16%). Further, the long-term stability of all the devices was examined by exposing the device for 1000 hours. The PCE value of the device-1
 <sup>a</sup> shows a severe decline of up to ~41.38% with PCE of ~3.53%, J
 <sub>SC</sub> of ~18.93 mA/cm
 <sup>2</sup>, V
 <sub>OC</sub> of ~0.496 V and FF of ~37.87%. The device-1
 <sup>b</sup> displays average long-term stability with reduction in PCE value to ~4.34% having J
 <sub>SC</sub> of ~19.81 mA/cm
 <sup>2</sup>, V
 <sub>OC</sub> of ~0.519 V and FF of ~42.22% from its initial efficiency of ~6.37% (~31.88% of reduction in PCE). The device-1
 <sup>c</sup> showed substantial and long-term stability up to 1000 hours compared to that of the other devices-1
 <sup>a,b,d–f</sup>, retaining its deterioration value to less than ~5.57% with a PCE of ~8.05% from its original efficiency (~8.52%). In this case, there is a slight decrease in all the key parameters (J
 <sub>SC</sub> ~23.29 mA/cm
 <sup>2</sup>, V
 <sub>OC</sub> ~0.645 V and FF ~53.61%). The results observed in the previous reports state that the degree of graphitization of the graphitic carbon determines the long-term stability for the carbon based HTMs in perovskite solar cells

 </sup>. Similar results were observed in the present work which shows that the prepared EC-GC10 graphitic carbon device showed a high degree of graphitization compared to the other (EC-GC4 &lt; EC-GC8 &lt; EC-GC10) devices and hence exhibited more stability against air and moisture (device-1
 <sup>a</sup> &lt; device-1
 <sup>b</sup> &lt; device-1
 <sup>c</sup>). The comparative device-1
 <sup>e</sup> constructed using ‘CC’ as HTM, upholds its stability by more than ~80% (degraded from PCE of ~8.35% to ~6.73%) for 1000 hours. Whereas, the stability of the device-1
 <sup>d</sup> fabricated using C/NiS composite deteriorated to ~50% after 1000 hrs (~1.60% PCE) from its original PCE of ~3.19% which showed a faster deterioration rate than all the other devices and this may be attributed to the highly unstable behaviour of nickel sulphide to the ambient environment. From the stability tests, it is clear that the bio extracted porous graphitic carbon annealed at 1000 °C (EC-GC10) fabricated PSCs showed better stability performance, upholding the PCE value up to 94% of the initial PCE even after 1000 hrs compared to all the fabricated devices.
