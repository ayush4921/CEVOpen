<p id="Par12">The specific surface area and the corresponding porosity of the bio-prepared graphitic carbon were investigated using N
 <sub>2</sub> adsorption/desorption isotherms and BJH analysis and are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4(a–f)</xref>. The relevant parameters extracted from the isotherms are given in Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>, along with a comparison with some previous reports on the surface area, pore size and volume of graphitic carbon extracted from various bio-waste materials. The sample (EC-GC4) annealed at ~450 °C shows a type IV isotherm with the hysteresis loop of H2

 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4(d)</xref>, the average pore size and volume have been calculated and are found to be 77.3 nm and 0.29 cm

 </sup>. Whereas the isotherm of EC-GC8 shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4(b)</xref> is a characteristic of a typical mesoporous-like material, which is confirmed by the type IV plateau with an H3 hysteresis loop

 </sup>. In this, we could observe a higher surface area of 329.99 m

 <sup>3</sup>g
 <sup>−1</sup> respectively

 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4(e)</xref>). The BET analysis of the porous graphitic carbon sample annealed at ~1000 °C (EC-GC10) shows type II isotherm in H4 loop with enhanced surface area (1000.45 m
 <sup>2</sup>g
 <sup>−1</sup>) and mesoporous nature with the presence of narrow slit-like pores (pore size of 19.9 nm and pore volume of 0.23 cm

 </sup>. The BJH pore size distribution with mesoporous nature and high specific surface area of the sample EC-GC10 demonstrates that the thermal reduction with loss of oxygen functional group has created more porosity when compared to that of the other two samples and this may be due to high-temperature annealing

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>
 </sup>. The above-obtained BET reports suggest that the sample having a high specific surface area with mesoporous nature may play a significant role and can also afford ideal pathways that will improve current density in PSC device
