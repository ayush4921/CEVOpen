<p id="Par10">The morphology of the bio-prepared porous graphitic carbon annealed at different temperatures (~450 °C, ~850 °C and ~1000 °C) has been investigated using FESEM analysis. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3(a)</xref> shows the formation of an aggregated and bulky graphitic carbon for the ~450 °C annealed sample and this may be due to the presence of unreacted residuals of the

 </sup>. The increase in the graphitization temperature to ~850 °C, shows the formation of a fibrous structure with improved porosity and a decrease in the particle size of the graphitic carbon which is due to the evaporation of moisture content in the bio-char and this is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3(b)</xref>. When the annealing temperature increases to ~1000 °C, the fibrous structured samples apparently modify into a thin layer of flake like structured graphitic carbon as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3(c)</xref>. This is expected, because the purpose of using higher annealing temperature is not only for the removal of the unwanted impurities but also to improve the porosity in the EC-GC materials, and this is also observed in the nitrogen sorption analysis. The obtained morphology of EC-GC10 may be helpful in rapid charge transport and could improve the stability and PCE in PSCs.
