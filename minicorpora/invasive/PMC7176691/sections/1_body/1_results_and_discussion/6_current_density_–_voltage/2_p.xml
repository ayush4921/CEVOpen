 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> summarizes all the corresponding key photovoltaic parameters (J

 <sub>OC,</sub> and FF) extracted from the J-V curves, The results demonstrate that the device constructed using EC-GC10 has a high PCE of 8.52% with a short current density (J
 <sub>SC</sub>) of 23.49 mA/cm
 <sup>2</sup>, an open-circuit voltage (V
 <sub>OC</sub>) of 0.672 V and a fill factor (FF) of 54.03%. Whereas the other two devices fabricated using EC-GC4 and EC-GC8 (device-1

 <sub>OC</sub> of the perovskite devices (0.631 V, 0.620 V, and 0.672 V) constructed using different EC-GC materials almost remains unchanged but there is a change in the current density values. In fact, the role of annealing temperature greatly influences the hexagonal graphitic phases and the porosity of the as-prepared carbon materials and this may be the reason behind the enhancement of J
 <sub>SC</sub> (22.01 mA/cm

 <sup>2</sup>, and 23.49 mA/cm
 <sup>2</sup>) and FF (43.01%, 46.80%, and 54.03%) of the perovskite devices. The better device performance of the EC-GC10 based device can be directly ascribed to the larger surface area (1000.45 m
