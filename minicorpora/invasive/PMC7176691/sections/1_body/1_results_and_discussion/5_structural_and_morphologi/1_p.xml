 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5(a,b)</xref>. Though the mixed halide perovskite resulted in achieving improved device efficiency, its poor stability and degradation phenomena under the ambient environment have been a tailback for the commercial development of long-term stability PSCs

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>
 </sup>, several remedial measures have been reported which can make the perovskite structure to withstand under ambient conditions

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>
 </sup> and some of them are like incorporation and post-treatment of perovskite material using inorganic compounds

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>
 </sup>, composition engineering using mixed anions and cations
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>
 </sup> and also by introducing carbon-based materials
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>
 </sup>. Hence in the present study, an attempt has been made to overcome the above-mentioned drawbacks by encapsulating the perovskite material using carbon-based materials which could be used as an interfacial layer sandwiched between the active absorber and as prepared graphitic carbon counter electrode.
