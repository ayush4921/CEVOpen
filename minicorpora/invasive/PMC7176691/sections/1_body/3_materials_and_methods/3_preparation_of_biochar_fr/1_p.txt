0: The biochar from the invasive plant was prepared using the ancient Indian oil lamp heating method.
1: In this, the stems and leaves of the  Eichhornia crassipes (EC) plants were taken as the precursors for the preparation of biochar.
2: Then the ECs plant parts were chopped into tiny pieces and were washed with deionized water and ethanol at 60  2 C to remove all the unwanted impurities.
3: Then the cleaned ECs were dried under shadow for 2 days and then dried in direct sunlight for 12 hours and further, the ECs pieces were heated overnight using the ancient Indian oil lamp method.
4: In this low-temperature carbonization process, the invasive ECs have been converted into black colored biochar which could be used further for the extraction of porous graphitic carbon materials.
