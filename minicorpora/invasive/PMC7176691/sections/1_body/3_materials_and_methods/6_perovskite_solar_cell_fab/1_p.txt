0: Commercially available fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conductive glass substrates (surface resistivity of 10 /square) were cleaned by ultrasonication in acetone, methanol and then in isopropanol sequentially for 10 minutes at 80  2 C and finally dried using nitrogen airflow.
1: An electron transporting compact (c-TiO 2) layer solution was prepared by mixing 700 L of titanium di isopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) in 7.0 mL of absolute ethanol (1:10 volume ratio) and was filtered through 0.2 m pore syringe filter.
2: This solution (1200 l of above solution for 6 samples) was sprayed on the preheated glass/FTO surface followed by annealing at 450  5 C for 10 minutes.
3: It was then allowed to cool down to room temperature (RT) and sonicated in absolute ethanol for 20 minutes.
4: The purchased dyesol 18 NR TiO 2 paste mixed with absolute ethanol (1:3.5 volume ratio) solution and was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 20 s to form a mesoporous TiO 2 (mp-TiO 2) on the top of the c-TiO 2 layer.
5: It was then annealed at 450  5 C for 30 minutes.
6: The overnight heated perovskite solution at 70  2 C was taken and spin-coated on the top of the pre-heated (80  2 C) glass/FTO/c-TiO 2/mp-TiO 2 film at 2000 rpm for the 30 s. The deposited perovskite film was heated at 120  3 C for 45 minutes so as to remove the organic solvents and this resulted in a systematic color change in the layer from yellow to black confirming the formation of perovskite active layer.
7: A heterogenous graphitic carbon (EC-GC10) mixed perovskite solution was taken and spin-coated at 3500/1500 rpm for 20 s and was heated at 80  2 C, and this resulted in the formation of porous graphitic carbon encapsulated perovskite (EC-GC10@CH 3NH 3PbI 3xCl x) thin film with the thickness of 80/150 nm respectively.
8: Finally, the carbon-based hole transporting material (C-HTMs) such as EC-GC4, EC-GC8, EC-GC10, commercial carbon paste (CC) and carbon nickel sulphide composite (C/NiS) was mixed with -terpineol and chlorobenzene (1:2 vol.%) and coated via brush painting technique on the top of the perovskite layer.
9: The PSC device structure fabricated in the present work are of the form Glass/FTO/c-TiO 2/mp-TiO 2/CH 3NH 3PbI 3xCl x/EC-GC10@CH 3NH 3PbI 3xCl x/EC-GC based HTMs prepared at different annealed temperatures.
