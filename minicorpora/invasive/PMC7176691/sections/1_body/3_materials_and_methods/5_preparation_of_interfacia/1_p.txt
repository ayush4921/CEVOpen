0: For the preparation of mixed halide perovskite solution, methylammonium iodide (CH 3NH 3I) was synthesized according to our previously reported work 87.
1: From this, 349.7 mg of CH 3NH 3I was taken and dissolved in 1 ml of dimethylformamide (DMF).
2: Then 0.203 mg of lead (II) chloride (PbCl 2) was slowly added and the mixture was stirred and heated at 90  2 C for 2 hours and the obtained final mixed halide perovskite (CH 3NH 3PbI 3xCl x) solution was filtered through a 0.2 m syringe filter.
3: Further, the CH 3NH 3PbI 3xCl x solution was stirred vigorously with 0.001 g of EC-GC10 porous graphitic carbon sample dissolved in chlorobenzene and was ultrasonicated for 10 minutes.
4: The obtained final heterogeneous mixture solution was kept for further process to be used as an interfacial layer of PSCs.
