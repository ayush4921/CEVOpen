0: The crystalline structure of the prepared samples was analyzed using an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker D8 ADVANCE ECO).
1: Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum in the range of 4000500 cm 1 has been recorded using the Bruker FTIR spectrometer.
2: Jasco V-670 was used to record the UV-Visible absorption spectra.
3: Perkin Elmer LS 45 was used to record the photoluminescence (PL) studies.
4: The morphology and the microstructure of the samples were recorded using Zeiss, Sigma, UK (Field-emission scanning electron microscope) and JEOL JEM 2100 (High-resolution transmission electron microscope) instruments.
5: ESCA2000 of VG micro-tech, UK was used to record X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra .
6: BET analysis was carried out using ASAP 2020 micromeritics.
7: Renishaw, UK, Model: Invia was used to perform micro Raman spectroscopy studies.
8: The current density-voltage (J-V) measurements were carried out using Keithley 2420 source meter under 1 Sun illumination with AM 1.5 G filter from Newport, ORIEL Solar Simulator 88.
9: The J-V scan was made from V OC 1.5 to +1.5 V with a time delay at 30 ms with a step size of 10 mV and a scan rate of 50 mV/s 87.
10: At least three sets were taken for observing photovoltaic behavior such as current density-voltage (J-V) and the device stability for 1000 hours at 25  5 C at 70  5% humidity.
11: A black mask of 0.314 sq.cm as an active area was used on top of the cell to avoid the overestimation of current density when excess light falls on the device outside the active area.
