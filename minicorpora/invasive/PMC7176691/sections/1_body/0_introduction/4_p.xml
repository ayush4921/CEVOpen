<p id="Par5">To our knowledge, this is the first report on the preparation of a low-cost porous graphitic carbon extracted from an invasive plant species for the sustainable fabrication of hole transport material/counter electrode for efficient enhancement of air and moisture stability in PSCs. Also, the graphitization nature of the prepared carbon has been found to be improved for the three different annealing temperatures (~450 °C, ~850 °C and ~1000 °C). Correspondingly, a graphitic carbon encapsulated perovskite (EC-GC10@CH
 <sub>3</sub>NH
 <sub>3</sub>PbI
 <sub>3−x</sub>Cl
 <sub>x</sub>) interfacial layer has been introduced between the perovskite/carbon-HTM junction (prepared by mixing the extracted graphitic carbon (I
 <sub>D</sub>/I
 <sub>G</sub> = 0.75) having a high surface area of 1000.452 m
 <sup>2</sup>/g into the perovskite solution). Finally, the three different annealed porous graphitic carbon HTM/electrode has been deposited using a facile brush painting technique for the fabrication of PSC device with structure: FTO/c-TiO
