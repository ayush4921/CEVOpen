0: With all the above previous reports, the present study focuses to enhance the air and moisture stability of the carbon based PSCs at low-cost for the onsite photovoltaic application.
1: Herein, we have demonstrated the facile preparation of graphitic carbon from an invasive waste plant ( Eichhornia Crassipes) which can be effectively used as an efficient hole transporter/back electrode  a dual role in PSCs.
2: In general,  Eichhornia Crassipes (Family: Pontederiaceae) commonly called water hyacinth is an aquatic weed that can easily spread and interfere in an ecosystem by posing a serious threat to the native biodiversity, leading to economic loss worldwide.
3: Moreover, the influence of this plant on freshwater results in a waning of oxygen level which leads to the death of huge aquatic plants and animals.
4: Furthermore, it also results in a drop in temperature, pH value, and nutrient levels.
5: In fact, this  Eichhornia Crassipes plant has been included by the world conservation union (IUCN) in the list of 100 most dangerous invasive species 33.
