0: To our knowledge, this is the first report on the preparation of a low-cost porous graphitic carbon extracted from an invasive plant species for the sustainable fabrication of hole transport material/counter electrode for efficient enhancement of air and moisture stability in PSCs.
1: Also, the graphitization nature of the prepared carbon has been found to be improved for the three different annealing temperatures (~450 C, ~850 C and ~1000 C).
2: Correspondingly, a graphitic carbon encapsulated perovskite (EC-GC10@CH 3NH 3PbI 3xCl x) interfacial layer has been introduced between the perovskite/carbon-HTM junction (prepared by mixing the extracted graphitic carbon (I D/I G = 0.75) having a high surface area of 1000.452 m 2/g into the perovskite solution).
3: Finally, the three different annealed porous graphitic carbon HTM/electrode has been deposited using a facile brush painting technique for the fabrication of PSC device with structure: FTO/c-TiO 2/mp-TiO 2/CH 3NH 3PbI 3xCl x/EC-GC10@CH 3NH 3PbI 3xCl x/EC-GC4/8/10.
