<p id="Par3">As to overcome such practical issues, replacing the unstable HTMs and the expensive back contacts with a low-cost alternative material would result in bringing down the overall cost of the PSC devices and also improve their performance

 </sup>. Hence, recent researchers found that this instability issue within the PSC devices could be tackled readily by the use of inorganic HTMs, yet the cell performance with an inorganic HTM layer is typically substandard to the one with an organic HTM

 </sup>. This paved the way to introduce a promising low-cost and earth-abundant carbon as an effective replacer for the unstable HTMs and expensive electrodes, as it can play the dual role as hole transporter and as an electrode

 </sup>. Also, the carbon materials have an optimal work function value of about −5.0 eV to −5.1 eV which is equal to that of the gold electrode which makes it a promising replacement for achieving improved photovoltaic performance and better air and moisture stability

 </sup>. With this, recent researchers have focused to fabricate PSCs using different forms of carbonaceous materials such as graphene, reduced-graphene oxide (rGO), graphdiyne and carbon having different structures of carbons such as nanotubes (SWCNTs &amp; MWCNTs), fullerenes, C

 </sup>. However, the use of carbon based HTMs in PSC fails to achieve superior charge transportation. Hence, it is an important aspect to facilitate charge extraction property which can be achieved by introducing suitable device architecture and by making necessary interface engineering which could play a crucial role in further enhancement of the device stability and efficiency of carbon based PSCs
