<p id="Par15">The native honey bee, 
 <italic>Apis cerana</italic>, was the primary pollinator of pumpkin flowers (92% of the total sample). In 8% of the flowers, another native bee species, 
 <italic>Apis dorsata</italic>, also visited the flowers along with 
 <italic>A. cerana</italic>. Since 
 <italic>A. dorsata</italic> was a minority, we used pooled data of visitation characteristics of both the species in the analyses after realizing that the response of both the species of bees was the same towards the ants.
