<p id="Par14">The pistillate flowers produced an average of 5.2 μL (± 0.09) nectar and the staminate flowers produced an average of 2.8 μL (± 0.08) nectar immediately following the anthesis, which continued and maintained through the entire anthesis period. In non-harvested flowers, the accumulated nectar volume can go up to about 40 μL in pistillate flowers and 28 μL in staminate flowers (Sinu, personal observation). The quality of nectar produced by staminate flowers averaged 29.4% (± 1.05) sugar concentration by weight and 31.1% (± 2%) in pistillate flowers.</p>
