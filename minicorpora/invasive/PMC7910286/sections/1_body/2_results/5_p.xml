<p id="Par18">The pollinators preferred to visit ant-unoccupied flowers (75%) over ant-occupied flowers (62%; 1.94 ± 0.6, z = 3.25, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001). The visitation rate of pollinators on ant-unoccupied flowers (4.14 ± 5.6) was significantly higher than on the ant-occupied flowers (2.4 ± 3.08; 0.50 ± 0.09, z = 5.35, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.00005) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). On ant flowers, the visitation rate of pollinators to the native ants- (2.43 ± 2.29) and invasive ants-occupied flowers (2.38 ± 3.34) was same (0.41 ± 0.25, z = 1.62, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.10), but decreased on native ants-occupied flowers when their numbers increased on the flowers (− 0.11 ± 0.04, z = − 2.41, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.01). However, the visitation rate of pollinators to the flowers varied with the ant species occupied on the flowers (Wald’s χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 18.75, df = 4, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0008) (Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The pollinator visits also decreased with the number of ants occupied on flowers (− 0.04 ± 0.003, z = − 4.87, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.00005). The response (visitation rate) of pollinators to the number of ants and ant type was not driven by flower sex (three-way interaction model: Wald’s χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.93, df = 1, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.33). It suggests that the pollinators, despite preferred pistillate flowers for foraging, absconded when the number of ants, though belonging to the native species group, was high on flowers (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).
