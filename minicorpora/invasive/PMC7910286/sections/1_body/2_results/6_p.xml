<p id="Par19">On ant-unoccupied flowers, the pollinators spent more time on pistillate flowers (96 ± 99 s/visit) than on staminate flowers (79 ± 89 s/visit; 0.14 ± 0.01, z = 7.16, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.00005). The pollinators spent more time on ant-unoccupied flowers (85.02 ± 93.42 s/ visit) than on ant-occupied flowers for foraging (72.8 ± 58.3 s/ visits; 0.13 ± 0.06, z = 1.98, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.04). On ant flowers, the foraging time of pollinators a) decreased with the number of ants on flowers (− 0.02 ± 0.002, z = − 6.39, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.00005), b) not affected by the nativity of ant species (0.22 ± 0.13, z = 1.77, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.07; 80.5 ± 54.4 s/visit for native ants- and 69.4 ± 59.6 s/ visit for invasive ants-occupied flowers), c) but decreased on native ants-occupied flowers when their numbers increased on them (− 0.09 ± 0.03, z = − 2.79, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). The three-way interaction by the number of ants, ant type (native vs. invasive), and flower sex predicted the foraging duration of pollinators on flowers. (Table
