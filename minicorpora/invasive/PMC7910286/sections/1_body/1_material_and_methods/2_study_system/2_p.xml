<p id="Par10">A large ovary at the flower base and three stigma lobes inside the flower distinguishes the pistillate flower from the staminate flower. The staminate flower has its anthers united into a single long filament of about 10 cm. The pollen grains are large and sticky; thus, pollination is dependent on the animal pollinator. Flower longevity is one day. The flower opened between 0630 and 0700 h and remained open for about 6 h. Native honey bee,

 </sup>. Farmers raised plants from the seeds collected from their previous years, with "Ambili" being the predominant variety in field populations. Four to six seeds were sowed in a pit of about 60 cm diameter and 30–45 cm depth, mixing it with neem cake and cow dung. The field is irrigated daily morning using the traditional pot method or water hose
