0: A large ovary at the flower base and three stigma lobes inside the flower distinguishes the pistillate flower from the staminate flower.
1: The staminate flower has its anthers united into a single long filament of about 10 cm.
2: The pollen grains are large and sticky; thus, pollination is dependent on the animal pollinator.
3: Flower longevity is one day.
4: The flower opened between 0630 and 0700 h and remained open for about 6 h. Native honey bee,  Apis cerana, is the primary pollinator of  C. maxima in our study area 37.
5: Farmers raised plants from the seeds collected from their previous years, with "Ambili" being the predominant variety in field populations.
6: Four to six seeds were sowed in a pit of about 60 cm diameter and 3045 cm depth, mixing it with neem cake and cow dung.
7: The field is irrigated daily morning using the traditional pot method or water hose 38.
