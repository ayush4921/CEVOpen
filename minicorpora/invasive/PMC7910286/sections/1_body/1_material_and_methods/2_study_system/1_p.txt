0: We took pumpkin ( Cucurbita maxima) as our study system.
1: It is a monoecious plant with separate staminate (male) and pistillate (female) flowers.
2: Both flowers are borne on different nodes with a disproportionately high number of staminate flowers per field 37.
3: The staminate and pistillate flowers are large, showy yellow with abundant floral nectarthe pistillate flowers producing a slightly higher quantity of quality nectar 38.
4: We harvested nectar from pre-caged staminate (N = 14; 2 per site) and pistillate flowers (N = 14; 2 per site) soon after anthesis using Drummond micro-capillary tubes (10 L) and estimated the sugar concentration using a hand-held refractometer.
