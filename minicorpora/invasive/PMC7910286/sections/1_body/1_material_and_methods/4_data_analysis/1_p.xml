<p id="Par12">First, we examined the preference of pollinators and ants to flower sexes for foraging resources. The visitation rate of pollinators on ant-unoccupied staminate and pistillate flowers was compared to understand pollinators' general preference for flowers for foraging floral resources using a Generalized Linear Mixed Effect Model (GLMM). In the model, pollinators' visitation rate was fitted as the dependent variable, flower sex was fitted as the fixed variable, flower ID nested in plant ID and sites was fitted as a random factor, and negative binomial distribution as an error type. The overall ants' abundance on staminate and pistillate flowers was compared using another GLMM. We repeated this for native ants and invasive ants, separately. In the models, respective ants' abundance was fitted as response variable, flower type as fixed effect, flower ID nested in plant ID and sites as random factors and negative binomial distribution as the error type.</p>
