<p id="Par11">Our study's observations were carried out from 28th December 2018 to 15th February 2019, at the peak season of pumpkin flowering. During the study days (44 days), the data on ant visits and pollinator visits were collected from 0700 to 0800 h. We counted a total of 1664 flowers from all seven sites together to record the number of pistillate and staminate flowers. From this, we studied the pollinator and ant activity on 348 randomly chosen flowers (206 ant-occupied flowers (93 staminate and 113 pistillate flowers) and 142 ant-unoccupied flowers (33 pistillate and 109 staminate flowers)) belong to 102 plants (14.57 ± 21 plants/site). To observe pollinator and ant activity, we spent 15 min per flower during the early hours of the anthesis and pollinators' peak activity (0700–0800 h). We observed the flowers in which ants were present and the flowers in which ants were absent in the fields. During this observation window, we assessed the visitation rate, the duration of the visit, and pollinators’ hovering activity. We observed the visitation rate as the number of times the pollinator entered the flower. We recorded the time of entry and exit of a pollinator, the duration the pollinator spent inside the flower in a single visit. This time was recorded using a stopwatch. In cases, when a large number of ants colonised the flower, the pollinators did not enter the reproductive part of the flower; the pollinator rather hovered around the flower or landed on the tip of petals for very less time (&lt; 3 s). Such an activity of the pollinators was recorded as 'hovering' and not as a visit. In flowers occupied by ants, we collected the ants in 5 mL vials with ethanol and identified them later from the lab. Based on the identification and the invasive ant list
