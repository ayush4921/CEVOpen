0: Our study's observations were carried out from 28th December 2018 to 15th February 2019, at the peak season of pumpkin flowering.
1: During the study days (44 days), the data on ant visits and pollinator visits were collected from 0700 to 0800 h. We counted a total of 1664 flowers from all seven sites together to record the number of pistillate and staminate flowers.
2: From this, we studied the pollinator and ant activity on 348 randomly chosen flowers (206 ant-occupied flowers (93 staminate and 113 pistillate flowers) and 142 ant-unoccupied flowers (33 pistillate and 109 staminate flowers)) belong to 102 plants (14.57  21 plants/site).
3: To observe pollinator and ant activity, we spent 15 min per flower during the early hours of the anthesis and pollinators' peak activity (07000800 h).
4: We observed the flowers in which ants were present and the flowers in which ants were absent in the fields.
5: During this observation window, we assessed the visitation rate, the duration of the visit, and pollinators hovering activity.
6: We observed the visitation rate as the number of times the pollinator entered the flower.
7: We recorded the time of entry and exit of a pollinator, the duration the pollinator spent inside the flower in a single visit.
8: This time was recorded using a stopwatch.
9: In cases, when a large number of ants colonised the flower, the pollinators did not enter the reproductive part of the flower; the pollinator rather hovered around the flower or landed on the tip of petals for very less time (< 3 s).
10: Such an activity of the pollinators was recorded as 'hovering' and not as a visit.
11: In flowers occupied by ants, we collected the ants in 5 mL vials with ethanol and identified them later from the lab.
12: Based on the identification and the invasive ant list 39, we grouped ant-occupied flowers into native ant flowers and invasive ant flowers.
13: We also counted the number of ants occupied  a single flower.
14: Whenever the ant colony was too large in number, the flowers were cut open to facilitate counting the ant individuals.
