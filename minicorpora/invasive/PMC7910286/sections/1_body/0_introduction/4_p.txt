0: Among ants, the invasive ants have been particularly demonstrated to have a disruptive effect on plant-pollinator mutualism 20,  23,  24,  29  33.
1: Invasive ants, because aggressive and competent in locating carbohydrate-rich sources in a short period, can occupy more flowers in more numbers, which can significantly reduce diversity, frequency, and foraging time of legitimate pollinators on flowers 12,  34  36.
2: While most of the nectar-thieving ants primarily engaged in foraging floral nectar, a few also have attempted to prey upon pollinators 18,  20,  27  29.
3: Although some studies suggest that the invasive ants protect some plants against herbivores, it is likely that their aggressiveness wards off some useful mutualists, too 29,  35.
4: Although a few studies examined the effect of invasive ants on pollinators, a comparative study between native and invasive ants has not been done yet 12.
5: In this study, we have attempted to compare the effects of ants on pollinators and compare the competition exerted by non-native and native ants on the pollinators of  Cucurbita maximaa monoecious globally-important, pollination-deficient crop plant.
