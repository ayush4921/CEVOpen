1: Plants in over 100 families use extra-floral nectaries for defending ants on flowers 16.
2: However, growing evidence shows that ants are also exploring flowers of a range of flowering plants, and giving differential impacts to pollinators, pollination, and plant reproduction 17  26.
3: Nevertheless, ants are mainly regarded as floral nectar thieves and disruptors of plant-pollinator mutualism 19,  20,  27  31.
