0: To understand the effects of ants on pollinators, we took three attributes of pollinators and observed how these were affected by flower-visiting ants (hereafter, floral ants).
1: They were the pollinators choice to visit or not to visit the flowers, the frequency of pollinators' visits (visitation rate), and the time the pollinators spent inside the flowers.
2: We expected the visitation rate and visit duration of pollinators to be negatively affected by ants' presence.
3: Since invasive ants are known for displacing biodiversity and interrupting species interactions, we hypothesize that the invasive ants exert more pressure on plant-pollinator interaction than the native ants do.
4: We considered the ant's ability to occupy the maximum number of flowers and maximize the number of individuals occupying a single flower as the parameters for assessing ants' exploitation competition on pollinators.
5: Our expectation for this was that the flowers occupied by invasive ants in the population are higher than the flowers occupied by native ants.
6: Since the plant in our study is monoecious, we also asked whether the ant-pollinator interaction was affected by flower sex.
