 </sup> defined interference and exploitation competition in the context of floral ants and pollinators. Exploitation competition is considered dependent on how much a competitor can access and utilize a resource. In our case, we thought the ant's ability to occupy the maximum number of flowers and crowding a single flower as the parameters for assessing the exploitation competition. Interference competition is the efficiency with which one competitor ward off the other.
