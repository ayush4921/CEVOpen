<p id="Par28">Our study further confirms the adverse effects the ants have on pollinators. However, such a generalization is challenging as the interactions between ants, plants, other herbivores, and pollinators are quite complicated

 </sup> showed that the native ants on flowers defend inefficient pollinators, but unaffected the visits of efficient pollinators. Unlike many previous studies, we compared the competition given by invasive ants and native ants on the pollinators. The invasive ants do most of the exploitive competition as they have their supercolonies and huge population to their advantage. However, we found that any ant—invasive or native—can exhibit interference competition by being aggressive and preying upon the pollinators. But it is not possible to draw a fine border between these two competitions. Information on the effects of ants on pollinators will help manage pollinators in agricultural lands
