<p id="Par22">With its showy flowers with a reasonable amount of floral rewards in the form of both pollen and nectar, pumpkin is a noteworthy lure for both ants and bees. We found that ants occupied more than 75% of the flowers during the early hours of anthesis in different fields. The ratio of staminate flowers to pistillate flowers counted in our study agrees that the number of staminate flowers is mostly higher in a field

They even tended to be crowded on pistillate flowers than on staminate flowers. The relatively good amount of nectar in pistillate flowers might be explaining the differential level of attraction of ants to flower sexes.
