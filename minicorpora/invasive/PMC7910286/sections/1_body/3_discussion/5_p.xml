 </sup>. Our study found that the pollinator entry was significantly lower in the ant-occupied flowers. We also observed several hovering cases, wherein the bee hovered around the flowers or landed on petals but flew off. In such cases, the bees avoided contact with ants and did not touch the flower's reproductive structures, which may be a massive loss for the plant as pollination is likely to be directly affected. The pollination efficiency was also significantly lowered in ant-occupied flowers

 </sup>, we found the native ant, 
 <italic>Diacamma ceylonense</italic> was opportunistically preying upon honey bees in the present study (pers. observ.). The duration of pollinators’ visit was also significantly higher in ant-unoccupied flowers over ant-occupied flowers. This indicates direct interference competition that ants offer to the pollinators.
