<p id="Par27">The efficiency with which ants used up resources determined the exploitation competition given by ants to the pollinators

 </sup>. The main parameters of the ants that we used to measure this were the number of individuals that occupy a single flower and the number of flowers occupied by a single species of ant. 
 <italic>Solenopsis geminata</italic> was found with the highest number of individuals per single flower. Although not particularly common for 
 <italic>S. geminata,</italic> the mass recruitment is a key character of invasive ants
 <sup>

 </sup>. Similarly, in general, invasive ants had a higher number of individuals recruited to a single flower than the native ants. The black crazy ant, 
 <italic>P. longicornis</italic> occupied the highest number of flowers. This implies that they are highly efficient in locating resources. 
 <italic>P. longicornis</italic> has a complicated modular recruitment system and polydymous nesting

 </sup>. This minimizes the distance between the nest and food resource and increases their foraging efficiency. The other globally-important invasive species colonized in pumpkin flowers
 <italic>, A. gracilipes</italic>, is also known to make supercolonies and exploit resources quickly

 </sup>. Thus, invasive ants exerted a higher exploitation competition on pollinators than native ants. Both the visitation frequency and the duration of visits decreased with the increasing number of ants. Therefore, even a native ant, when recruited in more numbers to the flowers, can also influence the pollinators' visitation attributes. The interference competition given by invasive and native ants seemed to be similar. Bees seemed not particularly showed any discretion between the scents of an invasive ant occupied and native ant occupied flower.
