<p id="Par21">In this study, we attempted to explore the effects of ants on pollinators and compare these effects in cases of invasive and native ants. The study found that ants, regardless of their nativity, gave a competitive pressure for honeybees—the sole pollinators—in pumpkin flowers. The visitation rate and the duration they spent foraging floral resources were significantly low for ant-occupied flowers. Although the bees tend to spend more time on native-ant-occupied flowers, when the number of ants is high, avoid such flowers.</p>
