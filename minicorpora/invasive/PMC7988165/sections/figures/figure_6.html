 <caption> Results of leaf trichome density: ( A) number of trichomes on leaves for mowed and unmowed treatments (Y-axis) ((Two sample T-test; t = − 2.53; P-value = 0.02), ( B) compares mean number trichomes on abaxial and adaxial side of the leaf for both mowed (Y-axis) (Two-way Anova; F = 1.27; P-value = 0.26) and unmowed (Y-axis) (Two-way Anova; F = 3.50; P-value = 0.06) treatments respectively, ( C) mean number of stellate trichomes on leaves for mowed and unmowed treatments (Y-axis) (Two sample T-test; t = − 2.47; P-value &gt; 0.02), ( D) mean number of glandular trichomes on leaves for mowed and unmowed treatments (Y-axis) (Two sample T-test; t =  − 0.10; P-value = 0.918), ( E) number of spikes on stellate trichomes for mowed and unmowed treatments (Y-axis) (Two sample T-test; t = − 6.26; P-value &lt; 0.00). Means are shown by scale bars and asterisk denotes significantly different results at P  &lt; 0.05, while ns denotes non-significant results. </caption>
