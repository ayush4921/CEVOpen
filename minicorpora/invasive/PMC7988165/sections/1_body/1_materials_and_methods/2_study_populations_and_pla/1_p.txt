0: For all the experiments detailed in this study, we used plants and seeds derived from 8 locations in the McAllen-Edinburg area of Rio Grande Valley, Texas, USA where SLN is native.
1: We had been monitoring these locations in the McAllen-Edinburg city limits for over three years 56 and have confirmed the disturbance status of these populations; mowing has been done by city management continuously and 4 out of eight populations were disturbed by continuous mowing by the city management, and the rest were left undisturbed, but within 2030 m from each other.
2: The GPS coordinates and population size of these locations have been detailed in Supplementary Table  1.
