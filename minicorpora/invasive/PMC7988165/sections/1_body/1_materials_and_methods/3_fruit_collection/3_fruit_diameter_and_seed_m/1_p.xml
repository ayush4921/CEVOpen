<p id="Par13">To measure fruit diameter and seed mass, five random fruits from the pooled fruits of a single genet (individual plant in each sub population/treatment i.e., from each location of mowed and unmowed areas) were chosen. Fruit diameter was measured using a digital caliper (ABSOLUTE Super Caliper SERIES 500, IL, USA). Afterwards, the fruits were carefully cut in halves without causing any damage to seed. The fruit’s pulp was removed, and the seeds were separated using a fine mesh strainer and then were dried on a napkin for at least 12 h. Once dried, the seeds were counted and stored in falcon tubes at 70 °C and 50% relative humidity.</p>
