0: To create a seed bank from each location (each field area of mowed and unmowed plants) for germination experiment and mass measurement, 200 seeds were randomly chosen from the pooled seeds of all the fruits from each genet per location.
1: 100 of these seeds from both treatments (mowed and unmowed) from each of the eight locations were then weighed using an analytical balance (Accuris Dx W3101A-220, Mid Sci, MO, USA) to get 100 seed mass.
