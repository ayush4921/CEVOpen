0: To measure fruit diameter and seed mass, five random fruits from the pooled fruits of a single genet (individual plant in each sub population/treatment i.e., from each location of mowed and unmowed areas) were chosen.
1: Fruit diameter was measured using a digital caliper (ABSOLUTE Super Caliper SERIES 500, IL, USA).
2: Afterwards, the fruits were carefully cut in halves without causing any damage to seed.
3: The fruits pulp was removed, and the seeds were separated using a fine mesh strainer and then were dried on a napkin for at least 12 h. Once dried, the seeds were counted and stored in falcon tubes at 70 C and 50% relative humidity.
