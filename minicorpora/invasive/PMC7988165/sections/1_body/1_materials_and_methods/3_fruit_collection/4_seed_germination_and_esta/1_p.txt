0: To examine seed germination and seedling establishment, 200 seeds from each of the pooled seed banks (from all eight locations) were used (1600 seeds in total; 800 per treatment).
1: Before sowing, half of the seeds (400 each from each treatment) were treated with 20 ml of gibberellic acid in deionized water (mowed/unmowed) (GA 3, 1000 ppm; Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) for 24 h to examine whether treatment  seed germination is impacted by the rooting hormone 57.
2: After the seed treatment, 50 seeds each were sown each in a plastic tray (7.5 in  12.5 in  2 in) using a sterilized potting mixture (Sunshine professional growing mix: Sun Gro Horticulture Canada Ltd., Agawam, MA, USA).
3: All the trays were placed in popup cages (24  24  36 in, Biogentex Laboratories, Inc., TX, USA) inside the greenhouse conditions at 27 C and RH 70%.
4: Trays were monitored daily for germination for 70 days starting from the day after sowing until no further germination was observed for 5 consecutive days.
5: Germination was measured in two ways; number of seeds germinated over total seeds planted (germination rate), and number of seeds germinated per week (speed of germination).
6: After seedlings produced 24 true leaves, they were transplanted to square pots (4  4  6 in) inside the popup cages.
