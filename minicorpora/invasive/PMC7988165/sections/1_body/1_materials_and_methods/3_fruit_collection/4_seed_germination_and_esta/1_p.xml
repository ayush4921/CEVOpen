<p id="Par15">To examine seed germination and seedling establishment, 200 seeds from each of the pooled seed banks (from all eight locations) were used (1600 seeds in total; 800 per treatment). Before sowing, half of the seeds (400 each from each treatment) were treated with 20 ml of gibberellic acid in deionized water (mowed/unmowed) (GA
 <sub>3</sub>, 1000 ppm; Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) for 24 h to examine whether treatment × seed germination is impacted by the rooting hormone

 </sup>. After the seed treatment, 50 seeds each were sown each in a plastic tray (7.5 in × 12.5 in × 2 in) using a sterilized potting mixture (Sunshine professional growing mix: Sun Gro Horticulture Canada Ltd., Agawam, MA, USA). All the trays were placed in popup cages (24 × 24 × 36 in, Biogentex Laboratories, Inc., TX, USA) inside the greenhouse conditions at 27 °C and RH 70%. Trays were monitored daily for germination for 70 days starting from the day after sowing until no further germination was observed for 5 consecutive days. Germination was measured in two ways; number of seeds germinated over total seeds planted (germination rate), and number of seeds germinated per week (speed of germination). After seedlings produced 2–4 true leaves, they were transplanted to square pots (4 × 4 × 6 in) inside the popup cages.
