<p id="Par11">All the fruits produced by ~ 100 different plants (genets) with at least ten genets from each location were collected over one week in December 2019. The mowing (4 rounds of mowing) ended in late summer (September) and so the plants could set and mature fruits. Care was taken to ensure that the genets were at least 5 m apart to minimize any clonality effects in sampling since SNL can vegetatively reproduce through rhizomes. The collected fruits, from different locations in the city, were pooled per genet, bagged and stored at room temperature in lab for seed extraction.</p>
