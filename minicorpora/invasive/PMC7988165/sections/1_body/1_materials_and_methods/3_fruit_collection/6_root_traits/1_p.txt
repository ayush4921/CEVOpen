0: Morphological characteristics of roots were measured from a total of 30 plants composed of both treatments: 15 mowed and 15 unmowed.
1: These plants were randomly chosen from the transplanted seedlings, all at the same age post-transplanting (4 weeks after transplanting).
2: The plants were cut at soil level to separate the shoots from the roots and then gently removed from their respective pots and placed on a 3-part strainer, where soil was gently washed off the roots.
3: Image acquisition of roots was completed by placing washed roots submerged in water on a transparent tray and scanned with an EPSON Flatbed Scanner (EPSON Expression 11000XL 1.8 V3.49 3.49), part of the WinRHIZO package (Regent Instruments Inc., Quebec, Canada).
4: WinRHIZO has been used to efficiently and precisely determine complex root parameters that are normally prone to human error 58 WinRHIZO was used to digitize and quantify various root traits such as total root length (cm), area (cm 2), the number of tips, forks, crossing (fine roots) and root volume (cm 3), among others.
5: Specific root length (m/g) was determined by dividing the total root length by total root dry biomass.
