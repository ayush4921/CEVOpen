0: All the fruits produced by ~ 100 different plants (genets) with at least ten genets from each location were collected over one week in December 2019.
1: The mowing (4 rounds of mowing) ended in late summer (September) and so the plants could set and mature fruits.
2: Care was taken to ensure that the genets were at least 5 m apart to minimize any clonality effects in sampling since SNL can vegetatively reproduce through rhizomes.
3: The collected fruits, from different locations in the city, were pooled per genet, bagged and stored at room temperature in lab for seed extraction.
