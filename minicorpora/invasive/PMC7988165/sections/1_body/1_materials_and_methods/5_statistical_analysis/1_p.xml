<p id="Par26">For total fruits, seed mass, seeds/fruit and total seeds data, we used a General Linear Model (GLM) with Poisson distribution. Tukey comparisons were carried out to determine pairwise differences among the factors including sub-populations and mowing or unmowed treatments. Fruit diameter was analyzed using the non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test to determine if mowed populations varied from unmowed, since data failed to meet normality assumptions even after transformation attempts. Plant height from mowed and unmowed sub-populations were collected twice and analyzed separately using Kruskal–Wallis tests. Damage assessment on 0–4 scale data was analyzed using Poisson regression. Seed germination data was also analyzed with a General linear Model with mowing (or unmowed control), GA (no GA control) treatment and week (week 0–9) as factors, followed by Tukey posthoc tests to tease apart pairwise comparisons. For analyses of root traits, we used a combination of two-tailed T tests and non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis tests based on the distribution of the data. Variables for which the data didn’t meet normality assumptions even after transformation were analyzed by Kruskal–Wallis tests. Specific root length was analyzed using two tailed t-tests. Transformed data was back transformed for reporting as means and for plots. In both analyses mowed/unmowed treatment was used as the predictor. For experimental design and analyses, each genet (individual plant) is considered as the unit of replication, for both parental generation (sub-populations) and seedlings. The detailed statistics are displayed in the table, and a few of the most relevant root traits of interest

For field herbivore presence (yes or no) and herbivory scale (0–4) data analyses, we used binary logistic regression and ordinal logistic regression respectively with treatment (mowed /unmowed) as the predictor. P values were reported based on Wald’s test. To confirm that any preexisting variation in plant traits did not factor into field herbivory assessment, we also ran a t-test on plant height (Supplementary Data). 
 <italic>M. sexta</italic> mass gain and 
 <italic>L. texana</italic> mass gain was analyzed using the Kruskal–Wallis test due to non-normal distribution. 
 <italic>A. craccivora</italic> population growth was analyzed by examining total aphids found (adults and nymphs) using a Poisson distribution fit model regression due to non-normal count data. Both treatment and replicate were used as predictors and P values were reported from Wald test
 <italic>.</italic> For trichomes we ran multiple analyses; total trichomes were analyzed using a 2-sample t-test, and a Two-way Anova was used for estimating whether the trichomes varied due to mowing treatment of leaf surface. Treatment (mowed/unmowed) and side (abaxial/adaxial) were used as factors. Similar to total trichomes, stellate and non-glandular trichome number, and number of spikes on stellate trichomes were also analyzed using 2 sample t-tests. All analyses were carried out using Minitab (Minitab Inc, State College, PA, USA) and plots were made using GraphPad Prism (LA Jolla, California, USA) software.
