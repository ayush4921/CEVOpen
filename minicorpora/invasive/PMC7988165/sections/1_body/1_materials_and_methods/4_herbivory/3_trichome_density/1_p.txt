0: To examine how trichome density in offspring was influenced by mowing treatment imposed on maternal plants, we chose one leaf each from 10 randomly chosen offspring seedlings from mowed and unmowed parents.
1: These leaves were cut near node of the plant to avoid any damage to the leaf, then using a hole punch two small disks (6 to 8 mm diameter) were cut for each leaf.
2: Leaf disks were taped with carbon tape and then was placed on a 15 mm aluminum stage.
3: To examine the trichomes in detail, we used a desktop scanning electron microscope (SNE-4500 M Plus Tabletop SEM; Nanoimages LLC, Pleasanton, California, USA).
4: Images of abaxial and adaxial sides of leaves were taken at 60  magnification with 5KV using SE detector.
5: For each sample, we did the following measurements: trichomes on abaxial and adaxial surface, number of glandular vs non-glandular trichomes, and then for each sample, 10 random non glandular stellate trichomes were chosen and the number of individual spikes on them were counted.
6: For counting, the scanning electron micrograph was saved as a .jpg file and each trichome was identified, labeled and counted 63.
