0: To determine whether mowing impacted plant response against specific herbivores, we followed up the field experiment with lab assays with three different herbivores: Tobacco hornworm ( Manduca sexta), a generalist on Solanaceae, cow pea aphid ( Aphis craccivora) a generalist aphid, and Texas Potato Beetle ( Leptinotarsa texana), a specialist on SLN.
1: These three herbivores are commonly found in the native SNL populations, and have been documented to successfully complete their life cycle on SNL.
