0: Like  A. craccivora, we used a lab colony of  L. texana reared on Solanaceae species from individuals collected from SNL from the native populations in the Summer of 2019.
1: We used newly molted second instar grubs for the experiment, pre weighed and placed on fully developed leaves of 15 mowed and 15 unmowed treatment plants.
2: After four days, beetles were removed from the plant using a small paint brush and weighed on a balance (Accuris Dx W3101A-220, Mid Sci, Valley Park, MO, USA) for the second mass.
3: Like  M. sexta, mass gain was then calculated.
