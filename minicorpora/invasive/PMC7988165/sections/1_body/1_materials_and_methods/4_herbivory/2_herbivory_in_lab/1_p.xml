<p id="Par21">To determine whether mowing impacted plant response against specific herbivores, we followed up the field experiment with lab assays with three different herbivores: Tobacco hornworm (
 <italic>Manduca sexta</italic>), a generalist on Solanaceae, cow pea aphid (
 <italic>Aphis craccivora</italic>) a generalist aphid, and Texas Potato Beetle (
 <italic>Leptinotarsa texana</italic>), a specialist on SLN. These three herbivores are commonly found in the native SNL populations, and have been documented to successfully complete their life cycle on SNL.
