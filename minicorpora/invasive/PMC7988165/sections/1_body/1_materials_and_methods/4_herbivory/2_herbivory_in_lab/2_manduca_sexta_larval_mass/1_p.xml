 <italic>M. sexta</italic> eggs were placed on a 1 cm
 <sup>3</sup> cubes diet inside a petri dish until they hatched. After hatching, first instar caterpillars were pre-weighed and placed on fully developed leaves of 4 weeks post transplanted seedlings of SLN. In this experiment, sixty SLN plants (thirty mowed and thirty unmowed) were used. The plants were not randomly selected, but chosen based on similarity in size, height, and number of leaves to reduce any confounding traits on herbivore mass gain. A coffee filter paper was wrapped around the potted plants around the midpoint of the stem, such that each plant was divided into two halves, with each half receiving one caterpillar each. Two first instar 
 <italic>M. sexta</italic> caterpillars were placed on each plant, one caterpillar above the coffee filter and one caterpillar below the filter on a fully developed leaf and could feed continuously for 4 days. The caterpillars were starved for 4–6 h before the experiment to clear their gut. After 4 days, the caterpillars were removed, and post mass data was collected. Using the following equation mass gain was calculated: mass gain = (final mass − initial mass)/initial mass
