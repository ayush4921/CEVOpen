0: Aphis craccivora used for the experiment was from a lab colony reared on multiple Solanaceae species.
1: In this experiment a total of twenty-four plants; twelve mowed and twelve unmowed were used.
2: For the population assay, three third instar aphid nymphs were transferred from the host plants to a young leaf of treatment plant using a paint brush and were allowed to grow and reproduce.
3: The plants were separated and caged individually to minimize any accidental spread.
4: Aphids were monitored and counted every five days and were counted twice.
5: For both counts adults and nymphs were counted separately.
