 <italic>Aphis craccivora</italic> used for the experiment was from a lab colony reared on multiple Solanaceae species. In this experiment a total of twenty-four plants; twelve mowed and twelve unmowed were used. For the population assay, three third instar aphid nymphs were transferred from the host plants to a young leaf of treatment plant using a paint brush and were allowed to grow and reproduce. The plants were separated and caged individually to minimize any accidental spread. Aphids were monitored and counted every five days and were counted twice. For both counts adults and nymphs were counted separately.
