<p id="Par24">Like 
 <italic>A. craccivora</italic>, we used a lab colony of 
 <italic>L. texana</italic> reared on Solanaceae species from individuals collected from SNL from the native populations in the Summer of 2019. We used newly molted second instar grubs for the experiment, pre weighed and placed on fully developed leaves of 15 mowed and 15 unmowed treatment plants. After four days, beetles were removed from the plant using a small paint brush and weighed on a balance (Accuris Dx W3101A-220, Mid Sci, Valley Park, MO, USA) for the second mass. Like 
 <italic>M. sexta</italic>, mass gain was then calculated.
