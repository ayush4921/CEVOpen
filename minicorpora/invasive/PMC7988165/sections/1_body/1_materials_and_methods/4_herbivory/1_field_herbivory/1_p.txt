0: To determine whether mowed and unmowed plants experience similar herbivory levels in field, we did a field survey on ~ 10 plants per subpopulation and estimated herbivory levels on a 04 scale; 0 = 0%, 1 = 25%, 2 = 50%, 3 = 75% and 4 = 100% of the leaves damaged 59.
1: Since mowing continuously reduced leaf area, we restricted our estimation to the youngest 56 fully developed leaves to be consistent across treatments.
2: In addition, we also estimated herbivory presence on a yes or no (0 or 1) binary scale as an additional line of data for herbivory in field.
3: The same methodology was repeated for seedlings from the next generation, except the transplanted seedlings in pots were transported to field and placed in SNL populations as a pair (one mowed and one unmowed; 15 pairs) 1 m apart for 7 days, followed by damage and herbivore assessment as before.
