<p id="Par20">To determine whether mowed and unmowed plants experience similar herbivory levels in field, we did a field survey on ~ 10 plants per subpopulation and estimated herbivory levels on a 0–4 scale; 0 = 0%, 1 = 25%, 2 = 50%, 3 = 75% and 4 = 100% of the leaves damaged

 </sup>. Since mowing continuously reduced leaf area, we restricted our estimation to the youngest 5–6 fully developed leaves to be consistent across treatments. In addition, we also estimated herbivory presence on a yes or no (0 or 1) binary scale as an additional line of data for herbivory in field. The same methodology was repeated for seedlings from the next generation, except the transplanted seedlings in pots were transported to field and placed in SNL populations as a pair (one mowed and one unmowed; 15 pairs) 1 m apart for 7 days, followed by damage and herbivore assessment as before.
