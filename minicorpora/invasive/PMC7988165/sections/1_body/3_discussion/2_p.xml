<p id="Par36">While examining fitness traits, we found that unmowed genets were taller and produced significantly more fruits and total seeds (total fruits X seeds/fruit) than their mowed counterparts (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), confirming that these genets can flourish in anthropogenically undisturbed environments

 </sup>. In contrast, while unmowed genets produced more fruits, the seed mass of mowed individuals was significantly higher (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C). It has been well understood that heavier seeds tend to germinate more and rapidly, therefore seed mass is considered a strong indicator of fitness
