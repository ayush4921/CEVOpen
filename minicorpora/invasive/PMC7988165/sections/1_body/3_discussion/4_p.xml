<p id="Par38">Interestingly though, enhanced germination rates and faster germination didn’t translate into better growth traits in mowed offspring. We found that seedlings from unmowed parents were taller and had more leaves, suggesting that mowing-induced trait enhancement is possibly limited to germination, rather than cascading throughout the growing season

 </sup>. Additionally, weeds like SNL have higher root investment, since rhizomes are a major reproductive strategy, ensuring fitness. Similar to growth and fitness traits, we found that unmowed plants had higher values of various metrics of root biomass, including root area and number of fine roots, but a key metric of the cost–benefit ratio of roots, specific root length, was significantly higher in offspring of mowed plants (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Specific root length has been associated with an enhanced ability to acquire nutrients and is known to be independent of other plant trait economics spectra

 </sup>. This is a significant result as it clearly shows that while total available resources are limited, mowed offspring construct fine roots more efficiently, and thus may be able to partially offset these negative effects, giving them enhanced ability to acquire water and nutrients at a given size. Additionally, this ability can be critical in limited resource environments. Their potential implications for invasion success, and consequential effects on plant diversity under different land management regimes
