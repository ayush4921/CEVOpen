<p id="Par37">As a consequence of heavier seeds on mowed plants, we found that germination was more frequent and more rapid when compared to unmowed plant seed progeny. We also introduced the phytohormone GA
 <sub>3</sub> to test if the germination accelerant phytohormone treatment can differentially influence germination rate
 <sup>

 </sup>, but surprisingly, found that GA
 <sub>3</sub> has no effect on germination rates on mowed or unmowed treatments. We speculated that if GA
 <sub>3</sub> brought the germination rates of unmowed plants up to par with the mowed ones, it would suggest that enhanced GA
 <sub>3</sub> signaling in the mowed plants can possibly be induced by mowing. Clearly, enhanced germination is the result of the environmental stress through mowing, possibly independent of any genetic effects, an area that needs to be examined further. We also estimated the germination cycle of SLN in its native range. We show that SLN seeds have around 50% germination rate and tend to germinate the most within the first 5 weeks of seeding, as opposed to later in the season (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). This coincides with a study on germination timings of another (of many) weed species, where 
 <italic>Ambrosia artemisiifolia</italic> L., 
 <italic>Ambrosia trifida</italic> (rag weed), and 
 <italic>Polygonum pensylvanicum</italic> L., (Knotweed) all had large flushes of germination in the first 5 weeks from their planting, followed by very little to no germination after

 </sup>. Gioria and Pysek, 2016 also found a strong tendency for invasive plants to germinate earlier and faster than their native counterparts. In addition, since germination rate also reflects local adaptation

 </sup> to changes in the environment
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>
 </sup>, our data complements the list of studies on local adaptation, with traits measured in two generations of growth. For a weed species that tends to undergo constant disturbance and possible extinction of founding populations, a rapid and relatively high germination rate make it a grave concern for conservation, invasion and management policies
