 </sup> that feed on SLN. In the parental generation, we found that mowed plants suffered lower damage in the field. The major herbivore of SLN in our subpopulations was Texas potato beetle (
 <italic>Leptinotarsa texana</italic>) grubs and adults, other herbivores present were tobacco hornworm (
 <italic>Manduca sexta</italic>), cowpea aphid (
 <italic>Aphis craccivora</italic>), and eggplant tortoise beetle (
 <italic>Gratiana pallidula</italic>). Even more interesting was that the reduced herbivory was consistent in offspring when they were exposed to herbivores in an area close to our subpopulations. Clearly, mowing (damage) in parental generation enhanced offspring defenses and they possibly had higher constitutive defenses that reduced both herbivore incidence and herbivory levels

 </sup>. For example., it has been shown that higher alkaloid production in tall fescue (
 <italic>Festuca arundinacea</italic>) and perennial ryegrass (
 <italic>Lolium sp.</italic>) post mowing resulted in lower herbivore damage, supporting the idea these disturbance help plants to withstand and maybe even better defend against herbivores
