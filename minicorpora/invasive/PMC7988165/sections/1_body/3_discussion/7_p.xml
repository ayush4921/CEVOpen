<p id="Par41">Finally, the variation in herbivore response to mowing in offspring in laboratory conditions and field conditions lead us to ask whether plant defenses correlate with these herbivore growth traits. Our comprehensive examination of the trichome morphology of SLN allowed us to address this directly. Using a series of manipulative experiments, we have previously documented pre and post ingestive roles of trichomes as a plant defense in Solanum spp-

 </sup>. Surprisingly, our results showed that offspring from mowed parents had lower trichome density (stellate, the major trichome type), and that they also had lower number of individual spikes on them. Trichomes have been well documented to be an effective defense against herbivores, by either restricting their access

 </sup>. We speculate that although trichomes are thought to be primarily regulated by JA pathway, other phytohormones including GA

 </sup>. Our data clearly shows that the interplay of JA, SA mediated defenses, herbivore feeding and trichomes are far more complicated. It would be interesting to identify and quantify secondary metabolites (alkaloids, and plant volatiles), signaling compounds (phytohormones) and their gene expression to tease apart these effects, and to examine potential trade-offs between chemical and structural defenses and herbivory in this species.
