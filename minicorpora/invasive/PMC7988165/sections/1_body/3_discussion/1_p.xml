<p id="Par35">In this study we examined how disturbance (mowing) affects reproductive fitness traits, defenses, and their cascading effects on SLN over two growing seasons. Collectively, we found that although mowing reduces reproductive fitness by removing photosynthetic area, mowing also leads to local adaptation for fitness and defense traits in both parental and offspring generations, potentially leading to become a superweed. More importantly, we also found that these differences are not similar for all the traits we measured. Enhanced fitness and defense traits in the offspring, from mowed parents indirectly suggest that local disturbance can lead to better fit seedlings with a possibility of making species like SLN a superweed, adding another layer of complexity in understanding its invasion and management
