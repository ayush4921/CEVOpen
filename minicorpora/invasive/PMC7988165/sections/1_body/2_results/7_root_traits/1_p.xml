<p id="Par34">In addition to above ground traits, we also examined below-ground root traits and their differences between seedlings from mowed and unmowed parents. There were no significant differences between the two groups in root (Kruskal–Wallis tests; t = − 0.130; P &lt; 0.108) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>A, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) and shoot (Kruskal–Wallis tests; t = 1.24; P = 0.225) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>B, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) length. However, we found that the major root traits such as whole root area (Kruskal–Wallis tests; t = − 2.54 P = 0.017) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>C, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), root surface area (Kruskal–Wallis tests; P = 0.017) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>D, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), and fine roots (Kruskal–Wallis tests; t = − 3.42 P &lt; 0.0002) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>E, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), were significantly higher in roots from seedlings of unmowed parents than their mowed counterparts. Interestingly, specific root length (SRL), a key root trait in resource acquisition, was significantly higher on mowed when compared to the unmowed seedlings (Two tailed T test; t = 2.02; P &lt; 0.049) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>F, Table
