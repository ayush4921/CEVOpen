<p id="Par28">Following our fitness traits experiments, seed germination showed that seeds from mowed maternal plants had significantly more germination than from unmowed (GLM; F = 9.85; P &lt; 0.002: Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). However, the phytohormone GA3 had no significant effect on germination rate for mowed and unmowed populations (GLM; F = 0.00; P = 0.974; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). Like other weed species, we also found significantly more seeds germinated during the early season than in the late season (GLM; F = 95.33; P &lt; 0.001) with most of the germination taking place in the first five weeks (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C).
