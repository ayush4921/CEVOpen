<p id="Par27">Analyses of total fruits production showed that unmowed genets produced significantly more fruits (GLM; F = 48.72; P &lt; 0.001; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A), and total seeds (Mean seeds × total fruits; GLM; F = 41.90; P &lt; 0.001; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B). However, we also found that there was no difference for fruit diameter (Kruskal–Wallis Test; P = 0.269; see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), and for mean number of seeds per fruits (GLM; F = 0.06; P = 0.809; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). Surprisingly, when we measured 100 seed mass, we found that seeds from mowed genets were significantly heavier than unmowed genets, suggesting that these embryos may be better fit (GLM; F = 3.35; P &lt; 0.001; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D), a question we addressed with the germination assays.
