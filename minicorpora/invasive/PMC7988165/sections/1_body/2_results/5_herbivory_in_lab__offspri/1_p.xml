<p id="Par31">Field damage results were further confirmed by herbivory experiments conducted in lab. We found the number of 
 <italic>A. craccivora</italic> on mowed plants to be significantly higher than on unmowed plants (Poisson distribution fit model regression; P-value &lt; 0.001; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A). However, our mass gain experiments of 
 <italic>M. sexta</italic> show significantly lower mass gain on mowed plants than on unmowed plants (Kruskal–Wallis test; H = 5.22; P-value = 0.022) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B). On the other hand, we found no significant difference in mass gain of 
 <italic>L. texana</italic> on both mowed and unmowed plants (Kruskal–Wallis test; H = 0.13; P-value = 0.715) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>C). Therefore, we speculate higher induction of jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway in mowed treatments, which is induced in plants upon attack by chewing insect pests. These results are akin to JA-SA (Salicylic acid pathway induced in plants upon attack by sucking insect pests) pathway negative crosstalk, where induction of one pathway downregulates the other.
