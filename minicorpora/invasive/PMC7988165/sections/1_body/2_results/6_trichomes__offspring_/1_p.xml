<p id="Par32">Contrary to our expectations, our results show that unmowed plants have significantly more trichomes than mowed treatments (Two sample T-test; t = − 2.53; P-value = 0.02) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A). We followed this by examining the abaxial and adaxial side of the leaves for both treatments. However, there was no significant differences in mean number of trichomes per side (Two-way Anova; F = 1.27; P-value = 0.26) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B) in either of the treatments (Two-way Anova; F = 3.50; P-value = 0.06) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B). SLN has both glandular and non-glandular (stellate) trichomes, dominated by non-glandular stellate trichomes. Similar to trichome density we also found that unmowed treatment had significantly more stellate trichomes (Two sample T-test; t = − 2.47; P-value &gt; 0.02) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>C), while no difference was found between treatments for glandular trichomes (Two sample T-test; t = − 0.10; P-value = 0.918) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>D). Using enhanced measurement features of the tabletop SEM, we also examined detailed morphology of non-glandular (stellate) trichomes and found that the seedlings from unmowed treatment also had significantly more spikes on their trichomes (Two sample T-test; t = − 6.26; P-value &lt; 0.00) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>E).
