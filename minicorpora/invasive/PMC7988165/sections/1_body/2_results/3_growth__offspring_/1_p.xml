<p id="Par29">Transplanted seedlings from the germination experiment were also monitored for health and vigor. We found that seedlings from unmowed parents had significantly more leaves per seedling (Poisson distribution fit model regression; Chi-square = 15.16; P &lt; 0.001) and were also significantly taller than mowed plants (Kruskal–Wallis test; t = − 3.81; P &lt; 0.001), suggesting better growth and developmental traits in unmowed seedlings (Fig.
