<p id="Par30">Analysis of herbivory data from field showed that significantly more herbivores were present on unmowed plants in comparison to mowed plants (Binary logistic regression; Chi-square = 16.92; P &gt; 0.001; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). Consequently, damage done by herbivores was also significantly more on unmowed plants (Ordinal logistic regression; P-value = 0.037; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B).
