<p id="Par5">Clearly, anthropogenic disturbances have a huge impact on weed success, and we are yet to understand the factors that contribute to this. Plants are known to evolve in short periods of time in response to environmental changes including temperature and CO
 <sub>2</sub> levels, and selection favors genotypes with traits capable of surviving such stressors. These include growth, defense, resource allocation, flowering and reproduction, and germination rate is considered as one of the most important factors that indicate successful adaptation against environmental vagaries

 </sup>. Among the many weedy traits that provide an edge over non weedy plants, the ability to self-fertilize is also considered critical

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>
 </sup>. In line with Baker’s theory
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>
 </sup>, it is observed that self-fertility is common in weeds, and the ability to self-pollinate and set viable seeds ensures fitness in founding populations, when cross pollen from conspecifics may be low, due to small population size and reduced number of unrelated individuals
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>
 </sup>. While most studies have addressed these questions using fitness measures as variables of interest
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>
 </sup>, we still lack a complete understanding of whether other biotic and abiotic factors can contribute and complicate the interactions at multiple trophic levels. In their home ranges, weeds are constantly subject to high herbivory pressure from co-evolved herbivores, a phenomenon lacking in their invasive habitats- commonly known as enemy free space. For example, the tropical fire ant, 
 <italic>Solenopsis geminata (</italic>Frabicius), and the Asian house rat, 
 <italic>Rattus tanezumi</italic> Temminck, are widely known to consume weed seeds of 
 <italic>Digitaria ciliaris</italic>, 
 <italic>Echinochloa colona</italic> and 
 <italic>Eleusine indica</italic> and control weed populations in rice fields
