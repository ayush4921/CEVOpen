0: To examine reproductive fitness, defenses, and possible local adaptation due to mowing, we used a combination of field, growth chamber, common garden, and lab experiments with multiple genets from 4 mowed and unmowed sub populations of Silverleaf nightshade (SLN) to ask the following questions: (1) Does mowing influence growth and fitness traits, (2) On what scale does mowing affect herbivore incidence and field damage, (3) Does mowing lead to local adaptation on growth and fitness traits, (4) Are there cascading effects on plant defenses against generalist and specialist herbivores, and (5) Are these effects if any, also prevalent in root traits, since the species also reproduce through rhizomatous roots?
