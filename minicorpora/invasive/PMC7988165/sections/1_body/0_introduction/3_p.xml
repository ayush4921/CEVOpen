<p id="Par4">Weeds in urban, agricultural, and other forms of managed systems undergo multiple mowing events during their growing season and must constantly reprogram growth, defense and fitness, else risk extinction in local populations

 </sup>. For example, Yong et al. demonstrated in the invasive weed 
 <italic>Erigeron annuus</italic>, mowing reduced seed mass but led to variation in pappus length, and achene size, and speculated that these differences lead to better spread and higher survival rate

 </sup>. This interplay of anthropogenic disturbance and weed ecology, and its role inÂ cascading growth and defense traits needs to be better understood, especially since many weed species are perennial and can propagate asexually over multiple years and growing seasons
