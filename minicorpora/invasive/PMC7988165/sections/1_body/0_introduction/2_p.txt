0: The effects of human disturbance on weed success have also been well researched.
1: Collectively, these studies suggest that land and soil disturbance due to human activities tend to enhance weed success both in natural and agricultural environments 16  18.
2: Many plants that thrive in hot and dry environments tend to become weedy with fast growth and drought resistance, primarily facilitated and enhanced by human disturbance 19.
3: These can range from clearing, draining, and other human activities that promote erosion, collectively damaging non-weedy vegetation 4.
4: Recently, in the semi-arid open forest with  Prosopis caldenia (Caldenal), anthropogenic disturbance (e.g., fire, grazing) played a significant role in the establishment of widely distributed ruderal weed specie 20.
5: In rhizomatous weeds such as Carolina horsenettle ( Solanum carolinense; Solanaceae), a single mother plant can produce ~ 21 new sprouts in the following season, a grave concern to farmers when rhizomes are broken apart in agricultural lands as part of tillage 21.
6: While obvious human-driven disturbances have been studied extensively among management practices, mowing as a disturbance has been overlooked, even though mowing is known to dramatically reduce photosynthetic area and reduce biomass, forcing them to reallocate resources 22  24.
