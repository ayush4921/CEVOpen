<p id="Par8">We hypothesized that due to consistent loss of photosynthetic area and growing time, mowed plants will exhibit lower growth and fitness traits, but have enhanced defenses since mowing is regularly inflicted and is also a form of mechanical wounding and can lead to defense signaling and local adaptation. We also hypothesized that offspring, from mowed mother plants will have compromised growth and fitness traits due to lower resource allocation but will also have higher constitutive defenses due to damage in the parental generation. To answer these questions, we used three herbivores-. Tobacco hornworm (
 <italic>Manduca sexta</italic>), a generalist onÂ Solanaceae, cow pea aphid (
 <italic>Aphis craccivora</italic>) a generalist aphid and Texas Potato Beetle (
 <italic>Leptinotarsa texana</italic>), a co-evolved specialist on SLN for our herbivory experiments. And, to examine root traits, we used WinRhizo Pro 2019 root scanner to measure the key root traits involved in weed success.
