0: A large body of work has demonstrated that in the absence of these natural predators, weeds in an enemy free space are more likely to thrive and become a larger problem as they are highly invasive 39  42.
1: In addition, there is the possibility for local herbivores that differ in specialization and feeding guild to also impact these defense traits and weed fitness, by checking weed populations at an ecosystem threshold.
2: For example, we previously found that in  S. carolinense, intraspecific variation due to experimental inbreeding affected the recruitment of herbivores and natural enemies in field, by selectively improving fitness of outbred progeny when compared to inbred through better defenses, in addition to better growth and reproductive fitness 43 with transgenerational effects 44.
3: Expanding this line of research into anthropogenic disturbance is critical to determine the evolutionary ecology, an area traditionally under-explored, but has gained momentum recently 43,  44.
4: Being the chief contributor of fitness, seeds are loaded by mother plants with nutrients which have direct effects on offspring success 45.
5: Parental stress can lead to depleted resource allocation to seeds as a result of the lack of resources due to photosynthetic tissue loss by herbivory, or reallocation and tradeoffs at defense-fitness traits 46  48.
