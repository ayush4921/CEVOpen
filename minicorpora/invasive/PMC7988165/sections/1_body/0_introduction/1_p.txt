0: Weeds are generally defined as undesired plant species that can invade ecosystems, causing harm to both biotic and abiotic ecosystem components 1,  2.
1: The factors contributing to the ability of weedy plant species to establish and colonize have been well understood 3  5.
2: The general consensus is that weed species tend to have enhanced traits that allow them to succeed either in their native or introduced habitats, when compared to their non-weedy counterparts 6  8.
3: This could be their ability to either outcompete heterospecifics and/or have better growth, fitness, and defense traits to name a few 9.
4: For example, allelopathy in weedy sunflower ( Helianthus spp.)
5: inhibits mustard ( Brassica spp.)
6: seed germination and lantana ( Lantana camara) inhibits wheat ( Triticum aestivum), soybean ( Glycine max), and corn ( Zea mays) growth 10,  11.
7: On the other hand, weeds such as  Rhododendron ponticum and  Rhododendron maximum colonize forests by adaptative switching between sexual and asexual reproduction, thereby reducing tree growth and regeneration, causing immense forest damage.
8: They are also more tolerant to cold and shade and express plasticity in morphological and physiological adaptions to varying environmental conditions 12.
9: More recently, there has been tremendous interest to identify and quantify other contributing factors to weed success including their ability to cope with climate change, and more importantly, human disturbance 13  15.
10: However, most of these studies are limited to traits observed in a single growing season, ignoring any possible cascading effects.
