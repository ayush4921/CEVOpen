<p id="Par3">The effects of human disturbance on weed success have also been well researched. Collectively, these studies suggest that land and soil disturbance due to human activities tend to enhance weed success both in natural and agricultural environments

 </sup>. Many plants that thrive in hot and dry environments tend to become weedy with fast growth and drought resistance, primarily facilitated and enhanced by human disturbance

 <italic>Prosopis caldenia</italic> (Caldenal), anthropogenic disturbance (e.g., fire, grazing) played a significant role in the establishment of widely distributed ruderal weed specie

 </sup>. In rhizomatous weeds such as Carolina horsenettle (
 <italic>Solanum carolinense</italic>; Solanaceae), a single mother plant can produce ~ 21 new sprouts in the following season, a grave concern to farmers when rhizomes are broken apart in agricultural lands as part of tillage

 </sup>. While obvious human-driven disturbances have been studied extensively among management practices, mowing as a disturbance has been overlooked, even though mowing is known to dramatically reduce photosynthetic area and reduce biomass, forcing them to reallocate resources
