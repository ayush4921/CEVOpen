<p id="Par6">A large body of work has demonstrated that in the absence of these natural predators, weeds in an enemy free space are more likely to thrive and become a larger problem as they are highly invasive

 </sup>. In addition, there is the possibility for local herbivores that differ in specialization and feeding guild to also impact these defense traits and weed fitness, by checking weed populations at an ecosystem threshold. For example, we previously found that in
