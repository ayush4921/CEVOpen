 </sup> with slight modification. Ten gram (total two kilogram) of HR was tightly wrapped with one layer of filter paper and soxhlet extraction with 95% ethanol for 3 h. The extraction was then concentrated into paste using a rotary evaporator (Rotavapor RE-52A coupled with SHE-III circulating water vacuum pump, Shanghai), then it was dissolved in distilled water and extracted three times with petroleum ether, n-butanol and ethyl acetate. The same components were mixed and concentrated, resulting in three concentrated extraction, being petroleum ether extract (PE), ethyl acetate extract (EE) and n-butanol extract (NE), respectively. The concentrated extractions were then stored in seal at 4 ℃ in dark place.
