0: Fresh leaves were separately collected to measure the related enzymes peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT) and malondialdehyde (MDA) content with kits (Lai Er Bio-Tech).
1: Use POD kit, CAT kit to measure leaf enzyme activity and MDA kit to measure leaf MDA content.
2: Collect fresh clonal plant leaves, rinse 3 times with pure water, wipe dry, weigh 0.2 g and cut into a 2 mL centrifuge tube, add 1.8 mL phosphate buffer, crush with a high-throughput tissue grinder, and then use a centrifuge for 3000 rpm/min Centrifuge, take the supernatant and store at 4 C for testing (the whole process of leaf treatment is performed under low temperature conditions).
