 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> and the fractions of the concentrated extracts (PE, EE and NE, with a concentration of 2 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) dissolved in distilled water were add into petri dishes (9 cm diameter) covered with two layers of filter paper. Dishes without any HR extracts were taken as the control (distilled water). Five plant tissues of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> were randomly placed in each dish. Each plant tissue contained one node that was 3 cm long and 0.4 cm in stem thick. After 15 days incubation in an incubator (temperature 28℃, light intensity 400 μmol·cm
