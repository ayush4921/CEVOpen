0: To verify the effects of HR extracts on the seeding development of  A. philoxeroides, the morphology indices were determined as follows.
1: Stem length and root length were measured directly with a ruler.
2: The number of nodes, leaves and roots were counted.
3: Plant biomass (aboveground and belowground) was measured following dried in oven at 65C for 48 h till constant weight 24.
4: Root/shoot ratio, leaf area ratio and leaf area were calculated as below 24,  60: \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\begin{aligned} {\text{Root}}/{\text{shoot}}\;{\text{ratio}} & = {\text{Underground}}/{\text{Aboveground}}\;{\text{biomass}}; \\ {\text{Leaf}}\;{\text{area}} & = \pi *\left( {\text{Leaf length}} \right)*\left( {\text{Leaf width}} \right)/{4}; \\ {\text{Leaf}}\;{\text{area}}\;{\text{ratio}}\left( {{\text{LAR}}} \right) & = {\text{Leaf area}}/{\text{Total biomass}}; \\ \end{aligned}$$\end{document}Root/shootratio=Underground/Abovegroundbiomass;Leafarea=Leaf lengthLeaf width/4;LeafarearatioLAR=Leaf area/Total biomass;
