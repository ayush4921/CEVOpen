0: A. philoxeroides and the fractions of the concentrated extracts (PE, EE and NE, with a concentration of 2 mg mL 1) dissolved in distilled water were add into petri dishes (9 cm diameter) covered with two layers of filter paper.
1: Dishes without any HR extracts were taken as the control (distilled water).
2: Five plant tissues of  A. philoxeroides were randomly placed in each dish.
3: Each plant tissue contained one node that was 3 cm long and 0.4 cm in stem thick.
4: After 15 days incubation in an incubator (temperature 28C, light intensity 400 molcm 2s 2, 16/8 h light/dark), the plant tissues were collected for experimental analysis.
