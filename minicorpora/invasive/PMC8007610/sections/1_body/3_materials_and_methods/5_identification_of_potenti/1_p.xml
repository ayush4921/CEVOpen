<p id="Par24">The extracted samples were dissolved in n-hexane (chromatographically pure) and analyzed by GC–MS (TRACE ISQ, Thermo Scientific). The injector temperature was 280℃. The initial column temperature was constant at 60℃ for 5 min, increased to 100 ℃ at a rate of 3.5 ℃/min for 5 min, then ramped to 200 ℃ at 8 ℃/min for 5 min. The temperature was then brought to 280℃ at a rate of 15 ℃/min and held until the end of the 15-min run. Helium was the carrier gas and the program was not divided.</p>
