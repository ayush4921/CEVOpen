0: The extracted samples were dissolved in n-hexane (chromatographically pure) and analyzed by GCMS (TRACE ISQ, Thermo Scientific).
1: The injector temperature was 280C.
2: The initial column temperature was constant at 60C for 5 min, increased to 100 C at a rate of 3.5 C/min for 5 min, then ramped to 200 C at 8 C/min for 5 min.
3: The temperature was then brought to 280C at a rate of 15 C/min and held until the end of the 15-min run.
4: Helium was the carrier gas and the program was not divided.
