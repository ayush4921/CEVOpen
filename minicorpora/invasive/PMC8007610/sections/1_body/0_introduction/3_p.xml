<p id="Par4">So far, it is generally accepted in research that invasive plants are able to inhibit the growth of native plants mainly by allelopathy effects

 <italic>Tithonia diversifolia</italic>, an invasive species, significantly inhibited the radicle and plumule lengths of the maize (
 <italic>Zea mays</italic> L.) seedlings

 </sup>. Nevertheless, the potential allelopathy effects of native species on alligator weed are rarely investigated in China. One of the limited study showed that extracts of 
 <italic>Phragmites australis</italic> (Cav.) Trin inhibited the growth of invasive plant 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic>, providing a potential means to control this invasive plant

 <italic>Humulus scandens</italic> (Lour.) Merr. (belonging to the Moraceae family) is widely distributed in China, mainly growing at the edge of ditch, wasteland, ruins and forests

 <italic>H. scandens</italic> is more competitive than 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> in the field and laboratory
