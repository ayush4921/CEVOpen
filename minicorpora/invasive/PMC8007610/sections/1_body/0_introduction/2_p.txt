0: Three principal means are generally utilized to control the alligator weed, being physical 17, chemical 18,  19 and biological removal 20.
1: Physical methods are mainly to remove invasive plants by manual and mechanical methods; chemical methods are to spray chemical herbicides such as glyphosate to cause plant death; biological methods are mainly to control plant growth by natural enemies, soil animals and soil microorganisms.
2: These methods are usually suffering from expensive costs 4, lack of durability 19, risks of accelerating invasion 21 and producing herbicide-resistant weeds 22, leading to poor efficiency of invasion control.
3: However, allelopathy found its role in successful replacement control of invasive weeds 23,  24, consequently being introduced to combat the challenges of environmental pollution and herbicide resistance development 23,  25.
4: Simultaneously, allelochemicals could be produced and degraded under natural conditions, avoiding the risks of secondary contamination during chemical control.
5: A diverse array of allelochemicals are produced by plants, such as phenolic compounds, terpenoids, glycosteroids and alkaloids 26.
6: These chemicals are released by volatilization, leaching, root exudation and decomposition 27,  28.
7: Rhizosphere biochemistry that is shaped by allelopathy may drive geographic co-evolutionary trajectories, affecting the coexistence of species and the development of plant communities, ultimately resulting in an invasion control 29.
