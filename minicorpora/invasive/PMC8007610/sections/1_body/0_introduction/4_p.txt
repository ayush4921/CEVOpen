0: The present study focused on two questions: (1) Does  H. scandens root extract have allelopathic inhibition on the growth of  A. philoxeroides?
1: (2) What are the main secondary metabolites in  H. scandens that potentially have allelopathy effects on  A. philoxeroides?
2: By answering these important questions, this study aimed to develop a potential method to control the invasion of  A. philoxeroides by making use of the allelopathy effects of native plants if they exist.
