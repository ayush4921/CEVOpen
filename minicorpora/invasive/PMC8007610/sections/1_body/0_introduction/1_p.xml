<p id="Par2">Bioinvasion has become a serious environmental problem in the world in general and is considered as the second biggest threat to biodiversity. 
 <italic>Alternanthera philoxeroides</italic> (Mart.) Griseb. (an 
 <italic>Amaranthaceae</italic> family member, generally named alligator weed), is a worldwide invasive plant species
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>
 </sup> of which invasion was reported in 32 different countries
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>
 </sup>. It grows well in terrestrial, aquatic, hygrophytic and other habitats
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
 </sup>. 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> was initially introduced into China as animal feed in the 1930s because of its fast growth, high photosynthetic rate
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>
 </sup> and high nitrogen utilization rate. However, 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> is currently considered as a significant threat to plant diversity
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>
 </sup> because it is highly competitive to replace herbage and other plant species
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup>, and is aggressive against cotton, corn, rice, soybean and a variety of vegetables
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
 </sup>. Its asexual reproduction enables it to easily create new infection by stem fragmentation in most invaded areas
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>
 </sup>. Therefore, it has become a serious issue to control this invasive species.
