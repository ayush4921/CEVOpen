0: Bioinvasion has become a serious environmental problem in the world in general and is considered as the second biggest threat to biodiversity.
1: Alternanthera philoxeroides (Mart.)
2: Griseb.
3: (an  Amaranthaceae family member, generally named alligator weed), is a worldwide invasive plant species 1 of which invasion was reported in 32 different countries 2  4.
4: It grows well in terrestrial, aquatic, hygrophytic and other habitats 5.
5: A. philoxeroides was initially introduced into China as animal feed in the 1930s because of its fast growth, high photosynthetic rate 6  8 and high nitrogen utilization rate.
6: However,  A. philoxeroides is currently considered as a significant threat to plant diversity 9,  10 because it is highly competitive to replace herbage and other plant species 11,  12, and is aggressive against cotton, corn, rice, soybean and a variety of vegetables 13,  14.
7: Its asexual reproduction enables it to easily create new infection by stem fragmentation in most invaded areas 15,  16.
8: Therefore, it has become a serious issue to control this invasive species.
