0: So far, it is generally accepted in research that invasive plants are able to inhibit the growth of native plants mainly by allelopathy effects 30.
1: For instance, fresh shoot aqueous extract of  Tithonia diversifolia, an invasive species, significantly inhibited the radicle and plumule lengths of the maize ( Zea mays L.) seedlings 31.
2: Nevertheless, the potential allelopathy effects of native species on alligator weed are rarely investigated in China.
3: One of the limited study showed that extracts of  Phragmites australis (Cav.)
4: Trin inhibited the growth of invasive plant  A. philoxeroides, providing a potential means to control this invasive plant 24.
5: Using allelopathy of native plants to control invasive plants may become a potential novel method of invasion control.
6: Humulus scandens (Lour.)
7: Merr.
8: (belonging to the Moraceae family) is widely distributed in China, mainly growing at the edge of ditch, wasteland, ruins and forests 32.
9: H. scandens is more competitive than  A. philoxeroides in the field and laboratory 33.
