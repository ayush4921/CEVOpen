<p id="Par5">The present study focused on two questions: (1) Does 
 <italic>H. scandens</italic> root extract have allelopathic inhibition on the growth of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic>? (2) What are the main secondary metabolites in 
 <italic>H. scandens</italic> that potentially have allelopathy effects on 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic>? By answering these important questions, this study aimed to develop a potential method to control the invasion of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> by making use of the allelopathy effects of native plants if they exist.
