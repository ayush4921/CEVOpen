<p id="Par15">The results showed that 
 <italic>H. scandens</italic> root extracts significantly inhibited the growth of alligator weeds, mainly being indicated by physiological, biochemical and morphological indices. At the same time, 50 compounds were identified by GCâ€“MS, among which 5 compounds were identified for the first time from 
 <italic>H. scandens</italic> root extracts. However, there are still some limitation in this study. For instance, in the laboratory, allergies are not disturbed; but in the natural environment, it is affected by climate, temperature, soil animals, soil microorganisms and other factors. Therefore, the potential of allelopathy in the prevention and control of alligator weed should be elaborated in future research based on the actual environment.
