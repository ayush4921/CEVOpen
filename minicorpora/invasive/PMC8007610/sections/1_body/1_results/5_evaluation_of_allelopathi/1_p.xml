<p id="Par11">The three chemical extracts inhibited the stem length, node number, leaf number, leaf area, above- and total biomass of

 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The allelopathic inhibition of EE extract on stem, leaf and biomass of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> was significantly greater than that of PE and NE extracts, while EE extract promoted root length (
