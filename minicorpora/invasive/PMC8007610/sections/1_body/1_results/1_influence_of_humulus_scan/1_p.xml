<p id="Par6">Different chemical extracts of HR posed a significant influence on the growth of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Stem length, node number and leaf number decreased initially and then increased along with an increase in the extractant polarity. There were significant differences in the morphology index of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> between treatments and control, namely stem length (
 <italic>F</italic> = 13.16, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), node number (
 <italic>F</italic> = 23.34, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), leaf number (
 <italic>F</italic> = 43.396, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), leaf area (
 <italic>F</italic> = 144.7, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and root number (
 <italic>F</italic> = 20.128, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). The solvent extractions of petroleum ether extract (PE) and ethyl acetate extract (EE) had significant inhibitory effects on stem length (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.026, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), node number (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.001, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), leaf number (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and leaf area (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), which reduced 17–83% than those in control. However, the PE extraction promoted the root length of 
 <italic>A. Philoxeroides</italic> (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), which increased 36% than that in control (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>E). The n-butanol extract (NE) extraction significantly inhibited the node number (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.019) by 13%, while it has no significant effect on stem length (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.22) compared with control.
