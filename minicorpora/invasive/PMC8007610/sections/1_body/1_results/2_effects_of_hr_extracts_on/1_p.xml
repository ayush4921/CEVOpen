<p id="Par7">Different chemical extracts of HR had significant inhibitory effects on the total biomass (
 <italic>F</italic> = 24.315, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and aboveground biomass (
 <italic>F</italic> = 15.831, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) of 
 <italic>A. Philoxeroides</italic> as well, reducing the biomass by 16–68% compared with control (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The extracts EE and NE significantly reduced the belowground biomass (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.029) by 72% and 29%, respectively, while PE extract significantly increased it (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) by 37%. The PE and EE extracts had significant inhibitory effect on the leaf area ratio (LAR), reducing it by 53% and 50% respectively. The PE extract significantly enhanced the root/shoot ratio of 
 <italic>A. philoxeroides</italic> (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.004).
