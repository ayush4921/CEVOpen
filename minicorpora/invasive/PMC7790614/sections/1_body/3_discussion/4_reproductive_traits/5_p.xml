<p>Since disturbance increases resource availability (Jauni et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37071-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>), we expected that the fertilization and no‐competition treatments would likely affect the performance of the investigated plants in a similar manner. However, distinct effects were observed under these treatments; fertilization increased the inflorescence number of 
 <italic>B. pilosa,</italic> but this effect was not detected under the no‐competition treatment (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37071-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>h). In 
 <italic>B. frondosa</italic>, the plastic inflorescence‐number response to the no‐competition treatment was higher than the response to the fertilization treatment. Therefore, the effects of disturbance may not be straightforward, as the removal of neighboring plants via disturbance would influence not only resource availability but also other biological interactions, such as the physical interference of root growth patterns (Padilla et al.,
