0: In order to evaluate the phenotypic plasticity of  Bidens species, we computed the relative distance plasticity index (RDPI) of each trait following Valladares et al.
1: ( 2006).
2: For each species, we calculated relative distances of trait values between all pairs of individuals that were grown in different environments.
3: The RDPI for the competition was the average of the relative distances between competition treatments in the absence and presence of fertilization.
4: Similarly, the RDPI for the fertilization was the average of the relative distances between fertilization treatments in the absence and presence of the competition.
