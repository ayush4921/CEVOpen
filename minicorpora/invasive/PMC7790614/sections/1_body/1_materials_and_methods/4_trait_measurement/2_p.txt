0: After 6 weeks of treatment, we collected whole plants, washed their roots to remove all soil, and dried them in a dry oven (Hanbaek, Co. Ltd.) at 65C for three days to weigh their dry mass.
1: The R/S ratio was calculated as the dry mass of the root divided by the aboveground biomass.
2: Before harvesting, we took one fully expanded leaf from each plant and scanned it to measure the leaf area (Digimizer software ver.
3: 4.6.1; MedCalc Software bvda).
4: Leaves were dried at 65C for 3 days, and the SLA was calculated as the leaf area divided by the dry mass.
5: We estimated the leaf chlorophyll content using a SPAD520 plus chlorophyll meter (Spectrum Technologies).
6: The SPAD values exponentially correlate with the chlorophyll content.
