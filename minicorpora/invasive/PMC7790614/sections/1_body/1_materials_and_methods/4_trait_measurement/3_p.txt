0: We counted the number of inflorescences as a proxy of fecundity, because many fruits fell onto the ground during the experiment.
1: Bidens species produce morphologically distinctive achenes at the center and periphery of the capitulum (Brandel,  2004).
2: Disk achenes tend to be larger and disperse more readily than ray achenes (Rocha,  1996).
3: We randomly selected more than two achenes from the central area of the capitulum of each plant individual and photographed them using a stereomicroscope.
4: Images were analyzed using Digimizer software to measure the length of the pappi and the crosssectional areas of the achenes.
5: Achenes with broken pappi were excluded from the image analysis, and morphological characteristics were analyzed for a total of 250  B. bipinnata achenes, 290  B. frondosa achenes, and 140  B. Pilosa achenes.
