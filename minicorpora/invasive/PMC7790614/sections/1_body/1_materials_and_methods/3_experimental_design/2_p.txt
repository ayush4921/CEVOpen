0: Achenes of  Bidens species were sterilized using 0.5% sodium hypochlorite for 10 min, carefully scarified twice with a razor blade, and maintained in Petri dishes with wet filter paper in June 2016.
1: After cold treatment at 4C for 2 weeks, achenes were allowed to germinate in a customized walkin chamber under a 12hr light/dark photoperiod at 23C.
2: Individual seedlings were planted in flats containing commercial soil medium (ShinSung Mineral Co. Ltd.) and grown under the same conditions present during germination.
3: After one month of growth, plants were transplanted into plastic pots (21.5 cm  21.4 cm  15.5 cm) filled with 50% commercial saprolite and 50% soil medium on August 25, 2016.
4: The plants were maintained in a common garden at the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (351328.47 N, 1265036.81 E).
5: According to the Korean Meteorological Administration, the temperature during the 2016 summer season was the second hottest since 1973, and precipitation was around half of the tenyear average.
6: To prevent transplant shock and the abrupt death of plants, plants were watered every other day for one month.
