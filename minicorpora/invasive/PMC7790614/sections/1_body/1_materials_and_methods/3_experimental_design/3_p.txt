0: To evaluate the effects of competition and fertilization, we employed a full factorial design with four treatment combinations.
1: As a competition treatment, we transplanted one individual seedling of each  Bidens species to the center of pots containing  Festuca arundinacea (tall fescue).
2: F. arundinacea was chosen as a competing species because it has been widely used to recover anthropogenically disturbed areas in Korea.
3: Before transplantation, 1 g of  F. arundinacea seeds was sowed in each pot following the distributor's recommendations and grown for one and a half months in the common garden.
4: To simulate the highnutrient content of soil in agricultural areas, half of the pots in each competition treatment received 1 g of slowrelease fertilizer pellets (Osmocote Plus N:P:K 13  13  13 + 2MgO + trace element, Everris International B.V.) following the manufacturer's instructions.
5: Pots containing plants were randomly positioned using a completely randomized design.
6: Thirty individuals of each plant species were used for each of the four treatments, resulting in a total of 360 plants.
7: We harvested half of the plants to measure plant growth and functional traits 6 weeks after the treatment application.
8: The remaining plants were grown until they completed reproduction to measure fecundity and achene traits.
