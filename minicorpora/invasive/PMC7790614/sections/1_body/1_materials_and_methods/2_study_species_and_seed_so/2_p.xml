<p>We examined two alien (
 <italic>B. frondosa</italic>, 
 <italic>B. pilosa</italic>) and one native 
 <italic>Bidens</italic> species (
 <italic>B. bipinnata</italic>), Asteraceae. All three species are herbaceous erect weedy species that inhabit disturbed areas or the periphery of rice fields in Korea. The achenes of 
 <italic>B. bipinnata</italic> and 
 <italic>B. pilosa</italic> are oblong‐shaped with three to four barbed awns, but that of 
 <italic>B. frondosa</italic> is obovate‐shaped with two awns. The achenes used in this study were obtained from the seed stock center in the Korean National Arboretum. According to the information of the seed stock center, achenes of 
 <italic>B. bipinnata</italic> and 
 <italic>B. frondosa</italic> were collected from natural populations in Pocheon‐si (37° 46′ 20.057″ N, 127° 9′ 56.314″ E), and 
 <italic>B. pilosa</italic> were collected in Seogwipo‐si, Korea (33° 14′ 43.062″ N, 126° 24′ 40.24″ E) in 2014. Since we used field‐collected achenes for this study, maternal effects might influence the results. However, our primary objective is comparing trait expressions between species, and maternal effects likely have limited effects on the species‐level comparisons.
