0: We examined two alien ( B. frondosa,  B. pilosa) and one native  Bidens species ( B. bipinnata), Asteraceae.
1: All three species are herbaceous erect weedy species that inhabit disturbed areas or the periphery of rice fields in Korea.
2: The achenes of  B. bipinnata and  B. pilosa are oblongshaped with three to four barbed awns, but that of  B. frondosa is obovateshaped with two awns.
3: The achenes used in this study were obtained from the seed stock center in the Korean National Arboretum.
4: According to the information of the seed stock center, achenes of  B. bipinnata and  B. frondosa were collected from natural populations in Pocheonsi (37 46 20.057 N, 127 9 56.314 E), and  B. pilosa were collected in Seogwiposi, Korea (33 14 43.062 N, 126 24 40.24 E) in 2014.
5: Since we used fieldcollected achenes for this study, maternal effects might influence the results.
6: However, our primary objective is comparing trait expressions between species, and maternal effects likely have limited effects on the specieslevel comparisons.
