0: Traits associated with resource capture ability are highly plastic to environmental conditions, particularly resource availability (Davidson et al.,  2011; Funk,  2008; Gioria & Osborne,  2014; Godoy et al.,  2012).
1: Invasive plants tend to exhibit higher phenotypic plasticity than noninvasive plants, contributing to their establishment in novel environments and competition with existing vegetation (Davidson et al.,  2011).
2: Given the ecological significance of plasticity in invasive success, phenotypic plasticity to anthropogenic environmental change is of particular interest for the prediction of the future dynamics of plant invasion.
3: Human activities continue to increase disturbance and eutrophication in terrestrial habitats, both of which are thought to facilitate the invasion of alien plant species (Chytry et al.,  2008; Davis et al.,  2000; Jauni et al.,  2015).
4: Disturbance removes competing species, consequently decreasing biotic interactions between species while increasing soil nutrient availability.
5: Though plant responses to nutrient availability are widely studied, little information is available on phenotypic plasticity to environmental disturbance (Gioria & Osborne,  2014).
