0: Here, we examined the phenotypic expression of native and alien  Bidens species in response to nutrient availability and disturbance.
1: Specifically, the following questions were addressed: (a) Do native, noninvasive, and invasive alien  Bidens species exhibit differential morphological and functional traits?
2: (b) Do  Bidens species respond differently to fertilization and competition treatments?
3: (c) Does invasive  Bidens species have morphological characteristics that better facilitate longdistance dispersal compared to noninvasive species?
