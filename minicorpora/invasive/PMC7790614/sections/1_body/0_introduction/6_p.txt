0: Bidens bipinnata is native to East Asia (Wang et al.,  2017).
1: B. frondosa, which originated in North America, and  B. pilosa, originated in tropical America, have been reported in the Korean Peninsula since 1964 (Park et al.,  2002).
2: B. frondosa occurs throughout South Korea, but  B. pilosa is mainly found near the coastal area, especially around major harbors of South Korea (Figure  1) (Korea National Arboretum,  2016).
3: We treated  B. pilosa as a noninvasive alien in this study because its distribution is restricted to the candidate origin of introduction despite the maintenance of natural populations (Blackburn et al.,  2011; Mathakutha et al.,  2019).
4: Achenes of  Bidens species have pappi that consist of two to three barbed awns that facilitate adhesive dispersal (Sorensen,  1986).
5: Since plant species with smaller seed sizes or longer awns tend to have a higher probability of remaining attached to animal fur (Ansong & Pickering,  2014; Kiviniemi & Telenius,  1998), both achene size and pappus length in  Bidens species likely affect dispersal efficiency (Rocha,  1996).
