<p>Here, we examined the phenotypic expression of native and alien 
 <italic>Bidens</italic> species in response to nutrient availability and disturbance. Specifically, the following questions were addressed: (a) Do native, noninvasive, and invasive alien 
 <italic>Bidens</italic> species exhibit differential morphological and functional traits? (b) Do 
 <italic>Bidens</italic> species respond differently to fertilization and competition treatments? (c) Does invasive 
 <italic>Bidens</italic> species have morphological characteristics that better facilitate long‚Äêdistance dispersal compared to noninvasive species?
