0: Invasive plant species have been hypothesized to possess a suite of traits associated with successful invasion into areas in which they are introduced (van Kleunen et al.,  2010; Rejmanek & Richardson,  1996).
1: For instance, invasive species often have functional traits that confer greater resource capture ability, such as larger specific leaf areas (SLA) and smaller roottoshoot ratios (R/S ratios) (Ehrenfeld,  2003; Grotkopp & Rejmanek,  2007).
2: These traits result in faster growth rates and higher reproductive outputs of invasive species than those in native or noninvasive alien species (Mathakutha et al.,  2019).
3: Although the contribution of such traits to invasive success depends on the ecological context (Catford et al.,  2009), an investigation of trait variations between invasive and noninvasive plants is a first step in identifying candidate invasive alien species for weedrisk assessments and in formulating an traitbased predictions to invasiveness (Gallagher et al.,  2014; van Kleunen et al.,  2015; Mathakutha et al.,  2019).
