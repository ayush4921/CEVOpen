0: The comparison between native and invasive plant species is a widely adopted method to infer traits that determine invasive success.
1: However, the information gleaned often seems inadequate to evaluate attributes of invasive species (van Kleunen et al.,  2015).
2: First, the choice of a target native species is critical, because a comparison between invasive and cooccurring native species with different life cycles is likely to yield misleading results (Daehler,  2003; Vila & Weiner,  2004).
3: In addition, a comparison between invasive and noninvasive alien species would be more appropriate to identify traits contributing to invasive success (van Kleunen, Dawson, et al.,  2010).
4: A comparative study considering invasive, noninvasive alien, and native plant species, all of which are congenic, is required to gain insight into the traits that determine invasiveness.
