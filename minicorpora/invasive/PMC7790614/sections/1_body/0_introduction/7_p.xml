<p>Phenotypic plasticity is defined as the differential phenotypic expression of a genotype in response to environmental factors, so an experimental study using clonal replicates is ideal for examining phenotypic plasticity (Pigliucci, 
 <xref rid="ece37071-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>). However, ecological studies often evaluate plasticity at the population or species level by comparing the average trait value of a population or species between environmental treatments (Davidson et al.,

 <xref rid="ece37071-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). Although the results might confound plasticity with genotypic variation between treatments, evaluation of phenotypic plasticity at the species level has an advantage of including diverse genotypes representing a species. If there is no bias in assigning individual plants to environmental treatments, plasticity at the species level can provide information on the ecological significance of plasticity in invasive species (Davidson et al.,
