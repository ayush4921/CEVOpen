0: Consequently, optimization-based surveillance planning has emerged as a sub-discipline of invasive species post-border response.
1: Modern optimization techniques facilitate surveillance planning that accounts for the biology and behavior of an invader while comparing multiple scenarios to identify the most cost-effective options.
2: Indeed, improvements in computational methods and resources have made it possible to find optimal solutions using complex models with varied formulations and objectives.
3: In the next section of this review, we outline some recent advances in the application of optimization models for post-border surveillance planning.
4: In subsequent sections, we consider the extent to which current optimization approaches capture the many real-world limitations faced by survey managers in the field.
5: We also describe an example of optimization for a multi-day surveillance campaign that incorporates an array of practical constraints.
