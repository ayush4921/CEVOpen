0: Risk-based surveillance is a key element of plant biosecurity.
1: Surveillance activities for invasive alien species that are harmful to plants  primarily insects, plant pathogens and weeds  take place in border (or possibly pre-border) and post-border contexts [ 1, 2].
2: The objective of border surveillance is to intercept these invaders at the introduction or transport stage [ 3], before they can become established in novel environments [ 4, 5].
3: Ordinarily, surveillance effort is targeted at or near ports of entry [ 2], as international trade and travel account for a large share of global species movements [ 2, 69].
4: The detection methods (e.g.
5: trapping or container inspections) and degree of effort applied in these locations is determined through the pest risk analysis (PRA) process, which identifies high-risk organisms as well as the commodity and geographic pathways by which they are most likely transported [ 2, 9, 10].
6: As with all biosecurity activities, adopting a risk basis for border surveillance decisions is critical due to the huge number of potential species introductions and limited resources to perform surveillance [ 3, 6, 7, 9, 1113].
