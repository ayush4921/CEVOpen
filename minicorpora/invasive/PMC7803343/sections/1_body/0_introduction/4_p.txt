0: Although a risk-based approach confers efficiency by narrowing the survey sampling frame, there is the separate issue of cost, which dictates what is feasible when developing a surveillance system [ 42].
1: An ideal system ensures reliable discovery of an invader soon after its arrival in an area of interest.
2: Unfortunately, incipient populations are notoriously difficult to find [ 43, 44].
3: As a practical matter, no detection methods are perfect, and more effective detection methods are usually more expensive to implement [ 38, 39, 45, 46].
4: Even when detection is highly reliable, it is inefficient to survey everywhere across all areas at risk with the same degree of effort, since invasions rarely progress across a landscape in uniform fashion [ 39, 41].
5: Moreover, surveillance is merely one element of post-border response to invasions; regularly, decision-makers must assess the trade-offs of devoting limited resources to surveillance instead of other management efforts [ 4750].
