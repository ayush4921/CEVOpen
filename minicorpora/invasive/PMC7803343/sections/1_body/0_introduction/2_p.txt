0: Because of the high volume of introductions and the inevitability of detection failures, even under the best of circumstances, some pests will make it across the border and establish populations [ 14].
1: This necessitates post-border surveillance, which is the focus of this review.
2: Post-border surveillance centers on the idea of early detection [ 1519].
3: The fundamental goal of early detection is to find invasive species populations before they are too large to eradicate [ 3, 4, 10, 16, 2025].
4: Besides increasing the likelihood of eradication success, early detection can help to minimize further spread and limit the costs of response measures, such as deployment of biological control [ 5, 8, 17, 21, 23, 2527].
5: There are some practical differences between the three main types of post-border surveillance: detection surveys, which are focused on discovering an invader as soon as possible so that survey attention can be shifted to other locations under threat [ 14, 19]; delimiting surveys, which are intended to find the full extent of a pest population in an invaded area to facilitate response planning [ 1, 2831]; and proof of freedom' surveys to substantiate that a pest is not present in an area of concern [ 1, 32].
6: However, the three types are conceptually similar in that they prioritize rapid discovery (or instead, rapid confirmation of absence) as a means to lessen the impact of an invasive species [ 28].
7: Arguably, the main difference between these types of surveys is the scale of the required sampling effort.
