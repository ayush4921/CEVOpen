<p>Because of the high volume of introductions and the inevitability of detection failures, even under the best of circumstances, some pests will make it across the border and establish populations [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-513C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This necessitates post-border surveillance, which is the focus of this review. Post-border surveillance centers on the idea of early detection [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-513C15" ref-type="bibr">15–19</xref>]. The fundamental goal of early detection is to find invasive species populations before they are too large to eradicate [

 <xref rid="ETLS-4-513C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-513C20" ref-type="bibr">20–25</xref>]. Besides increasing the likelihood of eradication success, early detection can help to minimize further spread and limit the costs of response measures, such as deployment of biological control [

 <xref rid="ETLS-4-513C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,

 <xref rid="ETLS-4-513C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-513C25" ref-type="bibr">25–27</xref>]. There are some practical differences between the three main types of post-border surveillance: detection surveys, which are focused on discovering an invader as soon as possible so that survey attention can be shifted to other locations under threat [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-513C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-513C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]; delimiting surveys, which are intended to find the full extent of a pest population in an invaded area to facilitate response planning [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-513C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-513C28" ref-type="bibr">28–31</xref>]; and ‘proof of freedom' surveys to substantiate that a pest is not present in an area of concern [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-513C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-513C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, the three types are conceptually similar in that they prioritize rapid discovery (or instead, rapid confirmation of absence) as a means to lessen the impact of an invasive species [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-513C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Arguably, the main difference between these types of surveys is the scale of the required sampling effort.
