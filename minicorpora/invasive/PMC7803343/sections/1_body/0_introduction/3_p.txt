0: Regardless, a well-devised, risk-based strategy is crucial for post-border surveillance aimed at reliable and timely detection.
1: Risk-based strategies account for variability between potentially invaded locations in terms of a number of relevant criteria, including environmental suitability (e.g.
2: climatic conditions), host availability and the predicted geographic distribution of the invading species [ 3, 29, 30, 33, 34]; more sophisticated strategies account for aspects such as a species expected pattern of spread, including through spatial networks [ 3537], or the consequences of imperfect detection tools [ 38, 39].
3: Typically, knowledge about these risk criteria is uncertain, especially for newly recorded and therefore poorly understood invasive species [ 2830, 40].
4: Nevertheless, there are usually enough data (i.e.
5: spatial data) describing the criteria to design surveys that are far more efficient than schemes that rely heavily on uniform or random sampling [ 30, 33, 41].
