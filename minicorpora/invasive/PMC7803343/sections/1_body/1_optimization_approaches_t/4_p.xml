<p>Optimization approaches may also be used to elucidate the factors that most influence the invasion process or may otherwise affect the likelihood of successful detection. For instance, an analysis of the potential spread of the pathogen 
 <italic>Xylella fastidiosa</italic> in France [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-513C65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] identified the primary drivers of infection and incorporated them into a network simulation model, which provided a basis for comparing the performance of several surveillance strategies. Another study of the citrus disease huanglongbing (caused by 
 <italic>Candidatus</italic> Liberibacter asiaticus) in the United States [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-513C66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] evaluated the distribution of surveillance resources as an optimization problem. The researchers found that the sensitivity of available detection methods affected the optimal arrangement of survey sites. The latter study is a relevant example of the capacity to address a practical surveillance concern (i.e. detection sensitivity) through optimization.
