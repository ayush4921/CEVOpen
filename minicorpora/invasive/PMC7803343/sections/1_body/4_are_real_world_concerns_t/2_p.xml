<p>In the absence of guidance from researchers, survey managers must rely on their own judgments and experience when implementing the surveys. This is a sensible approach, but the complexity of the multi-day surveillance problem can cause managers to overlook relevant details, such that the campaign is not truly cost-effective. There is also some risk that adjustments made in the field alter the campaign in some meaningful way, but those changes are not reported to the researcher who performed the optimization; in turn, the researcher cannot evaluate their impacts on the optimal prescriptions. We recognize that some day-to-day considerations (e.g. the effects of weather on site visit times and travel times) are difficult, if not impossible, to integrate into optimization models. Nevertheless, we contend that relieving some of the decision-making pressure on a survey manager increases the chance of a successful campaign.</p>
