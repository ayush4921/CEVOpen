<p>In our view, accounting for logistical and operational constraints during optimization is crucial to planning productive multi-day surveillance. Adding these constraints to an optimization-based model will restrict the scope and extent of the cost-effective surveillance actions, and so will produce prescriptions that appear less effective than theoretical model solutions that do not account for the constraints. However, these prescriptions will offer more realistic expectations of the surveillance outcomes, which ultimately helps to protect the credibility of the surveillance plan as well as the integrity of the results.</p>
