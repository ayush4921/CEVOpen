<p>Urban areas with high human population density appear to have been hardest hit by the SARS- CoV-2 pandemic [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-539C47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. It is expected that the urbanisation of rural regions and the increasing growth of megacities is likely to lead to a heightened risk of pest and disease incursions as well as the emergence of new zoonoses due to the increasing interaction of urban communities with invasive alien species. Human dominated ecosystems, such as urban regions, host a greater diversity of zoonotic host species [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-539C48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. As a consequence, urban development is one of the main drivers of disease spillover from wildlife to humans and domestic animals, but also from domestic animals to wildlife [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-539C49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Furthermore, alien species comprise an increasingly significant proportion of biodiversity in urban ecosystems [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-539C50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Many alien bird and mammal species in urban environments have zoonotic potential [
 <xref rid="ETLS-4-539C51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and this indicates a potential for high rates of transmission either directly to humans or via domesticated animals. Yet for most vertebrates introduced around the world, their effectiveness as reservoir hosts of zoonotic pathogens is unknown. This represents a significant gap in the management of future zoonotic risk.
