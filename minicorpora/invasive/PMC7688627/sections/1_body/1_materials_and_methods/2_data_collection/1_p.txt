0: Field investigations were performed in the LTDB in July 2010, August 2014, and from June to October 2018.
1: We did not use snorkels or scubas or other professional diving equipment during our investigation.
2: Fortunately, the ponds, lakes, channels, or rivers in our investigations are not deep.
3: For example, the average depth of the largest lake in the LTDB, Lake Taihu, is only 1.9 m, allowing us to use free-diving to conduct our investigation without rakes to minimize sampling errors.
4: The sampling quadrats were randomly selected, with an area of 1  1 m 2, and were approximately 5 km apart ( Figure 1).
5: Handheld GPS recorders were used to capture location coordinates (longitudes, latitudes, and elevations) in the field investigations.
6: Location information, water properties, habitat types, and surrounding terrestrial vegetation types were recorded.
7: Plant specimens were collected, classified, and then identified according to the  Flora of China.
8: The number of each dominant and companion plant species was counted.
9: Water quality indicators including the pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and salinity were determined by a YSI multiparameter water quality analyzer (YSI Inc., Yellow Springs, OH, United States).
10: The sample information is listed in the  Supplementary Material.
