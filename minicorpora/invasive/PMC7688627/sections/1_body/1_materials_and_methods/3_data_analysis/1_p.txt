0: The data were tested to meet the assumptions of a normal distribution and homoscedasticity of variances before the statistical analysis, and these assumptions were verified by the ShapiroWilk test and Levenes test, respectively.
1: A one-way analysis of variance was used to examine differences ( P = 0.05) in plant biodiversity indices among the years 2010, 2014, and 2018.
2: Simple linear regression models were constructed to analyze the relationships among the year, plant biodiversity indices, population, and GDP.
3: Multiple regression models were constructed to analyze the relationships among plant biodiversity indices and the coverage of two invasive plants,  E. crassipes and  Ca.
4: caroliniana.
5: Statistical analyses were conducted in SPSS Statistics 19 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, United States).
6: Mapping was performed in ArcGIS 10.3 (Esri Corp., Redlands, CA, United States).
