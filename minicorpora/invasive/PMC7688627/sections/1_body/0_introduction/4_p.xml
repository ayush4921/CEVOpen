<p>In this study, the biodiversity and distributions of native and introduced aquatic plants in the LTDB 
 <italic>in situ</italic> were obtained through field investigations in 2010, 2014, and 2018. We aimed to address the 
 <italic>status quo</italic> of invasive aquatic plants in the LTDB and to help develop reasonable means to control invasive plants in China. Three issues are discussed: (1) the identification of aquatic plants with a dominant role in the LTDB; (2) the relationships among aquatic plant biodiversity indices, the human population, and the economy; and (3) possible control methods for invasive plants in the LTDB.
