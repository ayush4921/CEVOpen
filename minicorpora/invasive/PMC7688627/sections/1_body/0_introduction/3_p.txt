0: In the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services  Global Assessment Report, invasive species were identified as one of the top five global factors driving negative changes in natural habitats around the world.
1: Although biological invasion is a natural process, it is intensified by human activities.
2: Especially in modern times, biological invasion has become more frequent and complicated due to international trade, horticulture, immigration, and other cultural and commercial exchanges ( Nentwig, 2008a).
3: Economic damage caused by invasive species accounts for approximately 5% of the worlds gross national product (GNP) ( Pimentel et al., 2008).
4: In recent years, biological invasions have become increasingly severe in China ( Feng and Zhu, 2010;  Wu and Ding, 2019).
5: As the worlds largest import and export country, Chinas trade activities have increased considerably since the 1980s ( WTO, 2017).
6: The trade link between China and the world is becoming tighter than ever before, and trade can introduce commercial, ornamental, and non-native species accidentally or deliberately ( Nentwig, 2008b).
7: Coupled with the high diversity of Chinas ecosystems, it is more conducive to the invasion and spread of introduced species, which also renders China one of the most seriously endangered places.
