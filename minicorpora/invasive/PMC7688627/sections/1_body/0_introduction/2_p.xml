<p>As primary producers of trophic chains, aquatic plants provide food and shelter for fishes. Additionally, aquatic plants provide breeding grounds for benthic organisms (

 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Owing to the flourishment of aquarium markets, many introduced ornamental plants are imported and sold in China without undergoing environmental impact assessments, and these activities also contribute to the spread of introduced plants (

 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2011</xref>). However, synchronal 
 <italic>in situ</italic> studies on both native and introduced invasive species have received little attention in this area. On the basis of previous investigations, the main invasive plants in Lake Taihu are water hyacinth (
 <italic>Eichhornia crassipes</italic>) and alligator weed (
 <italic>Alternanthera philoxeroides</italic>). A new invasive plant, Carolina fanwort (
 <italic>Cabomba caroliniana</italic>), has recently received considerable amounts of attention. An introduced plant species, but one not listed as an invasive plant, called parrotâ€™s feather (
 <italic>Myriophyllum aquaticum</italic>) was also found in the LTDB.
