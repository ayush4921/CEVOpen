0: In this study, the biodiversity and distributions of native and introduced aquatic plants in the LTDB  in situ were obtained through field investigations in 2010, 2014, and 2018.
1: We aimed to address the  status quo of invasive aquatic plants in the LTDB and to help develop reasonable means to control invasive plants in China.
2: Three issues are discussed: (1) the identification of aquatic plants with a dominant role in the LTDB; (2) the relationships among aquatic plant biodiversity indices, the human population, and the economy; and (3) possible control methods for invasive plants in the LTDB.
