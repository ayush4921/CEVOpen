<p>In the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services 
 <italic>Global Assessment Report</italic>, invasive species were identified as one of the top five global factors driving negative changes in natural habitats around the world. Although biological invasion is a natural process, it is intensified by human activities. Especially in modern times, biological invasion has become more frequent and complicated due to international trade, horticulture, immigration, and other cultural and commercial exchanges (
