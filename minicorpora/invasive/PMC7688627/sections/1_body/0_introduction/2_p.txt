0: As primary producers of trophic chains, aquatic plants provide food and shelter for fishes.
1: Additionally, aquatic plants provide breeding grounds for benthic organisms ( Bornette and Puijalon, 2011).
2: Losses and declines in native aquatic vegetation in the LTDB have prompted extensive concerns ( Gao et al., 2017;  Zhang et al., 2017).
3: Owing to the flourishment of aquarium markets, many introduced ornamental plants are imported and sold in China without undergoing environmental impact assessments, and these activities also contribute to the spread of introduced plants ( Xu et al., 2006;  Jiang et al., 2011).
4: However, synchronal  in situ studies on both native and introduced invasive species have received little attention in this area.
5: On the basis of previous investigations, the main invasive plants in Lake Taihu are water hyacinth ( Eichhornia crassipes) and alligator weed ( Alternanthera philoxeroides).
6: A new invasive plant, Carolina fanwort ( Cabomba caroliniana), has recently received considerable amounts of attention.
7: An introduced plant species, but one not listed as an invasive plant, called parrots feather ( Myriophyllum aquaticum) was also found in the LTDB.
