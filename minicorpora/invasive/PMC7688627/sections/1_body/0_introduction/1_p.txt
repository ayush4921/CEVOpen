0: Aquatic ecosystems provide irreplaceable economic and cultural services to human societies and are currently experiencing more significant loss compared to terrestrial ecosystems ( Dudgeon et al., 2006).
1: Most shallow lakes (<7 m) with water turnover rates of less than one year are essential components of the freshwater ecosystem ( Ji, 2008).
2: Currently, lakes in China are facing a series of ecological and environmental problems, such as water area loss, the fragmentation of lake ecosystems, a decline in biodiversity, and the weakening of ecological functions.
3: Anthropogenic influences (including water pollution, diking, draining, and conversion to agricultural or urban use) have caused the degradation of many shallow lakes ( Fang et al., 2006;  An et al., 2013).
4: Lake Taihu has been viewed as a model shallow lake in China ( Qin, 2008;  Hu, 2016).
5: Many articles on the transition and management of aquatic plants in this lake [e.g.,  Zhang et al.
6: (2018), and  Wang et al.
7: (2019)] have been published.
8: However, direct evidence of the transformation of dominant aquatic plants and aquatic plant diversity in the Lake Taihu drainage basin (LTDB) is rare because of the lack of long-term field observations.
9: Located downstream of the Yangtze River Delta, which is one of the most developed and populated areas in China, the Taihu Basin occupies only 1% (36,900 km 2) of the total territorial area but encompassed 4.4% (60.58 million) of the total population and contributed 9.8% [8,081.5 billion renminbi (RMB, the official currency of China)] of the gross domestic product (GDP) of China in 2017 ( Taihu Basin Authority TBA, 2017;  Zhang et al., 2018).
10: A serious eutrophication trend has been detected in this area, and some lakes have transformed from being dominated by submerged vegetation to being dominated by algae, indicating this area is an environmentally sensitive area ( Mitsch and Gosselink, 2011;  Zhang et al., 2017;  Wang et al., 2019).
11: Moreover, studies on invasive aquatic plants have received little attention, although many field investigations on aquatic plants have been conducted in this area.
12: Remote sensing has been widely used for the recognition of aquatic plants, but distinguishing distinct aquatic plants  via this method is challenging ( Liu et al., 2015).
13: Traditional field investigations are thus still indispensable.
