<p>In this study, we found that the total numbers of aquatic plants in 2010, 2014, and 2018 in the LTDB did not have a significant change, but the aquatic plant vegetation has transformed from being dominated by the native plant 
 <italic>Cer. demersum</italic> to being dominated by the invasive plants 
 <italic>Ca. caroliniana</italic> and 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> in the aquatic sampling plots. Aquatic plant biodiversity showed a decreasing trend, which may reduce the freshwater ecosystem function, and anthropogenic activities were responsible for these changes. This transformation may cause declines in native species and the extinction of narrowly distributed species, as invasive species typically have advantageous traits that facilitate their competitiveness with native species, and they are more tolerant of eutrophication and other human pollution, often being able to survive habitat disturbances to become dominant species (
