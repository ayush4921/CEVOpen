<p>The invasive species in this study exhibited higher values of SLA, on average, than did their congeneric naturalized relatives. Evidence suggests that SLA is highly influential in the invasion process (Baruch &amp; Goldstein

 <xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Although multivariate studies show that traits such as growth form, flowering season, height, and native range size are associated with the probability of progressing through the invasion continuum (Gravuer et al.

 <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Milbau &amp; Scott 
 <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Bucharova &amp; Van Kleunen 
 <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), no one has investigated the role of SLA. This omission likely reflects a lack of available comparative data for this trait or the time-consuming nature of its collection in the field.
