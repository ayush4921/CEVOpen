<p>The breadth of abiotic conditions species can tolerate sets the limits of their fundamental niche (Crawley 
 <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). Subsequently, species with greater niche breadth for climatic factors such as temperature and precipitation are able to occupy a wider range of environments. The ecological versatility associated with wide climatic niches allows introduced species to more readily colonize and spread in novel areas outside their historical biogeographic limits (Pyšek &amp; Richardson 
 <xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Gravuer et al. 
 <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Our results support the idea that wide climatic niches in the native range are a common feature of successful invaders, and this idea can be used to distinguish this group of plants from naturalized species along the invasion continuum. In addition, we found that invasive species occupied a greater number of biomes, which is an integrated measure of species’ tolerance to biotic and abiotic factors, in their native range than did naturalized species. Species capable of occurring a wider range of ecological settings (across multiple biomes) are more likely to go on to become invasive than other introduced plants in the continental species pool.
