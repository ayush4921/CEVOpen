<p>Maximum height was also a correlate of invasion success in species introduced to Australia. The maximum height a species can reach in a canopy is a key indicator of light capture strategy and competitive ability (Grime et al. 
 <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>). Plants that are able to shade out their competitors will secure more of the light available for photosynthesis; however, this strategy requires greater investment in carbon-rich support tissues, such as stems and branches. For invasive species, the ability to monopolize the light environment by shading out competing vegetation suppresses the growth and fecundity of co-occurring native species (Galbraith-Kent &amp; Handel 
 <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Hejda et al. 
 <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). In addition, increased plant height has been positively associated with the naturalization success of North American woody species in Europe in multivariate studies (Bucharova &amp; Van Kleunen 
 <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Urgenson et al. 
 <xref rid="b52" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and with higher population spread rates of invaders (Jongejans et al. 
 <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). However, height has not emerged as a significant variable in other multivariate investigations of the correlates of invasion (e.g., Milbau &amp; Stout 
 <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Gallagher et al. 
 <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Gallagher et al. (
 <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) studied trait patterning in a single clade; however, we found consistent differences in height across a number of growth forms and in species that colonize a range of landscapes. Although comparing traits among all species within a single highly invasive clade (e.g.,

 <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; 
 <italic>Pinus</italic>: Grotkopp et al. 
 <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>) has previously provided insights into correlates of invasion success, this approach may lack generalizability across growth forms and taxonomic groups.
