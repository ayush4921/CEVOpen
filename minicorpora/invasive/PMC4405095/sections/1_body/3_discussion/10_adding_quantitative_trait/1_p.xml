<p>Our findings may inform WRA protocols that seek to distinguish between successful and unsuccessful introductions on the basis of the physical and biogeographic characteristics of species (Hulme 
 <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The 6 traits that distinguish naturalized and invasive species in our study are relatively easy and cost-effective to measure for large numbers of species; much information is already available in global databases and published floras. In particular, we encourage the addition of SLA into preborder screening procedures for plants. This trait has consistently been identified as a correlate of invasiveness in both experimental and field-based studies and would provide an informative quantitative surrogate for growth rates in comparisons among species. Quantitative estimates of growth rate would be a useful complement to qualitative questions about growth dynamics that currently feature in many WRA schemes.
