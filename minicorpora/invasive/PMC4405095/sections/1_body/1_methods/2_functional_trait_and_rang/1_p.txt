0: We collated data on 5 functional traits (flowering duration, leaf size, maximum height, seed mass, SLA) and 3 native range characteristics (mean annual temperature range, mean annual precipitation range, biome occupancy) (hereafter referred to collectively as traits) (Table  1).
1: These traits were chosen because they have been associated previously with invasion success in introduced plants (Reichard & Hamilton  1997; Lake & Leishman  2004; Van Kluenen et al.
2: 2010; Gallagher et al.
3: 2011; Gibson et al.
4: 2011) but not used to specifically test for differences in naturalized and invasive species.
