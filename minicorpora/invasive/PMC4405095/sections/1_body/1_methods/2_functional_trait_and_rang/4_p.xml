<p>There are some limitations to our approach and to the data sets we compiled. First, although we have taken time since introduction into Australia into account, no comprehensive data exists on introduction effort for these taxa on this continent. Although a lack of data on introduction effort does not invalidate our results, their inclusion could provide further insights into invasion success (Bucharova &amp; Van Kleunen 
 <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), particularly on the impact of species that are planted widely as fodder crops throughout Australia, such as 
 <italic>Pennisetum ciliaris</italic> (buffell grass). Second, although we analyzed mean trait values for species to test for correlates of invasion success, we acknowledge that functional traits do vary within species. Plasticity in traits can play a role in determining impact in specific environmental contexts, but it is not likely to have affected our results because variance around trait measurements did not significantly differ between naturalized and invasive species in a preliminary analyses (data not shown). Finally, the use of aggregated global data sets for compiling functional trait information means that data for individual species may have been collected in either the native or exotic range. Although ideally trait data would have been collected solely in the exotic Australian range, this was not feasible for a comparative study of this size, and we see no a priori reason why any differences in trait data between native and exotic ranges would affect naturalized species any more than invasive species in this study.
