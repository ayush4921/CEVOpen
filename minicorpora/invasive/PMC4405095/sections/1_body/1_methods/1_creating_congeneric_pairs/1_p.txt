0: We used a comprehensive data set of the introduced flora of Australiaan updated version of Randall ( 2007) containing unpublished datato create a preliminary list of all species that have been recorded as being either naturalized ( n = 3296 species; self-sustaining populations that have not spread in the landscape) or invasive (invasive:  n = 253 species; spreading into and outcompeting native vegetation).
1: This list has been used in previous studies on the naturalizationinvasion transition in Australian flora (Phillips et al.
2: 2010; Diez et al.
3: 2012;  Duursma et al.
4: 2013) and is considered an authoritative source of information on invasion stage for introduced species.
5: The term  invasive is only applied to serious high impact environmental or agricultural weeds (Randall  2007).
