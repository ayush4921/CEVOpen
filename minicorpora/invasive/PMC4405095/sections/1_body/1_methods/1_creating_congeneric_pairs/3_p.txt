0: Using these data, we identified 146 congeneric pairs for analyses.
1: Wherever possible, pairings were made between species with differences in MRT of 10 years (61 pairs).
2: However, to increase our sample size for comparative analyses, we allowed a difference in MRT of up to 35 years for the remaining congeneric pairs (85 pairs).
3: We chose 35 years as a maximum difference based on the findings of a previous study (Phillips et al.
4: 2010), which showed that although invasive species, on average, have significantly longer MRTs in Australia than naturalized species, this mean difference in MRT did not exceed 35 years.
5: All species pairs and their residence times are provided in Supporting Information.
6: Pairs represented a range of functional groups (16 climbers, 29 grasses, 44 herbs, and 57 trees or shrubs) with growth form consistent within congeneric pairings so that we were not making comparisons between, for example, a tree and a grass.
7: The data set included species from 32 families and 68 genera.
