<p>We used a comprehensive data set of the introduced flora of Australia—an updated version of Randall (
 <xref rid="b45" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) containing unpublished data—to create a preliminary list of all species that have been recorded as being either naturalized (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3296 species; self-sustaining populations that have not spread in the landscape) or invasive (invasive: 
 <italic>n</italic> = 253 species; spreading into and outcompeting native vegetation). This list has been used in previous studies on the naturalization–invasion transition in Australian flora (Phillips et al. 
 <xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Diez et al. 
 <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="b56" ref-type="bibr">Duursma et al. 2013</xref>) and is considered an authoritative source of information on invasion stage for introduced species. The term 
 <italic>invasive</italic> is only applied to serious high impact environmental or agricultural weeds (Randall 
 <xref rid="b45" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>).
