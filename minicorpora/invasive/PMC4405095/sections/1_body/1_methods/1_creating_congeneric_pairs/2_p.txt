0: We paired congeneric naturalized and invasive species on the basis of their estimated minimum residence time (MRT) in Australia.
1: We estimated an MRT (length of time each species has been present) from 2 sources: the year in which the first herbarium specimen was collected and the year in which the species was first imported for sale.
2: Herbarium records were from Australia's Virtual Herbarium ( http://avh.chah.org.au/), and data on the importation of exotic species for sale in Australia were taken from commercial nursery catalogues (R. Ingram, personal communication).
