0: It was not possible to conduct multivariate analyses on the data set due to a large number of missing values when all speciestrait combinations were combined in a single matrix.
1: That is, only 11 congeneric pairings of the 145 potential pairings had data available for all 8 traits examined.
2: Although some traits (e.g., leaf size, SLA) may be relatively easy to collect in local populations many species occur only in relatively remote or disparate locations across Australia, which made this type of collection logistically unfeasible for us.
