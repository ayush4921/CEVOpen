0: We used a series of one-tailed, paired  t tests to quantify differences in trait values between naturalized and invasive congeneric pairs with similar residence times.
1: One-tailed tests were chosen because our hypotheses were based on a priori assumptions about the direction of trait differences, such as invaders possessing higher SLA, or being taller on average, relative to their congeneric naturalized equivalent (Table  1).
2: All traits except flowering duration and biome occupancy were log 10 transformed before analysis to reduce skew in the raw data.
3: Each naturalized and invasive species was used in only one congeneric pairing for any given trait; however, some pairings were used in more than one analysis across the 8 traits examined (Supporting Information).
