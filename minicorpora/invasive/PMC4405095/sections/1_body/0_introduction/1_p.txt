0: Why do some species become invasive when introduced to a novel environment, whereas others remain naturalized?
1: This deceptively simple question lies at the heart of invasion science and is crucial in weed risk assessment (WRA), yet it lacks a comprehensive empirical answer.
2: Since the 1990s progress toward understanding the invasion continuum (sensu Richardson et al.
3: 2000) has largely been made by examining invasion correlates, such as propagule pressure (Lockwood et al.
4: 2005), residence time (Wilson et al.
5: 2007), phylogeny (Duncan & Williams  2002; Diez et al.
6: 2008; Proches et al.
7: 2008), and species traits and biogeography (Pysek & Richardson  2006; Leishman et al.
8: 2007; Van Kluenen et al.
9: 2010) in isolation, rather than together in a single analysis.
10: As a result, robust conclusions about which species will make the shift from naturalized to invasive, and why, remain somewhat elusive (but see Milbau & Stout  2008; Dawson et al.
11: 2009).
12: In particular, studies that explicitly compare the traits of species which have become serious invaders with those that remain naturalized (i.e., self-sustaining populations which are yet to spread) are lacking, despite the insights that such comparisons may provide into this critical transition along the invasion continuum.
