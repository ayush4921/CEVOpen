0: We used pairs of closely related species with similar residence times in Australia to identify traits and range characteristics correlated with invasion success and examined how our results could be integrated into the WRA process.
1: The invasion continuum has 3 stages: introduction, naturalization, and invasion and spread.
2: Around 10% of all alien plant species introduced beyond their native range will naturalize (i.e., form self-sustaining populations in the landscape) (Richardson & Pysek  2012).
3: From this pool of naturalized plants approximately one-tenth will go on to become serious invaders capable of rapid spread and displacement of native species.
