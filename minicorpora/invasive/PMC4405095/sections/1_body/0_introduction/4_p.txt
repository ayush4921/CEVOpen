0: Although a number of studies have shown the importance of residence time and phylogeny in the naturalization-invasion transition (Diez et al.
1: 2008; Proches et al.
2: 2008; Trueman et al.
3: 2010), less attention has been paid to the physical, phenological, physiological, and biogeographic factors (known collectively as functional traits) that affect ecological performance and if these can be effectively used to distinguish between naturalized and invasive plants.
4: We sought to identify which functional traits and range characteristics, if any, distinguish invasive and naturalized plants when residence time and phylogenetic relatedness are held relatively constant.
5: Table  1 details the ecological relevance of each trait and range characteristic examined to the invasion process and the specific hypotheses tested.
6: We focused on flowering duration, leaf size, maximum height, SLA, and seed mass because these traits have all been implicated previously in invasion success via their influential on plant strategy variation.
7: We also examined 3 macroecological characteristics of species ranges: breadth of mean annual temperature and precipitation (mm) encountered and number of biomes occupied.
8: Our main aim was to identify which of these quantitative traits, if any, correlate with invasion success and may therefore be useful for improving the predictive capacity of the WRA process.
