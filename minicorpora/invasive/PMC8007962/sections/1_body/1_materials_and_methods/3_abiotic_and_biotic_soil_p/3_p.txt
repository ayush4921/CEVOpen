0: We assessed basal respiration (l O 2 h 1 g 1 dry soil), microbial biomass (Cmic; g C g 1 dry soil), and the microbial specific respiratory quotient (qO 2; l O 2 g 1 Cmic h 1).
1: These soil microbial properties were measured with 6 g of fresh soil using an O 2-microcompensation apparatus ( Scheu, 1992).
2: The microbial respiratory response was measured every hour during 24 h at 20C.
3: We measured the respiratory response to the addition of D-Glucose (22 mg per sample added in 1.5 ml deionized water) to calculate substrate-induced respiration.
4: Microbial biomass was calculated from the maximum initial respiratory response, i.e., the lowest average respiratory response of three consecutive hourly measurements within the first 10 h after the first peak caused by the disturbance of the soil during preparation ( Beck et al., 1997).
5: The microbial specific respiratory quotient was calculated as the ratio of basal respiration to microbial biomass.
