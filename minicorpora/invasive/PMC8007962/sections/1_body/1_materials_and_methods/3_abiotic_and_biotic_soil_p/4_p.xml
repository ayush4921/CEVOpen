<p>We assessed soil microbial community structure using phospholipid fatty acid composition as described in 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Frostegård et al. (1991)</xref>. Briefly, lipids were extracted, fractionated, saponified, and methylated. Fatty acid methyl esters were then transferred into vials, capped, and stored at −20°C until analysis with a gas chromatograph (Clarus 680, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, United States; flame ionization detector; capillary column SP-2560, 100 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.2 μm film thickness; carrier gas: helium). We identified fatty acid methyl esters comparing retention times of samples with standards and quantified them calculating phospholipid fatty acid abundances (in nmol g
 <sup>–1</sup> dry weight). The entire set of phospholipid fatty acids was used in a multivariate approach to investigate microbial community structure including the biomarkers for Gram-positive bacteria (i15:0; a15:0; i16:0 and i17:0), Gram-negative bacteria (cy17:0), plants (18:1ω9), arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (16:1ω5; in neutral lipid fraction), and fungi (18:2ω6).
