<p>We assessed basal respiration (μl O
 <sub>2</sub> h
 <sup>–1</sup> g
 <sup>–1</sup> dry soil), microbial biomass (Cmic; μg C g
 <sup>–1</sup> dry soil), and the microbial specific respiratory quotient (qO
 <sub>2</sub>; μl O
 <sub>2</sub> μg
 <sup>–1</sup> Cmic h
 <sup>–1</sup>). These soil microbial properties were measured with 6 g of fresh soil using an O
 <sub>2</sub>-microcompensation apparatus (

We measured the respiratory response to the addition of D-Glucose (22 mg per sample added in 1.5 ml deionized water) to calculate substrate-induced respiration. Microbial biomass was calculated from the maximum initial respiratory response, i.e., the lowest average respiratory response of three consecutive hourly measurements within the first 10 h after the first peak caused by the disturbance of the soil during preparation (
