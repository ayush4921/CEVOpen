0: We assessed soil microbial community structure using phospholipid fatty acid composition as described in  Frostegard et al.
1: (1991).
2: Briefly, lipids were extracted, fractionated, saponified, and methylated.
3: Fatty acid methyl esters were then transferred into vials, capped, and stored at 20C until analysis with a gas chromatograph (Clarus 680, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, United States; flame ionization detector; capillary column SP-2560, 100 m  0.25 mm i.d., 0.2 m film thickness; carrier gas: helium).
4: We identified fatty acid methyl esters comparing retention times of samples with standards and quantified them calculating phospholipid fatty acid abundances (in nmol g 1 dry weight).
5: The entire set of phospholipid fatty acids was used in a multivariate approach to investigate microbial community structure including the biomarkers for Gram-positive bacteria (i15:0; a15:0; i16:0 and i17:0), Gram-negative bacteria (cy17:0), plants (18:19), arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (16:15; in neutral lipid fraction), and fungi (18:26).
