0: To record the vegetative height (cm), ten individuals per species were randomly selected for each plant pattern, in the center of the EcoUnit (i.e., to avoid potential border effects) using an R function.
1: Vegetative height was measured as the shortest distance between the soil surface and the upper part of the highest leaf of the plant ( Cornelissen et al., 2003;  Perez-Harguindeguy et al., 2016).
2: We also recorded the presence-absence of flowers as well as the number of ramets for each of these ten individuals.
3: The mean values of these two traits were calculated per species at the EcoUnit level prior to further analysis.
4: Among these ten individuals per species, five individuals were randomly selected in full light conditions to measure individual biomass and leaf traits.
5: The species-specific biomasses per EcoUnit were measured by cutting shoots at 1 cm above the soil surface.
6: Plant species-specific biomasses were dried at 60C for at least 72 h and weighed.
7: To calculate the total biomass of the plant community, we summed the dry weight of the four plant species, including the dry biomass of the individuals sampled for trait measurements.
