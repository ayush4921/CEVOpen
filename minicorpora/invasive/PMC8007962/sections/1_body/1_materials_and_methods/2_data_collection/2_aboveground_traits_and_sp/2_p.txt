0: Leaf traits, such as specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC), were measured on five leaves per individual (i.e., on the five individuals per species per EcoUnit).
1: Plant individuals were cut at the soil surface, wrapped in moist paper, and stored in sealed plastic bags in the dark in a fridge (4C) before being processed on the same day.
2: Leaves that were sampled from the top to bottom of the plant, were then swabbed using paper towels to remove any surface water, and weighed (fresh mass; g), before being scanned with an Epson Perfection 11000XL Scanner (Epson America, Inc., CA, United States) at 600 dpi in grayscale.
3: Leaves and the other biomass of individuals were then oven-dried at 60C for at least 72 h and reweighed.
4: Leaf areas were calculated using WinFOLIA software (Version: 2014a Pro; Regent Instruments Inc., Canada).
5: SLA that is related to the relative growth rate of the plant and its investment into structural tissue and leaf lifespan ( Cornelissen et al., 2003;  Perez-Harguindeguy et al., 2016), was calculated as the ratio of fresh leaf area to leaf dry mass (mm 2 mg 1).
6: LDMC was calculated as the ratio of leaf dry mass to leaf fresh mass (mg g 1) and is correlated with leaf toughness, resistance to physical hazards, digestibility, and resource-use strategy ( Wilson et al., 1999;  Cornelissen et al., 2003;  Perez-Harguindeguy et al., 2016).
7: For further statistical analyses, we used the mean values per individual of SLA and LDMC.
