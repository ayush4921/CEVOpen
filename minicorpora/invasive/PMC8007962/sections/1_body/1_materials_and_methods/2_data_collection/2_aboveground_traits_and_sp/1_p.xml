<p>To record the vegetative height (cm), ten individuals per species were randomly selected for each plant pattern, in the center of the EcoUnit (i.e., to avoid potential border effects) using an R function. Vegetative height was measured as the shortest distance between the soil surface and the upper part of the highest leaf of the plant (

The mean values of these two traits were calculated per species at the EcoUnit level prior to further analysis. Among these ten individuals per species, five individuals were randomly selected in full light conditions to measure individual biomass and leaf traits. The species-specific biomasses per EcoUnit were measured by cutting shoots at 1 cm above the soil surface. Plant species-specific biomasses were dried at 60°C for at least 72 h and weighed. To calculate the total biomass of the plant community, we summed the dry weight of the four plant species, including the dry biomass of the individuals sampled for trait measurements.
