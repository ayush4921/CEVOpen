<p>Leaf traits, such as specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC), were measured on five leaves per individual (i.e., on the five individuals per species per EcoUnit). Plant individuals were cut at the soil surface, wrapped in moist paper, and stored in sealed plastic bags in the dark in a fridge (4°C) before being processed on the same day. Leaves that were sampled from the top to bottom of the plant, were then swabbed using paper towels to remove any surface water, and weighed (fresh mass; g), before being scanned with an Epson Perfection 11000XL Scanner (Epson America, Inc., CA, United States) at 600 dpi in grayscale. Leaves and the other biomass of individuals were then oven-dried at 60°C for at least 72 h and reweighed. Leaf areas were calculated using WinFOLIA software (Version: 2014a Pro; Regent Instruments Inc., Canada). SLA that is related to the relative growth rate of the plant and its investment into structural tissue and leaf lifespan (

 <sup>–1</sup>) and is correlated with leaf toughness, resistance to physical hazards, digestibility, and resource-use strategy (
