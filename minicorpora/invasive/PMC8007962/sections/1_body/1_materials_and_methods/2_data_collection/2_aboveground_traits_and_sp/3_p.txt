0: Leaf carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents were measured on three individuals per species per EcoUnit.
1: Leaf C concentration is related to plant photosynthetic rates and to the amount of structural tissues, while leaf N content is correlated with the N available in the environment and indicates the nutritional quality of the plant ( Cornelissen et al., 2003;  Perez-Harguindeguy et al., 2016).
2: Leaves of each individual used for SLA and LDMC measurements were pooled and dried (60C for at least 72 h).
3: Each pool was then ground individually, and around 1 mg of the ground material per sample was used to measure nutrient concentrations (% dry-leaf mass) and  15N signatures (atom ) using dry combustion with an elemental analyzer (Euro EA 3000, EuroVector S.p.A; Milano Italy) coupled to a Thermo Delta Vplus isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Electron, Bremen, Germany).
