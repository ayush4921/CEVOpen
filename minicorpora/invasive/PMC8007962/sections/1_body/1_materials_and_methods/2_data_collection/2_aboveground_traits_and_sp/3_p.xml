<p>Leaf carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents were measured on three individuals per species per EcoUnit. Leaf C concentration is related to plant photosynthetic rates and to the amount of structural tissues, while leaf N content is correlated with the N available in the environment and indicates the nutritional quality of the plant (

Each pool was then ground individually, and around 1 mg of the ground material per sample was used to measure nutrient concentrations (% dry-leaf mass) and
