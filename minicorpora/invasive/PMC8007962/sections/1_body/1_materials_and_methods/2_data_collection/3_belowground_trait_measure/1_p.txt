0: To sample community root traits, two soil cores (10 cm deep,  5 cm) were taken in each half of the EcoUnits (taken at around 35 cm from the edge of the mesocosm), pooled, and sieved (2 mm mesh size).
1: From this homogenized, sieved soil, 45 g were used for nutrient and microbial analyses (see Abiotic and Biotic Soil Properties); and the remaining soil was washed over a 63-m sieve under tap water to collect the roots.
2: Afterward, we discarded the dead roots (i.e., roots without flexibility, hollow, or black) and sorted the rest of them into coarse roots ( > 2mm) and fine roots (< 2 mm).
3: The biomass of the different types of roots was measured.
4: Community fine-root trait measurements were performed on a sub-sample of about one eighth [on average 0.42  0.12 g of fresh mass (mean  sd)] representative of the pool of fine roots collected.
