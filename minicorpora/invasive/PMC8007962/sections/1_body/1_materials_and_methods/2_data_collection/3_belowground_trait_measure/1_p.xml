<p>To sample community root traits, two soil cores (10 cm deep, Ø 5 cm) were taken in each half of the EcoUnits (taken at around 35 cm from the edge of the mesocosm), pooled, and sieved (2 mm mesh size). From this homogenized, sieved soil, 45 g were used for nutrient and microbial analyses (see “Abiotic and Biotic Soil Properties”); and the remaining soil was washed over a 63-μm sieve under tap water to collect the roots. Afterward, we discarded the dead roots (i.e., roots without flexibility, hollow, or black) and sorted the rest of them into coarse roots (Ø &gt; 2mm) and fine roots (Ø &lt; 2 mm). The biomass of the different types of roots was measured. Community fine-root trait measurements were performed on a sub-sample of about one eighth [on average 0.42 ± 0.12 g of fresh mass (mean ± sd)] representative of the pool of fine roots collected.</p>
