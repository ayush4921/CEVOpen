<p>The total root length of the individual that was used for further analyses, was calculated as the ratio of the total fresh mass of fine roots multiplied by the root length of the sub-sample and divided by the fresh mass of the sub-sample of fine roots. The shoot:root ratio of two individuals per species per EcoUnit was calculated using the sum of dried aboveground biomass (including leaf mass used for leaf traits measurements) divided by the sum of the dried biomass of all its respective root samples.</p>
