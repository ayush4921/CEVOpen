0: Plant above- and belowground traits related to plant development, resource-use strategy, and reproduction ability were measured after 103 days of the experiment.
1: Prior to trait measurements, total cover as well as the species-specific plant cover were estimated using a modified decimal scale from  Londo (1976).
2: To do so and to avoid sampling bias, two persons estimated visually and independently the cover of each community and agreed on a cover category.
3: The same procedure was applied for the cover of each species in each mesocosm.
4: Trees re-sproutings were included in the total cover estimation.
5: Thirteen cover categories were defined:<1%; 13%; 35%; 515%; 1525%; 2535%; 3545%; 4555%; 5565%; 6575%; 7585%; 8595%; and >95%.
6: The median values of these classes (0.5, 2, 4, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 98%) were used for further analyses.
