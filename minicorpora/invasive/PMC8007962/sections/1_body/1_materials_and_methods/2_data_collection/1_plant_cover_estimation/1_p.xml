<p>Plant above- and belowground traits related to plant development, resource-use strategy, and reproduction ability were measured after 103 days of the experiment. Prior to trait measurements, total cover as well as the species-specific plant cover were estimated using a modified decimal scale from 
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Londo (1976)</xref>. To do so and to avoid sampling bias, two persons estimated visually and independently the cover of each community and agreed on a cover category. The same procedure was applied for the cover of each species in each mesocosm. Trees re-sproutings were included in the total cover estimation. Thirteen cover categories were defined: &lt;1%; 1–3%; 3–5%; 5–15%; 15–25%; 25–35%; 35–45%; 45–55%; 55–65%; 65–75%; 75–85%; 85–95%; and &gt;95%. The median values of these classes (0.5, 2, 4, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 98%) were used for further analyses.
