<p>At the end of the experiment, we verified that earthworms successfully established and were active in our EcoUnits. Across the replicates of the earthworm treatment, we counted on average 35 ± 2.61 casts per m
 <sup>2</sup> (mean ± sd) produced by the earthworms at the surface of the soil. We then assessed earthworm abundances by performing earthworm extraction in two opposite quarters of each EcoUnit, using the hot mustard method (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Eisenhauer et al., 2008</xref>). The mustard solution was prepared by diluting 100 g of mustard powder in 10 L of tap water. In each quarter of the EcoUnit, 5 l of the mustard solution was applied to a circle of 50 cm in diameter. Earthworms appearing at the soil surface were collected during 15 min. Then, the procedure was repeated by adding another 5 l of mustard solution, and earthworms were collected for another 15 min. Then, they were sorted, counted, and weighed according to ecological groups. We extracted almost half (∼42%) of the earthworms that were initially inoculated. Across the EcoUnits where earthworms were added, the density of earthworms extracted was around 18.3 ± 4.9 ind.m
 <sup>2</sup> (mean ± sd), and their total biomass was around 50.1 ± 9.9 g.m
 <sup>2</sup> (mean ± sd). However, the density of earthworms in the mesocosms is probably underestimated, as the mustard extraction method is not comprehensive and also less efficient for endogeic species (

 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Gutiérrez-López et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, extracted earthworms mainly belonged to the anecic species 
 <italic>L. terrestris</italic> (17.8 ± 4.8 ind.m
 <sup>2</sup>; 50 ± 9.7 g.m
 <sup>2</sup>), while few were from the endogeic species 
 <italic>A. rosea</italic> (0.4 ± 1.0 ind.m
 <sup>2</sup>; 0.1 ± 0.3 g.m
 <sup>2</sup>). These results thus indicate the successful establishment of the earthworm treatment, but does not allow any conclusions about the percentage of surviving earthworms. No earthworms were found in the control treatment.
