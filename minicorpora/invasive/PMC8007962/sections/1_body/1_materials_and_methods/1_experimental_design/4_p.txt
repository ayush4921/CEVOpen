0: The herbaceous plant community was planted approximately 1 month after the last tree replacement to avoid disturbance due to the replacement of dead trees.
1: The seedlings constituting the herbaceous community were planted according to two random patterns of the plant community mixture.
2: In both patterns, the plant community consisted of 50% grasses and 50% herbs, with herbs and grasses planted in an alternate order ( Supplementary Material 1).
3: These patterns were set to introduce heterogeneity in the location of the different plant species of the plant understory community.
4: Species within functional groups were randomly distributed to functional group locations in each pattern, keeping the number of individuals per species and EcoUnit constant (36 individuals per species, thus 144 individuals per community in one EcoUnit).
5: The plant seedlings were pre-grown in a greenhouse for about 1628 days at 21C at day and 15C at night, and were transplanted at 10 cm distances into each EcoUnit forming the experimental plant communities.
6: The average height ( sd) of transplanted seedlings depended on the plant growth forms.
7: Overall seedlings of herb species such as  S. laeve that form a basal rosette (1.6  0.6 cm) were smaller than that of grass species such as  B. ciliatus that grow up erected/upright (15.5  3.3 cm).
8: Achillea millefolium (8.2  3.5 cm) and  C. canadensis (12.4  3.7 cm) had intermediate height.
9: Dead seedlings were replaced during the first 3 weeks, and weeds originating from the seed bank were removed regularly.
10: None of the experimental treatments influenced the survival of the planted individuals ( Supplementary Material 2).
