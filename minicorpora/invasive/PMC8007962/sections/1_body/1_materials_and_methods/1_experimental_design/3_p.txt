0: The aboveground community consisted of four Canadian native plant species (grasses and herbs) and two native tree species.
1: The seeds of grasses [ Calamagrostis canadensis (Michx.)
2: and  Bromus ciliatus (L.)] were purchased from Prairie Moon Nursery (MN, United States) and the herbs [ Symphyotrichum laeve (L.) and  A. millefolium (L.)] from the nursery Wild About Flowers (AB, Canada).
3: While native populations of  A. millefolium occur in North America, exotic populations originating from Europe have also established, leading to a possible hybridization and thus difficulty to distinguish them morphologically ( Mulligan and Bassett, 1959;  Warwick and Black, 1982).
4: Therefore, the reader should note that we cannot be sure to have sown native seeds of  A. millefolium in the present study.
5: The tree species  Populus balsamifera (L.) and  Populus tremuloides (Michx.)
6: came from the tree nursery Pflanzenhandel Winkler Gbr (Germany).
7: After careful washing of the roots with tap water to avoid the introduction of soil fauna into the EcoUnits, two individuals of each of the two tree species were planted diagonally at a distance of around 85 cm in each of the EcoUnits, adding up to four tree individuals in each EcoUnit, with one tree individual in the center of each quarter.
8: Dead trees were replaced during the first 5 weeks and were harvested after 16 weeks of the experiment.
9: Although the presence of trees was important to simulate the conditions in the target forest, tree responses to earthworms were not investigated in the present study, whereas we used the dry weight of the tree biomass produced per EcoUnit (dried at 60C for 72 h, and including the biomass of trees re-sproutings) as a covariate in our models to explain plant trait- and community responses.
10: The tree performance assessments had a different focus than the study of herbaceous plant traits ( Thakur et al., 2020).
