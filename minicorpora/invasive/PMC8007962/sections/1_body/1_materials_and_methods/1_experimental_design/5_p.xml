<p>The earthworm treatment was applied 16 days after planting the trees. Earthworms were added to half of the EcoUnits (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6 without earthworms and 
 <italic>n</italic> = 6 with earthworms) and corresponded to a mixture of two ecological groups of earthworms to simulate the earthworm community and functional composition of northern North American ecosystems (
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">Straube et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Eisenhauer et al., 2011</xref>). To the six EcoUnits with earthworm presence, we added earthworm species from the Lumbricidae family, invasive in North America with a density of around 43 ind.m
 <sup>–2</sup>: 50 individuals of 
 <italic>Lumbricus terrestris</italic> (L.) (anecic; total average fresh weight ± sd: 167.31 ± 0.92 g) and 15 individuals of 
 <italic>Aporrectodea rosea</italic> (Savigny) (endogeic; 4.02 ± 0.10 g) were introduced. Earthworms were purchased from commercial suppliers (TZ – Terraristik Zentrum, Germany) or collected in a garden in the vicinity of Leipzig (Germany) and kept in the fridge (12°C) until use. To control for the potential effect of soil in earthworm guts (including nutrients and microorganisms), 4 g of soil previously used for earthworm storage was added to each EcoUnit of the control treatment without earthworms. During the experiment, we added litter on the top of the soil to provide food to earthworms and simulate natural conditions. Three times, 50 g of litter collected from 
 <italic>Populus nigra var. italica</italic> stands in the vicinity of Leipzig (Germany) were added to each EcoUnit. The litter material was cut into small pieces of about 2 cm in diameter and homogeneously distributed on the soil surface. The last litter addition (this time a total of 100 g per EcoUnit) was done 40 days before the end of the experiment and consisted of a mixture of 
 <sup>15</sup>N labeled and non-labeled poplar litter. The mixture contained 5% of labeled material (4.2 ± 3.8 atom% 
 <sup>15</sup>N) and was used to explore potential earthworm-induced changes in nutrient mineralization and uptake by plants based on 
 <sup>15</sup>N signatures in plant leaves.
