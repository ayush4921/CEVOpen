0: The bottom part of each EcoUnit (inner dimension (L  W  H): 1.24  1.24  0.8 m) was filled with 1.23 m 3 of sterilized topsoil (pH = 7.05; C:N = 9.30) provided by Bauzentrum Farys GmbH, Laucha.
1: Prior to filling the EcoUnits, the soil was sterilized by steam heating (120C for 1 h) and was then heavily watered to drain the nutrients resulting from the sterilization procedure.
2: Afterward, the soil was re-inoculated with a microbial wash of the soil from the earthworm-free area of the above-mentioned aspen forest in Kananaskis Valley (Alberta, Canada) to introduce soil microbial communities without any co-evolutionary history with European earthworms.
3: To do so, Canadian soil was collected in the field, shipped to Germany in a cooling box, sieved (4 mm mesh size), and homogenized.
4: We then mixed 380 g of this soil with 300 mL of tap water and homogenized and sieved (125 m mesh size) the solution.
5: The extracted solution was re-diluted with 100 ml of tap water and then distributed homogeneously on the topsoil of each EcoUnit.
