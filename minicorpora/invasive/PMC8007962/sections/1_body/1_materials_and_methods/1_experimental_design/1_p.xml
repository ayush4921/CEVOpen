<p>We investigated how exotic earthworms affect plant functional traits in an indoor mesocosm experiment. We simulated the conditions of a well-studied Canadian aspen forest that is known to experience earthworm invasion and subsequent shifts in plant communities (

For each of the EcoUnits, the air temperature was on average 18.5 ± 2.3°C at day (± sd) and 15.7 ± 1.7°C at night (mean ± sd), in a 16 h day/8 h night cycle, with a light intensity of around 400 μmol m

The EcoUnits were irrigated using a sprinkler system delivering 1 L of tap water in ∼1 min, every 6 h. The amount of tap water used was adjusted regularly and simultaneously for each EcoUnit and ranged between 0.5 L to 1 L in order to keep the volumetric soil water content lower than 40%.
