0: At the end of the experiment, we verified that earthworms successfully established and were active in our EcoUnits.
1: Across the replicates of the earthworm treatment, we counted on average 35  2.61 casts per m 2 (mean  sd) produced by the earthworms at the surface of the soil.
2: We then assessed earthworm abundances by performing earthworm extraction in two opposite quarters of each EcoUnit, using the hot mustard method ( Eisenhauer et al., 2008).
3: The mustard solution was prepared by diluting 100 g of mustard powder in 10 L of tap water.
4: In each quarter of the EcoUnit, 5 l of the mustard solution was applied to a circle of 50 cm in diameter.
5: Earthworms appearing at the soil surface were collected during 15 min.
6: Then, the procedure was repeated by adding another 5 l of mustard solution, and earthworms were collected for another 15 min.
7: Then, they were sorted, counted, and weighed according to ecological groups.
8: We extracted almost half (42%) of the earthworms that were initially inoculated.
9: Across the EcoUnits where earthworms were added, the density of earthworms extracted was around 18.3  4.9 ind.m 2 (mean  sd), and their total biomass was around 50.1  9.9 g.m 2 (mean  sd).
10: However, the density of earthworms in the mesocosms is probably underestimated, as the mustard extraction method is not comprehensive and also less efficient for endogeic species ( Chan and Munro, 2001;  Lawrence and Bowers, 2002;  Gutierrez-Lopez et al., 2016).
11: Indeed, extracted earthworms mainly belonged to the anecic species  L. terrestris (17.8  4.8 ind.m 2; 50  9.7 g.m 2), while few were from the endogeic species  A. rosea (0.4  1.0 ind.m 2; 0.1  0.3 g.m 2).
12: These results thus indicate the successful establishment of the earthworm treatment, but does not allow any conclusions about the percentage of surviving earthworms.
13: No earthworms were found in the control treatment.
