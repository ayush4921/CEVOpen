0: The earthworm treatment was applied 16 days after planting the trees.
1: Earthworms were added to half of the EcoUnits ( n = 6 without earthworms and  n = 6 with earthworms) and corresponded to a mixture of two ecological groups of earthworms to simulate the earthworm community and functional composition of northern North American ecosystems ( Straube et al., 2009;  Eisenhauer et al., 2011).
2: To the six EcoUnits with earthworm presence, we added earthworm species from the Lumbricidae family, invasive in North America with a density of around 43 ind.m 2: 50 individuals of  Lumbricus terrestris (L.) (anecic; total average fresh weight  sd: 167.31  0.92 g) and 15 individuals of  Aporrectodea rosea (Savigny) (endogeic; 4.02  0.10 g) were introduced.
3: Earthworms were purchased from commercial suppliers (TZ  Terraristik Zentrum, Germany) or collected in a garden in the vicinity of Leipzig (Germany) and kept in the fridge (12C) until use.
4: To control for the potential effect of soil in earthworm guts (including nutrients and microorganisms), 4 g of soil previously used for earthworm storage was added to each EcoUnit of the control treatment without earthworms.
5: During the experiment, we added litter on the top of the soil to provide food to earthworms and simulate natural conditions.
6: Three times, 50 g of litter collected from  Populus nigra var.
7: italica stands in the vicinity of Leipzig (Germany) were added to each EcoUnit.
8: The litter material was cut into small pieces of about 2 cm in diameter and homogeneously distributed on the soil surface.
9: The last litter addition (this time a total of 100 g per EcoUnit) was done 40 days before the end of the experiment and consisted of a mixture of  15N labeled and non-labeled poplar litter.
10: The mixture contained 5% of labeled material (4.2  3.8 atom%  15N) and was used to explore potential earthworm-induced changes in nutrient mineralization and uptake by plants based on  15N signatures in plant leaves.
