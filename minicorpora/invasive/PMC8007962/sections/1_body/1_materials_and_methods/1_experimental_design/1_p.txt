0: We investigated how exotic earthworms affect plant functional traits in an indoor mesocosm experiment.
1: We simulated the conditions of a well-studied Canadian aspen forest that is known to experience earthworm invasion and subsequent shifts in plant communities ( Eisenhauer et al., 2007,  2009d;  Straube et al., 2009).
2: The experiment was conducted at the iDiv Ecotron of the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig in Germany ( Eisenhauer and Turke, 2018).
3: We used twelve EcoUnits (i.e., experimental units) set up in an air temperature-controlled environment.
4: For each of the EcoUnits, the air temperature was on average 18.5  2.3C at day ( sd) and 15.7  1.7C at night (mean  sd), in a 16 h day/8 h night cycle, with a light intensity of around 400 mol m 2 s 1 of photosynthetic photon flux density at the soil surface.
5: The soil temperature was on average 17.1  1C.
6: The EcoUnits were irrigated using a sprinkler system delivering 1 L of tap water in 1 min, every 6 h. The amount of tap water used was adjusted regularly and simultaneously for each EcoUnit and ranged between 0.5 L to 1 L in order to keep the volumetric soil water content lower than 40%.
