0: The effects of earthworms on soil abiotic properties (i.e., carbon and nitrogen content, C:N ratio, and water content) and soil microbial activity (i.e., basal respiration, microbial biomass, microbial specific respiratory quotient) were analyzed using the independent samples  t-test in case of homoscedasticity or Welch t-statistic in case of heteroscedasticity from the package stats ( R Core Team, 2020).
1: The effects of earthworms on fatty acid composition of the soil microbial community were analyzed in a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) from the package stats ( R Core Team, 2020).
2: All figures were made with the package ggplot2 ( Wickham, 2016).
