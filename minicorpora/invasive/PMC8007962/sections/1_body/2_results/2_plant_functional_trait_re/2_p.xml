<p>Earthworm effects on plant height depended on the species identity as shown by the significant interaction between plant species identity and earthworm treatment (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.04, 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Plant height was also negatively affected by tree biomass, especially for the species 
 <italic>S. laeve</italic> and 
 <italic>C. canadensis</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS4">Supplementary Material 4</xref>). Overall, the height of 
 <italic>B. ciliatus</italic> (mean ± sd: 40.78 ± 17.58 cm) and 
 <italic>C. canadensis</italic> (mean ± sd: 39.92 ± 20.53 cm) were more than twice higher than the one of 
 <italic>A. millefolium</italic> (mean ± sd: 17.64 ± 6.95 cm) and 
 <italic>S. laeve</italic> (mean ± sd: 5.97 ± 3.93 cm). 
 <italic>Bromus ciliatus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. canadensis</italic> showed different heights in the control treatment, but this difference disappeared in the presence of earthworms (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS5">Supplementary Material 5</xref>), where we observed on average an increase in 
 <italic>C. canadensis</italic>’ height of around 7 cm and a decrease in 
 <italic>B. ciliatus</italic>’ height of around 5 cm.
