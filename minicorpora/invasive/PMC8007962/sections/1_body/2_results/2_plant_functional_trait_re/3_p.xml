<p>Leaf trait values (i.e., specific leaf area and leaf dry matter content) depended also on the interaction between species identity and the presence of earthworms, although this interaction was only marginally significant for leaf dry matter content (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.04 and 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.10, respectively; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Although the two grass species showed similar SLA and LDMC in the control treatment, they differed in the presence of earthworms (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS5">Supplementary Material 5</xref>): 
 <italic>B. ciliatus</italic> showed a higher specific leaf area (+ 13.3%) and a lower leaf dry matter content (−8.8%) in the presence of earthworms than in the control treatment, while these traits responded contrarily in 
 <italic>C. canadensis</italic> (−10.2% and +2.1%, respectively). The two herbs species 
 <italic>S. laeve</italic> and 
 <italic>A. millefolium</italic> differed in their specific leaf area and leaf dry matter content, independent of the earthworm treatment.
