<p>The total root length differed between species (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>) with 
 <italic>S. laeve</italic> showing on average the lowest and 
 <italic>C. canadensis</italic> the highest. Although we found little evidence of earthworm effects on the root traits, the total root length was affected by the interaction between earthworm and species identity (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.01, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). The total length of the root produced by 
 <italic>C. canadensis</italic> was significantly lower in the presence of earthworms than in their absence (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS4">Supplementary Material 4</xref>). Furthermore, without earthworms, the total length of the roots produced by 
 <italic>C. canadensis</italic> was significantly higher than the one from 
 <italic>A. millefolium</italic> and 
 <italic>B. ciliatus</italic>, while the species 
 <italic>S. laeve</italic> showed a total length lower than the three other species. However, the difference between the grass species was weakest in the presence of earthworms (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS5">Supplementary Material 5</xref>): the root length of 
 <italic>C. canadensis</italic> decreased (âˆ’44.3%) until reaching a similar root length to the one of 
 <italic>B. ciliatus</italic> and 
 <italic>A. millefolium</italic>.
