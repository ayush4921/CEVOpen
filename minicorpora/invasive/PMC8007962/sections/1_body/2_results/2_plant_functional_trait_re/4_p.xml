<p>Leaf carbon and nitrogen content and the leaf C:N ratio did not change in response to the earthworm treatments and the interaction between species identity and earthworm treatments, but varied across species (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). The lowest carbon and nitrogen content were measured in 
 <italic>A. millefolium</italic> and 
 <italic>B. ciliatus</italic>, respectively. 
 <italic>Bromus ciliatus</italic> showed the highest C:N ratio, while 
 <italic>S. laeve</italic> had the lowest. Tree biomass tended to increase leaf nitrogen content (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.06), but tended to decrease the C:N ratio (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.08), while it did not affect the carbon content (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.69, Table 1). However, the δ
 <sup>15</sup>N signature in plants depended on the interaction between earthworm presence and species identity (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.014, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Overall, we observed a decrease of the δ
 <sup>15</sup>N signature in plant tissues when earthworms were present (−9.6%, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.04, Table 1). However, this effect was mainly observed for the species 
 <italic>A. millefolium</italic> (−21.5%, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001,
