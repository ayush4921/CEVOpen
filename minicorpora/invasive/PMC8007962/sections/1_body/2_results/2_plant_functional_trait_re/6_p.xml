<p>At the species level, root traits varied across species and changed with tree biomass. On average, the species 
 <italic>S. laeve</italic> showed a larger diameter and a higher root dry matter content than 
 <italic>A. millefolium</italic>, 
 <italic>B. ciliatus</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. canadensis</italic>. The lowest values of these three traits were measured on the species 
 <italic>C. canadensis</italic>, as well as 
 <italic>A. millefolium</italic> regarding the dry matter content. 
 <italic>Achillea millefolium</italic>, 
 <italic>B. ciliatus</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. canadensis</italic> showed similar root tissue density, but this trait was higher in 
 <italic>S. laeve</italic>, although it did not significantly differ from the one of 
 <italic>B. ciliatus</italic>. 
 <italic>Calamagrostis canadensis</italic> showed the highest values of specific root length, while the lowest were measured on 
 <italic>S. laeve</italic>. 
 <italic>Achillea millefolium</italic> and 
 <italic>B. ciliatus</italic> showed similar intermediate values of specific root length. Higher tree biomass also decreased the root tissue density (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.008) at the species level except for the species 
 <italic>B. ciliatus</italic>, and overall the root dry matter content (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.03) of the different species (
