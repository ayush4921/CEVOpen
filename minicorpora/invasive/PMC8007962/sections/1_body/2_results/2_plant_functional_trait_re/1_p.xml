<p>Among the aboveground traits studied, all of them depended on species identity and were negligibly affected by the tree biomass (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS3">Supplementary Material 3</xref>). Four out of the 15 above- and belowground traits measured were significantly affected by earthworm presence. Although earthworm presence did not affect the shoot:root ratio (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), nor the proportion of flowering individuals and number of ramets (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) and the nutrient content of the plants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), it induced changes in the plant height, leaf (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) and roots traits (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>).
