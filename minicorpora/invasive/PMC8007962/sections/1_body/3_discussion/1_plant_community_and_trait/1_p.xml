<p>Although earthworms did not induce significant changes in plant cover and biomass, both at the community- and species-level (hypothesis i), they influenced some of the assessed plant functional traits. More specifically, four out of the fifteen above- and belowground traits were significantly affected by the interaction between earthworm presence and plant species identity. These plant species- and trait-specific responses to earthworm presence are subtle but may alter competitive interactions between plant species and should thus be further explored as potential mechanism underlying widely observed plant community changes in response to earthworm invasion (e.g.,
