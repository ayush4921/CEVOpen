<p>With four of the studied traits that responded significantly to earthworms presence, our study partly confirmed our hypothesis that earthworms affect the traits related to plant resource uptake and development (hypothesis ii). Aboveground traits, such as the vegetative height, specific leaf area, and leaf dry matter content responded to earthworm presence, although the responses were plant species-specific (hypothesis iii). This study thus confirms results from previous studies that earthworms can impact plant height (

However, we did not observe any significant effect of earthworm presence on the reproductive plant traits (i.e., the proportion of flowering individuals and number of ramets). Diverse results were observed in previous studies. For example, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Dávalos et al. (2013)</xref> also showed that the probability of flowering was not affected by exotic earthworms, while the number of culms produced by sedges decreased. By contrast, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Blume-Werry et al. (2020)</xref> showed positive and neutral effects of exotic earthworm presence on the production of floral shoots by native plants, while 
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">Zaller and Arnone (1999)</xref> measured a higher number of ramets produced by native plant species close to native earthworm casts. Similar to plant biomass responses, earthworm effects on reproductive plant traits may vary with the abiotic and biotic context though. For instance, 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Eisenhauer and Scheu (2008)</xref> observed neutral effects of native earthworms on the number of legume flower heads in the absence of grasses, while earthworms reduced their number in the presence of grasses by fostering the competitive strength of grasses against legumes. Other biotic factors such as the composition and diversity of the earthworm community (e.g., 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Hale, 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Craven et al., 2017</xref>) could also have differently affected the trait responses of the plant species studied.
