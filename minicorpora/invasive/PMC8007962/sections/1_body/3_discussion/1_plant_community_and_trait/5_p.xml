<p>Other root traits could also be investigated in further studies. Mycorrhizal associations deserve some attention, as they play a key role in plant development and nutrient acquisition and were shown to be significantly affected by invasive earthworms (

 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Paudel et al., 2016</xref>). The abilities of plants to spread their root system laterally or their rooting depth may also have some importance in the belowground plant response to earthworm presence (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Eisenhauer et al., 2012b</xref>). Species with a higher density of roots in the upper soil layer or a strong lateral spread of their roots might take advantage of being closer to earthworm casts and middens at the soil surface that are known to affect plant growth. For example, studies showed that the proximity of the plant to native earthworm casts enhanced plant growth and ramet production (
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">Zaller and Arnone, 1999</xref>), which could be explained by the presence of hormone-like molecules regulating plant growth in earthworm casts (
