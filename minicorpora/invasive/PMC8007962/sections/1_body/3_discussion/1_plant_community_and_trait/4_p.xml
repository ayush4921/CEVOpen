<p>In the present study, earthworms did not enhance the N content of the plant species, which is in line with some previous studies with native earthworms (
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">Wurst et al., 2005</xref>) and a meta-analysis (
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">van Groenigen et al., 2014</xref>), but is in contrast to some others showing that earthworms increase nitrogen concentrations in grass shoots (
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">Wurst et al., 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Eisenhauer and Scheu, 2008</xref>). An increase in leaf tissue nitrogen concentrations could also have been expected, as earthworm activity (e.g., enhanced nitrogen mineralization) and also dead/decomposing earthworms would increase plant-available nitrogen (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Barois et al., 1999</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Kos et al., 2017</xref>). The lack of change in leaf nutrient content may be linked to the few changes in root traits between earthworm treatments, as roots have an important role in nutrient uptake and transfer to aboveground organs (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Oaks and Hirel, 1985</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Eissenstat, 1992</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Bloom et al., 2003</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Brown et al., 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Peel, 2013</xref>). Surprisingly, although earthworms are known to decrease the spatial homogeneity of soil resource distribution (
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">Shuster et al., 2001</xref>), we did not observe a strong modification of the plant belowground traits at the species and community level, which differed from what was shown in previous studies. 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Blume-Werry et al. (2020)</xref> showed that fine root growth of the plant community was higher in the presence of exotic earthworms in meadows after 55 days and after 103 days of experiment independent of the vegetation type (meadows vs. heath, with plant communities mainly composed of forbs or shrubs, respectively, and grasses) than in the absence of earthworms. 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Cameron et al. (2014)</xref> showed that the proportion of 
 <italic>A. millefolium</italic> roots present in exotic earthworms burrows was important during the first month of growth, but root growth in soil cracks became similarly important after 2 and 3 months. These authors also observed an opposite pattern for the root distribution of 
 <italic>Campanula rotundifolia</italic>: although its root occurrence was similar in cracks and burrows after 1 month of experiment, it decreased in exotic earthworm burrows after 2 and 3 months (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Cameron et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, the minor responses of root traits to earthworms observed in the present study could be explained by potential transient effects, which may also be plant species-specific due to differences in the growth rate and growth strategy. Thus, root trait changes induced by earthworms could have taken place at earlier stages of plant growth, with a difference between treatments being less pronounced after 3 months of experiment. Future studies may thus explore potential temporal dynamics of earthworm effects on plant traits. Another explanation for minor root trait responses could be that soil nutrients (e.g., nitrogen) were not limiting enough to induce different responses of the root traits between the two treatments. Thus, plants which could preferentially forage in the burrows of earthworms would not take any advantage of doing this against plants that would not express this behavior, and thus that earthworm effects on root foraging in burrows would be more visible under limiting soil nutrient levels (
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">van Groenigen et al., 2014</xref>). This could also explain why we did not observe any significant changes in the nutrient content and microbial community properties in the upper soil layer in response to earthworms, which is in contrast to previous meta-analyses (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Ferlian et al., 2018</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Invasive earthworms were shown to have opposing effects on organic and mineral soil layers for carbon and nitrogen concentrations (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Ferlian et al., 2020</xref>), and their effects on soil microorganisms were neutral when the different soil layers were pooled (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Ferlian et al., 2018</xref>). Although we cannot exclude that the duration of the experiment may have been too short to observe the effect of earthworms in the large volume of soil (âˆ¼1 m
 <sup>3</sup>), the analysis of soil properties across all soil layers could also have masked the effect of earthworms on the nutrient content and microbial community properties.
