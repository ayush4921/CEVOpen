<p>Several studies have shown that exotic and native earthworms stimulate the productivity of different plant species and communities; but also neutral effects were observed (

Mechanisms/pathways involving plant functional traits behind these inconsistent results are not well known, but a meta-analysis showed that native earthworm effects become weak to non-significant the more fertile the soil is and with a high proportion of sand in the soil (
