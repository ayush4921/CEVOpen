<p>In contrast to 
 <italic>A. millefolium</italic>, the development of 
 <italic>S. laeve</italic> was correlated to its root traits. This species overall invested more of its resources into the production of belowground costly tissue, such as roots with large root diameter and high dry matter content, than in its aboveground development. This response was found to be most accentuated in the presence of earthworms as indicated by the positive correlation between the δ
 <sup>15</sup>N signature with the root diameter of 
 <italic>S. laeve</italic> in the presence of earthworms, as well as by the negative correlation of the δ
 <sup>15</sup>N signature with its ramet production, and the non-significant although marginally positive correlation with its height (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS6">Supplementary Material 6</xref>). Furthermore, the negative correlation between δ
 <sup>15</sup>N signature in 
 <italic>S. laeve</italic> in the presence of earthworms and its specific root length also suggests that this species could preferentially forage in the nutrient-rich burrows or casts of earthworms. However, the consequences of this strategy in response to earthworms remain to be investigated in long-term studies and under natural field conditions.
