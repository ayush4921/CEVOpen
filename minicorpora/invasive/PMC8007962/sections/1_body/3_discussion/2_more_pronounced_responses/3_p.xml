<p>In contrast to 
 <italic>C. canadensis</italic>, 
 <italic>B. ciliatus</italic> showed a higher specific leaf area and a lower leaf dry matter content in the presence of earthworms, while its height, ramet, and flower production, and root traits were unaffected by earthworms. This species probably directed its resources toward the production of a more costly and dense root system (i.e., with a higher root diameter, dry matter content, and tissue density) instead of favoring its aboveground growth or investing into reproduction. This shift of resource allocation to the root system was emphasized in presence of earthworms where plant height and shoot:root ratio were significantly correlated with root dry matter content and root tissue density (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS6">Supplementary Material 6</xref>). Furthermore, we did not observe any significant correlation between the Î´
 <sup>15</sup>N signature of 
 <italic>B. ciliatus</italic> and its height or its shoot:root ratio nor any other traits in the presence of earthworms (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS6">Supplementary Material 6</xref>). To sum up, our results indicate that 
 <italic>B. ciliatus</italic> did not preferentially forage in earthworm burrows or casts, and that its development and thus changes of leaf traits were rather independent of nutrients coming from the litter decomposed by earthworms or their casts. This result is in line with the observation made by 
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">Zaller and Arnone (1999)</xref>, who did not observe any significant relationship between native earthworm activity (i.e., surface cast production) and the growth (i.e., production of ramets) of the native congeneric species 
 <italic>B. erectus</italic>. Thus, grasses were shown to respond differently to the presence of earthworms, even if both showed stronger responses than herbs in the present study.
