<p>Indeed, among the measured traits, only the δ
 <sup>15</sup>N signature in 
 <italic>A. millefolium</italic> was significantly affected by earthworm presence. However, the two herbs species studied showed opposite responses to earthworm presence. While we observed a strong decrease of the δ
 <sup>15</sup>N signature in leaves of 
 <italic>A. millefolium</italic> when earthworms were present, this value was not correlated to any of the other traits studied (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS6">Supplementary Material 6</xref>). As 
 <italic>A. millefolium</italic> has been reported to preferentially forage in exotic earthworms burrows (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Cameron et al., 2014</xref>), we would have expected to observe an effect of earthworms on various root traits as well as significant correlations between these root traits (i.e., SRL) and the δ
 <sup>15</sup>N signature in leaves when earthworms were present. Our results were thus unexpected and could potentially be related to the fact that exotic earthworms can also increase the leaching of soil nutrients through their burrows that function as preferential flow pathways of soil surface water (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Ferlian et al., 2020</xref>). This phenomenon is particularly pronounced for the vertical burrows of anecic earthworms like 
 <italic>L. terrestris</italic> that dominated the earthworm community in the present study.
