<p>Interestingly, however, the two grass species studied showed opposite responses to earthworms. Earthworms induced an increase of 
 <italic>C. canadensis</italic> height and leaf dry matter content, while it decreased its specific leaf area and total root length. A possible explanation for this result is a change in 
 <italic>C. canadensis</italic>â€™ growth strategy due to the potential changes in the spatial distribution of soil nutrients resulting from earthworm activity. More precisely, 
 <italic>C. canadensis</italic> could have shifted its biomass allocation from root production toward apical growth and more structural/less flimsy tissues, rather than into the lateral spread (i.e., ramet production) or reproduction (i.e., flower production) that did not change with earthworm presence. However, although this species showed a high leaf 
 <sup>15</sup>N signature that was not affected by earthworm presence, its leaf 
 <sup>15</sup>N signature was slightly positively correlated to the height in earthworm presence only (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS6">Supplementary Material 6</xref>), which suggests that 
 <italic>C. canadensis</italic> could take advantage of the nutrients coming from the litter decomposed by earthworms or found in their casts. This result is also corroborated by the leaf 
 <sup>15</sup>N signature of this species, which was negatively correlated to its specific root length. The increase of the leaf 
 <sup>15</sup>N signature when the cost of constructing roots decreased and root systems were less developed (i.e., low SRL) suggests that 
 <italic>C. canadensis</italic> could preferentially forage in the nutrient-rich burrows or casts of earthworms. Notably, although we did not observe any significant earthworm effects on soil N content at the end of the study, this gross measurement would not be able to reflect the concentrations of plant-available ammonium and nitrate as well as potential temporal or spatial differences in nutrient availability in response to earthworm activity.
