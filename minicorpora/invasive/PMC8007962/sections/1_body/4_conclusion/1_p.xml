<p>Our study provides novel insights into the trait responses of different plant species under earthworm invasion and indicates that these changes of plant strategies are not necessarily mediated by the effects of earthworms on gross soil abiotic properties and on the soil microbial activity or community structure. These results advance our understanding of the mechanisms behind plant community changes in response to earthworm invasion. Plant responses to earthworms were species-specific, and the development strategies of grass species were observed to be more likely affected by earthworm presence than that of herbs. However, even if the grass species responded faster to earthworm presence, herb responses to invasive earthworms may only be pronounced with time, calling for long-term studies. Indeed, the slow development due to the high costs of tissue production in slower-growing species may have masked potential beneficial effects of earthworms on their development in our experiment, which may have been too short to reflect potential beneficial effects.</p>
