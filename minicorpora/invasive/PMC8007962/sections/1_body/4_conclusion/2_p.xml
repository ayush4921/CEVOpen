<p>Nevertheless, our results suggest that by modifying some plant strategies, earthworms could potentially change the outcome of interspecific competition between plants in the longer term and may lead to a shift in plant species and functional group dominance in the plant community, as commonly observed in field studies on plant community responses to earthworm invasion (e.g., 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Craven et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, the strong adaptability and trait responses of the grass species to earthworm presence could explain why grasses commonly benefit in the early stages of earthworm invasion and the associated plant community changes (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Craven et al., 2017</xref>). However, the potential long-term effects of earthworms on plant traits and strategies remain to be investigated, as we showed that earthworms may also have beneficial effects on the resource uptake strategies of some herb species. Furthermore, the observed opposite patterns of response within each of the two plant functional groups in the presence of earthworms, suggest that the use of plant functional groups to characterize the consequences and mechanisms of earthworm invasion for plant community composition may mask some important differences and that approaches at the species level should be preferred in future long-term studies. Although with four plant species, we were unable to rigorously test this concept in the present work, the plant economics spectrum (
