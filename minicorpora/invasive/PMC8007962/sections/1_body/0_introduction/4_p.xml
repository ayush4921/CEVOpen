<p>Indeed, some plant species, such as the native species 
 <italic>Achillea millefolium</italic>, were shown to place their roots inside the burrows of exotic earthworms (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Cameron et al., 2014</xref>). As a consequence, exotic earthworms may specifically foster plant species with the highest ability to take up resources in their burrows and that have the highest plasticity in their functional traits. Such plant species are likely to be located toward the ‘fast end’ of the whole-plant economic spectrum (
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">Reich, 2014</xref>). Fast-growing species are characterized by, e.g., a low leaf dry matter content, high specific leaf area and nitrogen content in leaves (

 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Donovan et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">Reich, 2014</xref>), as well as a high specific root length and percentage of fine roots (
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">Tjoelker et al., 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">Roumet et al., 2016</xref>), with these characteristics being linked to high nutrient uptake and assimilation abilities. Consequently, earthworm-induced habitat changes could favor species with high adaptation and resource competition abilities under high resource conditions, such as fast-growing species like nitrophilous graminoid species (
