<p>A large portion of previous research on the ecosystem consequences of earthworm invasion in northern North America has focused on plant community composition and diversity (

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Craven et al., 2017</xref>). The direct and indirect mechanisms behind observed plant community changes are manifold. Invasive earthworms influence seed bank composition, seed recruitment, and the development and survival of seedlings (

 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Cassin and Kotanen, 2016</xref>). The outcome of these earthworm–seed interactions may depend on the morphological and chemical traits of seeds (

 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Clause et al., 2011</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Moreover, invasive earthworms can further alter the plant functional traits of native plants. Exotic earthworms induce changes in the above- and belowground biomass (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Hale et al., 2008</xref>), stem height, number of leaves and culms (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Dávalos et al., 2013</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), nutrient concentrations of tissues (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Dobson et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">Richardson et al., 2018</xref>), as well as myccorhizae association (
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Paudel et al., 2016</xref>). However, plant responses depend on the identity of the plant species and their functional groups (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Kreuzer et al., 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Eisenhauer and Scheu, 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Coulis et al., 2014</xref>), and may further vary according to the species’ phenotypic plasticity. Currently, we lack information about potential changes of a set of plant functional traits to better understand plant responses to exotic earthworm presence, and consequently the mechanisms behind native plant community changes.
