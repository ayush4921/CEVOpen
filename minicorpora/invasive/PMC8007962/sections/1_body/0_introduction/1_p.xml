<p>Biological invasions are one of the most important threats to native biodiversity (

 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Díaz et al., 2019</xref>). Among them, invasive ecosystem engineers, such as earthworms, can be particularly harmful (

 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Frelich et al., 2019</xref>). They affect soil properties (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Ferlian et al., 2020</xref>), native soil fauna (

 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Ferlian et al., 2018</xref>), and plant biodiversity (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Craven et al., 2017</xref>), with consequences for other trophic levels and ecosystem services (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Frelich et al., 2012</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). These effects are even stronger when recipient ecosystems lack functionally similar native soil fauna (
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">Wardle et al., 2011</xref>), such as the case for earthworms in many regions in northern North America. There, the native earthworm fauna is assumed to have disappeared during the last glaciation, prior to the recent introduction of exotic earthworm species ∼400 years ago (
