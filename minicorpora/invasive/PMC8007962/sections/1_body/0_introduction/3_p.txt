0: Earthworms are likely to alter soil nutrient availability and dynamics, such as changing the spatial distribution of nutrients from homogeneous to patchy ( Shuster et al., 2001) or the distribution between soil layers ( Ferlian et al., 2020).
1: Besides, invasive earthworms were shown to increase the drainage/leaching of soil nutrients in their burrows ( Larson et al., 2010;  Eisenhauer et al., 2012a).
2: Thus, we could expect that plant root traits respond to these earthworm-induced soil modifications, and that the changes in native plant community composition due to earthworm invasion are related to their selective effects on particular nutrient resource uptake strategies of plants ( Andriuzzi et al., 2016).
