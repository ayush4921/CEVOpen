0: Here, using a plant functional trait approach and plant species originating from the understory community of a North American boreal forest, we studied plant species responses to exotic earthworms to advance our understanding of the mechanisms behind native plant community changes due to earthworm invasion.
1: We hypothesize that (i) earthworms will increase plant community biomass and cover (mostly driven by a positive response of grasses) by increasing soil nutrient availability; (ii) earthworms will mainly affect the traits related to resource uptake (e.g., height, specific leaf area, and specific root length); and (iii) plant functional trait responses will vary according to plant species identity but will be more pronounced in grass species (i.e., fast-growing species) than in herb species.
