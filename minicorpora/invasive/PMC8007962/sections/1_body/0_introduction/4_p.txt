0: Indeed, some plant species, such as the native species  Achillea millefolium, were shown to place their roots inside the burrows of exotic earthworms ( Cameron et al., 2014).
1: As a consequence, exotic earthworms may specifically foster plant species with the highest ability to take up resources in their burrows and that have the highest plasticity in their functional traits.
2: Such plant species are likely to be located toward the fast end of the whole-plant economic spectrum ( Reich, 2014).
3: Fast-growing species are characterized by, e.g., a low leaf dry matter content, high specific leaf area and nitrogen content in leaves ( Craine, 2009;  Donovan et al., 2011;  Reich, 2014), as well as a high specific root length and percentage of fine roots ( Tjoelker et al., 2005;  Roumet et al., 2016), with these characteristics being linked to high nutrient uptake and assimilation abilities.
4: Consequently, earthworm-induced habitat changes could favor species with high adaptation and resource competition abilities under high resource conditions, such as fast-growing species like nitrophilous graminoid species ( Craven et al., 2017).
