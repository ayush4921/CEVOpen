0: A large portion of previous research on the ecosystem consequences of earthworm invasion in northern North America has focused on plant community composition and diversity ( Hale et al., 2006;  Nuzzo et al., 2009,  2015;  Hopfensperger et al., 2011;  Drouin et al., 2016;  Craven et al., 2017).
1: The direct and indirect mechanisms behind observed plant community changes are manifold.
2: Invasive earthworms influence seed bank composition, seed recruitment, and the development and survival of seedlings ( Hopfensperger et al., 2011;  Clause et al., 2015;  Dobson and Blossey, 2015;  Nuzzo et al., 2015;  Cassin and Kotanen, 2016).
3: The outcome of these earthwormseed interactions may depend on the morphological and chemical traits of seeds ( Eisenhauer et al., 2009c;  Clause et al., 2011,  2017).
4: Moreover, invasive earthworms can further alter the plant functional traits of native plants.
5: Exotic earthworms induce changes in the above- and belowground biomass ( Hale et al., 2008), stem height, number of leaves and culms ( Davalos et al., 2013,  2015), nutrient concentrations of tissues ( Dobson et al., 2017;  Richardson et al., 2018), as well as myccorhizae association ( Paudel et al., 2016).
6: However, plant responses depend on the identity of the plant species and their functional groups ( Kreuzer et al., 2004;  Eisenhauer and Scheu, 2008;  Coulis et al., 2014), and may further vary according to the species phenotypic plasticity.
7: Currently, we lack information about potential changes of a set of plant functional traits to better understand plant responses to exotic earthworm presence, and consequently the mechanisms behind native plant community changes.
