<p>Earthworms are likely to alter soil nutrient availability and dynamics, such as changing the spatial distribution of nutrients from homogeneous to patchy (
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">Shuster et al., 2001</xref>) or the distribution between soil layers (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Ferlian et al., 2020</xref>). Besides, invasive earthworms were shown to increase the drainage/leaching of soil nutrients in their burrows (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Larson et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Eisenhauer et al., 2012a</xref>). Thus, we could expect that plant root traits respond to these earthworm-induced soil modifications, and that the changes in native plant community composition due to earthworm invasion are related to their selective effects on particular nutrient resource uptake strategies of plants (
