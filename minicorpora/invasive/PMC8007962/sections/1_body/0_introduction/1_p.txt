0: Biological invasions are one of the most important threats to native biodiversity ( Davis, 2009;  Wardle et al., 2011;  Diaz et al., 2019).
1: Among them, invasive ecosystem engineers, such as earthworms, can be particularly harmful ( Bohlen et al., 2004;  Frelich et al., 2019).
2: They affect soil properties ( Ferlian et al., 2020), native soil fauna ( Eisenhauer, 2010;  Ferlian et al., 2018), and plant biodiversity ( Craven et al., 2017), with consequences for other trophic levels and ecosystem services ( Frelich et al., 2012,  2019).
3: These effects are even stronger when recipient ecosystems lack functionally similar native soil fauna ( Wardle et al., 2011), such as the case for earthworms in many regions in northern North America.
4: There, the native earthworm fauna is assumed to have disappeared during the last glaciation, prior to the recent introduction of exotic earthworm species 400 years ago ( Bohlen et al., 2004;  James and Hendrix, 2004;  Hendrix et al., 2008).
