 <caption> Effect of earthworm presence on reproductive traits: number of ramets (A) and proportion of flowering individuals (B). Estimated marginal means and confidence intervals are shown in black (after being back-transformed), while data points were included in the background in gray. The conditional R 2 or marginal R 2 in the case of the number of ramets as well as the p-values for each factor are based on linear mixed effect models. Number of observations per species and treatment: 6, except for the proportion of flowering individuals of B. ciliatus in the control treatment, where there are five observations. </caption>
