  <p>Effect of earthworm presence on reproductive traits: number of ramets 
   <bold>(A)</bold> and proportion of flowering individuals 
   <bold>(B)</bold>. Estimated marginal means and confidence intervals are shown in black (after being back-transformed), while data points were included in the background in gray. The conditional 
   <italic>R</italic>
   <sup>2</sup> or marginal 
   <italic>R</italic>
   <sup>2</sup> in the case of the number of ramets as well as the 
   <italic>p</italic>-values for each factor are based on linear mixed effect models. Number of observations per species and treatment: 6, except for the proportion of flowering individuals of 
   <italic>B. ciliatus</italic> in the control treatment, where there are five observations.
