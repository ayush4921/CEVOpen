 <caption> Effect of earthworm presence on leaf carbon (A) and nitrogen (B) content as well as their C/N ratio (C) and Î´ 15N signature (D). Estimated marginal means and confidence intervals are shown in black (after being back-transformed), while data points were included in the background in gray. The conditional R 2 as well as the p-values for each factor are based on linear mixed effect models. When the interaction between earthworm treatment and species identity were significant, post hoc test results are also presented: different letters show significant differences among species within each earthworm treatment. Number of observations per species and treatment: 18, except for S. leave in the control treatment, where there are 17 observations. </caption>
