 <caption> Effect of earthworm presence on root length (A), root diameter (B), root dry matter content (C), root tissue density (D), and specific root length (E). Estimated marginal means and confidence intervals are shown in black (after being back-transformed), while data points were included in the background in gray. The conditional R 2 as well as the p-values for each factor are based on linear mixed effect models. When the interaction between earthworm treatment and species identity were significant, post hoc test results are also presented: different letters show significant differences among species within each earthworm treatment. Number of observations per species and treatment: 12. </caption>
