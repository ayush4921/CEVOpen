 <caption> Effect of earthworm presence on plant height (A), shoot:root ratio (B), specific leaf area (C), and leaf dry matter content (D). Estimated marginal means and confidence intervals are shown in black (after being back-transformed), while data points were included in the background in gray. The conditional R 2 as well as the p-values for each factor are based on linear mixed effect models. When the interaction between earthworm treatment and species identity were significant, post hoc test results are also presented: different letters show significant differences among species within each earthworm treatment. Number of observations per species and treatment: 60 for height; 30 for SLA and LDMC, and 12 for the shoot:root ratio. </caption>
