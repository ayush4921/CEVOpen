  <p>Effect of earthworm presence on leaf carbon

   <bold>(B)</bold> content as well as their C/N ratio

   <sup>15</sup>N signature 
   <bold>(D)</bold>. Estimated marginal means and confidence intervals are shown in black (after being back-transformed), while data points were included in the background in gray. The conditional 
   <italic>R</italic>
   <sup>2</sup> as well as the 
   <italic>p</italic>-values for each factor are based on linear mixed effect models. When the interaction between earthworm treatment and species identity were significant, 
   <italic>post hoc</italic> test results are also presented: different letters show significant differences among species within each earthworm treatment. Number of observations per species and treatment: 18, except for 
   <italic>S. leave</italic> in the control treatment, where there are 17 observations.
