One explanation for these community changes is the effects of earthworms on the reproduction, recruitment, and development of plant species. However, few studies have investigated functional trait responses of native plants to earthworm invasion to explain the mechanisms underlying community changes. In a mesocosm (Ecotron) experiment, we set up a plant community composed of two herb and two grass species commonly found in northern North American forests under two earthworm treatments (presence vs. absence). We measured earthworm effects on above- and belowground plant biomass and functional traits after 3 months of experiment. Our results showed that earthworm presence did not significantly affect plant community biomass and cover. Furthermore, only four out of the fifteen above- and belowground traits measured were affected by earthworm presence. While some traits, such as the production of ramets, the carbon and nitrogen content of leaves, responded similarly between and within functional groups in the presence or absence of earthworms, we observed opposite responses for other traits, such as height, specific leaf area, and root length within some functional groups in the presence of earthworms. Plant trait responses were thus species-specific, although the two grass species showed a more pronounced response to earthworm presence with changes in their leaf traits than herb species. Overall, earthworms affected some functional traits related to resource uptake abilities of plants and thus could change plant competition outcomes over time, which could be an explanation of plant community changes observed in invaded ecosystems.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>biological invasion</kwd><kwd>biotic interactions</kwd><kwd>exotic earthworms</kwd><kwd>iDiv Ecotron</kwd><kwd>plant functional traits</kwd><kwd>plant&#x02013;soil interactions</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">European Research Council<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100000781</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001659</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn003">Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001659</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="93"/><page-count count="17"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Biological invasions are one of the most important threats to native biodiversity (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Davis, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">Wardle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">D&#x000ed;az et al., 2019</xref>). Among them, invasive ecosystem engineers, such as earthworms, can be particularly harmful (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Bohlen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Frelich et al., 2019</xref>). They affect soil properties (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Ferlian et al., 2020</xref>), native soil fauna (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Eisenhauer, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Ferlian et al., 2018</xref>), and plant biodiversity (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Craven et al., 2017</xref>), with consequences for other trophic levels and ecosystem services (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Frelich et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). These effects are even stronger when recipient ecosystems lack functionally similar native soil fauna (<xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">Wardle et al., 2011</xref>), such as the case for earthworms in many regions in northern North America. There, the native earthworm fauna is assumed to have disappeared during the last glaciation, prior to the recent introduction of exotic earthworm species &#x0223c;400 years ago (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Bohlen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">James and Hendrix, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Hendrix et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>A large portion of previous research on the ecosystem consequences of earthworm invasion in northern North America has focused on plant community composition and diversity (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Hale et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Nuzzo et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Hopfensperger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Drouin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Craven et al., 2017</xref>). The direct and indirect mechanisms behind observed plant community changes are manifold. Invasive earthworms influence seed bank composition, seed recruitment, and the development and survival of seedlings (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Hopfensperger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Clause et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Dobson and Blossey, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Nuzzo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Cassin and Kotanen, 2016</xref>). The outcome of these earthworm&#x02013;seed interactions may depend on the morphological and chemical traits of seeds (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Eisenhauer et al., 2009c</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Clause et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Moreover, invasive earthworms can further alter the plant functional traits of native plants. Exotic earthworms induce changes in the above- and belowground biomass (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Hale et al., 2008</xref>), stem height, number of leaves and culms (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">D&#x000e1;valos et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), nutrient concentrations of tissues (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Dobson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">Richardson et al., 2018</xref>), as well as myccorhizae association (<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Paudel et al., 2016</xref>). However, plant responses depend on the identity of the plant species and their functional groups (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Kreuzer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Eisenhauer and Scheu, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Coulis et al., 2014</xref>), and may further vary according to the species&#x02019; phenotypic plasticity. Currently, we lack information about potential changes of a set of plant functional traits to better understand plant responses to exotic earthworm presence, and consequently the mechanisms behind native plant community changes.</p><p>Earthworms are likely to alter soil nutrient availability and dynamics, such as changing the spatial distribution of nutrients from homogeneous to patchy (<xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">Shuster et al., 2001</xref>) or the distribution between soil layers (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Ferlian et al., 2020</xref>). Besides, invasive earthworms were shown to increase the drainage/leaching of soil nutrients in their burrows (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Larson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Eisenhauer et al., 2012a</xref>). Thus, we could expect that plant root traits respond to these earthworm-induced soil modifications, and that the changes in native plant community composition due to earthworm invasion are related to their selective effects on particular nutrient resource uptake strategies of plants (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Andriuzzi et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Indeed, some plant species, such as the native species <italic>Achillea millefolium</italic>, were shown to place their roots inside the burrows of exotic earthworms (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Cameron et al., 2014</xref>). As a consequence, exotic earthworms may specifically foster plant species with the highest ability to take up resources in their burrows and that have the highest plasticity in their functional traits. Such plant species are likely to be located toward the &#x02018;fast end&#x02019; of the whole-plant economic spectrum (<xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">Reich, 2014</xref>). Fast-growing species are characterized by, e.g., a low leaf dry matter content, high specific leaf area and nitrogen content in leaves (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Craine, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Donovan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">Reich, 2014</xref>), as well as a high specific root length and percentage of fine roots (<xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">Tjoelker et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">Roumet et al., 2016</xref>), with these characteristics being linked to high nutrient uptake and assimilation abilities. Consequently, earthworm-induced habitat changes could favor species with high adaptation and resource competition abilities under high resource conditions, such as fast-growing species like nitrophilous graminoid species (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Craven et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Here, using a plant functional trait approach and plant species originating from the understory community of a North American boreal forest, we studied plant species responses to exotic earthworms to advance our understanding of the mechanisms behind native plant community changes due to earthworm invasion. We hypothesize that (i) earthworms will increase plant community biomass and cover (mostly driven by a positive response of grasses) by increasing soil nutrient availability; (ii) earthworms will mainly affect the traits related to resource uptake (e.g., height, specific leaf area, and specific root length); and (iii) plant functional trait responses will vary according to plant species identity but will be more pronounced in grass species (i.e., fast-growing species) than in herb species.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2.SS1"><title>Experimental Design</title><p>We investigated how exotic earthworms affect plant functional traits in an indoor mesocosm experiment. We simulated the conditions of a well-studied Canadian aspen forest that is known to experience earthworm invasion and subsequent shifts in plant communities (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Eisenhauer et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2009d</xref>; <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">Straube et al., 2009</xref>). The experiment was conducted at the iDiv Ecotron of the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig in Germany (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Eisenhauer and T&#x000fc;rke, 2018</xref>). We used twelve EcoUnits (i.e., experimental units) set up in an air temperature-controlled environment. For each of the EcoUnits, the air temperature was on average 18.5 &#x000b1; 2.3&#x000b0;C at day (&#x000b1; sd) and 15.7 &#x000b1; 1.7&#x000b0;C at night (mean &#x000b1; sd), in a 16 h day/8 h night cycle, with a light intensity of around 400 &#x003bc;mol m<sup>&#x02013;2</sup> s<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> of photosynthetic photon flux density at the soil surface. The soil temperature was on average 17.1 &#x000b1; 1&#x000b0;C. The EcoUnits were irrigated using a sprinkler system delivering 1 L of tap water in &#x0223c;1 min, every 6 h. The amount of tap water used was adjusted regularly and simultaneously for each EcoUnit and ranged between 0.5 L to 1 L in order to keep the volumetric soil water content lower than 40%.</p><p>The bottom part of each EcoUnit (inner dimension (L &#x000d7; W &#x000d7; H): 1.24 &#x000d7; 1.24 &#x000d7; 0.8 m) was filled with 1.23 m<sup>3</sup> of sterilized topsoil (pH = 7.05; C:N = 9.30) provided by Bauzentrum Farys GmbH, Laucha. Prior to filling the EcoUnits, the soil was sterilized by steam heating (120&#x000b0;C for 1 h) and was then heavily watered to drain the nutrients resulting from the sterilization procedure. Afterward, the soil was re-inoculated with a microbial wash of the soil from the earthworm-free area of the above-mentioned aspen forest in Kananaskis Valley (Alberta, Canada) to introduce soil microbial communities without any co-evolutionary history with European earthworms. To do so, Canadian soil was collected in the field, shipped to Germany in a cooling box, sieved (4 mm mesh size), and homogenized. We then mixed 380 g of this soil with 300 mL of tap water and homogenized and sieved (125 &#x003bc;m mesh size) the solution. The extracted solution was re-diluted with 100 ml of tap water and then distributed homogeneously on the topsoil of each EcoUnit.</p><p>The aboveground community consisted of four Canadian native plant species (grasses and herbs) and two native tree species. The seeds of grasses [<italic>Calamagrostis canadensis</italic> (Michx.) and <italic>Bromus ciliatus</italic> (L.)] were purchased from Prairie Moon Nursery (MN, United States) and the herbs [<italic>Symphyotrichum laeve</italic> (L.) and <italic>A. millefolium</italic> (L.)] from the nursery Wild About Flowers (AB, Canada). While native populations of <italic>A. millefolium</italic> occur in North America, exotic populations originating from Europe have also established, leading to a possible hybridization and thus difficulty to distinguish them morphologically (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Mulligan and Bassett, 1959</xref>; <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">Warwick and Black, 1982</xref>). Therefore, the reader should note that we cannot be sure to have sown native seeds of <italic>A. millefolium</italic> in the present study. The tree species <italic>Populus balsamifera</italic> (L.) and <italic>Populus tremuloides</italic> (Michx.) came from the tree nursery Pflanzenhandel Winkler Gbr (Germany). After careful washing of the roots with tap water to avoid the introduction of soil fauna into the EcoUnits, two individuals of each of the two tree species were planted diagonally at a distance of around 85 cm in each of the EcoUnits, adding up to four tree individuals in each EcoUnit, with one tree individual in the center of each quarter. Dead trees were replaced during the first 5 weeks and were harvested after 16 weeks of the experiment. Although the presence of trees was important to simulate the conditions in the target forest, tree responses to earthworms were not investigated in the present study, whereas we used the dry weight of the tree biomass produced per EcoUnit (dried at 60&#x000b0;C for 72 h, and including the biomass of trees re-sproutings) as a covariate in our models to explain plant trait- and community responses. The tree performance assessments had a different focus than the study of herbaceous plant traits (<xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">Thakur et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The herbaceous plant community was planted approximately 1 month after the last tree replacement to avoid disturbance due to the replacement of dead trees. The seedlings constituting the herbaceous community were planted according to two random patterns of the plant community mixture. In both patterns, the plant community consisted of 50% grasses and 50% herbs, with herbs and grasses planted in an alternate order (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">Supplementary Material 1</xref>). These patterns were set to introduce heterogeneity in the location of the different plant species of the plant understory community. Species within functional groups were randomly distributed to functional group locations in each pattern, keeping the number of individuals per species and EcoUnit constant (36 individuals per species, thus 144 individuals per community in one EcoUnit). The plant seedlings were pre-grown in a greenhouse for about 16&#x02013;28 days at 21&#x000b0;C at day and 15&#x000b0;C at night, and were transplanted at 10 cm distances into each EcoUnit forming the experimental plant communities. The average height (&#x000b1; sd) of transplanted seedlings depended on the plant growth forms. Overall seedlings of herb species such as <italic>S. laeve</italic> that form a basal rosette (1.6 &#x000b1; 0.6 cm) were smaller than that of grass species such as <italic>B. ciliatus</italic> that grow up erected/upright (15.5 &#x000b1; 3.3 cm). <italic>Achillea millefolium</italic> (8.2 &#x000b1; 3.5 cm) and <italic>C. canadensis</italic> (12.4 &#x000b1; 3.7 cm) had intermediate height. Dead seedlings were replaced during the first 3 weeks, and weeds originating from the seed bank were removed regularly. None of the experimental treatments influenced the survival of the planted individuals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS2">Supplementary Material 2</xref>).</p><p>The earthworm treatment was applied 16 days after planting the trees. Earthworms were added to half of the EcoUnits (<italic>n</italic> = 6 without earthworms and <italic>n</italic> = 6 with earthworms) and corresponded to a mixture of two ecological groups of earthworms to simulate the earthworm community and functional composition of northern North American ecosystems (<xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">Straube et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Eisenhauer et al., 2011</xref>). To the six EcoUnits with earthworm presence, we added earthworm species from the Lumbricidae family, invasive in North America with a density of around 43 ind.m<sup>&#x02013;2</sup>: 50 individuals of <italic>Lumbricus terrestris</italic> (L.) (anecic; total average fresh weight &#x000b1; sd: 167.31 &#x000b1; 0.92 g) and 15 individuals of <italic>Aporrectodea rosea</italic> (Savigny) (endogeic; 4.02 &#x000b1; 0.10 g) were introduced. Earthworms were purchased from commercial suppliers (TZ &#x02013; Terraristik Zentrum, Germany) or collected in a garden in the vicinity of Leipzig (Germany) and kept in the fridge (12&#x000b0;C) until use. To control for the potential effect of soil in earthworm guts (including nutrients and microorganisms), 4 g of soil previously used for earthworm storage was added to each EcoUnit of the control treatment without earthworms. During the experiment, we added litter on the top of the soil to provide food to earthworms and simulate natural conditions. Three times, 50 g of litter collected from <italic>Populus nigra var. italica</italic> stands in the vicinity of Leipzig (Germany) were added to each EcoUnit. The litter material was cut into small pieces of about 2 cm in diameter and homogeneously distributed on the soil surface. The last litter addition (this time a total of 100 g per EcoUnit) was done 40 days before the end of the experiment and consisted of a mixture of <sup>15</sup>N labeled and non-labeled poplar litter. The mixture contained 5% of labeled material (4.2 &#x000b1; 3.8 atom% <sup>15</sup>N) and was used to explore potential earthworm-induced changes in nutrient mineralization and uptake by plants based on <sup>15</sup>N signatures in plant leaves.</p><p>At the end of the experiment, we verified that earthworms successfully established and were active in our EcoUnits. Across the replicates of the earthworm treatment, we counted on average 35 &#x000b1; 2.61 casts per m<sup>2</sup> (mean &#x000b1; sd) produced by the earthworms at the surface of the soil. We then assessed earthworm abundances by performing earthworm extraction in two opposite quarters of each EcoUnit, using the hot mustard method (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Eisenhauer et al., 2008</xref>). The mustard solution was prepared by diluting 100 g of mustard powder in 10 L of tap water. In each quarter of the EcoUnit, 5 l of the mustard solution was applied to a circle of 50 cm in diameter. Earthworms appearing at the soil surface were collected during 15 min. Then, the procedure was repeated by adding another 5 l of mustard solution, and earthworms were collected for another 15 min. Then, they were sorted, counted, and weighed according to ecological groups. We extracted almost half (&#x0223c;42%) of the earthworms that were initially inoculated. Across the EcoUnits where earthworms were added, the density of earthworms extracted was around 18.3 &#x000b1; 4.9 ind.m<sup>2</sup> (mean &#x000b1; sd), and their total biomass was around 50.1 &#x000b1; 9.9 g.m<sup>2</sup> (mean &#x000b1; sd). However, the density of earthworms in the mesocosms is probably underestimated, as the mustard extraction method is not comprehensive and also less efficient for endogeic species (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Chan and Munro, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Lawrence and Bowers, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Guti&#x000e9;rrez-L&#x000f3;pez et al., 2016</xref>).

From this homogenized, sieved soil, 45 g were used for nutrient and microbial analyses (see &#x0201c;Abiotic and Biotic Soil Properties&#x0201d;); and the remaining soil was washed over a 63-&#x003bc;m sieve under tap water to collect the roots.

The biomass of the different types of roots was measured.

The soil cubes of two samples from the species <italic>S. laeve</italic> in EcoUnit 1 had a height of around 7 cm, due to the loss of soil at the bottom part. They were included in the analyses as the root system is mainly located in the upper &#x0223c;10 cm of the soil, and these samples were not detected as outliers in further analyses. When not processed immediately, soil cubes with roots of plant individuals were stored in the dark in the fridge (4&#x000b0;C) before being processed (maximum 3 days after collection). Soil cubes were soaked in tap water. The soil was then washed over a sieve with a 1 mm mesh, and only roots connected to the base of the plant were collected for further analyses allowing us to confirm the identity of species. The same procedure as the one applied to community roots samples was applied to the roots of the collected individual. Then, from the fine roots sample of each individual, a representative sub-sample of about one eighth [on average 0.43 &#x000b1; 0.43 g of fresh mass (mean &#x000b1; sd)] was used to measure fine root traits. When too little root material was collected (which was mainly the case for the species <italic>S. laeve</italic>), we measured fine root traits using the whole pool of fine roots of the individual. Each sub-sample of the fresh fine roots at the community and individual level were scanned with an Epson Perfection 11000XL Scanner (Epson America, Inc., CA, United States) at 600 dpi in grayscale. After scanning, all root samples (coarse, fine, and fine roots scanned) were oven-dried at 60&#x000b0;C for at least 72 h and weighed. Root scans of the community and each individual were analyzed with WinRhizo (Version 2013e Pro, Regent Instruments Inc., Canada), and root traits were calculated for the community and individuals.

These plant species- and trait-specific responses to earthworm presence are subtle but may alter competitive interactions between plant species and should thus be further explored as potential mechanism underlying widely observed plant community changes in response to earthworm invasion (e.g., <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Hale et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Craven et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Several studies have shown that exotic and native earthworms stimulate the productivity of different plant species and communities; but also neutral effects were observed (<xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">Scheu and Parkinson, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">Scheu, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">D&#x000e1;valos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">van Groenigen et al., 2014</xref>).

This study thus confirms results from previous studies that earthworms can impact plant height (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Haimi and Einbork, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Eisenhauer et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">D&#x000e1;valos et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Agapit et al., 2018</xref>) and demonstrates that earthworms could affect plant resource acquisition and competitive abilities by inducing changes in leaf traits, which have not been previously described. However, we did not observe any significant effect of earthworm presence on the reproductive plant traits (i.e., the proportion of flowering individuals and number of ramets). Diverse results were observed in previous studies. For example, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">D&#x000e1;valos et al. (2013)</xref> also showed that the probability of flowering was not affected by exotic earthworms, while the number of culms produced by sedges decreased. By contrast, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Blume-Werry et al. (2020)</xref> showed positive and neutral effects of exotic earthworm presence on the production of floral shoots by native plants, while <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">Zaller and Arnone (1999)</xref> measured a higher number of ramets produced by native plant species close to native earthworm casts. Similar to plant biomass responses, earthworm effects on reproductive plant traits may vary with the abiotic and biotic context though. For instance, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Eisenhauer and Scheu (2008)</xref> observed neutral effects of native earthworms on the number of legume flower heads in the absence of grasses, while earthworms reduced their number in the presence of grasses by fostering the competitive strength of grasses against legumes. Other biotic factors such as the composition and diversity of the earthworm community (e.g., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Hale, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Craven et al., 2017</xref>) could also have differently affected the trait responses of the plant species studied.</p><p>In the present study, earthworms did not enhance the N content of the plant species, which is in line with some previous studies with native earthworms (<xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">Wurst et al., 2005</xref>) and a meta-analysis (<xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">van Groenigen et al., 2014</xref>), but is in contrast to some others showing that earthworms increase nitrogen concentrations in grass shoots (<xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">Wurst et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Eisenhauer and Scheu, 2008</xref>). An increase in leaf tissue nitrogen concentrations could also have been expected, as earthworm activity (e.g., enhanced nitrogen mineralization) and also dead/decomposing earthworms would increase plant-available nitrogen (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Barois et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Kos et al., 2017</xref>). The lack of change in leaf nutrient content may be linked to the few changes in root traits between earthworm treatments, as roots have an important role in nutrient uptake and transfer to aboveground organs (<xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Oaks and Hirel, 1985</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Eissenstat, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Bloom et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Brown et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Peel, 2013</xref>). Surprisingly, although earthworms are known to decrease the spatial homogeneity of soil resource distribution (<xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">Shuster et al., 2001</xref>), we did not observe a strong modification of the plant belowground traits at the species and community level, which differed from what was shown in previous studies. <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Blume-Werry et al. (2020)</xref> showed that fine root growth of the plant community was higher in the presence of exotic earthworms in meadows after 55 days and after 103 days of experiment independent of the vegetation type (meadows vs. heath, with plant communities mainly composed of forbs or shrubs, respectively, and grasses) than in the absence of earthworms. <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Cameron et al. (2014)</xref> showed that the proportion of <italic>A. millefolium</italic> roots present in exotic earthworms burrows was important during the first month of growth, but root growth in soil cracks became similarly important after 2 and 3 months. These authors also observed an opposite pattern for the root distribution of <italic>Campanula rotundifolia</italic>: although its root occurrence was similar in cracks and burrows after 1 month of experiment, it decreased in exotic earthworm burrows after 2 and 3 months (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Cameron et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, the minor responses of root traits to earthworms observed in the present study could be explained by potential transient effects, which may also be plant species-specific due to differences in the growth rate and growth strategy. Thus, root trait changes induced by earthworms could have taken place at earlier stages of plant growth, with a difference between treatments being less pronounced after 3 months of experiment. Future studies may thus explore potential temporal dynamics of earthworm effects on plant traits. Another explanation for minor root trait responses could be that soil nutrients (e.g., nitrogen) were not limiting enough to induce different responses of the root traits between the two treatments. Thus, plants which could preferentially forage in the burrows of earthworms would not take any advantage of doing this against plants that would not express this behavior, and thus that earthworm effects on root foraging in burrows would be more visible under limiting soil nutrient levels (<xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">van Groenigen et al., 2014</xref>). This could also explain why we did not observe any significant changes in the nutrient content and microbial community properties in the upper soil layer in response to earthworms, which is in contrast to previous meta-analyses (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Ferlian et al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Invasive earthworms were shown to have opposing effects on organic and mineral soil layers for carbon and nitrogen concentrations (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Ferlian et al., 2020</xref>), and their effects on soil microorganisms were neutral when the different soil layers were pooled (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Ferlian et al., 2018</xref>). Although we cannot exclude that the duration of the experiment may have been too short to observe the effect of earthworms in the large volume of soil (&#x0223c;1 m<sup>3</sup>), the analysis of soil properties across all soil layers could also have masked the effect of earthworms on the nutrient content and microbial community properties.</p><p>Other root traits could also be investigated in further studies. Mycorrhizal associations deserve some attention, as they play a key role in plant development and nutrient acquisition and were shown to be significantly affected by invasive earthworms (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Lawrence et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Paudel et al., 2016</xref>). The abilities of plants to spread their root system laterally or their rooting depth may also have some importance in the belowground plant response to earthworm presence (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Eisenhauer et al., 2012b</xref>). Species with a higher density of roots in the upper soil layer or a strong lateral spread of their roots might take advantage of being closer to earthworm casts and middens at the soil surface that are known to affect plant growth. For example, studies showed that the proximity of the plant to native earthworm casts enhanced plant growth and ramet production (<xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">Zaller and Arnone, 1999</xref>), which could be explained by the presence of hormone-like molecules regulating plant growth in earthworm casts (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Brown et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Puga-Freitas et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4.SS2"><title>More Pronounced Responses of Grasses Than of Herbs to Earthworm Presence</title><p>Our study demonstrated that earthworm effects on plant functional traits were plant species-specific. Although we only tested two grass and two herb species in the present study, earthworm effects tended to be stronger in grasses than in herbs (hypothesis iii). The more pronounced response of grasses to earthworm presence can be explained by their rapid growth and their high resource competition abilities under high resource conditions (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Linder et al., 2018</xref>), such as those observed under earthworms presence (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Eisenhauer and Scheu, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, however, the two grass species studied showed opposite responses to earthworms. Earthworms induced an increase of <italic>C. canadensis</italic> height and leaf dry matter content, while it decreased its specific leaf area and total root length. A possible explanation for this result is a change in <italic>C. canadensis</italic>&#x02019; growth strategy due to the potential changes in the spatial distribution of soil nutrients resulting from earthworm activity. More precisely, <italic>C. canadensis</italic> could have shifted its biomass allocation from root production toward apical growth and more structural/less flimsy tissues, rather than into the lateral spread (i.e., ramet production) or reproduction (i.e., flower production) that did not change with earthworm presence. However, although this species showed a high leaf <sup>15</sup>N signature that was not affected by earthworm presence, its leaf <sup>15</sup>N signature was slightly positively correlated to the height in earthworm presence only (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS6">Supplementary Material 6</xref>), which suggests that <italic>C. canadensis</italic> could take advantage of the nutrients coming from the litter decomposed by earthworms or found in their casts. This result is also corroborated by the leaf <sup>15</sup>N signature of this species, which was negatively correlated to its specific root length. The increase of the leaf <sup>15</sup>N signature when the cost of constructing roots decreased and root systems were less developed (i.e., low SRL) suggests that <italic>C. canadensis</italic> could preferentially forage in the nutrient-rich burrows or casts of earthworms. Notably, although we did not observe any significant earthworm effects on soil N content at the end of the study, this gross measurement would not be able to reflect the concentrations of plant-available ammonium and nitrate as well as potential temporal or spatial differences in nutrient availability in response to earthworm activity.</p><p>In contrast to <italic>C. canadensis</italic>, <italic>B. ciliatus</italic> showed a higher specific leaf area and a lower leaf dry matter content in the presence of earthworms, while its height, ramet, and flower production, and root traits were unaffected by earthworms. This species probably directed its resources toward the production of a more costly and dense root system (i.e., with a higher root diameter, dry matter content, and tissue density) instead of favoring its aboveground growth or investing into reproduction. This shift of resource allocation to the root system was emphasized in presence of earthworms where plant height and shoot:root ratio were significantly correlated with root dry matter content and root tissue density (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS6">Supplementary Material 6</xref>). Furthermore, we did not observe any significant correlation between the &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N signature of <italic>B. ciliatus</italic> and its height or its shoot:root ratio nor any other traits in the presence of earthworms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS6">Supplementary Material 6</xref>). To sum up, our results indicate that <italic>B. ciliatus</italic> did not preferentially forage in earthworm burrows or casts, and that its development and thus changes of leaf traits were rather independent of nutrients coming from the litter decomposed by earthworms or their casts. This result is in line with the observation made by <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">Zaller and Arnone (1999)</xref>, who did not observe any significant relationship between native earthworm activity (i.e., surface cast production) and the growth (i.e., production of ramets) of the native congeneric species <italic>B. erectus</italic>. Thus, grasses were shown to respond differently to the presence of earthworms, even if both showed stronger responses than herbs in the present study.</p><p>Indeed, among the measured traits, only the &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N signature in <italic>A. millefolium</italic> was significantly affected by earthworm presence. However, the two herbs species studied showed opposite responses to earthworm presence. While we observed a strong decrease of the &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N signature in leaves of <italic>A. millefolium</italic> when earthworms were present, this value was not correlated to any of the other traits studied (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS6">Supplementary Material 6</xref>). As <italic>A. millefolium</italic> has been reported to preferentially forage in exotic earthworms burrows (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Cameron et al., 2014</xref>), we would have expected to observe an effect of earthworms on various root traits as well as significant correlations between these root traits (i.e., SRL) and the &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N signature in leaves when earthworms were present. Our results were thus unexpected and could potentially be related to the fact that exotic earthworms can also increase the leaching of soil nutrients through their burrows that function as preferential flow pathways of soil surface water (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Ferlian et al., 2020</xref>). This phenomenon is particularly pronounced for the vertical burrows of anecic earthworms like <italic>L. terrestris</italic> that dominated the earthworm community in the present study.</p><p>In contrast to <italic>A. millefolium</italic>, the development of <italic>S. laeve</italic> was correlated to its root traits. This species overall invested more of its resources into the production of belowground costly tissue, such as roots with large root diameter and high dry matter content, than in its aboveground development. This response was found to be most accentuated in the presence of earthworms as indicated by the positive correlation between the &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N signature with the root diameter of <italic>S. laeve</italic> in the presence of earthworms, as well as by the negative correlation of the &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N signature with its ramet production, and the non-significant although marginally positive correlation with its height (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS6">Supplementary Material 6</xref>). Furthermore, the negative correlation between &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N signature in <italic>S. laeve</italic> in the presence of earthworms and its specific root length also suggests that this species could preferentially forage in the nutrient-rich burrows or casts of earthworms. However, the consequences of this strategy in response to earthworms remain to be investigated in long-term studies and under natural field conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study provides novel insights into the trait responses of different plant species under earthworm invasion and indicates that these changes of plant strategies are not necessarily mediated by the effects of earthworms on gross soil abiotic properties and on the soil microbial activity or community structure. These results advance our understanding of the mechanisms behind plant community changes in response to earthworm invasion. Plant responses to earthworms were species-specific, and the development strategies of grass species were observed to be more likely affected by earthworm presence than that of herbs. However, even if the grass species responded faster to earthworm presence, herb responses to invasive earthworms may only be pronounced with time, calling for long-term studies. Indeed, the slow development due to the high costs of tissue production in slower-growing species may have masked potential beneficial effects of earthworms on their development in our experiment, which may have been too short to reflect potential beneficial effects.</p><p>Nevertheless, our results suggest that by modifying some plant strategies, earthworms could potentially change the outcome of interspecific competition between plants in the longer term and may lead to a shift in plant species and functional group dominance in the plant community, as commonly observed in field studies on plant community responses to earthworm invasion (e.g., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Craven et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, the strong adaptability and trait responses of the grass species to earthworm presence could explain why grasses commonly benefit in the early stages of earthworm invasion and the associated plant community changes (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Craven et al., 2017</xref>). However, the potential long-term effects of earthworms on plant traits and strategies remain to be investigated, as we showed that earthworms may also have beneficial effects on the resource uptake strategies of some herb species. Furthermore, the observed opposite patterns of response within each of the two plant functional groups in the presence of earthworms, suggest that the use of plant functional groups to characterize the consequences and mechanisms of earthworm invasion for plant community composition may mask some important differences and that approaches at the species level should be preferred in future long-term studies. Although with four plant species, we were unable to rigorously test this concept in the present work, the plant economics spectrum (<xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">Reich, 2014</xref>) may provide a powerful conceptual backbone to guide hypotheses of future research on invasive earthworm effects on native plant species&#x02019; strategies and communities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="S6"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>The datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories.
