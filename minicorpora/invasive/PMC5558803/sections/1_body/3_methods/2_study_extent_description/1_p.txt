0: The occurrence data of  Heracleumsosnowskyi were collected from an area of approximately 19, 000 km 2 (Figure  1).
1: Most of the data were collected from the capital area of Komi, Syktyvkar ( 6139.95'N, 5049.53'E) as well as along the roads at a distance of 300 km from Syktyvkar, the directions of which coincide with the flow direction of the major rivers Vychegda and Sysola belonging to the Northern Dvina basin.
2: A separate cluster of the data was collected from a 664 km (orthodromic) distance in the territory and suburb of Inta city, located near the Arctic Circle ( 66 1.87N, 60 8.72E).
3: A pronounced sampling bias should be considered before using the data for the species distribution modelling.
4: Data were collected close to the settlements or the roads connecting them, which is a travel time bias ( Fourcade et al.
5: 2014).
6: In the case of  Heracleumsosnowskyi, such a sampling bias may coincide with the actual factors determining the dispersal of the plants of this species.
7: In most cases, roadsides are the optimal habitats for this species as they are open and well-lighted with adequate moisture due to the roadside drainage systems.
8: Moreover, the air flow creates favourable conditions for the spread of the plants.
