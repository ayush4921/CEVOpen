0: Two groups of predictors were used.
1: Group 1: the state of the earths surface, with a spatial resolution of 1 second ( 30 m) per pixel (data was collected for Plot 1only): VEG = vegetation cover map derived from classification of satellite images (20 classes); ROAD = proximity map to the nearest road; AGRO = proximity map to the nearest borders of agricultural areas.
2: Group 2: bioclimatic variables are derived from the monthly temperature and rainfall values obtained from WorldClim ( Hijmans et al.
3: 2005;  http://www.worldclim.org/bioclim) with resolution of 30 second ( 1000 m) per pixel (data was collected for Plot 1 and Plot 2): BIO1 = Annual Mean Temperature; BIO2 = Mean Diurnal Range; BIO3 = Isothermality; BIO4 = Temperature Seasonality; BIO5 = Max Temperature of Warmest Month; BIO6 = Min Temperature of Coldest Month; BIO7 = Temperature Annual Range (BIO5-BIO6); BIO8 = Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter; BIO9 = Mean Temperature of Driest Quarter; BIO10 = Mean Temperature of Warmest Quarter; BIO11 = Mean Temperature of Coldest Quarter; BIO12 = Annual Precipitation; BIO13 = Precipitation of Wettest Month; BIO14 = Precipitation of Driest Month; BIO15 = Precipitation Seasonality (Coefficient of Variation); BIO16 = Precipitation of Wettest Quarter; BIO17 = Precipitation of Driest Quarter; BIO18 = Precipitation of Warmest Quarter; BIO19 = Precipitation of Coldest Quarter.
