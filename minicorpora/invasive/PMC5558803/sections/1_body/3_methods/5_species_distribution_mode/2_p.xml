<p>Two groups of predictors were used. Group 1: the state of the earth’s surface, with a spatial resolution of 1 second (≈ 30 m) per pixel (data was collected for Plot 1only): VEG = vegetation cover map derived from classification of satellite images (20 classes); ROAD = proximity map to the nearest road; AGRO = proximity map to the nearest borders of agricultural areas. Group 2: bioclimatic variables are derived from the monthly temperature and rainfall values obtained from WorldClim (
