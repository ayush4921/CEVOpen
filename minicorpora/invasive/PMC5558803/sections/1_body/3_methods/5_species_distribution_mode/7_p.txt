0: Model fitting at Plot 1 and Plot 2 with bioclimatic predictors revealed a statistically significant relationship with eight predictors: BIO2, BIO4, BIO5, BIO6, BIO7, BIO10, BIO12 and BIO17.
1: The model with all these predictors showed AUC value 0.99.
2: Prediction with the model obtained within Plot 2 allowed to iden tify the putative northern  Heracleumsosnowskyi range boundary  67.2000N, within the borders of the valley of the Pechora river (Fig.
3: 3).
4: According to the model, the values of bioclimatic variables in the areas with maximum probability of  Heracleumsosnowskyi presence were as follows (mean and standard deviation): BIO2: 8.3  0.2 C, BIO4: 112  1 C, BIO5: 21.2  0.6 C, BIO6: -21.9  0.3 C, BIO10: 3.6  0.6 C, BIO12: 567  24 mm.
