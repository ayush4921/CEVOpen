0: Model fitting with the predictors VEG, ROAD and AGRO showed statistically significant (p< 0.0001) relationship with the dependent variable ( Heracleumsosnowskyi presence in the given point).
1: ROC analysis showed that AUC value for the regression model was 0.92).
2: These results were supported by field observations, invasion history and ways of  Heracleumsosnowskyi seed dispersal.
3: The plant occupies habitats with disturbed soil cover, spreading rapidly along roads, due to the transfer of seeds by air flow, avoids shaded and dry habitats (Fig.
