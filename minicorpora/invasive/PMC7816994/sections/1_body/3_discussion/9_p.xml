<p>The assessment of our research findings looks different when the results of the analyses are compared with the optimal or toxic content elaborated for deciduous trees by Jones et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0245398.ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>] and by Kabata-Pendias and Pendias [
 <xref rid="pone.0245398.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. The measurements made on the trees growing along the streets in Wrocław showed that the content of elements was toxic (Fe and Pb), elevated (Zn) or it exceeded the optimal amount (Mn). The content of Pb in the samples of plants growing in the park in Wrocław and in the street in Poznań was also toxic. However, the content of cadmium in the

 <italic>pseudoacacia</italic> leaves was elevated, but not toxic.
