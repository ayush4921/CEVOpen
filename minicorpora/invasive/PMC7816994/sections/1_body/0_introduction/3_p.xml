 <italic>Robinia pseudoacacia</italic> L. (known as ‘black locust’ or ‘false acacia’) is an interesting example of how one plant species can be considered invasive in one environment and very useful in another. It is a medium-size (12-18m in height), hardwood forest tree developing extensive root systems. The radial root extent is about 1–1.5 times the tree height. The species originates from North America. It has spread worldwide due to its fast growth, rapid maturity [
 <xref rid="pone.0245398.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], vigorous sprouting [
 <xref rid="pone.0245398.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and reproduction by underground runners [
 <xref rid="pone.0245398.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Successful spreading of black locust is influenced also by the fact that disturbance promotes the growth of clones and leads to an increase in the number of ramets [
 <xref rid="pone.0245398.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Black locust produces allelopathic substances in bark and roots that inhibit growth of some other plants [

 <italic>Robinia</italic> trees have been widely planted, frequently escaped cultivation and therefore they are considered an invasive species in natural habitats [
 <xref rid="pone.0245398.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Being an invasive, non-native tree, black locust is not planted in Polish forests anymore [
 <xref rid="pone.0245398.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, for a long time it was recommended in urban areas as its invasiveness was less important there [
 <xref rid="pone.0245398.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0245398.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Currently the planting of non-native, invasive species is not recommended worldwide not only in forests but also in urban green space [
 <xref rid="pone.0245398.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Black locust is still a common tree in a large number of European cities [
 <xref rid="pone.0245398.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0245398.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Some specimens are old trees of high historical, aesthetical and landscape value. Sádlo et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0245398.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] proposed a stratified approach to 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>pseudoacacia</italic> management, which accounts for both the ecological and economic aspects of its occurrence. An approach to 
 <italic>Robinia</italic> in which the species is regarded as a noxious invader needs to be balanced with its integration into landscapes and wide social acceptance. Sjöman et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0245398.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] argued that as the availability of native tree species that are suitable for harsh urban environments depends on the richness of the regional tree flora. Regional context must be taken into consideration when selecting species. The limited abundance of Central European tree flora is discussed in the paper in the context of publications concerning Berlin, which is located 100 km away from the Polish border [

 <xref rid="pone.0245398.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The main message from the line of arguments given by Sjöman et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0245398.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] is that we cannot afford to exclude non-native tree species from urban green space.
