0: Black locust is usually considered to exhibit low susceptibility to diseases and pests because as an introduced species it probably has very few natural predators in Europe [ 27, 42 45].
1: The enemy release hypothesis suggests that one of the reasons for rapid and successful invasions by non-native species might be their escape from natural enemies [ 46 49].
2: The lower herbivore pressure in Europe compared to the native North American range is thought to be a contributing factor to the effective spread of the black locust in the invaded area [ 26, 27], in addition to its capacity for rapid reproduction.
3: However, a significant number of  R.  pseudoacacia trees in Poland show symptoms of pest and fungal pathogen activity.
4: Because some pathogens and pests develop well when temperature is low and humidity is high, while for others high temperature and low humidity are prerequisites, it seems obvious that climate warming may cause unexpected changes in their populations.
5: Consequently, the health of their host plants will be affected [ 50, 51].
