0: Difficult urban conditions such as low humidity and extreme temperatures, dry seasons, bad soil structure, pollution, soil salinity, limited space for the development of tree roots and crowns, insolation, and strong winds in street canyons negatively affect the health of trees [ 7, 10, 19 21].
1: The urban environment significantly impedes the introduction of trees in cities but paradoxically, trees are necessary to improve the urban ecosystem.
2: To avoid failures, tree species need to be carefully selected before they are planted in urban green spaces [ 19].
3: On the one hand, the importance of common species and ones that spontaneously appear in urban ecosystems is emphasised [ 22 24].
4: This is due to good adaptation to the local environment and positive ecological impact of native species.
5: On the other hand, introduced species often have traits that facilitate their adaptation to adverse environmental conditions [ 7].
