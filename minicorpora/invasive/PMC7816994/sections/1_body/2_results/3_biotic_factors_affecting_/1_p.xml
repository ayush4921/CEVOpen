<p>The composition of the entomofauna was the same in all of the research sites, but they differed in the intensity of pest infestation. There were symptoms of damage to black locust leaves caused by insects with biting mouthparts and by those with piercing and sucking mouthparts. Representatives of 5 orders of insects were identified (

 <italic>Aphis craccivora</italic> Koch. and 
 <italic>Appendiseta robiniae</italic> (Gilette). There were two leaf-mining insects of the Lepidoptera order: 
 <italic>Macrosaccus robiniella</italic> (Clemens) and 
 <italic>Parectopa robiniella</italic> (Clemens). 
 <italic>Obolodiplosis robiniae</italic> (Haldeman) of the Diptera order, 
 <italic>Nematus</italic> (Pteronidea) 
 <italic>tibialis</italic> Newman of the Hymenoptera order and 
 <italic>Sitona lineatus</italic> L. of the Coleoptera order bit the leaf tissue. During the observation, in addition to leaves, we examined trunks and low-lying tree branches, but no insect damage to these parts of trees was found.
