<p>Results of the CCA showed dependencies between: (A) the content of elements in leaves (Ca, Mn, Cu, Fe, Pb), the location of the trees in parks or streets, and their health (Q); (B) pests and diseases occurring on the trees, the location of the trees in parks or streets, and their health (Q); (C) the content of elements in leaves (Mn, Fe, Cu, Pb, Ca, Zn), the perimeter of the trees, pests and diseases occurring on the trees and their health (Q) (
