<p>The foliage of the trees growing in the areas adjacent to streets and in parks did not differ in content of nitrogen, phosphorus (except Wrocław), potassium, magnesium, or copper (

In all the cities the leaves of the plants exposed to higher levels of pollution caused by heavier car traffic contained significantly greater amounts of calcium, sodium, iron, zinc, and lead. There were similar dependencies observed for manganese and cadmium. Only in Wrocław the differences in the content of these elements in the leaves of the trees growing at the street and park sites were so big that they were statistically significant. The largest site-dependent differences in the chemical composition of leaves were found in Wrocław. For example, in comparison with the trees growing in the park, the samples of plant material collected from the trees growing along the streets contained 96% more iron and 444% more manganese. In Kraków and Poznań the differences were much smaller and did not exceed 60% for iron and 24% for manganese.
