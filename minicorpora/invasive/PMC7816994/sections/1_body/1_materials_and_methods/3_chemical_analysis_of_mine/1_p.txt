0: In late July 2018, 20 leaves were collected from each tree in each site: random samples from 25 branches on different sides and at different heights (13 m) in the crown, with single leaves collected from different places on the branches (top and middle).
1: The leaves were analysed chemically to assess the influence of the environment on the quality of the plants.
2: First, dust and other impurities were mechanically removed from the leaf surface.
3: Next, the samples were pre-dried at a temperature of 50C and ground in a mixer.
4: In order to assay the total content of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, and Na the plant material was digested in concentrated sulphuric acid with hydrogen peroxide.
5: To analyse the total Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Cd, and Pb content the plant material was digested in a mixture of concentrated (ultrapure) nitric and perchloric acids (analytically pure) at a 3:1 ratio.
6: After digestion the following assays were made: the total N content was assayed with the micro-Kjeldahl procedure; the P content was analysed with spectrophotometric methods; the concentrations of K, Ca, and Na were measured by means of flame photometry; and Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Pb, and Cd content were measured by means of flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry [ 59].
7: The accuracy of the measurements of heavy metals was tested by analysis of reference material certified by the Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM), Belgium.
8: The chemical composition of the leaves was analysed separately for each tree.
