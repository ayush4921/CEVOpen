0: The research was conducted on 10 specimens of black locust ( Robinia pseudoacacia L.) in each site (60 specimens in total).
1: The age of the trees was estimated at 70130 years, by assessing the diameter of the trunk [ 55, 56] and information on the date of the construction of the fortification objects they accompanied.
2: The median of their circumferences was 206.6 cm.
3: The trees selected for the study were several decades old so that the assessment of their health would not be impeded by the problems of young trees adapting to a new site and so as to focus the analysis on the most valuable specimens in the urban environment.
