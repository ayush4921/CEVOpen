0: The CVA resulted in 3 canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) models ( Fig 1).
1: Stepwise regression analysis was used to find which variables had the greatest influence on the health of the trees at the research sites.
2: All variables were assessed.
3: The ones that contributed most to the discrimination of the groups based on the p and F values for the variable under analysis were included in the model.
4: The process was repeated until the p value fell below 0.05 for the variable under analysis.
