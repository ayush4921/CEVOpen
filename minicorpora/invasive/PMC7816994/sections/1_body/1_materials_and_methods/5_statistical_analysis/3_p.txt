0: The statistical analyses and models were created using discriminant analysis.
1: The analyses checked which variables (macro- and microelements identified in the leaves of the trees growing at different sites) may affect the health of trees (Q) and the occurrence of diseases and pests.
2: The analyses also determined which species of pests and pathogens were more numerous at the research sites.
3: Canonical variate analysis (CVA), a canonical form of Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (LDA), was used to construct a model [ 60].
