0: Understanding how and why communities assemble and the role that plantplant interactions have on assembly is becoming increasingly important as communities experience changes to local climate, such as increases in the frequency and intensity of drought (He et al.,  2013; Ploughe et al.,  2019), landuse change (Houghton & Nassikas,  2017), and other disturbances (Chase,  2003), which can all result in increases in biological invasions and severely alter plant community assembly and function (Hess et al.,  2019; McNeely,  2006).
1: This is particularly relevant for heavily disturbed and invaded land, which are often more difficult to successfully restore.
2: Grassland ecosystems are of particular concern, which are being degraded rapidly through a variety of anthropogenic activities, are often heavily invaded as a result of these disturbances, and are one of the most sensitive ecosystems to altered climate (Newman et al.,  2014; Parks et al.,  2005; Prevey & Seastedt,  2014; Rinella et al.,  2016).
3: In semiarid grasslands, degradation can lead to sites that are dominated by annual forbs and grasses, including  Bromus tectorum, an earlyseral annual species (Briske et al.,  2005; Newman et al.,  2014; Suding et al.,  2004).
4: The use of ecological theory, such as priority effects, may be one technique to introduce more natives and fewer invasive species, improving restoration methods (Hess et al.,  2019; Ke & Letten,  2018).
