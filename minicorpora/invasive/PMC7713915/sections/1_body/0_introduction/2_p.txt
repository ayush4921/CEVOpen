0: The way in which plant communities assemble in a particular area has been debated for years and has generated several conceptual theories.
1: While there are many community assembly theories, one theory that is regaining interest is the concept of priority or founder effects (henceforth priority effects).
2: Priority effects explore how the arrival order of species into a community impacts plantplant interactions and community assembly (Drake,  1991; Eriksson & Erikson,  1998; Fukami et al.,  2016; Hess et al.,  2019; Ke & Letten,  2018).
3: Mechanisms driving priority affects appear to be a result of a combination of factors, including, the ability of earlyarriving species to reduce resources (nutrients, water, space, and light) preventing colonization from later arriving species (Fargione et al.,  2004; Fukami,  2015; Vannette & Fukami,  2014; Werner et al.,  2016).
4: These priority effects can have lasting effects on diversity, plant composition, and soils (biological, chemical, and physical properties), often resulting in altered ecosystem function (Chase,  2003; Fukami,  2015; Hess et al.,  2019; Ke & Letten,  2018).
5: However, it is difficult to predict how and when priority effects occur, as arrival order is often difficult to reconstruct in adequate detail (Fukami,  2015; Fukami et al.,  2016; Hess et al.,  2019).
