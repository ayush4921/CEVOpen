0: As a result of the limited experimental studies exploring priority effects on community assembly and plant invasions and to obtain greater control over the experiment, we conducted a greenhouse study that explores how the arrival order of an invasive grass,  Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass), affects productivity and community composition when grown with native, perennial grasses from western North America.
1: Bromus tectorum is found throughout Canada and the United States and is considered of high concern, particularly in northwestern North America, as it can completely replace native vegetation (Clinton et al.,  2010; Mack,  1981; Upadhyaya et al.,  1986).
2: Additionally,  B. tectorum is an agricultural and rangeland pest (Morrow & Stahlman,  1983) and increases wildfire risks, as dry  B. tectorum is highly flammable (Clinton et al.,  2010; Mack,  1981; Upadhyaya et al.,  1986).
3: Bromus tectorum's phenology is timed to precipitation events (Mack,  1984; Perkins & Hatfield,  2014), and while the species generally germinates in the fall or winter, its germination may be staggered from August to May and may occur in a series of pulses within a few days after a precipitation event (Carpenter & Murray,  2005; Kaczmarski,  2000; Mack,  1984).
4: This ability to germinate early and at various times during the growing season as well as  B. tectorum's ability to reach maturity earlier than native species could allow its dominance within communities (Clinton et al.,  2010; Kaczmarski,  2000; Monsen,  1992; Zouhar,  2003).
5: Bromus tectorum can have a high competitive advantage over native species, which is likely a result of its growth early in the spring and rapid growth response to seasonal water availability (Perkins & Hatfield,  2014), but it is unclear how these priority effects will affect community dynamics.
