0: Priority effects and other community assembly theories provide conceptual foundations for understanding why particular species form a community in a particular location (Chase,  2003; Keddy,  1992) and have been historically explored through models, such as LotkaVolterra competition models (Ke & Letten,  2018; Lewontin,  1969; May,  1971).
1: Field and greenhouse studies examining priority effects have been implemented to a much lesser extent (Fukami et al.,  2016; Hess et al.,  2019), although more studies are being conducted (i.e.
2: EJRNS et al.,  2006; Grman & Suding,  2010; Sarneel et al.,  2016; Vaughn & Young,  2015).
3: These empirical studies have reported that providing even a short time advance for native species to grow, as little as one or a few weeks, can decrease plant invasion and increase native species success (Firn et al.,  2010; Grman & Suding,  2010; Vaughn & Young,  2015).
