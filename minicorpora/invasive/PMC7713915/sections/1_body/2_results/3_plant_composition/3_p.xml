<p>Although planting order affected richness statistically (
 <italic>F</italic> = 1.67
 <sub>23, 110</sub>; 
 <italic>p</italic> = .04), further analysis did not reveal differences between treatments (Tukey's HSD, alpha = 0.1). Planting order altered both dominance and evenness (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>23, 110</sub> = 52.69 &amp; 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>23,115</sub> = 32.77, respectively; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001). We found that dominance was generally higher when BT was planted first or second and was reduced when BT was planted later (Tukey HSD, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36908-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Conversely, evenness was lowest when BT was the founder species and increased when BT arrived later (Tukey HSD, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36908-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). Both evenness and dominance were found to be linearly related to shoot biomass and planting order (
