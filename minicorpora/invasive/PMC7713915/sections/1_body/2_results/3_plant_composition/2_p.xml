<p>We explored how order of arrival affected plant composition in terms of the proportion that each species contributed to aboveground biomass in each interspecific competition treatment, exploring richness, dominance, and evenness. We expected that the proportion of BT would be highest the earlier it was planted and that this would lead to reductions in richness and evenness and increases in dominance. The proportion that a species contributed to total biomass was affected by the interaction between the planting order and species (

PS contributed the largest proportion or similar to biomass as BT when BT was planted third or fourth in the following treatments: PS → FC → BT → PA; PS → PA → BT → FC; PS → PA → FC → BT; BT → PS → PA → FC &amp; PS → FC → PA → BT. BT contributed a lower proportion to shoot biomass in some treatments when FC or PA was the founder species and BT was the last species planted: PA → PS → FC → BT; FC → PS → PA → BT; PA → FC → PS → BT; &amp; FC → PA → PS → BT (
