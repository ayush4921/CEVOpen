0: The experiment was completed at the Research Greenhouse at Thompson Rivers University in Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada.
1: Greenhouse conditions were controlled electronically (Argus control system) to maintain daytime conditions at 22C and 60% relative humidity and nighttime conditions at 15C and 85% relative humidity.
2: A 14:10 hr day:night cycle was established using supplemental lighting supplied by three 1,000 W halogen overhead lamps.
3: Seeds of each species were geminated in Petri dishes on a damp layer of sand and were transplanted into pots at four planting intervals (every 2 weeks).
4: Each species had a radicle length of at least 15 mm and a single leaf before seedlings were transferred into 4inch plastic pots lined with landscape fabric to prevent sand from leaking; each pot was filled with approximately 1 L of clean builder's sand (King Play Sand).
5: Pots were regularly bottomwatered with rain water to maintain 5 mm of water at the base and received 100 ml of Rorison's solution every seven days (Hendry et al.,  1993).
