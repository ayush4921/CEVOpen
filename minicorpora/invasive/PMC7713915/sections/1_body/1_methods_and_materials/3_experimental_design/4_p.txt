0: By the end of 6 weeks, the time of the fourth planting interval each pot contained four individuals of each species and only the order of arrival varied among the pots; intraspecific competition control pots had four individuals of the same species, and no competition control pots had only one individual.
1: After 10 weeks, shoots from all individuals were separated from the roots and cleaned of sand.
2: Shoots, hereby, aboveground biomass, were oven dried at 65C for 48 hr and weighed to 5 decimal places to assess the effects of arrival order on productivity, evenness, and dominance.
3: Richness (S) was considered the number of species in the pots after 10 weeks.
4: To better understand the relative abundance of each species, evenness was calculated using Pielou's evenness (J), where J = H/log(S) (Oksanen et al.,  2016).
5: H is the ShannonWeaver diversity index and was calculated using the equation, p iln(p i), where p i is the proportion of species.
6: We also calculated the relative intensity index (RII) for each species at each time interval to better understand how plant interactions influenced productivity (Armas et al.,  2004).
7: RII represents the competitive effect of intra and interspecific interactions compared with when the species is grown alone and is calculated using the formula: RII = (B w  B 0)/(B w + B 0), where B w is the biomass of a species growing with either type of competition and B 0 is the biomass of a species that is grown without competition.
8: A negative effect indicates the species had a competitive effect and a positive effect indicates the species had a facilitative effect on the other individuals or species (Armas et al.,  2004).
