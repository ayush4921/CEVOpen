0: Seedlings of each species were introduced to a pot at an interval of one species per planting interval without repeating a species until four individuals were in the pot, resulting in 24 possible combinations of arrival orders.
1: Four individuals of the same species were also planted at the same planting intervals to serve as a control, that is, intraspecific competition control.
2: An additional control was also included where an individual plant of each species was planted alone at each of the four planting intervals, that is, no competition control.
3: All treatments were replicated six times into blocks.
4: Seedlings were checked 3 days after transplant, and mortalities were replaced with individuals, which had been planted individually in a separate pot at the time of each planting.
5: Seedlings that died after 3 days were counted as mortalities.
