0: Four species were used in the experiment:  Bromus tectorum,  Festuca campestris,  Poa secunda, and  Pseudoroegeneria spicata.
1: All seeds were collected in Lac du Bois Protected Grasslands Area in British Columbia, Canada under Park Use Permit #102724.
2: The three native species were selected, because these are common species within the bunch grass biogeoclimatic zone within the Lac du Bois grassland, where  B. tectorum is invasive (BC Parks 2015; Fritch, Sargent, Mackenzie, Delesalle, & Delesalle  2009).
3: These species are important for maintaining native diversity in these grasslands and are important forage for wildlife and cattle (Church et al.,  2015).
4: Bromus tectorum is an exotic, annual species that was introduced into North America from Europe in the 18th century and has spread throughout most of the continent (Upadhyaya et al.,  1986; Valliant et al.,  2007).
5: Multiple genotypes of  B. tectorum indicate unique introduction events of this species through multiple entry ports in eastern and western Canada (Valliant et al.,  2007).
6: Although genetic variation of the species is relatively low, phenotypic plasticity is high in  B. tectorum, making the species adaptable to many environmental conditions (Valliant et al.,  2007).
7: Bromus tectorum is considered a noxious weed, particularly in rangelands, where it tends to germinate earlier than native species and can extract moisture from shallow soil layers inhibiting the establishment of desirable perennial native species (Upadhyaya et al.,  1986), such as those in this study:  F. campestris,  P. secunda, and  P. spicata.
