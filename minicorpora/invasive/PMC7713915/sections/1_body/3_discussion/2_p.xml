<p>This experiment demonstrates that priority effects can impact both productivity and composition of grasses within a mesocosm setting, and the species that demonstrated the largest impacts on productivity and community structure was 
 <italic>Bromus tectorum</italic>, an aggressive, invasive species in North American grasslands. Simply by altering arrival of only four plant species that commonly co‐occur in western North American, semiarid grasslands, we found that the aboveground productivity of plant communities grown with 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> can vary by a factor of 3.25 over a 10‐week growth period. Considering the important relationships between productivity and other ecosystem properties such as biodiversity (Loreau et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36908-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>), it is clear that assembly sequence should be an important consideration in our understanding of plant communities and ecosystem processes, especially in annual communities and early successional stages. Further, this will be particularly important to consider when restoring sites that have been invaded with 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic>, which may experience 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> germination in a series of pulses following rainfall events from August through May (Carpenter &amp; Murray,
