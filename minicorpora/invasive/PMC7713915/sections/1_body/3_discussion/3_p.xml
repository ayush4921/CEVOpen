<p>Specifically, we found that earlier arrival of 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> increased total aboveground productivity when grown with native grass species. We suspect that this effect was the result of 
 <italic>B. tectorums</italic>' rapid growth compared with the native perennial grasses, and this species' ability to alter its phenotypic expression depending on environmental conditions (Valliant et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36908-bib-0056" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). In this case, conditions were highly suitable for plant growth, and it would be interesting to explore whether or not the same effects would be found when 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> is grown under drier and nutrient poor conditions. Our experiment further revealed that the competitive effect (RII) of 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> was reduced when grown with native grasses, suggesting that the native plants could have an advantage if 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> arrives to the community later and is not already a monoculture at the site being restored.
