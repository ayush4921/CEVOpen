<p>Our experiment investigated colonization and early establishment phases of plant community development, as the study was terminated after 10 weeks. And, although 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> dominated biomass as the founder species as well as the second order arrival it is not known whether 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> dominance would persist for more than one generation; 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> was the only annual species in this study but is a prolific seed generator. However, given that 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> has been shown to alter soil properties, such as nitrogen dynamics (e.g., Evans et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36908-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>) and increase prevalence of wildfire (e.g., Knapp, 
 <xref rid="ece36908-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">1996</xref>), our study provides important information on conditions that favor dominance, namely when 
 <italic>B. tectorum</italic> was planted early in succession and was able to take advantage of earlier and faster growth. Seedling emergence and germination are crucial events in the life cycle of plants, as the time at which germination or emergence occurs often determines subsequent performance and success particularly under competitive situations (Harper, 
 <xref rid="ece36908-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">1977</xref>; Verdu &amp; Traveset, 
 <xref rid="ece36908-bib-0059" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>). Here, we also found that even short delays in seedling emergence time can impact the fitness of perennial native grass species when grown in the presence of an aggressive annual species.
