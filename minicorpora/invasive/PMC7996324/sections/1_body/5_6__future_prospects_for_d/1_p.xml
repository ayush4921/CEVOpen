<p>Changes to spatial and temporal gradients in temperature and water availability as a result of urbanization may lead to overall shifts in dragonfly behavior, including migration, mating, and thermoregulatory activities [
 <xref rid="B107-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. While habitat destruction and/or alteration may accelerate local extinction rates for some habitat-specific dragonflies, some species may benefit greatly from artificial freshwater habitats and urban heat island effects [
 <xref rid="B108-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Some dragonflies may be more tolerant of urban impacts and possess physiological, phenological and morphological traits, which allow them to occupy urban environments [

 <xref rid="B111-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. More information on which dragonfly species benefit from freshwater habitats in urban settings, and which species suffer as a result of urbanization is required, so their conservation needs can be determined to prevent local and regional extinctions [
