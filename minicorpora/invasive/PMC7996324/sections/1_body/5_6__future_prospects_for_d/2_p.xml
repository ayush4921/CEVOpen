<p>Dragonflies are apex predators in the freshwater insect realm, and offer important ecological services such as biological pest control, particularly where disease vectors such as mosquitoes are abundant [

 <xref rid="B112-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. Dragonflies may also cause disservices by feeding on important pollinators in urban and suburban settings [

 <xref rid="B115-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. As a result, they have a significant influence on freshwater trophic interactions and energy flows between terrestrial and aquatic environments [
