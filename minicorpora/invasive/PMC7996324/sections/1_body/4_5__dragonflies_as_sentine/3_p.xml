<p>Many lessons can be learned from the successful citizen science projects in southern Africa, where the public has access to an assortment of dragonfly-related literature and identification tools [

 <xref rid="B104-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. Collectively, the two dragonfly recording initiatives in Africa, the Odonata Database of Africa [
 <xref rid="B105-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>] and OdonataMap [
 <xref rid="B106-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>] host well over 200,000 dragonfly records, with almost 50% being in South Africa. Most records are from Gauteng, Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal, which are the provinces with the highest level of urbanization in the country (Gauteng and the Western Cape), or has the highest current urbanization rate (KwaZulu-Natal). This means that there is great potential for the use of data acquired through dragonfly citizen science to investigate responses to on-going urbanization [
