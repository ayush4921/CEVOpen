<p>Dragonflies have large body sizes and striking male coloration (

Dragonfly citizen science also creates unique opportunities to rapidly generate large dragonfly distribution and abundance datasets through collaborations between scientists and the broader public. Although citizen science project may be difficult in rural areas with small, dispersed human populations, they can be effective in urban areas. The comparatively rapid nature of citizen science data collection against professional scientific data collection is also useful from a temporal perspective, where regular data collection across wide urban areas enables ecologists to model dragonfly responses to ongoing urbanization and/or restoration.
