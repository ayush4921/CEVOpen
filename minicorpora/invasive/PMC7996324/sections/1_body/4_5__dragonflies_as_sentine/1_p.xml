<p>The relationships between dragonfly occupancy, ecological integrity and urbanization are still poorly understood in Africa. One of the greatest challenges is that historical data for dragonfly occupancy before the onset of urbanization do not exist or are very limited. This further restricts thorough understanding of how dragonfly assemblages and population sizes have changed over time in response to urbanization. However, dragonflies are valuable as sentinels for an array of environmental disturbances, including climate change and habitat degradation [

They can also help identify management and restoration needs of freshwater habitats in urban areas. Furthermore, dragonflies are effective conservation umbrellas, meaning that dragonfly conservation also benefits other co-occurring freshwater taxa [
