<p>In addition to ecosystem-based adaptation in the Durban Metropolitan Area (DMA) having high social and economic value, the conservation and management of natural patches and corridors also have high biodiversity value. Since dragonflies rely on terrestrial and aquatic environments to complete their life cycles, protecting a range of aquatic habitats, as well as natural riparian zones, greatly contributes to dragonfly conservation. Conversion of agricultural areas, such as abandoned sugarcane fields, has also contributed to dragonfly conservation, with former irrigation reserves contributing greatly to local dragonfly diversity (
