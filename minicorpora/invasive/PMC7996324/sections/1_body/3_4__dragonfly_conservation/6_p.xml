<p>With the city center falling within the Table Mountain National Park, it has received high levels of conservation action (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00190-f003">Figure 3</xref>c), partly through the extreme topography limiting urban development [
 <xref rid="B87-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Conserving the natural habitats of Table Mountain is important, as it hosts some of the rarest and most ancient endemic dragonfly species, dating back to 59 my [

 <italic>Orthetrum rubens</italic>. However, this endemic species occupies other mountainous areas nearby, so has not gone extinct [
 <xref rid="B45-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Yet, lowland freshwater habitats around the mountain are particularly vulnerable, and several streams and wetlands have been lost since the onset of urbanization [
 <xref rid="B89-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. The freshwater habitats that remain are under severe pressure through physical modification and high nutrient and pollutant inputs [
 <xref rid="B90-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Deteriorated environmental conditions is problematic for dragonflies, and only a handful of species are capable of occupying highly impacted freshwater habitats. Some of the largest remaining wetlands within protected lowland areas have deteriorated greatly, and these low quality urban freshwater habitats have little value for the endemic dragonflies in the CFR (
