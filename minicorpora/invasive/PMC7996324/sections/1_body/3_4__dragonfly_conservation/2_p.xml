<p>The first implementation of ecosystem-based adaptation in South Africa was in the coastal city of Durban, where the Durban Metropolitan Open Space System (Dâ€™MOSS) action plan was designed. 80,000 ha was set aside to protect the Maputaland-Pondoland-Albany global biodiversity hotspot and to maintain ecosystem service delivery [

 <xref rid="B81-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. For example, the action plan includes the protection of natural inland wetlands that limit the needs for additional stormwater ponds in urban areas, conservation of intact mangroves that reduce coastal flooding and erosion, and alien vegetation removal that restores hydrological function. Similarly, near-natural riverbanks are included to prevent flash floods, while agro-ecological approaches encourage natural pollinators and pest control. Therefore, protection of these habitats leads to ecosystem service delivery without requiring additional expensive infrastructural development.
