<p>Inland cities in heavily urbanized regions such as the Tshwane Metropolitan Area in the Gauteng Province of South Africa, an area moderately rich in dragonfly species (just over 40 species), have many artificial ponds and lakes for water storage used in mining and agricultural activities (

 <xref rid="B91-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Tailing ponds were specifically established to store byproducts of mining activities, and when mining was stopped during the 1970s, little environmental legislation was in place to enforce rehabilitation of tailing ponds [

 <xref rid="B92-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>], an important step towards encouraging dragonflies and other aquatic insects. Artificial wetland construction has also been effective in passively assimilating heavy metals in freshwater ecosystems, while simultaneously raising aesthetic appeal of heavily impacted watercourses [

During the development of Tshwane’s suburbs in the mid-1950s, some streams and rivers which flow through urban areas were recognized in efforts to preserve green and blue spaces, while acknowledging that ‘wild’ areas have higher value to citizens compared to intensively managed parks and greenways (

 <xref rid="B96-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. However, rehabilitated and/or preserved green and blue spaces have the potential to improve functional connectivity among existing nature reserves and other open spaces, and have the potential to attract high levels of biodiversity [
 <xref rid="B97-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. Indeed, several dragonflies, including some South African endemic species such as 
 <italic>Africallagma sapphirinum</italic> and 
 <italic>Proischnura rotundipennis</italic>, benefit greatly from artificial ponds in heavily urbanized environments [
