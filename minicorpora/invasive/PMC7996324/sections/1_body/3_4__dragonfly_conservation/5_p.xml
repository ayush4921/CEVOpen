<p>Biodiversity patterns are complex in Cape Town, a coastal city built around Table Mountain in the heart of the Cape Floristic Region (CFR) [
 <xref rid="B85-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. This city deviates from the standard model of urban biodiversity, where diversity decreases towards city centers [

 <xref rid="B87-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Although total dragonfly species richness is not as high as the subtropical regions of southern Africa (close to 50 species), this Mediterranean area is characterized by about 17 national endemic dragonfly species [

 <italic>Chlorolestes conspicuus</italic>, 
 <italic>Allocnemis leucosticta</italic>, 
 <italic>Elattoneura frenulata</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudagrion draconis</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudagrion furcigerum</italic>, 
 <italic>Syncordulia venator</italic>, and 
 <italic>Orthetrum julia capicola</italic>. The disproportionally high number of endemic dragonfly species is the result of this region having had a moderate climate for many millions of years, strong orographic patterns, and many streams, rivers, wetlands and ponds, leading to high levels of environmental heterogeneity.
