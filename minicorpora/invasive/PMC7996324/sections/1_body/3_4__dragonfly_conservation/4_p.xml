<p>Elsewhere in the Maputaland-Pondoland-Albany biodiversity hotspot, freshwater bodies in botanical gardens play a major role in local protection of dragonflies (

The purpose of this artificial pond was to promote aquatic plant conservation, while simultaneously forming an integral part of a dragonfly trail to raise awareness on the ecological importance of dragonflies and their conservation [

Interventions included removal of invasive alien vegetation, clearing dense vegetation to halt vegetation succession, and occasional dredging to manage siltation. The public also responded well to the dragonfly trail, which stimulated production of a dedicated and comprehensive identification guide for the PMG [
