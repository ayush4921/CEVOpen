<p>The inevitability of increasing urbanization has far reaching consequences for dragonflies through direct and indirect impacts, especially in combination with global climate change. Some aspects of dragonflies in African urban environments are still under-investigated, but by drawing from other continents, which have been confronted with urbanization much earlier, we can act rapidly and effectively to protect these iconic freshwater insects from future population extinctions across Africa. Certain dragonflies are well-equipped to deal with some of the physical and chemical changes brought about by urbanization. Urban landscapes may also create unique opportunities for dragonflies, and urban waterbodies with other primary functions may secondarily increase area of occupancy for some dragonflies. Yet, freshwater habitats in urban areas are only effective reserves for a variety of dragonflies and other aquatic insects when they resemble natural freshwater habitats as closely as possible. This is often only achievable by practicing appropriate management around freshwater habitats (e.g., removing woody invasive alien plants, maintaining water flow, and mitigating pollution) in close association with urban areas. Community outreach and raising public awareness can further assist in securing high-quality habitats for dragonflies, especially in developing countries where the need for freshwater resources are increasing dramatically.</p>
