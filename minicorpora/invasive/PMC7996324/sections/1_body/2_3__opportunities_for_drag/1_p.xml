<p>As much as 80% of land may be covered by hard surfaces in city centers [
 <xref rid="B65-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], and a rising skyline strongly limits the movement of individuals. Urban green spaces, such as parks, gardens, cemeteries and nature reserves, are fragmented habitat patches in an otherwise inhospitable matrix. These urban green spaces are no substitute for wild areas, but they play an important role as refuges and supplementary habitats, both for widespread species and those of high conservation concern (

 <xref rid="B5-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Although urban green spaces are potential sites for alien vegetation colonization, this can be circumvented by establishing native vegetation that improves functional connectivity for insect populations [

 <xref rid="B66-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] and size, quality and connectivity of urban green spaces are essential for maintaining dragonfly assemblages. Most zygopterans require only 50–300 m of favorable environment around their central habitats [
 <xref rid="B67-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], while certain anisoperans, such as 
 <italic>Sympetrum depressiusculum</italic>, require foraging areas of about 0.5–1 km around their natal habitats [
 <xref rid="B68-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. In turn, highly mobile and migratory species such as 
 <italic>Pantala flavescens</italic> may fly over oceans in search of breeding habitats.
