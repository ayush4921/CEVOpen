<p>Urban ponds may be built for aesthetic enhancement, water storage, managing urban hydrology, and/or for biodiversity conservation. Although insect conservation is rarely the primary aim of pond construction, some artificial water bodies have high secondary value as tiny reserves for aquatic insects in urban environments (

For some central European cities, ponds can increase the area of occupancy for nearly 93% of all dragonflies present in the region, especially Mediterranean species. Acknowledging that some with specialized habitat requirements are excluded from urban environments, some dragonfly species colonizing urban ponds may be of high conservation value [

Similarly, ponds established for municipal use or conservation of game animals (e.g., water holes) in arid regions of South Africa may attract some generalist dragonflies and extend their areas of occupancy into formerly unoccupied regions [
