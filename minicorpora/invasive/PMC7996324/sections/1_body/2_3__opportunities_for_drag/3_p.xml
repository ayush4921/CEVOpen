<p>In turn, urban rivers and streams with wide (&gt;30 m) riparian zones, but free of woody alien vegetation, provide sunny microhabitat and promote habitat heterogeneity (

Dragonfly assemblages recover remarkably well when alien vegetation is cleared, and some endemic species recover their area of occupancy and part of their former distribution ranges [
