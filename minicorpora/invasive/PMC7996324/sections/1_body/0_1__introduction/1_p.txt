3: While large cities are becoming more prevalent, classification boundaries between types of settlements are often unclear [ 4].
4: Yet, urban settlements are generally hardscapes overlying greenscapes [ 5].
5: Gradients of urbanization have complex consequences for the global natural environment [ 6, 7].
6: These impacts broadly include habitat loss, pollution, alien vegetation encroachment, and changes in microclimates, and their effects often extend far beyond settlement centers [ 8, 9, 10].
