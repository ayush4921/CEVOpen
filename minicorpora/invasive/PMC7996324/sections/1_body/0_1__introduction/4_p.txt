0: Within sub-Saharan Africa, southern Africa is the most urbanized region due to its accessible coastline, abundant mineral deposits and rich soils [ 19].
1: In southern African cities, urbanization primarily increases as a result of rural-urban migration.
2: In contrast, local human population growth is the leading driver of urbanization in rural areas, albeit slower compared to major cities.
3: Yet, scientists have been slow to investigate the ecological impact of urbanization on the rich African insect fauna.
4: Most aquatic insect groups are poorly studied across the continent [ 20].
5: Southern African dragonflies (referring to both dragonflies and damselflies; Odonata: Anisoptera and Zygoptera) are by far the most studied group of insects in terms of their taxonomy and biogeography [ 21].
