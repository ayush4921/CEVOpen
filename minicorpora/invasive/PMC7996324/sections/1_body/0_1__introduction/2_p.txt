0: Urban landscapes are not usually designed for biodiversity conservation [ 11].
1: A manifestation of this is that insect species richness generally declines towards city centers [ 12, 13].
2: However, urban greening can be highly beneficial for insect biodiversity [ 14].
3: This involves including green spaces, such as botanical gardens, public parks and cemeteries in urban design, along with clearing alien vegetation and encouraging native vegetation [ 5].
4: These green spaces allow insects from a range of functional groups to persist in areas dominated by urbanization, while simultaneously promoting human well-being and bringing urbanites closer to nature.
