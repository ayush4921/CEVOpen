0: Here, we review the interface between dragonflies and urban/suburban areas across southern Africa.
1: We provide insight into the direct and indirect impacts of urbanization on dragonflies in the global context, and highlight how certain urban areas provide particular opportunities for dragonfly occupancy and conservation.
2: Using three densely-populated regions in water-scarce South Africa as case studies, we also synthesize urban impacts and opportunities for dragonflies.
3: Finally, we evaluate citizen science as a data collection method for investigating and monitoring urban dragonfly ecology, and make recommendations for future research.
