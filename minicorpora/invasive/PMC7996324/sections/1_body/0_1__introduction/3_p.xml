<p>Africa is the fastest urbanizing continent [
 <xref rid="B15-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], with settlements being established close to waterbodies in response to severe water scarcity, especially across sub-Saharan Africa where El Ni√±o events lead to unstable water supplies [
 <xref rid="B16-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Due to the space limitations in existing urban areas, the fastest urban growth is in small towns with high poverty levels. Ecological impacts are expected to be particularly severe in ecologically sensitive areas [

 <xref rid="B18-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], further exacerbated by ineffective environmental regulations due to limited scientific knowledge on biological responses to urbanization [
 <xref rid="B15-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Africa presents a range of abiotic and biotic challenges to biodiversity, and with much of the continent still undeveloped, urbanization is considered one of the greatest looming threats.
