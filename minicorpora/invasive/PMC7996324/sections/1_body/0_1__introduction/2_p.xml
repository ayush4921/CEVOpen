<p>Urban landscapes are not usually designed for biodiversity conservation [

 <xref rid="B13-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, urban greening can be highly beneficial for insect biodiversity [
 <xref rid="B14-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This involves including green spaces, such as botanical gardens, public parks and cemeteries in urban design, along with clearing alien vegetation and encouraging native vegetation [
 <xref rid="B5-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These green spaces allow insects from a range of functional groups to persist in areas dominated by urbanization, while simultaneously promoting human well-being and bringing urbanites closer to nature.
