<p>Here, we review the interface between dragonflies and urban/suburban areas across southern Africa. We provide insight into the direct and indirect impacts of urbanization on dragonflies in the global context, and highlight how certain urban areas provide particular opportunities for dragonfly occupancy and conservation. Using three densely-populated regions in water-scarce South Africa as case studies, we also synthesize urban impacts and opportunities for dragonflies. Finally, we evaluate citizen science as a data collection method for investigating and monitoring urban dragonfly ecology, and make recommendations for future research.</p>
