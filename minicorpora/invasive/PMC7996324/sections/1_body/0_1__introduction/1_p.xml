<p>Human settlements have increased in global proportion, especially during the last century [
 <xref rid="B1-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Urban settlements range from villages with fuzzy boundaries in rural areas to large cities with dense human populations. Over time, villages growing into towns and towns growing into cities result in rapid infrastructural densification [

 <xref rid="B3-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. While large cities are becoming more prevalent, classification boundaries between types of settlements are often unclear [
 <xref rid="B4-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Yet, urban settlements are generally hardscapes overlying greenscapes [

 <xref rid="B7-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These impacts broadly include habitat loss, pollution, alien vegetation encroachment, and changes in microclimates, and their effects often extend far beyond settlement centers [
