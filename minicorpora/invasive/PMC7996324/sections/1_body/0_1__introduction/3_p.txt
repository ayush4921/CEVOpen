0: Africa is the fastest urbanizing continent [ 15], with settlements being established close to waterbodies in response to severe water scarcity, especially across sub-Saharan Africa where El Nino events lead to unstable water supplies [ 16].
1: Due to the space limitations in existing urban areas, the fastest urban growth is in small towns with high poverty levels.
2: Ecological impacts are expected to be particularly severe in ecologically sensitive areas [ 17, 18], further exacerbated by ineffective environmental regulations due to limited scientific knowledge on biological responses to urbanization [ 15].
3: Africa presents a range of abiotic and biotic challenges to biodiversity, and with much of the continent still undeveloped, urbanization is considered one of the greatest looming threats.
