 <xref rid="B56-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. While highly polluted urban waterbodies function as ecological traps for dragonflies, some adult dragonflies are able to assess physicochemical properties of aquatic habitats and may avoid breeding in them [
 <xref rid="B57-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Sensitive species may be killed by pollutants and, with less competition, tolerant species may dominate [

 <italic>Ischnura senegalensis</italic>, are adapted to breed in ponds and slow-moving water channels engineered by hippos, and where defecation takes place. These damselflies are therefore predisposed to occupy organically polluted urban water bodies.
