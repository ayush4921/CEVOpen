<p>Potential urban impacts on dragonflies and other aquatic macroinvertebrates vary with context. For instance, a comparison of urban and rural ponds in the United Kingdom showed that macroinvertebrate assemblage composition varied among pond types, and urban ponds made an equal contribution to regional diversity as rural ponds [

Conversely, a long-term comparison between urban stormwater ponds and natural ponds in Canada showed that anisopteran species richness and abundance, and zygopteran abundance, were lower for stormwater ponds, suggesting that urban ponds have little added value in this particular regional context [

In South Africa, a comparison between agricultural and urban rivers showed that agricultural and urban land use changes have similar effects on total dragonfly species richness, endemic dragonfly species richness, and zygopteran species richness alone, but not anisopteran species richness [
