<p>In arid and semi-arid countries, construction of dams alleviates water scarcity for the benefit of agricultural, industrial and domestic sectors [
 <xref rid="B21-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Damming does not destroy aquatic habitats so much as converts lotic (flowing) into lentic (standing) habitats, with a concurrent shift in dragonfly composition from a characteristically lotic assemblage to a lentic one, as shown for the subtropical region of South Africa [
 <xref rid="B49-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Combined with alien vegetation, damming of rivers can lead to great reductions in macroinvertebrate diversity (

 <xref rid="B50-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. River impoundment for water security leads to a local loss of almost half of the native riverine dragonfly species, although this recovers farther downstream [
 <xref rid="B51-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Damming of rivers also introduces other disturbances, such as alien fish (e.g., 
 <italic>Oncorhynchus mykiss</italic> and 
 <italic>Micropterus salmoides</italic>) for recreational fishing. These generalist predators feed in different areas of the water column, leading to population declines of dragonfly larvae and adults. Other damming disturbances include increased wave action from boating, which can have a great impact on marginal vegetation integrity, and uncontrolled civilian access, leading to bank disturbance and increased pollution levels [
