<p>On the other hand, when marginal vegetation is too dense, there is a decline in dragonfly diversity (

 <xref rid="B42-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. When dense stands of invasive alien shrubs and trees, especially 
 <italic>Acacia</italic> trees, replace native riparian vegetation in urban areas, dragonfly habitats are adversely transformed mainly through loss of sunny local environments [

 <xref rid="B44-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. About a quarter of all South African dragonflies are endemic to the country, with twelve red-listed as threatened [
 <xref rid="B45-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. These dragonflies are almost exclusively threatened by alien vegetation in their habitats. In addition to shading, alien vegetation contributes to soil erosion through homogenization of riparian plant communities, and leads to increased runoff into rivers and higher sediment loads [
 <xref rid="B46-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Invasive water hyacinth (
 <italic>Eichhornia crassipes</italic>) is another cause of concern across Africa, forming dense mats of floating vegetation on ponds and lakes in urban areas and some protected sites [
 <xref rid="B47-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Riparian and floating invasive plants eliminate native species and reduce overall habitat heterogeneity (e.g., through a reduction in oxygen supplies and increases in water temperature), which in turn leads to local changes from specialist dragonfly assemblages to assemblages dominated by generalists [
