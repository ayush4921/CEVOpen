<p>Indirect urban impacts on aquatic insects are complex, and their collective magnitude may outweigh the magnitude of direct impacts [
 <xref rid="B24-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Many adult aquatic insects, including dragonflies, rely on terrestrial environments. Urban modification of their terrestrial surroundings is as important as modifications to their freshwater habitats, and has far-reaching effects on their fitness (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00190-f001">Figure 1</xref>). For example, many dragonfly species require submerged or overhanging marginal vegetation for oviposition. Emergent adults (tenerals) also move away from water to vegetation, only returning to aquatic habitats when mature [
 <xref rid="B38-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The loss of terrestrial vegetation, thus, reduces functional connectivity, limits local dragonfly movement and inhibits natural dragonfly population dynamics. Indeed, vegetation cover is often a better predictor of dragonfly occupancy than in-water conditions, and vegetation conservation and restoration can even buffer the effects of urbanization [

 <xref rid="B40-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Dragonflies in general respond more to vegetation cover and complexity than to plant species identity. Yet, some do not rely on vegetation to complete their life cycles, meaning that preservation of vegetation integrity alone does not guarantee dragonfly occupancy.
