<p>Other less obvious impacts of urbanization, such as excessive artificial lighting, may also have an indirect impact on dragonflies (

 <xref rid="B60-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], especially in the case of certain crepuscular species such as those in the genus 
 <italic>Gynacantha</italic>. Artificial lighting may interfere with dragonfly dispersal, and also function as ecological traps through increasing encounter rates with insectivorous predators [
