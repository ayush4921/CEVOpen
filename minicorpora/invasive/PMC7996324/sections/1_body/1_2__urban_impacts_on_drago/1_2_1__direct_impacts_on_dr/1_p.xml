<p>Urbanization places immense direct pressure on freshwater habitats (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00190-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Infilling and draining for infrastructure development are a major cause of freshwater habitat destruction [

 <xref rid="B23-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], with losses in freshwater habitats strongly correlated with losses of green space in some countries [
 <xref rid="B24-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. About 50% of global ponds and wetlands have been lost during the last century, partly due to urbanization [
 <xref rid="B25-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Furthermore, global urbanization during the last 50 years has led to sediment loads in rivers being up to 120 times higher than natural loads [
 <xref rid="B26-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. African pond and river losses have been poorly documented, yet it is estimated that as much as 97% of all wetlands have been lost around Cape Town, South Africa, as a direct result of infrastructural development [
 <xref rid="B27-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. These numbers reflect the potential wide impacts of accelerating urbanization across Africa.
