<p>Translating habitat losses to biodiversity losses is challenging, since information on the historical states of freshwater habitats across Africa is lacking. Nearly 6% of all described insect species occupy freshwater habitats [

 <xref rid="B29-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. These dragonflies and other aquatic insects are under immense pressure from accelerating rates of urbanization at the expense of natural waterbodies, ultimately leading to decreasing population sizes and local extinctions [
 <xref rid="B30-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Habitat loss is particularly problematic for rare species that occupy natural ponds. Although these ponds are often regarded an ecologically unimportant, they are in fact highly complementary at the regional scale [
