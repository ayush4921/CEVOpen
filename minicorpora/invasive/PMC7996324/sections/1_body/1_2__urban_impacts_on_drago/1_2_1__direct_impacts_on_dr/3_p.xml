<p>High road density is almost synonymous with urbanization, and roads affect dragonflies in several ways (

 <xref rid="B24-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Roads can limit movement between favorable habitats and act as dragonfly movement barriers [
 <xref rid="B32-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], resulting in progressive isolation of populations and loss of genetic diversity over time. Roads and other glossy surfaces may also attract some flying insects, especially adult dragonflies, functioning as ecological traps so placing additional pressure on breeding populations, especially for localized species [
 <xref rid="B33-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Although no information is available for Africa, &gt;60% of all insects killed by moving vehicles in India are dragonflies [
 <xref rid="B34-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], while in Japan the figure is only 17% [
 <xref rid="B35-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. These differing figures suggest that various factors are involved, ranging from vehicle density and speed, to the type of roadside environment, to the distance from a waterbody [
 <xref rid="B24-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Even dragonfly flight behavior has an effect, with species that fly close to the ground being impacted the most [
 <xref rid="B36-insects-12-00190" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. These findings indicate that road construction close to dragonfly habitats should be avoided, especially important sites for endemic species [
