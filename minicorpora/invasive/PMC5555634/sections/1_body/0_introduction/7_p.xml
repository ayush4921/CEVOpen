<p>In its native range, it grows in wet places such as damp meadows, streamsides, flushes and bushy slopes between 1600 m and 2800 m a.s.l. [

Additionally, the species occurs at the edges of scrubs and on escarpments of stream banks, as well as near buildings, roads, and railway tracks [
 <xref rid="pone.0182793.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Due to latitudinal differences, it is also found in much lower altitudes ranging from about 480 m to 690 m a.s.l.
