<p>A species that also produces very big amount of seeds and in Poland is already classified as an invasive plant is 
 <italic>Selinum alatum</italic> (M. Bieb.) Poir. (= 
 <italic>Cnidiocarpa alata</italic> (M. Bieb.) Pimenov &amp; Kljuiykov) (Apiaceae, Selineae). It is native to the Caucasus region and the Armenian Highlands, but its several populations were found recently in Poland [
 <xref rid="pone.0182793.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], about 1,100 km in a straight line from the nearest native locality [
 <xref rid="pone.0182793.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Moreover, it seems that the species is naturalised, and colonises new areas and extends its range predominantly within the Bieszczady Mts in the Eastern Carpathians [
