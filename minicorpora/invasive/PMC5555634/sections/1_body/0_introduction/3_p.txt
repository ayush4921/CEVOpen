0: Probably two of the most economically and ecologically problematic invasive plants in Central Europe are  Reynoutria japonica Houtt.
1: (Polygonaceae) and  Solidago sp.
2: (Asteraceae).
3: Reynoutria japonica is well known for its high strength of shoot growth sprouting from rhizomes in the spring.
4: Rhizomes can grow up to 2 m in depth, and shoots outgrow areas paved with cobbles and even covered with asphalt.
5: Due to difficult and costly procedures in removing the rhizomes, e.g., in the UK a land for sale on which the knotweed occurs, is much cheaper than the land without these plants [ 9].
