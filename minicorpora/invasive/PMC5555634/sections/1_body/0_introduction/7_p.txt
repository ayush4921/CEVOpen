0: In its native range, it grows in wet places such as damp meadows, streamsides, flushes and bushy slopes between 1600 m and 2800 m a.s.l.
1: [ 14].
2: In Poland, it is mostly found in patches of ruderal communities; accompanying species are then often common meadow species.
3: The favourable conditions to develop are greatly disturbed and therefore open to colonizers.
4: Moreover,  S.  alatum was recorded in semi-natural over-fertilised and disturbed fresh meadows, and single specimens were observed within slightly wetter meadows.
5: Additionally, the species occurs at the edges of scrubs and on escarpments of stream banks, as well as near buildings, roads, and railway tracks [ 12].
6: Due to latitudinal differences, it is also found in much lower altitudes ranging from about 480 m to 690 m a.s.l.
