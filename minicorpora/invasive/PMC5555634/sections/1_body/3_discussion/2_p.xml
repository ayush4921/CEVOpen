<p>The potential range of 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>alatum</italic> is largely unfilled now; however, further spreading of the species is likely to be observed. If the transport of diaspores occurs, mountainous areas in Europe will mostly be penetrated, mainly the Carpathians (where it is currently found), the Sudetes, the Alps, the Pindus Mts, and the Balkan Mts. A present suitability map notably indicates that favourable habitats are located in the upper parts of Dniester and Prut drainage basins. This may be important in the spreading of the species since rivers are known to aid greatly in dispersal of invasive species [
 <xref rid="pone.0182793.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and presently known invasive populations of 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>alatum</italic> from Bieszczady Mts occur close to the upstream area of those rivers (i.e., only 35 km to the west). To some degree, spreading may also be achieved by an accidental human transportation; for example, mountain tourism.
