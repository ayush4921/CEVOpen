<p>Nobis et al. [

 <italic>alatum</italic> to Poland, including the most probable accidental transportation that took place around the mid-20
 <sup>th</sup> century. Taking into account this relatively recent introduction, vast areas of potentially suitable habitats remain to be filled by 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>alatum</italic> and the species may become a new component of a few semi-natural or disturbed plant communities in many mountain areas within Europe. The fresh mountain meadows, especially abandoned, over-fertilised and disturbed, as well as escarpments of stream and river banks, also fallow lands, road and railway track margins, and generally the vicinity of human settlements seem to be the most suitable habitats for the species. Moreover, potential habitats are edges of scrubs and patches of slightly wetter meadows [

 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>alatum</italic> rapidly change in terms of both quantitative proportions of indigenous plant species and a species composition.
