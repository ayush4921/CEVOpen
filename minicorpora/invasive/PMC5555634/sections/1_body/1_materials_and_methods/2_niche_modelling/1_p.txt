0: Nineteen bioclimatic variables in 30 arc s (~1 km 2) from the worldclim database [ 16] were clipped using biotic regions where occurrences were found.
1: Biotic regions serve as a reliable estimator for the area that is accessible to the species and it is the most operational way to designate correct M which delimitates dispersal potential of a species [ 17],[ 18].
2: For that purpose, the map of terrestrial ecoregions of the world was used [ 19].
3: Temperate biomes were clipped at the Ural Mountains which represents a biogeographical barrier for many plant species.
4: To account for the co-linearity and to select the most important bioclimatic variables, the number of the original WorldClim variables was reduced.
5: For that purpose an R package MaxentVariableSelection [ 20] was used which utilizes similar procedure as Warren et al.
6: [ 21] with the aim to choose appropriate beta-multiplier and exclude correlated variables.
7: To achieve that a set of models is created with different settings (varying in the value of beta-multiplier and the number of variables) and their performance is assessed by calculating Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), AIC corrected for small sample sizes (AICc), and Bayesian information criterion (BIC).
8: Following criteria were applied: correlation threshold was set to 0.7, contribution threshold to 5 and beta-multiplier was tested in the range from 1 to 15 using 0.5 steps.
9: Settings with the highest AICc score were chosen for modelling.
