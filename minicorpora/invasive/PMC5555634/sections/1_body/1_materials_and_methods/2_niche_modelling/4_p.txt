0: Predictions of the future extent of climatic niche were performed using climate projections obtained from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIPP5) using four representative concentration pathways (RCPs: rcp26, rcp45, rcp60, rcp85) which differ in predicted CO 2 concentration [ 25].
1: Only models covering all four representative concentration pathways for the year 2070 (average for 20612080) were obtained from  www.worldclim.org ( S3 Table).
2: To reduce the bias caused by the selection of only one specific model, they were averaged and the ensemble map for each variable in particular RCP was computed.
3: For presentation of the results, continuous grids were converted to binary grids using maximum training sensitivity plus specificity logistic threshold.
4: In the future predictions soil and topographic data were not used due to uncertainties and lack of availability of their future estimates.
