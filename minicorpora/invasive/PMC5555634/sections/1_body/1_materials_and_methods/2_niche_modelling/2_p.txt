0: Additionally it was tested whether any other factors related to topographic or soil properties may be important for modelling distribution of the species.
1: To account for that three separate analyses were run including: selected soil variables, selected soil and climatic variables, and a joint analysis with all (43) available variables.
2: 18 soil variables relevant to plant growth were downloaded from  www.soilgrids.org [ 22] in 250 m 2 resolution and were upscaled to match bioclimatic variables.
3: Additionally, six topographic variables based on elevation raster were included.
4: Full list of variables is provided in supporting information ( S2 Table).
5: Soil and topographic variables were subject to the procedures of variable selection as previously described.
