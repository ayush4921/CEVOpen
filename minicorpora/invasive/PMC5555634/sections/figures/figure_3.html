 <caption> Response curves characterising how each variable affected the Maxent prediction. A red line shows how the logistic prediction changes as each environmental variable is varied keeping all other environmental variables at their average sample value, while a blue line illustrates a Maxent model created using only the corresponding variable. The solid line represents second quantile (median) while dashed lines represent the first and third quantiles. Boxplots show the distribution of values observed in the localities used in the current study. Circle represents mean, horizontal lines minimum and maximum, the box represents first and third quantiles, and vertical line inside delineates median. </caption>
