  <p>Antifungal activity of α-Cyperone against 
   <italic>Candida</italic> and 
   <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> species. (
   <bold>a</bold>) 
   <italic>C. krusei</italic> was grown in honeycomb microtiter wells containing RPMI 1640 medium in the presence (62.5 µg/mL &amp; 125 µg/mL) and absence of α-Cyperone for about 14 h at 37 °C. Fungus growth was measured by absorbance at optical density (OD) 600 nm using Bioscreen-C growth monitor. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Control (−) and α-Cyperone exposed (+) (MIC dose) fungal cells from microtiter wells were serially diluted and spot tested on YPD agar plates. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 2-days and photographed. A representative image is shown.
