 <caption> Antifungal activity of α-Cyperone against Candida and Cryptococcus species. ( a) C. krusei was grown in honeycomb microtiter wells containing RPMI 1640 medium in the presence (62.5 µg/mL &amp; 125 µg/mL) and absence of α-Cyperone for about 14 h at 37 °C. Fungus growth was measured by absorbance at optical density (OD) 600 nm using Bioscreen-C growth monitor. ( b) Control (−) and α-Cyperone exposed (+) (MIC dose) fungal cells from microtiter wells were serially diluted and spot tested on YPD agar plates. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 2-days and photographed. A representative image is shown. </caption>
