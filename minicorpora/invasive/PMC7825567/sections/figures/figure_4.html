 <caption> α-Cyperone inhibits the capsules in Cryp. neoformans. ( a) Representative images of control (+ solvent) and α-Cyperone (16 µg/mL, sub MIC) exposed Cryp. neoformans grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) for 48 h at 37 °C. Capsules were visualized by India ink staining and examined under a microscope (Leica). ( b) The size of capsules (in µm diameter) in control and α-Cyperone treated samples were determined using ImageJ software. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using a two-tailed t-test with Welch’s correction (GraphPad). p-value &lt; 0.0001. </caption>
