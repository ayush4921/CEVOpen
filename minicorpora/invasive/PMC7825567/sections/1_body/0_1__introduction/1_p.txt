0: Fungal diseases contribute to significant morbidity and mortality in humans.
1: It is estimated that nearly a billion people are infected with mucosal or superficial fungal diseases and 150 million people are affected with invasive fungal diseases [ 1].
2: The major invasive fungal infections include candidiasis, aspergillosis, cryptococcal meningitis, pneumocystis pneumonia, and histoplasmosis, which are responsible for over 1.6 million deaths globally [ 1].
3: People with compromised immune systems (e.g., HIV/AIDS, neutropenia) or with underlying health conditions (e.g., cancer, organ transplant, diabetes) are some of the high-risk groups affected most by invasive fungal infections.
