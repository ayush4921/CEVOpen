2: [ 18], -Cyperone showed a protective effect on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury/inflammatory response in mice by downregulating the NF-B and NLRP3 signaling pathways, mainly by upregulating SIRT1.
3: In another study, the neuroprotective effect of -Cyperone against H 2O 2-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in dopaminergic neuronal SH-SY5Y cells was demonstrated [ 19].
