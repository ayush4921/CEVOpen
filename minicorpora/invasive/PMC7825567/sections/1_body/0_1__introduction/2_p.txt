0: Among the various fungal pathogens that affect humans,  Candida albicans is the major fungus that is frequently associated with Candidiasis, causing a mortality rate up to 50% [ 2, 3].
1: Humans are a natural reservoir for  C. albicans, which colonizes on the mucosal surfaces (oral, GI, and urogenital tracts) and can disseminate systemically by their yeast-to-hypha conversion, leading to life-threatening invasive fungal infections.
2: Other species of Candida ( C. glabrata,  C. krusei) also contribute significant infections that are intrinsically resistant to fluconazole [ 4].
3: An emerging Candida fungal pathogen,  C. auris, is a major concern due to its pan-antifungal resistance, persistence in hospital environments as well as its invasive virulence potential with a high mortality rate (60%) [ 5, 6].
