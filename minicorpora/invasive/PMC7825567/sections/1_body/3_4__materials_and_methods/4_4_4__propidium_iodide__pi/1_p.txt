0: The fluorescent dye PI uptake assay was performed to understand the antifungal mechanism(s) of -Cyperone.
1: Control and -Cyperone treated  C. albicans and  C. krusei cells (16 h treated) were incubated with diluted PI solution in dark conditions for 30 min at room temperature.
2: Cells were washed with PBS and viewed under a fluorescent microscope (Leica, DM 6 B with a camera attached) using Texas red filter.
3: Untreated cells (autofluorescence) and heat-killed cells (positive control) were also included.
4: Similar results for  C. albicans and  C. krusei were observed and results only for  C. krusei are shown.
