0: The effect of -Cyperone on the  Cryp.
1: neoformans capsule was determined using a capsule inducing growth medium.
2: It was achieved by incubating  Cryp.
3: neoformans cells in microtiter wells containing Dulbeccos Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM) at 37 C in a cell culture incubator (5% CO 2) for two days [ 35].
4: Since the MIC concentration of -Cyperone was fungicidal, a sub-MIC concentration of -Cyperone (16 g/mL) was used.
5: Culture wells without -Cyperone (+solvent) served as the control.
6: Triplicate wells were used and the experiment was repeated at least twice.
7: Capsules were seen using India ink staining under a microscope (60 objective  10 ocular lenses) and images were recorded using a camera attached to the microscope.
8: The sizes of the capsules and cells in both the control and -Cyperone treated cultures were calculated in m using the scale bar function for scale measurements in the ImageJ software as described [ 35].
9: Statistical analysis of the data was performed using a two-tailed t-test with Welchs correction (GraphPad).
10: p-value< 0.0001 was considered statistically significant.
