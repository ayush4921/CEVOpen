0: Antifungal synergy was tested on  C. krusei using the checkerboard titration method.
1: Fluconazole and -Cyperone were diluted at different concentrations in buffered RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) containing 50 mM glucose.
2: Fluconazole concentrations between 0.24 g/mL to 62.5 g/mL, and -Cyperone concentrations from 7.8 g/mL to 500 g/mL were used.
3: Two-fold serial dilutions of fluconazole were performed going left to right on a 96-well plate with two-fold dilutions of -Cyperone being performed going from the top to the bottom of the plate.
4: The far-right column was used as an -Cyperone control, while the bottom row was used as a fluconazole control.
5: The control columns were then compared to the MIC of the two compounds being used together in order to calculate the FICI as described [ 23].
6: Synergism was defined as FICI< 0.5; additivity FICI between 0.5 and 1; indifference FICI between 1 and 2; and antagonism FICI > 2 [ 23].
7: Experiment was repeated three times.
