 <xref rid="B31-antibiotics-10-00051" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] were grown on YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) before using them for antifungal screening or test assays. The cultures were adjusted to required cell densities (1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>/mL) in buffered RPMI 1640 medium with 50 mM glucose according to the CLSI method for yeasts [
 <xref rid="B21-antibiotics-10-00051" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Antifungal compounds (α-Cyperone and fluconazole or amphotericin B) were tested using two-fold dilutions in 96-well microtiter plates. Each assay was performed in triplicate and repeated at least twice. Plates were then incubated overnight at 37 °C for 24 h statically, and then had their absorbance values recorded using a multi-well plate reader (Victor-3 multimode plate reader, Perkin Elmer). YPD agar medium was used for spot test assays.
