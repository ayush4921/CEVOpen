0: Fungal strains ( C. albicans,  C. krusei,  C. glabrata,  C. auris, and  Cryp.
1: neoformans) [ 31] were grown on YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) before using them for antifungal screening or test assays.
2: The cultures were adjusted to required cell densities (1  10 6/mL) in buffered RPMI 1640 medium with 50 mM glucose according to the CLSI method for yeasts [ 21].
3: Antifungal compounds (-Cyperone and fluconazole or amphotericin B) were tested using two-fold dilutions in 96-well microtiter plates.
4: Each assay was performed in triplicate and repeated at least twice.
5: Plates were then incubated overnight at 37 C for 24 h statically, and then had their absorbance values recorded using a multi-well plate reader (Victor-3 multimode plate reader, Perkin Elmer).
6: YPD agar medium was used for spot test assays.
