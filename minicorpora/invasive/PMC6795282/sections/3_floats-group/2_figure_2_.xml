  <p>Regression coefficients of the 14 predictor variables that explain the relative richness of naturalized (RRN) (A) and invasive (RRI) (B) plants relative to native plants of 761 and 359 regions worldwide, respectively. Data on human colonization were only available for islands. The coefficients were estimated by GLMMs, and the lines show their 95 % confidence intervals. Separate coefficients for mainland vs. island regions were used only if this separation yielded a lower AIC value than a single coefficient for both region kinds. Numerical predictor variables were standardized. The full models are provided in
