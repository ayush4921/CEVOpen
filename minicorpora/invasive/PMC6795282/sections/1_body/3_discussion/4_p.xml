<p>The higher RRN and RRI on islands compared to mainland regions may be influenced by the smaller size and peculiarity (e.g. reduced taxonomic and functional diversity;

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2017
 </xref>) of the native plant species pool on islands compared to mainland regions of equal size (

 </xref>), and partly also by high colonization pressure. For instance, the scarcity on islands of native plant species for utilitarian or ornamental purposes was a likely cause of particularly high numbers of alien plants being introduced for cultivation on islands. Further, islands are characterized by high levels of imports of goods (including within-country imports for islands that belong to mainland countries), which further increases propagule pressure in particular for hitchhiker species. It has been recently demonstrated that colonization pressure is essential to understanding global alien bird species richness (

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2016
 </xref>). However, disentangling the relative contribution of elevated colonization pressure and smaller native species numbers on islands for plants will require further data (e.g. numbers of introduced plants, and import volumes of goods, such as live plants, seeds and soil, that are known to bear high risks of introducing propagules) that could serve as proxies of the current, and ideally also historic, colonization pressure.
