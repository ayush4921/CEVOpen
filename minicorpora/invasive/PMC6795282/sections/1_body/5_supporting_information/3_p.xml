 <bold>Figure S2.</bold> The correlation of the relative richness of naturalized (A) and invasive (B) plants, i.e. number of naturalized and invasive plant species relative to native plant species numbers, and correlation of invasive per naturalized species numbers (C). Relative richness of naturalized and invasive plants are significantly different between islands and mainland regions (A, B; Mann-Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic> test: 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 in both cases), but there is no such difference between the ratio of invasive per naturalized species numbers (C; Mann-Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic> test: 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.35).
