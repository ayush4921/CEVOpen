0: The Global Naturalized Alien Flora (GloNAF) database ( van Kleunen   et al.
1: 2015 ,  2019;  Pysek   et al.
2: 2017 ) aims to cover the total ice-free terrestrial surface area of the globe, divided into countries andin particular for large countries and whenever data allowedsubnational regions (e.g.
3: provinces, federal states, islands;  van Kleunen   et al.
4: 2015 ;  Pysek   et al.
5: 2017 ).
6: In total, GloNAF includes 1082 regions with a varying degree of completeness of information.
7: In many cases, regions with different degrees of spatial resolution overlap or are nested (e.g.
8: US federal states nested in the USA).
9: Therefore, we have selected a subset of 838 spatially non-overlapping regions (composed of 495 continental regions such as countries or federal states, and 343 islands) based on data availability and the criterion of highest available spatial resolution.
10: For 761 regions there is information on naturalized plant species richness, and for 359 regions on invasive plant species richness ( Fig.
11: 1).
12: We extended the data with information on numbers of native species for all regions.
13: While the number of regions containing data on invasive species is substantially smaller because of a lack of data mostly for smaller subnational regions and islands, global data coverage remains high (c. 90 % of global terrestrial area) (cf.
