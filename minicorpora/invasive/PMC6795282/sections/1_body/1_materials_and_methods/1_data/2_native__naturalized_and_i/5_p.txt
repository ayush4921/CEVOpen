0: To standardize scientific names, each naturalized and invasive plant inventory was compared to The Plant List (TPL 2014, version 1.1;  http://www.theplantlist.org/; see  van Kleunen   et al.
1: 2015  for further details), the most comprehensive working list of all plant species ( Kalwij 2012).
2: This taxonomic standardization was done with the help of the R package  Taxonstand ( Cayuela and Oksanen 2014).
3: For each species, we kept the name accepted by The Plant List.
4: Species that were not found in The Plant List, also not after accounting for spelling differences, were kept in the database using the names as used in the source data.
5: In total, the database includes 13 168 species of which 13 033 are recognized by The Plant List (12 498 as accepted and 535 as unresolved names).
6: The remaining 135 species could not be identified as they do not occur in The Plant List, and among those 11 are ornamental cultivars of unknown origins.
