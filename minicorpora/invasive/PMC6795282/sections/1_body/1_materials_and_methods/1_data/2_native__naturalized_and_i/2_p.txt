0: Invasive alien species are a subset of naturalized alien species which often spread widely from the point of introduction ( Richardson   et al.
1: 2000 ;  Blackburn   et al.
2: 2011 ) and cause negative impacts on the environment ( Blackburn   et al.
3: 2014 ).
4: Somewhat different approaches to define invasive alien species exist.
5: Here, we followed the most widely accepted approach in environmental policy, the standard definition of the  CBD (2000): ...an alien species whose introduction and/or spread threatens biological diversity, in which the term invasive in effect consists of the subset of naturalized alien species which exert negative impacts on the environment.
6: This focus on negative impacts differs somewhat from the definition of  Richardson   et al.
7: (2000) , which focuses on the ability to spread and is widely used in invasion ecology: alien species that sustain self-replacing populations over several life cycles, produce reproductive offspring, often in very large numbers at considerable distances from the parent population and/or site of introduction, and which have the potential to spread over long distances.
8: Both definitions are nevertheless compatible and even if the criteria may slightly differ in individual cases, the resulting lists of invasive species are likely similar in global terms.
