0: The GloNAF database includes inventories of naturalized alien plant species (also including infraspecific taxa such as subspecies and hybrid taxa) for 761 regions around the globe  [seeSupporting InformationTable S3].
1: We consider alien species that have established self-sustaining populations without direct human intervention to be naturalized following  Richardson   et al.
2: (2000) ,  Pysek   et al.
3: (2004) ,  Blackburn   et al.
4: (2011)  and  Essl   et al.
5: (2018) .
6: The data sources include naturalized alien plant compendia, national and subnational lists of naturalized alien plant species published in scientific journals, as books or on the internet, as well as compendia of national or subnational floras with information on which species occur in the wild but are not native ( van Kleunen   et al.
7: 2019 ).
8: Our database also includes unpublished inventories of naturalized alien species that were specifically compiled for the GloNAF database (e.g.
9: for the provinces of China and the states of India)  [seeSupporting InformationTable S3].
