<p>Invasive alien species are a subset of naturalized alien species which often spread widely from the point of introduction (

 </xref>). Somewhat different approaches to define invasive alien species exist. Here, we followed the most widely accepted approach in environmental policy, the standard definition of the 
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">CBD (2000)</xref>: ‘…an alien species whose introduction and/or spread threatens biological diversity’, in which the term ‘invasive’ in effect consists of the subset of naturalized alien species which exert negative impacts on the environment. This focus on negative impacts differs somewhat from the definition of 
 <xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">Richardson 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (2000)
 </xref>, which focuses on the ability to spread and is widely used in invasion ecology: alien species that sustain self-replacing populations over several life cycles, produce reproductive offspring, often in very large numbers at considerable distances from the parent population and/or site of introduction, and which have the potential to spread over long distances. Both definitions are nevertheless compatible and even if the criteria may slightly differ in individual cases, the resulting lists of invasive species are likely similar in global terms.
