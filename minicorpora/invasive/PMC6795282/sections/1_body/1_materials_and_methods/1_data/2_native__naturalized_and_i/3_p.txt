0: To avoid the influence of different interpretations of the term invasive and to ensure a geographically balanced sampling, we based our consensus list of invasive alien plant species on three global data sources which contain standardized information on invasiveness: (i) the CABI Invasive Species Compendium ( http://www.cabi.org/isc/), which contains 672 plant data sheets with information on invasiveness in national and subnational regions, (ii) the ISSG Global Invasive Species Database ( http://www.iucngisd.org/gisd), which contains information on invasiveness of 2530 plant species, and (iii) the invasive plant species database by  Weber (2017) with information on 107 invasive plant species.
1: By using these global data sources, we are convinced that remaining uncertainties (e.g.
2: different interpretations of invasiveness) are moderate.
3: We extracted invasive plant species from these three data sources, standardized their scientific names (see below) and then built a consensus list for each GloNAF region including the invasive species recorded in these data sources.
4: This approach yielded data of invasive alien plant species numbers for 359 regions of the world.
