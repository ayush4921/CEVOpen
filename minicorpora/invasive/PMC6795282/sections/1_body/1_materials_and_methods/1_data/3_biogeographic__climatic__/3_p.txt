0: We selected indicators of human socio-economic activities that are known to affect alien species invasions: land use, i.e.
1: the proportion of agricultural land ( Chytry   et al.
2: 2008b ), and human population density ( Pysek   et al.
3: 2010 ;  Essl   et al.
4: 2011 ) per region.
5: We calculated the proportion of agricultural land and population density using data from the HYDE database ( Klein Goldewijk   et al.
6: 2011 ).
7: This is a spatially (5 longitude/latitude grid) and temporally high-resolution data set representing 12 000 years (10 000 BC to 2000 AD) of human-induced global land-use change.
8: Data on current climatic conditions (mean annual temperature, mean precipitation) were extracted from the WorldClim database ( www.worldclim.org;  Hijmans   et al.
9: 2005 ).
10: These data were used to calculate GloNAF-region means by averaging over all grid cells for each region.
11: All these variables reflect biogeographic, environmental and socio-economic factors that may modulate the RRN and RRI across the globe.
