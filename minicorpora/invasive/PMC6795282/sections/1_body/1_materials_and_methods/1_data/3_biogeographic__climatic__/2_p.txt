0: Isolation ( Moser   et al.
1: 2018 ) and the length of human presence have been suggested to be important predictors for plant invasions on islands.
2: Thus, for island regions, we additionally used recently published measures of their isolation (distance to the nearest mainland and landmass;  Weigelt and Kreft 2013), and compiled both pre-historic (first colonization by humans) and modern (first settlement by Europeans or descendants of Europeans) settlement dates  [seeSupporting InformationTable S3].
3: Other potentially relevant variables characterizing islands such as being an oceanic or continental island, or if islands have historically been connected to the mainland ( Weigelt   et al.
4: 2016 ) are closely correlated with isolation; thus, we did not consider these in the analyses.
