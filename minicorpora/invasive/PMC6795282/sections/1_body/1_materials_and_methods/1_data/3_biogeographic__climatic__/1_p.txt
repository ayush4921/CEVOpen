0: For each GloNAF region, we collected a range of variables which are assumed to relate to current RRN (= number of naturalized species relative to native species number) and RRI (= number of invasive species relative to native species number).
1: Each GloNAF region was assigned to one of nine continents of the TDWG continental scheme (further referred to as TDWG continents;  Brummit 2001).
2: We calculated the area of each region while considering only the ice sheet-free areas of each region, ranging from 0.03 to 4 331 903 km 2 (median: 28 836 km 2).
3: In addition, each GloNAF region was uniquely classified as belonging to a continental landmass (= mainland) or island, assigned to a hemisphere, Old/New World and the predominant broad climatic regime (zonobiome) to which the dominant vegetation type is closely associated (according to the Koppen-Geiger climate classification system;  Kottek   et al.
4: 2006 ;  Peel   et al.
5: 2007 ).
6: Spatial heterogeneity positively influences the number of niches available, which in turn may be colonized by alien plants.
7: We thus used topographic heterogeneity of the region, calculated as the standard deviation of the mean elevation of each grid cell (size: 30  30 geographic seconds, corresponding to c. 1  1 km at the equator; taken from  http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/) belonging to the respective region, as a proxy for environmental heterogeneity.
8: Variation in elevation is closely related to variation in climate, geology, geomorphology and land use, and therefore it is a useful measure of a regions heterogeneity ( Kerr and Packer 1997).
