0: To assess predictor variables for different effects on mainland vs. island regions, for all predictors except region area and those available only for island regions, initially separate coefficients were used for mainland vs. island regions by means of interaction terms with this binary factor.
1: However, to reduce models complexity and improve numerical stability these interactions were then subjected to a stepwise backward model selection and removed if the simplified model had a lower Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) value ( Akaike 1974).
