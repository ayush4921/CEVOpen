<p>Analyses of relative predictor importance and variation partitioning required plain linear models. We therefore worked on the linear predictor scale of the GLMMs by using log-transformed responses of species ratios (naturalized or invasive species numbers with native species numbers as offset variable) and absolute species numbers. In a first step, we fitted linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) using the same fixed- and random-effects structure as for each corresponding GLMM (except for the observation-level random effect which is not applicable to normal-distribution models), and subtracted the linear predictor contribution of all random effects from response values to yield a response adjusted for the impact of these random effects. We then fitted linear models using all fixed-effects variables (including the higher-order terms) of the GLMMs as predictors.</p>
