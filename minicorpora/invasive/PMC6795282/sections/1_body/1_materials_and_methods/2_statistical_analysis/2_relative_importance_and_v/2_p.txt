0: For relative importance analyses, we grouped all base and higher-order terms of a predictor and performed an  R2 partitioning by averaging over orders ( Lindeman   et al.
1: 1980 ) using the function  calc.relimp from the R-package  relaimpo ( Gromping 2006).
2: For variation partitioning based on adjusted  R2, we defined three major groups of variables (again including all higher-order terms of predictors), comprising (i) all biogeographic variables; (ii) all physical environment variables; and (iii) all socio-economic variables.
3: Mainland vs. island region and region area were used as core predictors included in all predictor subsets fitted for these analyses and ensured that interaction terms were supplemented by their respective base  terms.
