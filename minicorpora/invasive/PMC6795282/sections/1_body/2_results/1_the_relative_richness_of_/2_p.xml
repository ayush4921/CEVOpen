<p>After accounting for native species richness, RRN and RRI show a markedly different pattern across the globe. In total, 82 islands (i.e. 26 % of all islands in the data set) have accumulated more naturalized than native species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>; median: 48.1 naturalized species per 100 native species). Highest RRN values are found on islands in the subtropics and tropics. In contrast, RRN was on average much lower in mainland regions (median: 7.8 naturalized species per 100 native species). The only mainland region on Earth where the number of naturalized alien species exceeds the one of native species is the Chilean province of Iquique. This stark contrast between island and mainland regions is highly significant for RRN (Mann–Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic> test: 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), and even more so for RRI (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Islands have a median of 2.4 invasive species per 100 native species, with nine islands harbouring even &gt;25 invasive species per 100 native species. Mainland regions, in contrast, have a median of only 0.7 invasive species per 100 native species, with a maximum of seven in Shanghai. Again, this difference in RRI between islands and mainland regions is highly significant (Mann–Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic> test: 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). The percentage of naturalized species that have become invasive, in contrast, does not differ significantly between island and mainland regions (median for islands: 11.2 %; median for mainland regions: 9.2 %, Mann–Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic> test: 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.35)
