<p>Recently, 
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Dawson 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (2017)
 </xref> presented a cross-taxonomic study (based on eight taxonomic groups, including vascular plants) on global patterns and underlying drivers of naturalized alien species richness. In their study, they identified hotspots of naturalized plants and animals, found that these hotspots are primarily located on islands and coastal regions, and that socio-economic variables were particularly important for naturalized species richness. However, 
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Dawson 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (2017)
 </xref> differ in key attributes from this study: they focused on absolute species numbers and on a single invasion stage (i.e. richness of naturalized species), and their analyses of underlying drivers were based on a smaller set of explanatory variables.
