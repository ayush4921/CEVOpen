<p>A range of hypotheses have been proposed to explain the processes shaping the geographic patterns of alien species distributions (
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Catford 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2009
 </xref>). It has been argued that (i) islands are more susceptible to biological invasions compared to mainland regions (

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2018
 </xref>), (ii) regions in the southern hemisphere are more invaded than in the northern hemisphere (

 <xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">van Kleunen 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2015
 </xref>), (iii) New World regions that have been exposed to massive European settlement have received more alien species than Old World regions (

 <xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">van Kleunen 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2015
 </xref>), (iv) the extent of biological invasions differs between regions in relation to current and historical human impact (

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2010
 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Essl 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2011
 </xref>) and (v) that socio-economic pressures are more relevant for naturalized species richness than for invasive species richness (
 <xref rid="CIT0077" ref-type="bibr">Williamson 2006</xref>). Although much research has been devoted to testing the validity of these hypotheses and improved insights are highly needed for invasive alien species policy and management, a comprehensive analysis of the drivers mediating richness of naturalized and invasive plants at global extent is still missing.
