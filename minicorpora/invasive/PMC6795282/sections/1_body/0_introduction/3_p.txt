0: Biological invasions are interpreted as a sequence of stages separated by barriers that a species has to overcome before becoming a successful invader ( Blackburn   et al.
1: 2011 ), and regional studies have shown that the underlying drivers can substantially differ among invasion stages ( Dawson   et al.
2: 2009 ,  2013;  Richardson and Pysek 2012).
3: For instance, while socio-economic drivers underlying colonization effort are deemed crucial for introduction and naturalization ( Williamson 2006), invasiveness is assumed to depend more on species traits ( Pysek   et al.
4: 2009 ) as well as the interaction of alien species with native biota and the physical environment of the recipient region.
