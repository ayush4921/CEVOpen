0: Human-mediated dispersal of species into new regions has become a key feature of the Anthropocene ( Waters   et al.
1: 2016 ), redefining biogeographical realms ( Capinha   et al.
2: 2015 ) and homogenizing the worlds biota ( Winter   et al.
3: 2010 ;  La Sorte   et al.
4: 2014 ).
5: So far, ~4 % of all extant vascular plant species ( van Kleunen   et al.
6: 2015 ), and similar proportions of birds and mammals ( Blackburn   et al.
7: 2015 ), have established wild populations beyond their native range, i.e.
8: are naturalized ( Blackburn   et al.
9: 2011 ).
10: Also the number of naturalized species that have become invasive, i.e.
11: that spread widely ( Blackburn   et al.
12: 2011 ) and cause deleterious impacts on the environment and human societies ( Lambertini   et al.
13: 2011 ;  Simberloff   et al.
14: 2013 ), is substantial ( McGeoch   et al.
15: 2010 ;  Vila   et al.
16: 2011 ) and rapidly increasing ( Catford   et al.
17: 2009 ;  Hulme   et al.
18: 2013 ).
19: The numbers of naturalized plant species, however, vary among regions across the globe ( Pysek   et al.
20: 2017 ).
