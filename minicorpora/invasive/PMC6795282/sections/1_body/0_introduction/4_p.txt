0: Recently,  Dawson   et al.
1: (2017)  presented a cross-taxonomic study (based on eight taxonomic groups, including vascular plants) on global patterns and underlying drivers of naturalized alien species richness.
2: In their study, they identified hotspots of naturalized plants and animals, found that these hotspots are primarily located on islands and coastal regions, and that socio-economic variables were particularly important for naturalized species richness.
3: However,  Dawson   et al.
4: (2017)  differ in key attributes from this study: they focused on absolute species numbers and on a single invasion stage (i.e.
5: richness of naturalized species), and their analyses of underlying drivers were based on a smaller set of explanatory variables.
