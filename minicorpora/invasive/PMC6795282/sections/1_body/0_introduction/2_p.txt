0: A range of hypotheses have been proposed to explain the processes shaping the geographic patterns of alien species distributions ( Catford   et al.
1: 2009 ).
2: It has been argued that (i) islands are more susceptible to biological invasions compared to mainland regions ( Denslow   et al.
3: 2009 ;  van Kleunen   et al.
4: 2015 ;  Dawson   et al.
5: 2017 ;  Moser   et al.
6: 2018 ), (ii) regions in the southern hemisphere are more invaded than in the northern hemisphere ( Richardson and Pysek 2012;  van Kleunen   et al.
7: 2015 ), (iii) New World regions that have been exposed to massive European settlement have received more alien species than Old World regions ( di Castri 1989, but see  van Kleunen   et al.
8: 2015 ), (iv) the extent of biological invasions differs between regions in relation to current and historical human impact ( Pysek   et al.
9: 2010 ;  Essl   et al.
10: 2011 ) and (v) that socio-economic pressures are more relevant for naturalized species richness than for invasive species richness ( Williamson 2006).
11: Although much research has been devoted to testing the validity of these hypotheses and improved insights are highly needed for invasive alien species policy and management, a comprehensive analysis of the drivers mediating richness of naturalized and invasive plants at global extent is still missing.
