0: We characterized comparisons between introduced and home-range responses as either defense or competitive traits.
1: There were three models that addressed components of the defense hypothesis.
2: The first defense model included quantitative and qualitative leaf traits, such as concentrations of secondary compounds, density of trichomes, and leaf toughness.
3: The second defense model included the effects of herbivory in home- versus introduced-range plants upon herbivore performance, and included metrics from choice experiments or garden surveys such as developmental time of insects, insect mass, and number of insects.
4: The third defense model included herbivory-induced damage upon plants using metrics such as mass of plant consumed, area of leaves consumed, and regrowth following herbivory.
5: All effect sizes were modeled randomly, which is appropriate for ecological studies in which variation in measured effects is comprised of biotic variation as well as error.
6: In the case of significant summary effect sizes, fail-safe numbers (N R) were calculated to indicate the number of nonsignificant, unpublished results that would render the summary effect size nonsignificant.
7: If N R exceeded Rosenthal's identified minimum value (5n+10), the result was assumed to be robust against publication bias (Rosenthal  1979).
8: We used Metawin 2 (Rosenberg et al.
9: 2011) for all analyses.
