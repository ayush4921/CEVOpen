<p>Recent research on feedbacks suggests that interactions between abiotic and biotic factors, including the environmental impacts of invasive plants, may also serve as selective forces for invasive species. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figure 4</xref> shows that secondary chemistry varies by range, which in the framework of EICA suggests changes in herbivore pressure. However, models show that herbivory and resource availability may interact or act in opposition as selective forces on plant secondary metabolites (Zhang and Jiang 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b80">2006</xref>). Resource availability in the form of soil nutrients should be evaluated as a possible selective force for plant secondary chemistry, particularly as secondary metabolites can impact soil nutrient availability through effects on decomposition processes (Coley et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">1985</xref>; Schweitzer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">2004</xref>). Altered nutrient cycling rates have been implicated as an ecosystem-level impact of invasive species (Ehrenfeld 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">2003</xref>), but should also be evaluated as an important evolutionary feedback for invasive plant species. Furthermore, while EICA only considers the biotic interactions of herbivores and plant competitors as selective forces, more recent research shows that soil biotic communities have the potential to act as selective agents, as certain tree species including invasive
