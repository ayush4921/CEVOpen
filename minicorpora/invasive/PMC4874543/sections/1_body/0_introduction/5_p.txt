0: In an open-field mesocosm experiment, we set out to explore the performance of a community of old European vs. new North American plant communities when competing with one of the three geo-cytotypes of  C.  stoebe, and when growing in the absence of competition with  C.  stoebe.
1: Specifically, we tested (1) whether the tetraploid  C.  stoebe are more competitive than the diploid  C.  stoebe, irrespective of the origin of the tetraploids and the origin of the neighbours (evidence for an inherently higher competitive ability, i.e.
2: pre-adaptation), (2) whether tetraploid  C.  stoebe are particularly competitive when growing with a species mixture consisting of new, naive plant species from the introduced range (evidence for a context-dependent pre-adaptation) or (3) whether the NA tetraploids reveal a higher impact on resident communities in general or the NA community specifically than the EU tetraploids (evidence for post-introduction evolution).
3: Based on findings from an earlier pairwise competition study between tetraploid  C.  stoebe and individual EU vs. NA neighbours [ 38], we also assessed (4) whether the two neighbouring communities vary in their relationship between the biomass of  C.  stoebe and that of the neighbouring communities, and (5) whether this relationship differs among the three geo-cytotypes.
