0: Centaurea stoebe (syn.
1: C.  maculosa Lam., Asteraceae), is a widespread, short-lived forb native to Europe that was introduced into North America as a seed contaminant some 150 years ago [ 24].
2: In Europe (EU), it exists as two cytotypes, diploids (2n = 2x = 18) and allo-tetraploids (2n = 4x = 36), which occurs in predominantly single-cytotype populations [ 25 28].
3: However, so far, only tetraploids have been recorded from its introduced North American (NA) range, despite the higher frequency of diploid populations at home, a largely sympatric and similar geographic distribution of diploid and tetraploid populations in Europe [ 25,  26] and evidence for multiple introductions into North America [ 29], which all assumes that both cytotypes have been introduced.
4: The performance of the three  C.  stoebe geo-cytotypes (EU2x, EU4x and NA4x) has been well studied in the absence of competition [ 30].
5: Experimental evidence showed that the characteristics of tetraploid  C.  stoebe, e.g.
6: rapid growth, perennial life cycle, higher reproduction, increased phenotypic plasticity and increased drought tolerance [ 30 33], as compared to diploid conspecifics may have better pre-adapted them for invading the introduced range and may also explain the absence of the diploid cytotype in North America [ 25,  26,  34,  35].
