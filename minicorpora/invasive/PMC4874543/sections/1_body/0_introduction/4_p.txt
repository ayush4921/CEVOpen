0: Evidence for post-introduction evolution in  C.  stoebe by genetic drift or selection is mixed.
1: Ridenour et al.
2: [ 36] found that NA  C.  stoebe plants grew faster than plants from EU populations, but this may not result in increased biomass of mature plants or increased reproductive output [ 30].
3: Hahn et al.
4: [ 37] found earlier flowering and increased seed mass in North American tetraploids compared with European tetraploids and higher seedling emergence of tetraploid NA compared to tetraploid EU  C.  stoebe.
5: Those results have been explained as a trade-off between growth and defence traits (evolution of increased competitive ability (EICA)-hypothesis) [ 30], suggesting post-introduction evolution in introduced tetraploid populations.
6: Thus, present results indicate that a combination of pre-adaptation due to polyploidy and further post-introduction evolution that favoured the North American tetraploids may have contributed to their invasion success.
7: However, whether the three geo-cytotypes differ in their impact on the resident plant community and whether the impact is affected by the origin of the competing plant community (native vs. introduced range) and thus may differentially impact the geo-cytotypes ability as a driver of invasiveness has not been assessed simultaneously so far.
