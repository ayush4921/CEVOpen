<p>In an open-field mesocosm experiment, we set out to explore the performance of a community of old European vs. new North American plant communities when competing with one of the three geo-cytotypes of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>stoebe</italic>, and when growing in the absence of competition with 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>stoebe</italic>. Specifically, we tested (1) whether the tetraploid 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>stoebe</italic> are more competitive than the diploid 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>stoebe</italic>, irrespective of the origin of the tetraploids and the origin of the neighbours (evidence for an inherently higher competitive ability, i.e. pre-adaptation), (2) whether tetraploid 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>stoebe</italic> are particularly competitive when growing with a species mixture consisting of new, na√Øve plant species from the introduced range (evidence for a context-dependent pre-adaptation) or (3) whether the NA tetraploids reveal a higher impact on resident communities in general or the NA community specifically than the EU tetraploids (evidence for post-introduction evolution). Based on findings from an earlier pairwise competition study between tetraploid 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>stoebe</italic> and individual EU vs. NA neighbours [
 <xref rid="pone.0155712.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], we also assessed (4) whether the two neighbouring communities vary in their relationship between the biomass of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>stoebe</italic> and that of the neighbouring communities, and (5) whether this relationship differs among the three geo-cytotypes.
