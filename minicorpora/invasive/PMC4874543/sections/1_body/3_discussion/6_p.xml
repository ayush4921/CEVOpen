<p>The results of this study indicate that the invasive tetraploid cytotype of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>stoebe</italic> not only harbours traits that increase its population build-up [

 <xref rid="pone.0155712.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0155712.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], but also traits that inflict an inherently higher impact on naïve neighbours than diploid 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>stoebe</italic>. Our study also proposes that assessments of impact of alien plant species preferentially should be conducted in a competitive environment using the naïve neighbours from the introduced range. Up to date, only a small proportion of studies on invasive plant species specifically addressed impact by taking a biogeographic approach [

 <xref rid="pone.0155712.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Similarly to our findings, Callaway et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0155712.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] showed that 
 <italic>Rhaponticum repens</italic> (L.) Hidalgo (formerly 
 <italic>Acroptilon repens</italic> (L.) DC.), a highly invasive forb in North America, had stronger competitive effects against native North American species than against species native to Uzbekistan, the home range of 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>repens</italic>. The effects of leachates collected from 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>repens</italic> roots were weak but more negative on species from North America than on species from Uzbekistan. Canopies of 
 <italic>Prosopis juliflora</italic>, a native leguminous tree of the New World but an invader in many other regions, had facilitative effects on the diversity of other species in its native range. However, in India and on Hawaii, USA, where 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>juliflora</italic> is an aggressive invader, canopy effects were consistently and strongly negative on species richness [
 <xref rid="pone.0155712.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. 
 <italic>Chromolaena odorata</italic> (L.) R. M. King and H. Robinson had stronger competitive effects on native species from China (the invaded range) than on 
 <italic>native</italic> species from Mexico (the native range of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>odorata</italic>) under high nutrient conditions, and the germination and growth of species native to China was far more inhibited by extracts from 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>odorata</italic> leaves than those of species native to Mexico [
 <xref rid="pone.0155712.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Hence, while still more studies comparing the impact of an invasive plant at home and away are needed, there is a growing body of evidence that the biogeographic origin of species does indeed matter for understanding the impacts of invasive plant species (cf. Richardson and Ricciardi [
 <xref rid="pone.0155712.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] for the recent controversy in invasion science on “does origin matter”).
