0: To assess the competitive interaction with neighbouring communities from the home vs. introduced range, seeds of seven EU and seven NA perennial plants were either collected from the field (bulk samples of 1020 mother plants per population adjacent to a  C.  stoebe invaded site) or purchased from commercial suppliers in Europe and the USA for EU and NA plant species, respectively.
1: Neighbour species were chosen among plants naturally co-occurring with  C.  stoebe to represent five different functional groups ( Table 2).
2: We also selected EU and NA species within functional groups with similar overall growth rates and total biomass from previous greenhouse experiment ( 2 = 0.28, P = 0.60 and  2 = 1.38, P = 0.24 for growth rate and biomass, respectively; cf.

5: We analysed the Relative Efficiency Index (REI an indicator of mixture dynamics independent of initial plant size) among all chosen species (the data are from the previous pairwise competition experiment), and found no significant REI differences among EU species ( 2 = 5.38, P = 0.51) and marginally significant REI differences among NA species ( 2 = 12.01, P = 0.06; cf.

8: While a co-evolutionary history of the EU plants with  C.  stoebe is most likely at the species level, none of the seed material used in the experiment had a direct experience with  C.  stoebe.
