0: We used diploid (2x)  C.  stoebe from native Europe (EU) and tetraploid (4x)  C.  stoebe from both its home (EU) and introduced range (North-Western USA, NA).
1: Seeds of  C.  stoebe were collected from three EU2x, EU4x and NA4x populations each (bulk sample of 1020 mother plants;  Table 1), covering an important part of the species distribution in both ranges, i.e.
2: E- and C-Europe, where both cytotypes are widely distributed and the most abundant area in the introduced range (Pacific NW of the USA), respectively [ 25,  28].
