0: Neighbour plants from both ranges ( Table 2) as well as  C.  stoebe from EU and NA were grown from seeds in March 2012.
1: We sowed seeds of all species into seedling trays and grew germinated individuals in conetainers (2.5 cm surface diameter and 16.5 cm depth; Stuewe and Sons, Corvallis, OR) filled with commercial potting soil (Selmaterra, Eric Schweizer AG, Thun, Switzerland) mixed with sand and vermiculite (Vermisol , granular form, VTT AG, Muttenz, Switzerland) in the ratio 4:2:1.
2: The seedling trays and conetainers were kept in a CABI greenhouse and exposed to natural light condition, which was supplemented by metal halide bulbs (18h-light, 6h-dark) for seven weeks.
3: In May 2012, we transplanted seedlings of the seven EU/NA species into the containers at an average distance of 1214 cm.
4: We used two individuals each of the species in the functional groups grasses and midseason forb with spreading rhizomes in a native resident community ( Table 2), resulting in ten European ( Fig 1a) or ten North American ( Fig 1b) native neighbour plants per pot.
5: To keep the same competition ratio (1:1) between  C.  stoebe and its neighbouring community as in a previous greenhouse experiment (i.e.
6: Sun et al.
7: [ 38]), ten  C.  stoebe seedlings randomly drawn from all populations of the same geo-cytotype were transplanted into containers with or without neighbouring community.
8: The pattern of the spatial arrangement of the plants was the same in each container (see  Fig 1).
9: Containers were weeded weekly to avoid the emergence of seedlings of other species from the soil seed bank, and irrigation was maintained for four months (i.e.
10: May-August).
