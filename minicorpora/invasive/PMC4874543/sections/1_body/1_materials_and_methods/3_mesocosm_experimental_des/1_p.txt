0: The study was conducted in a fallow field next to the CABI Centre in Delemont (4722'N, 719'E), Switzerland.
1: Due to legal constraints, studies with populations from the introduced range have to be conducted under controlled conditions.
2: We thus chose to set up the experiment in 50 L containers (49 cm surface diameter and 40 cm depth) that were sunk completely into the ground.
3: Soil was excavated to a depth of 0.5 m, roots and rocks were removed, the soil mixed with 10 L vermiculite (Vermisol , 48 mm grain size, VTT AG, Muttenz, Switzerland) and filled into the containers.
4: Eleven treatments were set up by growing the EU and NA neighbouring community (10 individuals from seven EU or NA species) in the presence of the three  C.  stoebe geo-cytotypes (10 individuals from one of the three geo-cytotypes) and also in the absence of  C.  stoebe; the three geo-cytotypes of  C.  stoebe were also grown alone.
5: Each treatment was replicated nine times, resulting in a total of 99 containers.
