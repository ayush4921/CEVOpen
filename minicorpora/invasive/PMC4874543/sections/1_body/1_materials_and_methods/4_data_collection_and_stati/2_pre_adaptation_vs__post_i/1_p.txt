0: The biomass of neighbouring communities and  C.  stoebe in the absence/presence of competition was analysed using Tukeys Honest Significant Difference (HSD)  post-hoc comparison after one-way/two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with neighbouring community origin or/and geo-cytotypes of  C.  stoebe as fixed factors.
1: We assessed the impact of three geo-cytotypes of  C.  stoebe in the competition containers as the comparison among aboveground biomass of neighbouring communities.
2: For the proportion of flowering  C.  stoebe plants, a Generalized Linear Models (GLM) with quasi-Poisson error (due to over-dispersion, the dispersion parameter was more than 1.59 [ 39,  40]) was used, then ANOVA analyses were accomplished by comparing the model fits with model deleted independent variables in which we specified test = F. Multiple comparisons among factors were done using a  t-test based on the best model and pairwise comparisons within the factor were done using Tukey Contrasts.
3: We thus assessed the early relative reproductive capacity of three geo-cytotypes of  C.  stoebe in the competition containers as the comparison among the proportion flowering of  C.  stoebe.
