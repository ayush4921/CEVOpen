0: Mixed-effects regression models were used to analyse the correlation between log10- transformed biomass of neighbouring communities and  C.  stoebe in competition containers.
1: Origin of neighbouring communities was also included as fixed effects in a combined analysis of data sets.
2: As to the random structure, we compared a random intercept and slope model and a random intercept model using geo-cytotype as a factor, and used the likelihood ratio test from maximum likelihood (ML) fits for significance.
3: They indicated no difference between the common slope and the slopes of each of the geo-cytotype (P > 0.1).
4: Eventually, model-II simple linear regression (geometric mean regression) using standard major axis (SMA) method [ 41] was used because both x and y variables were measurements, to compute the relationship between log10- transformed biomass of neighbouring communities and  C.  stoebe.
5: All analyses were performed using R statistical software, version 3.0.1 (R Development Core Team, 2013).
