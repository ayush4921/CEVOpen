 <p>Our understanding of the potential mechanisms driving the spread and naturalization of alien plant species has increased over the past decades, but specific knowledge on the factors contributing to their increased impact in the introduced range is still urgently needed. The native European plant 
  <italic>Centaurea stoebe</italic> occurs as two cytotypes with different life histories (monocarpic diploids, allo-polycarpic tetraploids). However, only tetraploids have been found in its introduced range in North America, where 
  <italic>C</italic>. 
  <italic>stoebe</italic> has become a most prominent plant invader. Here, we focus on the ploidy level of 
  <italic>C</italic>. 
  <italic>stoebe</italic> and origin of neighbouring community in explaining the high impact during the invasion of new sites in the introduced range. We conducted a mesocosm experiment under open-field conditions with the diploid (EU2x) and tetraploid (EU4x) cytotype of 
  <italic>Centaurea stoebe</italic> from its native European (EU) range, and with the invasive tetraploid (NA4x) cytotype from the introduced North American (NA) range in competition with EU (old) or NA (new) neighbouring plant communities. In the presence of competition, the biomass of EU neighbouring community was reduced to a comparable level by all three geo-cytotypes of 
  <italic>C</italic>. 
  <italic>stoebe</italic>. In contrast, the biomass of the NA neighbouring community was reduced beyond when competing with tetraploid, but not with diploid 
  <italic>C</italic>. 
  <italic>stoebe</italic>. The fact that the biomass of all three geo-cytotypes of 
  <italic>C</italic>. 
  <italic>stoebe</italic> was correlated with the biomass of the EU neighbouring community, but not with that of the NA neighbouring community suggests that different mechanisms underlie the competitive interactions between 
  <italic>C</italic>. 
  <italic>stoebe</italic> and its old vs. new neighbouring communities, such as competition for the same limiting resources at home vs competition through novel allelo-chemicals or differential resource uptake strategies in the introduced range. We therefore caution to simply use the ecosystem impact assessed at home to predict impact in the introduced range.
