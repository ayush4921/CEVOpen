<p>Increasing ANPP over our study was unexpected, because typically employed precipitation and temperature trends (annual, Water Year and water recharge period) along with the absence of an increase in annual nitrogen availability suggest decreasing ANPP. Considering that the majority (&gt;88%) of ANPP occurred in late-May–June (the growing season), again the spring seasonal precipitation declined and temperature and cool season nitrogen remained unchanged. However, within the spring season, precipitation increased and temperature remained unchanged for the late-May–June period, so the ratio of precipitation to temperature (evapotranspiration) increased, which is consistent with the observed increasing ANPP. As a result, the observed late-May–June ratio of precipitation to temperature was positively correlated with ANPP (

 <xref rid="pone.0243496.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). First, ANPP was greater with higher ANPP in the prior year. Second, sampling sites were selected to provide an elevation gradient, and ANPP increased with elevation. Finally, the Julian day at peak “green” biomass was negatively correlated with percent of ANPP comprised of grass and positively correlated with late-May–June ratio of precipitation to temperature (
