<p>Grass ANPP relationships are the same as for total ANPP, but forb ANPP responded somewhat differently (
 <xref rid="pone.0243496.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). While forb ANPP responded positively with prior year forb ANPP and elevation, it only weakly increased with the ratio of June precipitation to temperature, and current year grass ANPP had a strong negative effect, indicating potential competition. Therefore, while grass ANPP benefitted by the changing environmental conditions, forbs did not and were reduced by the increasing grasses.
