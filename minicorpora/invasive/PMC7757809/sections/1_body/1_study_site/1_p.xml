<p>The National Bison Range (NBR) is one of the largest remaining tracts (~9000 ha) of intermountain bunchgrass prairie. It was never farmed and has been protected since 1908 as a U.S.F.W.S. refuge for bison (
 <italic>Bison bison</italic>). Prior to this, it was a cattle/bison ranch for less than 15 years. NBR bunchgrass prairie occurs at ~800 to 1400 m in elevation.
