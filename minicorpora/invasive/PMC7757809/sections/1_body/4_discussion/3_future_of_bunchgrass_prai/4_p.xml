<p>What the intermountain bunchgrass will look like in the future given climate changes and associated disturbances is uncertain? There is very little difference between our study valley with bunchgrass prairie (Mission Valley, MT) and an adjacent valley (Little Bitterroot Valley, MT) (respectively, average annual precipitation of 40.5 vs. 37.5 cm and annual temperature of 7.4 vs. 7.5°C) [

 <xref rid="pone.0243496.ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>] will replace the bunchgrass, as steppe is dominated by shrubs and we find that shrubs are declining (P &lt; 0.004, N = 35) along with other dicots. This is counter to Harte et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0243496.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] reporting that woody vegetation is replacing Colorado grassland with observed and experimental warming. If the observed increase in NBR grass ANPP and relative abundance continues, then historic bunchgrass ecosystem may morph into a different, possibly previously unknown, type of grassland. This uncertainty is consistent with claims that local and seasonal climate change may create very different ecosystems [
