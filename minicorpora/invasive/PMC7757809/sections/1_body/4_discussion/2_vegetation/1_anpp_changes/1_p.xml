<p>The few estimates of bunchgrass prairie ANPP range from 50–230 g-dry/m
 <sup>2</sup>, e.g., [

 <xref rid="pone.0243496.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], did not track ANPP changes among years or with environmental variables, or annual phenology. We found a much more variable ANPP (78–395 g-dry/m
 <sup>2</sup>) at NBR with variation among sampling sites within a year from 40–60% and variation among years within a site from 110–260%. NBR ANPP is known to increase with experimental addition of water and nitrogen fertilizer [

 <xref rid="pone.0243496.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0243496.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0243496.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. We observed ANPP to be positively correlated with the growing season (late-May–June) ratio of precipitation to temperature and with elevation. Elevation should be positively correlated with precipitation and negatively correlated with temperature, and we also observed it to be positively related to nitrogen availability. ANPP also increased with the previous year’s ANPP. Therefore, moisture (growing season ratio of precipitation to temperature) appears to be more important to ANPP than nitrogen.
