0: While changes in temperature and precipitation may directly affect grassland primary productivity, there may also be changes in nitrogen availability, the most common limiting nutrient.
1: First, some studies found precipitation and nitrogen availability in grasslands to be positively correlated, which makes it difficult to distinguish between water and nitrogen limitation for primary productivity [ 29, 30].
2: Second, if anthropogenic nitrogen in the atmosphere increases, then more will be deposited with increased precipitation [ 10].
3: Therefore, correlating precipitation changes with primary production may be due to water or nitrogen availability.
