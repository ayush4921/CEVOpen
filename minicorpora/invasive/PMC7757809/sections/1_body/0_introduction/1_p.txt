0: Anthropogenic induced changes in temperature and precipitation are projected to impact terrestrial primary production, e.g., [ 1 5].
1: Most of these projections focus on large spatial scales, such as biomes or across a large geographic region (>>1000 km 2) [ 6], not a local ecosystem or habitat within an ecosystem (<1000 km 2) [ 7 9].
2: In addition to climate change (e.g., temperature and precipitation), concurrently there may be increases in nitrogen availability (e.g., climate changing nitrogen mineralization, and atmospheric deposition of industrial/agricultural inputs) [ 10], the nutrient most often limiting terrestrial plant production.
3: Finally, these anthropogenic changes may affect more than primary productivity, if they modify the abundances of plant species that differ in their ability to respond to changing temperature, precipitation and nitrogen regimes [ 11 14].
