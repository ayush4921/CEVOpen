0: Grasslands are particularly important to humans by providing a disproportionate amount of agricultural and livestock production, as well as wildlife habitat [ 9].
1: As grasslands are often found in drier and warmer climates, they may be particularly susceptible to declining primary production and changing vegetation as climate changes [ 15].
2: Few long term data sets examine grassland responses to climate change, e.g., [ 8, 9, 16 28], and most examine large spatial scale responses to changes in annual temperature and precipitation.
3: However, Craine et al.
4: [ 23 25] indicate that seasonal shifts in temperature and precipitation may be more important at local spatial scales.
