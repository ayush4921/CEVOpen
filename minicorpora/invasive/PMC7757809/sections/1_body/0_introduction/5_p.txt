0: The bunchgrass prairie region is expected to become warmer and drier over time with anthropogenic climate change [ 8, 9].
1: If drying is observed, it should lead to greater water limitation, and possibly greater nitrogen limitation, as nitrogen mineralization and atmospheric deposition may decline with less precipitation.
2: Whether water or nitrogen is limiting, primary production should be declining over time, and drying should be increasing plant senescence over the normal summer dry period.
3: However, vegetation responses may depend on more than annual changes over time; therefore, we also examined changes over time in seasonality that may better explain vegetation responses.
4: In addition, climate change may affect the vegetations species composition, which impacts drought tolerance, fire resistance, and susceptibility to invasive species.
5: Finally, warming and drying might convert bunchgrass prairie into cold desert steppe.
