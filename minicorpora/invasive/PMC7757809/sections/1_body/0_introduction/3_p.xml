<p>While changes in temperature and precipitation may directly affect grassland primary productivity, there may also be changes in nitrogen availability, the most common limiting nutrient. First, some studies found precipitation and nitrogen availability in grasslands to be positively correlated, which makes it difficult to distinguish between water and nitrogen limitation for primary productivity [
