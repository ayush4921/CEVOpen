0: We examined how climate and nitrogen changes may be affecting an intermountain bunchgrass prairie.
1: Intermountain bunchgrass prairie, one of the most endangered ecosystems in North America, once covered ~11.7 million hectares of intermountain valleys from the Rockies west to the Cascades and from southern Alberta/British Columbia south to northern Utah/Nevada, but now is restricted to less than 100,000 hectares by agriculture and overgrazing (<1% of original area) [ 31 34].
2: Bunchgrass is overlooked in grassland studies, as U.S. Great Plains and desert grassland/steppe are often the focus [ 8, 9, 35].
3: Bunchgrass receives much less precipitation than the Great Plains as surrounding mountains create rain shadows, and little precipitation occurs in summer (JulySept) given prevailing Westerlies [ 36].
4: Furthermore, unlike the Great Plains, bunchgrass has a lower wildfire incidence due to less frequent lightning [ 36, 37].
5: Finally, bunchgrass may be especially sensitive to climate change, as its precipitation and temperature falls within a narrow range between that for cold desert and Great Plains mixed grass prairie [ 32, 38, 39].
