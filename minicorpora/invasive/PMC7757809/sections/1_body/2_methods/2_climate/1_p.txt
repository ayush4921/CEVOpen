0: Daily climate data (precipitation, maximum and minimum temperature) are available since 1909.
1: Data from 1909 July, 1999 are available from the NBR headquarters (795m: 707570E 5249753N).
2: Since July, 1999, the weather station was moved and data were not regularly collected.
3: Therefore, data were obtained from the AgriMet Round Butte, MT station (18.9 km away, 926m: 704653E 5268696W).
4: From 19892000, precipitation and temperature were highly correlated between NBR and Round Butte sites (precipitation: r = 0.94, N = 12, constant not different from 0, slope = 1.03 and p< 0.000001; temperature: r = 0.94, n = 12, constant not different from 0, slope = 0.94 and p< 0.000008).
