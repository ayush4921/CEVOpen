0: Plant nomenclature, family and life history (e.g., annual, biennial, drought resistance, fire tolerance and invasive) followed the U.S.D.A.
1: Plant Database ( http://plants.usda.gov/java/) [ 58].
2: U.S.D.A defines drought resistance and fire resistance as none, low, medium, and high.
3: Drought resistance is based on where species grow relative to soil moisture, and fire resistance is based on regrowth and reestablishment after fire ( https://plants.usda.gov  charinfo) [ 58].
4: We assigned values of 3, 2, 1 or 0 to the U.S.D.A indices (respectively, none, low, medium, and high), and computed average drought and fire resistance for the plant community ([U.S.D.As species drought tolerance or fire resistance index X species proportion]).
