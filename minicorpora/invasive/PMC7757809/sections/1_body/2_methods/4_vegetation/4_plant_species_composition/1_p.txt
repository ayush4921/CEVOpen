0: Plant species composition was obtained for 1978, 19801983 and for all years since 1997.
1: In June 1978, vegetation was clipped and sorted to species for 261 m 2 plots randomly located throughout NBR.
2: In June 19801983, vegetation was clipped and sorted to species for 300.1 m 2 plots randomly located at each of two sites (Hill & Triangle, which were sampled in 1978).
3: Since June 1997, point frame sampling [ 43, 48] was employed at the same two sites (Hill & Triangle), and all analyses were limited to these data, as earlier clipping samples were not comparable.
4: At 18 randomly-placed permanent locations (1 m 2) at one site and 9 at the other, 100 points in June and Sept were identified to bare ground, litter, moss, lichen, or plant species.
5: Plant species were identified using a number of keys [ 49 57].
