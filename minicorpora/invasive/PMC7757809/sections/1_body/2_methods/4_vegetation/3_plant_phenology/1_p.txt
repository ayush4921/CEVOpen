0: Two phenology measures were made using biweekly ANPP measurements (above): time when peak green biomass is attained and degree of summer senescence.
1: Time of peak green biomass was determined for each site and year as the Julian day when the greatest green biomass was observed.
2: Plant senescence (%) occurs over the summer (JulyAug) as green biomass dies or becomes dormant (brown) after peak green biomass occurs.
3: Senescence was measured as 100 X (1 lowest observed green biomass/peak observed green biomass).
