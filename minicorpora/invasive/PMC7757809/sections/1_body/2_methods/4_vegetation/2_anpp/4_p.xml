<p>To examine whether the two different methods affected ANPP measures, clipping and radiometer measures of ANPP were both made in 1994 and found to be highly correlated (r = 0.90, n = 4) with no tendency to over- or under-estimate ANPP (slope = 0.95 Â± 0.17). Furthermore, all subsequent statistical analyses were conducted with the method as an independent categorical variable and it was never significant (P always &gt; 0.30).</p>
