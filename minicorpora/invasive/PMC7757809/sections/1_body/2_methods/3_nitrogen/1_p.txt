0: Nitrogen available to plants was measured in 19942017 at four sites (Hill, Triangle, Trisky, Tower 2-grassy).
1: N measures were obtained twice a year (warm season: JuneSept, cool season: OctMay) using resin bags (Rexyn  Fisher Scientific) [ 41].
2: At each site, 3 bags were randomly buried 15 cm deep.
3: Bags were kept frozen after collection until analysis by extracting N with 2M KCl, and measuring NH 4+ and NO 3- with a Latchat  spectrophotometer [ 42].
4: Resin N is correlated with soil N mineralization at NBR [ 43].
