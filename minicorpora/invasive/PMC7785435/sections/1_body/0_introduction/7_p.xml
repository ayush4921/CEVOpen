<p id="p0030">Although 
 <italic>N. glauca</italic> has been ranked among the top six invasive plants that are damaging the biodiversity and altering the ecosystems in Saudi Arabia, no study dealt with the distribution and impacts of this noxious shrub. We hypothesize that understanding the ecological characteristics of 
 <italic>N. glauca</italic> at an early rather than late-stage will supports suitable control ways of this noxious plant and, inconsequence, restore natural vegetation. Therefore, the present study is aimed to assess the impact of 
 <italic>N. glauca</italic> on the seed bank of natural native vegetation of the different habitats Taif region, Saudi Arabia as well as determine the habitats with high seed bank of
