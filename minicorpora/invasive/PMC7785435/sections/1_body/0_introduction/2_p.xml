<p id="p0005">Invasive species are defined as those non-native species that threaten habitats and thus damage the structure and function of both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems (

 <xref rid="b0240" ref-type="bibr">Keller et al., 2011</xref>). Invasive species are considered fundamental causes of reduction in native species abundance and contributing to biodiversity loss and damage of ecosystem services in various environments (
