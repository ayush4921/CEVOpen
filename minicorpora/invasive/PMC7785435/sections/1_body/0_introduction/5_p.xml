 <xref rid="b0220" ref-type="bibr">Issaly et al., 2020</xref>). Now, 
 <italic>N. glauca</italic> is widely naturalized in warm temperate regions of the world (
 <xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">Florentine et al., 2006</xref>) and has spread worldwide through human activity. It is a successful invasive shrub in semi-arid areas. It has the ability to grow in a broad range of open and disturbed habitats, including roadsides, disturbed areas, rocky places, coastal beaches, arid grasslands, and flood plains, where it is growing as isolated patches, maybe up to 70 individual in each population (
