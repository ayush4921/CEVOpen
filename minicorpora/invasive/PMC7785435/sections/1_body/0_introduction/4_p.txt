0: There are many hypotheses describing the interactions involved in plant invasions.
1: According to the evolution of increased competitive ability hypothesis, introduced plants have the potential to reallocate resources as a defense mechanism against the native species ( Blossey and Notzold, 1995).
2: Based on the novel weapons hypothesis, invader plants become able to produce allelopathic agents as novel biochemical weapons, that interfere with the native plants and influence the plant-soil microbial interactions ( Callaway and Ridenour, 2004).
3: On the other hand, the biological resistance hypothesis states that ecosystems with high biodiversity are more resistant to invaders than ecosystems with low biodiversity ( Lonsdale, 1999,  Jeschke et al., 2012).
4: According to the enemy release hypothesis, the success of the invasion is due to absent enemies in the exotic range ( Heger and Jeschke, 2014).
5: The propagule pressure hypothesis posits that high propagule pressure (quality, quantity, and frequency of invasive organisms) is a cause of invasion success ( Lockwood et al., 2005,  Lockwood et al., 2013).
6: According to fluctuating resource hypothesis in plant invasion ( Davis et al., 2000), resource release through disturbance events make a site vulnerable to invasion at any particular point in time or space especially in low-resource environments ( Davis and Pelsor, 2001).
