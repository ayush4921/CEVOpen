0: Invasive species are defined as those non-native species that threaten habitats and thus damage the structure and function of both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems ( Pejchar and Mooney, 2009,  Keller et al., 2011).
1: Invasive species are considered fundamental causes of reduction in native species abundance and contributing to biodiversity loss and damage of ecosystem services in various environments ( Didham et al., 2005,  Shochat et al., 2010,  Duenas et al., 2018,  Linders et al., 2019).
2: Subsequently, the invasive species lead to community changes and ecosystem-level shifts, so they are an increasing challenge worldwide for the management of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning ( Brooks et al., 2004).
