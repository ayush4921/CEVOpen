0: Invasive plants are known to alter the nutrient cycling, soil moisture dynamics, and energy budgets, therefore affecting native flora, fauna and ecosystem services ( Liao et al., 2008,  Hulme et al., 2013).
1: Invasive plants usually precede native plants in the exploitation of water and nutrient resources, hence colonizing new habitats.
2: This is because most invasive plants have important characteristics such as short life-cycles, rapid growth, high reproductive ability, and highly competitive efficiency.
3: As a result, they succeed in various habitats and become superior to those of native species ( Abd El-Gawad and El-Amier, 2015,  Bonanomi et al., 2018,  Rai and Singh, 2020,  Wang et al., 2019,  Incerti et al., 2018).
