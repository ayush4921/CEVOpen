<p id="p0015">There are many hypotheses describing the interactions involved in plant invasions. According to the evolution of increased competitive ability hypothesis, introduced plants have the potential to reallocate resources as a defense mechanism against the native species (

 <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Davis et al., 2000</xref>), resource release through disturbance events make a site vulnerable to invasion at any particular point in time or space especially in low-resource environments (
