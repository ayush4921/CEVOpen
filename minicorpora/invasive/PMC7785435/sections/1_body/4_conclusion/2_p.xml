<p id="p0165">The invasive shrub 
 <italic>N. glauca</italic> growing in different habitats showed a substantial negative impact on the plant biodiversity. The seed bank outside the canopy of 
 <italic>N. glauca</italic> had higher richness and evenness of the understory species. However, some species were recorded only outside canopy and others under canopy. This contrasted results could be ascribed to either competition or facilitation by the invasive shrub, particularly the 
 <italic>N. glauca</italic> has been reported to release allelochemicals. According to the present results, 
 <italic>N. glauca</italic> is a new invasive species in Taif region, is expected to modify the biodiversity and soil properties of the study area in the future, particularly in Ar Ruddaf location, the most susceptible location according to the present data. The present study provides a deeper understanding of the most susceptible habitats or communities to the invasion by 
 <italic>N. glauca</italic> and thereby open the challenge toward control of this noxious plant and vegetation restoration.
