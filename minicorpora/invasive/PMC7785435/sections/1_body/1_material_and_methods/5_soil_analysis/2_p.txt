0: The collected soil samples, under- and outside canopy, were physically and chemically analyzed.
1: Moreover, fresh soil samples were collected in a moisture tin, and directly the soil moisture was determined by the weight loss method.
2: Soil samples were air dried at room temperature till complete dryness and then sieved through a 2-mm sieve to remove any contaminants.
3: The soil texture was determined according to  Bouyoucos (1962), while soil electrical conductivity (EC) and pH were determined in the soil solution (1:5) ( Rowell, 1994).
4: The Cl and SO 4 were determined in the soil solution using the titration method, whereas Ca, Mg, Na, and K, were determined using a flame photometer according to  Rhoades (1982).
5: Available nitrogen was determined by the Kjeldahl method as described by  Bremner and Mulvaney (1982), while available phosphorus was determined colorimetrically as described by  Nelson and Sommers (1982).
