0: The plant species diversity of the seed bank of all stands was determined by calculating species richness (Simpson index) and species evenness (Shannon-evenness) according to the following equations: Simpsonindex(S)=i[nini-1][NN-1]Shannon-WienerindexH=i=1sPiln(Pi)Shannon-EvennessindexE=Hlnswhere  P  i = n  i/N =  proportional abundance of species,  i in a habitat made up of  s species,  n  i = the number of quadrats containing species  i and  N = S n  i.
