0: Within the study area, three locations were chosen around Taif region, with elevations ranging from 1600 to 2500 m.a.s.l.
1: These were the most invaded location in Taif region.
2: Moreover, six stands were chosen to represent different habitats, including two stands form Alwaht (WHT), three stands from Ash-shafa (SHFA), and one stand from Ar-Ruddaf (RDF) ( Table 1 &  Fig.
3: 1).
4: The number of stands per each location was determined to cover the area, i.e.
5: according to the area size of the location and the invaded patches.
6: From each stand, three soil samples were collected under the canopy of three  N. glauca shrubs or outside canopy, in May 2019.
7: In detail, the litter layer was removed, and surface soil sample with volume  4000 cm 3 (area [20  20 cm] and depth [10 cm]) was taken from three random locations under the canopy of  N. glauca shrubs and merged as a composite soil sample.
8: A similar three soil samples were collected outside the canopy of  N. glauca, by at least 5 m. A total of 36 samples (6 stands  3 replications [shrubs]  2 treatments [under and outside canpoy]) were collected in plastic bags, labeled, and transferred to the greenhouse in the College of Food and Agricultural Sciences, King Saud University, Saudi Arabia.
