<p id="p0040">Within the study area, three locations were chosen around Taif region, with elevations ranging from 1600 to 2500 m.a.s.l. These were the most invaded location in Taif region. Moreover, six stands were chosen to represent different habitats, including two stands form Alwaht (WHT), three stands from Ash-shafa (SHFA), and one stand from Ar-Ruddaf (RDF) (

 <sup>3</sup> (area [20 × 20 cm] and depth [10 cm]) was taken from three random locations under the canopy of 
 <italic>N. glauca</italic> shrubs and merged as a composite soil sample. A similar three soil samples were collected outside the canopy of 
 <italic>N. glauca</italic>, by at least 5 m. A total of 36 samples (6 stands × 3 replications [shrubs] × 2 treatments [under and outside canpoy]) were collected in plastic bags, labeled, and transferred to the greenhouse in the College of Food and Agricultural Sciences, King Saud University, Saudi Arabia.
