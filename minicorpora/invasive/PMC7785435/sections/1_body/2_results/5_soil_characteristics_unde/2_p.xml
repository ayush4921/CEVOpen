 <italic>N. glauca</italic> of the three studied locations (SHFA, WHT, and RDF) are shown in 
 <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Moreover, the detailed soil analysis of all stands was presented in Table S1. The N, P, Cl, EC, Ca, Mg, N, K, and clay contents showed significant differences among the studied locations. However, pH, SO4, silt, sand, and moisture content did not show a significant difference (
