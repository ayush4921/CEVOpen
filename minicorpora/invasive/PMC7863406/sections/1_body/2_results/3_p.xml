<p>In total, 78% recorded tiger beetles were collected from alien/invasive tree species while only 22% from native ones. All beetles were noted on tree species characterized by presence of extrafloral nectaries on their different parts (91% if 
 <italic>Mangifera indica</italic> is excluded as in case of this species presence of such nectaries is sometimes questioned). Invasive 
 <italic>Spathodea campanulata</italic> was the most preferred tree with a total of 56% of Cicindelidae (128 individuals) noted in the study, including, respectively, 125 specimens of 
 <italic>Tricondyla elongata</italic> (65% individuals of the species), two individuals of 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>cavifrons</italic> (7% of the species), and a single 
 <italic>Neocollyris</italic> cf. 
 <italic>albitarsis</italic> (25% of the species). Native 
 <italic>Hibiscus tiliaceus</italic> and 
 <italic>Erythrina fusca</italic> were recorded as the second and the third preferred tree by tiger beetles (respectively, 19% and 13% of all collected specimens) followed by alien taxa 
 <italic>Mangifera indica</italic> L. (9%), and 
 <italic>Acacia mangium</italic> (4%). The result of Mann–Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic> tests shown nonsignificant differences between number of tiger beetles recorded on alien/invasive and native trees.
