<p>In the Philippines, more than 40 alien plant taxa have been noted including at least 11 tree species (Global Invasive Species Database, 
 <xref rid="ece37149-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). They originate from different regions of the world and were introduced for their utilitarian or ornamental values. As occurrence and distribution of some of such tree species can be supported by different animals, for example, flower pollinators or seed collectors (Corlett, 
 <xref rid="ece37149-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">1998</xref>; Forget &amp; Milleron, 
 <xref rid="ece37149-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">1991</xref>; Nathan et al.,

 <xref rid="ece37149-bib-0061" ref-type="ref">1998</xref>), some of them started to occur in many seminatural and natural areas. Although there is a lack of detailed studies focused on majority of alien tree species in the Philippines, usually influence of such alien/invasive plants on natural environment seems to be negative (e.g., Dostál et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37149-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Harvey &amp; Fortuna, 
 <xref rid="ece37149-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). On the other hand, every single tree (including invasive species) constitutes unique microecosystem occupied by numerous animals, what is especially well seen in case of insect diversity in the tropics (Erwin, 
 <xref rid="ece37149-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">1982</xref>; Erwin &amp; Scott, 
 <xref rid="ece37149-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">1981</xref>).
