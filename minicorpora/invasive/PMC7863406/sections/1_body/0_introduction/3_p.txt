0: Tiger beetles (Coleoptera: Cicindelidae) are group of predatory insects hunting mainly on various small invertebrates (Pearson & Vogler,  2001; Rewicz & Jaskua,  2018).
1: In the Philippines, more than 160 taxa of tiger beetles have been noted (Anichtchenko & Medina,  2019,  2020; Cabras et al.,  2016; Dheurle,  2016,  2019; Medina et al.,  2019,  2020; Wiesner & Dheurle,  2018; Zettel & Wiesner,  2018) including 14  Tricondyla Latreille et Dejean, 1822 and 29  Neocollyris Horn, 1901 species of which almost 90% are endemic to this country (Cabras et al.,  2016).
2: Although there is no detailed study devoted to prey preferences of arboreal  Tricondyla or  Neocollyris species, unspecified ant species are suggested as one of the most important types of prey both for larvae and adults of these antmimicking tiger beetles (Naviaux,  2002; Pearson & Vogler,  2001; Trautner & Schawaller,  1996).
