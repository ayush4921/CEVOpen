0: Adult tiger beetles were collected through opportunistic sampling from tree trunks, branches, and leaves using entomological hand net from 9 April to 4 August 2019 in the municipality of Masiu, Saguiran, and Marawi City, Lanao del Sur Province, Mindanao, Philippines.
1: A total of 10 sampling sites were established in these areas (Table  1).
2: Some sampling sites were visited several times, while others surveyed once due to time constraints and availability.
3: During every visit in every sampling site, all specimens of every tree species present in particular areas were checked (Table  1).
4: Sampling sites were located in humandisturbed habitat close to human settlements or even in the villages.
5: In total, over 10 tree and large, treelike perennial species have been checked, including three taxa alien and/or invasive for the Philippines (Figure  1):  Spathodea campanulata P. Beauv.
6: (native to Africa, one of the most invasive tree species in the world),  Mangifera indica L. (native to continental southeast Asia), and  Acacia mangium Willd.
7: (native to Australia, Papua, and Moluccas).
8: Moreover seven native taxa,  Erythrina fusca Lour.,  Hibiscus tiliaceus L.,  Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam.,  A. odoratissimus Blanco,  Cocos nucifera L.,  Musa spp., and  Bambusa spp., have been checked as well.
9: According to literature (Elias & Prance,  1978; Feinsinger & Swarm,  1978; Peng,  2015; Savage et al.,  2009; Seibert,  1948; Sugiura et al.,  2006; Zhang et al.,  2012; Zimmermann,  1932), all invasive species and first two of the mentioned native taxa can be characterized by presence of extrafloral nectaries.
