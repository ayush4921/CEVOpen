<p id="Par10">Seed imbibition did not exert any significant effect on seed survival curve at any aging time when compared with non-disinfected dry seeds (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). However, clear practical benefits were found when placing seeds on the aging container with water using a Pasteur pipet, instead of placing them one by one in dry with tweezers. In spite of the fact that imbibed seeds and non-disinfected dry seeds showed no significant differences within the viability loss interval (0–120 h), the lack of seed disinfection promoted fungus attacks from the 7th aging day in some replicates, which contributed to discard this treatment.
