<p id="Par8">Temperature strongly influenced seed survival curves and their medium longevity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The lowest tested temperature (43 °C) led to a constant and unhurried loss of seed viability of only a 20% loss in 18 days (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). Similar aging pace was observed at 45 and 50 °C but an abrupt change was observed at 55 °C, leading to the typical sigmoidal seed survival curve (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). Higher temperatures induced 100% viability loss between 3 and 24 h under 60 °C and less than 3 h under 95 °C (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). Those temperatures led to the apparition of burned embryos with brownish coloration. The L
 <sub>50</sub>, the time required to reach a 50% viability loss decreased sharply with increasing temperatures, from around 45 days under 43-45 °C to just a few hours at 60 °C (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). Temperatures above 55 °C may offer artificial aging intervals within a week, as L
 <sub>50</sub> was found between 2 and 3 days of aging treatment. Seed viability did not decrease linearly with temperature and aging time, instead, a strong inflection point was observed around 55 °C when contrasting aging time, temperature and seed viability (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c).
