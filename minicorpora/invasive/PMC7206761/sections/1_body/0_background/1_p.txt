0: Seed longevity is described as the period over which a seed remains viable and capable of germination [ 1].
1: The length of time during which seeds maintain their viability and vigor is a trait of interest not only for crop species within breeding programs and food security, but also for describing natural populations dynamics and assess persistence potential [ 2 4].
2: Seed longevity is strongly variable, ranging from just a few months in soybean [ 5], to more than 2000 years in  Phoenix dactylifera [ 6].
3: In species with orthodox seeds, viable seeds may enter dormancy, a temporal suppression of germination under favorable conditions, thanks to their ability to tolerate considerable desiccation [ 7].
4: The slow pace of seed viability loss in orthodox species hinders the study and characterization of species seed longevity under natural conditions.
5: Due to those difficulties, ex situ aging tests are used to estimate seed longevity and vigor [ 8].
6: Genetic factors have a key influence on seed persistence and because of this, the survival of seeds experiencing moisture and temperature stress in the laboratory is thought to be a good predictor of their potential persistence in the environment [ 1].
7: In fact, similar molecular events were found to accompany artificial and natural seed aging processes [ 9].
8: Long et al.
9: [ 10] successfully predicted species seed persistence in the field with the species ranking of the days taken for seed viability to decline by 50% in an artificial aging test.
10: A faster viability decay under artificial aging conditions is linked to a germination depression with time [ 11].
11: There are different proposed approaches to estimate and contrast seed longevity by generating an atmosphere that speeds up the aging process: accelerated aging and controlled deterioration.
12: Controlled deterioration tests were first developed to identify low vigor seeds [ 12] and consist of subjecting to high temperatures (around 4045 C) prearranged high seed moisture content (from 18 to 24%) for 24 to 96 h [ 13].
13: In contrast, accelerated aging (AA) tests consist of exposing seeds to high temperatures around 4045 C over water, generating an atmosphere with high relative humidity (RH).
14: The AA test was first developed by Delouche and Baskin [ 14] to estimate the longevity of seeds stored in a warehouse, as the decline in germination following AA is proportional to the initial physiological potential of the seed lot.
15: Seed lots with high vigor should be able to withstand these stress conditions and will deteriorate at a slower rate than lots with poorer vigor [ 8].
16: The AA test is preferable for a rapid method as it does not require initial seed moisture control and equilibration, which may suppose extra time and offers similar results to the controlled deterioration test [ 13].
