0: The preparation of the aging containers was performed as follows: first, containers and sized meshes were disinfected with 70% ethanol and filled with 700 ml of aging solutions: water or NaCl saturated solution (See relative humidity experiment below).
1: Mesh was fixed using masking tape.
2: Seeds were submerged in 0.1% bleach for 30 s and 10% ethanol for 30 s more and washed multiple times with distilled water.
3: Containers were only opened when the aging treatment ended at the chosen time: from 3 to 18 days.
4: At that moment, seeds were prepared for the viability test as described in the succeeding sections.
5: Zero aging hours corresponds to viability (through tetrazolium viability test) or germination assessment on non-artificially aged seeds for viability and germination tests respectively.
