0: Different containers were tested regarding their surface/volume ratios to maximize seed disposition and effectivity and preservation of the aging conditions.
1: It was concluded that a commercial polypropylene hermetic container of 1.1L capacity with a 20  5 cm surface (PlasticForte, Spain) was ideal to generate a controlled atmosphere that maintains the desired RH and hold the seeds at a determined point with 70% of the capacity filled with aging solution (Fig.
2: 1).
3: There was an exception at 95 C where due to the temperature, the experiment was performed using glass jars.
4: Five replicates per population, including fifty seeds per replication were used.
