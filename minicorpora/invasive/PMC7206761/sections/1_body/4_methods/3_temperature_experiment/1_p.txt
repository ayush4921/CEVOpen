0: The role of aging temperature, RH and seed imbibition and disinfection on the seed survival curve in terms of seed viability was tested.
1: The general aging procedures suggest the use of 4143 C in a high humidity environment for a specified duration (4872 h) [ 8,  15].
2: However, seeds from some Aizoaceae species are known to resist even higher temperatures for a short period of time [ 42].
3: Considering this, aging was tested at the following spectrum temperatures: 43, 45, 50, 55, 60, 95 C using a laboratory oven under high humidity conditions using distilled water aging solution inside the containers that generated an atmosphere of 87% RH.
