0: Seed imbibition is recommended in tetrazolium viability tests (see seed viability section) because it softens the seed coat and activate enzymatic systems [ 52].
1: In order to standardize conditions for initial viability measurement and accelerated aging conditions, imbibition was also proposed before accelerated aging.
2: Seed imbibition was performed with distilled water during 24 h (for its compatibility with the normal laboratory routine) in the dark and at room temperature.
3: Unlike imbibed seeds, dry seeds were not disinfected to maintain the dry conditions and compare the seeds dry original state and the imbibed and disinfected seeds.
4: Using a Pasteur pipette for imbibed and tweezers for dry seeds, seeds were distributed into the 10 cm 2 filter paper that was placed on the containers mesh together with other replicates.
