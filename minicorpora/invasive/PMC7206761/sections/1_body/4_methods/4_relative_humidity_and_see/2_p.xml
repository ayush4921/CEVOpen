<p id="Par26">Seed imbibition is recommended in tetrazolium viability tests (see seed viability section) because it softens the seed coat and activate enzymatic systems [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. In order to standardize conditions for initial viability measurement and accelerated aging conditions, imbibition was also proposed before accelerated aging. Seed imbibition was performed with distilled water during 24 h (for its compatibility with the normal laboratory routine) in the dark and at room temperature. Unlike imbibed seeds, dry seeds were not disinfected to maintain the dry conditions and compare the seeds dry original state and the imbibed and disinfected seeds. Using a Pasteur pipette for imbibed and tweezers for dry seeds, seeds were distributed into the 10 cm
