0: To evaluate the role of RH inside the aging container, distilled water and a saturated commercial NaCl solution (40 g/100 ml H 2O) were used.
1: Saturated salt solutions are often used for controlling environmental variables as they generate a defined RH environment, inferior to a water-saturated atmosphere [ 44].
2: Relative humidity and temperature inside the aging container were tested by introducing a data logger sensor (EasyLog, Lascar Electronics) and a wireless digital thermometer and hygrometer (WA10-Kira EU, Oria) after different time intervals (24, 48, 72 and 96 h inside aging containers).
