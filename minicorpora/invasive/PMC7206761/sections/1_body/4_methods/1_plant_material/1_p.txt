0: A first lot of  C. edulis seeds was selected to test the aging conditions from a natural population growing in Premia de Mar (Spain, 41 29 24.2 N 2 21 49.3 E).
1: Once aging conditions were set, seeds from two natural populations of  C. edulis were selected because of their large number of individuals and their large seed availability (population 1: 41 28 25.5 N 2 17 54.7 E; population 2: 41 28 30.3 N 2 18 04.6 E).
2: These populations were used to test the accelerated aging test.
3: From each population, within the period of natural seed rain, 600 fruits were collected to ensure representativeness.
4: Fruits were opened and all the obtained seeds were pooled (more than 10.000 seeds per population).
5: Seeds were kept at darkness and room temperature until analysis (34 weeks).
6: Prior to start the accelerated aging tests, seed moisture content (%) was measured for both populations as: FW  DW*100/DW, where FW stands for 50 seeds fresh weight and DW for those 50 seeds dry weight (obtained after 72 h at 70 C) with five replicates.
7: In the two populations, accelerated aging through viability tests and germination was tested as described in the following sections.
