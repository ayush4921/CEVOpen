0: Significant differences between aging time or temperature were tested using a one-way ANOVA, evaluating the effects of the fixed factor Aging time for the different variables in Fig.
1: 4 and the fixed factor Temperature in Fig.
2: 2b using Tukey test to contrast differences between factor levels in R 3.5.0.
3: A four-way ANOVA was used to test the effects of the three fixed factors: Relative humidity, Temperature, Aging time and Imbibition, for the times 0, 24, 48 72, 96 h, assuming that viability at 43 C after 24 and 48 h was equal to 72 h in Fig.
4: 3a.
5: Normality and homoscedasticity were confirmed using the ShapiroWilk and Levene tests respectively.
6: Seed survival curves were fitted using the  drc R package for doseresponse curves fitting that include different adjustments, including Weibull models that can contemplate asymmetrical losses responses [ 62].
7: The best model was selected using the AIC criteria.
8: Longevity parameters (L 5, L 50 and L 95) were estimated using the ED function from the  drc R package.
9: SigmaPlot 10.0 (Systat, USA) was used to create the presented plots.
