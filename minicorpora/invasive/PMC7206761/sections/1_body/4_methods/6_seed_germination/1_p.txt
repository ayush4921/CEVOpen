0: Seed germination was performed as described in Novoa et al.
1: [ 60] and Podda et al.
2: [ 61] with brief modifications on artificially aged seeds of populations 1 and 2 for the different aging times (0, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 h).
3: Different conditions of pH, temperature alternation and acid pre-treatment were tested, obtaining the best results with 12 h photoperiod with temperature alternation between 25 C during the day and 10 C at night.
4: Germination was assessed every three days over wet Whatman paper (90 mm No.
5: 1 filter) in petri dishes.
6: Five replications per population, including fifty seeds per replication were used.
7: Final germination percentage was estimated after curve saturation at 70 days.
8: Mean germination time and mean germination rate were estimated using the  GerminaR package in R 3.5.0.
