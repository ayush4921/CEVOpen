<p id="Par28">Seed germination was performed as described in Novoa et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] and Podda et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] with brief modifications on artificially aged seeds of populations 1 and 2 for the different aging times (0, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 h). Different conditions of pH, temperature alternation and acid pre-treatment were tested, obtaining the best results with 12 h photoperiod with temperature alternation between 25 °C during the day and 10 °C at night. Germination was assessed every three days over wet Whatman paper (90 mm No. 1 filter) in petri dishes. Five replications per population, including fifty seeds per replication were used. Final germination percentage was estimated after curve saturation at 70 days. Mean germination time and mean germination rate were estimated using the 
 <italic>GerminaR</italic> package in R 3.5.0.
