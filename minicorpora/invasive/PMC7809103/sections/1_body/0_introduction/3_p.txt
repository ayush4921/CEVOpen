0: Invasive insect herbivores have the prospective to significantly hamper with prevailing insect parasitoids species in invaded areas; this mechanism can occur in different ways: (1) interferences with the volatiles that attract the insect parastoids to unsuitable the host; if the plants can be infested by both the native and invader, the later produces volatiles that are less attractive to parasitoids 19; and (2) the parasitoids can attempt to parasitize the invasive insect, with low chance to complete their development.
1: This is considered as a waste of time and energy that can negatively affect the fitness of the parasitoids 19,  20.
2: These interferences can therefore have detrimental consequences on a pre-existing biological control process 21.
