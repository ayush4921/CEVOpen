0: In SSA, the noctuid stemborers  Busseola fusca (Fuller) and  Sesamia calamistis (Hampson) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), and the crambid stemborer  Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) are economically the most important lepidopteran pest species that severely limit maize productivity as a result of a continuous infestation of the crop throughout its growth stages 9,  10.
1: In maize fields, these stemborers may occur as single species or as a community of mixed species 11,  12.
2: Among these stemborers,  C. partellus is exotic and invaded eastern Africa in the 1930s 9.
3: This species has competitively displaced  B. fusca in the highlands of South Africa 13.
4: It has also displaced  Chilo orichalcociliellus Strand (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) in the coastal region of Kenya 14 and might get an advantage over  S. calamistis in the utilization of maize in the context of future climate change 6,  15.
5: Recently,  S. frugiperda invaded SSA, where it seriously limits maize yields 16,  17.
6: Field observations indicated that it interacts strongly with maize stemborer systems 18 and might also displace them.
