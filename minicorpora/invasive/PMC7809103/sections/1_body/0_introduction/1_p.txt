1: Maize is one of the most important cereal crops in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) 2.
2: In Kenya, maize is grown predominantly by smallholder farmers 3 and constitutes a vital source for household livelihoods 4.
3: The productivity of maize is affected by a wide array of biotic and abiotic stresses that reduce the quantity and quality of its yields.
4: Insect pest pressure is among the major threats that constrain maize crop from reaching its maximum potential yields.
5: A complex of lepidopteran stemborers and the recent invasive fall armyworm  Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E.
6: Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) are the primary pests of maize crop in many parts of the world, including Kenya, causing yield losses ranged from 30 to 70% 3,  5.
7: These pests are responsible for significant losses of maize upon infestation.
8: Evidence to date suggests that with climate change, these pests are continuing to spread to new areas 6  8.
