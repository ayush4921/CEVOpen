<p id="Par13">In four pest species system, 
 <italic>C. partellus</italic> was the dominant species (48.79%), followed by 
 <italic>S. calamistis</italic> (28.34%), 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> (14.85%) and 
 <italic>B. fusca</italic> (8.02%), respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>E), with the same trend of their associated parasitoids (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>F). Comparing four pest species system populations to those in three pest species systems, the population of each pest species declined except that of 
 <italic>C. partellus</italic>. The total average pest populations in three-pest species systems represented only 89.88% of those in four pest species system.
