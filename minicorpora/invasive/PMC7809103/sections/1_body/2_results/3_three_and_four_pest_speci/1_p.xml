<p id="Par12">In three species systems after 6 months, 
 <italic>C. partellus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> co-exist representing 45.45% and 40.42% of the total pest populations in the system but competitively dominated 
 <italic>B. fusca</italic> population that represented only 14.13% (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). However, in 
 <italic>C. partellus</italic> + 
 <italic>S. calamistis</italic> + 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> three species system, 
 <italic>S. calamistis</italic> became dominant over 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B). They represented 44.80%, 31.43% and 23.77% , respectively of the total pest populations in the system. The system of the three stemborer species (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C) showed the dominance of 
 <italic>C. partellus</italic> (47.93%) followed by 
 <italic>S. calamistis</italic> (31.70%) and 
 <italic>B. fusca</italic>(20.37%), respectively. 
 <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> was the dominant species followed by 
 <italic>B. fusca</italic> and 
 <italic>S. calamistis</italic> in three pest species system (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D). In each system, the parasitoid population fluctuation evolved according to its host population fluctuation. Furthermore, the model showed that the population of each pest species in three pest species systems (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A–D) declined as compared to those in two pest species systems (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A–F). However, the average total pest populations in two-pest species systems represented only 70.07% of total average pest populations in three-pest species systems.
