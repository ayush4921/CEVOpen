<p id="Par11">In a two species system, a strong unilateral competitive interaction was revealed in the 
 <italic>C. partellus</italic> and 
 <italic>B. fusca</italic> system (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A) representing 81.18% and 18.82%, respectively of the total pest populations in the system. The population of 
 <italic>B. fusca</italic> was largely outcompeted by 
 <italic>C. partellus</italic> after 6 months and its population was drastically reduced in a two species system as compared to when it was the sole species in the system. In the system of either 
 <italic>B. fusca</italic> and 
 <italic>S. calamistis</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B) or 
 <italic>C. partellus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C), bilateral competitive interactions were strong, leading to the decline of both the species populations but without dominance. Although bilateral competitive interactions were revealed in other two multi- pest species systems, 
 <italic>C. partellus</italic> was most prevalent to 
 <italic>S. calamistis</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D) representing 66.08% and 33.92%, respectively and 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> was most prevalent to 
 <italic>B. fusca</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>E) and 
 <italic>S. calamistis</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>F) after 6 months and represented 60.53% and 39.47%, respectively of the total pest populations in the system. In addition, the model showed that the populations of each pest species in two pest species systems (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A–F) declined as compared to those in sole pest species systems (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A–D). However, the average total pest populations (population size of each pest) in sole-pest species systems represented only 85.36% of total average pest populations in two-pest species systems (population size of any given combination of two pest species). In each combination, the associated parasitoid populations proportionally varied with their respective host population fluctuation as parasitoid population tracked the peaks of the pest population.
