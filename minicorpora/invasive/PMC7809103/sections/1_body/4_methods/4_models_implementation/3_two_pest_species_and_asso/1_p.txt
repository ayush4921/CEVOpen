0: In two multi-pest species system (Fig.
1: 5A), the three previous relationships intervened for each species (Fig.
2: 5A, Loops B1, B2, and R1 for species 1 and Loops B3, B4, and R2 for species 2).
3: In addition, relationship (d: Loop R3, Fig.
4: 5A) described inter-specific competition effect of involved pest species on each other.
5: The stocks and flows diagram of each of the two species occurred with level of discrepancy between the carrying capacity ( K) and the population size, which additionally is dependent on the intra and inter-specific competition and interations among and between these species (Fig.
6: 5B).
