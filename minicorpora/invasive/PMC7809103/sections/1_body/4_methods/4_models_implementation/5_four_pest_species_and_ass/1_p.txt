0: In four multi-pest species system (Fig.
1: 7A), the relationships (a, b and c) existed for each of the four species (species 1: Loops B1, B2, and R1; species 2: Loops B3, B4, and R2; species 3: Loops B5, B6, and R3 and species 4: Loops B7, B8, and R4).
2: The relationships (f) represented by the Loops B9, B10, B11 and R5 showed interaction relationships between the four species.
3: The stocks and flows diagram obtained from the system made by four species occurred with a level of discrepancy between the carrying capacity ( K) and the population size of individual species, which additionally is dependent on the intra and inter-specific competition and interations among and between these species (Fig.
4: 7B).
