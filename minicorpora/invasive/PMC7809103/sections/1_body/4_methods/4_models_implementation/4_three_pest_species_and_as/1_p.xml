<p id="Par43">In three multi-pest species system and associated parasitoids system (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A), we have the three relationships (a, b and c) previously described for each species (Loops B1, B2, and R1 for species 1; Loops B3, B4, and R2 for species 2 and Loops B5, B6, and R3 for species 3). The relationship (e) represented the inter-specific competitive influence exercised by each of the three species on each other (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A,B7). The stocks and flows diagram of individual species in the system occurred with a level of discrepancy between the carrying capacity (
 <italic>K</italic>) and the population size, which additionally is dependent on the intra- and inter-specific competition and interations among and between these species (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B).
