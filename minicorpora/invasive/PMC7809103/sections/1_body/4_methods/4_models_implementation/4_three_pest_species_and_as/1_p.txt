0: In three multi-pest species system and associated parasitoids system (Fig.
1: 6A), we have the three relationships (a, b and c) previously described for each species (Loops B1, B2, and R1 for species 1; Loops B3, B4, and R2 for species 2 and Loops B5, B6, and R3 for species 3).
2: The relationship (e) represented the inter-specific competitive influence exercised by each of the three species on each other (Fig.
3: 6A,B7).
4: The stocks and flows diagram of individual species in the system occurred with a level of discrepancy between the carrying capacity ( K) and the population size, which additionally is dependent on the intra- and inter-specific competition and interations among and between these species (Fig.
5: 6B).
