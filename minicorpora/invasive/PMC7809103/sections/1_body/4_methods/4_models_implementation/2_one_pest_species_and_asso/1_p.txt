0: The diagram of causalities represents the basic structure of the system of a given pest species with its associated parasitoids, where arrows show the causeeffect relations.
1: A positive sign indicates direct proportionality of cause and effect, and the negative sign indicates a relation of inverse proportionality.
2: The system is characterized by two negative feedbacks (Fig.
3: 1, Loops B1 and B2) and one positive feedbacks (Fig.
4: 1A, Loop R1) leading to three main relationships: as the resource (maize plants) increases, the growth of the pest increases to occupy the available resource resulting in the pest population increase;as host availability increases, the probability that the parasitoid encounters its host increases, resulting in higher parasitism, increased host mortality rate and decreased pest population;as host mortality rate increases, parasitoid growth rate increases, and parasitoid population increases.
