 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B showed the stocks and flows diagram and auxiliary variables obtained from causal loop diagram displayed in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A. The single pest species (PSi) and associated parasitoids are the stocks in the system, representing the population size of pest species and parasitoids, respectively, at a given point in time. The growth rates represented the inflows while the decrease rates represented the outflows of the diagram. The auxiliary as well as constant variables that drive the behaviour of the system were connected using information arrows within them and to flows and stocks to represent the relations among variables in terms of equations.
