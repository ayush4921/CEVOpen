0: To develop the model, the following assumptions have been made: Data obtained under laboratory conditions were used to reproduce and simulate what may occur under field conditions.The growth of insect pest species is limited by a single maize resource, and the parasitoids only depend on their host pests for survival.During the non-cropping season, only 10% of the pest found in maize fields survived on alternative host plants and will give rise to a new pest population in maize field during the subsequent cropping season.A 3-month maize variety (Duma 43, Kenya Seed Company, Nairobi, Kenya) was considered to be used and grown from April to June and from October to December, periods corresponding to the yearly cropping seasons in Kenya.Insect pests were recorded for the first time in the maize field 1 month after planting date.Pest population growth is assumed to follow the LotkaVolterra competition function    39.
1: The parasitism level of a given pest species is recorded from the second generation of the pest, thus with an average of 2 months of delay after maize planting.The parasitism level of all parasitoid species on a given host were lumped together and no competition between parasitoid species was taken into account.Simulations were carried out assuming that each system was at the equilibrium state.
