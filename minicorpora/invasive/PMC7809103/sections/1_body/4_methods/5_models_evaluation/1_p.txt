0: The model equations used in this study are standard with LotkaVolterra like formulation.
1: These equations have been used by others authors 39,  57 to study biological species involving multiple species interactions.
2: Lack of adequate time series data did not allow to use the conventional evaluation technique that consists of plotting the observed data and simulated outputs for measuring the goodness fit of the models.
3: However, we leveraged on the popularity and enormous amount of studies produced from the famous Lotka Volterra competitive equations.
4: To measure the models performance and ensure that the obtained outputs are authentic, we compiled the population densities of all pest species (stemborers and  S. frugiperda) and parasitoids to establish an interacting system with only two species (pest and parasitoids).
5: The obtained new model was simulated, and the parasitoid-host phase diagram is presented in Fig.
6: 8.
7: The two species competition models produced circular isoclines as phase diagram, as revealed by LotkaVolterra equations therefore, we concluded the validity of the developed models using stock and flow diagram.
8: The curve of the graph is identical to shape found in literature 39,  40 and used to describe the co-evolution of two species under interactions.
