0: The models were implemented and simulated using the Vensim PLE 8.0.9 platform (Ventana Systems, Harvard, USA), which consists of a graphical environment that permits users to draw the CLD, stocks and flows diagrams and carry out simulations 55.
1: The dynamics of pest and associated parasitoids populations were considered as stocks and the in/out flows were defined.
2: The inflows were composed of pest or parasitoid population growth rates while the outflows were represented by decrease rates of the pests that have been parasitized or the parasitoids that have completed their life cycle.
