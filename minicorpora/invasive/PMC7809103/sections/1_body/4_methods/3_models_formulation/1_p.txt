0: Ordinary differential equation developed to study species population dynamics under competitions were used in this study.
1: All the models used have the generic formulation displayed in Eq.
2: ( 2).
3: Considering  N( t) as a state variable to denote the insect population abundance at time  t; the population growth for the  ith species is defined with the LotkaVolterra competition equations, which was later modified by MacArthur and Levins 54 as: 2\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\frac{{dN_{i} }}{dt} = \frac{{r_{i} N_{i} }}{{K_{i} }}\left( {K_{i} - N_{i} - \mathop \sum \limits_{j \ne i}^{m} a_{ij} N_{j} } \right)$$\end{document}dNidt=riNiKiKi-Ni-j=imaijNjwhere the  Ni is the species abundance,  ri is the intrinsic rate of population natural increase,  Ki is the species carrying capacity (the maximum attainable population size),  m is the number of pest species in the system, and  aij is the effect that an individual species characterized by  jth can cause to another species characterized with  ith.
4: The translation of this generic mathematical expression was applied to formulate the equations used to simulate each case studied.
5: The model expressions can be found in Supplementary  Appendix.
