 <italic>B. fusca</italic> + 
 <italic>S. calamistis</italic> and 
 <italic>C. partellus</italic> + 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> two-species systems where both species populations fluctuate and dropped considerably. Those behaviours may be explained by the overlapped ecological niches of these pest species. The females of 
 <italic>B. fusca</italic> and 
 <italic>S. calamistis</italic> deposit the eggs between the leaf sheath and the stem of plant, whereas 
 <italic>C. partellus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> deposit eggs directly on leaf surfaces

 <italic>B. fusca</italic> or
