 <p id="Par1">Root-knot nematodes (RKN), 
  <italic>Meloidogyne</italic> spp., are important crop pests that cause severe losses in crop production worldwide, reducing both productivity and crop quality. 
  <italic>Meloidogyne chitwoodi</italic> Golden, O'Bannon, Santo &amp; Finley, 1980 is considered a quarantine organism by the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO) causing damage in tomato and potato crops. The development of nonchemical and sustainable management strategies to reduce nematode damage is crucial. The resistance of 
  <italic>Solanum linnaeanum</italic> Hepper &amp; P.-M.L. Jaeger and 
  <italic>S. sisymbriifolium</italic> Lamarck cv. Sis 6001 to 
  <italic>M. chitwoodi</italic> was evaluated based on gall index (GI), the Bridge &amp; Page (1980) rating chart and reproduction factor (RF). Both plant species were resistant to 
  <italic>M. chitwoodi</italic>. 
  <italic>Solanum linnaeanum</italic> had an average of 519 small root swellings/plant, with 45% adult nematodes inside the roots, all males. 
  <italic>Solanum sisymbriifolium</italic> had GI ≤ 2 and RF ≤ 1 with a high percentage (69%) of nematodes inside the roots that did not develop beyond the sexually undifferentiated second-stage. The use of 
  <italic>S. linnaeanum</italic> as a new source of resistance is a good alternative for the control of RKN in the quest to develop nonchemical and sustainable management strategies to protect crops.
