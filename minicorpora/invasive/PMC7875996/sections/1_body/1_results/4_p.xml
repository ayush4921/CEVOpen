 </sup> was 0, because no egg masses developed on the roots. Observation of the stained root systems showed the presence of many small root swellings (average of the 10 replicates was 519 small root swellings/plant) and nematodes inside the roots (total numbers values between 329 and 883 per plant) (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Almost all the nematodes inside the roots were second-stage juveniles (J
