 </sup>. However, when plants were analyzed separately some variability could be observed between them. Only two replicates (in a total of 10 replicates, 5 per assay) showed the presence of galls, one with one gall and without egg masses and another with 11 galls with 9 egg masses containing 187 eggs in total (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Despite this, there are no statistically significant differences between numbers of galls, egg masses, eggs and RF between 
 <italic>S. linnaeanum</italic> and 
 <italic>S. sisymbriifolium</italic> cv. Sis 6001. Observation of stained roots of 
 <italic>S. sisymbriifolium</italic> cv. Sis 6001 showed some nematodes (total numbers values between 4 and 117 per plant) (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). The majority of nematodes inside the roots were J
 <sub>2</sub> (69%); of the remainder, 17% were adults, of which 63% were males (Fig.
