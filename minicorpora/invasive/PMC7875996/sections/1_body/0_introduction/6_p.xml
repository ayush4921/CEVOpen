 <italic>Solanum sisymbriifolium,</italic> originates from warm, temperate South America, is an annual or perennial erect, rhizomatous, shrubby weed with an extensive root system and spiny leaves, currently distributed throughout the world and invasive in some countries. Interest in the study of this plant has increased since it was proved to be a good trap crop against potato cyst nematodes (PCN), 
 <italic>Globodera</italic> spp. It was introduced in The Netherlands following research that identified the species as the most suitable candidate among a diversity of species tested as potential trap crops
