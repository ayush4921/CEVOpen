0: The main goals of the present study were: to evaluate the potential value of two wild  Solanum plants,  S. linnaeanum and  S. sisymbriifolium, in controlling agricultural pests such as RKN; to assist in the development of sustainable and ecofriendly management methods of key enemies in agriculture, in order to reduce dependence on chemical pesticides; and to improve crop productivity.
1: The resistance shown by  S. linnaeanum and  S. sisymbriifolium cv.
2: Sis 6001 was evaluated against  M. chitwoodi.
3: Although some studies have been made with  S. sisymbriifolium and PPN and it is already used as a trap crop in some places, not much is known about  S. linnaeanum and its effects on nematodes.
4: New sources of resistance may result in the development of sustainable and nonchemical management strategies to protect crops against PPN.
5: This is the first report of  S. linnaeanum being used in Portugal for the management of PPN.
