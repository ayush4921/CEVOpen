 </sup>. Despite the fact that the use of chemical pesticides is an effective control strategy, this is an expensive method and European legislation (Directive 69/465/CEE; Directive 2009/128/EC) is very strict regarding the use of nematicides in the field, focusing mainly on environmental safety issues and health risks. The increase of environmental concerns and regulatory restrictions on the application of chemical products in conventional systems have meant that the use of plant resistance to control PPN has increased. The most effective, environmentally friendly, and economical means of controlling
