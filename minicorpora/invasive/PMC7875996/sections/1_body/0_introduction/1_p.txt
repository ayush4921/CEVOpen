0: Plant-parasitic nematodes (PPN) are a focus of intense scientific research because they represent an important constraint for global food production, reducing yields and crop quality worldwide 1  4.
1: Most agricultural fields are infested with at least one PPN species and annual crop losses caused by them are estimated to be between 8.8 and 14.6% of total World crop production 5,  6.
2: The nematodes with the greatest economic impact are the root-knot nematodes (RKN),  Meloidogyne spp.
3: Many species of this genus are quite aggressive, and they are widely distributed across a range of climatic conditions 3,  7,  8.
4: Some species are considered quarantine pests by the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO) and interfere with international trade 9.
