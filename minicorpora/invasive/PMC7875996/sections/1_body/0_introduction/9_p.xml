<p id="Par10">The main goals of the present study were: to evaluate the potential value of two wild 
 <italic>Solanum</italic> plants, 
 <italic>S. linnaeanum</italic> and 
 <italic>S. sisymbriifolium</italic>, in controlling agricultural pests such as RKN; to assist in the development of sustainable and ecofriendly management methods of key enemies in agriculture, in order to reduce dependence on chemical pesticides; and to improve crop productivity. The resistance shown by 
 <italic>S. linnaeanum</italic> and 
 <italic>S. sisymbriifolium</italic> cv. Sis 6001 was evaluated against 
 <italic>M. chitwoodi</italic>. Although some studies have been made with 
 <italic>S. sisymbriifolium</italic> and PPN and it is already used as a trap crop in some places, not much is known about 
 <italic>S. linnaeanum</italic> and its effects on nematodes. New sources of resistance may result in the development of sustainable and nonchemical management strategies to protect crops against PPN. This is the first report of 
 <italic>S. linnaeanum</italic> being used in Portugal for the management of PPN.
