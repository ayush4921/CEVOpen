0: The global distribution and wide range of hosts of RKN explains the high economic impact of these nematodes and the difficulties found in their management 11.
1: Although RKN are impossible to eradicate, it is crucial to reduce the amount of damage they cause if productivity is to be sustainable 5.
2: Their control is mainly achieved by the cultural practices of crop rotation and the use of resistant cultivars, combined with nematicide application 15,  16.
3: Despite the fact that the use of chemical pesticides is an effective control strategy, this is an expensive method and European legislation (Directive 69/465/CEE; Directive 2009/128/EC) is very strict regarding the use of nematicides in the field, focusing mainly on environmental safety issues and health risks.
4: The increase of environmental concerns and regulatory restrictions on the application of chemical products in conventional systems have meant that the use of plant resistance to control PPN has increased.
5: The most effective, environmentally friendly, and economical means of controlling  Meloidogyne spp.
6: is the use of resistant cultivars 10.
7: However, up to now, there are no potato cultivars resistant to RKN 9.
