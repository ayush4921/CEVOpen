 <italic>Solanum linnaeanum</italic> exhibits resistance to Verticillium wilt and Liu and collaborators (2015) succeeded in the transference of this resistance to eggplants through the introgression of the disease resistance gene

 <italic>S. linnaeanum</italic> and 
 <italic>S. sisymbriifolium</italic> resistance genes are isolated, they can be used to confer resistance to plants susceptible to 
 <italic>M. chitwoodi</italic>, such as tomato and potato plants. They have a potential to be used as sources for resistance to
