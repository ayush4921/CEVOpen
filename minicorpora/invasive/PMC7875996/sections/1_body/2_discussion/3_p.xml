 </sup>. So far, the capacity of J
 <sub>2</sub> penetration into the roots has not been considered as a mechanism for characterization of the resistance. Generally, resistance to nematodes in plants becomes obvious after J
 <sub>2</sub> penetration into the roots (i.e. post-infection)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>
 </sup>. The J
 <sub>2</sub> that penetrate the roots of resistant plants may die or leave the roots, but they can also develop to the adult stage, as females without egg production (or the eggs produced are not viable) or as males
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>
 </sup>. Various procedures for determining the resistance of plants to nematodes are used. The most common procedures are the percentage or number of galls or egg masses formed as well as the RF (Pf/Pi) values

 </sup>. The low numbers of nematodes that penetrated the roots of 
 <italic>S. linnaeanum</italic> and 
 <italic>S. sisymbriifolium</italic> cv. Sis 6001 are probably due to substances produced by the roots of these plants, which prevented their penetration. Conceição and collaborators (2012) analyzed the effects of 
 <italic>S. sisymbriifolium</italic> (cvs. Domino, Pion, Sharp and Sis 4004) exudates in five 
 <italic>Meloidogyne</italic> isolates (
 <italic>M. arenaria</italic>, 
 <italic>M. chitwoodi</italic>, 
 <italic>M. hapla</italic>, 
 <italic>M. hispanica</italic> and 
 <italic>M. javanica</italic>) and showed the complexity and variability of the interactions between RKN and 
 <italic>S. sisymbriifolium</italic>
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>
 </sup>. In this study, the cultivars studied demonstrated low or no inhibitory effect on 
 <italic>M. chitwoodi</italic> hatching. The presence of resistance in some 
 <italic>S. sisymbriifolium</italic> cultivars to PPN, has already been demonstrated for 
 <italic>G. pallida</italic>, 
 <italic>G. rostochiensis</italic>, 
 <italic>M. chitwoodi</italic> and 
 <italic>M. javanica</italic>
 <sup>

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>
 </sup>. This was confirmed by Hajihassani et al. (2020) for other major species of RKN (
 <italic>M. arenaria</italic>, 
 <italic>M. haplanaria</italic> and 
 <italic>M. incognita</italic>), although the effectiveness of resistance to 
 <italic>M. arenaria</italic> varied a lot between 
 <italic>S. sisymbriifolium</italic> cultivars
