<p id="Par17">The time that any 
 <italic>Meloidogyne</italic> species needs to complete a generation depends on external factors, such as temperature, humidity, light and the quality and condition of the host plant in relation to its age and nutritional status. All of these factors are crucial as they determine how and when the effects of nematodes on the plant will be most visible

 </sup>. In our laboratory, it was observed that 
 <italic>M. chitwoodi</italic> had a slower rate of development than other 
 <italic>Meloidogyne</italic> isolates. Thus, the plants were uprooted 70Â days after inoculation (DAI) instead of the usual 60 DAI. Any differences found between species or replicates can only be attributed to characteristics inherent to the plants as the assay conditions were always the same.
