 <italic>S. linnaeanum</italic>, in the present work, there was greater nematode penetration of the roots than in 
 <italic>S. sisymbriifolium</italic> cv. Sis 6001, but there was no reproduction in any of the plants, and all nematodes that developed into adults were males. This reaction is a form of active resistance (i.e. post-infection) in which, although the J

Adverse nutrition conditions in younger stages can, by themselves, change the physiology of certain nematodes, eliminating formation of females, egg production or population increase

 </sup>. The larger number of males in the roots may indicate that the plant has a type of resistance that prevents the nematode from feeding normally.
