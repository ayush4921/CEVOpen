 <italic>S. linnaeanum</italic> may be a better plant to use against nematodes. It already exists in Portugal and is also a source of resistance to other pests and plant diseases such as Verticillium wilt

 <italic>Meloidogyne</italic> species considered and with the plants of 
 <italic>S. linnaeanum</italic> used. Tzortzakakis and collaborators (2006) tested 
 <italic>S. linnaeanum</italic> against 
 <italic>M. incognita</italic> and 
 <italic>M. javanica</italic> and, in both cases, the nematodes reproduced, although in 
 <italic>M. incognita</italic> the numbers of galls and egg masses were significantly lower than in the controls
