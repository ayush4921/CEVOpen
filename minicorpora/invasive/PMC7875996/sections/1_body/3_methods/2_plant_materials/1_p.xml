 <italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> cv. Coração de boi (tomato), 
 <italic>S. linnaeanum</italic> and 
 <italic>S. sisymbriifolium</italic> cv. Sis 6001 were grown from seeds. Our stock of 
 <italic>S. linnaeanum</italic> is a wild isolate whose seeds were harvested from a plant growing on the roadside in the Algarve. The seeds were germinated at 25–27 °C on moist filter paper in Petri dishes and transplanted singly into 5 cm diameter plastic pots containing 60 cm
 <sup>3</sup> of a steam-sterilized mixture of loam soil and sand (1:2 v/v). 
 <italic>Solanum sisymbriifolium</italic> seeds were germinated in a glasshouse in polystyrene plates containing sterile peat. Fifteen days after germination the seedlings of this species were transplanted singly into pots filled with 500 g of steam-sterilized soil mix (sand:soil:peat 1:1:1 v/v). The potato plants, 
 <italic>S. tuberosum</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>tuberosum</italic> L. (cv. Désirée), were obtained from pieces of potato tubers with sprouts in pots with the same mixture of soil (sand:soil:peat 1:1:1 v/v). All plants were kept in a glasshouse under the same conditions as described above.
