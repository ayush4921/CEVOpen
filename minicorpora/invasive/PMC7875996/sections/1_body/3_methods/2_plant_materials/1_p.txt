5: Solanum sisymbriifolium seeds were germinated in a glasshouse in polystyrene plates containing sterile peat.
6: Fifteen days after germination the seedlings of this species were transplanted singly into pots filled with 500 g of steam-sterilized soil mix (sand:soil:peat 1:1:1 v/v).
7: The potato plants,  S. tuberosum ssp.
8: tuberosum L. (cv.
