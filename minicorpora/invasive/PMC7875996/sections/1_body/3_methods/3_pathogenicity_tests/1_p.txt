0: Five four-weeks-old plants from each species were inoculated with 5000 M .
1: chitwoodi eggs (initial population density, Pi).
2: To confirm the soil sterility one plant of each species was potted in the sterilized soil mix and not inoculated.
3: Five susceptible tomato plants cv.
4: Coracao de boi and five susceptible potato plants cv.
5: Desiree were also inoculated to confirm the viability of the inocula.
6: Pots were kept in the conditions already mentioned and the plants were watered daily.
7: Seventy DAI the plants were uprooted and the root systems washed.
8: The root systems were stained with phloxine B (0.0015% solution) for 15 min 52, and galls and eggs masses were counted.
9: Eggs were extracted as described above and counted to determine the final population (Pf).
10: Resistance rating of the species were based on Gall Index (GI) and Reproduction Factor (RF = Pf / Pi), according to the modified quantitative scheme of Canto-Saenz (1985) 41,  53.
11: The evaluation of the degree of resistance of the plants was based on GI and RF 37.
