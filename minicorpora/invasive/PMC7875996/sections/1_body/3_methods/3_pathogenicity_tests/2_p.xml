 <italic>M. chitwoodi</italic> were recorded. Resistance ratings of these plants were based on the RKN rating chart of Bridge &amp; Page (1980)

 </sup>. This scale is based on the percentage and types of roots galled from 0 (0%, no galls) to 10 (100% galled). The roots were observed using a routine stereo microscope Leica M80, at a magnification of 60 x, and the nematodes found were transferred onto a glass slide and observed with an optical microscope Leica DM2500, at a magnification of 400 ×. The identification of the different developmental stages was done by comparing their morphological characteristics with those described for 
 <italic>M. incognita</italic> (Supplementary Fig.
