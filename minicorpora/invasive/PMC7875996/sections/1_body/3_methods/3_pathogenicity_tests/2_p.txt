0: Roots that had less than 100 egg masses were stained with acid fuchsin 54, and the numbers of the different developmental stages of  M. chitwoodi were recorded.
1: Resistance ratings of these plants were based on the RKN rating chart of Bridge & Page (1980) 36.
2: This scale is based on the percentage and types of roots galled from 0 (0%, no galls) to 10 (100% galled).
3: The roots were observed using a routine stereo microscope Leica M80, at a magnification of 60 x, and the nematodes found were transferred onto a glass slide and observed with an optical microscope Leica DM2500, at a magnification of 400 .
4: The identification of the different developmental stages was done by comparing their morphological characteristics with those described for  M. incognita (Supplementary Fig.
5: S2) 41,  55.
