<p id="Par26">Five four-weeks-old plants from each species were inoculated with 5000 M
 <italic>. chitwoodi</italic> eggs (initial population density, Pi). To confirm the soil sterility one plant of each species was potted in the sterilized soil mix and not inoculated. Five susceptible tomato plants cv. Coração de boi and five susceptible potato plants cv. Désirée were also inoculated to confirm the viability of the inocula. Pots were kept in the conditions already mentioned and the plants were watered daily. Seventy DAI the plants were uprooted and the root systems washed. The root systems were stained with phloxine B (0.0015% solution) for 15 min

Resistance rating of the species were based on Gall Index (GI) and Reproduction Factor (RF = Pf / Pi), according to the modified quantitative scheme of Canto-Sáenz (1985)
