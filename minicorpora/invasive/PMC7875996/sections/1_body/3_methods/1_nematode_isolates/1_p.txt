0: Meloidogyne chitwoodi was chosen because it is a problem for potato crops that has already been detected in Portugal and is considered an A2 quarantine pest by EPPO.
1: An isolate of  M. chitwoodi from the NEMATO-lab of the University of Coimbra, obtained from a potato field in Porto, Portugal 49, was maintained and multiplied on susceptible tomato plants,  S. lycopersicum cv.
2: Coracao de boi, inoculated with 15 egg masses/plant.
3: The plants were grown in pots filled with 500 g of steam-sterilized soil mix (sand:soil:peat 1:1:1 v/v) and kept in a glasshouse (2025 C, 7075% relative humidity and 12 h photoperiod).
4: Ninety DAI, the plants were uprooted and nematode eggs were extracted with 0.52% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) solution, according to Hussey & Barker (1973) 50.
5: This culture of  M. chitwoodi is a pure isolate started initially from a single egg mass; its identification was confirmed by esterase phenotype analysis at the beginning and at the end of each assay 51.
