 <italic>Meloidogyne chitwoodi</italic> was chosen because it is a problem for potato crops that has already been detected in Portugal and is considered an A2 quarantine pest by EPPO. An isolate of 
 <italic>M. chitwoodi</italic> from the NEMATO-lab of the University of Coimbra, obtained from a potato field in Porto, Portugal

 <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic> cv. Coração de boi, inoculated with 15 egg masses/plant. The plants were grown in pots filled with 500 g of steam-sterilized soil mix (sand:soil:peat 1:1:1 v/v) and kept in a glasshouse (20–25 °C, 70–75% relative humidity and 12 h photoperiod). Ninety DAI, the plants were uprooted and nematode eggs were extracted with 0.52% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) solution, according to Hussey &amp; Barker (1973)
