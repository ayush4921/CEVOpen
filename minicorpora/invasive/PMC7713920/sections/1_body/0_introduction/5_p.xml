<p>Here, we tested how interactions between native 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> and invasive 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> vines in China impact on the performance of each species. Specifically, we measured germination, seedling growth, phytochemical effects, and competitive interactions between these two vines. Our aim was to determine whether 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> can outperform 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> through priority effects (via the timing of germination and seedling growth) and high competitiveness (via phytochemical effects and competitive ability), and therefore whether this it is a promising species for ecological restoration in areas previously invaded by 
 <italic>Mikania</italic>.
