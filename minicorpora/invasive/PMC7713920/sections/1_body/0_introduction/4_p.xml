<p>From a restoration viewpoint, biotic resistance and resource pre‐emption also suggest that selecting native plants with low niche differentiation, but with higher competitive ability, from the most common invasive species, may enhance restoration success following the clearing of invasive species (Funk et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36938-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>; Roberts et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36938-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Young et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36938-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). However, native species used in restoration are often selected with limited ecological background, especially with regard to species interactions. Native species selection can also be difficult in habitats where no information is available on the original or “pristine” state of communities (Ostertag et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36938-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). In China, we observed the native leguminous vine, 
 <italic>Pueraria lobata</italic> (Willd) Ohwi, and its cultivar 
 <italic>Pueraria lobata</italic> var. 
 <italic>thomsonii</italic> Benth Vaniot der Maesen (hereafter collectively referred to as 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic>), to often co‐occur with the highly invasive vine, 
 <italic>Mikania micrantha</italic> H. B. K. (hereafter referred to as 
 <italic>Mikania</italic>). We also observed 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> seedlings to be generally taller than 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> seedlings in the field, presumably because 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> seeds germinate earlier than 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> seeds. 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> is widely distributed from South‐East Asia to Australia, and it has vigorous growth (up to 26 cm per day or 15 m per growing season), with new roots being produced wherever nodes make contact with soil (EPPO, 
 <xref rid="ece36938-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">1997</xref>). 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> is also frequently used to improve soil because of its ability to fix nitrogen through rhizobium symbiosis (Li et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36938-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>), making it a promising candidate for restoration.
