0: Competitionbased biotic resistance has been touted as an important mechanism to explain plant invasion success (Byun & Lee,  2017; MacDougall et al.,  2009).
1: Speciesrich communities will utilize resources more completely than speciespoor communities (Dimitrakopoulos & Schmid,  2004; SchererLorenzen et al.,  2003), thereby limiting the resources available to new arrivals (Fargione et al.,  2003; Hector et al.,  2001).
2: Under these circumstances, only highly competitive nonnative species may establish and become invasive.
3: Speciespoor communities, for example, in recently disturbed habitats, may also repel invasive species if resident native species are strong competitors.
4: Mwangi et al.
5: 's ( 2007) found such resource preemption to resist invasion during the early stages of succession.
6: These authors showed that native species capable of earlier establishment, and that had faster growth rates, than nonnative species, preempted resources, thereby negatively affecting slowergrowing nonnative species (Mwangi et al.,  2007).
7: These observations question the supposed link between high species richness and biotic resistance and suggest that resource preemption, via priority effects and strong competition, may resist invasion, even in speciespoor communities.
