<p>Competition‐based biotic resistance has been touted as an important mechanism to explain plant invasion success (Byun &amp; Lee, 
 <xref rid="ece36938-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; MacDougall et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36938-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). Species‐rich communities will utilize resources more completely than species‐poor communities (Dimitrakopoulos &amp; Schmid, 
 <xref rid="ece36938-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>; Scherer‐Lorenzen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36938-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>), thereby limiting the resources available to new arrivals (Fargione et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36938-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>; Hector et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36938-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>). Under these circumstances, only highly competitive non‐native species may establish and become invasive. Species‐poor communities, for example, in recently disturbed habitats, may also repel invasive species if resident native species are strong competitors. Mwangi et al.'s (
 <xref rid="ece36938-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>) found such resource “pre‐emption” to resist invasion during the early stages of succession. These authors showed that native species capable of earlier establishment, and that had faster growth rates, than non‐native species, pre‐empted resources, thereby negatively affecting slower‐growing non‐native species (Mwangi et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36938-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). These observations question the supposed link between high species richness and biotic resistance and suggest that resource pre‐emption, via priority effects and strong competition, may resist invasion, even in species‐poor communities.
