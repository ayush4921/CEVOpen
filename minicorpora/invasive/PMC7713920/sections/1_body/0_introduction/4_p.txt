0: From a restoration viewpoint, biotic resistance and resource preemption also suggest that selecting native plants with low niche differentiation, but with higher competitive ability, from the most common invasive species, may enhance restoration success following the clearing of invasive species (Funk et al.,  2008; Roberts et al.,  2010; Young et al.,  2005).
1: However, native species used in restoration are often selected with limited ecological background, especially with regard to species interactions.
2: Native species selection can also be difficult in habitats where no information is available on the original or pristine state of communities (Ostertag et al.,  2015).
3: In China, we observed the native leguminous vine,  Pueraria lobata (Willd) Ohwi, and its cultivar  Pueraria lobata var.
4: thomsonii Benth Vaniot der Maesen (hereafter collectively referred to as  Pueraria), to often cooccur with the highly invasive vine,  Mikania micrantha H. B. K. (hereafter referred to as  Mikania).
5: We also observed  Pueraria seedlings to be generally taller than  Mikania seedlings in the field, presumably because  Pueraria seeds germinate earlier than  Mikania seeds.
6: Pueraria is widely distributed from SouthEast Asia to Australia, and it has vigorous growth (up to 26 cm per day or 15 m per growing season), with new roots being produced wherever nodes make contact with soil (EPPO,  1997).
7: Pueraria is also frequently used to improve soil because of its ability to fix nitrogen through rhizobium symbiosis (Li et al.,  2015), making it a promising candidate for restoration.
