0: Invasive plants pose significant threats to biodiversity, ecosystem services, regional economies, and public health (CastroDiez et al.,  2016; Ricciardi et al.,  2017; Simberloff,  2005).
1: What makes some species invasive and others not remains an open question in ecology.
2: This reflects the high context dependency of biological invasions.
3: That is, species traits interact in complex ways with conditions in the new environment to determine the outcome of nonnative species introductions.
4: These uncertainties also suggest that habitatspecific approaches are needed to effectively manage invasive populations (Tang et al.,  2013).
