0: All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 18.0 software (SPSS Inc.).
1: Plant performance variables, gas exchange parameters, the fluorescence variables, and soil nitrogen indices between were compared between treatments using oneway ANOVAs, followed by Duncan post hoc tests at  p < .05.
2: For germination rates and germination index analyses, significant differences under light and dark conditions were determined using  t tests for two independent samples.
3: We used linear regression to assess the response of total biomass and seedling height to planting time.
4: Moreover, for total biomass and seedling height, significant differences between  Pueraria and  Mikania were determined using  t tests for two independent samples in each stage throughout the growth period.
5: General linear models were used to assess the effects of time and plant species as well as their interaction on total biomass and plant height during seedling growth period, and the effects of  Mikania removal and sowing density of  Pueraria seeds, as well as their interaction, on  Mikania and  Pueraria biomass under field conditions.
6: The SigmaPlot 12.0 software was used to visualize data.
