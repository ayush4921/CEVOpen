0: Twentyfour 2 m  2 m plots, separated by at least 50 cm, were established at the study site.
1: All aboveground vegetation and most roots were removed in 12 plots to mimic  Mikania control and removal.
2: The remaining 12 plots were left untouched.
3: Four sowing densities of  Pueraria (0, 100, 200, and 400 grains/m 2) were each replicated in three cleared and three uncleared plots.
4: All seeds were treated with H 2SO 4 and sown after radicle emergence.
5: Pueraria and  Mikania plants in each plot were harvested six months after sowing and fresh aboveground biomass (stem + leaf material) determined for each species.
6: Samples were also ovendried to determine dry weight.
