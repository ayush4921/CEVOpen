0: After 120 days of growth, three mature leaves of the same orientation (middle and upper leaves) from five plants of each treatment were selected and gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence measured.
1: The net photosynthetic rate ( Pn) and transpiration rate ( Tr) were measured using a portable infrared gas analyzer Li6400 (LICOR, Inc.) at a photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 800 mol m 2 s 1.
2: At the same time, the maximum photochemical efficiency  Fv/ Fm, the effective quantum yield (Yield), and the electron transport rate (ETR) were measured at actual light intensity using a portable pulsemodulated fluorometer (PAM2100, Walz, Effeltrich).
3: Finally, water use efficiency (WUE =  Pn/ Tr) and Rubisco content (Rubisco [g/m 2] = ETR  0.014) were estimated (Evans & Poorter,  2001).
