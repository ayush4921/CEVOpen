<p>After 120 days of growth, three mature leaves of the same orientation (middle and upper leaves) from five plants of each treatment were selected and gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence measured. The net photosynthetic rate (
 <italic>Pn</italic>) and transpiration rate (
 <italic>Tr</italic>) were measured using a portable infrared gas analyzer Li‐6400 (LI‐COR, Inc.) at a photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 800 μmol m
 <sup>−2</sup> s
 <sup>−1</sup>. At the same time, the maximum photochemical efficiency

 <italic>Fm</italic>, the effective quantum yield (Yield), and the electron transport rate (ETR) were measured at actual light intensity using a portable pulse‐modulated fluorometer (PAM‐2100, Walz, Effeltrich). Finally, water use efficiency (WUE = 
 <italic>Pn</italic>/
 <italic>Tr</italic>) and Rubisco content (Rubisco [g/m
 <sup>2</sup>] = ETR × 0.014) were estimated (Evans &amp; Poorter,
