0: Interspecific competition may change soil nutrient levels.
1: Since  Pueraria is a legume, it can elevate soil nitrogen availability through symbiosis with nitrogenfixing rhizobium.
2: This may also result in changes in soil microbial biomass nitrogen.
3: We compared soil nitrogen and the soil microbial biomass nitrogen between  Pueraria and  Mikania.
4: For each species, plants from five pots (grown in monoculture) were excavated and rhizosphere soils collected after 120 days of growth.
5: Total nitrogen content of these soils was determined using the Kjeldahl method (airdried soil passed through a 0.15mm sieve), while levels of  NH4+ and  NO3 were measured in fresh soil (passed through a 1mm sieve) by continuous flow analyzer (Proxima, Alliance Instruments).
6: Soil microbial biomass nitrogen was measured using a chloroform fumigation method (Jenkinson & Powlson,  1976).
