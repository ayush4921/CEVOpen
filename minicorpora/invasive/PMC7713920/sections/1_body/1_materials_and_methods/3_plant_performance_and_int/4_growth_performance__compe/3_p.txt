0: We calculated the relative interaction index (RII) (Armas et al.,  2004; Domenech & Vila,  2008; Li et al.,  2015) to estimate the intensity of competition as RII = ( Bw   Bo)/( Bw +  Bo), where  Bw is the individual biomass of the target plant when growing with another plant (i.e., under interspecific competition), and  Bo is the individual biomass of the target plant when growing by itself (i.e., under intraspecific competition) after 120 days.
1: RII has value range from 1 to +1, with negative values indicating competition (i.e., growth of the target species is reduced) while positive values indicate facilitation (i.e., growth of the target species is promoted).
