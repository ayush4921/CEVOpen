<p>To assess the competitive interactions between 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> and 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic>, healthy seedlings of both species with identical growth and developmental stages were selected and transplanted in outdoor pots (18–28 cm in diameter, 21 cm in height). Surface soil (0–20 cm) in the biological garden of South China Normal University was collected and used as growth medium. The soil was broken up and mixed with appropriate amount of river sand and organic fertilizer to improve gas permeability and fertility. Planting arrangements included 
 <italic>Mikania</italic>:
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> ratios of 4:0 (4M), 3:1 (3M1P), 2:2 (2M2P), 1:3 (1M3P), and 0:4 (4P); that is, each pot contained four seedlings. Each planting arrangement was replicated 15 times. All pots were put at a naturally lit experimental site in the biological garden, received equal amounts of nutrients and water, and were randomized every three days.
