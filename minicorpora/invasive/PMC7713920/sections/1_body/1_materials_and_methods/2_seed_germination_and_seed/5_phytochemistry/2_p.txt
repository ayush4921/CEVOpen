0: Allelopathy is an important mechanism of interspecific competition between plants, whereby phytochemicals released by one species inhibit the growth of another species (Rice,  1984).
1: In order to compare the allelopathic potential of  Pueraria and  Mikania, a bioassay of aqueous phytochemical extracts on seed germination was carried out in a reciprocal experiment.
2: Fresh stems and leaves of both species were collected from the biological garden in South China Normal University (238N, 11320E).
3: These were soaked in distilled water at room temperature for 48 hr.
4: Extracts were diluted to obtain high (0.05 g/ml) and low (0.025 g/ml) phytochemical concentrations, while distilled water was used in control treatments.
5: Fifteen milliliters of aqueous plant extract was added to a petri dish containing 50 seeds of the target species and kept in an incubator (RXZ Intelligent, Ningbo Jiangnan Instrument Factory) set at full illumination and darkness for 12 hr at 30 and 27C day/night temperature, respectively, and a constant humidity of 65%.
6: Each treatment was replicated five times.
7: Moisture for each petri dish was maintained by adding equal amounts of treatmentspecific solution in subsequent days.
8: Seedlings were photographed after 10 days to measure root length and seedling height using ImageJ software (ImageJ2x).
9: Germination rate and germination indices were calculated as discussed above.
10: The response index (RI) and synthetical effects (SE) provide more direct and accurate comparison for phytochemical effects between species (Williamson & Richardson,  1988).
11: Response index was calculated as RI = ( T/ C)  1, and synthetical effects (SE) as the average value of RI (Ma et al.,  2006), where  T is the treatment value,  C is the control value.
12: When  T >  C, RI > 0, it indicates the promoting effect; when  T <  C, RI < 0, it indicates the inhibiting effect, and the absolute value of RI represents the allelopathy intensity.
