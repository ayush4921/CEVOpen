0: Photosensitivity of seed germination has a significant effect on the survival and establishment of plants (FinchSavage & LeubnerMetzger,  2006).
1: It was previously reported that  Mikania seeds do not germinate easily under dark conditions and that the soil seed bank of this species produces very few seedlings in the absence of light (Li et al.,  2002).
2: Whether seed germination of  Pueraria is dependent on the light is not clear.
3: We designed an experiment to test to what extend light influences the germination of  Pueraria and  Mikania seeds.
