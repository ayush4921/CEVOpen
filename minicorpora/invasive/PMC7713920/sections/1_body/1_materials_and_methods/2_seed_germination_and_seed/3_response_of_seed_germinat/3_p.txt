0: Fifty sterilized  Mikania seeds and 50 sterilized as well as 50 H 2SO 4treated seeds of  Pueraria were put in a petri dish containing two layers of moist filter.
1: Each seed type was replicated five times ( n total = 30).
2: Petri dishes were placed in incubators (RXZ Intelligent Type, Ningbo Jiangnan Instrument Factory, China) and subjected to one of two incubation conditions: (a) full illumination and darkness for 12 hr, at 30 and 27C, day/night temperature, respectively; (b) darkness for 24 hr (30/27C, day/night temperature).
3: Humidity was maintained at 65% throughout the experiment.
4: The number of germinated seeds was counted daily at 24 hr of intervals over a 14day period.
5: We considered the emergence of radicles (>1 mm) from the seed coat as an indicator for successful germination.
6: Finally, germination rate (GR) and germination index (GI) (Javaid & Tanveer,  2014) were calculated as follows:  GR=(Numberofgerminatedseeds/Totalnumberoftestedseeds)100%GI=(Gt/Dt)(GtNumberofgerminatedseedondayt,Dtdayt).
