 <sub>4</sub>‐treated seeds of 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> were evenly sown in a pot (diameter: 12–19 cm, height: 15 cm) filled with nutrient‐rich soils. Each seed lot planting was replicated five times. Pots were covered with plastic film and kept in an artificial climate incubator (RXZ Intelligent, Ningbo Jiangnan Instrument Factory) set for full illumination and darkness for 12 hr each, and 30 and 27°C, day/night temperature, respectively, with 65% humidity. Once emerging seedlings broke the soil surface, the plastic film was removed and pots moved to the glasshouse located at the School of Life Sciences, South China Normal University. During the growth period, seedlings were thinned out to make sure that equal numbers of seedlings remained in all pots. Pots were watered every day and were randomized weekly. Plant height, number of leaves, and total biomass from five plants of each pot were measured every 15 days, and plants were harvested after 60 days of growth. Total biomass was calculated after drying plant material for at least 48 hr at 65°C in an oven.
