<p>Results from general linear models showed that removal, sowing density, and their interaction had a significant effect on above‐ground biomass of both 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> and 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic>. The effect of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> removal treatments was higher than that of sowing density on biomass of both vine species, whereas the removal of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> had a lower impact on 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> than 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> performance (Table
