<p>Following clearing and sowing of 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> seeds in the field, we found that the regeneration of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> declined dramatically after six months (by −79.8%, −92.0% and −84.3%, at sowing densities of 100, 200, and 400 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> seeds/m
 <sup>2</sup>, respectively) compared to the control sites. 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> biomass increased significantly with increased sowing density (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36938-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>). Similar trends were observed when 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> seeds were sown in soils without the removal of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic>. Although not as dramatic, the regeneration of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> significantly decreased by up to 55.0% when 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> was sown at a density of 400 seeds/m
 <sup>2</sup> (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36938-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>). 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> regeneration was lowest in plots where 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> was removed and when 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> sowing density was 200 seeds/m
 <sup>2</sup>, while regeneration decreased significantly under a sowing density of 400 seeds/m
 <sup>2</sup> in plots without 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> removal.
