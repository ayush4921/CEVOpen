<p>In early and mid‐growth stages (60 days and 90 days, respectively), there was no significant difference in root length of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> plants between treatments (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36938-tbl-0005" ref-type="table">5</xref>). In later growth stages (i.e., 120 days), root length in higher mixed ratios of 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> to 
 <italic>Mikania</italic>, that is, 1M3P and 2M2P, was significantly lower than for the 3M1P ratio or when grown by itself (4M) (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36938-tbl-0005" ref-type="table">5</xref>). This was similar for plant height between 60 and 90 days of growth, being significantly lower in all the three competition treatments, that is, 3M1P, 2M2P, and 1M3P, compared to when grown by itself (4M) (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36938-tbl-0005" ref-type="table">5</xref>). In the competition experiment, as the ratio of 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> to 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> increased, 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> plant height decreased significantly following 120 days of growth (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36938-tbl-0005" ref-type="table">5</xref>). 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> did not branch after the first 60 days of growth, and there were no significant differences in the number of branches between treatments until 90 days of growth. Branch numbers of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> also declined gradually as the ratio of 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> to 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> increased at day 120 (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36938-tbl-0005" ref-type="table">5</xref>).
