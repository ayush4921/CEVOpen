<p>Aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> leaves and stems with lower concentration had inhibitory effects on the seed germination and seedling growth of 
 <italic>Pueraria;</italic> however, its stem aqueous extract with high concentration promoted seed germination of 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36938-tbl-0004" ref-type="table">4</xref>). The overall synthetical effect value of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> on 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> was −0.64. The allelopathic inhibition of 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> on 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> is therefore stronger than that of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> on 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic>.
