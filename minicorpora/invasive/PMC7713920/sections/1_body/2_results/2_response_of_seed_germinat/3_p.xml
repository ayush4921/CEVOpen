<p>Results from general linear models showed that growing time, plant species, and their interaction had a significant effect on total biomass and plant height. The effects of growing time and plant species on plant height were much greater than on total biomass, whereas their interaction on plant height was lower than on total biomass (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36938-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Both H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>‐treated and sterilized 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> seeds broke the soil surface about a week earlier than 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> seeds. 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> seedlings were small and slim at day 15, while 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> seedlings of the same age were taller and stronger. 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> seedlings from H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>‐treated seeds were the best in appearance at day 15 compared to all other seedlings (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36938-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). The size of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> seedlings was only similar to 15‐day‐old 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> seedlings after 45 days of growth. 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> started to form tendrils after 60 days but not 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36938-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). There were no significant differences in total biomass, number of leaves, and plant height between 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> seedlings, irrespective of scarification treatment, and both seed types performed better than 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36938-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1b–d</xref>). Total biomass and plant height of 45‐day‐old 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> seedlings were equivalent to that of 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> at 15 days (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36938-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1b,d</xref>). Furthermore, total biomass of 60‐day‐old 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> was equivalent to those of 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> at 30 days (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36938-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Furthermore, linear regression analysis and 
 <italic>t</italic> test for two independent samples indicated that the growth rate of 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> seedlings was significantly higher than that of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> seedlings in each stage throughout the growth period.
