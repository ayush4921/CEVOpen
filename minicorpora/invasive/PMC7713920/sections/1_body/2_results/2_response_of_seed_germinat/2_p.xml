<p>The germination rate of 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> seeds was significantly lower than for 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> seeds, especially under light conditions (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36938-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). However, sulfuric acid treatment significantly improved both the germination rate and germination index of 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> seeds. 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> seeds (treated by H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>) germinated between 5.05 and 11.05 times faster than those of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic>. The germination of 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> seeds was not affected by the light. Conversely, the germination rate and germination speed of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> were lower under the dark than under light conditions (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36938-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>).
