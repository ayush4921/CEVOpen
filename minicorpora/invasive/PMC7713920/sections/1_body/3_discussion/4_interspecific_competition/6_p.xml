<p>Our field data corroborated our potting experiments. We found that the removal of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> more severely impacted its performance than 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> sowing density, so management interventions require both the removal of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> biomass and active restoration. Similar competitive effects of 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> on other invasive vines have been observed, for example, we previously found the recruitment of invasive 
 <italic>Ipomoea cairica</italic> to be severely hampered by 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> (Li et al.,
