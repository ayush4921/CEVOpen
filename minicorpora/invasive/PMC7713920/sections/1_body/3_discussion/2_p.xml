<p>Understanding the ecological mechanisms that underlie the invasion success of non‚Äênative species has attracted much research attention, yet surprisingly little is known on how these processes may inform management and the restoration of invaded habitats. Using native and invasive vines, we provide evidence to suggest that with careful selection of native species, based on intrinsic ecological and physiological attributes, enhanced ecological restoration outcomes may be achieved.</p>
