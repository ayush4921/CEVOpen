<p>Abiotic environmental conditions represent a significant barrier to the establishment success of, and subsequent invasion by, non‐native species (Blackburn et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36938-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). We found the rate and speed of germination of scarified 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> seeds to be much higher than for 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> seeds, independent of light exposure. 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> seedlings were also taller and stronger than 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> during early growth, becoming more evident over time, as indicated by total biomass accumulation, number of leaves produced, and plant height. 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> seeds germinated one week earlier than 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> seeds and the growth performance of 
 <italic>Mikania</italic> seedlings lagged behind 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> seedlings for at least 1 month. Thus, abiotic conditions differentially affected the performance of these two vines and early emergence, fast germination, and seedling growth may lead to a priority effect of 
 <italic>Pueraria</italic> on 
 <italic>Mikania</italic>, and possibly to the pre‐emption of resources. Early emergence is also expected to increase other components of plant fitness such as seedling growth (Verdu &amp; Traveset, 
 <xref rid="ece36938-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). Others have previously found native species to similarly suppress the performance of invaders, suggesting that the ability of pioneer native species to rapidly colonize available habitat may suppress invasive species (Firn et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36938-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>).
