0: We developed a straightforward spatiotemporal lattice model to explore the evolution of plant dispersal strategies in landscapes differing in their degree of fragmentation (patch size and inter-patch distance) and landscape dynamics (patch turnover).
1: We excluded any variation in life history traits and competitive interactions between plants; all plants were completely similar entities that only differed in the shape of their dispersal kernels.
2: To explore different dispersal strategies, we used the power-law relationship used in animal search studies, and converted it into a bi-dimensional and normalized dispersal kernel.
3: More specifically, we simulated seed dispersal kernels using a truncated two-dimensional (isotropic) Pareto distribution with discrete values of shape parameter   ranging from 1.1 to 5 (Fig.
