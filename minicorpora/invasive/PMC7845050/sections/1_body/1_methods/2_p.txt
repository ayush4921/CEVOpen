0: where  lmin is the minimum distance (radius of a grid cell),  lmax is the maximum distance (equal to the domain size) and   is the scaling exponent.
1: The scaling exponent determines the power-law decay of the dispersal kernel.
2: This scaling exponent makes the 2D-Pareto kernel a very convenient tool to explore different dispersal strategies.
3: By changing only one parameter, the kernel can cover a full range of dispersal strategies ranging from very local (short-distance dispersal dominated,   > 3) to non-local (relatively high probability of long-distance dispersal,    1) and all scales in between.
4: For   ~ 2 (i.e., canonical multi-scale strategy), this kernel produces a highly heterogeneous distribution of dispersal distances, which slowly decays in frequency from short to long dispersal distances.
5: From search theory we know that the scaling exponent in power law kernels strongly determines the inherent spreading properties (i.e.
6: from Brownian motion to anomalous diffusivity) and effectively trades the sampling effort across scales [ 35].
7: This is not always true when considering other kinds of distributions described by a shape and a scale parameter, where the heterogeneity of dispersal scales is not as high as in power laws.
8: Indeed, in power-law kernels, convergence to Gaussian spreading (normal diffusion) is very slow, whereas other distributions may converge to Gaussian spreading very fast.
