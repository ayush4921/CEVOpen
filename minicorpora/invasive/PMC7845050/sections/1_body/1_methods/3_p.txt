0: We compared these 2D-Pareto kernels to benchmark kernels or limiting cases on both ends of the spectrum: uniform dispersal across the entire domain (as benchmark for minimum  ) and dispersal only to the eight nearest neighbours (Moore neighbourhood) in equal probabilities (as benchmark for maximum  ).
1: In each model-run, two plant types with different dispersal kernels competed in a landscape with specified fragmentation and patch turnover characteristics.
2: Plants were initially randomly placed in equal proportions throughout a landscape.
3: For simplicity, plants only produced seeds once per generation and then died (i.e., we simulated semelparous plants).
4: Between generations, the types were redistributed over the landscape following four consecutive steps: 1) dispersal, 2) death, 3) patch turnover, and 4) colonization.
5: The type that remained after multiple generations was assumed to have the better dispersal strategy.
6: We then related these dispersal strategies to three important dispersal metrics that quantify the success of dispersal.
7: A conceptual figure illustrating the model and model details are provided in Appendix  S2.
