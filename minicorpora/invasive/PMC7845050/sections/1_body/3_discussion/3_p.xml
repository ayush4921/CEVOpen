<p id="Par34">Some hypotheses generated within our study may appear counterintuitive. For example, species in homogeneous habitats are suggested to have uniform dispersal kernels. This hypothesis would explain why, indeed, many species of large-scale, more or less continuous habitats, such as primary forest [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>] and heathlands [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>], have adaptations for very long-distance dispersal. Previous studies may have suggested that these adaptations serve to avoid density-dependent mortality close to the parent [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>], but this would not explain dispersal over more than a few tens of m (the decay rate of pest-induced mortality, [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]). Our results suggest that selection for kin avoidance may explain these long-distance dispersal syndromes, although escaping density-dependent mortality may be an additional, enforcing factor.
