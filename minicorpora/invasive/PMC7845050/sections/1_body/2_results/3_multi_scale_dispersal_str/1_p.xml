<p id="Par30">In many landscapes, habitat distribution is patchy and dynamic to some extent. In these situations, evolved dispersal strategies are dominated by multi-scale dispersal strategies (e.g., Lévy-like Pareto distributions). These strategies balance local, within-patch dispersal to provide high habitat encounter rates, and non-local dispersal to avoid kin competition and colonize new patches. This balance is driven by all patch distribution characteristics: patch size, inter-patch distance and patch turnover rate (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, Appendix 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). The ESS’s for these landscapes, as reflected by 
 <italic>μ</italic>, are most strongly determined by patch turnover rates (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>), which very strongly increase the need to colonize new patches. Higher patch turnover rates correspond to lower values of

 <italic>μ</italic> ~ 2 for a wide range of landscapes with patch turnover rates between 0.1 and 1 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Secondarily, evolutionarily stable dispersal strategies are also driven by the relative importance of colonization of new patches in relation to habitat encounter and kin competition, which decrease with patch size and inter-patch distance (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, S5). Under low dynamic conditions, this translates to multi-scale dispersal strategies with more local dispersal when patch sizes are small and inter-patch distances short (as the role of habitat encounter becomes more important, 
 <italic>μ</italic> → 3). Under highly dynamic conditions, this translates to more long-distance dispersal when inter-patch distances are large (as the effects on colonization are strengthened by the role of kin avoidance, 
 <italic>μ</italic> → 1.5; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). Mid-range dispersal is an important component of all these strategies.
