<p id="Par28">When the distribution of habitat is patchy in space and static in time, the landscape is highly predictable and movement strategies dominated by short-distance dispersal are evolutionarily stable (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a-c). The shape of these short-distance dispersal kernels varies with patch size, with decreasing patch sizes corresponding to shorter dispersal distances (larger 
 <italic>μ</italic>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). These movement strategies are essentially driven by the optimization of both habitat encounter and kin avoidance (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d-f). With increasing patch size, the edge-to-area ratio decreases and habitat encounter increases accordingly, allowing for strategies with somewhat longer dispersal, which improves kin avoidance. In some situations, when patches are small and inter-patch distances relatively long, several short-distance dispersal strategies can coexist (see the ‘0’s in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In these situations, patches are dominated by one of the plant types within a few generations based on chance and, after that, are almost impossible to be invaded by the other plant type in distant patches as these reach other patches only in low numbers.
