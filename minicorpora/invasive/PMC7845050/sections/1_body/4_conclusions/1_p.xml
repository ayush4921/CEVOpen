<p id="Par40">Our results clearly show that the full range of dispersal kernels, from extreme long-distance to short distance dispersal, can be adaptive, depending on the spatiotemporal habitat distribution across the landscape. Intermediate landscape dynamics and fragmentation would lead to the most complex and heterogeneous (multi-scale) kernels in terms of seed distributions. These multiple scales reflect an intensive-extensive search trade-off that determines the success rates of habitat encounter, kin avoidance, and colonization of new patches. Our analysis can serve as a framework that generates null hypotheses for dispersal strategies of plant species based on the spatiotemporal distribution of their habitat that can be used to analyse and compare plant dispersal data.</p>
