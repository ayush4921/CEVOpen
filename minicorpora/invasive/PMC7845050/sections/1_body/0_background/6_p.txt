0: Although these recent developments have significantly advanced our understanding of the evolution and ecology of animal movement [ 46], the potential for evolution of similar random search strategies has not been explored for plants.
1: We propose that the move length distribution (i.e., seed dispersal distance distribution or dispersal kernel) generated by all the seeds coming from a single plant can be viewed as a movement strategy to search for suitable habitat, or more specifically, suitable sites for germination, establishment and reproduction.
2: As adult plants are otherwise immobile, we expect that there is strong selective pressure on such dispersal kernels.
