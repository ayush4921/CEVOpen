<p id="Par17">In animal movement analysis, movement paths are decomposed into consecutive movement steps of a specific length (move length) that are separated by changes in direction (turns) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Move length distributions can be described by power-law relationships (p(

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. These complex multi-scale movement strategies are known as Lévy flights or walks [
