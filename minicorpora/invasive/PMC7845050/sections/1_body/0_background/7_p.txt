0: Here, we provide a theoretical framework that identifies null models for (evolution of) dispersal strategies in plant populations and explores the impact of spatiotemporal landscape structure (habitat fragmentation and patch turnover dynamics) on dispersal evolution, considering dispersal as a search strategy.
1: For our study we used a 2D Pareto kernel, where changes of a single parameter, the scaling exponent, lead to strong changes in the diffusive properties of the kernel.
2: We acknowledge that evolved plant dispersal strategies should match relevant biotic and abiotic factors determining eventual offspring success, such as the spatial structure of density-dependent mortality [ 47], competition, and facilitation [ 48,  49].
3: However, in this study, we first explore the evolution of dispersal strategies in a neutral context where plants are identical except for dispersal strategy.
4: By focussing primarily on dispersal strategy in relation to spatiotemporal habitat distribution, we derive fundamental null models that can serve as the basis for extension in the future to explore effects of additional relevant factors.
