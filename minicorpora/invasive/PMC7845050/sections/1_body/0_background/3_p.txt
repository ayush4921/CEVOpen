0: Following these lines, we argue here that for the purpose of investigating plant ecological and evolutionary processes, it is necessary to move beyond dispersal propensity and single-scale views of the dispersal kernel, and instead assess the entire distribution of seed dispersal distances.
1: We propose that plant dispersal strategies evolve as search strategies for suitable habitat, in a way comparable to stochastic searches made by other moving organisms.
2: Reynolds [ 33] already hypothesized that plants may maximize the likelihood of finding the nearest unoccupied site by adopting a Levy flight-shaped inverse power-law seed dispersal kernel.
3: We propose that plant species have a wide range of dispersal strategies, that each evolved in search of  all suitable habitat of the species, and therefore depend strongly on the spatial and temporal distribution of their habitat.
4: Using a theoretical framework inspired by animal movement ecology, we show how recent conceptual developments in analysing animal movement data can advance the field of plant dispersal ecology towards identification of evolutionary drivers and ecological consequences of seed dispersal strategies.
