0: In a random search, the move length distribution that maximizes search efficiency depends on the spatiotemporal distribution of targets being sought (e.g., food, mates [ 37,  40,  41]).
1: Theoretical studies have shown that various strategies may effectively balance movements across different scales, depending on the spatiotemporal environmental conditions [ 39 43].
2: Importantly, this balance is determined by the entire move length distribution.
3: Experimental studies have shown that complex animal movement patterns indeed have intrinsic underlying patterns that optimize random search efficiency, thereby greatly enhancing individual fitness [ 39,  44 46].
