0: Dispersal plays a crucial role in the population dynamics and ecological interactions of plant species.
1: In light of ongoing habitat fragmentation and climate change, dispersal is a particularly critical determinant of local, regional, and global plant species survival [ 1 4].
2: This realisation has elevated plant dispersal to a research priority in the last decades.
3: Quantitative information on plant species dispersal distance distributions (or dispersal kernels) is needed for adequate species management, as dispersal kernels determine colonization probabilities, restoration success, and speeds of range expansions and invasions.
4: Indeed, significant progress has been made in understanding how mechanisms of seed dispersal determine seed dispersal kernels [ 5 8], and how these may be affected by global changes [ 1,  9 11].
5: However, the selective pressures responsible for the evolution of dispersal strategies remain elusive.
