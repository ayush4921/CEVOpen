0: In animal movement analysis, movement paths are decomposed into consecutive movement steps of a specific length (move length) that are separated by changes in direction (turns) [ 34,  35].
1: Move length distributions can be described by power-law relationships (p( x) ~  x-  ; Fig.
2: 1a), where a single scaling parameter governs the relationship between move lengths and their frequency.
3: This scaling parameter   can range from ~ 1 (where steps of all lengths are equally abundant) to > 3 (approximating Brownian motion, where short steps are abundant and long steps are very rare).
4: At an intermediate   ~ 2, many consecutive short-distance movements are alternated with infrequent long-distance movements, producing complex multi-scale movement patterns where many different move lengths occur [ 35 39].
5: These complex multi-scale movement strategies are known as Levy flights or walks [ 36].
