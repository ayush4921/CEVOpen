<p id="Par19">Although these recent developments have significantly advanced our understanding of the evolution and ecology of animal movement [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], the potential for evolution of similar random search strategies has not been explored for plants. We propose that the move length distribution (i.e., seed dispersal distance distribution or dispersal kernel) generated by all the seeds coming from a single plant can be viewed as a movement strategy to search for suitable habitat, or more specifically, suitable sites for germination, establishment and reproduction. As adult plants are otherwise immobile, we expect that there is strong selective pressure on such dispersal kernels.
