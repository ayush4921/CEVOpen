 <caption> Conceptual diagram showing a range of dynamic (disturbances, successional grassland, forest gaps) and static (rocky outcrops, forests) habitats across gradients in inter-patch distance and patch size. In static, but patchy habitats, short-distance dispersal ( μ &gt; 3) dominates dispersal strategies. Extreme long-distance dispersal ( μ → 1) is favoured in both stable, continuous habitats or in extremely unpredictable and dynamic landscapes. In patchy and dynamic habitats, Lévy-like, multi-scale dispersal strategies are optimal, with μ correlated to average patch size, inter-patch distance and, most importantly, patch turnover rate. Species examples are given; data from 1Colas et al. 1997 [ 60], 2Bakker 1961 [ 61], 3Soons et al. 2005 [ 62], 4Alvarez -Buylla &amp; Martinez-Ramos 1990 [ 63], 5Katul et al. 2005 [ 64], 6Nathan et al. 2002 [ 65] </caption>
