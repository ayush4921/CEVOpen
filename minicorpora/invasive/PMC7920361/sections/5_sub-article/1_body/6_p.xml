<p>Reviewer 2 and 3 felt the paper was much improved and have recommended accept. However, reviewer 1 was not satisfied and recommended rejection. The main sticking point is still the issue with Bipolaris. I wonder if it is possible to recover Bipolaris from infected lesions, i.e. perform Koch's postulates on a small number of representative infected leaves? Or, perhaps it is possible to artificially infect some plants with Bipolaris spores? Otherwise, the authors will need to better convince reviewer 1of the merits of the study as it stands.</p>
