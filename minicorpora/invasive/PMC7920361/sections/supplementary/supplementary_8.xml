  <p>The estimated number of 
   <italic>Microstegium</italic> leaves with lesions across the 
   <italic>Microstegium</italic> density gradient following 
   <italic>B</italic>. 
   <italic>gigantea</italic> inoculation when grown in the presence of (A) 
   <italic>Dichanthelium</italic>, (B) 
   <italic>Elymus</italic>, and (C) 
   <italic>Eragrostis</italic> (mean Â± 95% confidence intervals). All leaves with lesions were counted and the total number leaves per pot were estimated by counting the number of leaves on up to three plants per pot.
