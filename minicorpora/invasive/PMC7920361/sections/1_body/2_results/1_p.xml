<p>We observed 
 <italic>Bipolaris</italic>-like lesions on 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> leaves in 94% of pots in which 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> was planted and inoculated. The average 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> disease incidence in low-density pots (i.e., two 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> plants) was 8% (95% CI: 6%–11%). The species identity of the native plant in low density pots did not significantly affect 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> disease incidence (
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> disease incidence was constant across the 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> density gradient when 
 <italic>Elymus</italic> was present (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237894.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). However, 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> disease incidence decreased by four percentage points (95% CI: -7%–-2%) and five percentage points (95% CI: -7%–-3%) when 100 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> were grown with 
 <italic>Dichanthelium</italic> and 
 <italic>Eragrostis</italic>, respectively, relative to pots with two 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> plants and the same native species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237894.g002">Fig 2A and 2C</xref>). The total number of leaves per pot increased across the 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> density gradient while the number of leaves with lesions increased more slowly or not at all (
