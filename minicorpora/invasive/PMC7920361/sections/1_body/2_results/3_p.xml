 <italic>Bipolaris gigantea</italic> inoculation did not significantly affect 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> biomass relative to the mock inoculation control (
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In addition, 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> biomass was not significantly different among treatments with different native species (
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> biomass increased with 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> density (0.16 g plant
 <sup>-1</sup>, 95% CI: 0.05 g plant
 <sup>-1</sup>â€“0.28 g plant
 <sup>-1</sup>) and the relationship between biomass and density varied in shape, although not significantly, when grown with the three species: saturating at high densities when grown with 
 <italic>Dichanthelium</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237894.g004">Fig 4A</xref>), increasing nearly linearly when grown with 
 <italic>Elymus</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237894.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), and peaking at intermediate densities when grown with 
 <italic>Eragrostis</italic> (
