0: To evaluate disease incidence on plants across the  Microstegium density gradient, we fit a generalized linear regression to the estimated proportion of  Microstegium leaves with lesions per pathogen-inoculated pot using  Microstegium density (the number of  Microstegium seeds added to each pot), native species identity, and their interaction as the explanatory variables.
1: The model was fit with Bayesian statistical inference using the brm function in the brms package [ 47], an interface for Stan [ 48], in R version 3.5.2 [ 49].
2: The model contained three Markov chains with 6000 iterations each and a discarded burn-in period of 1000 iterations.
3: We chose prior distributions based on whether model variables could reasonably take on negative values in addition to positive values (Gaussian or Cauchy) or not (gamma or exponential).
4: We chose parameters for prior distributions that reflected limited a priori information about variable values.
5: We used a binomial response distribution (logit link) and a Gaussian distribution for the intercept and coefficient priors (location = 0, scale = 10).
6: We calculated the mean and 95% highest posterior density interval (hereafter, credible interval) of back-transformed (from logit to percentage) model estimates using the mean_hdi function in the tidybayes package [ 50].
7: There were too few native plant leaves with lesions to statistically analyze disease incidence, nevertheless, we present these results graphically to assess qualitative patterns.
