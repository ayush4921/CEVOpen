0: To evaluate the effects of  Microstegium density and  B.  gigantea inoculation on  Microstegium performance, we fit a linear regression to  Microstegium biomass:  biomassnativespeciesinoculation(Microstegiumdensity+Microstegiumdensity2).
1: This formulation allowed us to estimate quadratic relationships between  Microstegium biomass and  Microstegium density for each native speciesinoculation treatment combination.
2: We used a Gaussian response distribution, a Gaussian distribution for the intercept prior (location = 2, scale = 10) and the coefficient priors (location = 0, scale = 10), and a Cauchy distribution for the standard deviation prior (location = 0, scale = 1).
3: Otherwise, the model was fit using the same methods described for disease incidence.
