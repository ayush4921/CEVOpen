0: We performed the experiment in a greenhouse in Gainesville, FL, USA, from June 19, 2019 to September 12, 2019.
1: We used  Microstegium seeds collected from Big Oaks National Wildlife Refuge (BONWR) in Madison, IN, USA (38.9365, -85.4148) in 2015,  Elymus and  Eragrostis seeds purchased from Prairie Moon Nursery (Winona, MN, USA) in 2018, and  Dichanthelium seeds purchased from Sheffields Seed Company (Locke, NY, USA) in 2018.
2: All seeds were stored at 4C.
3: Prior to the experiment, seeds of each species were planted in a greenhouse and seedlings developed no lesions, suggesting that lesions caused by  B.  gigantea inoculation were unlikely to be confused with lesions caused by potential seedborne pathogens.
4: The potting mix used in the experiment (Jolly Gardener Pro-Line Custom Growing Mix) was autoclaved at 120130C for 30 minutes and all pots and trays were sprayed with 10% bleach solution (0.6% sodium hypochlorite) and rinsed with tap water after approximately five minutes to minimize risk of contamination by non-focal pathogens.
