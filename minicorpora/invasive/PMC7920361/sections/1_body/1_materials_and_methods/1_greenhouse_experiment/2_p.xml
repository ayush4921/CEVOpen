<p>To quantify the effect of 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> competition on the native species, we used an additive competition experimental design [
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] with one individual of a native species surrounded by 0, 2, 10, 50, or 100 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> plants per 1 L pot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237894.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). First, we sowed seeds for each native species into separate trays to germinate. Seven days later, we planted 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> seeds in 1 L pots according to their density treatment (50 and 100 seed numbers estimated by weight). The native species were transplanted from germination trays to the 1 L pots with 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> after growing in the greenhouse for 28 days. We chose native plant individuals that were similar in size (2 to 3 true leaves) to transplant into pots. The 15 plant combinations (each of the three native species with five 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> densities) were replicated eight times, half of which were inoculated with 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>gigantea</italic> and half of which were mock inoculated with a control solution.
