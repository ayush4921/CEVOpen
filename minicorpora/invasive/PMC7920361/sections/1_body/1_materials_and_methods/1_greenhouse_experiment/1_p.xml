<p>We performed the experiment in a greenhouse in Gainesville, FL, USA, from June 19, 2019 to September 12, 2019. We used 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> seeds collected from Big Oaks National Wildlife Refuge (BONWR) in Madison, IN, USA (38.9365, -85.4148) in 2015, 
 <italic>Elymus</italic> and 
 <italic>Eragrostis</italic> seeds purchased from Prairie Moon Nursery (Winona, MN, USA) in 2018, and 
 <italic>Dichanthelium</italic> seeds purchased from Sheffield’s Seed Company (Locke, NY, USA) in 2018. All seeds were stored at 4°C. Prior to the experiment, seeds of each species were planted in a greenhouse and seedlings developed no lesions, suggesting that lesions caused by 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>gigantea</italic> inoculation were unlikely to be confused with lesions caused by potential seedborne pathogens. The potting mix used in the experiment (Jolly Gardener Pro-Line Custom Growing Mix) was autoclaved at 120–130°C for 30 minutes and all pots and trays were sprayed with 10% bleach solution (0.6% sodium hypochlorite) and rinsed with tap water after approximately five minutes to minimize risk of contamination by non-focal pathogens.
