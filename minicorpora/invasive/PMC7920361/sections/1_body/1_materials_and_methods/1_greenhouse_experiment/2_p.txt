0: To quantify the effect of  Microstegium competition on the native species, we used an additive competition experimental design [ 41,  43] with one individual of a native species surrounded by 0, 2, 10, 50, or 100  Microstegium plants per 1 L pot ( Fig 1A and 1B).
1: First, we sowed seeds for each native species into separate trays to germinate.
2: Seven days later, we planted  Microstegium seeds in 1 L pots according to their density treatment (50 and 100 seed numbers estimated by weight).
3: The native species were transplanted from germination trays to the 1 L pots with  Microstegium after growing in the greenhouse for 28 days.
4: We chose native plant individuals that were similar in size (2 to 3 true leaves) to transplant into pots.
5: The 15 plant combinations (each of the three native species with five  Microstegium densities) were replicated eight times, half of which were inoculated with  B.  gigantea and half of which were mock inoculated with a control solution.
