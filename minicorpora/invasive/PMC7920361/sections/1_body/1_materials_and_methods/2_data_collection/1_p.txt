0: To assess disease incidence (i.e., the percentage of leaves per pot with at least one lesion [ 45]) 14 days after inoculation, we recorded the number of  Microstegium leaves with one or more  Bipolaris-like lesions ( Fig 1C) and the total number of leaves for three  Microstegium plants per pot (or two plants for the pots with only two).
1: No other types of lesions were observed on the plants.
2: The number of leaves per plant were averaged within pots and multiplied by the total number of plants per pot, based on seeding rate, to estimate the total number of  Microstegium leaves per pot.
3: For native plants that received the  B.  gigantea inoculation treatment and had lesions, we counted the number of leaves with at least one lesion and the total number of leaves per plant.
4: None of the plants in mock-inoculated pots had lesions with one exception: in one pot that contained  Dichanthelium and 100  Microstegium plants, 46  Microstegium leaves had lesions.
5: We removed this replicate from analyses.
