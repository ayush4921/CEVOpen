0: We used these visual assessments of  Bipolaris-like lesions to approximate  B.  gigantea infection of experimental plants.
1: Bipolaris gigantea association with foliar lesions can be assessed by using microscopy to identify conidiophores on leaves after incubation [ 35].
2: The absence of  B.  gigantea conidiophores in lesions, however, does not confirm that it is not the causal agent.
3: In leaf samples collected from BONWR in 2018 and 2019, 67% of  Microstegium samples ( n = 238) and 48% of  Elymus samples ( n = 65) that had  Bipolaris-like lesions also had  B.  gigantea conidiophores identifiable by microscopy.
4: In addition, 28% of  Microstegium samples ( n = 29) and 1% of  Elymus samples ( n = 106) that did not have  Bipolaris-like lesions had  B.  gigantea conidiophores identifiable by microscopy ( S1 Table).
5: Therefore,  Bipolaris-like lesions are commonly associated with  B.  gigantea infection and it is less common for leaves to be infected without lesions.
6: Because we did not test leaves for infection with  B.  gigantea following inoculation, we present results in the context of the inoculation treatments rather than infection status.
