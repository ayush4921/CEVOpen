<p>To assess disease incidence (i.e., the percentage of leaves per pot with at least one lesion [
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]) 14 days after inoculation, we recorded the number of 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> leaves with one or more 
 <italic>Bipolaris</italic>-like lesions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237894.g001">Fig 1C</xref>) and the total number of leaves for three 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> plants per pot (or two plants for the pots with only two). No other types of lesions were observed on the plants. The number of leaves per plant were averaged within pots and multiplied by the total number of plants per pot, based on seeding rate, to estimate the total number of 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> leaves per pot. For native plants that received the 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>gigantea</italic> inoculation treatment and had lesions, we counted the number of leaves with at least one lesion and the total number of leaves per plant. None of the plants in mock-inoculated pots had lesions with one exception: in one pot that contained 
 <italic>Dichanthelium</italic> and 100 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> plants, 46 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> leaves had lesions. We removed this replicate from analyses.
