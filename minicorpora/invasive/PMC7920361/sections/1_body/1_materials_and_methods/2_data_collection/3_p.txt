0: To assess plant performance, we harvested the aboveground biomass of all pots on September 12, 2019 (51 days after inoculation), separated the native plants from the  Microstegium, dried the biomass at 60C to constant mass, and weighed it.
1: Biomass production can act as a proxy for perennial plant fitness [ 41].
2: While seed production is a more meaningful measure of annual plant fitness [ 41],  Microstegium biomass is correlated with its seed production [ 46].
