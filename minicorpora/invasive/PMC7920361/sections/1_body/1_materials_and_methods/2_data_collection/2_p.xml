<p>We used these visual assessments of 
 <italic>Bipolaris</italic>-like lesions to approximate 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>gigantea</italic> infection of experimental plants. 
 <italic>Bipolaris gigantea</italic> association with foliar lesions can be assessed by using microscopy to identify conidiophores on leaves after incubation [
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The absence of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>gigantea</italic> conidiophores in lesions, however, does not confirm that it is not the causal agent. In leaf samples collected from BONWR in 2018 and 2019, 67% of 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> samples (
 <italic>n</italic> = 238) and 48% of 
 <italic>Elymus</italic> samples (
 <italic>n</italic> = 65) that had 
 <italic>Bipolaris</italic>-like lesions also had 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>gigantea</italic> conidiophores identifiable by microscopy. In addition, 28% of 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> samples (
 <italic>n</italic> = 29) and 1% of 
 <italic>Elymus</italic> samples (
 <italic>n</italic> = 106) that did not have 
 <italic>Bipolaris</italic>-like lesions had 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>gigantea</italic> conidiophores identifiable by microscopy (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0237894.s002">S1 Table</xref>). Therefore, 
 <italic>Bipolaris</italic>-like lesions are commonly associated with 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>gigantea</italic> infection and it is less common for leaves to be infected without lesions. Because we did not test leaves for infection with 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>gigantea</italic> following inoculation, we present results in the context of the inoculation treatments rather than infection status.
