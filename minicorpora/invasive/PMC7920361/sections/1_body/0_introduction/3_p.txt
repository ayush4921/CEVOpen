0: Disease can modify the effects of plants on shared resources and their responses to resource limitation [ 25].
1: For example, disease-induced reductions in total leaf area can decrease light interception [ 26], potentially increasing light availability to lower canopy levels and decreasing photosynthesis of infected plants.
2: If disease disproportionately impacts invasive species, reductions in growth and resource uptake may release native species from competition, which was reported when a powdery mildew fungus infected invasive garlic mustard ( Alliaria petiolata) [ 15].
3: In contrast, disease-induced fitness costs may reduce the competitive ability of native species, which is hypothesized to have promoted invasion of European grasses in California [ 12,  13].
4: Plant species can vary widely in their competitive ability [ 27,  28], susceptibility to infection [ 29,  30], and performance losses due to disease [ 23,  31].
5: Differential responses of native species to disease and competition with an invasive species could determine how the native plant community responds to disease-mediated competition.
