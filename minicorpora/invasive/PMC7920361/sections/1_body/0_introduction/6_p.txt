0: Competitive ability depends on the fitness of species in the absence of competition and their responses to changes in intraspecific and interspecific competitor densities (i.e., competition coefficients) [ 41,  42].
1: Here we investigated how  B.  gigantea inoculation affected the competitive ability of the three native perennial grass species in a greenhouse experiment by measuring their competition-free biomass and responses to  Microstegium density.
2: We were uncertain about how  B.  gigantea would affect native species biomass, but acknowledged that a range of outcomes were possible given interspecific variation in host-pathogen interactions [ 29 31], including decreased, increased (e.g., through compensatory growth), and no change in biomass.
3: We hypothesized that  B.  gigantea infection would reduce the negative effect of  Microstegium density on native plant biomass because diseased  Microstegium would be smaller [ 29,  34].
4: However, we also expected that disease-induced biomass reduction experienced by some native species would increase their sensitivity to  Microstegium density.
