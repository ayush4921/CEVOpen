<p>Both plant invasions and infectious diseases can affect natural plant communities by reducing plant diversity and biomass production [

 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Invasive species and disease outbreaks can co-occur in communities because the species are co-introduced, or because invasive species amplify disease transmission [
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Invasive plants can negatively impact native plant communities through competition [
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and diseases may increase, decrease, or have no net effect on invasive plant impacts [
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The responses of both the invasive species and competing native species to infection can determine which of these outcomes occurs [

 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. For example, infected invasive plants are predicted to have lower competitive effects than uninfected invasive plants when native species have greater disease resistance or tolerance [
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In empirical and theoretical tests of disease-mediated competition between a single native plant species and a single invasive plant species, disease has both increased [

 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] impacts of the invasive species. However, the relevant guild of native species in natural communities is often diverse and species vary in their susceptibility to pathogen infection [
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], making it unclear whether results from studies of disease-mediated competition with one native species apply to the broader native community.
