<p>Disease can modify the effects of plants on shared resources and their responses to resource limitation [
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. For example, disease-induced reductions in total leaf area can decrease light interception [
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], potentially increasing light availability to lower canopy levels and decreasing photosynthesis of infected plants. If disease disproportionately impacts invasive species, reductions in growth and resource uptake may release native species from competition, which was reported when a powdery mildew fungus infected invasive garlic mustard (
 <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic>) [
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In contrast, disease-induced fitness costs may reduce the competitive ability of native species, which is hypothesized to have promoted invasion of European grasses in California [

 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Plant species can vary widely in their competitive ability [

 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], susceptibility to infection [
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and performance losses due to disease [
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Differential responses of native species to disease and competition with an invasive species could determine how the native plant community responds to disease-mediated competition.
