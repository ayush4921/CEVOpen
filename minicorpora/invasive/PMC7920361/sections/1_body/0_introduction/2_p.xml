<p>A shared pathogen can create an antagonistic interaction between two or more host species (i.e., apparent competition), even in the absence of other forms of interaction, such as resource competition [
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Increases in the abundance of one host species can decrease the fitness of another through transmission and the negative effects of disease [
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Invasive species may enhance pathogen transmission to or disease impacts on native species [

 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. For example, high densities of invasive cheatgrass (
 <italic>Bromus tectorum</italic>) promoted infection of native plant seeds by a fungal pathogen [
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Pathogen infection of native or invasive plants can reduce growth, reproduction, and survival [

 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], as well as induce compensatory growth or reproduction [

 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Because disease can influence the productivity and composition of natural plant communities [
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], disease amplification by invasive plants could have potentially strong effects on native plant communities [
