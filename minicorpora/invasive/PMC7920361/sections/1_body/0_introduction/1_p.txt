0: Both plant invasions and infectious diseases can affect natural plant communities by reducing plant diversity and biomass production [ 1 4].
1: Invasive species and disease outbreaks can co-occur in communities because the species are co-introduced, or because invasive species amplify disease transmission [ 5].
2: Invasive plants can negatively impact native plant communities through competition [ 6] and diseases may increase, decrease, or have no net effect on invasive plant impacts [ 7,  8].
3: The responses of both the invasive species and competing native species to infection can determine which of these outcomes occurs [ 9,  10].
4: For example, infected invasive plants are predicted to have lower competitive effects than uninfected invasive plants when native species have greater disease resistance or tolerance [ 11].
5: In empirical and theoretical tests of disease-mediated competition between a single native plant species and a single invasive plant species, disease has both increased [ 12,  13] and decreased [ 14,  15] impacts of the invasive species.
6: However, the relevant guild of native species in natural communities is often diverse and species vary in their susceptibility to pathogen infection [ 16], making it unclear whether results from studies of disease-mediated competition with one native species apply to the broader native community.
