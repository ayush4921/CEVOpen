0: Dichanthelium clandestinum L. Gould (syn.
1: Panicum clandestinum L.; deer-tongue grass, hereafter  Dichanthelium),  Elymus virginicus L. (Virginia wild rye, hereafter  Elymus), and  Eragrostis spectabilis (Pursh) Steud (purple lovegrass, hereafter  Eragrostis) are perennial grass species that are native to the U.S. and co-occur with  Microstegium [ 29,  34].
2: Bipolaris gigantea can infect, produce lesions on, and produce spores on  Elymus virginicus [ 35].
3: Bipolaris gigantea infections have been observed on  Dichanthelium clandestinum in the field, but it may not be a competent host for spore production [ 37].
4: At least three species in the genus  Eragrostis are susceptible to  B.  gigantea infection [ 37 39] and closely related plant species are more likely to share pathogens than distantly related species [ 30], suggesting that  Eragrostis spectabilis may also be susceptible to  B.  gigantea.
5: Infection by  B.  gigantea may be more likely when these grass species co-occur with  Microstegium due to high infection rates in some  Microstegium populations [ 34,  40].
6: Bipolaris gigantea may alter the competitive ability of  Microstegium or the ability of these native species to compete with  Microstegium.
