0: A shared pathogen can create an antagonistic interaction between two or more host species (i.e., apparent competition), even in the absence of other forms of interaction, such as resource competition [ 17].
1: Increases in the abundance of one host species can decrease the fitness of another through transmission and the negative effects of disease [ 17].
2: Invasive species may enhance pathogen transmission to or disease impacts on native species [ 18,  19].
3: For example, high densities of invasive cheatgrass ( Bromus tectorum) promoted infection of native plant seeds by a fungal pathogen [ 20].
4: Pathogen infection of native or invasive plants can reduce growth, reproduction, and survival [ 2,  21], as well as induce compensatory growth or reproduction [ 22,  23].
5: Because disease can influence the productivity and composition of natural plant communities [ 4], disease amplification by invasive plants could have potentially strong effects on native plant communities [ 24].
