<p>Competitive ability depends on the fitness of species in the absence of competition and their responses to changes in intraspecific and interspecific competitor densities (i.e., competition coefficients) [

 <italic>gigantea</italic> inoculation affected the competitive ability of the three native perennial grass species in a greenhouse experiment by measuring their competition-free biomass and responses to 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> density. We were uncertain about how

 <italic>gigantea</italic> would affect native species biomass, but acknowledged that a range of outcomes were possible given interspecific variation in host-pathogen interactions [

 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], including decreased, increased (e.g., through compensatory growth), and no change in biomass. We hypothesized that

 <italic>gigantea</italic> infection would reduce the negative effect of 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> density on native plant biomass because diseased
