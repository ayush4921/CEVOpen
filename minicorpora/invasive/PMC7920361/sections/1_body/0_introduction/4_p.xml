 <italic>Microstegium vimineum</italic> (Trin.) A. Camus (stilt grass, hereafter 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic>) is an annual grass species native to Asia that was first recorded in the United States in 1919 [
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> forms dense populations and litter layers in eastern and midwestern U.S. forest understories, suppressing herbaceous plants and tree seedlings [

 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Over the last two decades, 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> populations have acquired fungal leaf spot diseases caused by species in the genus 
 <italic>Bipolaris</italic> that reduce its biomass and seed production [

 <italic>Bipolaris gigantea</italic> (Heald &amp; F.A. Wolf) B. Lane, Stricker, M.E. Sm., S.L. Flory &amp; Harmon is a common pathogen of 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] that causes zonate leaf spots with dark brown margins [
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and likely disperses via wind and splashing [
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], but with restricted distances due to its large spore size [
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].
