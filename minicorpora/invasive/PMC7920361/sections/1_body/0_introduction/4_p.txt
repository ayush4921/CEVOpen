0: Microstegium vimineum (Trin.)
1: A. Camus (stilt grass, hereafter  Microstegium) is an annual grass species native to Asia that was first recorded in the United States in 1919 [ 32].
2: Microstegium forms dense populations and litter layers in eastern and midwestern U.S. forest understories, suppressing herbaceous plants and tree seedlings [ 28,  33].
3: Over the last two decades,  Microstegium populations have acquired fungal leaf spot diseases caused by species in the genus  Bipolaris that reduce its biomass and seed production [ 29,  34].
4: Bipolaris gigantea (Heald & F.A.
5: Wolf) B.
6: Lane, Stricker, M.E.
7: Sm., S.L.
8: Flory & Harmon is a common pathogen of  Microstegium [ 34] that causes zonate leaf spots with dark brown margins [ 35] and likely disperses via wind and splashing [ 36], but with restricted distances due to its large spore size [ 35,  37].
