<p>We used a greenhouse experiment to demonstrate that inoculation with a fungal leaf spot pathogen that has accumulated on a widespread invasive grass had unique effects on the growth of native species but did not modify biomass responses of native species to 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> density. Complementary experiments in the field could help determine whether these findings are consistent across other native species and when disease pressure is higher. Transmission of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>gigantea</italic> may depend on 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> densities, potentially creating feedbacks between infection and density, which we controlled for in our experiment. The competitive effects of native plant species on 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> in the presence and absence of disease also may be important for understanding long-term community dynamics [
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The emergence of infectious diseases in invaded plant communities may lead to natural biological control of the invasive species [
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], exacerbated effects of invasion if the pathogen negatively impacts native species [
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], or there may be no effect of disease [
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Altogether, our study suggests that low levels of disease caused by 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>gigantea</italic> may have unique effects on native species but are unlikely to modify the large negative impact of invasive 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> density on native species.
