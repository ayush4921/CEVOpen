<p>Our experimental methods and conditions may have limited the levels of

 <italic>gigantea</italic> leaf spot disease (see Limitations section), and there were no effects of

 <italic>gigantea</italic> inoculation on 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> biomass, likely leading to limited changes in 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> resource acquisition. Therefore, it is crucial to explore disease-mediated competitive effects of 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> in the field or with methods that may result in disease incidence approaching levels observed in the field. For example, disease incidence on 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> decreased as 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> densities increased, which is likely because the single 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>gigantea</italic> inoculation infected a relatively constant number of leaves regardless of 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> density, leading to lower percentages of leaves with lesions at higher densities. In contrast, higher plant densities in the field may promote higher disease incidence and greater inoculum production [

 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], in which case disease may have stronger impacts on 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> competition than what we observed in the experiment. Greater

 <italic>gigantea</italic> inoculum levels and multiple disease cycles may also have larger effects on native plant responses to competition, for example, through reduced ability to capture resources [

 <italic>gigantea</italic> on 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> and native plant competition may simply be minor, as has been demonstrated for disease effects on cheatgrass competition [
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and herbivory effects on Amur honeysuckle (
 <italic>Lonicera maackii</italic>) competition with native species [
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In that case, competitive effects of the invasive plant on native species are likely to overshadow the effects of disease, which may be common across plant communities [
