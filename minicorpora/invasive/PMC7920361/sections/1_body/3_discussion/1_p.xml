<p>We evaluated how inoculation with the emerging fungal pathogen 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>gigantea</italic> affected the biomasses of three native species in competition with the invasive plant 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic>. 
 <italic>Bipolaris gigantea</italic> inoculation did not significantly affect 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> biomass relative to the mock inoculation control and it had contrasting effects on the native plant species by increasing 
 <italic>Dichanthelium</italic> biomass, decreasing 
 <italic>Elymus</italic> biomass, and having no effect on 
 <italic>Eragrostis</italic> biomass. The negative effect of 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> density on biomass for each of the native species was the same whether plants were inoculated with 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>gigantea</italic> or the control. These results suggest that 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>gigantea</italic> may differentially affect native plant species in competition with 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> through species-specific responses to 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>gigantea</italic> exposure.
