<p>Interestingly, no fungal lesions were observed on the three native plant species in the absence of competition despite seven days of incubation inside plastic bags. The absence of visible symptoms, however, does not necessarily indicate a lack of infection. For example, some fungi are asymptomatic endophytes of invasive Crofton weed (
 <italic>Ageratina adenophora</italic>) but cause visible leaf spots on co-occurring plant species [
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Fungal lesions were observed on some native plants grown with 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic>, perhaps because 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> biomass altered the microclimate of the pots (e.g., increased humidity), which can be more suitable for lesion formation [
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In addition, transmission from 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> to native plants may have maintained infections. Indeed, 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>gigantea</italic> transmission from more competent host species to less competent host species has been inferred from field observations [
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. If 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> biomass amplifies 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>gigantea</italic> incidence on native species in the field, 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>gigantea</italic> could drive apparent competition between 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> and species negatively affected by
