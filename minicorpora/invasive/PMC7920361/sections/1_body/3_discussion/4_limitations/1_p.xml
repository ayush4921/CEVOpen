<p>Experimentally suppressing 
 <italic>Bipolaris</italic> infection using fungicide in the field increased 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> biomass by 33â€“39% [
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], suggesting substantial effects of severe disease symptom development. However, despite using a pathogenic 
 <italic>Bipolaris</italic> isolate in our experiment [
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], inoculation caused low levels of disease incidence (relative to approximately 40% of leaves with lesions documented in the field, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0237894.s003">S2 Table</xref>), which had no effect on 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> biomass relative to the mock inoculation control. While such results could be explained by 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> tolerance or compensatory growth [
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], it is more parsimonious to assume that 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>gigantea</italic> exposure was below levels experienced in the field. Pathogen transmission and disease incidence depend on the favorability and duration of environmental conditions and the inoculum load [
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Our experiment relied on a single inoculation and extended incubation; however, field conditions that result in cycles of leaf wetness events (e.g., dew or precipitation) can enhance fungal infection [
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] and promote multiple disease cycles throughout the growing season. The concentration of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>gigantea</italic> conidia in our experimental inoculations was limited by the number of conidia we could harvest from agar plates in the lab and was relatively low (15,000 conidia/ml compared to e.g., 10
 <sup>5</sup> conidia/ml [
 <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]). While the conditions for leaf wetness and conidia suspension concentration likely limited the possible extent of disease incidence, they may reflect initial disease dynamics in the field, which is consistent with the age of plants we used in the experiment.
