<p>Although we did not test plants for infection with 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>gigantea</italic> infection following the experiment, our results indicate that observed lesions and biomass effects were likely due to the 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>gigantea</italic> inoculation treatment. Only a single pot in the mock inoculation treatment exhibited disease symptoms while 94% of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>gigantea</italic>â€“inoculated pots with 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> (
 <italic>n</italic> = 48) displayed disease symptoms. In addition, a relatively high number of leaves in the one mock-inoculated pot had lesions. These two results suggest that the pot was inadvertently inoculated when treatments were applied. An alternative explanation is that the one mock-inoculated pot was contaminated (e.g., seeds harbored pathogenic fungi or external contaminants were introduced). While either is a possibility, the latter does not explain the much higher percentage of inoculated pots with lesions relative to mock-inoculated pots. In addition, 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>gigantea</italic> can co-occur with other pathogens in the field (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0237894.s004">S3 Table</xref>). Therefore, infection of plants in our experiment that is not confounded with the inoculation treatment does not negate our ability to evaluate the effects of the inoculated 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>gigantea</italic> strain on competition between native plants and 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic>. Future efforts that aim to better characterize host-pathogen interactions between 
 <italic>Microstegium</italic> or native plant species and 
 <italic>Bipolaris</italic> fungi could confirm infection by attempting to re-isolate the fungus after inoculation.
