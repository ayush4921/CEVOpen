<p>Reviewer #2:Â Manuscirpt by Kendig et al investigates the impact of fungal pathogen Bipolaris on one invasive grass Microstegium vimineum in North America as well as on three native grasses, Dichanthelium clandestinum Elymus virginicus, and Eragrostis spectabilis. In addition their aim was to test how pathogen impacts on the competition between the plant species. The experimental design includes the three separate native grass species treatments alone and in different densities of invasive grass and Bipolaris inoculation and mock inoculations in greenhouse. The authors find that the pathogen has minor effect on the biomass of the native grasses in the absence of the invasive grass but the invasive grass has overall larger negative impact on the native grasses than the pathogen. However, there are major methodological issues that must be addressed before being able to evaluate the manuscript further:</p>
