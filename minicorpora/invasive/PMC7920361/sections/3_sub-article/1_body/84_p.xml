<p>Reviewer #3: The research article ‘Emerging fungal pathogen on an invasive grass differentially affects native species’ documents a well-planned experimental examination of the effects on three native grasses (Dichanthelium, Elymus and Eragrotis) of an invasive grass, Microstegium vimineum, in the presence of a fungal pathogen, Bipolaris gigantea. The manuscript is well written. Results show that the density of the invasive grass has effects on the native grasses that overwhelms any effect of the presence of the pathogen on either the invasive grass itself or the native grasses. Some differential effects of the fungus on the native grasses is observed, however infection patterns across individuals suggest that the inoculation protocol failed at some level – indeed the authors concede that conidial concentrations of the inoculum were low, perhaps by several orders of magnitude. I believe more needs to be said about the efficacy of the inoculation procedure. A more thorough discussion concerning the differential direct effects of the fungus on the native grasses that were infected would be welcome.</p>
