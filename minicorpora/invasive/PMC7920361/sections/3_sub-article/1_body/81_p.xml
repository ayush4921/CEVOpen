<p>Main problems: First, the authors do not soundly establish that the three Native grasses are susceptible for Bipolaris. This should be done by either referencing previous literature that explicitly shows that, in ref 24 Flory et al 2014 show that Elymus is susceptible to some strains of Bipolaris but not all of them. I did not find the other two grass species in the refs 24, 27, 32, 33. Or, alternatively by performing a laboratory trial on with the strain in concern and with all the native species and then using the strain in the experiment. Or, by taking the leaf samples from the plants used in the experiment, performing microscopy, growing the pathogen isolate on growth media plates and identification from them, or by PCR from the infected leaf tissue. None of these approaches is currently taken.</p>
