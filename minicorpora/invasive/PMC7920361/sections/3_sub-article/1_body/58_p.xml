<p>It is safe to assume that the authors did not perform preliminary studies to determine if the pathogen could infect the native plants used in this study. L89 -93, the author explicitly mentions that because the native plants occur with the invasive, they assumed the natives were susceptible. The study would have actually benefited from screening, testing, and using susceptible natives. This is an interesting pilot study. An interesting result that might be worthy of explaining is the different outcome that Bipolaris had on 3 different native plants.</p>
