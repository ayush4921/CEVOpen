<p>I apologize for the delay in returning my decision to you. The reviews are mixed, with two reviewers recommending rejection and one recommending minor revision. I deeply respect and agree with all the reviewer's concerns about this paper, but I am willing to reconsider a revised version of the manuscript if the serious flaws noted by all three reviewers can be satisfactorily addressed. However, a revised version that does not adequately address their concerns will be rejected. Serious concerns to be addressed include, but are no limited to, questions about disease incidence/ severity, major issues regarding the methodology used, and a need to expand upon the inoculation procedure.</p>
