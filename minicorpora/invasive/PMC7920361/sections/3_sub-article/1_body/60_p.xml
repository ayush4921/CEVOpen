<p>As for the results section, the authors do not provide a P-values, but report significance via supplementary table, where 95% CI does not intersect zero. Truthfully, this is my first time reading a manuscript without a reported p value. The readers will find it odd that the results section does not mention a p value. values need to be included</p>
