<p>It is possible, although we think unlikely, that Microstegium transmitted a seedborne endophyte to the native plants, which caused their lesions. However, native plants only formed lesions following B. gigantea inoculation, not mock inoculation. This result would suggest that the B. gigantea inoculation increased the chances of lesions forming due to the seedborne endophyte. Because the B. gigantea inoculation treatment only differed from the mock inoculation treatment in that B. gigantea spores were present, this suggests that B. gigantea alone mediated the plantâ€“endophyte interaction. While that may have occurred, it is far more parsimonious that B. gigantea itself caused the lesions. </p>
