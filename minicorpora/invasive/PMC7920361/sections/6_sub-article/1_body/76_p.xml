<p>If in fact B. gigantea mediated a plant–endophyte interaction, we would expect to see a similar interaction play out in the field (Microstegium seeds were collected from the field), making our results still relevant for the ecological interactions of the species. While we do not address this specific case in the Discussion, we acknowledge the potential roles of seedborne pathogens, contamination, and co-occurrence of multiple pathogens (Lines 442–457).</p>
