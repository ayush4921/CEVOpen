<p>We acknowledge Reviewer 1â€™s concern that we did not confirm the susceptibility of two of the three native species to B. gigantea prior to the experiment. We addressed this limitation by revising the text to more clearly acknowledge that we did not test plants for infection following the experiment and by presenting all of our results in the context of experimental inoculation. In addition, to guide readers in interpreting the results of the experiment, we made a series of changes to the manuscript, which we outline below in our response to Reviewer 1.</p>
