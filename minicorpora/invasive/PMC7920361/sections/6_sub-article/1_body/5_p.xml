<p>We designed our experiment with a control treatment and an inoculation treatment, where plants only differed in whether or not they were exposed to Bipolaris gigantea spores. We believe this design allows for interpretation within the context of B. gigantea inoculation. We acknowledge that the experiment would have been strengthened by examining leaves for spores, and potentially re-isolating Bipolaris prior to oven-drying the material. We did not perform this step for this experiment due to time limitations (this was a summer undergraduate research project), the absence of lesions on mock-inoculated plants, and our confidence in the B. gigantea isolation and inoculation method.</p>
