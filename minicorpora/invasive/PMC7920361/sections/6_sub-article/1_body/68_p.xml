<p>I acknowledge the authors explanation that the invasive competitor may have increased humidity (L413), which may have influenced disease symptoms on native plants, but it still seems like a bit of stretch. The authors should have confirmed that the pathogen can infect native plants, as part of a preliminary study or experimental design. This careful approach, would have allowed the authors to determine if humidity was a factor affecting susceptibility among native plants. Humidity could have easily been manipulated by confining the plantâ€™s air-space with a plastic dome cover, or an autoclave bag, while exposing plants to Bipolaris. This approach is common in plant pathology cases that address foliar pathogens that infect via stomata. As it stands, the authors can only speculate if humidity was a factor.</p>
