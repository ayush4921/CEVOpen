<p>In this study, the authors address plant competition and plant pathogen infection. However, if the authors truly believe their study can stand without confirming that the native plants are susceptible to Bipolaris, then perhaps the authors should omit all text about Bipolaris infecting native plants. Currently, Line 276 says “Bipolaris gigantea inoculation resulted in lesions on all three native plant species, but only in the presence of Microstegium”. This statement cannot be made with confidence, the authors do not know if those lesions were caused by Bipolaris. Similar statements appear throughout the text (i.e L 333), and raises concern.</p>
