<p>These definitions are consistent with the plant pathology literature and are the ones we applied to our study. Therefore, the phrase “Bipolaris gigantea inoculation” is the most accurate description of the experimental treatment. Plants were inoculated with B. gigantea spores suspended in sterile deionized water with 0.1% Tween 20 or with a control (sterile deionized water with 0.1% Tween 20) that lacked B. gigantea spores (Lines 153–162). </p>
