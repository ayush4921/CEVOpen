<p>We determined that B. gigantea can infect E. virginicus in a previous study (Lane et al. 2020, reference #35) and we acknowledge that we did not test the susceptibility of D. clandestinum and E. spectabilis to B. gigantea. We aimed to be transparent with readers about our a priori knowledge of their potential susceptibility (Lines 93â€“98). </p>
