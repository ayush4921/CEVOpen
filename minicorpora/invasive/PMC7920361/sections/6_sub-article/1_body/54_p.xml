<p>We understand your point but disagree. Bos and Parlevliet (1995) define inoculation as, “the ‘application of microorganisms or virus particles to a host or into a culture medium’ (28, 36), or, better, ‘the transfer of material containing a parasite or its propagules (a) into or onto tissues of an organism to initiate infection, (b) into or onto a culture medium for propagation’ (21). It is a human activity, even when vectors are used for transfer.” </p>
