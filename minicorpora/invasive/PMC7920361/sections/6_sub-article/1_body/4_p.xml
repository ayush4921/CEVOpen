<p>One suggestion to address the issue of confirming Bipolaris infection was to go back to the dried biomass plant samples and attempt to isolate Bipolaris. However, the plant tissue from the experiment has all been oven-dried and stored in a laboratory for over a year. Although we can attempt to rehydrate the tissue and examine lesions for Bipolaris gigantea spores, the absence of spores would not indicate that the plants were not infected because oven-drying may have destroyed them. We also do not believe that infection of plants in a secondary experiment would confirm infection of plants in the focal experiment. However, we do reference Lane et al. 2020 in our manuscript, which used Microstegium vimineum and Elymus virginicus seeds from the same source used for our experiment, inoculated plants with B. gigantea using nearly identical methods to those used for our experiment, and reisolated B. gigantea spores from lesions on the plants. </p>
