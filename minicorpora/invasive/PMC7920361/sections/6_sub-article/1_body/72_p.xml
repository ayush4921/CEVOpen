<p>In conclusion, the mere fact that the authors did not determine if Bipolaris can infect the native plants raises concern. It is possible that the lesions may not be from Bipolaris. It may be possible the invasive carries a seedborne endophyte, that is asymptomatic in the invasive, but when transmitted, causes symptoms on the natives, and this endophyte may not be Bipolaris.</p>
