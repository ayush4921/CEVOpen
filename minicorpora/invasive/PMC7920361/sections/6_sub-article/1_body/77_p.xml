<p>We did not have sufficient data to test the effects of Microstegium density on native plant disease incidence and we describe the effects of Microstegium density on native plant lesions as trends (Lines 282â€“285). We do not want to mislead readers in our certainty that Microstegium is necessary for lesions to form on the native species. There were multiple cases in which Microstegium was present and lesions did not form. Therefore, we revised the Results text as follows:</p>
