 <caption> Native plant biomass. The biomass of (A) Dichanthelium, (B) Elymus, and (C) Eragrostis across the Microstegium density gradient following B. gigantea or mock inoculation. Main plots show observations (points and error bars, mean ± 95% confidence intervals) and model fits (lines and shaded ribbons, mean ± 95% credible intervals). Inset plots show the model-estimated biomass in the absence of competition (b 0) and the biomass responses to Microstegium density (α) (mean ± 95% credible intervals). </caption>
