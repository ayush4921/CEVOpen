 <caption> Experimental methods. (A) A diagram of the experimental design, (B) an example of the realized Microstegium density gradient (with Dichanthelium as the native species), and (C) an example of Bipolaris-like lesions on a Microstegium leaf from the experiment. Circles in A represent 1 L pots, with “N” indicating the central position of the native plant and the intensity of green shading indicating the Microstegium density (planted density values labelled below pots). Each represented pot was replicated four times. </caption>
