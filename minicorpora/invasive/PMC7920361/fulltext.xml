For example, disease can modify resource competition between invasive and native species. Invasive species tend to interact with a diversity of native species, and it is unclear how native species differ in response to disease-mediated competition with invasive species. Here, we quantified the biomass responses of three native North American grass species (<italic>Dichanthelium clandestinum</italic>, <italic>Elymus virginicus</italic>, and <italic>Eragrostis spectabilis)</italic> to disease-mediated competition with the non-native invasive grass <italic>Microstegium vimineum</italic>. The foliar fungal pathogen <italic>Bipolaris gigantea</italic> has recently emerged in <italic>Microstegium</italic> populations, causing a leaf spot disease that reduces <italic>Microstegium</italic> biomass and seed production. In a greenhouse experiment, we examined the effects of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>gigantea</italic> inoculation on two components of competitive ability for each native species: growth in the absence of competition and biomass responses to increasing densities of <italic>Microstegium</italic>. <italic>Bipolaris gigantea</italic> inoculation affected each of the three native species in unique ways, by increasing (<italic>Dichanthelium</italic>), decreasing (<italic>Elymus</italic>), or not changing (<italic>Eragrostis</italic>) their growth in the absence of competition relative to mock inoculation. <italic>Bipolaris gigantea</italic> inoculation did not, however, affect <italic>Microstegium</italic> biomass or mediate the effect of <italic>Microstegium</italic> density on native plant biomass. Thus, <italic>B</italic>. <italic>gigantea</italic> had species-specific effects on native plant competition with <italic>Microstegium</italic> through species-specific biomass responses to <italic>B</italic>. <italic>gigantea</italic> inoculation, but not through modified responses to <italic>Microstegium</italic> density. Our results suggest that disease may uniquely modify competitive interactions between invasive and native plants for different native plant species.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>USDA-NSF-NIH Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases program</institution></funding-source><award-id>2017-67013-26870</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Flory</surname><given-names>S.

Invasive species and disease outbreaks can co-occur in communities because the species are co-introduced, or because invasive species amplify disease transmission [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Invasive plants can negatively impact native plant communities through competition [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and diseases may increase, decrease, or have no net effect on invasive plant impacts [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The responses of both the invasive species and competing native species to infection can determine which of these outcomes occurs [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. For example, infected invasive plants are predicted to have lower competitive effects than uninfected invasive plants when native species have greater disease resistance or tolerance [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In empirical and theoretical tests of disease-mediated competition between a single native plant species and a single invasive plant species, disease has both increased [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and decreased [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] impacts of the invasive species. However, the relevant guild of native species in natural communities is often diverse and species vary in their susceptibility to pathogen infection [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], making it unclear whether results from studies of disease-mediated competition with one native species apply to the broader native community.</p><p>A shared pathogen can create an antagonistic interaction between two or more host species (i.e., apparent competition), even in the absence of other forms of interaction, such as resource competition [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Increases in the abundance of one host species can decrease the fitness of another through transmission and the negative effects of disease [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Invasive species may enhance pathogen transmission to or disease impacts on native species [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. For example, high densities of invasive cheatgrass (<italic>Bromus tectorum</italic>) promoted infection of native plant seeds by a fungal pathogen [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Pathogen infection of native or invasive plants can reduce growth, reproduction, and survival [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], as well as induce compensatory growth or reproduction [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Because disease can influence the productivity and composition of natural plant communities [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], disease amplification by invasive plants could have potentially strong effects on native plant communities [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Disease can modify the effects of plants on shared resources and their responses to resource limitation [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. For example, disease-induced reductions in total leaf area can decrease light interception [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], potentially increasing light availability to lower canopy levels and decreasing photosynthesis of infected plants. If disease disproportionately impacts invasive species, reductions in growth and resource uptake may release native species from competition, which was reported when a powdery mildew fungus infected invasive garlic mustard (<italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In contrast, disease-induced fitness costs may reduce the competitive ability of native species, which is hypothesized to have promoted invasion of European grasses in California [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].

Fungal colonies grew under 12 h day and night fluorescent light at 26&#x000b0;C for one week and were transferred to new half-strength V8 media agar plates. Conidia were harvested from fungal colonies by flooding plates with 10 ml of sterile deionized water with 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The resulting conidia suspension was filtered through a layer of cheese cloth, and conidia were quantified with a Spencer Bright-Line hemocytometer (American Optical Company, Buffalo, NY, USA). The concentration of inoculum was adjusted to 15,000 conidia/ml and applied to plants with a Passche H-202S airbrush sprayer (Kenosha, WI, USA). Inoculations occurred six days after planting the native species with the <italic>Microstegium</italic>, and half of the pots were sprayed until runoff with the spore suspension while the other half were sprayed with the same volume of sterile deionized water with 0.1% Tween 20 (i.e., mock inoculation control).

However, in our experiment, inoculation with <italic>Bipolaris</italic> did not modify the effect of <italic>Microstegium</italic> density on the three native species relative to the mock inoculation control, suggesting that competitive effects of <italic>Microstegium</italic> on native species are likely to be consistent in the presence or absence of low levels of disease incidence. Our experimental design captured two components of native species&#x02019; competitive ability: their growth in the absence of competition and their biomass responses to changes in <italic>Microstegium</italic> density (i.e., interspecific competition coefficients) [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. To better characterize the competitive ability of the native species, it is also necessary to estimate their biomass responses to changes in their own density (i.e., intraspecific competition coefficients) [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Because <italic>B</italic>. <italic>gigantea</italic> inoculation had unique effects on the growth of the three native species, it may also uniquely affect their per capita impacts on competitor growth, altering their intraspecific competition coefficients. If, however, <italic>B</italic>. <italic>gigantea</italic> does not affect the intraspecific competition coefficients of the native species, we would expect low levels of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>gigantea</italic> exposure to increase the competitive ability of <italic>Dichanthelium</italic> in interactions with <italic>Microstegium</italic>, decrease the competitive ability of <italic>Elymus</italic>, and to have no effect on the competitive ability of <italic>Eragrostis</italic>, potentially leading to shifts in the relative abundances of native species. Predicting the long-term outcome of disease impacts on native&#x02013;invasive interactions requires also understanding the invasive species&#x02019; competitive ability and niche overlap between the native and invasive species (e.g., overlapping resource requirements or natural enemies) [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Because the native species are perennial and the invasive species is an annual, studies that examine the effects of disease on aspects of plant fitness other than biomass, for example, annual seed survival and perennial adult survival, are necessary for characterizing the comprehensive impacts of disease on native&#x02013;invasive plant competition [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p><p>Our experimental methods and conditions may have limited the levels of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>gigantea</italic> leaf spot disease (see Limitations section), and there were no effects of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>gigantea</italic> inoculation on <italic>Microstegium</italic> biomass, likely leading to limited changes in <italic>Microstegium</italic> resource acquisition. Therefore, it is crucial to explore disease-mediated competitive effects of <italic>Microstegium</italic> in the field or with methods that may result in disease incidence approaching levels observed in the field. For example, disease incidence on <italic>Microstegium</italic> decreased as <italic>Microstegium</italic> densities increased, which is likely because the single <italic>B</italic>. <italic>gigantea</italic> inoculation infected a relatively constant number of leaves regardless of <italic>Microstegium</italic> density, leading to lower percentages of leaves with lesions at higher densities. In contrast, higher plant densities in the field may promote higher disease incidence and greater inoculum production [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], in which case disease may have stronger impacts on <italic>Microstegium</italic> competition than what we observed in the experiment. Greater <italic>B</italic>. <italic>gigantea</italic> inoculum levels and multiple disease cycles may also have larger effects on native plant responses to competition, for example, through reduced ability to capture resources [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Nonetheless, the impacts of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>gigantea</italic> on <italic>Microstegium</italic> and native plant competition may simply be minor, as has been demonstrated for disease effects on cheatgrass competition [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and herbivory effects on Amur honeysuckle (<italic>Lonicera maackii</italic>) competition with native species [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In that case, competitive effects of the invasive plant on native species are likely to overshadow the effects of disease, which may be common across plant communities [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Consequences of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>gigantea</italic> inoculation</title><p>It is likely that pathogen amplification by invasive plants has distinct effects on different native species [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The three native species in our experiment showed unique biomass responses to <italic>B</italic>. <italic>gigantea</italic> inoculation in the absence of <italic>Microstegium</italic> competition. The range of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>gigantea</italic> inoculation effects on biomass, from negative (on <italic>Elymus</italic>) to positive (on <italic>Dichanthelium</italic>) is consistent with the theory that plant-microbe interactions can vary from mutualism to parasitism depending on context, such as environmental conditions and host identity [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. For example, infection with Cucumber mosaic virus increased the biomass and seed weight of one <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> genotype while it reduced the biomass and seed weight of another genotype relative to a mock inoculation control [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Our results suggest that <italic>B</italic>. <italic>gigantea</italic> could increase aboveground growth for some host species (e.g., through compensatory growth or re-allocation of resources [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]) and suppress the aboveground growth of other species. Studies encompassing a broader range of environmental conditions and host diversity are needed to better predict when <italic>B</italic>. <italic>gigantea</italic> will have positive, negative, or neutral effects on host biomass and other traits. In studies of soil microbes, the effects of microbial inoculations on plant growth can predict plant species relative abundances in the field [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. However, whether disease-induced changes in growth of plant species, as observed in our study, are sufficient to shift plant community structure is an important area of future research [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, no fungal lesions were observed on the three native plant species in the absence of competition despite seven days of incubation inside plastic bags. The absence of visible symptoms, however, does not necessarily indicate a lack of infection. For example, some fungi are asymptomatic endophytes of invasive Crofton weed (<italic>Ageratina adenophora</italic>) but cause visible leaf spots on co-occurring plant species [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Fungal lesions were observed on some native plants grown with <italic>Microstegium</italic>, perhaps because <italic>Microstegium</italic> biomass altered the microclimate of the pots (e.g., increased humidity), which can be more suitable for lesion formation [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In addition, transmission from <italic>Microstegium</italic> to native plants may have maintained infections. Indeed, <italic>B</italic>. <italic>gigantea</italic> transmission from more competent host species to less competent host species has been inferred from field observations [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. If <italic>Microstegium</italic> biomass amplifies <italic>B</italic>. <italic>gigantea</italic> incidence on native species in the field, <italic>B</italic>. <italic>gigantea</italic> could drive apparent competition between <italic>Microstegium</italic> and species negatively affected by <italic>B</italic>. <italic>gigantea</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Limitations</title><p>Experimentally suppressing <italic>Bipolaris</italic> infection using fungicide in the field increased <italic>Microstegium</italic> biomass by 33&#x02013;39% [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], suggesting substantial effects of severe disease symptom development. However, despite using a pathogenic <italic>Bipolaris</italic> isolate in our experiment [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], inoculation caused low levels of disease incidence (relative to approximately 40% of leaves with lesions documented in the field, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0237894.s003">S2 Table</xref>), which had no effect on <italic>Microstegium</italic> biomass relative to the mock inoculation control.

Pathogen transmission and disease incidence depend on the favorability and duration of environmental conditions and the inoculum load [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0237894.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Our experiment relied on a single inoculation and extended incubation; however, field conditions that result in cycles of leaf wetness events (e.g., dew or precipitation) can enhance fungal infection [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] and promote multiple disease cycles throughout the growing season. The concentration of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>gigantea</italic> conidia in our experimental inoculations was limited by the number of conidia we could harvest from agar plates in the lab and was relatively low (15,000 conidia/ml compared to e.g., 10<sup>5</sup> conidia/ml [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]). While the conditions for leaf wetness and conidia suspension concentration likely limited the possible extent of disease incidence, they may reflect initial disease dynamics in the field, which is consistent with the age of plants we used in the experiment.</p><p>Although we did not test plants for infection with <italic>B</italic>. <italic>gigantea</italic> infection following the experiment, our results indicate that observed lesions and biomass effects were likely due to the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>gigantea</italic> inoculation treatment. Only a single pot in the mock inoculation treatment exhibited disease symptoms while 94% of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>gigantea</italic>&#x02013;inoculated pots with <italic>Microstegium</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 48) displayed disease symptoms. In addition, a relatively high number of leaves in the one mock-inoculated pot had lesions. These two results suggest that the pot was inadvertently inoculated when treatments were applied. An alternative explanation is that the one mock-inoculated pot was contaminated (e.g., seeds harbored pathogenic fungi or external contaminants were introduced). While either is a possibility, the latter does not explain the much higher percentage of inoculated pots with lesions relative to mock-inoculated pots. In addition, <italic>B</italic>. <italic>gigantea</italic> can co-occur with other pathogens in the field (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0237894.s004">S3 Table</xref>). Therefore, infection of plants in our experiment that is not confounded with the inoculation treatment does not negate our ability to evaluate the effects of the inoculated <italic>B</italic>. <italic>gigantea</italic> strain on competition between native plants and <italic>Microstegium</italic>. Future efforts that aim to better characterize host-pathogen interactions between <italic>Microstegium</italic> or native plant species and <italic>Bipolaris</italic> fungi could confirm infection by attempting to re-isolate the fungus after inoculation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec011"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We used a greenhouse experiment to demonstrate that inoculation with a fungal leaf spot pathogen that has accumulated on a widespread invasive grass had unique effects on the growth of native species but did not modify biomass responses of native species to <italic>Microstegium</italic> density. Complementary experiments in the field could help determine whether these findings are consistent across other native species and when disease pressure is higher. Transmission of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>gigantea</italic> may depend on <italic>Microstegium</italic> densities, potentially creating feedbacks between infection and density, which we controlled for in our experiment. The competitive effects of native plant species on <italic>Microstegium</italic> in the presence and absence of disease also may be important for understanding long-term community dynamics [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The emergence of infectious diseases in invaded plant communities may lead to natural biological control of the invasive species [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], exacerbated effects of invasion if the pathogen negatively impacts native species [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], or there may be no effect of disease [<xref rid="pone.0237894.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].

</p><p>PONE-D-20-23926</p><p>Emerging fungal pathogen on an invasive grass differentially affects native species</p><p>PLOS ONE</p><p>Dear Dr. Kendig,</p><p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#x02019;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p><p>I apologize for the delay in returning my&#x000a0;decision to you. The reviews are mixed, with two reviewers recommending rejection and one recommending minor revision. I deeply respect and agree with all the reviewer's concerns about this paper, but I am willing to reconsider a revised version of the manuscript if the serious flaws noted by all&#x000a0;three reviewers can be satisfactorily addressed. However, a revised version that does not adequately address their concerns will be rejected. Serious concerns to be addressed include, but are no limited to, questions about disease incidence/&#x000a0;severity, major issues regarding the methodology used, and a need to expand upon the&#x000a0;inoculation procedure.</p><p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Dec 07 2020 11:59PM. If you will need more time than this to complete your revisions, please reply to this message or contact the journal office at <email>plosone@plos.org</email>. When you're ready to submit your revision, log on to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link> and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.</p><p>Please include the following items when submitting your revised manuscript:</p><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A rebuttal letter that responds to each point raised by the academic editor and reviewer(s). You should upload this letter as a separate file labeled 'Response to Reviewers'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A marked-up copy of your manuscript that highlights changes made to the original version. You should upload this as a separate file labeled 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>An unmarked version of your revised paper without tracked changes. You should upload this as a separate file labeled 'Manuscript'.</p></list-item></list></p><p>If you would like to make changes to your financial disclosure, please include your updated statement in your cover letter. Guidelines for resubmitting your figure files are available below the reviewer comments at the end of this letter.</p><p>If applicable, we recommend that you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io to enhance the reproducibility of your results. Protocols.io assigns your protocol its own identifier (DOI) so that it can be cited independently in the future.

This deserve some explanation. How does an invasive plant make native plants more susceptible to pathogen?</p><p>According to the authors, L177: &#x02018;There were too few native plants with lesions. With that being said, how can the authors speculate the following at Line 268: &#x02018;These results suggest that disease caused by Bipolaris may alter the community composition of native species. This claim seems farfetched and unsupported, since &#x02018;there were too few native plants with lesions. The authors report disease incidence at Line 209 -213, and then provide an explanation that is not intuitive. The results are reported as &#x02018;disease incidence&#x02019;, but then authors explain disease severity. Disease incidence is should be per plant/individual. Disease severity should be per leaves.</p><p>It is safe to assume that the authors did not perform preliminary studies to determine if the pathogen could infect the native plants used in this study. L89 -93, the author explicitly mentions that because the native plants occur with the invasive, they assumed the natives were susceptible. The study would have actually benefited from screening, testing, and using susceptible natives. This is an interesting pilot study. An interesting result that might be worthy of explaining is the different outcome that Bipolaris had on 3 different native plants.</p><p>According to table S1, Microstegium disease incidence decreased as microstegium density increased. As mentioned before the explanation needs more insight.</p><p>As for the results section, the authors do not provide a P-values, but report significance via supplementary table, where 95% CI does not intersect zero. Truthfully, this is my first time reading a manuscript without a reported p value. The readers will find it odd that the results section does not mention a p value. values need to be included</p><p>&#x02003;</p><p>Minor Comments</p><p>Line 21: After mentioning &#x02018;North American grass species. I recommend adding a parenthesis and naming the native grass species.</p><p>Line 22: Hard stop, add period after Bipolaris gigantea. Now make a new sentence.</p><p>i.e This foliar pathogen has recently emerged in populations of the invasive grass Microstegium vimineum, causing leaf spot disease</p><p>Line 28: Remove: &#x0201c;inoculation treatment&#x0201d;. Replace with &#x0201c;pathogen outcome&#x0201d;</p><p>Line 29: Remove: &#x0201c;suggesting that disease had no indirect effects through altered competition&#x02019;</p><p>ADD: &#x0201c;suggesting that pathogen outcome did not alter competition&#x0201d;:</p><p>Line 38: Replace &#x0201c;afflict&#x0201d; with &#x02018;perturb&#x02019;</p><p>Line 41 &#x02013; 42: This is unclear because plant invasions are a spatiotemporal process that stems from (1) transport, (2) colonization, (3) establishment, and (4) landscape spread(Theoharides and Dukes, 2007), but It appears as if the author is using plant introduction synonymous with plant invasion. How is community structure being maintained, if an invasion suggests altered community structure</p><p>Line 43: This is unclear: &#x0201c;suppressing native species that would either driver on its own&#x0201d;.</p><p>Line 44: This sentence is unclear. Perhaps avoid starting a sentence with a conjunction (i.e &#x0201c;Which&#x0201d;), and it will be easier for the reader to understand</p><p>Line 45 &#x02013; 47: This line can be more precise. Also, it seems untimely because at Line 41 -44 an example is given of &#x02018;disease and plant invasion&#x02019;. Line 45 &#x02013; 47 is saying the same thing again. Only difference is in Line 41 -44 the reader is told the potential outcome of &#x02018;disease and plant invasion&#x02019;, and in Line 45 &#x02013; 47 the outcome is vague but with more references.</p><p>Line 62: Replace: &#x0201c;occurred&#x0201d; with &#x0201c;was reported&#x0201d;</p><p>Line 70: Formally introduce the pathogen. Mentioning that an anonymous pathogen suppresses growth and reproduction and providing two reference seems to be a stating the obvious. In general, there are some references in this section, without the thought or example being fully defines</p><p>Line 92 - 93: Pathogen is formally mentioned, but there isn&#x02019;t any mention of symptoms, or how it spreads. Also, the authors mention that the native grass species maybe to susceptible to Bipolaris, but due to the nature of this study, it seems a preliminary test to confirm susceptibility would have been helpful</p><p>L209 -213: A disease incidence is presence or absence of disease on a particular plant. However, the author seems to report disease incidence, and then gives a disease severity interpretation (i.e leaves with lesions)</p><p>L211 -213: Interpretation should be explained in the discussion</p><p>THEOHARIDES, K. A. &#x00026; DUKES, J. S. 2007. Plant invasion across space and time: factors affecting nonindigenous species success during four stages of invasion. New phytologist, 176, 256-273.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;Manuscirpt by Kendig et al investigates the impact of fungal pathogen Bipolaris on one invasive grass Microstegium vimineum in North America as well as on three native grasses, Dichanthelium clandestinum Elymus virginicus, and Eragrostis spectabilis. In addition their aim was to test how pathogen impacts on the competition between the plant species. The experimental design includes the three separate native grass species treatments alone and in different densities of invasive grass and Bipolaris inoculation and mock inoculations in greenhouse. The authors find that the pathogen has minor effect on the biomass of the native grasses in the absence of the invasive grass but the invasive grass has overall larger negative impact on the native grasses than the pathogen. However, there are major methodological issues that must be addressed before being able to evaluate the manuscript further:</p><p>Main problems: First, the authors do not soundly establish that the three Native grasses are susceptible for Bipolaris. This should be done by either referencing previous literature that explicitly shows that, in ref 24 Flory et al 2014 show that Elymus is susceptible to some strains of Bipolaris but not all of them. I did not find the other two grass species in the refs 24, 27, 32, 33. Or, alternatively by performing a laboratory trial on with the strain in concern and with all the native species and then using the strain in the experiment. Or, by taking the leaf samples from the plants used in the experiment, performing microscopy, growing the pathogen isolate on growth media plates and identification from them, or by PCR from the infected leaf tissue. None of these approaches is currently taken.</p><p>Second, the authors have not discussed the possibility that the symptoms in the study plants are caused by another pathogen, potentially from seed (again, lack of any detection methods in the experiment).</p><p>Third, Bipolaris infection found in the pathogen treated and mock inoculated plants (l. 158-160) may be seedborne. This should have be established by using pathogen free seed, testing all plant material after germination prior experiment for Bipolaris by PCR, or by testing mock inoculated plants with PCR in the end of the experiment.</p><p>Reviewer #3:&#x000a0;The research article &#x02018;Emerging fungal pathogen on an invasive grass differentially affects native species&#x02019; documents a well-planned experimental examination of the effects on three native grasses (Dichanthelium, Elymus and Eragrotis) of an invasive grass, Microstegium vimineum, in the presence of a fungal pathogen, Bipolaris gigantea. The manuscript is well written. Results show that the density of the invasive grass has effects on the native grasses that overwhelms any effect of the presence of the pathogen on either the invasive grass itself or the native grasses. Some differential effects of the fungus on the native grasses is observed, however infection patterns across individuals suggest that the inoculation protocol failed at some level &#x02013; indeed the authors concede that conidial concentrations of the inoculum were low, perhaps by several orders of magnitude. I believe more needs to be said about the efficacy of the inoculation procedure. A more thorough discussion concerning the differential direct effects of the fungus on the native grasses that were infected would be welcome.</p><p>Detailed comments:</p><p>Line 38. &#x02018;affect&#x02019; not &#x02018;afflict&#x02019;</p><p>Line 88. infections &#x02018;with&#x02019; species not &#x02018;from&#x02019;</p><p>Line 101. plastics &#x02018;bags&#x02019; not &#x02018;bag&#x02019;</p><p>Line 138. &#x02018;hemocytometer&#x02019; (or haemocytometer) not &#x02018;hemacytometer&#x02019;</p><p>Line 165. incidence &#x02018;on&#x02019; plants not &#x02018;experienced by&#x02019;</p><p>Line 239.

After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#x02019;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p><p>Reviewer 2 and 3 felt the paper was much improved and have recommended accept. However, reviewer 1 was not satisfied and recommended rejection. The main sticking point is still&#x000a0;the issue with Bipolaris. I wonder if it is possible to recover Bipolaris from&#x000a0;infected lesions, i.e. perform Koch's postulates on a small number of&#x000a0;representative infected leaves? Or, perhaps it is possible to artificially infect some plants with&#x000a0;Bipolaris spores? Otherwise, the authors will need to better convince reviewer 1of the merits of the study as it stands.</p><p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Feb 20 2021 11:59PM.

However, if the authors truly believe their study can stand without confirming that the native plants are susceptible to Bipolaris, then perhaps the authors should omit all text about Bipolaris infecting native plants. Currently, Line 276 says &#x0201c;Bipolaris gigantea inoculation resulted in lesions on all three native plant species, but only in the presence of Microstegium&#x0201d;. This statement cannot be made with confidence, the authors do not know if those lesions were caused by Bipolaris. Similar statements appear throughout the text (i.e L 333), and raises concern.</p><p>I acknowledge the authors explanation that the invasive competitor may have increased humidity (L413), which may have influenced disease symptoms on native plants, but it still seems like a bit of stretch. The authors should have confirmed that the pathogen can infect native plants, as part of a preliminary study or experimental design. This careful approach, would have allowed the authors to determine if humidity was a factor affecting susceptibility among native plants. Humidity could have easily been manipulated by confining the plant&#x02019;s air-space with a plastic dome cover, or an autoclave bag, while exposing plants to Bipolaris. This approach is common in plant pathology cases that address foliar pathogens that infect via stomata. As it stands, the authors can only speculate if humidity was a factor.</p><p>In conclusion, the mere fact that the authors did not determine if Bipolaris can infect the native plants raises concern. It is possible that the lesions may not be from Bipolaris. It may be possible the invasive carries a seedborne endophyte, that is asymptomatic in the invasive, but when transmitted, causes symptoms on the natives, and this endophyte may not be Bipolaris.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;(No Response)</p><p>Reviewer #3:&#x000a0;(No Response)</p><p>**********</p><p>7.

</p><p>Dear Dr. Wilson,</p><p>Thank you for considering a revision of our manuscript, &#x0201c;Emerging fungal pathogen of an invasive grass: Implications for competition with native plant species&#x0201d;. We appreciate the careful attention you and the reviewers have paid to our manuscript, which we believe has resulted in a stronger contribution. </p><p>We acknowledge Reviewer 1&#x02019;s concern that we did not confirm the susceptibility of two of the three native species to B. gigantea prior to the experiment. We addressed this limitation by revising the text to more clearly acknowledge that we did not test plants for infection following the experiment and by presenting all of our results in the context of experimental inoculation. In addition, to guide readers in interpreting the results of the experiment, we made a series of changes to the manuscript, which we outline below in our response to Reviewer 1.</p><p>One suggestion to address the issue of confirming Bipolaris infection was to go back to the dried biomass plant samples and attempt to isolate Bipolaris. However, the plant tissue from the experiment has all been oven-dried and stored in a laboratory for over a year. Although we can attempt to rehydrate the tissue and examine lesions for Bipolaris gigantea spores, the absence of spores would not indicate that the plants were not infected because oven-drying may have destroyed them. We also do not believe that infection of plants in a secondary experiment would confirm infection of plants in the focal experiment. However, we do reference Lane et al. 2020 in our manuscript, which used Microstegium vimineum and Elymus virginicus seeds from the same source used for our experiment, inoculated plants with B. gigantea using nearly identical methods to those used for our experiment, and reisolated B. gigantea spores from lesions on the plants. </p><p>We designed our experiment with a control treatment and an inoculation treatment, where plants only differed in whether or not they were exposed to Bipolaris gigantea spores. We believe this design allows for interpretation within the context of B. gigantea inoculation. We acknowledge that the experiment would have been strengthened by examining leaves for spores, and potentially re-isolating Bipolaris prior to oven-drying the material. We did not perform this step for this experiment due to time limitations (this was a summer undergraduate research project), the absence of lesions on mock-inoculated plants, and our confidence in the B. gigantea isolation and inoculation method.</p><p>Thank you for your consideration,</p><p>Amy Kendig&#x02003;</p><p>Dear Dr. Kendig,</p><p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#x02019;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p><p>Reviewer 2 and 3 felt the paper was much improved and have recommended accept. However, reviewer 1 was not satisfied and recommended rejection. The main sticking point is still the issue with Bipolaris. I wonder if it is possible to recover Bipolaris from infected lesions, i.e. perform Koch's postulates on a small number of representative infected leaves? Or, perhaps it is possible to artificially infect some plants with Bipolaris spores? Otherwise, the authors will need to better convince reviewer 1of the merits of the study as it stands.</p><p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Feb 20 2021 11:59PM.

However, if the authors truly believe their study can stand without confirming that the native plants are susceptible to Bipolaris, then perhaps the authors should omit all text about Bipolaris infecting native plants. Currently, Line 276 says &#x0201c;Bipolaris gigantea inoculation resulted in lesions on all three native plant species, but only in the presence of Microstegium&#x0201d;. This statement cannot be made with confidence, the authors do not know if those lesions were caused by Bipolaris. Similar statements appear throughout the text (i.e L 333), and raises concern.</p><p>We understand your point but disagree. Bos and Parlevliet (1995) define inoculation as, &#x0201c;the &#x02018;application of microorganisms or virus particles to a host or into a culture medium&#x02019; (28, 36), or, better, &#x02018;the transfer of material containing a parasite or its propagules (a) into or onto tissues of an organism to initiate infection, (b) into or onto a culture medium for propagation&#x02019; (21). It is a human activity, even when vectors are used for transfer.&#x0201d; </p><p>They define infection as &#x0201c;the &#x02018;process or state of establishment of a pathogenic microorganism or virus in a living organism&#x02019; (2), or &#x02018;the entry of an organism or virus into a host and the establishment of a permanent or temporary parasitic relationship&#x02019; (28, 36). NPV (21) clearly defined infection as &#x02018;the landing of a pathogen on a host and the initiation of any type of parasitic activity.&#x02019; Infection is thus closely associated with pathogenic activity.&#x0201d; </p><p>These definitions are consistent with the plant pathology literature and are the ones we applied to our study. Therefore, the phrase &#x0201c;Bipolaris gigantea inoculation&#x0201d; is the most accurate description of the experimental treatment. Plants were inoculated with B. gigantea spores suspended in sterile deionized water with 0.1% Tween 20 or with a control (sterile deionized water with 0.1% Tween 20) that lacked B. gigantea spores (Lines 153&#x02013;162). </p><p>Bos L, Parlevliet JE.

Annu Rev Phytopathol. 1995;33: 69&#x02013;102. doi:10.1146/annurev.py.33.090195.000441</p><p>To emphasize that we interpret the results within the context of these two treatments and to differentiate inoculation from infection, we added the following text to the Methods:</p><p>&#x0201c;Because we did not test leaves for infection with B. gigantea following inoculation, we present results in the context of the inoculation treatments rather than infection status.&#x0201d; (Lines 196&#x02013;198)</p><p>In addition, we also revised the text to further emphasize that we interpreted the results within the context of inoculation rather than infection, and that lesions are an approximation of infection, by:</p><p>Changing the title to &#x0201c;Emerging fungal pathogen of an invasive grass: Implications for competition with native plant species&#x0201d;</p><p>Adding the text:</p><p>&#x0201c;We used these visual assessments of Bipolaris-like lesions to approximate B. gigantea infection of experimental plants.&#x0201d; (Lines 186&#x02013;187)</p><p>Removing reference to Elymus &#x0201c;susceptibility&#x0201d; on line 280.</p><p>Adding &#x0201c;inoculation with&#x0201d; to the Discussion text: &#x0201c;We evaluated how inoculation with the emerging fungal pathogen B. gigantea affected the biomasses of three native species in competition with the invasive plant Microstegium.&#x0201d; (Lines 336&#x02013;337).</p><p>Removing the reference to Elymus (as a species negatively affected by B. gigantea) in this Discussion text: &#x0201c;If Microstegium biomass amplifies B. gigantea incidence on native species in the field, B. gigantea could drive apparent competition between Microstegium and species negatively affected by B. gigantea [17].&#x0201d; (Lines 419&#x02013;421)</p><p>Adding &#x0201c;inoculation with&#x0201d; to the Discussion text: &#x0201c;We used a greenhouse experiment to demonstrate that inoculation with a fungal leaf spot pathogen that has accumulated on a widespread invasive grass had unique effects on the growth of native species but did not modify biomass responses of native species to Microstegium density.&#x0201d; (Lines 460&#x02013;463)</p><p>I acknowledge the authors explanation that the invasive competitor may have increased humidity (L413), which may have influenced disease symptoms on native plants, but it still seems like a bit of stretch. The authors should have confirmed that the pathogen can infect native plants, as part of a preliminary study or experimental design. This careful approach, would have allowed the authors to determine if humidity was a factor affecting susceptibility among native plants. Humidity could have easily been manipulated by confining the plant&#x02019;s air-space with a plastic dome cover, or an autoclave bag, while exposing plants to Bipolaris. This approach is common in plant pathology cases that address foliar pathogens that infect via stomata. As it stands, the authors can only speculate if humidity was a factor.</p><p>We agree that it is speculation that native plants had foliar lesions in the presence of Microstegium due to changes in microclimate. As such, we included the word &#x0201c;perhaps&#x0201d; when describing this possible scenario in the Discussion, as well as an alternative scenario (transmission from Microstegium). (Lines 414&#x02013;418)</p><p>Please note that we did in fact place plastic bags over all plants in the experiment for seven days following B. gigantea or mock inoculation treatments to encourage infection (Lines 162&#x02013;164). </p><p>Finally, we did not test the effects of humidity on lesion formation in this experiment explicitly, but we recognize the importance of better understanding this possible mechanism and have therefore addressed this question in recent and forthcoming growth chamber, greenhouse, and field experiments.</p><p>In conclusion, the mere fact that the authors did not determine if Bipolaris can infect the native plants raises concern. It is possible that the lesions may not be from Bipolaris. It may be possible the invasive carries a seedborne endophyte, that is asymptomatic in the invasive, but when transmitted, causes symptoms on the natives, and this endophyte may not be Bipolaris.</p><p>We recognize the reviewers concern that the lesions may not be from B. gigantea but we think this possibility is highly unlikely. Nevertheless, we have made every effort to be clear that we are interpreting the results in light of the inoculation treatment and have been careful to provide justification for our interpretations throughout the paper. </p><p>We determined that B. gigantea can infect E. virginicus in a previous study (Lane et al. 2020, reference #35) and we acknowledge that we did not test the susceptibility of D. clandestinum and E. spectabilis to B. gigantea. We aimed to be transparent with readers about our a priori knowledge of their potential susceptibility (Lines 93&#x02013;98). </p><p>It is possible, although we think unlikely, that Microstegium transmitted a seedborne endophyte to the native plants, which caused their lesions. However, native plants only formed lesions following B. gigantea inoculation, not mock inoculation. This result would suggest that the B. gigantea inoculation increased the chances of lesions forming due to the seedborne endophyte. Because the B. gigantea inoculation treatment only differed from the mock inoculation treatment in that B. gigantea spores were present, this suggests that B. gigantea alone mediated the plant&#x02013;endophyte interaction. While that may have occurred, it is far more parsimonious that B. gigantea itself caused the lesions. </p><p>If in fact B. gigantea mediated a plant&#x02013;endophyte interaction, we would expect to see a similar interaction play out in the field (Microstegium seeds were collected from the field), making our results still relevant for the ecological interactions of the species. While we do not address this specific case in the Discussion, we acknowledge the potential roles of seedborne pathogens, contamination, and co-occurrence of multiple pathogens (Lines 442&#x02013;457).</p><p>We did not have sufficient data to test the effects of Microstegium density on native plant disease incidence and we describe the effects of Microstegium density on native plant lesions as trends (Lines 282&#x02013;285). We do not want to mislead readers in our certainty that Microstegium is necessary for lesions to form on the native species. There were multiple cases in which Microstegium was present and lesions did not form. Therefore, we revised the Results text as follows:</p><p>&#x0201c;Bipolaris gigantea inoculation resulted in lesions on all three native plant species but only in some of the Microstegium density treatments (Fig 3).&#x0201d; rather than &#x0201c;&#x02026;only in the presence of Microstegium&#x0201d; (Lines 279&#x02013;280). </p><p>Accordingly, we also revised the Discussion text:</p><p>&#x0201c;Fungal lesions were observed on some native plants grown with Microstegium&#x0201d; rather than &#x0201c;Fungal lesions were observed on native plants grown with Microstegium&#x0201d; (Lines 414&#x02013;415)</p><p>To help clarify that lesions were only observed with B. gigantea inoculation and not with mock inoculation (besides the single pot we believe was erroneously inoculated; Lines 183&#x02013;185), we edited the x-axis of Fig. S1 and included data from the mock inoculation treatment in Figs. 2 and 3.</p><p>Reviewer #2: (No Response)</p><p>Reviewer #3: (No Response)</p><p>7.
