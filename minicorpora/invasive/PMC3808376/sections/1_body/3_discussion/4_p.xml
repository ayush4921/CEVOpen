<p>In conclusion, our results suggest that the maximum quantum yield of PSII (Fv / Fm) seems to be a good predictor for plant fitness, mainly under homogeneous conditions, because even minor changes in plant physiological status can have direct and significant consequences for plant reproduction. Considering that drought stress is considered as one of the main constraints to plant survival, growth and reproduction [
