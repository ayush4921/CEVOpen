<p>On the other hand, adjusted R-square and precipitation seasonality were negatively correlated reflecting an interesting trade-off between environmental stability and reproductive maternal fitness. This could be a pattern in invasive plant species. For example, several studies suggested that under heterogeneous or stressful conditions some invasive plants can maintain a relative positive fitness (as shown here for 
 <italic>T. officinale</italic>), but under homogeneous or resource-rich conditions they can take a larger advantage through greater fitness [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>-
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In this sense, Richards et al. (2006) [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] suggest that invasive plants can modify its ecophysiological traits in order to maintain a constant fitness in stressful or heterogeneous climatic conditions, and maximize its fitness under favorable or homogeneous conditions. This characteristic present in several invasive plant species is called the “Jack-and-Master” strategy and help to invade environments with different climatic conditions. Considering that 
 <italic>T. officinale</italic> allocated high amount of resources to seeds in both heterogeneous and homogeneous water conditions, the “Jack-and-Master” strategy could be considered as one of the main strategies used by this species to invade broad areas worldwide. An interesting finding was that the relationship between physiological efficiency and seed-output was not depend on the environmental context, but was affected by origin of each individual. In both homogeneous and heterogeneous regimes, plant fitness was more strongly related to fluorescence parameters based on the geographic origin of individuals, suggesting the presence of an adaptive value in this relationship. This implies that the usefulness of chlorophyll fluorescence parameters as estimators of physiological performance is maintained under different environmental conditions. Nevertheless, the strength of this relationship in each environmental scenario depends of the precipitation seasonality where each individual is originated, suggesting an incipient evolution in the physiological performance-fitness relationship. Instead, under heterogeneous watering conditions, 
 <italic>T. officinale</italic> individuals originated from localities with seasonal rainfall showed a stronger relationship between physiological performance and fitness. Contrarily, under homogeneous water conditions, a stronger relationship between physiological performance and fitness were found in those individuals from locations of low rainfall seasonality. Thus, we can suggest that 
 <italic>T. officinale</italic> individuals have been subjected to different environmental regimes that have determined local adaptation at least in terms of maternal fitness. On the other hand, those 
 <italic>T. officinale</italic> individuals exposed to water conditions different from those observed in its original location showed a reduced capacity to assimilate carbon. This mismatch may decouple the linear relationship between PSII efficiency and carbon fixation due to changes in the rate of photorespiration or pseudocyclic electron transport [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Thus, in those individuals subjected to environmental conditions different to those where they were originated, more electrons must be transported trough PSII for each molecule of CO
 <sub>2</sub> assimilated in relation to those individuals habiting environments close to those where were originated. This adaptive response based on high values of physiological performance and seed-output, and can be translated in whole performance gains if we consider all the study genotypes of 
 <italic>T. officinale</italic> as a whole species more than individuals from different geographic localities.
