0: Plant fitness defined as the relative reproductive success of a genotype as measured by survival, fecundity or other life history parameters [ 21]- is highly dependent on a series factors such as environmental stress, life cycle, and breeding system.
1: As pointed out by Valladares (1999) [ 22] the Darwinian fitness concept is easy to understand, however, it can be extremely difficult to measure directly and it can be only measured in relative terms.
2: Hence, plant fitness is estimated through indirect parameters such as plant size, adult longevity, or growth, which are correlated to fitness, but also to plasticity.
3: We performed a controlled experiment with individuals from the invasive species  Taraxacum officinale Weber ex F. H. Wigg (Dandelion) from five continents as plant model because is an apomictic plant.
4: It reproduces through unfertilized ovules that are genetically identical to the mother plant [ 23].
5: In this way, we were able to evaluate the extent of the relationship between physiological performance and fitness and to properly isolate if a physiology-fitness relationship between different genotypes has an adaptive basis.
6: Specifically, we tested the prediction that photochemical efficiency can be a good predictor of plant fitness by using second generation (F 2) individuals of  T. officinale as to ask whether: (i) Are higher photochemical efficiency values correlated with higher female fitness, measured as seed-output?, (ii) Does environmental heterogeneity modify the strength of the relationship between physiological performance and female fitness?, and (iii) Has the variation in the physiology-fitness relationship any adaptive relevance under different abiotic scenarios?
