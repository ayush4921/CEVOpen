0: Chlorophyll fluorescence parameters (e.g., maximum quantum yield) have been used to obtain qualitative and quantitative information about the photosynthesis process [ 11- 14].
1: Fluorescence estimates the maximum operating quantum efficiency of electron transport through photosystem II (PSII) in leaves and reflects the internal status of the photosynthetic machinery [ 13, 15, 16].
2: Hence, changes in chlorophyll fluorescence could be interpreted as changes in photosynthetic activity.
3: Because changes in these traits are very susceptible to environmental conditions, it has been widely employed to detect the effects of environmental changes and stress factors on physiological performance [ 2, 17, 18].
4: Furthermore, and based on the correlation between quantum efficiency (estimated by chlorophyll fluorescence) and rate of carbon exchange, some authors have argued that chlorophyll fluorescence parameters are suitable proxies of growth and even fitness (see,  18, 19).
5: Despite the extensive knowledge about the use of chlorophyll fluorescence as indicator of plant stress [ 1, 4, 19, 20], there is no consensus regarding its usefulness as an estimator of whole plant fitness.
6: For example, Arntz et al.
7: (2000) [ 1] showed that a lower photosynthetic rate decreased the fecundity and survival in different family lines of  Amaranthus hybridus.
8: On the other hand, Figueroa et al.
9: (1997) [ 19] used 11 Mediterranean plant species to show that low values of the maximum quantum yield are correlated with high mortality when plants experienced high stress induced by drought.
10: Nonetheless, and to the extent of our knowledge, there are no studies to date that explicitly evaluate the cause-effect relationship between chlorophyll fluorescence and plant fitness.
