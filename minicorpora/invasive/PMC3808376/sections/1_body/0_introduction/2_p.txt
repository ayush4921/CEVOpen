0: A higher photosynthesis rate leads to increased resource uptake that can be allocated to different plant functions, thus improving growth, fecundity, and survival [ 1, 6].
1: Relative growth rate can be modeled as a product of net assimilation rate, of which photosynthesis is one of the major components.
2: Because variation in this component will contribute to relative growth rate and its effects can vary in magnitude [ 7], a higher photosynthetic rate will confer a higher growth rate.
3: Although, these models do not extend to estimates of fitness such as survival or fecundity, increased assimilation rates should confer an increased fitness.
4: In natural populations, plant growth and other morphological traits have positive correlations with components of fitness [ 8- 10].
5: Nonetheless, direct relationships between physiological traits and fitness are seldom found in the literature (but see,  1).
