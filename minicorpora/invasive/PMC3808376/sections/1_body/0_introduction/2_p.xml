<p>A higher photosynthesis rate leads to increased resource uptake that can be allocated to different plant functions, thus improving growth, fecundity, and survival [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Relative growth rate can be modeled as a product of net assimilation rate, of which photosynthesis is one of the major components. Because variation in this component will contribute to relative growth rate and its effects can vary in magnitude [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], a higher photosynthetic rate will confer a higher growth rate. Although, these models do not extend to estimates of fitness such as survival or fecundity, increased assimilation rates should confer an increased fitness. In natural populations, plant growth and other morphological traits have positive correlations with components of fitness [

 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Nonetheless, direct relationships between physiological traits and fitness are seldom found in the literature (but see,
