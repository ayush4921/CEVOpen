0: Plant biologists have long been fascinated by the question if photosynthetic rate should increase carbon gain leading to an increase in fitness through higher survivorship or fecundity (sensu [ 1]).
1: For example, several ecophysiological studies have evaluated plant performance by measuring functional traits related to photosynthesis under different stressors [ 2- 4].
2: Since photosynthesis is very sensitive to abiotic and biotic stress [ 5], any individuals exposed to a stressful scenario may show diminished photosynthetic rates.
