0: At the end of the experiment we recorded the number of plants reaching anthesis and the number of capitula produced by each plant.
1: Each capitulum was bagged with a transparent nylon mesh to prevent pollinator visitation and seed loss, and then seed production per capitulum was determined.
2: Seed output was calculated as the ratio between the number of filled seeds and the total number of seeds (i.e., including aborted and predated seeds) produced per capitula (see,  26).
3: This way, we obtained physiological performance and a fitness estimate for each individual.
