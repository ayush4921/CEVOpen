0: We measured physiological performance (maximum quantum yield) at the end of the anthesis at room temperature using a pulse-amplitude modulated fluorometer (FMS 2, Hansatech, Instruments Ltd, Norfolfk, UK).
1: We considered maximum quantum yield of PSII (F v/F m; where F v = [F m - F 0], F m = maximum fluorescence yield, and F 0 = minimum fluorescence yield) as a proxy of physiological performance (see,  18).
2: One fully-developed attached leaf from each individual was dark adapted for 30 min (to obtain open PSII centers) using leaf-clips to ensure maximum photochemical efficiency.
3: The fiber-optic and its adaptor were fixed to a ring located over the clip at approximately 10 mm from the sample and the different light pulses were applied (see below).
4: Signal recordings and calculations were performed using the data analysis and control software provided with the instrument.
5: Minimal fluorescence (F 0) with all PSII reactions in the open state was determined by applying a weak modulated light (0.4 mol m -2 s -1).
6: Maximal fluorescence (F m) with all PSII reaction centers in the closed state was induced by a 0.8s saturating pulse of white light (9000 mol m -2 s -1).
7: After 15 s, the actinic light (180 mol m -2 s -1) was turned on and the same saturating pulse described previously was applied every 60s, until steady-state photosynthesis was reached in order to obtain the steady-state fluorescence yield (F s) and light-adapted fluorescence maximum (F m').
8: Finally, F 0' was measured after turning the actinic light off and applying a 2 s far red light pulse (see, 18]).
