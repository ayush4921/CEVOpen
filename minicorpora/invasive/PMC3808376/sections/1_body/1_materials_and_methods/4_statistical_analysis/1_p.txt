0: To test the hypothesis that seed-output is directly affected by physiological performance, we used standard Pearson correlation in order to investigate the relationship between quantum yield and seed output in  T. officinale individuals from different localities.
1: Each pair of measurements used to estimate Pearson correlations (physiological performance and seed-output) were recorded in the same individual.
2: On the other hand, we assessed the R-square obtained from Pearson correlations for each locality with the precipitation seasonality (considered as the coefficient of variation of precipitations (CV = Standard deviation / Mean)) in order to evaluate if the strength of the physiology-fitness relationship is modified with environmental scenario.
3: Finally, in order to evaluate if the relationship between physiological performance and seed-output of different localities had an adaptive value, we plotted the variation in fitness (seed output) of all  T. officinale localities with the physiological performance (Fv / Fm) and precipitation seasonality in both homogeneous and heterogeneous watering condition.
4: Climatic data from each sampled locality was downloaded from the WorldClim data-base ( http://www.worldclim.org/) on the accumulated annual precipitation (rainfall, in mm), and rainfall seasonality (RS: standard deviation of the mean monthly rainfall, in mm).
