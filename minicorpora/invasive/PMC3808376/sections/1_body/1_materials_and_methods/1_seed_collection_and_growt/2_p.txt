0: Seeds of  T. officinale were collected in 17 localities from five continents ( Table 1).
1: Within each locality a small number of seeds (four to five) per forty to forty-five individual plants were collected.
2: This material provided the initial pool of seeds.
3: Seeds from all localities were germinated in a room at 24  2 C on wet filter paper in Petri dishes and planted in 500-mL plastic pots filled with potting soil.
4: First generation plants (F 1) were generated from this initial seed pool and were grown in a greenhouse at Universidad de Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile (3648  S, 7303  W) under natural conditions of light and temperature (1300 mol m -2s -1  50 and 22  2 C, respectively).
5: All plants were watered daily with 75 ml of tap water.
6: After five months these plants produced the achenes that were used to obtain experimental plants (F 2).
