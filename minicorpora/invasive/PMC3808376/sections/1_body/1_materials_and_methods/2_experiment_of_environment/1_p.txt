0: Second generation seedlings from all localities were planted in 500-mL plastic pots filled with potting soil, and transferred to greenhouse.
1: Two watering regimes were applied to individuals from all populations.
2: In the homogeneous environmental regime, plants received 50 ml of water every day (350 ml per week).
3: Plants in the heterogeneous environmental regime also received a total of 350 ml of water, but watering was randomly distributed during the week, with a minimum and maximum amount of 25 and 100 ml of water irrigation, respectively.
4: The full experiment resulted in 12 replicates x 2 watering scenarios x 17 localities = 408 pots in total.
5: Pot position within the greenhouse was changed every five days and interpot distances were sufficient to prevent mutual shading.
6: Plants were supplemented with 0.2 g l -1 of Phostrogen (Solaris, N-P-K, 14:10:27) once every 15 d. Experimental treatments lasted for 150 days and then we measured maximum quantum yield and seed-output as proxies of physiological performance and fitness traits, respectively.
