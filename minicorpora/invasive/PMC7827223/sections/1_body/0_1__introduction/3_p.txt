0: Images that are acquired by UAVs can be analysed while using computer vision and GIS techniques.
1: Important results can then be obtained by reducing the complexity contained in the images (using different image interpretation strategies) and the findings can be presented in elaborate visualisations [ 21].
2: Persistent homology, a tool of topological data analysis, can help to understand complex datasets by analysing their large scale geometric features [ 22].
3: In our study, we have used persistent homology to measure the spread of invasive species.
4: Processing images and creating orthomosaics allow for a fast analysis of large amounts of data.
5: Deep learning techniques additionally automatize classification and localisation processes, and make it possible to incorporate expert knowledge into the automatic image processing pipeline.
6: This has the potential to increase the scale of the resulting studies to reach large regions that are significant in terms of country-level invasive species detection and management.
