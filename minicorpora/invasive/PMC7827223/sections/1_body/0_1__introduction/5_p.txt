0: The following objectives guided this study: (I)To use UAV data in order to provide allometric statistics (height, area, and number) of invasive blueberry in large areas at bush level.
1: (II)To use clustering techniques and persistent homology to quantitatively and qualitatively assess the spread of blueberry invasions.
2: (III)To assess the potential of Deep learning to automatically segment blueberry bushes, initiating the possibility for even larger-scale studies.
