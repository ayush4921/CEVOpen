0: In this study, the incorporation of all the mentioned techniques from remote sensing, GIS, computer vision, computational topology, and artificial intelligence allows for us to study invasive species on a large scale, with minimum disturbances and the incorporation of expert knowledge.
1: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that includes different techniques and UAV gathered data to increase the understanding of an invasive blueberry species in wetlands.
2: Furthermore, locating and studying small bushes in large areas and at the single-bush level was done for the first time.
3: Therefore, UAV-supported methods offer an efficient possibility to discover individual young plants on a large scale and detect propagation hotspots at an early stage.
