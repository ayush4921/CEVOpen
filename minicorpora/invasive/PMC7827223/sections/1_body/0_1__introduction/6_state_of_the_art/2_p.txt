0: In comparison to satellite images UAV images provide a higher resolution and appear to be more suitable for wetland investigations, especially when focusing on invasive species.
1: Higher resolution images allow for higher accuracies of image interpretations and feature extractions [ 30].
2: Several studies using UAVs in wetlands have already been carried out [ 31, 32, 33, 34].
3: Reference [ 34] developed a method for detecting and mapping invasive species with UAVs.
4: The authors acknowledged UAVs as suitable for monitoring eradication efforts in wetlands.
5: Reference [ 33] realized the higher efficiency in gathering valuable and accurate information in comparison to field studies, when using UAVs and computer vision techniques to enhance classifications and health assessments in wetlands.
6: Gandhi et al.
7: [ 31] used UAV imagery for detecting invasive species and mapping their distribution and spread.
8: This study also compared data from two years (2009 and 2011) and detected an increase of 19.07%, which was confirmed by field studies with a total agreement of 94% and shows the suitability of UAV imaging for this kind of application.
9: Reference [ 31] lanalysed the spread of  Spartina alterniflora in Beihai in the years 2009 and 2011, using high resolution images acquired by UAVs.
10: They captured images at a flight height of 800 m, generated orthomosiacs, performed multi-resolution segmentation by grouping homogenous pixels, and classified them.
11: The target species was extracted by their pixel values.
12: In a final step the accuracy was assessed and verified with field data by comparing three sample plots (a total of 166 samples) with the image results.
13: A total accuracy of 94.0% could be achieved and, hence, provided information regarding an increasing spread of 19.07% from 2009 to 2011.
14: The total infected area was, in 2011, 357.2 ha.
15: Moreover, the image analysis provided the opportunity to identify areas with different levels of densities.
16: Reference [ 35] collected UAV images of  Harrisia pomanensis in the Limpopo province of South Africa.
17: An area of 87 ha was captured by images that were taken at a height of 800 to 817 m. Orthomosaics generated with Agisoft Photoscan and pixel as well as object-based classifiers were used.
18: The classification results of supervised and unsupervised classifiers were assessed.
19: The supervised classification outperformed the unclassified one, and the object-based approach outperformed the pixel-based one.
20: The best accuracy achieved was 86.1%.
