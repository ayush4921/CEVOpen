<p>In comparison to satellite images UAV images provide a higher resolution and appear to be more suitable for wetland investigations, especially when focusing on invasive species. Higher resolution images allow for higher accuracies of image interpretations and feature extractions [

 <xref rid="B33-sensors-21-00471" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] realized the higher efficiency in gathering valuable and accurate information in comparison to field studies, when using UAVs and computer vision techniques to enhance classifications and health assessments in wetlands. Gandhi et al. [
 <xref rid="B31-sensors-21-00471" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] used UAV imagery for detecting invasive species and mapping their distribution and spread. This study also compared data from two years (2009 and 2011) and detected an increase of 19.07%, which was confirmed by field studies with a total agreement of 94% and shows the suitability of UAV imaging for this kind of application.

 <xref rid="B31-sensors-21-00471" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] lanalysed the spread of 
 <italic>Spartina alterniflora</italic> in Beihai in the years 2009 and 2011, using high resolution images acquired by UAVs. They captured images at a flight height of 800 m, generated orthomosiacs, performed multi-resolution segmentation by grouping homogenous pixels, and classified them. The target species was extracted by their pixel values. In a final step the accuracy was assessed and verified with field data by comparing three sample plots (a total of 166 samples) with the image results. A total accuracy of 94.0% could be achieved and, hence, provided information regarding an increasing spread of 19.07% from 2009 to 2011. The total infected area was, in 2011, 357.2 ha. Moreover, the image analysis provided the opportunity to identify areas with different levels of densities. Reference [
 <xref rid="B35-sensors-21-00471" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] collected UAV images of 
 <italic>Harrisia pomanensis</italic> in the Limpopo province of South Africa. An area of 87 ha was captured by images that were taken at a height of 800 to 817 m. Orthomosaics generated with Agisoft Photoscan and pixel as well as object-based classifiers were used. The classification results of supervised and unsupervised classifiers were assessed. The supervised classification outperformed the unclassified one, and the object-based approach outperformed the pixel-based one. The best accuracy achieved was 86.1%.
