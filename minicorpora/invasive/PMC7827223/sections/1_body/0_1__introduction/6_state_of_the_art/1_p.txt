0: In recent years, remote sensing techniques have been used in various natural environments with the goal of reducing the need for in situ measurements [ 23].
1: Low-cost data gathering, time saving, and larger study areas are the benefits.
2: Furthermore, data can be directly used and processed within Geographical Information Systems (GIS) [ 23].
3: This has been done successfully, for environmental studies [ 24, 25, 26].
4: Closely related to the current work, Reference [ 27] proposed using GIS as a synthesising tool in invasive species management approaches.
5: Reference [ 28] used satellite images of 1992 and 2002 in order to identify stress indicators and change detection in a wetland in Sri Lanka to quantify the conditions of the complex.
6: The authors state that the inventory, mapping, and monitoring are needed to understand interactions in the ecosystem.
7: Classification with the Maximum Likelihood Algorithm were performed, mapping and spatial analysis were used, and finally refined and verified with ground data.
8: Their approach ([ 28]) reached 86% accuracy and provided detailed analysis.
9: GIS in combination with remote sensing data was found to be an effective methodology for investigating wetlands.
10: Reference [ 29] evaluated vegetation change detection while using the NDVI of remote sensing data and applied GIS in order to visualise the results.
11: Landsat and Shuttle Radar Topography Missions were used to capture the Vellore District.
12: Image interpretations were carried out using ERGDAS IMAGINE software in order to classify and detect changes in the vegetation.
13: The differences in the NDVI values were used to analyse data sets of the years 2001 to 2006.
14: The study provided information about the lowest decrease in the forest area by 6%, while agriculture land increased the most by 19%.
