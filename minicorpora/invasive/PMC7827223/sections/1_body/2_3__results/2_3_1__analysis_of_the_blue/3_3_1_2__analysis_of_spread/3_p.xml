<p>Based on the point shapefiles of the blueberry bushes, density maps were generated to see how the bushes were distributed within the map. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-21-00471-f006">Figure 6</xref> provides three examples of the orthomosaics B1 to B3. Areas with a high density are marked in red and low densities in dark green. Orthomosaic B1 has one large density spot in the northwestern part of the map, while the southeast direction the density decreases with only single or paired bushes. Orthomosaic B2 shows four density spots. Two smaller ones were located in the northwest, a larger spot is in the middle of the orthomosaic and a final one in the southeast. The space between the middle and southeast spot is covered by blueberry bushes, which was similar to the distribution of B3. In orthomosaic B4, nearly the whole area is covered with green to reddish colours. There are three dense spots in the northwest, two spots in the middle and one in the southeast. In comparison to B2 and B3, the spots are smaller. Orthomosaic B6 covers a larger area than all other orthomosaics, but only three density spots could be identified in the middle of the orthomosaic. There were smaller groups of blueberry bushes along the borders of the orthomosaic, and single ones are distributed close to the groups of bushes.
