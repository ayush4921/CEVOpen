<p>Another analysis focused on the point analysis to generate a map of hotspot areas in order to analyse the spread of the blueberry species. The point analysis used the manually marked blueberry bushes to identify where the proximity of the bushes was significantly different (hot and cold), and to quantify those that were not identified as significantly different. In B1, two 90% confidence hotspots were found in the north. 21 clusters were identified to be 90% significantly different from the study area. The hotspots in B2 were concentrated in the south-easternmost part of the orthomosaic. 26 clusters (out of 220) were significantly different to the study area with a confidence interval of 99%. These points contained all of the bushes located in the south-easternmost part of the orthomosaic. In B3 16 out of the 214 clusters fell into the 99% confidence interval, all located in the south-east of the orthomosaic. The same characteristic was found in B4. 23 clusters out of 248 were found to be significant with a 99% confidence and seven points with 90% to 95% confidence. B4 was the only orthomosaic containing two points considered to be cold spots with 90% confidence in the centre of the orthomosaic.</p>
