<p>In a second step of our quantitative analysis of the blueberry invasion, the concentration, density, and spread patterns were examined. GIS and persistent homology were used to assess these issues. Characterisations of concentrations and densities can indicate the number of blueberry bushes within a given region of the orthomosaic, which exceeds a simple location because the distribution of the bushes can be analysed precisely. Clustering bushes and mapping densities further increase the understanding of the distribution. Together with the persistent homology and hotspot analysis, the spread can be defined for all orthomosaics, which helps to characterise the invasion.</p>
