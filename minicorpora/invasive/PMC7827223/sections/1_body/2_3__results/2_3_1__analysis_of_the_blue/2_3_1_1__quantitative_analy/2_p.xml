<p>One important aspect was to calculate the area of blueberry bushes within the orthomosaics. The area covered by the orthomosaics varied between 10.6 to 12.5 ha, only B6 was larger with 15.5 ha (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-21-00471-f001">Figure 1</xref>) the main part of the image represented soils. This was validated by the area calculations: with 76% of the orthomosaic B2 and 89% of B3, soil represents the highest values of all classes. The second smaller pie shows the living vegetation varying between 4.7% in B1 to 18.6% in B2. Out of the living vegetation, 8.2% (B2), 15.0% (B3), and 21.1% (B1) are blueberry bushes. In most of the orthomosaics blueberries were the least frequent class (with 1 to 1.5%).
