<p>Regarding the refinement step of the algorithm, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-21-00471-f008">Figure 8</xref> presents an example of the obtained results. For most of the predicted patches, the segmentation that was obtained with the refined version of the algorithm is much closer to the manual annotation. However, in a few cases, some of the bushes that had originally been detected are missed after the refinement. 
 <xref rid="sensors-21-00471-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> presents the detailed results of these two issues.
