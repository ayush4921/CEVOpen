<p>Deep learning techniques were used in order to assess whether DNN can be used to automatically detect the presence of blueberry bushes. Since the manual annotation of the blueberry bushes is the most time-consuming step of this workflow, this has the potential to greatly extend the range of studies. The results in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot2-sensors-21-00471">Section 3.2</xref> show that the ResNet50 network succeeded at the classification tasks associated to our problem and that the best results were obtained by re-training the whole network. In this respect, relying on pre-trained weights from ImageNet to solve our problem after minor re-training of the last layer is suboptimal. A dataset must be large enough to re-train the full networks. In our case, this meant using images that were taken from three orthomosaics covering a total of 33 hectares.
