<p>The area that was occupied by blueberry bushes was low in terms of the studied area (covering 1 to 1.5 %), which is lower than the identified 3 to 5% in [
 <xref rid="B15-sensors-21-00471" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, when only the living vegetation was considered, the number of blueberry bushes was found to increase from 8.2 up to 21.1%. These percentages can be considered to be very high, due to the fact that the species is invasive and it does not belong to this sensitive ecosystem. B6 has the largest area and it contains the smallest number of blueberry bushes, with the smallest height and area values measured. Therefore, the invasion seems to be in an early stage and it should be easier to manage. Nevertheless, as shown by persistent homology and the high number of single bushes after clustering, bushes were wide spread, which increases the area where measures against the blueberry bushes need to be considered. The hotspot analysis and density map of B6 indicated that there are some bushes, which are concentrated in a dense spot in the middle of the area and distributed from there homogeneously. These findings allowed for determining that the progress of the blueberry bushes into this site is low.
