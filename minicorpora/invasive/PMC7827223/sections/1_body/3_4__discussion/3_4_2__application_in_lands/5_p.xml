<p>Furthermore, the distribution of the blueberry bushes can be connected to the proximity of trees, especially in B1 to B3, where bushes are mainly found around pine trees and shrubby birches, since birds use these as rest areas and mainly distribute seeds where they rest. An exception is B4, where the trees are located next to depressions that are filled with water, which confirms the unsuitable living conditions for blueberry species. In general, it seems that more blueberry bushes occur when the density of the living vegetation is higher, which can be explained by better living conditions and a better distribution through birds.</p>
