0: Two main approaches were used in order to obtain a higher detection rate for the blueberry class: Data augmentation is a commonly used strategy in deep learning and it can increase the size of the training datasets without the need to collect new data.
1: In this case, data augmentation was used to generate new synthetic patches of the blueberry class, which was the less frequent class (see     Section 3.2 for details).
2: Six image transformations to augment the data were used: up/down and left/right flips; small central rotations with a random angle, in order to simulate different perspectives of the bushes; Gaussian blurring of the images, which simulates blurring due to the movement of the UAV; linear and small contrast changes, which can represent different light and shadow conditions and localised elastic deformations.
3: In order to implement this transformations we used the imgaug library [    44].
4: Loss functions are used to compute the accuracy of the network and update their parameters.
5: By giving different weights to different classes, their importance can be changed during training.
6: In this study, two loss functions were used; the first function checks if a patch contains a blueberry or not, while the second one checks the fraction of blueberry pixels inside the patch.
7: The optimal training settings followed the ones that were used in our previous study [    43].
