0: Blueberries have been cultivated in commercial plantations in Lower Saxony since the early 1930s [ 14].
1: Since then, the area under cultivation has steadily increased.
2: In 2005, the area with blueberry cultivation in Lower Saxony was approximately 1400 hectares [ 13].
3: In nature, blueberries are mainly distributed by birds and small mammals, who spread the seeds.
4: Once established, plants can spread in a vicinity by clonal growth and the high regeneration potential of blueberries favours a strong spread [ 10].
5: The species prefers acidic locations, such as pine forests or wetlands.
6: Especially, raised bogs in their degeneration stage provide ideal habitat conditions for invasive blueberries [ 14].
7: Thus, blueberries are growing increasingly wild in neighbouring areas.
8: References [ 9, 14] found a correlation between the density of blueberries and the distance to blueberry plantations; a maximum distance of 1700 m was recorded.
9: Near cultivated areas, the feral blueberries form dense shrub stands with height of up to 23 m and have a ground coverage of up to >60%.
10: With increasing distance, the degree of coverage decreases rapidly [ 8, 9, 13].
11: Since these studies were already conducted in the last millennium, a larger distribution must be expected today.
12: Reference [ 10] describes a distribution of blueberry bushes over 4 ha in the Krahenmoor, where the maximum distance to the plantation was identified at 100 m. Blueberry bushes are low and can reach a height of 60 cm, but, occasionally, tall species can be found with a height of 3 m [ 10].
13: In the course of the increasing growth and dense shrub structures, other ground vegetation is displaced, since it cannot exist under the shade of blueberries.
14: Other presumed effects of blueberry cultivation are reduced evaporation rates and the influence on nutrient cycles in wetlands, which, in turn, can have an impact on existing plant species.
15: Therefore, human interventions are necessary to protect the sensitive rare structures and characteristic plants of wetlands [ 10].
