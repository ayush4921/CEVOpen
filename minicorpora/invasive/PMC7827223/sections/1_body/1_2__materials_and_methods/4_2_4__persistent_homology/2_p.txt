0: The H0 diagram shows the change in the connectivity of the blueberry bushes by plotting the time/radius when blueberry regions get connected.
1: False regions that were produced by our sampling of the annotated regions were discarded and only those parts of the diagrams that were obtained after all sampling points in each region had been joined together were considered.
2: Based on this outcome, the radius was calculated until 1%, 10%, 50%, and 90% of the blueberry regions were connected and plotted.
3: The diagram will vary greatly, depending on the number and position of blueberry bushes in the input image.
