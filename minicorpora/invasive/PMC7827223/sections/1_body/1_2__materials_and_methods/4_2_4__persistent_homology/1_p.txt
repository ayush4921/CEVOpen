0: Persistent homology provides topological information of complex datasets [ 42] at different spatial resolutions.
1: This information deals with the connectivity of nearby points and it can be computed in different dimensions.
2: For the purpose of this study, we worked with 0-D persistent homology (usually expressed in the form of H0 diagrams).
3: H0 homology can be seen as growing disk at uniform radius-increase speed around pre-defined data points.
4: In order to use this tool, we first discredited the manually annotated blueberry regions by uniformly sampling them.
5: Subsequently, the radius around each sample point was increased to grow blueberry bush regions.
6: When two blueberry regions were merged because of the expansion, one of the regions was considered to be dead because it was absorbed by the other region.
7: As time passed, the number of connected blueberry regions decreased, and finally all of the regions were connected in one region.
