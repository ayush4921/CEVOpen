<p>Persistent homology provides topological information of complex datasets [
 <xref rid="B42-sensors-21-00471" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] at different spatial resolutions. This information deals with the connectivity of nearby points and it can be computed in different dimensions. For the purpose of this study, we worked with 0-D persistent homology (usually expressed in the form of H0 diagrams). H0 homology can be seen as growing disk at uniform radius-increase speed around pre-defined data points. In order to use this tool, we first discredited the manually annotated blueberry regions by uniformly sampling them. Subsequently, the radius around each sample point was increased to grow blueberry bush regions. When two blueberry regions were merged because of the expansion, one of the regions was considered to be dead because it was absorbed by the other region. As time passed, the number of connected blueberry regions decreased, and finally all of the regions were connected in one region.
