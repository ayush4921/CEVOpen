0: On the basis of the annotation made for all orthomosaics, several simple python codes and ArcGIS were used to perform image analysis.
1: Pixels were counted for all orthomosaics, as well as all annotated layers.
2: The number of black pixels in the annotated layers were specifically counted in order to obtain the percentage and area in m 2 per class.
3: Additionally, the overall area presented in the orthomosaics was calculated in hectares.
4: Because the focus of this study was on the blueberry bushes, several statistical values were generated: the number of blueberry bushes was counted and the number of blueberry bushes per ha was calculated for each orthomosaic.
5: Additionally, the total area, as well as the area per blueberry bush, were computed in m 2.
6: Furthermore, the proportion of blueberry bushes in relation to the vegetation was calculated in %.
7: Finally, height values were computed on the basis of DEMs, annotations of the blueberry bushes, and annotations of ground points per site.
8: Ground points were annotated close to blueberry bushes in order to increase the accuracy of the computed height.
9: Maximum height values were estimated in a first analysis and the median height in a second analysis to evaluate the results.
