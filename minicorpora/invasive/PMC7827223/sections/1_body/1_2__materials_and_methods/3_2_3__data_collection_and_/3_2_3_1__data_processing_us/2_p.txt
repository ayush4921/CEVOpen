0: In this context, the positions of the blueberry bushes in the five orthomosaics were digitised by hand as point data in an ArcGIS shapefile and several analytical tools were then used ( Figure 2).
1: The  kernel density tool functions were used to calculate the magnitude-per-unit area from the blueberry points.
2: Smaller search radiuses were used to show a detailed density raster.
3: The tool  integrate was used to group blueberry bushes that fall into a specified distance, as specified distance, 3 and 6 m were used.
4: With the tool  collect event, the number of points which were integrated before, were summarized in a new layer.
5: Those steps were necessary to perform an  optimized hotspot analysis of the blueberry abundance with the blueberry point shapefile.
6: The hotspot analysis identifies the significant difference between the neighbourhood of a feature in comparison to the extent of the respective study area.
7: Is the value of a feature significantly higher, it is considered to be a hotspot and the tool provides a feature map with three levels of confidence (90%, 95%, and 99%).
8: As input for the hot spot analysis, the created layer of the tool  collect events was used and analysis field counts were chosen.
9: Furthermore, it also indicates the significantly lower features.
