0: The chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were tested by a chlorophyll fluorescence imaging system (CF imager, Technical Ltd., Colchester, UK).
1: Before each test of the minimum fluorescence (F o) and maximum fluorescence (F m), the leaves were dark-adapted for 20 min.
2: The maximum quantum yield (F v/F m) of PSII photochemistry was calculated using the following formula: (F mF o)/F m. The steady-state fluorescence (F s) and the maximum fluorescence (F m) in the light-adapted state were measured at 800 mol m 2s 1 PPFD.
3: The actual photochemical efficiency ( PSII) was calculated as  PSII = (F mF s)/F m.
