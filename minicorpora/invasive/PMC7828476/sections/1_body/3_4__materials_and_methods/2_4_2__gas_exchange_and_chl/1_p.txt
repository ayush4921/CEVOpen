0: Gas exchange was measured using the Li-6400 portable photosynthesis system (LI-COR, Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA).
1: Before the measurement, the leaves were acclimated for 510 min at a photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) of 800 mol m 2s 1 and a CO 2 concentration was maintained at 400 mol mol 1 in this study.
2: Once the steady-state gas exchange rates were observed at these conditions, the instrument automatically calculates and records the net photosynthetic rate (P n).
