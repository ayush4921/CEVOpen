0: Cell membrane leakage was measured by a DDS-11C conductometer (Shanghai Dapu Instruments) as described by Zheng et al., with minor modifications [ 37].
1: Three 0.8-cm-diameter leaf discs were incubated in 5 mL of distilled water for 3 h. Then, the samples were boiled for 30 min.
2: The cell membrane leakage rate was calculated according to the formula: (R1/R2)  100%, where R1 and R2 are the initial conductivity and electrolyte conductivity, respectively.
