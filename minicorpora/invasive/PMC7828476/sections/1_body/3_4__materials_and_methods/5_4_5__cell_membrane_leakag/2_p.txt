0: Malondialdehyde (MDA) was determined using the thiobarbituric acid (TBA) method.
1: Leaf samples (0.1 g) were ground in 2 mL of 0.1% ( w/ v) trichloroacetic acid (TCA) solution, and the homogenate was centrifuged.
2: Total of 1 mL of supernatant was reacted with an equal volume of 0.67% ( w/ v) thiobarbituric acid (TBA) in a boiling water bath for 30 min.
3: The absorbance of the mixture was measured at 600, 532, and 450 nm wavelengths by a UV-Vis 2450 spectrophotometer.
4: According to the formula of Wang and Jin [ 38], the MDA content was calculated.
