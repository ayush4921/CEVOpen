0: Enzymatic antioxidants including SOD, POD, CAT, and APX were determined according to the methods of Tan et al.
1: [ 42], Du et al.
2: [ 43], Jiang et al.
3: [ 44], and Nakano and Asada [ 45], respectively, with slight modifications.
4: SOD activity was measured by examining its ability to inhibit the photoreduction of nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT).
5: Each 3 mL assay mixture contained: phosphate buffer (50 mM; pH 7.8), 20 M riboflavin, 130 mM methionine, 0.1 M EDTA, 750 mM NBT, and 100 L of enzyme extract.
6: The absorbance of the samples was recorded at a wavelength of 560 nm.
7: The reaction solution for POD activity comprised phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.0), 30 mM H 2O 2, guaiacol, and 100 L of enzyme extract.
8: The enzyme activity was estimated by recording the increase in absorbance at 470 nm every 15 s for 3 min.
9: The CAT activity was measured by catalyzing the breakdown of H 2O 2 at 240 nm during 2 min.
10: A final volume of 3 mL of assay mixture included 30 mM H 2O 2 and 100 L of enzyme extract.
11: For the estimation of APX activity, reaction ingredients were composed of 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 0.1 mM EDTA, 5 mM AsA, and 20 mM H 2O 2.
12: Subsequently, the reaction was started after which 100 L of enzyme extract was added, and the change in absorbance at 290 nm was recorded for 1 min.
