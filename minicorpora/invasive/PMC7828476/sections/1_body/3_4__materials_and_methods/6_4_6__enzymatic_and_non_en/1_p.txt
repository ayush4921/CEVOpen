0: Flavonoid, total phenol, and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were extracted from 0.1 g of leaves in 2 mL of 95% ( v/ v) methanol at 4 C for 24 h. Briefly, flavonoid content was measured as described by the modified method of Park et al.
1: [ 39].
2: The reaction mixture contained 2 mL of 8-fold diluted extract, 200 L of 5% NaNO 2, 300 L of 10% AlCl 3, and 1 mL of 1 M NaOH.
3: The absorbance of the mixture at 510 nm was determined by using a spectrophotometer.
4: According to Cheung et al.
5: [ 40], the total phenolic content of the extracts was measured following the method of FolinCiocalteu at a wavelength of 765 nm.
6: 1 mL 10% FolinCiocalteu Reagent and 2 mL of 0.7 M Na 2CO 3 were mixed with 1 mL of extract.
7: Total antioxidant capacity was assayed in a reaction solution consisting of 150 L of extracts and 3 mL of 120 mM DPPH solution [ 41].
8: The absorbance at 517 nm was determined after the mixture was incubated in the dark for 20 min.
