<p>Flavonoid, total phenol, and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were extracted from 0.1 g of leaves in 2 mL of 95% (

 <xref rid="B39-ijms-22-00748" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The reaction mixture contained 2 mL of 8-fold diluted extract, 200 μL of 5% NaNO
 <sub>2</sub>, 300 μL of 10% AlCl
 <sub>3</sub>, and 1 mL of 1 M NaOH. The absorbance of the mixture at 510 nm was determined by using a spectrophotometer. According to Cheung et al. [
 <xref rid="B40-ijms-22-00748" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], the total phenolic content of the extracts was measured following the method of Folin–Ciocalteu at a wavelength of 765 nm. 1 mL 10% Folin–Ciocalteu Reagent and 2 mL of 0.7 M Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> were mixed with 1 mL of extract. Total antioxidant capacity was assayed in a reaction solution consisting of 150 μL of extracts and 3 mL of 120 mM DPPH solution [
