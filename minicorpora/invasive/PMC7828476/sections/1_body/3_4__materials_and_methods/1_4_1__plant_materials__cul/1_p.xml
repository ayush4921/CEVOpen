 <italic>Sphagneticola trilobata</italic> and 
 <italic>Sphagneticola calendulacea</italic> were collected from the campus of South China Normal University (Guangzhou, China). The experimental plant materials were propagated from segments that had two stem nodes. After rooting and growing 2–3 young leaves, the segments were transplanted into pots. One plant of each kind per pot was cultured using hydroponics in a greenhouse under natural light conditions, with a temperature of 25 ± 1 °C, 50–70% relative humidity, and a 12 h photoperiod. After one month of growth, uniform seedlings with the same size and height were selected for study. One half of the materials were randomly selected for HT treatment (35 ± 1 °C). Materials grown at room temperature (25 ± 1 °C) were used as the control group. Control and treatment groups were set for each species of Sphagneticola. After 22 days of HT treatment, the phenotype was recorded and the relevant physiological indexes were measured.
