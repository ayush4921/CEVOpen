0: Sphagneticola trilobata and  Sphagneticola calendulacea were collected from the campus of South China Normal University (Guangzhou, China).
1: The experimental plant materials were propagated from segments that had two stem nodes.
2: After rooting and growing 23 young leaves, the segments were transplanted into pots.
3: One plant of each kind per pot was cultured using hydroponics in a greenhouse under natural light conditions, with a temperature of 25  1 C, 5070% relative humidity, and a 12 h photoperiod.
4: After one month of growth, uniform seedlings with the same size and height were selected for study.
5: One half of the materials were randomly selected for HT treatment (35  1 C).
6: Materials grown at room temperature (25  1 C) were used as the control group.
7: Control and treatment groups were set for each species of Sphagneticola.
8: After 22 days of HT treatment, the phenotype was recorded and the relevant physiological indexes were measured.
