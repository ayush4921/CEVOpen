<p>Fresh leaves (0.1 g) were weighed and homogenized in cold with 1 mL phosphate buffered saline (50 mM, pH7.0). The homogenate was subsequently centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min at 4 Â°C. The determination H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> content was measured according to the instructions of the kit (Shenzhen Ziker Biological Technology Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, Guangdong, China). The absorbance of the sample was determined at a wavelength of 450 nm with a multimode plate reader (EnSpire, PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA).
