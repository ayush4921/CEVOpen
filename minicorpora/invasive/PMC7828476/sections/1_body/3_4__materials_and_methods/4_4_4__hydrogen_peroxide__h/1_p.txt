0: 3,3-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining was used to detect the production of H 2O 2 in situ.
1: Fresh leaves were infiltrated with 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.5 mg mL 1 DAB and exposed to a vacuum for 20 min.
2: After incubation for 2 h in the dark, 95% ( v/ v) ethanol was used to eliminate the chlorophyll in the leaves.
