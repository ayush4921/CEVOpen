0: Fresh leaves (0.1 g) were weighed and homogenized in cold with 1 mL phosphate buffered saline (50 mM, pH7.0).
1: The homogenate was subsequently centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min at 4 C. The determination H 2O 2 content was measured according to the instructions of the kit (Shenzhen Ziker Biological Technology Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, Guangdong, China).
2: The absorbance of the sample was determined at a wavelength of 450 nm with a multimode plate reader (EnSpire, PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA).
