0: Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, California, MA, USA) following the manufacturers protocol.
1: Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using a PrimeScript RT reagent kit (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan)).
2: Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis was achieved by a Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time PCR System (CFX96, Bio-Rad, California, USA) using a SYBR Premix Ex TaqTM II Kit (Takara, Tokyo, Japan).
3: The cycle conditions consisted of initial denaturation at 95 C for 30 s, followed by 39 cycles at 95 C for 5 s and 60 C for 34 s, and a final melt-curve of 6595 C. The analysis of gene expression levels was conducted by the 2   Ct  method [ 46].
4: The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH) gene was used as an internal reference gene in this study.
5: The primers for each gene used for qRT-PCR assays are presented in  Table 1.
