<p>Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, California, MA, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using a PrimeScript RT reagent kit (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan)). Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis was achieved by a Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time PCR System (CFX96, Bio-Rad, California, USA) using a SYBR Premix Ex Taq™ II Kit (Takara, Tokyo, Japan). The cycle conditions consisted of initial denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, followed by 39 cycles at 95 °C for 5 s and 60 °C for 34 s, and a final melt-curve of 65–95 °C. The analysis of gene expression levels was conducted by the 2
