<p>Alien species invasion is recognized as an important part of global environmental change. Throughout the 21st century, climate change and invasive alien species have been threatening biodiversity [

 <xref rid="B6-ijms-22-00748" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In many cases, climate warming may facilitate the spread of invasive plants by increasing their growth and competitive ability [

 <italic>Sphagneticola trilobata</italic> (L.) Pruski (Asteraceae), listed by the IUCN among the top 100 of most alien invasive species in the world, is a perennial creeping herb and native to South America [
 <xref rid="B8-ijms-22-00748" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It is now widely distributed in many countries and regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific. In the 1970s, it was introduced into China as a ground cover plant and soon escaped into the wild. At present, it is widely distributed in Southeast China, coastal areas, islands, and other areas [

 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> has been expanding continuously, showing strong tolerance ability under high temperature in summer, crowding out 
 <italic>Sphagneticola calendulacea</italic> (L.) Pruski and forming a single dominant species, which seriously threatens the biodiversity of its indigenous congener [
