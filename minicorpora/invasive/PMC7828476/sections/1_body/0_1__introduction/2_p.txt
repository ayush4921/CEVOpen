0: Alien species invasion is recognized as an important part of global environmental change.
1: Throughout the 21st century, climate change and invasive alien species have been threatening biodiversity [ 5, 6].
2: In many cases, climate warming may facilitate the spread of invasive plants by increasing their growth and competitive ability [ 7].
3: Sphagneticola trilobata (L.) Pruski (Asteraceae), listed by the IUCN among the top 100 of most alien invasive species in the world, is a perennial creeping herb and native to South America [ 8].
4: It is now widely distributed in many countries and regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific.
5: In the 1970s, it was introduced into China as a ground cover plant and soon escaped into the wild.
6: At present, it is widely distributed in Southeast China, coastal areas, islands, and other areas [ 9].
7: In South China,  S. trilobata has been expanding continuously, showing strong tolerance ability under high temperature in summer, crowding out  Sphagneticola calendulacea (L.) Pruski and forming a single dominant species, which seriously threatens the biodiversity of its indigenous congener [ 10].
8: This is closely related to its strong resistance mechanism.
