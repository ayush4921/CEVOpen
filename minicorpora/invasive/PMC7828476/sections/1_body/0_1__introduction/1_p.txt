0: Climate change poses potential major threats to global biodiversity and ecosystem functions.
1: The global average temperature is expected to increase by 1.44.3 C by the end of the twenty-first century [ 1].
2: Global warming and rising temperatures will cause more frequent and extremely high temperatures in many parts of the world.
3: High temperature (HT) is a worrying ecological factor.
4: When a plant is exposed abruptly to temperatures above the normal optimum, homeostasis in the cell is disturbed, some catalytic enzymes, gradually lose their activity, and the cell structure is damaged, resulting in plant growth reduction, changes in photosynthetic efficiency, oxidative stress, and even death under extreme conditions [ 2, 3, 4].
5: Therefore, high-temperature stress is among the main abiotic stresses limiting plant productivity.
