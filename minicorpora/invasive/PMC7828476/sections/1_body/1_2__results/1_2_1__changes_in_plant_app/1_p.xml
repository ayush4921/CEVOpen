<p>After 22 days of treatment, we observed that the leaves of 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> exposed to HT were greener than those of the control group (25 ± 1 °C). In contrast, 
 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic> leaves exhibited an obvious yellow color under HT treatment, especially in the leaf base region (

 <italic>a</italic>), chlorophyll 
 <italic>b</italic> (Chl

 <italic>a/b</italic> (Chl 
 <italic>a/b</italic>) in the leaves of 
 <italic>S. trilobata</italic> exposed to HT were all increased, while they decreased significantly in the leaves of 
 <italic>S. calendulacea</italic> (
