  <p>Photosynthetic response of two Sphagneticola species under HT stress. HT inhibited the expression of key PSII genes including 
   <italic>PsbP</italic>, 
   <italic>PsbA,</italic> and 
   <italic>RubiscoL</italic>, decreased F
   <sub>v</sub>/F
   <sub>m</sub> and Î¦
   <sub>PSII</sub>, and greatly reduced the photosynthetic capacity of 
   <italic>S. calendulacea</italic>. High temperature results in light inhibition, which leads to the accumulation of ROS. However, the scavenging ability of the enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant systems of 
   <italic>S. calendulacea</italic> was decreased and ROS could not be removed in time. On the one hand, the decreased antioxidant enzyme activity was due to the down-regulation of 
   <italic>SOD</italic>, 
   <italic>POD</italic>, 
   <italic>CAT,</italic> and 
   <italic>APX</italic> genes expression. On the other hand, the antioxidants contents including flavonoids, total phenols, and carotenoids were also decreased. This accumulation of ROS further caused an increase in MDA and relative conductivity, thus increasing the degree of membrane peroxidation and pigment bleaching in photosynthetic organs. However, the resistance of 
   <italic>S. trilobata</italic> to cope with HT stress was better than that of 
   <italic>S. calendulacea</italic>.
