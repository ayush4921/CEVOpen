 </sup>. These are colorimetric assays based on the reaction between a specific class of phytochemical and the specific reagents. A calibration curve is prepared for each assay by using increasing concentrations of a standard compound representative of the class: catechin (CAT) for flavonoids and catechins and ferulic acid (FA) for hydroxycinnamic acids. The color intensity of reacted samples was measured by a spectrophotometer and the concentration of the searched phytochemical family was calculated by means of the calibration curve. The amount of tannins was analyzed according to Porter and co-workers protocol

 </sup> with minor modifications; briefly, two aliquots of each sample were mixed with the reagent (50% n-butanol, 50% 12 N HCl, 0.015% FeCl
 <sub>3</sub>) and incubated for 30 min, one at room temperature and the second at 100 °C. Absorbance (Abs) was measured at 550 nm and tannin content (g/L) was calculated as (Abs
 <sub>100 °C</sub>−Abs
 <sub>room temperature</sub>) × 0.1736.
