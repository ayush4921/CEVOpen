0: The obtained fruit extracts were characterized spectrophotometrically for the specific assessment of total flavonoids 33,  34, catechins 35, and hydroxycinnamic acids 36.
1: These are colorimetric assays based on the reaction between a specific class of phytochemical and the specific reagents.
2: A calibration curve is prepared for each assay by using increasing concentrations of a standard compound representative of the class: catechin (CAT) for flavonoids and catechins and ferulic acid (FA) for hydroxycinnamic acids.
3: The color intensity of reacted samples was measured by a spectrophotometer and the concentration of the searched phytochemical family was calculated by means of the calibration curve.
4: The amount of tannins was analyzed according to Porter and co-workers protocol 37 with minor modifications; briefly, two aliquots of each sample were mixed with the reagent (50% n-butanol, 50% 12 N HCl, 0.015% FeCl 3) and incubated for 30 min, one at room temperature and the second at 100 C. Absorbance (Abs) was measured at 550 nm and tannin content (g/L) was calculated as (Abs 100 CAbs room temperature)  0.1736.
