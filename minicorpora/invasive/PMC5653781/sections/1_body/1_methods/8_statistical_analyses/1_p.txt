0: Extraction yields data were log transformed and then analyzed by one way ANOVA with the Welch correction due to their non-homogenous variances.
1: The Duncan test was performed to identify the samples significantly different from the others.
2: Antioxidant activity and total phenol content of the samples were compared to those obtained from  V.  myrtillus extracts using the Neyman method of confidence interval at 95% level.
3: Then to verify whether the antioxidant activity was due to the presence of polyphenols, to the degree of ripening, to the solvent of extraction, and to understand whether it could be of interest to better characterize polyphenols, we analyzed our data using linear models (LM) or, if necessary, using the generalized least squares method (GLS).
4: Data concerning the chemical characterization of flavonoids, catechins, hydroxicinnamic acids, and tannins were analyzed as follows.
5: Normality was verified using the Shapiro-Wilk test and homogeneity of variances was verified by Levene test.
6: Data lacking normality were transformed by i) log transformation (flavonols), ii) square root transformation (hydroxicinnamic acids, tannins), and iii) rank transformation (catechins).
7: One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed on transformed data (in the case of heteroscedasticity, the Welchs correction was applied), and then data were analyzed by the Tukey-Kramer post hoc test (if the assumption of homogeneity of variances was satisfied) or by the Duncans multiple range test (if the assumption of homogeneity of variances was not satisfied) at a significance level of 0.05.
8: All the analyses and graphics were produced using the Software R 1.0.44.
