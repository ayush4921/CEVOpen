0: For each species and for both categories (i.e.
1: ripe and unripe), fruits were further processed using liquid nitrogen and were powdered.
2: A total of 3 g of material was subjected to two different extraction procedures: hydro-alcoholic and aqueous.
3: The hydro-alcoholic procedure was performed by following the method proposed by Amigoni and co-workers 29 without filtering with 0.45 m PTFE filters and with a modified drug/solvent ratio: 3 g of powder were extracted using 30 mL of 70% (v/v) ethanol.
4: The aqueous extraction was performed following the protocol described by Zhu and co-workers 30.
5: Both extractions for each species/fruit category were performed three times.
6: After extraction, solvents were evaporated by a rotary evaporator and then lyophilized.
7: Dry extracts were stored at 20 C until analyses.
