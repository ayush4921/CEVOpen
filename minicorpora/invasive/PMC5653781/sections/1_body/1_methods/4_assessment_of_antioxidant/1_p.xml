<p id="Par17">To evaluate the antioxidant properties of plant extracts, the DPPH assay
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>
 </sup> was performed. Due to the sensitivity of this test to acid and basic pH values
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>
 </sup>, it was verified that the pH of extracts ranged from 4 to 8. Values obtained from unripe and ripe fruit extracts were compared with the extracts of the control species

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>
 </sup> was also performed to verify whether the antioxidant activity of the extracts couldÂ be related to the presence of polyphenols. Results of the DPPH and Folin-Ciocalteau assays were expressed as Trolox and gallic acid (GA) equivalents respectively, by means of calibration curves.
