0: To evaluate the antioxidant properties of plant extracts, the DPPH assay 31 was performed.
1: Due to the sensitivity of this test to acid and basic pH values 32, it was verified that the pH of extracts ranged from 4 to 8.
2: Values obtained from unripe and ripe fruit extracts were compared with the extracts of the control species  V.  myrtillus.
3: Moreover, the Folin-Ciocalteu assay 33 was also performed to verify whether the antioxidant activity of the extracts could be related to the presence of polyphenols.
4: Results of the DPPH and Folin-Ciocalteau assays were expressed as Trolox and gallic acid (GA) equivalents respectively, by means of calibration curves.
