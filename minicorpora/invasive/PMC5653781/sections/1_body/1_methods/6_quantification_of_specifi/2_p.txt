0: The adopted HPLC-DAD separation procedure allowed for the simultaneous analysis of 28 compounds among which stilbenes, phenolic acids, and flavonoids:  trans- and  cis-resveratrol (tRES, cRES),  trans- and  cis-piceid (tPIC, cPIC),  trans- and  cis-resveratroloside (tRDE, cRDE), piceatannol (PICEAT); gallic, protocatechuic, syringic, and vanillic acids (GA, PROTA, SIRA, VANA); caffeic, chlorogenic,  p-coumaric, ferulic, sinapic, and  trans-cinnamic acids (CAFA, CLORA, CUMA, FA, SINA, tCINA); catechin (CAT), epicatechin (EC), epigallocatechin 3-O-gallate (EGCG), epicatechin gallate (ECG), epigallocatechin (EGC); vanillin (VAN), naringenin (NAR), quercetin (QUERC), rutin (RUT), myricetin (MYR), and kaempferol (KAE).
1: Based on SciFinder ( https://scifinder.cas.org/), the average market price of these metabolites was assessed and used to evaluate the potential chemical value of the analyzed fruits.
