0: Biological invasions constitute a global environmental, economic, and social change driver as they can irremediably alter ecosystem compositions and services, thus determining a loss in terms of biodiversity, agriculture productivity, and human health 1,  2.
1: In Europe, the number of invasive species has been rapidly increasing and reached an estimated value of over 12000 species including plants, animals, fungi, and microorganisms in 2016 3.
2: Concerning plants, their intentional introduction for ornamental purposes is a major pathway for invasion 4.
3: The effect of invasive plants on natural ecosystems can be disastrous, firstly for the competition with indigenous species 5, and secondly, because they limit the stability and availability of natural resources to the whole native species community 6,  7.
4: Detrimental effects on human health mediated by invasive plants have also been documented 2.
5: These include the occurrence of immunostimulant substances or allergenic factors, such as those on the pollen of some species or toxic metabolites in fruits, leaves, or other plant portions 8.
6: A typical example is  Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. and  A.  trifida L. which pollens induce respiratory diseases, and management costs to avoid allergy outbreaks are very high 9.
