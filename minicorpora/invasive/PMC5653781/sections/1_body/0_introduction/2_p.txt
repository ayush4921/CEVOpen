0: In the attempt to contrast the risks posed by alien and invasive plant species, management actions have been implemented to prevent introductions 4, eradicate infestations before they become established 10,  11, and contain the spread of abundant or resistant taxa 4,  12  14.
1: In many cases, management strategies (e.g., cutting, mowing and extirpation) are not completely effective, either for eradication or containment purposes, because invasive species rely on efficient dispersal systems ensuring their long-term persistence.
2: Moreover, these strategies demand huge economic resources, not only to assist direct containment, but also for the management of the biomass resulting from extirpation and cutting activities 15.
