0: The technical goal of this study was to explore the chemical and biological properties of fruit from three invasive plants;  Lonicera japonica Thunb.,  Phytolacca americana L., and  Prunus serotina Ehrh.
1: These species produce a large amount of fleshy fruits that are rich in secondary metabolites.
2: Moreover, seeds of these plants represent the main tool for plant invasion and therefore, their collection and disposal for bioprospecting aims, could represent a suitable and innovative strategy for containment purposes.
