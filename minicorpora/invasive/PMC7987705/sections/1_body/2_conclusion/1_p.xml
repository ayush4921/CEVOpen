<p>These three plant hybrids are exposed to the same threats as other plant species in the region (
 <xref rid="B6429193" ref-type="bibr">Heller 2019</xref>). As such, they are losing suitable habitat and their remaining habitat is being fragmented and degraded, mainly due to the encroachment of developement and the action of feral ungulates that roam free across these plant hybrids native range. Conserving these plant hybrids and their parent species and securing their suitable habitat is essential to safeguard these plants across this Caribbean biodiversity hotspot.
