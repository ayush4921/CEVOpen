Throughout the hybrid species range, its suitable habitat is highly fragmented due to the increase in developed areas, mainly for housing, tourism and recreational infrastructure. Road improvements and land clearance, which contribute to habitat fragmentation, have also been observed. Within Gu√°nica State Forest on the island of Puerto Rico, this hybrid might be affected by human induced forest fires which are frequent at this location. Climate change might already be impacting the species through prolonged periods of drought.
