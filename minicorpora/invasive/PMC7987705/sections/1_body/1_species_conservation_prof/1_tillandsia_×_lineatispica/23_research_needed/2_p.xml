<p>Justification for research needed: Detailed surveys across the species range should be undertaken to document precise numbers of mature individuals per subpopulation. Monitoring is required to record phenology of wild populations and 
 <italic>ex-situ</italic> collections should be established to enable detailed studies of the species reproductive structures. Further research into the hybrid and parent species life histories is needed.
