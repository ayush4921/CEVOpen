Development for housing and tourism are further fragmenting suitable habitat throughout the distribution range of the hybrid. Road improvements and installations and land clearance for new development projects, which contribute to habitat fragmentation, have also been observed. Climate change might already be impacting this hybrid through prolonged periods of drought.
