<p>Basis (narrative): Known herbarium collections and recent observations were considered to calculate minimum values of extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO), while maximum values of EOO and AOO were calculated considering the whole island of Tortola in the BVI and the whole island of St John in the USVI, since a detailed distribution for this hybrid is unknown and it is suspected to be widespread across these islands. The extent of occurrence (EOO) was estimated to range between 103 km
 <sup>2</sup> and 207 km
 <sup>2</sup>. The area of occupancy (AOO) was estimated to range between 56 km
 <sup>2</sup> and 188 km
 <sup>2</sup>. Both calculations for EOO and AOO are based on a 2 x 2 km cell size and were calculated with GeoCAT (
