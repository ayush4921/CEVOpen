<p>Justification for number of locations: A minimum number of locations was calculated to be 16, considering threats posed by development, which can vary depending on whether this hybrid is found within or outside protected areas on each island. Field observations suggest that this hybrid is not abundant, but it is possible that further surveys in poorly known areas, such as Anguilla or Dominican Republic, will increase the number of known individuals, as well as the AOO and number of locations.</p>
