<p>Justification for threats: Across its range, development for housing and tourism and impacts from recreational activities are fragmenting the species suitable habitat. Road improvements and land clearance, which contribute to habitat fragmentation, have also been observed. Recreational activities, trail cutting and use of all-terrain vehicles, have also been observed in areas where this species occurs, causing negative impacts on the native vegetation. Climate change might already be impacting this hybrid through prolonged periods of drought, sea level rise and increased intensity of tropical storms.</p>
