<p>Justification for research needed: Conservation research should focus on detailed surveys to document precise numbers per subpopulation. Research into the life history of the hybrid is required to confirm if it is reproductive. Phylogenomic studies and taxonomic revision, which includes material from across the known range of the parent species and the hybrid swarm is needed.</p>
