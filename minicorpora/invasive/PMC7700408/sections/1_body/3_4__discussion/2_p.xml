<p>It is not surprising that the new invasive pest 
 <italic>D. suzuki</italic> was found at the Black Sea Coast of the Caucasus. This region is a hotspot for biological invasions of insects in Russia. In particular, about 30 arboreal pests were discovered there in just the past 10 years (2010–2019): 
 <italic>Paysandisia archon</italic> Burmeister (Lepidoptera: Castniidae), 
 <italic>Rhynchophorus ferrugineus</italic> (Olivier) (Coleoptera: Rhynchophoridae), 
 <italic>Ceroplastes ceriferus</italic> (Fabricius) (Homoptera: Pseudococcidae), 
 <italic>Glyphodes pyloalis</italic> Walker (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), 
 <italic>Dasineura gleditchiae</italic> (Osten Sacken) (Diptera: Cecidomiidae), 
 <italic>Lamprodila (Palmar) festiva</italic> (Linnaeus) (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), 
 <italic>Phyllonorycter robiniella</italic> (Clemens) (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae), 
 <italic>Halyomorpha halys</italic> (Stål) (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae) and others [

The high number of invasions to the Black Sea Coast of the Caucasus is probably connected with the unique combination of factors that facilitate biological invasions. First, the climate in this region is wet subtropical, and therefore favorable to the establishment of alien insect species from other parts of the world with a similar climate. Second, the Black Sea Coast of Russia is one of the main sea resort regions of Russia. Trains and airplanes from all over the country bring there about ten million people every year. As such, the probability of the unintentional introduction of pests from different areas to the resort region is very high. Insect pests could be introduced as stowaways in transport, as contaminants with food products and other goods of animal and plant origin, and especially with planting material. It should be noted that the urban plantings in the city of Sochi and other resort cities of the region consist mainly of exotic plant species. Large numbers of seedlings, bulbs, and seeds are imported to the region every year. In particular, intensive landscaping of the streets and parks was conducted in preparation for the Olympic Games in 2014 [
