0: Drosophila suzukii is also spreading in the Black Sea region.
1: In 2014, it was first recorded for Crimea [ 34] and East Turkey [ 30] and three years later, in 2017, in the Adjara Region in southeastern Georgia [ 35].
2: Based on these data, we hypothesized that  D. suzukii could also spread to the Black Sea Coast of the Russian Caucasus.
3: We performed field surveys that confirmed this hypothesis.
4: Herein, we report the first records of  D. suzukii in European Russia, namely in Sochi.
5: This city is located a great distance from the previously known localities of  D. suzukii in the surrounding regions: About 500 km from Crimea, about 450 km from east Turkey, and about 250 km from Adjara.
