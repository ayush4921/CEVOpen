0: Spotted-wing drosophila,  Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura, 1931), is one of the most important invasive pests of fruit and wine production worldwide [ 3].
1: This species damages cherry, peach, and plums ( Prunus spp., Rosaceae); raspberry and blackberry ( Rubus spp., Rosaceae), strawberry ( Fragaria spp., Rosaceae); blueberry ( Vaccinium spp., Ericaceae); grape ( Vitis spp., Vitaceae); and other soft fruits.
2: Drosophila suzukii has a wide host range compared to many other drosophila, and in Western Europe (Italy, Switzerland, the Netherlands),  D. suzukii has been recorded to feed on 84 species of plants in 19 families [ 4].
3: The economic damage caused by this species has prompted numerous studies regarding its biology and control; for instance, a special issue of the  Journal of Pest Science was devoted to this species [ 5].
4: The harmful effects of fruit flies are not limited to just economic damage, and  Drosophila larvae have been reported to cause intestinal myiasis in humans [ 6].
5: Unlike other fruit flies,  D. suzukii will oviposit and develop in healthy ripening soft fruits.
6: This increases the danger of  D. suzukii to human health, as the consumption of what appear to be normal fruits that contain drosophila larvae can lead to conditions such as intestinal myiasis.
