<p>Spotted-wing drosophila, 
 <italic>Drosophila suzukii</italic> (Matsumura, 1931), is one of the most important invasive pests of fruit and wine production worldwide [
 <xref rid="B3-insects-11-00826" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This species damages cherry, peach, and plums (
 <italic>Prunus</italic> spp., Rosaceae); raspberry and blackberry (
 <italic>Rubus</italic> spp., Rosaceae), strawberry (
 <italic>Fragaria</italic> spp., Rosaceae); blueberry (
 <italic>Vaccinium</italic> spp., Ericaceae); grape (
 <italic>Vitis</italic> spp., Vitaceae); and other soft fruits. 
 <italic>Drosophila suzukii</italic> has a wide host range compared to many other drosophila, and in Western Europe (Italy, Switzerland, the Netherlands), 
 <italic>D. suzukii</italic> has been recorded to feed on 84 species of plants in 19 families [
 <xref rid="B4-insects-11-00826" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The economic damage caused by this species has prompted numerous studies regarding its biology and control; for instance, a special issue of the 
 <italic>Journal of Pest Science</italic> was devoted to this species [
 <xref rid="B5-insects-11-00826" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The harmful effects of fruit flies are not limited to just economic damage, and 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae have been reported to cause intestinal myiasis in humans [
 <xref rid="B6-insects-11-00826" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Unlike other fruit flies, 
 <italic>D. suzukii</italic> will oviposit and develop in healthy ripening soft fruits. This increases the danger of 
 <italic>D. suzukii</italic> to human health, as the consumption of what appear to be normal fruits that contain drosophila larvae can lead to conditions such as intestinal myiasis.
