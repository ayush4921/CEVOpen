<p>As the molecular basis of tissue adhesion between different family species, it is proposed that a subclade of ß-1,4-glucanases, called GH9B3, has an important role to accomplish cell-cell adhesion at the grafted interface. Transcriptome analysis of interfamily grafting revealed many other genes associated with cell wall modifications as upregulated genes during grafting, on 1 to 7 d after grafting or later. Such studies of graft-related genes will provide further information about graft healing processes and have a good potential to improve grafting techniques. In such studies, extraction of commonality between natural parasitism and grafting is one of the effective ways to reveal crucial physiology and identify key genes from a large number of wound response genes.</p>
