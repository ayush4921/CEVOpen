<p>In nature, parasitism by vascular plants is a manifestation of another tissue adhesion between different plant species [
 <xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Despite the phylogenetic distance, many parasitic plants have evolved the ability to parasitize distantly related plant species beyond the family. Thus, tissue adhesion events between plant species occur naturally. Through the invasive haustorium, a specialized organ for parasitizing, parasitic plants can absorb nutrients from the host plants through the hostâ€“haustorium interface [
 <xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. We therefore hypothesized that the ability of tissue adhesion in parasitic plants may expand to the interfamily grafting, and we showed that it is true [
 <xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In interfamily grafting of a parasitic plant, 
 <italic>P. japonicum</italic>, both apoplastic and symplasmic transports were established at the grafting junction. Since plant parasitism has evolved independently at least 12 times in angiosperm [
 <xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], therefore these plants can potentially acquire the ability of tissue adhesion with distant plant species.
