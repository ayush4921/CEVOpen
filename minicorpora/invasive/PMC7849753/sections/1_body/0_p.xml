<p>Plant grafting has been applied to improved crop traits for millennia [
 <xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Grafting establishment is dependent on wound healing processes, including early wound response, cell proliferation at the wound cite, cell-cell adhesion, cell differentiation and stabilization through establishment of reconnected tissues [
 <xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2â€“4</xref>]. This healing event at the graft wound site is composed of such sequential biological processes. Therefore, the grafting is accomplished only between same species or closely related species. The compatibility of grafting, in other word, is generally observed between species within the same genus, less between different genera, and rarely observed among different families. This principle is therefore reasonable if consider the underlined biological processes.
