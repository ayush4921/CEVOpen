<p>However, in the long history of grafting, exceptional interfamily grafting combinations have been observed [
 <xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5–9</xref>]. We have also recently confirmed that exceptional grafting of 
 <italic>Nicotiana</italic> species with plants from distant families is possible [
 <xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. 
 <italic>Nicotiana</italic> species established interfamily grafting with 38 other families. In 
 <italic>Nicotiana</italic> interfamily grafting, apoplastic and symplasmic transports were established at 3 d after grafting or later, although the level of transport was not high. These observations indicate that tissue connections were partially reconstructed after cell-cell adhesion.
