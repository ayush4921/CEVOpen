0: Among-population phenotypic differentiation in the wild is effectively estimated using  PST (i.e., the phenotypic analogue of  QST); [ 22, 23, 24].
1: Lande (1992) [ 25] stated that genetic variance in phenotypic traits between populations is expected to equal that of variation in neutral molecular loci under the influence of the forces that drive evolution.
2: Indeed, the level of differentiation of quantitative traits should be similar to the level of differentiation at neutral loci, as divergent selection in quantitative traits induces more morphological differences than would be expected for neutral molecular markers [ 24].
3: For this reason, a valuable method for investigating morphological differences between invasive and natural populations of IAS is to compare divergence in allele frequencies to divergence in quantitative traits.
4: Whether selection or genetic drift is responsible for phenotypic divergence is a complex task and requires the initial step of comparing genetic differentiation with phenotypic differentiation.
5: Phenotypic differences between populations are often assumed to be adaptive, and epigenetics are reported to play key role on adaptation of invasive species [ 26].
6: Both molecular and quantitative variations can be influenced by non-adaptive processes that involve random genetic drift and gene flow [ 27, 28].
7: Under these conditions, it would be especially challenging and interesting to determine whether phenotypic differences between populations represent the outcomes of adaptive or non-adaptive processes.
