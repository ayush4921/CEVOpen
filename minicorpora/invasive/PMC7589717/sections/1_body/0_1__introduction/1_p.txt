0: The spread of invasive alien species (IAS) has received a great deal of attention, given the adverse ecological and economic effects that they can impose on invaded ecosystems [ 1, 2].
1: Why invasive species expand their range faster in non-native regions, but not in their native range, and how these species become dominant components of non-native habitats while being minor constituents of their native ecosystems [ 3] are still open questions.
2: Alien plants are those plants that have been introduced to an area from their native range, either accidentally or intentionally, whereas invasive plants are those plants that are non-native to an ecosystem and which may cause a threat to native biodiversity and ecosystem integrity in many ecologically sensitive parts of the world.
3: Very recently, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has come up with a standard Environmental Impact Classification of Alien Taxa (EICAT), based on the magnitude of the detrimental environmental impacts.
4: Earlier studies have indicated that invasive species often possess specific demographic or physiological traits, such as faster growth rates, greater productivity, high fecundity, greater tolerance to environmental extreme events, or very effective dispersal compared to native and non-invasive introduced species [ 4, 5, 6, 7].
5: These traits enable introduced species to spread very extensively and achieve high abundance.
6: The origin of such variations in traits that influence success in competition between invasive and native species under natural conditions may include geographic isolation, genetic drift, divergent selection, phenotypic plasticity [ 8], and rapid adaptive evolution [ 9, 10].
7: Whether phenotypic divergence among and between populations of alien species is due to one or more of these factors is a debate that remains to be resolved.
