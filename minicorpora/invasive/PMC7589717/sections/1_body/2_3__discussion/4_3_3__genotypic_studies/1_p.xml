<p>After obtaining useful insights into phenotypic trait-based variations in native and invasive populations’ vis-à-vis invasiveness in 
 <italic>P. australis</italic>, our objective was to confirm such variations at molecular level. Results from the present study indicate that in general, highest levels of genetic diversity are found in invasive populations, while the lowest levels of diversity are recorded in native population, consistent with [
 <xref rid="B72-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. The highest levels of genetic diversity in invasive populations may explain adaptability of invaders in non-native habitats [
 <xref rid="B9-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The low levels of genetic diversity in the only one native population that was identified in the present study are congruent with the results of [
 <xref rid="B73-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], which observed lower levels of genetic diversity in native 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> populations than in invaders at many of cpDNA loci. This is contrary to what was observed by Zhao et al. [
 <xref rid="B74-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], who reported highest genetic diversity among native Mexican populations of 
 <italic>Solanum rostratum</italic> Dunal and significantly reduced diversity in invasive populations within the USA and China, using ten microsatellite markers. Since cpDNA PCR-RFLP haplotype identification analyses in the present study revealed only one native population, instead of five as thought on the basis of morphological variations, and all the other populations are exotic, it seems that invasion has either replaced the native populations or intraspecific hybridization might have occurred between native and introduced lineages of a species that has increased invasiveness and lead to the decline of native lineages [
 <xref rid="B54-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. We suggest that a broad-scale study including more continents than what has been done in our study, after identifying more native populations, be carried out to confirm or refute our findings.
