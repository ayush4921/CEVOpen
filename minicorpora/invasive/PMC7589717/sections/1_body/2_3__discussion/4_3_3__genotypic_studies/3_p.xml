<p>Our results indicate that 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> populations that were studied are structured, which is in agreement with Guo et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. While the latter study revealed the presence of substructures to delineate the population structure in common reed, Guo et al. [
 <xref rid="B81-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>] postulated that the climatic niche had shifted between the native and introduced populations of the invasive European lineage. The authors reported strong effects of geography and environment on the genetic structure of populations in the native range, but these effects were counteracted by human-related factors manifested through colonization of anthropogenic habitats in the introduced range. Another possible explanation of the substructures observed in our study may be borrowed from Albert et al. [
 <xref rid="B63-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], who while investigating the reproduction of 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> in eastern North America proposed that long-distance seed dispersal is imperative for common reed along roadsides and in marshes; whereas, plant fragments as well as seeds were shown to be important for dispersal to short distances along roads at least in the areas of its abundance. Further, robust reproductive strategy, both through sexual and asexual modes, was shown to mainly contribute to the invasive success of this species in North America. Our phylogenetic analysis easily identified three mains groups, with each group showing clear specificity in terms of the investigated traits.
