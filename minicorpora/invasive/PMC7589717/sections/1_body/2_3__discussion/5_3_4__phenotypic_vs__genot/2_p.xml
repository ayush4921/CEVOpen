<p>The among-population phenotypic divergence that was observed in this study regardless of region is not surprising and may be explained by several factors, including plasticity, genetic drift, and divergent selection. As

 <sub>ST</sub> for six out of seven studied characters, divergent selection appears as the most probable cause of among-populations difference in quantitative traits [
 <xref rid="B84-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. No apparent physical barrier to gene flow existed between sampled populations within the region, suggesting that genetic barriers such as different ploidy levels or the high rate of local lateral vegetative propagation of the species may explain the reduced gene flow among populations. Results from the present study are in contrast with that of [
 <xref rid="B30-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], which investigated patterns of differentiation in nine microsatellite loci in 
 <italic>P. australis</italic>. Whether the observed phenotypic divergence in 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> populations is heritable is not known. Investigating fine-scale local spatial invasions (i.e., within geographic regions) would certainly shed more light on the possible contributions of plasticity to patterns of among-population phenotypic variation in
