<p>Abundant flowering may also play an important role in reproductive success, which obviously influences propagule pressure and invasiveness. Our results that invasive plants in both regions significantly produce more flowers and seeds than native plants are quite striking. These traits can be taken as the indicator/s of plant invasiveness. In a survey of 46 native and 45 introduced populations of
