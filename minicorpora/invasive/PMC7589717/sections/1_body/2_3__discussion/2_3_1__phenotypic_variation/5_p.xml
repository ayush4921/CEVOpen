<p>Comparing the leaf characteristics of invasive and native populations showed that the former exhibit higher values for leaf area than the latter. Bimodal distribution observed for traits related to stem diameter, internode distance, leaf length, and width suggest that a major gene controls those four important characters related to leaf and stem sizes in 
 <italic>P. australis</italic>. Although there was not significant among-population variation in leaf width, results from the present study revealed maximum leaf length and leaf width for invasive populations, while the lowest values were encountered in native population. Furthermore, variation in leaf width was very highly significant between haplotypes in the present study, with invaders appearing to perform better with respect to this quantitative trait as well. Successful invaders are characterized by a wider range of leaf areas and by greater phenotypic plasticity [
