<p>Given the premise that the invasive populations perform better than native ones in terms of various growth-related traits, we found the highest values of seven growth-related traits of 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> within invasive populations. These results are congruent with that of other studies [

 <xref rid="B49-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], although DeVrie et al. [
 <xref rid="B50-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] indicated that morphological characters cannot discriminate reliably between invasive and native 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> individuals in North America. Further, local environment highly affects phenotypic traits in common reed [
 <xref rid="B51-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], explaining the difficulty in differentiating invasive and native individuals from these traits. However, plasticity in common reed is trait-specific [

 <xref rid="B52-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Similarly, Pysek et al. [
 <xref rid="B53-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] compared the functional traits of 89 populations in a common garden experiment belonging to distinct clones of different origin: North America, Europe, Australia (two groups including native and invasive populations introduced from Europe), South Africa, and Far East. In general, both native and invasive populations with origins in Europe showed highest performance-related traits than other groups. North American native populations performed more poorly than both European-related groups and were similar in this respect to Australian and South African populations [
 <xref rid="B53-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Invasive European populations in North America do suppress the native North American populations wherever growing in direct competition [
 <xref rid="B54-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The weaker performance of Australian and South African populations in the Northern Hemisphere is due to weak genetic differences or environmental similarities [
