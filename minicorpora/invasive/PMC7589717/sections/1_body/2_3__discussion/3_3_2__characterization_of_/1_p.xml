<p>The characterization of among-haplotype variation could provide clues on co-selection of traits in case hitchhiking occurs [
 <xref rid="B71-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Indeed, a group of characters may distinguish closely related taxa, which are geographically distant, because of genetic drift or hitchhiking. Similar effects are also observed when a major gene controls the characters of interest. Results of the present study revealed that at least stem diameter, leaf length, and width may undergo co-selection or the traits are under the control of the major gene. Genome-wide association studies in the species may provide more insights on the issue.
