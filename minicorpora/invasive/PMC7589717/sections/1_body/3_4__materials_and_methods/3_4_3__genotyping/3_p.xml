<p>Two PCR protocols with different annealing temperatures were used during this study (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01392-t008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>): (1) Amplification conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 3 min followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C annealing for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, and a final extension of 72 °C for 5 min for loci PaGT 4 with PaGT 14, and loci PaGT 8 with PaGT 13, PaGT 9, and PaGT 12; (2) Amplification conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 4 min followed by 31 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 56 °C annealing for 2 min, 72 °C for 1 min, and a final extension of 72 °C for 2 min for loci PaGT 11, PaGT 16, and PaGT 22. Fragments were measured using an ABI PRISM 3130XL Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and scored using Gene mapper v4.0 software (Applied Biosystems).
