<p>To assess the genetic diversity within and among populations of native and invasive 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> across regions, we used a set of 9 cpDNA microsatellite loci, 
 <italic>viz</italic>., PaGT-4, PaGT-8, PaGT-9, PaGT-11, PaGT-12, PaGT-13, PaGT-14, PaGT-16, and PaGT-22, which were developed by Saltonstall (

 <xref rid="B30-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Amplifications were performed as two multiplexes and five single reactions, each in a total volume of 15 µl containing 50 ng of template DNA, 0.5 mM each of the two forward and reverse primers, 0.2mM dNTPs (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies, New York, NY, USA), 1.5 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>,1x PCR buffer (10 mMTris, pH 8.0, 50 m MKCl, and 50 mM ammonium sulphate; Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 0.5 mM Fluorochrome (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies), and 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Sigma-Aldrich). Multiplexes PCR employed an annealing temperature of 55 °C and amplified loci PaGT 4 with PaGT 14, and loci PaGT 8 with PaGT 13. Single PCR employed an annealing temperature of 55 °C for loci PaGT 9 and PaGT 12, and 56 °C for loci PaGT 11, PaGT 16, and PaGT 22. Single PCRs were subjected to the same reaction conditions as the multiplexes (
