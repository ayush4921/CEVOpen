0: To verify whether  P. australis individuals belonged to native or to introduced genotypes, a cpDNA PCR-RFLP analysis that had been developed by Saltonstall [ 41] was used.
1: Briefly, two non-coding regions of the chloroplast genome [ trnT (UGU)- trnL (UAA) and  rbcL- psaI] were amplified using the primers described by Saltonstall [ 41].
2: PCR products were digested using the restriction enzyme  RsaI for the  trnLb region and  HhaI for the  rbcL region following the manufacturers protocol (Promega, Madison, WI).
3: Restriction fragments were electrophoresed in ethidium bromide-stained 3% TAE agarose gels and visualized using UV light.
4: We also searched for matches with a Blast tool provided by NCBI.
5: To confirm the results, PCR products were sequenced on an ABI 16-capillary genetic analyzer 3130XL (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).
6: Sequences were edited and aligned using BioEdit version 7.0.5 [ 90].
7: The BLASTn algorithm [ 91] was used to query GenBank (NCBI) to determine the closest  P. austalis haplotype.
8: Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using MEGA 7 software [ 92], and the Neighbour-Joining (NJ) method [ 93].
