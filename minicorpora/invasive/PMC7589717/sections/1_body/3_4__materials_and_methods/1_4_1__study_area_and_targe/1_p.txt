0: The target species for the present study was  P. australis.
1: We specifically studied wild, alien invasive  P. australis populations in the province of Quebec, Canada and Kashmir Himalaya, India ( Figure 6 and  Figure 7), in addition to five putative native populations of this species in Quebec that were assumed to be native.
2: Information about nativity and distributional range of the species was obtained from web-based sources, such as the Germplasm Resource Information Network (GRIN;  http://www.ars-grin.gov/), the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA Agricultural Research Service 2015  http://plants.usda.gov/ [ 85]), and the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (USDA Germplasm Resources Information Network  https://doi.org/10.15482/USDA.ADC/1212393 [ 86]).
3: However, information about the native populations in Quebec were obtained from the specimens of the target species that were stored in the two main herbaria of Quebec, viz., Louis-Marie Herbarium (QFA, Universite Laval) and Marie-Victorin Herbarium (MT, Institut de recherche en biologie vegetale, Universite de Montreal), together with those held in the Kashmir University Herbarium (KASH), and the list of native populations provided by Lavoie et al.
4: [ 87] onwards were also consulted.
