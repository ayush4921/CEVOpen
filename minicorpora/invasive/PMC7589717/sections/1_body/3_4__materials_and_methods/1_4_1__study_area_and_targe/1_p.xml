<p>The target species for the present study was 
 <italic>P. australis</italic>. We specifically studied wild, alien invasive 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> populations in the province of Quebec, Canada and Kashmir Himalaya, India (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01392-f007">Figure 7</xref>), in addition to five putative native populations of this species in Quebec that were assumed to be native. Information about nativity and distributional range of the species was obtained from web-based sources, such as the Germplasm Resource Information Network (GRIN;

However, information about the native populations in Quebec were obtained from the specimens of the target species that were stored in the two main herbaria of Quebec, viz., Louis-Marie Herbarium (QFA, Université Laval) and Marie-Victorin Herbarium (MT, Institut de recherche en biologie végétale, Université de Montréal), together with those held in the Kashmir University Herbarium (KASH), and the list of native populations provided by Lavoie et al. [
 <xref rid="B87-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] onwards were also consulted.
