0: A total of 16 populations ( Table 6) were investigated in Kashmir and Quebec for morphological traits, including five populations that were invasive to Kashmir; six putative populations that were invasive to Quebec, and five putative native populations in Quebec on the basis of morphometric traits [ 88].
1: Twenty-five individual plants, which were separated by at least 10 m from one another to increase the likelihood that they were distinct genets [ 62], were collected in each population.
2: Morphological traits that were targeted in the present study included stem diameter, plant height, leaf length, leaf width, and internode length ( Table 7).
3: The status of populations (invasive or native) was recorded in the field based on morphological differences between plants [ 88].
