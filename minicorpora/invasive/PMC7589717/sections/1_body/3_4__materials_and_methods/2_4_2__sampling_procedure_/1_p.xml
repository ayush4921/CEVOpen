<p>A total of 16 populations (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01392-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>) were investigated in Kashmir and Quebec for morphological traits, including five populations that were invasive to Kashmir; six putative populations that were invasive to Quebec, and five putative native populations in Quebec on the basis of morphometric traits [
 <xref rid="B88-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Twenty-five individual plants, which were separated by at least 10 m from one another to increase the likelihood that they were distinct genets [
 <xref rid="B62-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], were collected in each population. Morphological traits that were targeted in the present study included stem diameter, plant height, leaf length, leaf width, and internode length (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01392-t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>). The status of populations (invasive or native) was recorded in the field based on morphological differences between plants [
