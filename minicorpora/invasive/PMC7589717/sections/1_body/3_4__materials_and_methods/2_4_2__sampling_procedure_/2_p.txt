0: A total of 20 populations were sampled in this study for genetic study, including nine populations from Kashmir and eleven populations from Quebec ( Table 6).
1: We designated only one population out of 20 populations as native, using cpDNA PCR-RFLP analysis.
2: Collection sites in each region were separated by distances of 10100 km.
3: At each site, we collected one population, and, within each population, 25 individual plants were collected for molecular analysis.
4: Fresh leaf samples (each about 1 cm 2 in area) were collected in tubes with desiccant and kept frozen at 20 C prior to DNA extraction.
5: Genomic DNA from plant species was extracted using the CTAB method [ 89].
