0: Then, the phylogenetic tree was constructed using genetic distance (neighbor joining algorithm) of the 20 populations of  P. australis using Phylip and Mega 6 software.
1: Relationships between genetic and geographic distance were investigated using Mantel tests in the Isolation By Distance Web Service (IBDWS 3.23; [ 109]).
2: Mantel Statistics was performed using 10,000 permutations to evaluate correlation between genetic and geographic distance.
