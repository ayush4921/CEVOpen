0: Given that  P. australis plants sampled in this study were of different ploidy levels, descriptive statistics were performed using Polysat version 1.3 [ 101].
1: These statistics included the percentage of polymorphic loci ( P), the mean number of alleles ( A), the mean number of alleles per polymorphic locus ( Ap), allelic richness ( AR), and observed and expected heterozygosities ( HO and  HE) for each population [ 102], together with unbiased estimates of population differentiation for microsatellites ( RST; [ 103]).
2: Prior to analysis of molecular data, gametic disequilibrium verification between loci was performed using Fishers exact tests.
3: Bruvo distances [ 104] were estimated between genotypes using Polysat version 1.3 and principal coordinates analysis was used to display population structure, using R package [ 105].
4: To measure the informative character of the SSR markers that were used in the present study, the polymorphism information contents (PIC) for each marker was calculated using as follows [ 106]: PIC = 1    i=1k P  i2(4) where k is the total number of alleles detected per locus and P i the frequency of the allele i in all populations.
5: Genetic similarity (GS) [ 107] was calculated as follows: GS = 2N  ij/(N  i + N  j)  (5) where N ij is the number of fragments common to individuals i and j, and (Ni + Nj) is the total number of fragments in both individuals.
