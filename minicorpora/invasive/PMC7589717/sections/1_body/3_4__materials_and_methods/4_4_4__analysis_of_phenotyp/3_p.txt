0: Similarity among different  P. australis populations and population groups was calculated using Euclidean distance performed on standardized variables [ 97], while hierarchical cluster analysis between populations was carried out on distance values using the R package pvclust [ 98].
1: We characterized haplotypes and plotted the phenotypic distribution for each trait using the R ggpubr program [ 99].
2: Principal components analysis (PCA) with phenotypic traits was applied to examine the pattern of phylogeographic groups, and how close they were to each other.
3: PCA was performed using the Facto Mine R package [ 100].
