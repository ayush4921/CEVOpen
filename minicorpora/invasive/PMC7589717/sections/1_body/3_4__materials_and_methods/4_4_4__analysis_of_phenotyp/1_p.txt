0: Variance components were estimated in the Statistical Analysis System [ 94] with Proc Mixed using the restricted maximum likelihood analysis.
1: Haplotype effects were fixed whereas region, population, and plant effects were assumed to be random, and data analyses were performed using the statistical model for a three-stage nested design [ 95]: Y  ijkl =  +   i +   j(k) +   (ij)k + e  (ijk)l(1) where Y ijkl is the average value for the dependent variable for the  ith region (Quebec or Kashmir), for the  jth population nested in the  ith region, for the  kth haplotype (invasive or native) nested in the  jth population and further in the  ith region, and for the  lth plant nested in the  kth  P. australis haplotype nested in the  jth population further nested in the  ith region;  is the overall mean;  i,  j(k),  (ij)k and e (ijk)l corresponded, respectively, to region effect (i.e., the between-region variance), to population effect (i.e., the among-population variance), to haplotype effect (i.e., the between-haplotype variance), and to plant effect (i.e., the within-population variance), the last term being the source of experimental error in the model.
2: Post hoc multiple comparison of means was performed using Duncan Multiple Range Tests.
3: PST values for each measured character were estimated using the following formula [ 22, 96]: PST =   VAP/(  VAP + 2  VWP)  (2) where  VAP is the among-population variance and  VWP the within-population variance.
