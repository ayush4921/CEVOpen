<p>Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated two principal components with eigen-values greater than 1. The PCA grouped the seven 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> descriptors into various components, with the first two explaining 79.33% of the variation, while the first principal axis (PC1) alone explained 61.84% of the variation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01392-f003">Figure 3</xref>). The PC1 had high loading for leaf width. The second axis (PC2), explaining about 17.49% of the total variation, was correlated with plant height, stem diameter, fresh flowers and seeds, dry flowers, and seeds, internode length, and leaf length, indicating the usefulness of descriptors in
