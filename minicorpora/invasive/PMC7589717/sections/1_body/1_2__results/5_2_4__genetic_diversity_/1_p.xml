 <xref rid="plants-09-01392-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Based on the number of alleles, it was found that 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> in Kashmir shows hexaploidy as the number of alleles from each population ranged from 1–6; for Quebec populations, it shows tetraploidy as the number of alleles ranged from 1–4. However, Quebec native population plants seem to be diploid, having only 1–2 alleles (

 <xref rid="plants-09-01392-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. The mean number of alleles per locus ranged from 1.89 to 4.56, and the overall mean number of alleles per locus amounted to 8.56. The mean number of alleles per polymorphic locus ranged from 1.61 to 3.37, whereas the overall mean number of alleles per polymorphic locus amounted to 4.16 (

 <sub>p</sub> was not as wide in the Quebec populations, and respectively, 1.89 to 3.56, and 1.61 to 2.32. Mean percentages of polymorphic loci ranged from 66.67% (KE9, Ganderbal, Kashmir) to 100% (KE1, KE4, KE5, KE6, KE7, and KE8) for Kashmir populations. For the Quebec populations, 
 <italic>P</italic> ranged from 88.89% (QE1, QE3, QE6, QE8, QE9, QE12, and QN1) to 100% (QE4, QE7, QE10, and QE11). The overall percentage of polymorphic loci was 92.78% for all study populations. Allelic richness for Kashmiri and Quebec populations ranged from 1.81 to 2.54, and 1.54 to 2.18, respectively.
