<p>Restriction fragment length polymorphism (hereafter, RFLP) analysis confirmed that there was only one native population (QN1) in our sampled populations, instead of five as thought based on morphological variations. In utilizing the cpDNA PCR-RFLP analyses, we found that the Quebec population QN1 shared the same restriction pattern as native populations in USA [
 <xref rid="B41-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Further, we found that ten populations (QE1 to QE12) exhibited the same restriction sites as haplotype M [
 <xref rid="B42-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Results for the sequence 
 <italic>trnT</italic>-
 <italic>trnL</italic> in the native Quebec QN1 population was 99% similar to haplotype E2 (NCBI accession no. AY016325; [
 <xref rid="B42-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]). Sequence 
 <italic>trnT</italic>-
 <italic>trnL</italic> in the invasive Quebec QE1 population and sequence 
 <italic>trnT</italic>-
 <italic>trnL</italic> in the Kashmir KE1 population were 99% similar to haplotype 4 (NCBI accession no. AY016327; [
 <xref rid="B42-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]). BLAST analysis was done in GenBank NCBI database for the 
 <italic>rbcL</italic>-
 <italic>psa</italic>I intergenic spacer, and for native Quebec QN1, the sequence was identical to haplotype E2 (100% identity with NCBI accession no. JQ409547; Freeland and Vachon Unpublished data). Sequence 
 <italic>rbcL</italic>-
 <italic>psa</italic>I in the invasive Quebec QE1 population was 99% similar to haplotype 4, while Kashmir KE1 population was identical (100% similar) to the same sequence of haplotype 4 (NCBI accession no. AY016335, [
 <xref rid="B42-plants-09-01392" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]). All nine populations from Kashmir displayed the same restriction pattern as haplotype M. Based on this information, we considered the putative native Quebec populations of Lac St-Louis, Parc Louis-Racine, Sablière Colette, and La Pocatière as invasive 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> populations, referring to them instead as QE9, QE10, QE11, and QE12.
