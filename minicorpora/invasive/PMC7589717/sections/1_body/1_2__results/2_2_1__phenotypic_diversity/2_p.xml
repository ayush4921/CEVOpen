<p>Highly significant variation was observed among plants, whereas significant to highly significant variation was found among populations for the measured characters, except for leaf width (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01392-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The variation between individual plants and between populations most often contributed to the bulk of total variation in the measured characters, except for leaf width (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01392-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Additionally, among-populations variation was higher than between-haplotypes variation for all the characters that were measured (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01392-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). While 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> plants from Kashmir had more highly significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) heavier flower dry mass (3.59 ± 0.59 g) than did Quebec plants (2.55 ± 0.116 g), invasive 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> plants had significantly wider leaves (2.04 ± 0.036 cm) than did native plants (1.65 ± 0.05 cm). Additionally, except for flower and dry seeds mass, no variation was found among regions for all measured characters (
