<p>High genetic differentiation was observed among populations (overall 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>ST</sub> = 0.353), ranging from 0.133 between invasive populations from Kashmir and Quebec, to 0.418 between Quebec native and invasive populations. These differences were best illustrated by the results of principal coordinate analysis (

 <italic>P. australis</italic> plants separated into three groups: Kashmir invasive, Quebec natives, and Quebec invasive, which each formed one group (
