<p>The present suggestion of the existence of fungal-like amyloid NLR signalosomes points at a more general aspect of NLR function and evolution in prokaryotes and fungi. There is experimental support for the role of NLRs in fungi in the control of regulated cell death and host defence (at least in the context of allorecognition) [
 <xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. If these putative bacterial amyloid signalosomes, but also other proteins with NLR architectures (which are also overrepresented in multicellular bacteria), function in host defence processes then a re-evaluation of the evolutionary trajectory of NLRs in the control of immunity would be required. Instead of explaining the common occurrence of NLRs in plant and vertebrate immunity as a result of convergent evolution [
 <xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], a scenario of long-term conservation of this architecture for the regulation of biotic interactions across the tree-of-life would have to be favoured [
