<p>Functional amyloids in bacteria have been foremost described as constituents of biofilms [
 <xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Yet, our recent analyses uncovered that filamentous bacteria, mainly actinobacteria and cyanobacteria, carry two-gene clusters encoding for an NLR-like sensor and its downstream effector protein, which share a common signal-transducing amyloid motif. These findings suggest that amyloid NLR signalosomes occur in both eukaryotes (fungi) and prokaryotes (bacteria). While in fungi the amyloid signalling controls regulated cell death, which appears evolutionary related to mammalian necroptosis [
 <xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], the outcome of the signalling process in filamentous bacteria remains to be explored. However, it has been hypothesized that similar to the role it plays in fungi, NLR-dependent amyloid signalling represents or is integral to programmed cell death pathways in prokaryotes [
 <xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Future work will elucidate the extent of similarity in regards to the downstream responses of amyloid-dependent signalling between distant phylogenetic groups and likely provide additional support for a common and extremely ancient evolutionary origin of amyloid-controlled cell death. In this context, the RHIM-related amyloid motifs hold a central stage as a signalling amyloid domain common to mammals and their viruses [
 <xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], flies [
 <xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], fungi [
 <xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and prokaryotes [
 <xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The structure of the necrosome – a heterotypic RHIM-based amyloid formed by the RHIM domains of the RIPK1 and RIPK3 kinases – has recently been resolved [
 <xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Our recent discovery that mammalian RHIM motifs can propagate as prions and cross-seed with the fungal PP-based prion amyloids and BASS3 bacterial amyloids [
 <xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] indicates a conserved signalling specificity and suggests, in the frame of the amyloid templating paradigm, that a degree of structural similarity exists between these signalling amyloids. Further structural exploration between these signalling amyloids would be of great interest considering that the short amyloidogenic domains are not found in similar protein architectures, specifically in mammalian signalling compared to fungi and prokaryotes. It is conceivable that some amyloid domains, like RHIM, had have higher evolutionary success due to their adaptability to form signalling complexes in a variety of protein architectures and are not strictly limited to the adaptor N-terminal domains of NLRs or the C-terminus of execution proteins. In particular, RHIM might be able in contrast to the other motifs to function in a central position as opposed to N or C-terminal positions. The fact that RHIM-like motifs also occur in Drosophila and viruses, in different protein architectures and in a central position, tends to support this view [
 <xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In turn, it must be realized that the bioinformatics approaches used to identify amyloid motifs in fungi and bacteria are biased to identify motifs occurring in the NLR/executor architectures. Further genome mining approaches to identify amyloidogenic motifs with redefined criteria would be welcome and could help answer three key questions about the phylogenetic distribution of the signalling amyloids. Are there signalling amyloids in fungi and bacteria, in proteins and signalling pathways not dependent on NLRs? Is the RHIM motif the only signalling amyloid in metazoans (and their viruses) and can the amyloid signalling paradigm be extended to other taxa, notably plants and Archaea? While experimental validation is required, it is of note that some of the amyloid motifs occurring in bacteria also occur in Archaea genomes and specifically in multicellular species [
 <xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The answers to these questions would bring more clarity on where we stand now in regards to diversity, abundance and distribution for this class of functional amyloids.
