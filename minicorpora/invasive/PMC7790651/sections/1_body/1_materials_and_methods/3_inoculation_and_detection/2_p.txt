0: The fungus JK99 was previously isolated from healthy leaves of  A. adenophora, making up nearly 30% of the total isolated fungi (Mei et al.,  2014).
1: It has been identified as  Colletotrichum sp.
2: (see colony morphology in Figure  S1.
3: Its ITS gene was sequenced and was completely identical to the sequence of a strain of  Colletotrichum sp.
4: A285 that we previously submitted to GenBank with an accession number of MK247540).
5: Calcium carbonate medium (1,000 ml of distilled water containing 30 g of CaCO 3, 20 g of glucose and 18 g of agar) was used for sporulation at 28C.
6: The preparation of the spore suspension and inoculation were performed as previously reported (Arnold et al.,  2003).
7: Briefly, the spores produced on the plate were washed with 0.5% sterilized gel solution (100 ml of distilled water containing 0.5 g of gel).
8: The mycelium was removed with sterile filter paper, and the spore suspension was diluted to 10 6 CFU/ml using a haemocytometer.
9: Then, the  A. adenophora leaves were misted to saturation on both the upper and lower surfaces using this spore suspension with a sterile sprayer, and the control group was sprayed with sterile 0.5% gel solution.
10: The whole plant was wrapped in a sterile black plastic bag for 48 hr to promote fungal infection, and the fungal infection was detected after 15 days, according to Arnold et al.
11: ( 2003).
12: The leaves inoculated and not inoculated (control plants) with  Colletotrichum sp.
13: (named Col+ and Col, respectively) were surface sterilized by submerging in 0.5% sodium hypochlorite for 2 min and 70% ethanol for 2 min and rinsing with sterile water 3 times, and then the surfacesterilized leaves were cut into fragments of approximately 6 mm 2.
14: Sixteen fragments were randomly selected from each leaf sample, placed on a malt extract agar (MEA, 1,000 ml of distilled water containing 30 g of malt extract, 3 g of soy peptone and 18 g of agar; pH 5.6  0.2) plate, sealed with parafilm and cultured at room temperature for several days (Figure  S2).
15: The number of leaf fragments with fungi and the colony morphology were observed and recorded.
16: The fungal infection rate of the leaves (Col+ and Col) was calculated by dividing the number of fragments with fungi by the total number of fragments.
