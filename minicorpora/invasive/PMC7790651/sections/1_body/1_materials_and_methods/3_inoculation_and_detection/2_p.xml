<p>The fungus JK99 was previously isolated from healthy leaves of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic>, making up nearly 30% of the total isolated fungi (Mei et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). It has been identified as 
 <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> sp. (see colony morphology in Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37072-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>. Its ITS gene was sequenced and was completely identical to the sequence of a strain of 
 <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> sp. A285 that we previously submitted to GenBank with an accession number of MK247540). Calcium carbonate medium (1,000 ml of distilled water containing 30 g of CaCO
 <sub>3</sub>, 20 g of glucose and 18 g of agar) was used for sporulation at 28°C. The preparation of the spore suspension and inoculation were performed as previously reported (Arnold et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>). Briefly, the spores produced on the plate were washed with 0.5% sterilized gel solution (100 ml of distilled water containing 0.5 g of gel). The mycelium was removed with sterile filter paper, and the spore suspension was diluted to 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/ml using a haemocytometer. Then, the 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> leaves were misted to saturation on both the upper and lower surfaces using this spore suspension with a sterile sprayer, and the control group was sprayed with sterile 0.5% gel solution. The whole plant was wrapped in a sterile black plastic bag for 48 hr to promote fungal infection, and the fungal infection was detected after 15 days, according to Arnold et al. (
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>). The leaves inoculated and not inoculated (control plants) with 
 <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> sp. (named Col+ and Col−, respectively) were surface sterilized by submerging in 0.5% sodium hypochlorite for 2 min and 70% ethanol for 2 min and rinsing with sterile water 3 times, and then the surface‐sterilized leaves were cut into fragments of approximately 6 mm
 <sup>2</sup>. Sixteen fragments were randomly selected from each leaf sample, placed on a malt extract agar (MEA, 1,000 ml of distilled water containing 30 g of malt extract, 3 g of soy peptone and 18 g of agar; pH 5.6 ± 0.2) plate, sealed with parafilm and cultured at room temperature for several days (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37072-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). The number of leaf fragments with fungi and the colony morphology were observed and recorded. The fungal infection rate of the leaves (Col+ and Col−) was calculated by dividing the number of fragments with fungi by the total number of fragments.
