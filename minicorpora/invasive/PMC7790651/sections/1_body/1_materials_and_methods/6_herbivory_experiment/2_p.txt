0: To date, no report has characterized the aboveground insect enemies of  A. adenophora, except that a native gallfly of Mexico,  Procecidochares utilis Stone, has been introduced to control  A. adenophora (Poudel et al.,  2019).
1: However, foliar herbivory is frequently observed in our routine investigations.
2: Thus, we performed herbivory experiments in the wild.
3: Briefly, Col+ and Col seedlings cultured in the laboratory (the FIR was significantly different, see Figure  3, FIR(Col) = 1.25%, FIR(Col+) = 10.83%) were placed at random and half a meter apart in a wild plant community in Xishan Forest Park, Kunming (245822 N, 1022749 E, 1980 m), Yunnan Province.
4: After a week in the field, the seedlings were brought back to the laboratory to record feeding by a guild of natural herbivores in the wild.
5: In most  A. adenophora individuals, only rare herbivory occurred on very few leaves during the period of our experiment; thus, we only evaluated signs of herbivory from insects attracted to  A. adenophora.
6: We used 1 to represent the occurrence of feeding when one individual of  A. adenophora was observed to show herbivory, regardless of the amount of herbivory damage, and 0 to represent that no feeding occurred.
7: The signs of herbivory were calculated and compared between Col+ and Col seedlings.
8: Each treatment contained 14 individuals, for a total of 28 seedlings.
