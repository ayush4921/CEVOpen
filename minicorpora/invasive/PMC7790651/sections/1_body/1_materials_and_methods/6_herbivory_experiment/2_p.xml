<p>To date, no report has characterized the aboveground insect enemies of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic>, except that a native gallfly of Mexico, 
 <italic>Procecidochares utilis</italic> Stone, has been introduced to control 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> (Poudel et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). However, foliar herbivory is frequently observed in our routine investigations. Thus, we performed herbivory experiments in the wild. Briefly, Col+ and Col− seedlings cultured in the laboratory (the FIR was significantly different, see Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37072-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, FIR(Col−) = 1.25%, FIR(Col+) = 10.83%) were placed at random and half a meter apart in a wild plant community in Xishan Forest Park, Kunming (24°58′22″ N, 102°27′49″ E, 1980 m), Yunnan Province. After a week in the field, the seedlings were brought back to the laboratory to record feeding by a guild of natural herbivores in the wild. In most 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> individuals, only rare herbivory occurred on very few leaves during the period of our experiment; thus, we only evaluated signs of herbivory from insects attracted to 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic>. We used “1” to represent the occurrence of feeding when one individual of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> was observed to show herbivory, regardless of the amount of herbivory damage, and “0” to represent that no feeding occurred. The signs of herbivory were calculated and compared between Col+ and Col− seedlings. Each treatment contained 14 individuals, for a total of 28 seedlings.
