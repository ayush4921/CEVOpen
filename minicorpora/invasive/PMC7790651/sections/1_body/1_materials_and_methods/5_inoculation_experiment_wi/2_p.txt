0: The pathogenic fungus used in this experiment was previously isolated from spots on  A. adenophora leaves, and a phylogenetic analysis of the ITS gene indicated that it was close to  Diaporthe helianthi (JK58) (see colony morphology in Figure  S4, with GenBank accession No.
1: JN854227 for the ITS gene).
2: Its pathogenicity (Figure  S5) was verified by the method previously described by Gilbert and Webb ( 2007).
3: Briefly, the pathogenic fungi cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA, 1,000 ml of distilled water containing 200 g of potato, 10 g of dextrose and 18 g of agar) medium were made into agar disks with a 3mm internal diameter punch.
4: A sterile needle was used to lightly wound the underside of the leaf.
5: The agar disk was then attached to the wound and secured with a hairpin.
6: The control group was inoculated with sterile agar disks.
7: The spot area was measured on day 7 after inoculation and then again every 7 days 4 consecutive times.
8: The inoculation experiments consisted of 4 treatments, called ColP (no  Colletotrichum, no pathogen), ColP+ (no  Colletotrichum, pathogen), Col+ P ( Colletotrichum, no pathogen) and Col+ P+ ( Colletotrichum, pathogen).
9: The first five pairs of mature leaves of the seedlings, representing five leaf ages, were inoculated with pathogens, and 9 replicates were inoculated for each leaf age for each treatment.
10: A total of 180 inoculations were carried out.
11: The FIR of  Colletotrichum sp.
12: was significantly different between Col+ and Col seedlings (Figure  2a, FIR(ColP+) = 3.33%, FIR(Col+ P+) = 28.33%, FIR(ColP) = 2.92%, FIR(Col+ P) = 16.30%), but there was no difference in FIR between leaf ages (L15) (Figure  2b, FIR(Col): L1 = 2.08%, L2 = 2.08%, L3 = 3.13%, L4 = 6.25%, L5 = 2.08%; FIR(Col+): L1 = 13.54%, L2 = 29.17%, L3 = 33.33%, L4 = 19.79%, L5 = 15.63%).
