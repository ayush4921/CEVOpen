0: Seeds were collected from wild populations of  A. adenophora in Kunming city (245822 N, 1022749 E, 1980 m), Yunnan Province, Southwest China.
1: Completely filled seeds were selected and surface sterilized by submerging them in 95% ethanol for 30 s and 2% sodium hypochlorite for 20 min and rinsing them with sterile water three times.
2: After surface sterilization, the seeds were submerged in sterile water for 24 hr and then planted in pots containing sterile soils.
3: The soils used to grow the plants were sterilized three times at 24hr intervals by autoclaving (121C, 0.135 MPa, 2 hr).
4: Pots were disinfected by submerging them in 0.2 g/L potassium permanganate solution for 30 min.
5: Plants were cultivated in an RXZ380D growth chamber (Ningbo Southeast Instrument Co., Ltd, Ningbo, China) with a temperature of 25  1C, light intensity of 80100 molm 2 s 1, 12hr photoperiod and humidity of 80  5%.
6: The germinated seedlings were supplemented with the same amount of sterile water in each pot every day as needed and watered with Hoagland nutrient solution (detailed in Table  1) once a month.
7: The seedlings were grown for 5 months, and then those of similar sizes (approximately 20 cm shoot length) were randomly selected for the subsequent experiments.
