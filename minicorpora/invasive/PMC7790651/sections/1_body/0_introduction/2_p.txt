0: The rapid expansion of exotic plants has caused serious damage to the structure and function of invaded ecosystems and has resulted in enormous social and economic losses (Richardson & Ricciardi,  2013; Vila et al.,  2010).
1: Determining why invasive plants succeed in their introduced range has been a major goal of invasion ecology.
2: Plantfungal associations are frequently key drivers of plant invasion success; a fungal species can act as a mutualist by enhancing plant defense, growth and stress tolerance or as a pathogen to cause establishment failure (Dickie et al.,  2017; Flory & Clay,  2013).
3: Foliar fungi are diverse in terrestrial ecosystems, including endophytes and epiphytes, and are often assumed to be mutualists, latent saprotrophs or pathogens of plants (Arnold,  2007; Osono et al.,  2004; Schulz et al.,  1999).
4: Foliar fungi have also been observed to be capable of altering plant disease severity (Arnold et al.,  2003; Busby et al.,  2016).
5: For exotic plants, foliar fungi can assist the host to grow, resist disease, and change herbivory.
6: For example, Aschehoug et al.
7: ( 2012) indicated that the inoculation of endophytic  Alternaria (CID120) on the invasive forb  Centaurea stoebe could directly increase its growth.
8: Currie et al.
9: ( 2019) demonstrated that foliar fungi ( Colletotrichum acutatum,  Alternaria alternata and  Cladosporium oxysporum) appeared to mitigate the effect of the pathogen  Puccinia komarovii on the invasive weed  Impatiens glandulifera.
10: Rudgers and Clay ( 2008) showed that the foliar fungus  Neotyphodium coenophialum could significantly reduce the abundance and diversity of herbivorous arthropods on the invasive plant  Lolium arundinaceum.
