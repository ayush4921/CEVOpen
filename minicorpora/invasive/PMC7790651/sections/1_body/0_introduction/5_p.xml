<p>The invasive plant 
 <italic>Ageratina adenophora</italic> (Sprengel) R. M. King and H. Robinson is a perennial herb of the Compositae family that is native to Central America. The spread of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> is considered to be a severe problem in more than 30 countries in Asia, Africa, Oceania, Europe and North America (Datta et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). In China, this weed has been reported to reduce the diversity of native plant species, crop production in agricultural land and forage production in pastures; moreover, this weed is poisonous to domestic animals (Poudel et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of successful weed invasion is ecologically and economically important. Previous results have indicated that the roles of soil biota in the establishment of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> are habitat dependent, for example, Niu et al. (
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>) indicated that soil biota collected from mixed evergreen‐broadleaf‐deciduous forests had strong inhibitory effects on 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> growth; however, Xiao et al. (
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) indicated that sterilization had no significant effect on 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> biomass growing in soils collected from a tropical botanical garden. Nevertheless, once established, 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> can change the soil biota to promote its own growth (Niu et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>), for example, by increasing the abundance of nitrogen‐fixing bacteria (Xu et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0053" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>) and root endophytic 
 <italic>Enterobacter</italic> bacteria (Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Moreover, 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> has also been reported to host various foliar fungi, including pathogens (Poudel et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>; Zhou et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0056" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>) and endophytes (Mei et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>, Fang et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). In addition, foliar herbivory was frequently observed in our routine investigations. These data suggest the occurrence of potential aboveground and belowground biotic interactions with 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic>, which remain to be characterized. In this study, we designed three independent experiments to determine the effect of a foliar fungus, 
 <italic>Colletotrichum,</italic> on the growth performance of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> in different soil conditions, as well as the functional responses of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> to aboveground pathogenic fungi and herbivores.
