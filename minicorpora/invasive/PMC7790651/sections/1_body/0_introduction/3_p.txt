0: In addition to aboveground biota, invasive plants also interact with belowground biota.
1: Escape from soilspecific host pathogens has been suggested to play a key role in determining the success of exotic plant invasion into local ecosystems, and this phenomenon is referred to as positive plantsoil feedback (PSF) (Callaway et al.,  2004; Hawkes et al.,  2005; Klironomos,  2002; Kulmatiski et al.,  2008).
2: Nonetheless, exotic plants have not experienced uniformly positive PSF, for example, Andonian et al.
3: ( 2011) indicated that an invasive weed experienced negative PSF; Crawford and Knight ( 2017) found that  Lespedeza cuneata experienced positive PSF in invaded soils only in the absence of competition; and for some plant species, a positive PSF was observed in a glasshouse but not in the field ((Schittko et al.,  2016).
4: These discrepancies suggest that the PSF experienced by the exotic invaders is context dependent and may involve the soil habitat type in which the plants grow (Pizano et al.,  2019).
