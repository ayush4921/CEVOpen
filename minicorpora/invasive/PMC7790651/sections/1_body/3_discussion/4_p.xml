<p>Interestingly, inoculation with the foliar fungus 
 <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> sp. changed the growth response of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> in different soil types, for example, it decreased the aboveground biomass of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> in nonsterilized forest soils but had no effect on 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> growth in agricultural soils, whether sterilized or nonsterilized (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37072-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). Moreover, this foliar fungus mainly affected aboveground rather than belowground growth, in particular by decreasing the LDB per unit area of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> in both sterilized and nonsterilized forest and agricultural soils (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37072-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Similarly, Newcombe et al. (
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>) demonstrated that the foliar fungus 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> (CID107) inhibited the development of 
 <italic>C. stoebe</italic> leaves and led to a decrease in aboveground biomass. Our data indicate that a given foliar fungus can have a complex interaction with hosts and impact different biological traits of hosts depending on the soils of the habitat and the presence of soil biota.
