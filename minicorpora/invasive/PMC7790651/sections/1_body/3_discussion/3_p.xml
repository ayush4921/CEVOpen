<p>Regarding the soil biota effects, we found that sterilization caused declines in most measures of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> growth in forest soil, including LDB per unit area, ADB and SL, and conversely, improved the LDB per unit area in agricultural soil (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37072-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). These findings suggested that 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> experienced positive soil biota effects in forest soil but negative or neutral effects in agricultural soil, supporting previous results that soil biota from different habitats have distinct inhibitory effects on 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> growth (Niu et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>; Xiao et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). The negative feedback in agricultural soil indicates that heavy loads of pathogens exist in these soils (Ashizawa et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Etebu &amp; Osborn, 
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Kohn, 
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">1995</xref>). In contrast, the positive effect of forest soils on 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> growth may be related to the high abundance and/or diversity of beneficial microbes, for example, AM fungi, in intact forest soils (Bordoloi et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). The invasiveness of a given plant and the invasibility of the ecosystem together determine the successful colonization of exotic plants in non‐native habitats (Milbau &amp; Nijs, 
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). Therefore, the positive feedback in forest soil does not indicate that 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> invades this habitat more easily than agricultural soils, which may contain unknown nutrients that support 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> growth better than forest soils. Great variation can be observed even among agricultural soils (Franklin &amp; Mills, 
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>) based on many factors, and the same is true for forest soils (Yang et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37072-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Therefore, a variety of factors need be ruled out before multiple soil types in both groups can be used in experiments. Nonetheless, the combined effects of both soil biota and nutrient limitation must be considered in evaluations of the invasiveness of species and the invasibility of ecosystems.
