 <caption> Disease development caused by the pathogen D. helianthin (a–c) and physical puncture (d–f) on leaves of A. adenophora with and without Colletotrichum sp. (a, d), on leaves of different ages (b, e) and at different times after pathogen inoculation or physical puncture (c, f). Col+ and Col− represent leaves with and without inoculation with Colletotrichum sp. P+ represents inoculation with pathogenic fungi, and P− represents physical puncture. L1‐5 represent different leaf ages (b). T1‐4 represent different durations of pathogen infection or physical puncture, with a continuous interval of 1 week (c). Nonparametric Mann–Whitney U tests were used to identify the difference in leaf spot area between leaves with and without the foliar fungus Colletotrichum sp. (Col− versus Col+; * represents p &lt; 0.05) (a, d). The * in panel (b, e, f) indicates a significant difference in disease development between Col− and Col+ on the different leaf ages and different durations ( * represents p &lt; 0.05; ** represents p &lt; 0.01). Linear regression was used to analyze the relationship between the leaf spot area and leaf age (b, e), as well as with the time after physical puncturing (c, f). The error bar represent the standard error </caption>
