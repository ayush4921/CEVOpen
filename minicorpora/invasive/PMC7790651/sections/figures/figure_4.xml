  <p>Effects of the foliar fungus 
   <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> sp. on the growth of 
   <italic>A. adenophora</italic> in different soil conditions. Col+ and Col− represent seedlings with and without 
   <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> sp., respectively; AS and FS represent agricultural and forest soil, respectively; S and NS represent sterilization and nonsterilization, respectively. Nonparametric analysis was used to compare the differences in growth performance between Col+ and Col− seedlings, sterilized and nonsterilized soils and agricultural and forest soils (n.s. represents 
   <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.10, + represents 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.10, * represents 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, ** represents 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). The error bar represents the standard error. Since one Col+ seedling died in the S‐FS treatment, statistical analysis between the Col+ and Col− seedlings was not performed for the biomass measurements (b, c)
