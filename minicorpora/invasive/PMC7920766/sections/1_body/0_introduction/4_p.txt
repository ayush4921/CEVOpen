0: Pest insects have a negative impact on Canada's forests and are second only to wildfires in their effect ("The State of Canada's Forests.

3: Pest insects that are IAS are considered a byproduct of anthropogenic activities and can provoke significant economic and biodiversity losses (Westphal et al.,  2008).
4: For instance, IAS are capable of destroying about 400,000 ha of forest every year in Canada (Government of Canada,  2013).
5: Nonmanufactured wood packaging and loose wood dunnage are highrisk pathways for the introduction of IAS, particularly woodboring beetles (e.g., Cerambycidae and Buprestidae families), like the Asian longhorned beetle ( Anoplophora glabripennis) and the emerald ash borer beetle ( Agrilus planipennis) (CFIA,  2017).
6: Current pathwaybased biosurveillance programs led by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) includes placing traps at sites that are at a high risk for IAS, such as industrial zones receiving international commodities associated with nonmanufactured wood packaging and dunnage.
7: The trapped insects remain in the fluid of collection jars until specimens are decanted and referred to the CFIA Entomology laboratory for morphological identification.
8: As organisms interact with their environment, whether it be the fluid of a collection jar or a plant, they shed DNA into it (Adams et al.,  2019; Tab erlet et al.,  2018).
9: The eDNA extracted from the collection fluid can then be used to identify insects considered IAS, native pests, and accompanying microorganisms using molecular methods such as eDNA metabarcoding (Pawlowski et al.,  2020; Taberlet et al.,  2018).
