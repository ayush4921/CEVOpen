0: Traditionally, plant health trapping survey protocols for insect pest detection have used alcoholbased collection fluids (e.g., ethanol or propylene glycol) to preserve biological material for morphological identification (CFIA,  2017).
1: Recent protocols have replaced alcoholbased fluids with saturated salt solutions due to advantages over the previous chemistries including lower cost, less storage space requirements, low toxicity to humans, fewer regulatory constraints for laboratories and inspectors, nonflammability, and lower evaporation rate (Young et al.,  2020).
2: Salt solutions have also proven to be satisfactory for preserving morphological structures of captured specimens (Young et al.,  2020) and for the preservation of water samples for eDNA analysis (Williams et al.,  2016).
3: Therefore, the standardization and validation of a costeffective protocol for eDNA metabarcoding analysis using salt trap solutions are of crucial interest.
4: The current study focusses on the optimization and validation of a protocol for eDNA metabarcoding of organisms captured during regulatory plant health monitoring surveys in southern Ontario, Canada.
5: Special attention will be placed on the woodboring beetles as well as regulated pathogenic bacteria and fungi inadvertently collected in the traps.
