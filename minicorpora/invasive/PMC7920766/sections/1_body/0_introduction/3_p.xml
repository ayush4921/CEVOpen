<p>The mitochondrial DNA region coding for cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) enzyme has been recognized as the primary marker for metabarcoding in the animal kingdom (Hebert et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37139-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>). Similarly, the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and the 16S ribosomal RNA gene have been adopted as the fungal and bacterial markers, respectively (Klindworth et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37139-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Seifert, 
 <xref rid="ece37139-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). Multiple reference databases and workbenches for data collection and analysis are currently available for these markers as well as a growing number of sequence records (e.g., BOLD has 8,099,249 records for COI as of November 20, 2020; Nilsson et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37139-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>; Quast et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37139-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Ratnasingham &amp; Hebert, 
 <xref rid="ece37139-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ece37139-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>, and UNITE has 2,480,043 for ITS as of November 20, 2020). However, despite the plethora of protocols available for eDNA metabarcoding and the drop in the cost of HTS over the years, there is limited information available on cost‐effectiveness (Elbrecht &amp; Steinke, 
 <xref rid="ece37139-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>; Ji et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37139-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; de Kerdrel et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37139-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Biodiversity monitoring and biosurveillance programs would benefit from the inclusion of HTS protocols to accelerate the detection of species of concern and reduce costs associated with processing large numbers of individual specimens (Giovani et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37139-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>; Piper et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37139-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). On a broader scale, cost‐effectiveness is essential given that only a fraction of the global biodiversity (including IAS and other pest species) has been described to date, and several billions of dollars may be needed to complete this enormous endeavor (Carbayo &amp; Marques, 
 <xref rid="ece37139-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>).
