<p>Traditionally, plant health trapping survey protocols for insect pest detection have used alcohol‐based collection fluids (e.g., ethanol or propylene glycol) to preserve biological material for morphological identification (CFIA, 
 <xref rid="ece37139-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Recent protocols have replaced alcohol‐based fluids with saturated salt solutions due to advantages over the previous chemistries including lower cost, less storage space requirements, low toxicity to humans, fewer regulatory constraints for laboratories and inspectors, nonflammability, and lower evaporation rate (Young et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37139-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Salt solutions have also proven to be satisfactory for preserving morphological structures of captured specimens (Young et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37139-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>) and for the preservation of water samples for eDNA analysis (Williams et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37139-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Therefore, the standardization and validation of a cost‐effective protocol for eDNA metabarcoding analysis using salt trap solutions are of crucial interest. The current study focusses on the optimization and validation of a protocol for eDNA metabarcoding of organisms captured during regulatory plant health monitoring surveys in southern Ontario, Canada. Special attention will be placed on the wood‐boring beetles as well as regulated pathogenic bacteria and fungi inadvertently collected in the traps.
