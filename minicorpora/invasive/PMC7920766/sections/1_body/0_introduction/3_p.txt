0: The mitochondrial DNA region coding for cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) enzyme has been recognized as the primary marker for metabarcoding in the animal kingdom (Hebert et al.,  2003).
1: Similarly, the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and the 16S ribosomal RNA gene have been adopted as the fungal and bacterial markers, respectively (Klindworth et al.,  2013; Seifert,  2009).
2: Multiple reference databases and workbenches for data collection and analysis are currently available for these markers as well as a growing number of sequence records (e.g., BOLD has 8,099,249 records for COI as of November 20, 2020; Nilsson et al.,  2019; Quast et al.,  2013; Ratnasingham & Hebert,  2007,  2013, and UNITE has 2,480,043 for ITS as of November 20, 2020).
3: However, despite the plethora of protocols available for eDNA metabarcoding and the drop in the cost of HTS over the years, there is limited information available on costeffectiveness (Elbrecht & Steinke,  2019; Ji et al.,  2013; de Kerdrel et al.,  2020).
4: Biodiversity monitoring and biosurveillance programs would benefit from the inclusion of HTS protocols to accelerate the detection of species of concern and reduce costs associated with processing large numbers of individual specimens (Giovani et al.,  2020; Piper et al.,  2019).
5: On a broader scale, costeffectiveness is essential given that only a fraction of the global biodiversity (including IAS and other pest species) has been described to date, and several billions of dollars may be needed to complete this enormous endeavor (Carbayo & Marques,  2011).
