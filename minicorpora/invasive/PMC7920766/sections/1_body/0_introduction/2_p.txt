0: Metabarcoding has become an effective method for molecularbased biomonitoring programs and biosurveillance for invasive alien species (IAS; Makiola et al.,  2020).
1: This molecular technique involves highthroughput sequencing (HTS), which facilitates the identification of multiple species using environmental DNA (eDNA) extracted from complex ecological samples (Creer et al.,  2016; Taberlet et al.,  2012).
2: Incorporating HTS into biosurveillance programs is advantageous as it can provide results faster than conventional identification methods, thereby allowing for early detection of species of concern, including IAS (Ruppert et al.,  2019).
3: The ability to obtain results fast, the existence of curated DNA reference libraries (Nilsson et al.,  2019; Quast et al.,  2013; Ratnasingham & Hebert,  2007), and the continued drop in the cost of HTS platforms have contributed to metabarcoding's rise in popularity in environmental monitoring (Cristescu,  2014; de Kerdrel et al.,  2020).
4: Furthermore, as DNA reference libraries with associated morphological species identifications continue to grow, the time, effort, and resources that would otherwise be put toward morphological identification of specimens can be saved through the use of molecular identification methods.
5: This is significant since the number of taxonomists available to conduct species identifications is declining.
6: Reference libraries, therefore, provide a permanent repository of traditional taxonomic expertise that can be used with the appropriate molecular identification tools as needed (Cristescu,  2014).
