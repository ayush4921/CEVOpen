0: The amount of debris within the salt solutions varied greatly across samples and would sometimes cause clogging of membrane pores.
1: Therefore, most samples required multiple membranes to filter the entire volume, resulting in a total of 110 membranes for the 48 samples.
2: The membranes were stored at 80C until DNA extraction could be completed.
3: As a negative control, one sample of saturated table salt solution prepared in the laboratory was also filtered.
4: All membranes were stored in new Ziploc bags at 80C until processing for eDNA extraction.
