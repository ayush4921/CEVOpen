<p>The amount of debris within the salt solutions varied greatly across samples and would sometimes cause clogging of membrane pores. Therefore, most samples required multiple membranes to filter the entire volume, resulting in a total of 110 membranes for the 48 samples. The membranes were stored at −80°C until DNA extraction could be completed. As a negative control, one sample of saturated table salt solution prepared in the laboratory was also filtered. All membranes were stored in new Ziploc bags at −80°C until processing for eDNA extraction.</p>
