<p>Lindgren funnel traps were equipped with Ultra High Release Ethanol (UHR) Lures (Synergy Semiochemical Corp), a type of lure that targets all longhorn beetles, and a collection cup that contained approximately 100 ml of a table salt‐saturated solution (2 kg of sodium chloride per 5 L of water). Traps were placed at sampling sites during the summer following CFIA's Survey Protocol: Invasive Alien Species Forestry Trapping (
 <xref rid="ece37139-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). The first set of traps was collected in July 2018 and the second in August 2018, approximately 4 weeks after having been placed. With four locations, six sample sites, and two collection periods, a total of 48 field samples were collected for the study. All specimens captured in the traps were decanted from the solution and sent to the CFIA's entomology Laboratory. Salt trap solutions were transported to the Hanner Laboratory at the University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada, for temporary storage at −80℃ followed by processing and analysis.
