0: Lindgren funnel traps were equipped with Ultra High Release Ethanol (UHR) Lures (Synergy Semiochemical Corp), a type of lure that targets all longhorn beetles, and a collection cup that contained approximately 100 ml of a table saltsaturated solution (2 kg of sodium chloride per 5 L of water).
1: Traps were placed at sampling sites during the summer following CFIA's Survey Protocol: Invasive Alien Species Forestry Trapping ( 2017).
2: The first set of traps was collected in July 2018 and the second in August 2018, approximately 4 weeks after having been placed.
3: With four locations, six sample sites, and two collection periods, a total of 48 field samples were collected for the study.
4: All specimens captured in the traps were decanted from the solution and sent to the CFIA's entomology Laboratory.
5: Salt trap solutions were transported to the Hanner Laboratory at the University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada, for temporary storage at 80C followed by processing and analysis.
