<p>Similar to 16S, data analysis of ITS was carried out in Geneious Prime, version 2020.1.1 (Biomatters, Ltd.) as follows: (a) Paired reads were set; (b) sequences were trimmed with BBDuk version 37.25, keeping a minimum sequence quality of 20 Phred (i.e., 99% base call accuracy), and a minimum length of 200 bp; (c) paired‐end reads were merged with BBMerge version 37.25; (d) duplicates were removed with Dedupe version 37.25; (e) chimera reads were removed using UNITE as a reference library; (f) clustering was done by de novo assembly using Geneious assembler and custom sensitivity, as well as minimum overlap identity of 98%; and (g) The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) was used to compare our sequence library against the Internal Transcribed Spacer database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Search results were ordered by E‐value (in ascending order) and then filtered by sequence length (≥200 bp) and percentage of pairwise identity (≥98%). The filtered list was queried against the list of fungal species regulated by Canada. Graphs of fungal diversity were generated for the most species‐rich genera (≥10 species) using R (R Core Team,
