<p>HTS data visualization, validation, analysis, and storage were conducted in the multiuser platform Multiplex Barcode Research And Visualization Environment (mBRAVE; 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbrave.net/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://mbrave.net/</ext-link>). The parameters in the online platform were set as follow: (a) trimming: trim front: 30 bp; trim end: 30 bp; trim length 450 bp; (b) filtering: min QV: 20 qv; min length: 350 bp; max bases with low QV [˂20]: 25%; max bases with ultralow QV [˂10]: 5%; (c) preclustering threshold: none; ID distance threshold: 3%; minimum OTU size: 5; operational taxonomic unit (OTU) threshold: 2%; (d) assembler min overlap: 20 bp, assembler max subs: 5 bp. An mBRAVE algorithm for removing chimeras was also applied to the data; (e) queries against Barcode of Life (BOLD) libraries in the following order: 1.—SYS‐MBRAVEC: System Reference Library—Standard Contaminants Based on Reagent Production; 2.—SYS‐HUMC: System Reference Library—Human Contamination Check; 3.—SYS‐CRLBACTERIA: System Reference Library for mBRAVE ID Engine—Bacteria COI; 4.—SYS‐CRLPROTISTA: System Reference Library for mBRAVE ID Engine—Protista COI; 5.—SYS‐CRLCHORDATA: System Reference Library for mBRAVE ID Engine—Chordata; 6.—SYS‐CRLAVES: System Reference Library for mBRAVE ID Engine—Aves; 7.—DS‐PLANTP20: CFIA‐Plant pests‐invasive species (insects) update February 2020; 8.—DS‐VBEETLES: Vectors of

 <italic>Culicoides</italic> Database Update: February 2020; 10.—SYS‐CRLINSECTA: System Reference Library for mBRAVE ID Engine—Insecta; 11.—SYS‐CRLNONINSECTARTH: System Reference Library for mBRAVE ID Engine—Non‐Insect Arthropoda; and 12.—SYS‐CRLNONARTHINVERT: System Reference Library for mBRAVE ID Engine—Non‐Arthropoda Invertebrates. Sequences were matched to BINs in mBRAVE. Essentially, a BIN (Barcode Index Number) is an alphanumeric code that corresponds to a tight cluster of closely related species haplotypes. BINs are a good proxy for actual biological species (Ratnasingham &amp; Hebert,
