<p>A second pipeline for data analysis was conducted to validate the identity of the IAS recognized by mBRAVE. COI FASTQ raw data files were analyzed sequentially in Geneious Prime, version 2020.1.1 (Biomatters, Ltd.) as follows: (a) Paired reads were set; (b) sequences were trimmed with BBDuk version 37.25, keeping a minimum sequence quality of 20 Phred (i.e., 99% base call accuracy), and a minimum length of 200 bp; (c) paired‐end reads were merged with BBMerge version 37.25; (d) duplicates were removed with Dedupe version 37.25; (e) clustering was completed by de novo assembly using Geneious assembler, as well as minimum overlap identity of 98%; and (f) The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) was used to compare our sequence library against the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. Rarefaction curves expressed as the number of operational taxonomic units (OTU) identified per trap versus the number of sequences related to the OTUs identified were built in R version 3.6.1 (R Core Team,
