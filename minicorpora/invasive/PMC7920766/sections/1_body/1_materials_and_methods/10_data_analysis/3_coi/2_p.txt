0: HTS data visualization, validation, analysis, and storage were conducted in the multiuser platform Multiplex Barcode Research And Visualization Environment (mBRAVE;  http://mbrave.net/).
1: The parameters in the online platform were set as follow: (a) trimming: trim front: 30 bp; trim end: 30 bp; trim length 450 bp; (b) filtering: min QV: 20 qv; min length: 350 bp; max bases with low QV [20]: 25%; max bases with ultralow QV [10]: 5%; (c) preclustering threshold: none; ID distance threshold: 3%; minimum OTU size: 5; operational taxonomic unit (OTU) threshold: 2%; (d) assembler min overlap: 20 bp, assembler max subs: 5 bp.
2: An mBRAVE algorithm for removing chimeras was also applied to the data; (e) queries against Barcode of Life (BOLD) libraries in the following order: 1.SYSMBRAVEC: System Reference LibraryStandard Contaminants Based on Reagent Production; 2.SYSHUMC: System Reference LibraryHuman Contamination Check; 3.SYSCRLBACTERIA: System Reference Library for mBRAVE ID EngineBacteria COI; 4.SYSCRLPROTISTA: System Reference Library for mBRAVE ID EngineProtista COI; 5.SYSCRLCHORDATA: System Reference Library for mBRAVE ID EngineChordata; 6.SYSCRLAVES: System Reference Library for mBRAVE ID EngineAves; 7.DSPLANTP20: CFIAPlant pestsinvasive species (insects) update February 2020; 8.DSVBEETLES: Vectors of  Bretziella fagacearum update February 2020; 9.DSCUL2020:  Culicoides Database Update: February 2020; 10.SYSCRLINSECTA: System Reference Library for mBRAVE ID EngineInsecta; 11.SYSCRLNONINSECTARTH: System Reference Library for mBRAVE ID EngineNonInsect Arthropoda; and 12.SYSCRLNONARTHINVERT: System Reference Library for mBRAVE ID EngineNonArthropoda Invertebrates.
3: Sequences were matched to BINs in mBRAVE.
4: Essentially, a BIN (Barcode Index Number) is an alphanumeric code that corresponds to a tight cluster of closely related species haplotypes.
5: BINs are a good proxy for actual biological species (Ratnasingham & Hebert,  2013).
