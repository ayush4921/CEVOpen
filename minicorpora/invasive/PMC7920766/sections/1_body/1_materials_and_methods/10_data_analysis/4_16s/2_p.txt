0: 16S molecular marker data were analyzed sequentially using Geneious Prime, version 2020.1.1 (Biomatters, Ltd.) as follows: (a) Paired reads were set; (b) sequences were trimmed with BBDuk version 37.25, keeping a minimum sequence quality of 20 Phred (i.e., 99% base call accuracy), and a minimum length of 200 bp; (c) pairedend reads were merged with BBMerge version 37.25; (d) duplicate sequences were removed with Dedupe version 37.25; and (e) exact sequence variants were classified using the 16S Biodiversity tool implemented in Geneious Prime, version 2020.1.1 (Biomatters, Ltd.).
1: This tool runs the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) Classifier, version 2.12, which assigns a taxonomy to the genus level (Wang et al.,  2007) and includes a bootstrap confidence estimate for each sequence by comparing them to a bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA database (Wang et al.,  2007).
2: Search results were queried against the list of bacterial species regulated by Canada.
3: Graphs of bacterial diversity were produced using the Krona metagenomic visualization tool (Ondov et al.,  2011).
