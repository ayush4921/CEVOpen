0: Lindgren funnel traps were placed at four locations in Southern Ontario, Canada, with six sample sites (traps) at each location (Figure  1).
1: The traps represented a subset of those deployed following the CFIA's annual regulatory survey program (CFIA's Plant Health business line), which is aimed at detecting insects introduced through highrisk pathways.
2: Locations were selected based on susceptibility to IAS, accessibility, sufficient area to accommodate six traps spaced approximately 2530 meters apart, and limited public access to avoid vandalism.
3: Six traps were then distributed at these sites near species of trees known to be hosts to the target IAS and that were showing evidence of stress/decline, or damage, indicating the possible presence of IAS.
4: One location was in Halton Hills (GT) and had traps situated near a Municipal landfill and railroad track.
5: A second location was in a 241hectare park of Carolinian forest that is situated along Lake Erie in ChathamKent (WP).
6: A third location, Barrie (BA), was within a wooded area close to railway tracks that experiences a high volume of import traffic.
7: A fourth and final location was in Woodstock (TO), a city that includes manufacturing facilities that import commodities packaged using wood materials.
8: All four locations are less than 215 km from the USCanada border and could presumably be exposed to traffic of imported wood materials carrying IAS and other pests.
