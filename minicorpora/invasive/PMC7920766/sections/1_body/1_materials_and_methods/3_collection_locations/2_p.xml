<p>Lindgren funnel traps were placed at four locations in Southern Ontario, Canada, with six sample sites (traps) at each location (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37139-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The traps represented a subset of those deployed following the CFIA's annual regulatory survey program (CFIA's Plant Health business line), which is aimed at detecting insects introduced through high‐risk pathways. Locations were selected based on susceptibility to IAS, accessibility, sufficient area to accommodate six traps spaced approximately 25–30 meters apart, and limited public access to avoid vandalism. Six traps were then distributed at these sites near species of trees known to be hosts to the target IAS and that were showing evidence of stress/decline, or damage, indicating the possible presence of IAS. One location was in Halton Hills (GT) and had traps situated near a Municipal landfill and railroad track. A second location was in a 241‐hectare park of Carolinian forest that is situated along Lake Erie in Chatham‐Kent (WP). A third location, Barrie (BA), was within a wooded area close to railway tracks that experiences a high volume of import traffic. A fourth and final location was in Woodstock (TO), a city that includes manufacturing facilities that import commodities packaged using wood materials. All four locations are less than 215 km from the US–Canada border and could presumably be exposed to traffic of imported wood materials carrying IAS and other pests.
