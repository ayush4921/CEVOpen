0: Sequencing of COI, 16S, and ITS marker regions was performed at the Genomics Facility of AAC at the University of Guelph.
1: For quality control purposes, each sequence library was first normalized using SequalPrep Normalization Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), pooled, and quantified with the Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and finally checked for fragment size in a Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA Chip (Agilent).
2: After passing quality control, libraries were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq System using a MiSeq reagent kit, version 3 (600 cycles).
3: Each sample was analyzed based on retaining 1% of the total capacity of the run.
4: Sequencing reads were demultiplexed, and the adapters trimmed with the MiSeq Reporter software generating two pairedend FASTQ raw data files.
