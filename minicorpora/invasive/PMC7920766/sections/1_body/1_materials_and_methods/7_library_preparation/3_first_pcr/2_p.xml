<p>The first PCR was conducted in 25 μl reaction volumes on an Eppendorf Mastercycler thermal cycler with each reaction containing 2.5 μl of eDNA template, 12.5 μl of 2X KAPA HiFi HotStart Ready Mix (Roche Diagnostics), and 0.2 μM of primers with Illumina adaptors (Table 
 <xref rid="ece37139-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The eDNA target fragment lengths to amplify were ~407 base pairs (bp) for COI, 460 bp for 16S, and 500–600 bp for ITS. Cycling conditions were as follows: COI: 94°C (120 s) followed by five cycles at 94°C (40 s), 45°C (40 s), 72°C (60 s); then 35 cycles of 94°C (40 s), 51°C (40 s), 72°C (60 s); and a final extension of 72°C (5 min) (Braukmann et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37139-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>); 16S: 95°C (180 s), 25 cycles of 95°C (30 s), 55°C (30 s), 72°C (30 s), and a final extension of 72°C (300 s) (“16S Metagenomic Sequencing Library Preparation”, 
 <xref rid="ece37139-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>); ITS: 95°C (120 s), 40 cycles at 95°C (30 s), 55°C (30 s), 72°C (60 s), and a final extension of 72°C (600 s) (Beeck et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37139-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). A negative control was included for every batch of samples amplified. All PCR products were visualized on 1% agarose gel to check for proper amplification and fragment size of the amplicons. PCR products were purified using a 0.8x NGS magnetic beads (Macherey‐Nagel) ratio following the manufacturer's protocols.
