0: The first PCR was conducted in 25 l reaction volumes on an Eppendorf Mastercycler thermal cycler with each reaction containing 2.5 l of eDNA template, 12.5 l of 2X KAPA HiFi HotStart Ready Mix (Roche Diagnostics), and 0.2 M of primers with Illumina adaptors (Table  1).
1: The eDNA target fragment lengths to amplify were ~407 base pairs (bp) for COI, 460 bp for 16S, and 500600 bp for ITS.
2: Cycling conditions were as follows: COI: 94C (120 s) followed by five cycles at 94C (40 s), 45C (40 s), 72C (60 s); then 35 cycles of 94C (40 s), 51C (40 s), 72C (60 s); and a final extension of 72C (5 min) (Braukmann et al.,  2019); 16S: 95C (180 s), 25 cycles of 95C (30 s), 55C (30 s), 72C (30 s), and a final extension of 72C (300 s) (16S Metagenomic Sequencing Library Preparation,  2013); ITS: 95C (120 s), 40 cycles at 95C (30 s), 55C (30 s), 72C (60 s), and a final extension of 72C (600 s) (Beeck et al.,  2014).
3: A negative control was included for every batch of samples amplified.
4: All PCR products were visualized on 1% agarose gel to check for proper amplification and fragment size of the amplicons.
5: PCR products were purified using a 0.8x NGS magnetic beads (MachereyNagel) ratio following the manufacturer's protocols.
