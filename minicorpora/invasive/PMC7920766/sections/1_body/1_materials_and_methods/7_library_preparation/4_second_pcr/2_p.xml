<p>The purified products resulting from the first PCR were used as the template for the second PCR. As per standard methods for eDNA library preparation, the second PCR was conducted in a separate room and using different PCR workstations than the first PCR. The second PCR used unique index primer combinations for each sample. The sequences for the index primers were equivalent to the Nextera XT Index Kit (Illumina), but synthesized de novo using the services from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) and prepared at Advanced Analysis Centre (AAC) at the University of Guelph. This PCR was conducted in 50 μl reaction volumes on an Eppendorf Mastercycler using a unique index primer combination for each sample. Each reaction contained 5 μl of previously cleaned PCR product, 5 μl of each index primer (10 μM), 25 μl of 2X KAPA HiFi HotStart Ready Mix (Roche Diagnostics), and 10 μl of molecular biology grade water. Cycling conditions were as follows: 95°C (180 s), eight cycles at 95°C (30 s), 55°C (40 s), 72°C (30 s), and a final extension at 72°C (300 s) (“16S Metagenomic Sequencing Library Preparation”,
