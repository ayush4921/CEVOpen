0: The eDNA extraction steps described below were performed on the 110 membranes and the negative control.
1: To extract the eDNA, we used the Dougherty et al.
2: ( 2016) protocol with some minor modifications.
3: Each filter paper was allowed to thaw and then cut into quarters using new razor blades.
4: Each quarter was placed into individual 2ml microcentrifuge tubes containing ~250 mg of 1mmdiameter glass beads, and 500 l of CTAB buffer prewarmed to 65C in a heat block.
5: The filter paper quarters were pulped using the TissueLyser II (Qiagen) at a frequency of 30 Hz for one minute and then incubated at 65C for one hour in a heat block.
6: Following incubation, each tube received 500 l of 24:1 chloroformisoamyl alcohol and was briefly vortexed.
7: The aqueous phase containing the eDNA was separated from the chloroform phase by centrifuging the tubes at 13,000  g for 15 min to enable phase separation.
8: After two passes with 24:1 chloroformisoamyl alcohol, the aqueous phase (approximately 500 l) was transferred to new 2.0ml Eppendorf tubes and mixed with 500 l of isopropanol, and 200 l of a 5 M NaCl solution.
9: Tubes were briefly vortex and stored at 20C overnight to facilitate precipitation of eDNA.
10: Tubes were then centrifugated at 13,000  g for another 15 min to pellet the eDNA.
11: The supernatant was removed by pipetting, and 200 l of 70% ethanol was added to wash the pellet.
12: After centrifugation at 13,000  g for 15 min, the ethanol was removed by pipetting and replaced anew.
13: The contents were again briefly vortexed and centrifuged at 13,000  g for 15 min.
14: The ethanol was removed for a final time, and the tubes were then placed in a fume hood to allow any remaining ethanol to evaporate at room temperature (~1 hr).
15: Once the eDNA pellet was dry, it was then resuspended in 25 l 1X TE buffer (prewarmed at 70C) to favor DNA dilution.
16: eDNA extracts from each quarter belonging to the same trap were pooled.
17: A 5 l subsample was used to visually assess the presence and quality of eDNA on a 1% agarose gel electrophoresis.
18: The concentration of eDNA (ng/l) was determined by fluorometry (Qubit).
19: All eDNA extracts with concentrations over 5 ng/l were diluted to 5 ng/l with 10 mM Tris pH = 8.5 This was done to normalize the amount of starting material per sample and to reduce the effect of potential PCR inhibitors in the samples.
20: Eight samples exhibited signals of inhibition by showing no amplification during the first PCR of library preparation (see below).
21: These samples were treated to remove inhibitors using a 1x NGS magnetic beads (MachereyNagel) ratio, following manufacturer's protocols.
22: Following quality control steps, the remaining volume of solution containing eDNA extract was placed in 1.5ml LoBind Eppendorf tubes and stored at 20C.
