0: We used a modified CTAB buffer (Coyne et al.,  2005; Dempster et al.,  1999) (2% w/v cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, 2% w/v polyvinylpyrrolidone, 1.4M NaCl, 100 mM TrisHCl, 20 nM EDTA).
1: This buffer was used due to reported success in retrieving good quality eDNA yield (Barnes et al.,  2014; Dougherty et al.,  2016; Renshaw et al.,  2015; Turner et al.,  2014).
