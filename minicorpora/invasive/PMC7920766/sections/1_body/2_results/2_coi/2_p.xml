<p>All samples amplified successfully with the primer combination chosen. Fragment sizes were at the expected length of approximately 407 nucleotides for all PCR steps during library preparation. The Illumina MiSeq run generated a total of 9,034,668 reads for the 48 traps analyzed in this study with the number of reads per sample ranging from 102,571 to 338,642 (Table 
 <xref rid="ece37139-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The percentage of filtered reads was lower than 25% for all the traps except for two (WP‐1‐18‐7‐18_COI, 60.43% and BA‐6_19‐7‐18_COI, 25.73%) (Table 
 <xref rid="ece37139-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The number of suspected species present through the identification of unique BINs per trap varied from 60 to 313. The lowest number of BINs was attributed to traps placed at the Barrie (BA) location (BA‐1_24‐8‐18_COI, BA‐3_24‐8‐18_COI, and BA‐6_24‐8‐18_COI collected on August 2018) (Table 
 <xref rid="ece37139-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The highest number of BINs was recovered in traps placed at the Woodstock (TO) location (TO‐1‐30‐07‐2018_COI, TO‐5‐30‐07‐2018_COI, and TO‐6‐30‐07‐2018_COI collected on July 2018). The number of remaining OTUs inferred from the data ranged from 36 to 469 (Table 
 <xref rid="ece37139-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Rarefaction curves of total OTU counts versus the number of sequences calculated for each trap reached asymptote in all cases (Figure
