<p>No regulated fungal species were identified across collection sites. A total of 36 genera consisting of ten or more species were detected across sampling locations (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37139-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Three out of the 36 genera (
 <italic>Alternaria, Diaporthe,</italic> and 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic>) which have species represented on Canadian regulatory lists were successfully detected with a high percentage of pairwise genetic identity (≥ 98%) in all location sites (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37139-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The number of fungal genera comprising regulated species per location ranged from three to six, with the traps placed in Barrie in August 2018 containing the lowest fungal diversity (Figure
