<p>Five (
 <italic>Brenneria</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, 
 <italic>Xanthomonas, Xylella</italic>, and 
 <italic>Xylophilus</italic>) out of the seven genera containing species regulated by Canada were identified across collection sites in Ontario and comprised 2,061,117 sequences (

Among the five genera, sequence count and mean confidence ranged from 47 to 103,730 and 27.09 and 93.08, respectively (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37139-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and 
 <italic>Xanthomonas</italic> exhibited the highest mean confidence values for sequence classification, while 
 <italic>Xylella</italic> showed the lowest value. 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> was also the most represented genus in terms of sequence count (Figure
