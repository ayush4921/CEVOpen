<p>Species‐specific sequence identification was completed with over 97% average mean similarity and over a minimum COI sequence length of 392 bp (Table 
 <xref rid="ece37139-tbl-0004" ref-type="table">4</xref>). DNA sequences of two invasive plant pest species regulated by the CFIA (
 <italic>Lymantria dispar</italic> [gypsy moth] and 
 <italic>A. planipennis</italic> [emerald ash borer beetle]) were detected at the sampling locations, which is not unexpected as the species are known to occur at these locations. DNA sequences of the gypsy moth were also recovered at every sampling location in both collection months. On the contrary, DNA sequences of the emerald ash borer beetle were recovered at only two sampling locations in July (Barrie [BA] and Woodstock [TO]), as well as in August (Halton Hills [GT] and Barrie [BA]) (Table 
 <xref rid="ece37139-tbl-0004" ref-type="table">4</xref>). The highest number of gypsy moth sequences was recovered in August at the Halton Hills location. For the emerald ash borer beetle, the highest number of DNA sequences was obtained at the Barrie location in July 2018.
