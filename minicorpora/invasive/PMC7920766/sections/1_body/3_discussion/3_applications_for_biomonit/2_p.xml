<p>Since its introduction into North America, the emerald ash borer beetle (order Coleoptera) has been responsible for killing several millions of ash trees across the continent (Herms &amp; McCullough,

Current management plans are mostly focused on biological and insecticidal control of infected areas and do not typically include early detection of the species as it moves into new areas. This approach mainly reflects difficulties in early detection via conventional surveys (Herms &amp; McCullough, 
 <xref rid="ece37139-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). In that respect, present eDNA metabarcoding protocols are promising and allow for not only early detection but also species identifications at any life stage. The containment of pest insect outbreaks is also greatly benefited from the development of nondestructive eDNA metabarcoding protocols that allow early detection. By delineating the boundaries of an outbreak as clearly as possible, actions can be taken on infected areas while avoiding the spread of the pest. The gypsy moth (order Lepidoptera) is listed among the 100 worst IAS by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and it is considered among the worst hardwood defoliators (Vivek et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37139-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Our sampling protocol was able to trap a regulated Lepidopteran species, even if the specific traps and lures targeted mainly Coleopterans, particularly wood‐boring beetles. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the protocol in detecting IAS and its potential wider applicability beyond our target taxa.
