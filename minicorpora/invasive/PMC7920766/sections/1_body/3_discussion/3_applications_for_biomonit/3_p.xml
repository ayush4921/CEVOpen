<p>Developing efficient and cost‐effective protocols for the early detection of IAS is key in decreasing tree deaths and related economic losses. In the recent past, the high cost of HTS platforms prohibited their application in routine biodiversity monitoring and biosurveillance programs (Shokralla et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37139-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). Although HTS has become more economically accessible, it constitutes just one element in multistep metabarcoding protocols. In our study, we used alternative cost‐effective chemistries without compromising protocol efficiency and were able to process samples at a reduced cost (Table 
 <xref rid="ece37139-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). This cost‐effectiveness if applied to similar programs, could open opportunities for increased replication and thus more accurate species diversity delineations. Although technical replicates were not included in our experimental design, these could be incorporated in the future to evaluate the variability of the testing protocol. Nevertheless, the multiple traps per location could be considered biological replicates when it comes to the evaluation of the presence/absence of IAS in a given location.
