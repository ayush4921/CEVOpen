<p>It is worth mentioning that morphological identification of arthropods remains a challenge due to factors such as unidentifiable early life stages, specimens escaping from the trap, and advanced or total degradation of specimens in collection jars. In all these cases, the eDNA metabarcoding protocol described here would allow the detection of the species, whereas morphological confirmation may not be possible, leading to false negatives. However, the eDNA of an invasive species that has not been captured can be released with a specimen’s feces and result in potential false‐positive results for a particular location while at the same time signalling the presence of the IAS in the wider region. The eDNA from a non‐captured species can also be found when the invasive species’ material persists in the trapped species’ gut content. These scenarios illustrate how eDNA and morphological identification might yield different species' detection results.</p>
