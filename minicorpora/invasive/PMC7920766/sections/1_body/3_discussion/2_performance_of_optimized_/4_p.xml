<p>Contrary to eDNA metabarcoding of samples collected in ethanol (Zenker et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37139-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>), our protocol was successful in generating high‐quality library preparations of the three targeted molecular markers for all of our samples. This validates that salt‐saturated solutions can act as a reservoir for eDNA in conventional trapping surveys (Young et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37139-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). If this were not the case, any logistical advantages over the alcohol‐based fluids listed above would more likely be irrelevant. However, additional studies, specifically addressing eDNA preservation in saturated salt solutions versus alcohol‐based solutions, will be required in samples of known taxonomic composition to compare the methods' efficiency comprehensively.
