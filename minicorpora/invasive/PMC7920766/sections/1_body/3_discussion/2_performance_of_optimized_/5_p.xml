<p>Our procedure was effective in detecting IAS from high‐risk sites in southern Ontario. Among the 2,535 BINs identified, two regulated insect species known to be established in the area, 
 <italic>A. planipennis</italic> (order Coleoptera) and 
 <italic>L. dispar</italic> (order Lepidoptera), were identified and also validated by a more than 97% mean similarity over a minimum of 392 bp (Table 
 <xref rid="ece37139-tbl-0004" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Species were identified using two independent data analysis pipelines to significantly reduce the likelihood of false positives.
