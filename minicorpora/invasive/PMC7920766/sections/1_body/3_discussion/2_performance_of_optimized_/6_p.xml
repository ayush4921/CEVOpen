<p>Despite the lack of detection of regulated bacterial and fungal species, there were five bacterial (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37139-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) and three fungal genera (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece37139-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) comprising regulated species that were successfully recovered across all sampling sites. These results validate our modified protocol for detecting regulated bacterial and fungal taxa based on 16S and ITS and reinforce its utility for the identification of a wide variety of regulated taxa. However, whether or not some taxa are underrepresented in salt trap‐saturated solutions, as has been demonstrated for alcohol‐based collection fluids (Zenker et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37139-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>), should be further evaluated.
