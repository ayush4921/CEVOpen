<p>eDNA metabarcoding allows rapid species identification from complex environmental samples, with higher sensitivity, lower environmental disturbance, and shorter processing times than traditional identification methods (Ruppert et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37139-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). These attributes make the integration of eDNA methods into biosurveillance programs for the detecting IAS an ideal choice. The optimized protocol presented here, using a saturated salt trap solution successfully detected IAS and allowed sample processing from eDNA extraction to HTS at a fraction of the cost compared with the Illumina reference protocol (Table 
 <xref rid="ece37139-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Our results suggest the stability of the eDNA in the collection fluid as well as the preservation of arthropod specimens allowing for morphological species identification and validation. Due to the characteristics of our experimental design, such as eDNA potentially remaining in the salt solution for up to 4 weeks, there is an expected level of eDNA degradation. Despite possible degradation, the target fragment lengths (above 400 bp) were effectively amplified for all the molecular markers studied, regardless of the origin of the genetic material (i.e., animal, bacterial, or fungal).
