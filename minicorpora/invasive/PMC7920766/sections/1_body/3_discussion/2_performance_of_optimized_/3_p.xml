<p>Considering that every step of an adapted eDNA metabarcoding protocol can have a particular impact on species detectability, protocol validation is essential (Ruppert et al., 
 <xref rid="ece37139-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). The asymptotic rarefaction curves presented here may suggest that the read depths of our optimized protocol were sufficient to recover the full OTU diversity present in each trap. Nevertheless, it is important to highlight that the curves reflect OTU diversity based on the specific primer sets used in our study (Table 
 <xref rid="ece37139-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Although we selected primers to maximize OTU representation, due to issues such as “PCR dropout,” primer binding and therefore species detection may have been less than 100% (Griswold,
