<p>In an environmental setting, direct applications of the protocol at the national level could include contributing to pest and pathogen databases maintained by the CFIA, the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Canada, Ministry of Agriculture and Agri‐Food, and Ministry of Health. The protocol may also find utility with similar agencies internationally. Our protocol is not only relevant to CFIA's Plant Health business line but also to their Animal Health business line and to other stakeholders, such as industry, environmental consultants, researchers, and conservation managers. Further, our metabarcoding protocol has potential diagnostic applications in a human health clinical setting for bacterial‐ and fungal‐borne diseases. Importantly, the cost‐effectiveness of the optimized protocol could be useful in both environmental and human health settings where the costs of pathogen detection and identification can be prohibitive. The protocol could be used to investigate and describe pathogen interactions with each other and with their environment (i.e., the pathobiome). Altogether, the validated and cost‐effective protocol may be fundamental in characterizing interactions among humans, animals, plants, microorganisms, and their shared environment to achieve better health results for all (e.g., One Health approach).</p>
