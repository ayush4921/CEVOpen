<p>Here, we standardized, optimized, and validated a protocol for metabarcoding using eDNA collected from salt trap solutions. We demonstrate the validity of employing eDNA‐based detection of government‐regulated pests as a potential regulatory and management tool. Also, the current protocol supports the utility of salt‐saturated solutions as reservoirs of eDNA and as a valid substitute for alcohol‐based collection fluids in biosurveillance studies.</p>
