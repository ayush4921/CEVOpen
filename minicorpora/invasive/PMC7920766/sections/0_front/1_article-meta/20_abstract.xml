 <p>In the present study, we optimized and validated a fast and cost‐effective eDNA metabarcoding protocol for biosurveillance of plant IAS and characterization of insect and microorganism diversity. Forty‐eight traps were placed, following the CFIA's annual forest insect trapping survey, at four locations in southern Ontario that are high risk for forest IAS. We collected insects and eDNA samples using Lindgren funnel traps that contained a saturated salt (NaCl) solution in the collection jar. Our study results reaffirm the effectiveness and importance of integrating eDNA metabarcoding as part of identification protocols in biosurveillance programs.
