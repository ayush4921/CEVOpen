<p id="p0035">A third and much more neglected evolutionary process that also influences the distribution of genetic diversity is gene flow. In outcrossing species, gene flow requires both the dispersal of individuals (gametophytes or sporophytes) to a different populationÂ and successful mating with resident individuals. Levels of gene flow can be affected by geographic distance, as well as by features of the landscape. Landscape genetics refers to studies that combine population genetics with landscape ecology. In this issue, 
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Cruzan and Hendrickson (2020)</xref> describe strategies for incorporating the separate contributions of pollen (male gametophytes) and seed (sporophytes) dispersal, as well as plant habitat quality, into landscape genetic studies. Application of their approach to the analysis of seed dispersal in three plant species revealed that landscape resistance explains patterns of gene flow better than geographic distance. Counterintuitively, rates of gene flow were lower in high-quality than in low-quality habitat, implying that much remains to be understood about dispersal processes.
