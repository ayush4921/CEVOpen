<p id="p0050">Invasive species are another favorite topic of evolutionary biologists because they represent evolutionary experiments taking place on ecological timescales. A common observation is that plants from the introduced range of a species (i.e., invasive populations) are larger, grow faster, and are more fecund than plants from the native range. A widely held explanation for this pattern, as well as for the overall success of the invaders, is that invasive plants trade off tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses for increased performance. In this issue, 
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Hodgins et al. (2020)</xref> investigate this hypothesis in the noxious weed, Canada thistle (
 <italic>Cirsium arvense</italic>), which is native to Eurasia, but has invaded all other continents except Antarctica. Using a common garden approach, the performance of native European and introduced North American populations was tested under five different stresses, as well under benign conditions. Although the invaders did outperform native populations as predicted, the study failed to find evidence of trade-offs, despite the large number of stresses that were tested.
