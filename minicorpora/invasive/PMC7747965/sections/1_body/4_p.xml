<p id="p0030">Whereas the impact of selection on genomic variation has arguably attracted the greatest attention from evolutionary biologists, the effects of genetic drift are a close second in attention received. This is because of the influence of neutral theory, which holds that most molecular variants are selectively neutral and their distribution within and between species is governed by random genetic drift rather than selection. As a consequence, there is considerable interest in how demographic processes such as population bottlenecks, population expansions, admixture, and mating system affect the strength of genetic drift and efficacy of selection. However, it can be challenging to disentangle the role of these different processes. Using resequencing data from 
 <italic>Arabis lyrata</italic> (a close relative of 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic>), 
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Willi et al. (2020, this issue)</xref> were able to exploit variation in mating system and in the geographic distribution of populations following postglacial expansion to assess the impact of these different processes on levels of genetic diversity and signatures of positive selection. They found that, as predicted by theory, genetic diversity was significantly reduced in selfing populations and populations furthest from glacial refugia. Also, evidence of positive selection increased with admixture, which might imply that genetic variation is limiting rates of evolution in non-admixed populations. Overall, these demographic processes accounted for approximately 60% of variation in genomic diversity and &gt;50% of variation in signatures of positive selection.
