<p id="p0065">In general, the current results of the leaf extracts showed relatively higher larvicidal potentiality against 
 <italic>R. ferrugineus</italic> larvae, where root extract showed less potentiality than the other plant parts. Also, the relative efficiency of the plant parts extracts against 
 <italic>R. ferrugineus</italic> larvae can be ordered for its stronger larvicidal effect as follows; leaf, flower, stem and then root, respectively.
