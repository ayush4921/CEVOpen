<p id="p0015">Biological control agents against 
 <italic>R. ferrugineus</italic> have been explored for decades where many studies have evaluated the potentiality of existing predators and parasites that can eliminate the aforementioned insect. For example, 
 <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">Mahmud et al, (2015)</xref> reported an incident when 
 <italic>Platymerus laevicollis</italic> was introduced to Sri Lanka from Western Samoa as a potential predator of 
 <italic>Oryctes rhinoceros</italic> and instead it was discovered to prefer 
 <italic>R. ferrugineus</italic>. In addition, 
 <italic>Chelisoches morio</italic> nymphs was reported to consume 5.3 
 <italic>R. ferrugineus</italic> weevil eggs and 4.2 weevil larvae per day, whereas, adult insects of 
 <italic>C. morio</italic> consume 8.5 weevil eggs and 6.7 weevil larvae per day (
 <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">Abraham and Kurian, 1973</xref>). Also, oil derivative from garlic and its synthetic form diallyl disulphide were found to be toxic to RPW weevil. 
 <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">Hallett et al. (1999)</xref> described how pheromones can be used as a biocontrol against 
 <italic>R. ferrugineus</italic> and detailed protocols were described for pheromone-based mass trapping of the weevil. Pheromone lures for the RWP weevil in palm date farms in Saudi Arabia have been evaluated nearly two decades ago and outcomes showed that high release lures (Ferrolure and Ferrolure+) obtained from ChemTica Natural, Costa Rica, have the potential to attract twice as many weevils as low release lures (
 <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">Faleiro et al. 1999</xref>). Therefore, it is well documented that botanical materials are important source for insecticides (
 <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">Isman, 2006</xref>). Accordingly, the current study aimed to investigate the larvicidal effect of 
 <italic>Nicotiana glauca</italic> aqueous extracts against the red palm weevil larvae.
