0: Biological control agents against  R. ferrugineus have been explored for decades where many studies have evaluated the potentiality of existing predators and parasites that can eliminate the aforementioned insect.
1: For example,  Mahmud et al, (2015) reported an incident when  Platymerus laevicollis was introduced to Sri Lanka from Western Samoa as a potential predator of  Oryctes rhinoceros and instead it was discovered to prefer  R. ferrugineus.
2: In addition,  Chelisoches morio nymphs was reported to consume 5.3  R. ferrugineus weevil eggs and 4.2 weevil larvae per day, whereas, adult insects of  C. morio consume 8.5 weevil eggs and 6.7 weevil larvae per day ( Abraham and Kurian, 1973).
3: Also, oil derivative from garlic and its synthetic form diallyl disulphide were found to be toxic to RPW weevil.
4: Hallett et al.
5: (1999) described how pheromones can be used as a biocontrol against  R. ferrugineus and detailed protocols were described for pheromone-based mass trapping of the weevil.
6: Pheromone lures for the RWP weevil in palm date farms in Saudi Arabia have been evaluated nearly two decades ago and outcomes showed that high release lures (Ferrolure and Ferrolure+) obtained from ChemTica Natural, Costa Rica, have the potential to attract twice as many weevils as low release lures ( Faleiro et al.
7: 1999).
8: Therefore, it is well documented that botanical materials are important source for insecticides ( Isman, 2006).
9: Accordingly, the current study aimed to investigate the larvicidal effect of  Nicotiana glauca aqueous extracts against the red palm weevil larvae.
