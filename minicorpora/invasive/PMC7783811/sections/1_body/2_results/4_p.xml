<p id="p0050">Also, the flower extract was used to test the susceptibility of 
 <italic>R. ferrugineus</italic> larvae at the concentrations of 2.8, 4.2, 6.0, 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. Results showed that percentage of mortalities were as follows; 55, 70, 75, 80 and 85, respectively. The concentrations reflected an LC
 <sub>50</sub> of 2.6 ppm, an LC
 <sub>95</sub> of 9.6 ppm. The lowest concentration (2.8 ppm) produced 55% mortality, whereas the highest concentration (8 ppm) reflected 85% mortality and the R-square was 0.76.
