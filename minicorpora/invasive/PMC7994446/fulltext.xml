As a consequence, the interest in the application of environmental DNA (eDNA) survey techniques has increased. The use of eDNA extracted from faeces from generalist predators, have recently been described as &#x0201c;biodiversity capsules&#x0201d; and suggested as a complementary tool for improving current biodiversity assessments. In this study, using faecal samples from two generalist omnivore species, the Eurasian badger and the red fox, we evaluated the applicability of eDNA metabarcoding in determining dietary composition, compared to macroscopic diet identification techniques. Subsequently, we used the dietary information obtained to assess its contribution to biodiversity assessments. Compared to classic macroscopic techniques, we found that eDNA metabarcoding detected more taxa, at higher taxonomic resolution, and proved to be an important technique to verify the species identification of the predator from field collected faeces. Furthermore, we showed how dietary analyses complemented field observations in describing biodiversity by identifying consumed flora and fauna that went unnoticed during field observations. While diet analysis approaches could not substitute field observations entirely, we suggest that their integration with other methods might overcome intrinsic limitations of single techniques in future biodiversity surveys.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Biological techniques</kwd><kwd>Ecology</kwd><kwd>Molecular biology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>15.

Thus, rapid, habitat-specific and non-invasive biodiversity assessments are urgently needed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Biodiversity has been assessed, at varying geographic scales, by a variety of methods such as flight trapping, pitfall traps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, acoustic surveys<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, camera traps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> and field observations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. While these methods have been designed for application to specific environments, study systems, and species, they have several drawbacks and limitations. For example, approaches based on visual observation and acoustic detection are highly dependent on the identification skills of the operator<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Additional challenges are constituted by biases in overall species occurrence, seasonality, behaviour and changes in community composition due to alternation in species distribution (e.g. sink or marginal areas) or to environmental fluctuations (e.g. temporal ponds, succession stages)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Physical survey methods (e.g. trapping) are invasive, and therefore often not applicable when dealing with species of conservation concern. Furthermore, conventional methods (as described above) are constrained by a species behaviour and body size, and are highly time consuming<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. As a consequence, biodiversity survey techniques that are less dependent on direct behavioural observations, and are less invasive have gained increasing interest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">In particular, amplicon sequencing of DNA from various sources of environmental samples (eDNA), using a metabarcoding approach, allows for the taxonomical characterisation of organismal matter contained in complex mixtures such as soil, water, air, stomach content and animal faeces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. A major benefit of eDNA metabarcoding for biodiversity surveys, compared to earlier mentioned methods, is that it enables efficient and non-invasive species detection with relatively small effort (and continuously decreasing price), even for large scale surveys<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. eDNA metabarcoding is now widely applied to various terrestrial and aquatic samples, both ancient and modern, showing great potential for use in biodiversity monitoring and ecological studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. For example, specific ecological applications include verifying species presence and potential range expansion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, uncovering drivers of community composition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and estimating species richness and diversity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. In addition, the method has proven highly useful for diet analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> and derived applications such as unravelling food webs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, predator&#x02013;prey interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, herbivore ecosystem function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> and niche breadth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Among the possible eDNA sources for diet analysis, faeces from generalist predators have recently been described as &#x0201c;biodiversity capsules&#x0201d; and a complementary tool for improving current biodiversity assessments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. This concept stems from the fact that generalist predators and omnivore species forage on a large variety of food resources in their habitat. Therefore, compositional studies of their faeces may reveal a broad spectrum of the species occurring within their home range. Only few studies so far have incorporated DNA based diet composition information from generalist, opportunistic and omnivore predator species in biodiversity assessments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Studies using both faecal and stomach content have shown the applicability of eDNA metabarcoding to detect consumed flora and fauna biodiversity, with particular advantage in environments that are difficult to sample, since this technique can identify more species than traditional methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. However, previous work also identified some important pitfalls of faecal dietary analysis in ecological surveys. Specifically, geographic distance and time lag between consumption of the prey and deposition of the faeces can hamper assumptions on spatial and temporal patterns of species presence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, but also the time from faecal dropping to collection, as well as the substrate, can influence detection accuracy of eDNA methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. An additional important aspect is that, while predator diet is generally assumed to reflect abundance and diversity of prey species in the predator foraging area, the diet is also influenced by predator behaviour and preferences in its ecosystem, which will, to varying extent, bias detection of the species present in the study area<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Validation studies, including parallel comparisons of multiple survey methods, and evaluation of the detection bias in areas with existing ecosystem monitoring data are therefore important in order to assess the usefulness of faecal compositional analysis as a complementary biodiversity monitoring tool.</p><p id="Par5">With this in mind, we empirically evaluate if, and to what extent, eDNA metabarcoding analysis of faecal samples from generalist predators collected non-invasively can be used as a tool for characterising and monitoring the biodiversity at a particular study site. To do this, we focus on two predatory generalist omnivore species, the Eurasian badger (<italic>Meles meles</italic>) and the red fox (<italic>Vulpes vulpes</italic>) in a protected area in Denmark, for which a comprehensive species inventory list is available, providing an overview on the areas long-term biodiversity. Specifically, we: i) use eDNA metabarcoding on non-invasively collected faecal samples to assess the diet of the two omnivorous predatory species by applying universal markers covering the plant, vertebrate and invertebrate components of the diet, ii) assess the effect of environmental exposure (faecal age since deposition) on eDNA metabarcoding detection efficiency, iii) compare eDNA metabarcoding results to macroscopic diet assessment, iv) compare the list of prey species detected in the diet by eDNA and macroscopic identification techniques to the comprehensive species list achieved by traditional field observations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study area and sample collection</title><p id="Par6">Faecal samples from foxes and badgers were collected from April to December 2015 in Lille Vildmose, Denmark (56&#x000b0;53&#x02032;15&#x02033;N 10&#x000b0;13&#x02032;14&#x02033;E; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Permission needed for survey were obtained from concerned institutions including Aage V. Jensen&#x02019;s foundation. The area covers 8000&#x000a0;ha and is separated into two fully protected and fenced areas (H&#x000f8;stemark 568&#x000a0;ha; and Tofte Skov 4000&#x000a0;ha), and two areas open to the public (Portlandsmosen and Paraplymosen). In this study, we surveyed the two fully protected areas where human impact is minimal. Sampling within these fenced areas ensured that the faecal samples included in the analysis were unlikely to contain prey species from outside of the intended sampling area (e.g. movement and foraging was limited to within the fenced area), and prey species retained from faecal content were therefore directly comparable with field observations from the study area. Recent research has documented that the permanently fenced (since 1906) and grazed forests of Tofte Skov and H&#x000f8;stemark (since 1933) contain an unusually high biodiversity compared to other areas in Denmark<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, and is therefore of particular interest.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Location of the sampling area, Lille Vildmose in Denmark.

Surveys were performed by trained personnel with good skills in distinguishing wildlife faecal matters. Although other species with morphologically similar faecal structures are potentially present in the area (e.g. raccoon dog, <italic>Nyctereutes procyonoides</italic>, or various mustelid species like American mink, <italic>Mustela neovison</italic> or marten species such as <italic>Martes martes</italic>), badger faeces are characterized by their deposition in latrines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> whereas fox faeces are usually identified by their characteristic structure and deposition at marking locations. While the deposition of faecal material in latrines can lead to sample non-independence for badger, this bias would not affect conclusions of biodiversity estimates for the study area. The age (days since deposition) of collected faecal samples was estimated based on visual inspection and time since the previous survey and was used to pool the samples into two age categories (&#x0003c;&#x02009;7 and&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;7&#x000a0;days). The latter information was used to assess if DNA degradation, due to longer sample exposure to environmental factors, has major effects on DNA metabarcoding results and can therefore compromise the use of predator faeces for biodiversity assessments.</p><p id="Par8">Upon collection, all samples were placed in a cooler with ice elements and subsequently transferred to &#x02212;&#x02009;20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C until analysis.

The main food categories detected with both molecular and macroscopic approaches in this study showed a good level of concordance with previous macroscopic studies conducted in Denmark<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>, but the eDNA metabarcoding approach retrieved a larger number of dietary components and with higher taxonomic resolution than the macroscopic analysis. Such finding emphasises the usefulness of eDNA in dietary analysis, but also flags that differences exist in the bias associated with various diet identification methods.</p><p id="Par33">Both fox and badger are considered omnivores, but with a larger proportion of the diet constituted by protein sources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. Our observations are in overall agreement with this expectation, with the majority of fox samples including a combination of all food components. For badger faeces, we likewise report a large proportion of samples with all three major food components present, but they were preferentially constituted by a combination of plant and invertebrate sequences, highlighting that, although partly overlapping, the diet of these two species is somewhat differentiated (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). However, our eDNA results showed a large number of sequences identifying plant material for both omnivores, an observation confirmed by macroscopic analysis for badger but not for fox. This deviation from the expected diet can be partly explained by the plasticity of the species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>, and by the fact that we combined data collected during seasons with different productivity levels which might induce temporal deviations from the preferred food intake<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. In this context, a larger sample size from each season would allow inferences on temporal variation in diet composition of both predators within the study area and provide more accurate estimates of biodiversity. In addition, with the eDNA approach, we did not employ markers targeting <italic>oligochaete</italic>, an important food component for the badger, inducing differences in the dietary conclusions reached using macroscopic <italic>vs.</italic> eDNA metabarcoding.</p><p id="Par34">Another notable difference between eDNA metabarcoding and macroscopic results is the differential detectability of some taxa. For example, gastropods and, possibly, amphibians are more difficult to identify with macroscopic analysis since they are mostly constituted by soft parts that are easily degraded or become unrecognisable during the digestion process, while insects are more easily identified with this method due to their exoskeleton that assures the survival of diagnostics characteristics. In contrast, eDNA metabarcoding might be able to identify diet components that leave no morphologically recognisable remains in the faecal sample, and might even be able to pick up the signal of prey components present as traces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Rare and accidentally ingested food components are expected to occur at low frequencies in the samples and may contribute to increased dietary diversity estimates by the eDNA metabarcoding approach, as supported by the rarefaction curves. This also suggests that higher sample sizes could potentially further increase the number of taxa detected with eDNA metabarcoding, particularly at genus and family level. In contrast, macroscopic identification revealed overall lower sample richness, regardless of the taxonomic level in focus. While this aspect has to be accounted for when interpreting eDNA metabarcoding results for diet assessments, it has useful implications in the context of biodiversity surveys. However, taxa detectability varies in metabarcoding approaches as well, due to a number of widely acknowledged biological and technical reasons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup> that should be considered when designing a study and drawing inferences.</p><p id="Par35">Interestingly, and in contrast to previously published expectations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, detection performance (number of taxa and reads obtained) using the eDNA metabarcoding approach was not influenced by the age of the sample, confirming robustness of the markers and efficacy of the sequence filtering protocols applied. However, we observed differences in the taxonomic resolution in relation to the age of our samples, which was not directly tested in the above-mentioned studies. We found that resolution was unchanged among identifications with the plant and vertebrate marker, but species level assignations decreased considerably, although not with statistical significance, for the invertebrate marker in older samples. In addition, with the invertebrate marker, we observed an increase in family identifications and a reduction in order attributions with increasing age of the sample (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C). This may be due to differences in the sample composition, but we cannot exclude possible contamination due to colonization of the sample by insects over time prior to collection. Thus, given the number of ecological and temporal variables that are likely to influence these results, we recommend collection of fresh samples for eDNA metabarcoding diet analyses.</p><p id="Par36">Our study, revealing high performance of eDNA metabarcoding and its complementarity to macroscopic analyses, adds to previous research supporting the integration of dietary approaches in biodiversity surveys and monitoring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>. Indeed, eDNA based methods are increasingly applied in monitoring of vertebrates and invertebrates from water or soil samples (see<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>). Our approach demonstrates an additional application of eDNA metabarcoding in the monitoring of biodiversity by use of non-invasively collected faecal samples from local omnivorous predators.</p><p id="Par37">Field observations from the sampling area revealed an overall higher species and order diversity, which was not unexpected since field observation data were collected over a long timeframe (regular surveys between 1929 and 2016, see Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>), combined with the fact that generalist predators do not feed on all available prey components in a habitat, but try to match their macronutrients requirements by minimal effort. Additionally, prey detected with the dietary approaches may be locally clustered with regard to the two predators foraging habitat. Prey availability and accessibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>, and the presence of other potential competing species could also influence dietary preferences. However, our diet analyses detected an additional 25 orders (and 42 species), which went undetected by field observations. This suggests that dietary studies provide the opportunity to identify rare and potentially novel species in a given study area, depending on the dietary preferences of the predator studied. It should be noted that among the two dietary approaches, the eDNA metabarcoding approach led to the largest number of additional orders (23), while the macroscopic analysis identified 4 additional orders which were not identified by field surveys nor eDNA metabarcoding. While some of the taxa identified by the eDNA metabarcoding only might be attributed to misassignments due to the absence of an appropriate reference sequence in the EMBL database, others might result from recent introductions since the last survey, like in the case of edible or horticultural plants, or natural invasions, such as alien moss or coleoptera and gastropod species.</p><p id="Par38">Our order-level analysis furthermore suggests that certain components of biodiversity, and therefore their associated ecosystem function, could be systematically underestimated by field surveys. A number of reasons may explain this pattern. First, common species, such as slugs or common house fly, may not be noted during field surveys due to their common occurrence (and, thereby potentially not considered important for biodiversity). Next, rare species in low population density, or elusive species, may be difficult to detect, even if surveys are repeated over time. Indeed, the use of local predators as sampling assistants may thereby aid the compilation of species inventories, as supported by the observation that both dietary approaches identified a number of species which may present cryptic behaviours. For example, insect and lice species that live in bark, and&#x000a0;slugs that are mostly active during and after heavy rain or live underground, were detected using eDNA metabarcoding, but absent in field observations. Detection of such species in the field may be particularly cumbersome and require invasive sampling, which is adverted by use of &#x0201c;sampling assistants&#x0201d; in the form of faecal material deposited by local omnivore predators. While dietary approaches cannot substitute field observations entirely for biodiversity assessments, due to the limitations described above, their integration with other methods would likely improve our current understanding of community composition. Particularly, the bias associated with each of the applied methods differs broadly, and complementing these methods thereby paints a much more robust picture of biodiversity within a given study area.</p><p id="Par39">To compensate for biases caused by the predators&#x02019; preferences, behaviour, and individual choices in terms of food selection, habitat use and activity patterns, the combination of multiple predator species, preferably showing only partially overlapping food preferences, could be applied like in the present study where we included faecal samples from badger, fox and marten. In addition, compared&#x000a0;to observational studies typically requiring long time periods for implementation, diet analysis, particularly through eDNA metabarcoding, can be efficiently performed on large samples sizes from a single sampling event and can be repeated over time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. This would allow timely detection of changes in prey community composition that could be related to prey distributional shifts as a consequence of climate modifications or human exploitation and invasive species. eDNA metabarcoding diet analysis of selected generalist predators, utilizing appropriate sampling strategies and relevant markers covering the full diet spectrum, can effectively contribute to biodiversity monitoring and provide timely information necessary to cope with rapid anthropogenically driven environmental changes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><sec id="Sec14"><p>
