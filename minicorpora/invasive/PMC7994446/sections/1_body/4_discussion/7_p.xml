<p id="Par37">Field observations from the sampling area revealed an overall higher species and order diversity, which was not unexpected since field observation data were collected over a long timeframe (regular surveys between 1929 and 2016, see Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>), combined with the fact that generalist predators do not feed on all available prey components in a habitat, but try to match their macronutrients requirements by minimal effort. Additionally, prey detected with the dietary approaches may be locally clustered with regard to the two predators foraging habitat. Prey availability and accessibility

 </sup>, and the presence of other potential competing species could also influence dietary preferences. However, our diet analyses detected an additional 25 orders (and 42 species), which went undetected by field observations. This suggests that dietary studies provide the opportunity to identify rare and potentially novel species in a given study area, depending on the dietary preferences of the predator studied. It should be noted that among the two dietary approaches, the eDNA metabarcoding approach led to the largest number of additional orders (23), while the macroscopic analysis identified 4 additional orders which were not identified by field surveys nor eDNA metabarcoding. While some of the taxa identified by the eDNA metabarcoding only might be attributed to misassignments due to the absence of an appropriate reference sequence in the EMBL database, others might result from recent introductions since the last survey, like in the case of edible or horticultural plants, or natural invasions, such as alien moss or coleoptera and gastropod species.
