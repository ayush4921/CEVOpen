 </sup>. In this study, we found that eDNA metabarcoding applied to faecal samples of red fox and Eurasian badger complemented and refined results of macroscopic diet analysis, improving detection and taxonomic resolution. In addition, our results suggest that dietary analysis of omnivore predators can improve information about habitat specific biodiversity, particularly when methods are combined. In accordance to other recent eDNA studies
