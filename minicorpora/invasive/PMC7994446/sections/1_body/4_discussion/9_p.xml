<p id="Par39">To compensate for biases caused by the predators’ preferences, behaviour, and individual choices in terms of food selection, habitat use and activity patterns, the combination of multiple predator species, preferably showing only partially overlapping food preferences, could be applied like in the present study where we included faecal samples from badger, fox and marten. In addition, compared to observational studies typically requiring long time periods for implementation, diet analysis, particularly through eDNA metabarcoding, can be efficiently performed on large samples sizes from a single sampling event and can be repeated over time

 </sup>. This would allow timely detection of changes in prey community composition that could be related to prey distributional shifts as a consequence of climate modifications or human exploitation and invasive species. eDNA metabarcoding diet analysis of selected generalist predators, utilizing appropriate sampling strategies and relevant markers covering the full diet spectrum, can effectively contribute to biodiversity monitoring and provide timely information necessary to cope with rapid anthropogenically driven environmental changes.
