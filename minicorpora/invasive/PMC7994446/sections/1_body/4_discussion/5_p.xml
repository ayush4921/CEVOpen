 </sup>, detection performance (number of taxa and reads obtained) using the eDNA metabarcoding approach was not influenced by the age of the sample, confirming robustness of the markers and efficacy of the sequence filtering protocols applied. However, we observed differences in the taxonomic resolution in relation to the age of our samples, which was not directly tested in the above-mentioned studies. We found that resolution was unchanged among identifications with the plant and vertebrate marker, but species level assignations decreased considerably, although not with statistical significance, for the invertebrate marker in older samples. In addition, with the invertebrate marker, we observed an increase in family identifications and a reduction in order attributions with increasing age of the sample (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C). This may be due to differences in the sample composition, but we cannot exclude possible contamination due to colonization of the sample by insects over time prior to collection. Thus, given the number of ecological and temporal variables that are likely to influence these results, we recommend collection of fresh samples for eDNA metabarcoding diet analyses.
