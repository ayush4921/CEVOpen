<p id="Par34">Another notable difference between eDNA metabarcoding and macroscopic results is the differential detectability of some taxa. For example, gastropods and, possibly, amphibians are more difficult to identify with macroscopic analysis since they are mostly constituted by soft parts that are easily degraded or become unrecognisable during the digestion process, while insects are more easily identified with this method due to their exoskeleton that assures the survival of diagnostics characteristics. In contrast, eDNA metabarcoding might be able to identify diet components that leave no morphologically recognisable remains in the faecal sample, and might even be able to pick up the signal of prey components present as traces

 </sup>. Rare and accidentally ingested food components are expected to occur at low frequencies in the samples and may contribute to increased dietary diversity estimates by the eDNA metabarcoding approach, as supported by the rarefaction curves. This also suggests that higher sample sizes could potentially further increase the number of taxa detected with eDNA metabarcoding, particularly at genus and family level. In contrast, macroscopic identification revealed overall lower sample richness, regardless of the taxonomic level in focus. While this aspect has to be accounted for when interpreting eDNA metabarcoding results for diet assessments, it has useful implications in the context of biodiversity surveys. However, taxa detectability varies in metabarcoding approaches as well, due to a number of widely acknowledged biological and technical reasons
