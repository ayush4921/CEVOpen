 </sup>. Our observations are in overall agreement with this expectation, with the majority of fox samples including a combination of all food components. For badger faeces, we likewise report a large proportion of samples with all three major food components present, but they were preferentially constituted by a combination of plant and invertebrate sequences, highlighting that, although partly overlapping, the diet of these two species is somewhat differentiated (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). However, our eDNA results showed a large number of sequences identifying plant material for both omnivores, an observation confirmed by macroscopic analysis for badger but not for fox. This deviation from the expected diet can be partly explained by the plasticity of the species
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>
 </sup>, and by the fact that we combined data collected during seasons with different productivity levels which might induce temporal deviations from the preferred food intake

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>
 </sup>. In this context, a larger sample size from each season would allow inferences on temporal variation in diet composition of both predators within the study area and provide more accurate estimates of biodiversity. In addition, with the eDNA approach, we did not employ markers targeting
