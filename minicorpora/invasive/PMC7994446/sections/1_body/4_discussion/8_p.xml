<p id="Par38">Our order-level analysis furthermore suggests that certain components of biodiversity, and therefore their associated ecosystem function, could be systematically underestimated by field surveys. A number of reasons may explain this pattern. First, common species, such as slugs or common house fly, may not be noted during field surveys due to their common occurrence (and, thereby potentially not considered important for biodiversity). Next, rare species in low population density, or elusive species, may be difficult to detect, even if surveys are repeated over time. Indeed, the use of local predators as sampling assistants may thereby aid the compilation of species inventories, as supported by the observation that both dietary approaches identified a number of species which may present cryptic behaviours. For example, insect and lice species that live in bark, and slugs that are mostly active during and after heavy rain or live underground, were detected using eDNA metabarcoding, but absent in field observations. Detection of such species in the field may be particularly cumbersome and require invasive sampling, which is adverted by use of “sampling assistants” in the form of faecal material deposited by local omnivore predators. While dietary approaches cannot substitute field observations entirely for biodiversity assessments, due to the limitations described above, their integration with other methods would likely improve our current understanding of community composition. Particularly, the bias associated with each of the applied methods differs broadly, and complementing these methods thereby paints a much more robust picture of biodiversity within a given study area.</p>
