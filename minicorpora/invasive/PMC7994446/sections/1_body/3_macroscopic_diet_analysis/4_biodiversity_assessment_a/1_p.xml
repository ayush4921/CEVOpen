<p id="Par28">We compared the list of species observed in the field (observation data) to eDNA metabarcoding and macroscopic diet analyses, to assess whether dietary information from non-invasively collected faecal samples from generalist predators can be used in biodiversity assessments. In this comparison, we included the 13 marten samples, since this species is common in Denmark and may contribute to biodiversity estimates derived from faecal analysis.</p>
