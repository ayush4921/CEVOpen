<p id="Par30">Importantly, the two diet identification approaches revealed information about orders and species that went unnoticed during field observations. In fact, diet identifications led to the detection of 42 species and 25 orders, which were not observed in the field survey (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Six out of the 42 species (and one order without species identification; 
 <italic>Zingiberales</italic>) were most likely not present in the study area. However, for all these species, either the genus or family was likely to be present in the sampling area, suggesting that the lack of an appropriate reference in the sequence database might have led to the identification of an incorrect, but closely related, species. Additionally, 13 of the prey species not recorded by field observations might represent later introduction as edible plants (
 <italic>e.g.</italic> the American cranberry, 
 <italic>Vaccinium macrocarpon</italic>) or invasive species (
 <italic>e.g.</italic> the alien moss, 
 <italic>Orthodontium lineare</italic>). However, for many of the potentially introduced species, limited information on distribution is available and it was therefore not possible to assess whether these detections were legitimate (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>).
