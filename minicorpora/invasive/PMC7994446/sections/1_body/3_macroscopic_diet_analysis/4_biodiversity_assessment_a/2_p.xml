<p id="Par29">We found that the addition of dietary information to field observations resulted in a noteworthy increase in the number of different detections at the order level (22% increase when combining diet analysis and field observations, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). However, when analysing biodiversity at the species level, the addition of prey species derived from dietary analysis did not significantly improve the number of species detected (an increase of 1.4%). Overall, the eDNA metabarcoding approach improved biodiversity assessment the most, when combined with field observations. eDNA methods identified 20% additional orders and 1.2% additional species as compared to 4% additional orders and 0.2% and additional species by macroscopic analysis. Finally, we found that the combination of all methods (field observations, eDNA metabarcoding and macroscopic identification) generated the best coverage (highest richness) of orders present in the area (Table
