<p id="Par27">Overall, we found that eDNA metabarcoding led to higher taxonomic resolution and higher prey diversity, compared to the macroscopic diet analysis, and this pattern was consistent for both fox and badger (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). When assessing the number of diet components identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level, eDNA metabarcoding consistently outperformed the macroscopic analysis, especially at the genus and species levels (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Similarly, rarefaction curves (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) showed that eDNA metabarcoding consistently resulted in higher richness and the curves did not level off.
