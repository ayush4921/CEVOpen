<p id="Par25">Using the macroscopic diet identification technique, 61% and 58% of all dietary identifications were classified to class level, 20% and 13% to order level, 3% and 16% to family, 10% and 7% to genus, and only 5% and 5% to species level, in badger and fox samples, respectively. Overall, invertebrate and plant material were the most frequently occurring diet components in badger samples (43% and 30% occurrences), whereas vertebrate and plant material were predominant in fox (54% and 28%, respectively) (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Importantly, macroscopic diet analysis revealed the presence of earthworms in 86% of badger samples, but none in fox samples.
