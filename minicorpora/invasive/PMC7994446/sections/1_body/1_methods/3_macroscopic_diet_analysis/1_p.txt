0: Faecal samples were visually investigated, and non-diet surface contamination was removed ( i.e.
1: invertebrate decomposers or biological matter such as grass).
2: All samples were weighted on a digital scale, transferred into a 20 cm diameter 750 m sieve, gently rinsed with 500 mL water, and the off-cut water was collected for sedimentation.
3: Sediments (2 mL) were transferred to a petri dish for identification of earthworm cilia following standard procedures 46.
4: Diet components were separated into 11 dietary categories ( Amphibia,  Arachnida,  Aves,  Diplopoda,  Gastropoda,  Insecta,  Malacostraca,  Mammalia,  Oligochaeta,  Reptilia and  Plantae) and identified to the lowest possible taxonomic resolution.
5: Diet components that could not be allocated to any specific category were classified as Unidentified.
