<p id="Par13">Faecal samples were visually investigated, and non-diet surface contamination was removed (
 <italic>i.e.</italic> invertebrate decomposers or biological matter such as grass). All samples were weighted on a digital scale, transferred into a 20 cm diameter 750 μm sieve, gently rinsed with 500 mL water, and the off-cut water was collected for sedimentation. Sediments (2 mL) were transferred to a petri dish for identification of earthworm cilia following standard procedures
