 </sup>. Fruits, berries and cereals were classified based on seed structures using reference collections from native plants and field books with illustrations for comparison. Mammalian bones and tissue without guard hairs or other key-identification traits were assigned to “Mammalian prey”, with no further taxonomic classification. We visually estimated the proportion of each diet category in individual samples, relative to the full volume and weight of each faecal sample. Small stones and host hairs were not included in the diet analysis since these components were classified as “Non-diet”.
