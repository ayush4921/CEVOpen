0: To compare the dietary information gathered by use of eDNA metabarcoding versus macroscopic diet analysis, we identified the number of different food components from each method (across all samples within each predator) and compared the taxonomic resolution of the identifications.
1: To evaluate the rate at which new taxa are found within the samples, we generated rarefaction curves of sample richness with 1000 permutations for both methods at all taxonomic levels, using  vegan.
