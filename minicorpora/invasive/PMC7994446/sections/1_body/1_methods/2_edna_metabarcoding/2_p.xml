<p id="Par10">Diet composition was described based on the taxonomically assigned DNA sequences obtained after the quality filtering. For each predator species, we calculated and compared the number of different sequences identified across samples, as well as the number of taxa obtained per sample with each marker. Next, we assessed the taxonomic resolution of diet components by calculating the proportion of sequences identified to order, family, genus and species level, and calculated the frequency of occurrence (FO) of each sequence as the proportion of samples in which a given sequence was found, relative to the total number of samples collected from each predator. We then compared the general extent of omnivory and composition of badger and fox faecal samples by estimating the proportion of samples which comprised one, two or all three diet categories (plants, vertebrates, invertebrates).</p>
