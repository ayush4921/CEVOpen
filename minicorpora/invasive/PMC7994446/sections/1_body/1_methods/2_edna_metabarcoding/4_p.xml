<p id="Par12">To assess the effect of faecal age (estimated time of exposure to environmental DNA degradation), we used only badger faecal samples, since the number of fox samples was too low for this analysis. We tested the effect of faecal age on the total number of taxa and reads per sample, using a two-way ANOVA with primer, DNA quality and their interaction as fixed effects. We also analysed the taxonomic resolution of sequence identifications obtained with each of the three universal markers between samples from the two age categories (&lt; 7 days old, &gt; 7 days old, samples more than 4 weeks old were excluded). For this analysis, we used the function 
 <italic>prop.test</italic>, which is a 2-sample test for equality of the proportion of sequences identified to each taxonomic level (order, family, genus and species) between the two sample age categories. The two age categories are meant to serve as a broad separation between relatively “fresh” and “older” samples that are likely to be significantly affected by DNA degradation as a result of the cumulative effect of multiple factors acting during sample exposure to the environment (see also
