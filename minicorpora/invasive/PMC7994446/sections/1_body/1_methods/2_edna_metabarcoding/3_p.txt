0: The extent of dietary overlap between the two predators was evaluated using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) by computing the  Jaccard distance on the presence-absence matrix of faecal samples versus diet components assigned to taxonomic order level, using the  vegan package v. 2.5-8 44.
1: The dietary uptake of the two predators was statistically compared by a permutational multivariate analysis of variance on the distance matrices using the  adonis function in  vegan.
