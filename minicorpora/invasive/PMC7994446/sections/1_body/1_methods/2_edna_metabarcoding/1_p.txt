0: DNA extraction from collected faecal samples was performed following a protocol described elsewhere 40 with minor modifications (see Supplementary Note  1).
1: Diet analysis was performed by co-amplifying three universal markers, targeting short (< 100 bp) and variable DNA fragments of the plant (on the P6 loop of the chloroplast trnL (UAA) intron), vertebrate (on the V5 loop of the mitochondrial 12S gene) and invertebrate (on the mitochondrial 16S gene) components of the diet (see Supplementary Note  1 for details and marker references).
2: For simplicity, universal markers will throughout the paper be referred to as the target diet categories  i.e.
3: plants, invertebrates and vertebrates.
4: Blocking oligonucleotides were used to minimize amplification of badger, fox and human sequences with the vertebrate marker, and of mammalian and human sequences with the invertebrate marker (Supplementary Note  1 and Table  1).
5: For taxonomic classification, a sequence reference database was built for each eDNA metabarcoding marker by extracting the relevant DNA region for plants, vertebrates, and invertebrates ( Arthropoda and  Mollusca) from EMBL nucleotide library (release 128) using the ecoPCR program 41.
6: Sequence reads were filtered and taxonomically identified following the procedure described in 39 using the OBITools 42 and R v. 3.3.3 43 with modifications described in Supplementary Note  1.
