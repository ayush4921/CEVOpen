 </sup> with minor modifications (see Supplementary Note 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Diet analysis was performed by co-amplifying three universal markers, targeting short (&lt; 100 bp) and variable DNA fragments of the plant (on the P6 loop of the chloroplast trnL (UAA) intron), vertebrate (on the V5 loop of the mitochondrial 12S gene) and invertebrate (on the mitochondrial 16S gene) components of the diet (see Supplementary Note 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> for details and marker references). For simplicity, universal markers will throughout the paper be referred to as the target diet categories 
 <italic>i.e.</italic> plants, invertebrates and vertebrates. Blocking oligonucleotides were used to minimize amplification of badger, fox and human sequences with the vertebrate marker, and of mammalian and human sequences with the invertebrate marker (Supplementary Note 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). For taxonomic classification, a sequence reference database was built for each eDNA metabarcoding marker by extracting the relevant DNA region for plants, vertebrates, and invertebrates (
 <italic>Arthropoda</italic> and 
 <italic>Mollusca</italic>) from EMBL nucleotide library (release 128) using the ecoPCR program
