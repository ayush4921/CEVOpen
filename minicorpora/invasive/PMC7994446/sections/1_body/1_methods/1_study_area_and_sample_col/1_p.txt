0: Faecal samples from foxes and badgers were collected from April to December 2015 in Lille Vildmose, Denmark (565315N 101314E; Fig.
1: 1).
2: Permission needed for survey were obtained from concerned institutions including Aage V. Jensens foundation.
3: The area covers 8000 ha and is separated into two fully protected and fenced areas (Hstemark 568 ha; and Tofte Skov 4000 ha), and two areas open to the public (Portlandsmosen and Paraplymosen).
4: In this study, we surveyed the two fully protected areas where human impact is minimal.
5: Sampling within these fenced areas ensured that the faecal samples included in the analysis were unlikely to contain prey species from outside of the intended sampling area (e.g.
6: movement and foraging was limited to within the fenced area), and prey species retained from faecal content were therefore directly comparable with field observations from the study area.
7: Recent research has documented that the permanently fenced (since 1906) and grazed forests of Tofte Skov and Hstemark (since 1933) contain an unusually high biodiversity compared to other areas in Denmark 37, and is therefore of particular interest.
