0: Surveys were performed weekly (with few exceptions) from April to December 2015 in both areas and were primarily focused on locations where installation of camera-traps had verified the presence of the focal predators.
1: Surveys were performed by trained personnel with good skills in distinguishing wildlife faecal matters.
2: Although other species with morphologically similar faecal structures are potentially present in the area (e.g.
3: raccoon dog,  Nyctereutes procyonoides, or various mustelid species like American mink,  Mustela neovison or marten species such as  Martes martes), badger faeces are characterized by their deposition in latrines 38 whereas fox faeces are usually identified by their characteristic structure and deposition at marking locations.
4: While the deposition of faecal material in latrines can lead to sample non-independence for badger, this bias would not affect conclusions of biodiversity estimates for the study area.
5: The age (days since deposition) of collected faecal samples was estimated based on visual inspection and time since the previous survey and was used to pool the samples into two age categories (< 7 and > 7 days).
6: The latter information was used to assess if DNA degradation, due to longer sample exposure to environmental factors, has major effects on DNA metabarcoding results and can therefore compromise the use of predator faeces for biodiversity assessments.
