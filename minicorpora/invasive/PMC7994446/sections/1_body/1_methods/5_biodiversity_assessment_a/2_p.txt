0: We compared this aggregated species list with the species information obtained from the two dietary approaches ( i.e.
1: eDNA metabarcoding and macroscopic analysis).
2: We investigated the taxonomic richness described by each method by assessing the total number of different orders and species detected by each method (diet approaches individually and combined).
3: We then calculated the overall number of matches at species and order level among the three methods (and between the predators), to assess the coverage of each approach in describing the biodiversity in Lille Vildmose.
4: The amount (and lack) of overlap among the three methods was then used as a proxy for understanding whether, and to what extent, the prey diversity obtained by analysing faecal samples from generalist omnivore predators compares to species richness estimates obtained by field observations.
