<p id="Par2">Anthropogenic influences on ecosystems are currently causing devastating changes and we are now observing increased rates of species extinction, loss of biodiversity and, as a consequence, loss of ecosystem functioning

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>
 </sup>. Thus, rapid, habitat-specific and non-invasive biodiversity assessments are urgently needed
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>
 </sup>. Biodiversity has been assessed, at varying geographic scales, by a variety of methods such as flight trapping, pitfall traps
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
 </sup> and field observations
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>
 </sup>. While these methods have been designed for application to specific environments, study systems, and species, they have several drawbacks and limitations. For example, approaches based on visual observation and acoustic detection are highly dependent on the identification skills of the operator

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>
 </sup>. Additional challenges are constituted by biases in overall species occurrence, seasonality, behaviour and changes in community composition due to alternation in species distribution (e.g. sink or marginal areas) or to environmental fluctuations (e.g. temporal ponds, succession stages)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>
 </sup>. Physical survey methods (e.g. trapping) are invasive, and therefore often not applicable when dealing with species of conservation concern. Furthermore, conventional methods (as described above) are constrained by a species behaviour and body size, and are highly time consuming
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>
 </sup>. As a consequence, biodiversity survey techniques that are less dependent on direct behavioural observations, and are less invasive have gained increasing interest
