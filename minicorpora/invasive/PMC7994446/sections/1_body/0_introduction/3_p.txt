0: Among the possible eDNA sources for diet analysis, faeces from generalist predators have recently been described as biodiversity capsules and a complementary tool for improving current biodiversity assessments 30,  31.
1: This concept stems from the fact that generalist predators and omnivore species forage on a large variety of food resources in their habitat.
2: Therefore, compositional studies of their faeces may reveal a broad spectrum of the species occurring within their home range.
3: Only few studies so far have incorporated DNA based diet composition information from generalist, opportunistic and omnivore predator species in biodiversity assessments 30,  32,  33.
4: Studies using both faecal and stomach content have shown the applicability of eDNA metabarcoding to detect consumed flora and fauna biodiversity, with particular advantage in environments that are difficult to sample, since this technique can identify more species than traditional methods 34,  35.
5: However, previous work also identified some important pitfalls of faecal dietary analysis in ecological surveys.
6: Specifically, geographic distance and time lag between consumption of the prey and deposition of the faeces can hamper assumptions on spatial and temporal patterns of species presence 32,  35, but also the time from faecal dropping to collection, as well as the substrate, can influence detection accuracy of eDNA methods 36.
7: An additional important aspect is that, while predator diet is generally assumed to reflect abundance and diversity of prey species in the predator foraging area, the diet is also influenced by predator behaviour and preferences in its ecosystem, which will, to varying extent, bias detection of the species present in the study area 31.
8: Validation studies, including parallel comparisons of multiple survey methods, and evaluation of the detection bias in areas with existing ecosystem monitoring data are therefore important in order to assess the usefulness of faecal compositional analysis as a complementary biodiversity monitoring tool.
