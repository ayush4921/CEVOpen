0: In particular, amplicon sequencing of DNA from various sources of environmental samples (eDNA), using a metabarcoding approach, allows for the taxonomical characterisation of organismal matter contained in complex mixtures such as soil, water, air, stomach content and animal faeces 12,  13.
1: A major benefit of eDNA metabarcoding for biodiversity surveys, compared to earlier mentioned methods, is that it enables efficient and non-invasive species detection with relatively small effort (and continuously decreasing price), even for large scale surveys 12,  14. eDNA metabarcoding is now widely applied to various terrestrial and aquatic samples, both ancient and modern, showing great potential for use in biodiversity monitoring and ecological studies 10,  11,  13.
2: For example, specific ecological applications include verifying species presence and potential range expansion 15,  16, uncovering drivers of community composition 17,  18 and estimating species richness and diversity 10,  19,  20.
3: In addition, the method has proven highly useful for diet analysis 21,  22 and derived applications such as unravelling food webs 23  25, predatorprey interactions 18,  26, herbivore ecosystem function 14,  27 and niche breadth 28,  29.
