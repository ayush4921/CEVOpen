0: Anthropogenic influences on ecosystems are currently causing devastating changes and we are now observing increased rates of species extinction, loss of biodiversity and, as a consequence, loss of ecosystem functioning 1.
1: Thus, rapid, habitat-specific and non-invasive biodiversity assessments are urgently needed 2.
2: Biodiversity has been assessed, at varying geographic scales, by a variety of methods such as flight trapping, pitfall traps 3, acoustic surveys 4, camera traps 5 and field observations 6.
3: While these methods have been designed for application to specific environments, study systems, and species, they have several drawbacks and limitations.
4: For example, approaches based on visual observation and acoustic detection are highly dependent on the identification skills of the operator 7.
5: Additional challenges are constituted by biases in overall species occurrence, seasonality, behaviour and changes in community composition due to alternation in species distribution (e.g.
6: sink or marginal areas) or to environmental fluctuations (e.g.
7: temporal ponds, succession stages) 8.
8: Physical survey methods (e.g.
9: trapping) are invasive, and therefore often not applicable when dealing with species of conservation concern.
10: Furthermore, conventional methods (as described above) are constrained by a species behaviour and body size, and are highly time consuming 9.
11: As a consequence, biodiversity survey techniques that are less dependent on direct behavioural observations, and are less invasive have gained increasing interest 10,  11.
