0: With this in mind, we empirically evaluate if, and to what extent, eDNA metabarcoding analysis of faecal samples from generalist predators collected non-invasively can be used as a tool for characterising and monitoring the biodiversity at a particular study site.
1: To do this, we focus on two predatory generalist omnivore species, the Eurasian badger ( Meles meles) and the red fox ( Vulpes vulpes) in a protected area in Denmark, for which a comprehensive species inventory list is available, providing an overview on the areas long-term biodiversity.
2: Specifically, we: i) use eDNA metabarcoding on non-invasively collected faecal samples to assess the diet of the two omnivorous predatory species by applying universal markers covering the plant, vertebrate and invertebrate components of the diet, ii) assess the effect of environmental exposure (faecal age since deposition) on eDNA metabarcoding detection efficiency, iii) compare eDNA metabarcoding results to macroscopic diet assessment, iv) compare the list of prey species detected in the diet by eDNA and macroscopic identification techniques to the comprehensive species list achieved by traditional field observations.
