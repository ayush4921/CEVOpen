<p id="Par19">eDNA metabarcoding using the three universal markers generated a total of 15,176,073 paired-end sequence reads for which markers and tags could be identified. Our sequence analysis and filtering pipeline discarded 4 (4%) badgers and 1 (1.5%) fox samples (final number of 95 and 71 samples available for dietary analysis, respectively). Number of badger and fox reads varied among samples (mean = 5409, SD = 4822). These reads were used to confirm predator identity. Among the 71 fox samples, we identified 15 samples that contained 
 <italic>Martes</italic>. After applying the filtering pipeline, 13 of these samples did not contain any fox reads, ultimately supporting the assumption that they might be faeces deposited by marten rather than fox. The remaining two samples with marten sequences contained both fox and marten, and their origin could not be ascertained. These two samples were excluded from further analyses. Among the 95 badger samples, we identified one that contained 
 <italic>Vulpes</italic> sequences and no badger sequences. This sample was included in the analysis for the fox, with a final dataset of 57 fox samples available for analysis. Due to low sample size, we excluded the 13 marten samples from statistical analysis of diet comparison, but reported on the composition of these samples separately, and included the dietary information in the analysis of applicability of dietary approaches in biodiversity assessment.
