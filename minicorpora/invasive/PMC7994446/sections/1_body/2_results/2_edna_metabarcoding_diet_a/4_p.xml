<p id="Par22">To assess the general composition of badger and fox diet, we calculated the proportion of samples that contained prey components detected with one, two or three universal markers (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C). Fox samples more commonly (56% 
 <italic>vs.</italic> 32%) contained all three food categories, whereas an exclusively plant-based composition was found only in badger faeces (11%). These differences were additionally supported by the NMDS results (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) that, despite a considerable overlap, showed a significant dietary differentiation between the two predators (d.f. = 1, F = 8.71, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.01). For this analysis, we had to exclude the outlier fox sample that contained 
 <italic>Anseriformes,</italic> which was masking the overall interpretation of dietary variation between badger and fox.
