<p id="Par24">Among the 13 marten samples, 40%, 33% and 27% of all sequences were attributed to plant, invertebrate and vertebrate diet components, respectively (note that blocking primers for 
 <italic>Martes</italic> where not employed, which most likely affected detection efficiency of vertebrates). We found an average of 6 sequences per sample, although with large variation (i.e. 2 samples with 12 and 13 sequences, and a few samples with only 2 sequences). Overall, 35% of those sequences were identified to species level, 26% to genus, 24% to family, and finally, 6% to order, and 9% to higher taxonomic levels (Supplementary Table
