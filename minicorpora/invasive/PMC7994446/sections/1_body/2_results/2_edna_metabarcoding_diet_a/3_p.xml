<p id="Par21">The number of different taxa identified per sample, derived by pooling multiple sequences identified to the same taxa within each sample, differed between markers and was greater for plants in both predators (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). Multiple different plant taxa were found in scats from both predators, while the invertebrate and vertebrate components of the diet were less diverse. Within the plant-based components of the diet, the sequences assigned to the orders 
 <italic>Fagales</italic>, 
 <italic>Poales</italic>, 
 <italic>Rosales</italic> and 
 <italic>Caryophylales</italic> had the highest FO in scats from both badger and fox (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Concerning the vertebrate diet components, 
 <italic>Artiodactyla</italic> had high FO (mostly in fox diet). Among taxa identified with the invertebrate marker, 
 <italic>Coleoptera</italic> were most frequently consumed by badger, while 
 <italic>Lepidoptera</italic> were mostly found in fox diet (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Most diet components occurred with a low frequency, but with some noticeable differences between the two predators (e.g. 
 <italic>Quercus</italic> 16% FO in the badger and only 2% in the fox, and 
 <italic>Sus scrofa</italic> with FO 39% in fox and only 3% in badger), and with some taxon exclusively detected in scats of one predator (e.g. 
 <italic>Anseriformes</italic> which occurred only in one fox sample).
