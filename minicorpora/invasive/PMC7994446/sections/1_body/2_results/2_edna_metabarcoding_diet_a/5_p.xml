<p id="Par23">Using badger samples (N = 95), we found no significant effect of faecal age on the number of taxa detected per sample (F
 <sub>1,169</sub> = 0.033, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.855, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A), or on the number of reads obtained per sample (F
 <sub>1,169</sub> = 0.019, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.913, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). A significant effect of the marker was found in both analyses (number of taxa: F
 <sub>2,169</sub> = 9.06, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; number of reads: F
 <sub>2,169</sub> = 9.60, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), but no interaction effect. An analysis of the taxonomic resolution of sequences assignation likewise did not indicate any effect of sample age (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.5 for all comparisons between the two age categories), although species level identifications increased 14% for invertebrates when fresher samples were used (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C, d.f. = 1, X
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.29, 95% CI = − 0.23–0.52,
