<p id="Par20">We identified 91 and 87 plant, 14 and 17 vertebrate, and 53 and 29 invertebrate sequences in badger and fox samples, respectively (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). Sequences were identified to taxa at different taxonomic levels (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>), and the taxonomic resolution of the three universal markers differed considerably. Taxonomic resolution was higher for vertebrates (33% and 43% of sequences identified to species level) compared to plants (7% and 8%) and invertebrates (20% and 13%) in badger and fox samples, respectively. Using the invertebrate marker, 32% of the sequences in badger, and 18% fox samples were only identified to taxonomic levels higher than order.
