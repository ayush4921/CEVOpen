<p id="Par18">From April to December 2015, we collected 99 faecal samples for badger, and 72 for fox in Lille Vildmose, Denmark. Samples were approximately evenly distributed among seasons, with a slight overrepresentation during winter, particularly for fox. Overall, badger faecal samples tended to be geographically clustered due to the use of latrines located close to the setts, whereas fox samples were more randomly distributed in the area.</p>
