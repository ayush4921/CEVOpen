    "<h4>Simple Summary</h4> In California, grape cultivation for wine, juice, fresh and raisin markets is one of the most profitable agricultural sectors. Pathogens, weeds and insect pests cause millions in crop loss and result in additional costs through the use of pesticides and other control tools. Here, we report on the emergence of a new California grape pest, the carpentermoth Givira ethela (Neumoegen and Dyar, 1893). This paper also aimed at the moth’s identification through molecular and morphological features and updates the distribution of G. ethela in California. Furthermore, the presence of G. ethela larval galleries appears to facilitate the mealybug pest Planococcus ficus Signoret, 1875, providing better access to vine sap and protection from natural enemies, environmental stresses, and pesticide treatments. We propose that management practices against G. ethela should include the correct identification of the pest and of its damage, but also the investigation of monitoring methods, economic thresholds, biological controls, and a better understanding of the relationship between G. ethela and P. ficus or other mealybug pest species. <h4>Abstract</h4> Grape cultivation is a billion-dollar agricultural sector in California, where invasive or novel pest species can disrupt management practices. We report herein on a new pest associated with California vineyards, the carpentermoth Givira ethela (Neumoegen and Dyar, 1893). Rather than an invasive species, G. ethela appears to be a newly recognized wood-boring pest of Vitis vinifera (L.) in regions of California’s Central Valley, where its initial occurrence has been dated back to, at least, the beginning of the 2000s. The habitus of adult, genitalia and pupa is illustrated. Givira ethela distribution in California is updated including published records and new data. Carpentermoth galleries seem to facilitate the access of Planococcus ficus Signoret, 1875 to vine sap and protection from natural enemies, environmental stresses, and pesticide treatments. Notes on pest status, life history, monitoring practices, natural enemies, and management options on grapes are also discussed. Tools for the Integrated Pest Management of G. ethela should include the correct identification of the insect and its damage, a full understanding of its biology and ecology, the application of monitoring methods, and the identification of economic thresholds and injury levels."
