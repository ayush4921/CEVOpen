0: The most severe but rarely reported impact of transportation infrastructure is the destruction and loss of natural ecosystems [ 28].
1: Ecosystem destruction is the absolute loss of habitat surface area through the physical presence of a road or railway and related facilities that can take up a substantial amount of space [ 20].
2: The construction of transportation infrastructure often results in land use conversion, from natural ecosystems such as forests and water bodies, to transportation land use or right-of-way [ 21,  29].
3: This entails clearing of vegetation and the accompanying levelling operations that destroy the original topography and soil profile.
4: It further entails the elimination, replacement or modification of the original characteristics of natural vegetation and aquatic ecosystems [ 20,  21].
