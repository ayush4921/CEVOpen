0: The rapidly expanding transportation infrastructure can impact the environment both directly, as an immediate consequence of the presence of the infrastructure and its construction or indirectly, as a result of human activities that are facilitated by new infrastructure [ 13].
1: An analysis of the impacts of 33 planned and existing development corridors, including transportation infrastructure in sub-Saharan Africa showed that ecosystems have been significantly impacted by increasing land-use pressure and encroachment that has in part been triggered by the infrastructure development [ 13].
2: Other studies have established that transportation infrastructure leads to loss of ecosystem integrity through truncation of ecosystems into smaller, often isolated, patches that may not be able to maintain or sustain ecological processes in the long run [ 16].
3: Such impacts include bisection of watersheds and basins; physical disturbance and disruption to the composition, structure and functioning of ecosystems, and movement, migration and survival of resident wildlife species [ 13,  14,  17]; direct mortality of wildlife through vehicle/trainwildlife collisions (V/TWC) [ 10,  16,  18], and behavioural modification among diverse species in different ways [ 19].
4: Furthermore, it is argued that transportation infrastructure contributes to soil, water and air pollution [ 20]; alteration of natural processes including natural hydrology, fire regimes and competitor and predator-prey relationships among other impacts [ 21 25].
5: According to Hulme [ 26] and Catford  et al.
6: [ 27], transport infrastructure may act as migration corridors for the natural dispersal of non-native biodiversity by allowing their movement across physical and environmental barriers or by supplying suitable habitat for their expansion.
