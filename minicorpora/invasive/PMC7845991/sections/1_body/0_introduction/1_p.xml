<p>The contribution of transportation infrastructure to economic, social and cultural growth through regional and global integration has had mixed outcomes [

 <xref rid="pone.0246248.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. There has been unprecedented growth and expansion of transportation infrastructure, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, accounting for up to 90% of new infrastructure including but not limited to railways, roads and power lines [

 <xref rid="pone.0246248.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Recently, many African governments have increasingly favoured railways due to their economic and environmental advantages [
 <xref rid="pone.0246248.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Since their inception, railway technology has evolved considerably and reduced transportation costs and increased safety not only for passengers, railway workers and freight but also for the human populations living within the railway corridors [
 <xref rid="pone.0246248.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0246248.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Despite the advantages, and the need to meet the increasing demand for environmental accountability, there is a growing recognition of their impacts on the natural environment, especially in remote and fragile ecosystems characterized by low human population, poor and marginalized communities and marginal or changing climatic conditions. Furthermore, although railways may share impacts with other anthropogenic activities, they have unique impacts associated with their linear form constituting “disturbance corridors” that disrupt the natural, more homogeneous landscape [
 <xref rid="pone.0246248.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>: 157]. Consequently, new calls are emerging to identify, quantify and mitigate the impacts of railways and other transportation infrastructure [
 <xref rid="pone.0246248.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0246248.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0246248.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The potential ecological impacts of the railways can be captured through stakeholder perceptions, and that insight used to inform on ecologically sensitive design, implementation, and mitigation of linear infrastructure impacts.
