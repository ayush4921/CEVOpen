These impacts would normally be identified and effective mitigation measures put in place during and after the construction of the SGR through Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA). During this study, we confirmed that ESIA for the two phases of the SGR were conducted and final reports written to facilitate licencing by the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA), the government regulator [
