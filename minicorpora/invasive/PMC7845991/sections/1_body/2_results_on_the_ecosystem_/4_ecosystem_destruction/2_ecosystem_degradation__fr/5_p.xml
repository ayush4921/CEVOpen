<p>The introduction and spread of invasive plant species due to the recent large scale expansion of the transportation infrastructure have become a major global concern [

 <xref rid="pone.0246248.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. As suggested by Hulme [

 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pone.0246248.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], railway infrastructure can act as a corridor for the natural dispersal of non-native plant species as was observed in different locations along the SGR corridor. Studies across Africa, US and Europe have shown that railway verges and embankments host a high diversity of non-native species [

 <xref rid="pone.0246248.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In most cases, railway verges are regularly mowed or cleared resulting in open spaces suitable for invasive species [

 <xref rid="pone.0246248.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. This creation of new habitats opens up new niches that can be exploited by invasive plant species that can migrate quickly along the linear infrastructure. Early detection through consultations with local communities and stakeholders can offer opportunities for effective management and eradication.
