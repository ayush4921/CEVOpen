<p>Ecosystem fragmentation emerged as the second dominant theme from our consultative meetings. The SGR traversed key ecosystems and resources creating a barrier to the movement of terrestrial animals and reducing sizes of some ecosystems and resources. Participants in the meetings raised concerns that “
 <italic>the infrastructure [had] also been seen to affect wildlife movements</italic>, 
 <italic>for example with animals congregating along the highway”</italic>. To mitigate this the SGR contractors provided underpasses and bridges to allow wildlife to move freely. However, local communities have settled within these underpasses and under bridges. During this study, illegal settlements were observed along the SGR section bisecting Tsavo East and West National parks, further blocking wildlife movement across the SGR. This was further reinforced by meeting participants who observed that “a 
 <italic>lot of underpasses have been blocked by the proliferation of illegal settlements and the conversion of land to agriculture”</italic>. Due to the sustained construction activities along the SGR and its use, most animals, especially elephants were observed to have changed their behaviour and responses as observed by one local leader that “
 <italic>some animals such as elephants have become more aggressive as they interpret traffic noise as an indicator of the presence of humans and consequently appear to be on the defensive”</italic>. One of the consequences of the barrier effect is the emergence and intensification of human-wildlife conflicts (HWC) as animals move away from railways and roads to surrounding communities, thereby reducing the buffer between wildlife areas and human communities. Supporting this observation, some respondents confirmed that “
 <italic>there had been an observed increase in human-wildlife conflict which may not necessarily be attributed to the SGR”</italic>.
