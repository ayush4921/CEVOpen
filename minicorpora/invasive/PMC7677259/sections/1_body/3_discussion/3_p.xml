<p>We found 
 <italic>P. operculella</italic> pupal weight, larval, and pupal developmental time were significantly affected by the solanaceous host species. In general, larval and pupal development time are the most important parameters to assess a host plantâ€™s suitability to a phytophagous insect (
 <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Awmack and Leather, 2002</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Saeed et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Horgan et al., 2012</xref>). Here, larval and pupal developmental time were longest on potato and shortest on tomato and wolfberry. Pupal weight was greatest on potato and least on wolfberry, and larval survival rate was highest on potato and lowest on wolfberry. Previous studies have generally suggested that insects have a high survival rate and faster development time on their preferred host plants (

 <xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">Sylla et al., 2019</xref>). Inconsistently, our data showed high survival rate but long, not short, larval developmental time for 
 <italic>P. operculella</italic> on their primary hosts, potato and tobacco. Moreover, there were also significant differences in the pupal weight between males and females on tomato, 
 <italic>P. alkekengi</italic>, datura, and wolfberry. These results suggest that plant quality of these unfavorable hosts negatively affects males more than females, especially for pupal weight of the potato tuberworm.
