<p>Our results have important implications for understanding the phytochemical and physiological mechanisms of potato and tobacco as the best hosts of potato tuberworm and predicting the population dynamics of invasive pest species. Differences in ovipositional preference and the development performance of potato tuberworm depend significantly on plant nutrition and defensive chemicals among the seven tested host plants. This study can help us to better understand the effect of potato tuberworm on Solanaceae crops in invaded areas. We predict potato tuber moth may only outbreak in potato and tobacco growing areas, attacking potato and tobacco. Such effects can be due to high plant nutrition and low defensive chemicals in these two primary hosts. In areas, where there are only its new but minor hosts, e.g., 
 <italic>S. melongena</italic>, 
 <italic>P. alkekengi</italic>, and 
 <italic>L. barbarum</italic>, the insect will perform poorly due to low plant nutrition and high defensive chemicals in these hosts.
