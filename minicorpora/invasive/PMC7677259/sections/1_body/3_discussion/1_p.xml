<p>In this study, we examined host use by potato tuberworm from the perspective of plant nutrition and defensive chemicals, by describing the oviposition preference and development performance of this pest on seven solanaceous plants. We found that the number of eggs and larval survival were higher on potato and tobacco plants, which had higher soluble protein and lower total phenolics, while the reverse was true for tomato, datura, and wolfberry. Our results show a plant chemical-dependent host use pattern for this pest species, which will help us to predict the population dynamics of potato tuberworm on these and future new host plants in its invaded ranges.</p>
