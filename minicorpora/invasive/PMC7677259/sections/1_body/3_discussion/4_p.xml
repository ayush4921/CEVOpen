<p>Many studies have suggested that primary chemical compounds involved in plant physiological processes potentially alter developmental performance, reproductive capacity, and morphological characteristics of phytophagous insects (

 <italic>N. tabacum</italic> could be due to high plant nutrition resources (i.e., C content and soluble protein) available to potato tuberworm in their host plants. Indeed, several studies have reported that plant carbon-based nutrients (i.e., sterols and carbohydrates) can positively influence insect performance (
