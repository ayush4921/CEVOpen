<p>The number of eggs laid (on leaves, soil, or the cage netting) was significantly affected by the host plant species in no-choice experiments (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The highest number of eggs was laid on leaves of 
 <italic>N. tabacum</italic> and the lowest number of eggs was laid on leaves of 
 <italic>L. barbarum</italic> (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The number of eggs in the soil around 
 <italic>S. tuberosum</italic> was the largest and the number of eggs in the soil around 
 <italic>L. barbarum</italic> was the lowest (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The greatest number of eggs that were laid on the nylon netting occurred with 
 <italic>L. barbarum</italic> and the fewest with 
 <italic>N. tabacum</italic> (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). However, there was no significant difference in the total number of eggs of three ovipositional sites among seven tested plants (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, ovipositional preference, as determined by the total number of eggs laid on the plant leaf and the soil around the plant, was also significantly influenced by plant species (F

 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The adult tuber moths were most likely to lay eggs on 
 <italic>S. tuberosum</italic> and least likely to do so on 
 <italic>L. barbarum</italic> (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).
