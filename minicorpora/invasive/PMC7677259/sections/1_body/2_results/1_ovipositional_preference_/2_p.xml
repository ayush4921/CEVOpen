<p>There was a significant effect of host plant species on larval developmental time, pupal developmental time, and pupal weight, and only pupal weight was significantly affected by insect sex. However, there was no significant influence of interactions of host plants and sex on insect performance (

 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The longest and shortest larval developmental time were observed on 
 <italic>S. tuberosum</italic> and 
 <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic>, respectively (
