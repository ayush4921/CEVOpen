0: Biological invasions threaten global economic development and ecological and food security, especially when invasive pest species cause loss of crop yields ( Huber et al., 2002;  Pimentel et al., 2005;  Worner and Gevrey, 2006).
1: The introduction, establishment, and colonization of alien insect species are determined by many factors, for example, host availability and food quality ( Burrack et al., 2013;  Kenis et al., 2016;  Cowie et al., 2019).
2: In such invasive processes, host plant species can significantly influence adult oviposition preference and larval developmental performance of phytophagous insect ( Abbes et al., 2016).
3: Moreover, invasive pest insects are usually distributed in areas with different plant hosts, likely leading to differences in the insect population densities ( Nylin et al., 2014).
4: Therefore, estimating the preference and performance of invasive pest insects on various host plants could help predict their population dynamics and damage potential in invaded areas.
