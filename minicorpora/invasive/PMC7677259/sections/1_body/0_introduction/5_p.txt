0: In this study, we ask the following questions: (1) what are the differences in performance and preference of  P. operculella among native and novel host plants?
1: and (2) does host chemistry lead to a difference in the larval performance of  P. operculella?
2: To answer these questions, we examined the oviposition preference of adult tuber moth and the larval developmental characteristics on seven solanaceous plants.
3: We then evaluated the relationship between the phytochemistry and insect performance by determining primary and secondary metabolisms in our test plant species.
