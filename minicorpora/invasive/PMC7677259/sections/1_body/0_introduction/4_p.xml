<p>The performance of potato tuberworm larvae may be strongly influenced by host plant chemistry. 
 <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Pacifico et al. (2019)</xref> found that α-chaconine and caffeic acid in potato tuber skin significantly affected its larval survival. Tomato fruit biochemical (α-tomatine) and physical (fruits size and maturity) properties may also impact the growth, development, and survival of 
 <italic>P. operculella</italic> larvae (
 <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">Mulatu et al., 2006</xref>). Study of the effects of four host plants and two nonhost plants on the behavior of newly hatched larvae of 
 <italic>P. operculella</italic> (
 <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">Varela and Bernays, 1988</xref>) showed that leaf surface extracts might affect larval hatch rates from soil-laid eggs and subsequent larval dispersal onto plants. Plant odors may also important in mediating host plant location and ovipositional selection by adult tuber moth (
 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Fenemore, 1988</xref>). Although many previous studies have addressed the importance of plant chemistry in determining 
 <italic>P. operculella</italic> performance, it is still not clear how primary metabolism and defensive chemicals of host plants affect its host preference and performance and then promote its invasiveness.
