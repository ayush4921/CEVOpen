0: Plant primary and secondary metabolisms determine host plant quality and potentially influence feeding performance and life history traits of phytophagous insect.
1: Many studies suggest that high concentrations of defensive chemicals (i.e., alkaloids, glucosinolates, terpenoids, and phenolics) with toxic, antifeedant, or repellent properties can significantly reduce insect performance ( Bezemer et al., 2004;  Mumm et al., 2008;  Yan et al., 2018;  Fuchs et al., 2020), while relatively high amounts of nitrogen are beneficial for insect development ( Awmack and Leather, 2002).
2: In addition, plant structural components of cell walls, cellulose and lignin, play essential roles in plant defenses as constitutive barriers.
3: For instance, plant cellulose content can effectively predict plant defense traits (i.e., leaf toughness) and is negatively associated with some types of insect feeding, such as leaf miners ( Kitajima et al., 2012;  Fuentealba et al., 2020).
4: Therefore, understanding of how these phytochemicals affect invasive insect performance is critical in predicting invasive insect invasiveness.
