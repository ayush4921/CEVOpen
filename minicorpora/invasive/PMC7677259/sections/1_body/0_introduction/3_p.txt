0: Potato tuberworm,  Phthorimaea operculella (Zeller; Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae), is an important invasive insect originating in South America.
1: It attacks many solanaceous crops and wild plants such as potato ( S. tuberosum), tobacco ( N. tabacum), tomato ( S. lycopersicum), eggplant ( S. melongena), datura ( D. stramonium), wolfberry ( L. barbarum), and the genera  Physalis in temperate and subtropical regions ( Rondon, 2010).
2: Solanum tuberosum,  N. tabacum,  D. stramonium, and  S. lycopersicum are native hosts for this insect, while the others are new hosts of the insect in the invaded areas, i.e.,  S. melongena,  P. alkekengi, and  L. barbarum are native to Asia.
3: Adults of potato tuberworm lay eggs in foliage, exposed tubers, or soil surrounding host plants.
4: Larvae mine leaves, petioles, stems, and exposed tubers in the field.
5: With the increase in global warming, the potato tuberworm has invaded more than 90 countries because of its temperature dependence and a high adaptability to diverse conditions ( Rondon, 2010;  Kroschel and Schaub, 2013).
6: Furthermore, the accelerated invasion of potato tuberworm might also depend on broad host range and is closely related to the larval developmental performance on multiple hosts ( Kroschel and Schaub, 2013).
7: Thus, it is important to determine the effects of different host plants on the performance of potato tuberworm, which in turn should improve the integrated management of this pest.
