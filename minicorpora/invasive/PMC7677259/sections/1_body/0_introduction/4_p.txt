0: The performance of potato tuberworm larvae may be strongly influenced by host plant chemistry.
1: Pacifico et al.
2: (2019) found that -chaconine and caffeic acid in potato tuber skin significantly affected its larval survival.
3: Tomato fruit biochemical (-tomatine) and physical (fruits size and maturity) properties may also impact the growth, development, and survival of  P. operculella larvae ( Mulatu et al., 2006).
4: Study of the effects of four host plants and two nonhost plants on the behavior of newly hatched larvae of  P. operculella ( Varela and Bernays, 1988) showed that leaf surface extracts might affect larval hatch rates from soil-laid eggs and subsequent larval dispersal onto plants.
5: Plant odors may also important in mediating host plant location and ovipositional selection by adult tuber moth ( Fenemore, 1988).
6: Although many previous studies have addressed the importance of plant chemistry in determining  P. operculella performance, it is still not clear how primary metabolism and defensive chemicals of host plants affect its host preference and performance and then promote its invasiveness.
