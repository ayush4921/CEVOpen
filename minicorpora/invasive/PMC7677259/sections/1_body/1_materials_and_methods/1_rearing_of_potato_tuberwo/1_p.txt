0: We obtained larvae of potato tuberworms from potato fields in Xuanwei City (Yunnan Province, China).
1: They were brought back to the laboratory and reared on potato tubers in wooden cages (40  40  40 cm) held at 27  2C, 7080% RH and a 12:12 h L:D photoperiod.
2: They pupated in sand in the cages.
3: After adults emerged, we collected 50 pairs of adults and placed them for mating and oviposition in plastic containers (height: 25 cm and diameter: 20 cm) with 10% honey water and provided with filter paper as the oviposition substrate ( Wang et al., 2020).
4: Eggs were placed in zip-lock bags and hatched in above experimental conditions.
5: Newly hatched larvae (within 12 h) were used in our study.
