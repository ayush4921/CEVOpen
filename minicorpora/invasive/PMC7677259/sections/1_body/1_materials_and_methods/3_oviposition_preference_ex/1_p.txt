0: To test the ovipositional preference of  P. operculella adults, the seven selected solanaceous plants were individually evaluated in no-choice tests.
1: Experiments were performed in nylon cages (20 cm diameter and 80 cm height) containing one single plant.
2: We exposed two pairs of adult moths to each host plant, allowing them to mate and lay eggs freely, and provided them with 10% honey solution.
3: Four days later, we counted the number of eggs laid in plant leaves and nylon cage using a magnifier.
4: For the number of eggs in the soil around the plant, we first collected 1-cm-deep potted soil and put them in Petri dishes (diameter: 15 cm).
5: We then determined the number of eggs under a light microscope using the methodology suggested by  Karlsson (2009).
6: Each cage was considered as one replicate, and there were 10 replicates per host plant.
