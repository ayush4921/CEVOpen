4: All seed plants were planted in growing medium (half field soil and half sphagnum peat moss) for germination and initial growth in an open-sided greenhouse with natural temperature and light.
5: After 2 weeks of growth, similarly sized seedlings were selected from each species to transplant individually into pots (height: 18 cm and diameter: 24 cm) filled with a mixture of half field soil and half sphagnum peat moss.
6: For potato plants, tubers were cut into about 25 g pieces, each with an eye bud, and then planted 8 cm deep into pots of the same size and soil as above.
7: All plants were covered with fabric (nylon netting) in a greenhouse (10  5  2 m) at Henan University, Kaifeng, China (3449'N, 11418'E).
8: Plants were not fertilized but watered as necessary.
