0: To measure the developmental performance of  P. operculella larvae on plants, we placed five newly hatched larvae on the upper surface of five leaves of each solanaceous plant using a soft brush, until larvae were situated on the leaves.
1: Each leaf was covered with a small nylon bag (15 cm long and 10 cm wide) to prevent the larvae from moving or falling.
2: In this experiment, each plant was used as one replicate, with 10 replicates per plant species.
3: One week after infestation of plants, to prevent the larvae from pupating in the soil, each potted plant was covered with a plastic bag that was sealed at the plant stem.
4: Then each pot was placed inside a larger plastic pot (50 cm diameter and 18 cm height) with 2 cm of sterile sand, which was intended as the larval pupation site.
5: Ten days after initial infestation, we removed bags and examined pupae from the sterile sand daily.
6: All pupae recovered were weighed and placed individually in Petri dishes (5 cm diameter and 1 cm height), lined with tissue paper, and held for adult emergence, which were then sexed.
7: Accordingly, we determined the developmental time of each insect in its larval and pupal stages.
