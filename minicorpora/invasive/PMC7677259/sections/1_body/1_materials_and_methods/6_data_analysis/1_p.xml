<p>Differences in the number of eggs laid, larval survival rate, C and N contents, C:N ratio, levels of soluble sugar, soluble protein, cellulose lignin, and total phenolics among the seven solanaceous plants were analyzed with one-way ANOVA, with 
 <italic>post-hoc</italic> Tukey’s HSD test for multiple comparisons. To assess differences in insect response to host plants and insect sex, we used two-way ANOVAs to analyze larval and pupal developmental time and pupal weight, with host plants and insect sex as the main factors. Then, we used one-way ANOVA, with 
 <italic>post-hoc</italic> Tukey’s HSD test to evaluate the effects of host plants on female and male performance, respectively. An independent-sample 
 <italic>t</italic>-test was performed to test for differences in pupal weight between females and males on each host. Moreover, to estimate the role of plant chemicals in the effects of host plants on the larval survival in the ANOVAs, we performed separate regression analyses to determine the relationships between C content, N content, C:N ratio, levels of soluble sugar, soluble protein, cellulose, lignin, and total phenolics, with larval survival rate. In all analyses, data were checked and satisfied the assumption of normality and homogeneity of variances. We performed all data analyses with software R, version 3.4.2 (
