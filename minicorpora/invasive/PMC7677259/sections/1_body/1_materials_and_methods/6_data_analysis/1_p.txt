0: Differences in the number of eggs laid, larval survival rate, C and N contents, C:N ratio, levels of soluble sugar, soluble protein, cellulose lignin, and total phenolics among the seven solanaceous plants were analyzed with one-way ANOVA, with  post-hoc Tukeys HSD test for multiple comparisons.
1: To assess differences in insect response to host plants and insect sex, we used two-way ANOVAs to analyze larval and pupal developmental time and pupal weight, with host plants and insect sex as the main factors.
2: Then, we used one-way ANOVA, with  post-hoc Tukeys HSD test to evaluate the effects of host plants on female and male performance, respectively.
3: An independent-sample  t-test was performed to test for differences in pupal weight between females and males on each host.
4: Moreover, to estimate the role of plant chemicals in the effects of host plants on the larval survival in the ANOVAs, we performed separate regression analyses to determine the relationships between C content, N content, C:N ratio, levels of soluble sugar, soluble protein, cellulose, lignin, and total phenolics, with larval survival rate.
5: In all analyses, data were checked and satisfied the assumption of normality and homogeneity of variances.
6: We performed all data analyses with software R, version 3.4.2 ( R Development Core Team, 2017).
