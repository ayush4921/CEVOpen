0: Ten randomly selected samples from each plant species were collected and analyzed for the levels of primary and secondary metabolites.
1: Leaves of each healthy plant were cut off and carefully cleaned with water.
2: Then all leaves were dried at 45C for 5 days and ground to powder.
3: The samples were then analyzed for total carbon content (C) and total nitrogen content (N) using an elemental auto-analyzer (Vario MAX CN; Elementar, Hanau, Germany).
4: According to  Elleuch et al.
5: (2007), the soluble sugar content was determined by spectrophotometry (Thermo Scientific GENESYS 10S, Waltham, MA, USA) at 630 nm wavelength.
6: Plant soluble protein levels were determined following  Bradford (1976).
7: Plant cellulose and lignin levels were analyzed by spectrophotometry at 620 and 280 nm wavelengths, following  Updegraff (1969) and  Morrison (1972).
8: Analysis of total phenolics was based on the method of  Ainsworth and Gillespie (2007), using gallic acid as the standard and absorbance determined by spectrophotometer at 765 nm.
