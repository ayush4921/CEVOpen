  <p>Differences in 
   <bold>(A)</bold> larval developmental time, 
   <bold>(B)</bold> pupal developmental time, and 
   <bold>(C)</bold> pupal weights of female and male 
   <italic>Phthorimaea operculella</italic> among seven solanaceous plants. Gray bars indicate females and black bars indicate males. Data are means ± SE. Different letters show significant differences in different host plants (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) based on 
   <italic>post hoc</italic> Tukey’s HSD test, small letters indicate difference in female development performance among host plants, and big letters indicate difference in male development performance among host plants. Asterisks indicate difference in pupa weight between female and male with same host plant.
