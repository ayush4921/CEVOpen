 <caption> Overview of the experimental approach for root decay studies. ( A) Representation of Armillaria ostoyae (pathogenic) and A. cepistipes (saprotroph) used in this study, ( B) The four tissue types sampled for transcriptomics and proteomics analysis, viz., invasive mycelium (growing beneath the outer layer of root), invasive rhizomorphs (emerging out of the roots), non-invasive mycelium and non-invasive rhizomorphs (growing in absence of root). A. ostoyae is shown as an example, ( C) Multidimensional scaling of three biological replicates from each of the tissue types in A. ostoyae for proteomics (left) and transcriptomics (right), ( D) Proportion of transcripts and proteins detected in the two -omics analysis. The blue circle represents the whole proteome, orange depicts the transcripts detected in the RNASeq, and green represents the proteins detected in the proteomics analyses. ( E) The number of differentially expressed genes (blue) and differentially abundant proteins (orange) detected in the two species. </caption>
