  <p>Response towards spruce roots by the mycelia (MvsNIM) of 
   <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> and 
   <italic>A. cepistipes</italic>. (
   <bold>A</bold>) logFC differences of co-orthologs DEG (top) and DAP (bottom) in both species. For proteomics, only genes for which a fold change could be calculated are shown (43 out of 89 orthologs). (
   <bold>B</bold>) Venn diagram showing species-specific and common DEGs in 
   <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> and 
   <italic>A. cepistipes</italic>. Green and red arrows correspond to upregulated and downregulated genes, respectively. Heatmap below shows 779 co-orthologs with similar expression patterns (upregulated/downregulated in both species) out of the 875 common DEGs. Towards right are the top 20 upregulated proteins (red) in the two species, sorted by decreasing logFC in 
   <italic>A. ostoyae</italic>. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Venn diagram showing species-specific and common DAPs in 
   <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> and 
   <italic>A. cepistipes</italic>. Green and red arrows correspond to proteins with increased and decreased abundance, respectively. Heatmap below shows 134 co-orthologs with similar abundance (increased/decreased in both species) out of the 152 common DAPs. Towards right are the top 20 proteins with increased abundance in the two species, sorted by decreasing logFC in 
   <italic>A. ostoyae</italic>.
