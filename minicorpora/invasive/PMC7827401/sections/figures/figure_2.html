 <caption> Enriched GO terms in M vsNIM and R vsNIR of A. ostoyae for transcriptomics ( A) and proteomics ( B). The ratio of number of a particular GO term in a specific comparison (mycelium vs. non-invasive mycelium or in rhizomorphs vs non-invasive rhizomorphs) to the total number of that GO term for a species was used to plot gene ratios for enriched GO terms ( p &lt; 0.05, Fisherâ€™s exact test). The size of the dot is directly proportional to gene ratio, and the color of the dots corresponds to p-values. Grey dots represent GO terms, enriched in only one of the comparisons i.e. either mycelium vs. non-invasive mycelium or rhizomorphs vs. non-invasive rhizomorphs. Enriched GO terms in M vsNIM and R vsNIR of A. cepistipes can be found in Supplementary Figure S4. </caption>
