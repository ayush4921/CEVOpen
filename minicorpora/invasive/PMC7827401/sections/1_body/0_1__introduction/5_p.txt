0: We here employed a comparative multi -omics approach for understanding wood-decay by  Armillaria, a group of wood-colonizing and pathogenic fungi that, in previous comparative genomic studies, showed great potential for improving our understanding of the functional diversity of wood-decay.
1: We allowed a pathogenic ( A. ostoyae) and a saprotrophic ( A. cepistipes) species to colonize Norway spruce ( Picea abies) roots, and performed RNA-Seq and proteomics on invasive mycelium and rhizomorphs and their non-invasive counterparts.
2: We opted for a comparative, instead of a time-series analysis, to enable evolutionary comparisons between two species and emphasize species diversity in  Armillaria.
3: We found that the saprotroph  A. cepistipes showed a stronger response to wood than  A. ostoyae, suggesting adaptations to faster wood colonization in saprotrophs than in pathogens.
4: The two species of  Armillaria displayed a wood-decay profile that, unlike in white-rot fungi, mostly bypasses the activation of LDE encoding genes and is characterized by the upregulation of pectinolytic, cellulolytic, iron acquisition-related and expansin genes.
5: These expression patterns resemble soft-rot, which, however, is selective and based on the transcriptional regulation of genes, given that  Armillaria genomes encode LDE genes.
6: Altogether, the decay profile of  Armillaria highlights a widespread wood-decay strategy in the Agaricomycetes and contributes to unveiling the functional diversity of forest fungi.
