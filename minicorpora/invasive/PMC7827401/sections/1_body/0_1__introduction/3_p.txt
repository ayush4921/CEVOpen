0: Armillaria spp.
1: have immense ability to degrade plant biomass, and thus are ecologically significant for releasing sequestered organic C into the carbon cycle.
2: Previous comparative genomic studies on  Armillaria highlighted plant cell wall degrading enzyme repertoires reminiscent of white-rot fungi [ 15, 17, 18, 19], with a characteristic enrichment of pectinolytic genes [ 17, 19].
3: Accordingly, recent studies treated  Armillaria spp.
4: as white-rot based on the presence of LDE encoding genes in their genomes [ 15, 17, 19, 20, 21].
5: However, previous studies have also shown that  Armillaria species primarily decay the cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin components of the plant cell wall, and leave lignin unattacked during early stages of decay [ 22, 23].
6: Chemical and microscopic analyses of wood decay by  Armillaria produced contradictory results.
7: A. mellea was classified as Group II white-rot fungi which attack celluloses and pentosans at early stages and lignin remains unaffected [ 23].
8: Others reported a type-I soft-rot decay where the fungal hyphae grow through the secondary cell wall layer, producing characteristic cavities in the tracheids, axial, and xylem ray parenchyma cells [ 22].
9: Soft-rot fungi by definition are now restricted to Ascomycota [ 24, 25]; however, there are many Agaricomycetes that produce symptoms resembling soft rot or that do not fit the traditional white rot/brown rot dichotomy [ 7, 8, 20].
10: Soft rot was suggested in  Cylindrobasidium spp., a close relative of  Armillaria, that also has a lower number of LDEs than typical white-rot decayers [ 17, 20].
