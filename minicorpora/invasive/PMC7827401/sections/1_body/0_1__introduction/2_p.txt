0: Armillaria spp.
1: (Basidiomycota, Agaricales, Fungi) are among the most devastating fungal pathogens in woody ecosystems, including temperate forests, tree plantations, vineyards, and gardens [ 9, 10] and are known to cause tremendous losses to the economy, health, and long-term productivity of forests [ 11, 12, 13, 14].
2: The genus  Armillaria comprises about 70 known species [ 15] including both pathogens and saprotrophs, making them suitable for studying mechanisms of pathogenicity and wood-decay systems in fungi [ 11, 14, 15, 16, 17].
