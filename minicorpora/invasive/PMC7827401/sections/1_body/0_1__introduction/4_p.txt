0: White rot fungi remove lignin from wood using high-redox potential oxidoreductases (e.g., class-II peroxidases [ 6, 26]) and degrade complex polysaccharide polymers using diverse glycosyl hydrolase (GH), auxiliary activity (AA), carbohydrate esterase (CE).
1: and polysaccharide lyase (PL) cocktails [ 3, 27].
2: Fungi from multiple white-rot and brown-rot clades have been used to study the wood-decay associated gene expression [ 28, 29, 30, 31, 32].
3: These studies highlighted substrate and species-specific responses, sequential activation of degradative enzymes, along with lifestyle-driven differences among species highlighting the ambiguity of extant decay-type classification.
4: Previous studies on  Armillaria have revealed their unusual gene repertoire [ 15, 17], making them suitable candidates to understand where  Armillaria fits in the ever-growing array of decay types.
