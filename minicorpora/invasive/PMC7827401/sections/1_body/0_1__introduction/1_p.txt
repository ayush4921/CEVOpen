0: Fungi play an immense role in terrestrial ecosystems as decomposers of organic matter, plant pathogens, and mutualistic symbionts.
1: Being the primary decomposers of woody organic matter in forest ecosystems, they contribute substantially towards global carbon cycling by releasing sequestered organic carbon back to the soil.
2: They do so by producing a wide arsenal of plant cell wall degrading enzymes (PCWDEs), which can decay all components of the plant biomass including the recalcitrant lignin, and thus can be used for sustainable utilization of the biomass waste [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
3: Recent fungal -omics studies involving basidiomycetes revealed substantial differences in the plant cell wall degrading enzyme (PCWDE) repertoires of fungi.
4: Genomic patterns align well with fungal lifestyles, including the traditional, broad classification of decay types into either white-rot (complete degradation of plant cell wall components) or brown-rot (lignin remains unmodified or slightly modified) [ 6, 7, 8].
5: However, how finer-scale differences in wood decay gene repertoires translate to functional heterogeneity is not known.
6: Exploring the functional and taxonomic diversity of wood decay fungi could provide opportunities for better understanding of forest ecosystems and for identifying fungal enzymes of biotechnological potential.
