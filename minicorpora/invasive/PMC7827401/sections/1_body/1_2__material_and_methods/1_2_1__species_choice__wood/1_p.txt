0: Armillaria ostoyae is a pathogen while  A. cepistipes is a saprotroph with a mortality ratio not exceeding 5% [ 16, 33].
1: Both of them preferentially colonize conifers [ 16].
2: Cultures of  Armillaria ostoyae C18 and  Armillaria cepistipes B2 [ 17] were inoculated on Malt extract agar (MEA) and incubated at 25 C in dark for a week.
3: Next, 45 cm long, autoclave sterilized spruce ( Picea abies) roots were introduced to the week-old cultures and were kept at 25 C in the dark until the roots were completely colonized by mycelial sheath and rhizomorphs were growing out of the it.
4: Sampling was performed at the time when rhizomorphs were seen emerging out of the roots (23 weeks) ( Figure 1B).
5: After colonization, roots were dissected to collect mycelium and rhizomorphs emerging out of the colonized wood ( Figure 1B).
6: Cultures of  Armillaria without the addition of spruce roots were used as controls.
7: The tissues were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at 80 C till further use.
8: Total RNA was extracted in three biological replicates by homogenizing the tissues using mortar and pestle, followed by processing samples using the Quick-RNA Miniprep kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA), following the manufacturers protocol.
