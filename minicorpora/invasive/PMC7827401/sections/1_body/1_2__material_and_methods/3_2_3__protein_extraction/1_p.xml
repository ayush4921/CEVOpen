<p>For protein extraction, tissues were snap-frozen in liquid N
 <sub>2</sub> and bead beaten (Retsch Mixer Mill MM400) periodically (30 Hz, 2 min), with snap freezing between cycles. Lysis buffer (6 M Guanidine-HCl, 0.1 M Tris-HCl, 50 mM DTT pH 8.6) was added to crushed fungal tissue and bead-beating was repeated. Samples were further disrupted using sonication (MS72 probe, 3 × 10 s), with cooling on ice between sonications. Samples were clarified by centrifugation and supernatants passed through 3 kDa cut-off filters (Millipore) to concentrate and perform buffer exchange into PBS. Protein samples were precipitated with TCA (final 15% 
 <italic>w/v</italic>) and pellets were washed with ice-cold acetone. Protein pellets were resuspended in UT buffer (6 M Urea, 2 M Thiourea, 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 8) and concentrations normalized following Bradford protein assay. Samples were digested according to Moloney et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-microorganisms-09-00149" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and ZipTips (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) were used for sample clean-up. Peptide samples were analyzed using the high mass accuracy Q-Exactive mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific) coupled to a Dionex Ultimate 3000 nanoLC with an EasySpray PepMap C18 column (50 cm × 75 µm). Peptide mixtures were separated as described in Collins et al. [
