0: For protein extraction, tissues were snap-frozen in liquid N 2 and bead beaten (Retsch Mixer Mill MM400) periodically (30 Hz, 2 min), with snap freezing between cycles.
1: Lysis buffer (6 M Guanidine-HCl, 0.1 M Tris-HCl, 50 mM DTT pH 8.6) was added to crushed fungal tissue and bead-beating was repeated.
2: Samples were further disrupted using sonication (MS72 probe, 3  10 s), with cooling on ice between sonications.
3: Samples were clarified by centrifugation and supernatants passed through 3 kDa cut-off filters (Millipore) to concentrate and perform buffer exchange into PBS.
4: Protein samples were precipitated with TCA (final 15%  w/v) and pellets were washed with ice-cold acetone.
5: Protein pellets were resuspended in UT buffer (6 M Urea, 2 M Thiourea, 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 8) and concentrations normalized following Bradford protein assay.
6: Samples were digested according to Moloney et al.
7: [ 34] and ZipTips (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) were used for sample clean-up.
8: Peptide samples were analyzed using the high mass accuracy Q-Exactive mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific) coupled to a Dionex Ultimate 3000 nanoLC with an EasySpray PepMap C18 column (50 cm  75 m).
9: Peptide mixtures were separated as described in Collins et al.
10: [ 35] and resultant data were analyzed using MaxQuant (v 1.5.3.30) [ 36] with the label-free quantitation (LFQ) algorithms and searching against the protein database (filtered models) in JGI MycoCosm [ 17].
