0: Proteomic results were analysed using Perseus (v 1.5.4.0) [ 40].
1: Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed to determine the relative changes in protein abundance.
2: Quantitative analysis was performed using a students t-test with a  p-value cut-off of 0.05 and log 2(fold change; FC)  1.
3: Qualitative analysis revealed proteins that were detected in 2/3 replicates for a sample type and undetectable in all replicates of the comparator group.
4: A theoretical minimum fold change was determined for qualitative results based on a calculated minimum detectable protein intensity (mean + 2 standard deviations of lowest detectable protein intensity for each replicate in the experiment) [ 34].
5: Based on this theoretical minimum fold change, some qualitative results were excluded due to intensity values approaching the minimum detectable levels.
6: Qualitative and quantitative results were combined, and a total number of differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) are summarized in  Supplementary Table S3.
