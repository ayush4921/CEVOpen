0: Transporters were identified by using DeepLoc [ 45] to select plasma membrane-localized proteins from the proteomes of both species.
1: Plasma membrane-localized proteins with >1 transmembrane domains were used to obtain a list of non-redundant InterPro domains, which were manually curated for functional roles in transport.
