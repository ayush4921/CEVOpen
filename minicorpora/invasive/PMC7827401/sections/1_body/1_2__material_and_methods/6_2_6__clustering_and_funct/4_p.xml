<p>Transporters were identified by using DeepLoc [
 <xref rid="B45-microorganisms-09-00149" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] to select plasma membrane-localized proteins from the proteomes of both species. Plasma membrane-localized proteins with &gt;1 transmembrane domains were used to obtain a list of non-redundant InterPro domains, which were manually curated for functional roles in transport.
