<p>Cytochrome P450s have diverse functions across the fungal kingdom, including secondary metabolite production, detoxification, aromatic compound degradation, among others [
 <xref rid="B79-microorganisms-09-00149" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Based on InterPro domains (IPR001128) we found a total of 264 and 307 cytochrome P450 encoding genes in 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> and 
 <italic>A. cepistipes</italic>, respectively. Of these 35 were upregulated and 57 downregulated in invasive mycelia along with three upregulated one downregulated in rhizomorphs of 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> relative to the non-invasive counterparts of these tissues. In proteomics data for 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic>, we found seven increased and seven decreased cytP450s in M
 <italic>vs</italic>NIM, along with three increased and no proteins with decreased abundance in RvsNIR. In 
 <italic>A. cepistipes</italic> we found 58 (proteomics: 13) up- and 84 (6) downregulated cytP450s in M
 <italic>vs</italic>NIM along with 27 (11) up- and 22 (7) downregulated cytP450s in RvsNIR. Most of the cytochrome P450s with increased abundance in invasive mycelia compared to non-invasive were classified as E-class group 1.
