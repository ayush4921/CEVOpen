<p>Interestingly, among the cytochrome P450 proteins that had decreased abundance in invasive mycelia were co-orthologs of the Psi-producing oxygenase A (
 <italic>PpoA</italic>) from 
 <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic>, which is associated with secondary metabolite biosynthesis (sterigmatocystin), oxylipin biosynthesis, and coordination of a/sexual sporulation [
 <xref rid="B80-microorganisms-09-00149" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Ppo proteins are also implicated in virulence, with 
 <italic>A. fumigatus ppo</italic> mutants displaying hypervirulence, possibly due to the activation of the immune response in mammals [
 <xref rid="B81-microorganisms-09-00149" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. This is observed plant pathogens also, with 
 <italic>Fusarium verticillioides ppo</italic> deletion strain showing higher virulence in assays with maize cobs as well as elevated fumonisin production and lower induction of plant defense-related genes [
 <xref rid="B82-microorganisms-09-00149" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Therefore, the downregulation of 
 <italic>PpoA</italic> homologs in invasive mycelia of 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> and 
 <italic>A. cepistipes</italic> may result in lower induction of plant defenses, alteration of secondary metabolism, and enhanced virulence.
