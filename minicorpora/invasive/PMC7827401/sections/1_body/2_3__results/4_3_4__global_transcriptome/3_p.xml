<p>The among-species similarity between sampled tissues was assessed based on 11,630 co-orthologous genes in 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> and 
 <italic>A. cepistipes</italic>, identified by OrthoFinder [
 <xref rid="B41-microorganisms-09-00149" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], out of which transcriptomic and proteomic data cover 10,675 and 2404, co-orthologs, respectively. A surprisingly high correlation was found between the invasive mycelia of 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> and 
 <italic>A. cepistipes</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-microorganisms-09-00149">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>
 <italic>)</italic>, whereas the correlation was comparatively lower in all other combinations. This observation was similar for both transcriptomic and proteomic data and was even more pronounced when we considered only genes/proteins that were DEG or DAP in at least one of the species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-09-00149-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). We interpret the correlated gene expression in 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> and 
 <italic>A. cepistipes</italic> as an indication of a shared response of invasive mycelia to the presence of spruce roots.
