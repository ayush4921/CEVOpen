In previous time-series studies, abundant pectinase expression was found during the early stages of wood-decay, suggesting a requirement of early-stage pectinolytic ‘pretreatment’ [

 <xref rid="B67-microorganisms-09-00149" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], it was also observed that early stages of wood decay were marked by increased expression of expansins and GH28 pectinases, suggesting both enzymatic and mechanical loosening of the plant cell walls for easier access of the cellulose and hemicellulose components. Our observations of pectinolytic PCWDE and expansin expression are in line with this.
