<p>A diverse array of plant cell wall degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) were found to be differentially expressed in the invasive tissues of both species. Overall the number of upregulated PCWDEs in the invasive mycelium was much higher than the invasive rhizomorphs when compared to their non-invasive counterparts (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-09-00149-f005">Figure 5</xref>). The saprotrophic 
 <italic>A. cepistipes</italic> had a higher number of DEG/DAP PCWDEs than the pathogenic 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-09-00149-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Among differentially expressed PCWDEs in mycelium vs non-invasive mycelium, upregulated pectinases were most numerous accounting for 17% and 37% of all pectinases in 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> and 
 <italic>A. cepistipes,</italic> respectively. These were followed by cellulases (9%, 27%), hemicellulases (11%, 30%), and expansins (12%, 10%) (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-microorganisms-09-00149">Supplementary Table S6</xref> for the complete list of differentially expressed PCWDEs). We found most of the LDE related genes to be downregulated in both species, with none upregulated in 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> and few upregulated in 
 <italic>A. cepistipes</italic> (

 <italic>)</italic>. In addition to the general downregulation of LDE encoding genes, four copies of dye decolorizing peroxidases (DyPs) were present in each species, but none of these were detected in the wood-decay transcriptomics and proteomics in 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> and one only downregulated DyP was observed in invasive mycelium of 
 <italic>A. cepistipes</italic>. We found one and eight upregulated LPMOs/AA9 in invasive mycelia of 
 <italic>A. ostoyae</italic> and 
 <italic>A. cepistipes,</italic> respectively, which might act together with the cellobiohydrolases to enhance cellulose degradation [
