<p id="Par20">The overall, natural, and anthropogenic dispersal ability of all alien plant species in the six risk ranks showed an increasing trend from the southeast to the northwest regions of China (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The geographical distribution of dispersal ability of the alien plant species was inversely related to the number and density thereof

 </sup>. The majority of alien plant species with high dispersal ability were distributed in inner areas of the northwest parts of the country; however, the majority of alien plant species with low dispersal ability were distributed in the southeast region. The dispersal ability of alien plant species is considerably dependent on the number and relative importance of each dispersal mode (Supplementary Material 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Most alien plant species present with at least one anthropogenic dispersal mode

 </sup>, although those with a high dispersal ability may possess more natural dispersal modes than those with a low dispersal ability

 </sup>. Therefore, alien plant species distributed in the inner areas of northwest China often present with more dispersal modes than those in the southeast.
