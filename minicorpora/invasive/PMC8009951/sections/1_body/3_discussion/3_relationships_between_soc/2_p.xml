<p id="Par22">This study has an important limitation. Traditionally, researchers have assumed that the diaspore of a plant species uses one dispersal mode that is closely associated to its morphology

 </sup>. This perspective ignores the probability that such diaspores can be dispersed via other dispersal modes. However, the data on the probabilities of this occurrence are unknown for alien plant species in China. Therefore, using the technique of AHP to determine the dispersal ability of the latter by weighting all dispersal modes can reflect a trend in their dispersal ability; however, application of such an approach cannot provide an understanding of the exact mechanism by which such alien plant species cause dispersal of their diaspores.
