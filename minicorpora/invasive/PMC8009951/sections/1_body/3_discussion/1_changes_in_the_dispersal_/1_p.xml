<p id="Par19">Our results showed that the natural dispersal ability of alien plant species in ranks I to VI exhibited a decreasing trend; however, the total and anthropogenic dispersal abilities showed increasing trends (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). These results implied that high-risk alien plant species (i.e., those that resulted in considerable economic and ecological loss) had a higher natural dispersal ability, and low-risk alien plant species (i.e., those that resulted in less or negligible economic and ecological loss) exhibited a lower natural dispersal ability. Possible reasons for this include the fact that high-risk alien plant species rely more on natural dispersal strategies, and rely less on anthropogenic strategies apart from accidental introduction (e.g., speirochory or introduced involuntarily via mixing with grain or fodder)
