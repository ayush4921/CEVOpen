0: In this study, we defined the ability of alien plant species to extend their diaspore dispersal distance as dispersal ability without considering the roles of the number of diaspores dispersed due to lack of data on the latter.
1: To overcome selective pressures arising from both biotic and abiotic factors, plant species rely on multiple dispersal modes to facilitate the spread of their diaspores 14.
2: Diaspore dispersal ability can be used to estimate the dispersal modes used 15; therefore, the dispersal ability of a species is a consequence of a combination of multiple dispersal modes.
3: Using the technique of analytic hierarchy process (AHP), we first assigned a weight to each dispersal strategy and mode based on the dispersal distance they corresponded to by calculating the relative importance of two strategies and modes and by generating a pairwise comparison matrix of the dispersal strategies and modes in each of these (Supplementary Material  2).
4: We then determined the dispersal ability of a species by adding the scores of the multiple dispersal modes used (Supplementary Material  2).
