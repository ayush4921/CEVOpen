<p id="Par15">We conducted regression analyses to determine the influence of socio-climatic factors on diaspore dispersal ability. Parameter fitting of the regressions and analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Duncan’s tests for multiple comparisons of dispersal ability were conducted (with statistical significance as 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 for Duncan’s test) using the software PASW Statistics 18.0 (IBM Inc., Armonk, New York, USA). Histograms of the changes in dispersal ability and the distribution of alien plant species at different risk ranks were illustrated using SigmaPlot 10.0 (Systat Software, Inc., San Jose, California, USA). The software Matlab (MathWorks Inc. Natick, Massachusetts, USA) was used to perform tests using the AHP to determine the dispersal modes and to evaluate the dispersal ability of alien plant species. We used ArcMap 10 (ESRI Inc., Redlands, California, USA) to generate maps illustrating the distribution of the dispersal abilities of the alien plant species and of the different risk ranks observed in 34 provincial-level administrative regions in China.
