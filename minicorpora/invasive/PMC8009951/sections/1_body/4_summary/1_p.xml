<p id="Par23">High-risk alien plant species had a higher natural dispersal ability (or more natural dispersal modes) but a lower anthropogenic dispersal ability (or fewer anthropogenic dispersal modes) than low-risk alien plant species. The dispersal ability of alien plant species increased from the southeast to the northwest regions across China, which was contrary to the geographical distribution of species density. Alien plant species with a high dispersal ability possess more dispersal modes than those with a low dispersal ability. Alien plant species with a low dispersal ability (or fewer dispersal modes) can adapt to mild environments; however, alien plant species with a high dispersal ability (or more dispersal modes) can adapt to harsh environments. Understanding the characteristics of the geographical distribution of the dispersal abilities of alien plant species and invasion strategies adopted to achieve dispersal is essential to enable land managers and policy makers to develop preventive measures for the elimination of natural dispersal routes and for enforcement of laws/policies to control anthropogenic dispersal routes.</p>
