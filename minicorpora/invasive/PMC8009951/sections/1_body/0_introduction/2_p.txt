0: Diaspores of several alien plant species have successfully developed specialized morphological structures for multiple dispersal modes, enabling them to use both biotic and abiotic natural dispersal agents arriving in a new environment 9  13.
1: Dispersal modes are critical determinants of the invasion rate at which alien plant species occupy new habitats 13,  14.
2: Dispersal modes associated with wind, water, animals, and other plants can be categorized as natural strategies (those performed without human involvement) 10,  15  21, while those associated with human activities are categorized as anthropogenic strategies 13,  22,  23.
3: Alien plant species, particularly rapid dispersers, usually use both strategies 14.
