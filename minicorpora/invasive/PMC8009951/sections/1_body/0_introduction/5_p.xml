<p id="Par6">China spans across four precipitation regimes (humid, semi-humid, semi-arid, and arid) from east to west because of its remarkable geographical diversity and continental monsoon climate. From north to south, the country also covers five climatic zones (cold temperate, temperate, warm temperate, subtropical, and tropical)

 </sup>. Additionally, regional population density and the gross domestic product (GDP) tend to decrease from southeast to northwest

 </sup>. Therefore, certain socioeconomic factors associated with population may be closely related to the dispersal ability of alien plant species. Previous studies have shown that the density of alien plant species decreases from the southeast coast to the northwest inland region of China
