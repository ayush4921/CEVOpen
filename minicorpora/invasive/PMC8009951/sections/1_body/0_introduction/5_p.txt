0: China spans across four precipitation regimes (humid, semi-humid, semi-arid, and arid) from east to west because of its remarkable geographical diversity and continental monsoon climate.
1: From north to south, the country also covers five climatic zones (cold temperate, temperate, warm temperate, subtropical, and tropical) 36,  37.
2: Additionally, regional population density and the gross domestic product (GDP) tend to decrease from southeast to northwest 38,  39.
3: Therefore, certain socioeconomic factors associated with population may be closely related to the dispersal ability of alien plant species.
4: Previous studies have shown that the density of alien plant species decreases from the southeast coast to the northwest inland region of China 2,  3,  11,  40  42.
5: Factors influencing this regional distribution pattern of alien plant species density (or richness) can be natural (e.g., precipitation and temperature) and/or anthropogenic (e.g., density of human population, GDP, and GDP per capita) 2,  11,  42.
6: Therefore, both natural and anthropogenic factors should be considered as influencing factors that impact the regional distribution of the dispersal ability of alien plant species.
