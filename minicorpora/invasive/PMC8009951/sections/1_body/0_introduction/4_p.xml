 </sup> have reported that in China, alien plant species are classified into the following six risk ranks, from high- to low-risk, based on their biological traits, scale of possible invasion, and socioeconomic damages caused: I) malignant invaders, II) serious invaders, III) local invaders, IV) mild invaders, V) species requiring further observation, and VI) cultivated alien species. The ability of alien plant species in different risk ranks to extend their dispersal distance is important for invasion control
