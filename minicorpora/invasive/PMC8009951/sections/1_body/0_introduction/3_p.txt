0: The ability of alien plant species to extend their diaspore dispersal distance to the maximum possible extent may be critical to their invasion, survival, and expansion in a new environment 14,  24.
1: Diaspore dispersal distance, which depends on both plant traits and environmental conditions, should therefore be an important variable representing the ability to extend dispersal distance 15,  19,  20,  25  28.
2: However, it is difficult to monitor the dispersal distance of plants via field studies 13,  27,  29, particularly for those that have different dispersal modes, because each mode corresponds to a particular dispersal distance 15,  20,  22,  23,  27,  28.
3: For example, a diaspore can use more than one dispersal mode based on its morphological characteristics.
4: Species that are dispersed by wind (anemochory) can present with the following five types of dispersal modes based on their morphology: 1) chamaechory (an entire round plant that rolls on the ground); 2) cystometeorochory (balloon-like diaspores that glide or roll on the ground); 3) trichometeorochory (diaspores with pappi and that float in the air); 4) pterometeorochory (diaspores with wings and descend in a spiral); and 5) semachory (small diaspores with no special morphology and float in the air) 10,  13,  15,  20,  30.
5: Therefore, the dispersal modea combination of dispersal agents, plant traits, and environmental conditionsrepresents a considerable component of the ability of plants to extend their dispersal distance 15.
