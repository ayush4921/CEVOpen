0: Several ranks of the risk from alien plant species were utilized to meet the requirements of policy makers who were responsible for developing strategies to manage invasive alien plants in China 3,  18,  31  35.
1: Ma et al.
2: 35 have reported that in China, alien plant species are classified into the following six risk ranks, from high- to low-risk, based on their biological traits, scale of possible invasion, and socioeconomic damages caused: I) malignant invaders, II) serious invaders, III) local invaders, IV) mild invaders, V) species requiring further observation, and VI) cultivated alien species.
3: The ability of alien plant species in different risk ranks to extend their dispersal distance is important for invasion control 18.
4: Further studies should also be conducted to assess the dispersal ability of alien plant species that are in different risk ranks and those that use both natural and anthropogenic dispersal agents.
