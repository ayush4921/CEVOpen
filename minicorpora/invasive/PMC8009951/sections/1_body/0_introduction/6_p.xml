<p id="Par7">In this study, we used an inventory, risk ranks, and information of the dispersal modes of alien plant species to examine their dispersal ability, geographical distribution, and the relationship between socio-climatic factors and dispersal ability. Our objectives were to determine the following: 1) the characteristics of alien plant speciesâ€™ dispersal abilities, including those in different risk ranks, 2) the geographical distribution of the dispersal abilities across China, and 3) the relationships between socio-climatic factors and dispersal abilities. The results found based on these objectives might help land managers and policy makers to control alien plant species in China.</p>
