<p id="Par4">The ability of alien plant species to extend their diaspore dispersal distance to the maximum possible extent may be critical to their invasion, survival, and expansion in a new environment

 </sup>. Diaspore dispersal distance, which depends on both plant traits and environmental conditions, should therefore be an important variable representing the ability to extend dispersal distance

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>
 </sup>, particularly for those that have different dispersal modes, because each mode corresponds to a particular dispersal distance

 </sup>. For example, a diaspore can use more than one dispersal mode based on its morphological characteristics. Species that are dispersed by wind (anemochory) can present with the following five types of dispersal modes based on their morphology: 1) chamaechory (an entire round plant that rolls on the ground); 2) cystometeorochory (balloon-like diaspores that glide or roll on the ground); 3) trichometeorochory (diaspores with pappi and that float in the air); 4) pterometeorochory (diaspores with wings and descend in a spiral); and 5) semachory (small diaspores with no special morphology and float in the air)

 </sup>. Therefore, the dispersal mode–a combination of dispersal agents, plant traits, and environmental conditions–represents a considerable component of the ability of plants to extend their dispersal distance
