<p id="Par18">The overall, natural, and anthropogenic dispersal ability of all alien plant species showed significantly negative relationships with GDP–with 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 and 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 for overall and natural dispersal ability, respectively–and MAH (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Natural dispersal ability was positively correlated with MAP (

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and MAT (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) for those in rank III, and MFD (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) for plants in rank V; however, it was negatively correlated with MAH (
