<p id="Par17">The overall, natural, and anthropogenic dispersal ability of all alien plant species showed an increasing trend from southeast to northwest regions of China (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> Ta, Tb, Tc). The variations in dispersal ability (i.e., the differences between the highest and lowest dispersal abilities) for all alien plant species within the 34 administrative regions studied were 3.0%, 1.5%, and 2.7%, respectively, overall and in natural and anthropogenic dispersal modes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> Ta, Tb, Tc). In terms of the risk ranks, the variations in overall dispersal ability were 4.6%, 5.1%, 13.2%, 5.4%, 4.6%, and 3.0% for plants in ranks I, II, III, IV, V, and VI, respectively. The variations in natural dispersal ability were 3.3%, 1.9%, 7.1%, 2.1%, 1.7%, and 1.4%, respectively, for plants in ranks I, II, III, IV, V, and VI. Finally, the variations in anthropogenic dispersal ability were 4.8%, 3.9%, 13.5%, 4.9%, 5.3%, and 2.5% for plants in ranks I, II, III, IV, V, and VI, respectively.
