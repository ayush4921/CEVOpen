<p>The physiochemical characteristics of the rhizosphere soil supporting the growth of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> and the two native species are listed in 
 <xref rid="table-1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The soil parameters supporting only 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> differed from those in which the two native species were growing. Thus, levels of total organic matter, total nitrogen and P, available nitrogen and P, and NO

 <sup>−</sup>-N detected in the rhizosphere soil samples with 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> were significantly (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) higher than those detected in the rhizosphere soil samples from both 
 <italic>A. indica</italic> and 
 <italic>I. cylindrica</italic>. However, total K levels detected in the rhizosphere soil samples from 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> were significantly (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) lower than in rhizosphere soil samples of 
 <italic>A. indica</italic> and 
 <italic>I. cylindrica</italic>. Values for soil pH, total P, available K, and NH

 <sup>+</sup>-N did not differ significantly among all three rhizosphere soils. The moisture content of the soil samples from 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> was higher (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) than that detected in the rhizosphere soil samples of 
 <italic>A. indica</italic> but was the same as that for 
 <italic>I. cylindrica</italic>.
