<p>The expression profiles of genes involved in nitrogen metabolism in the RSM of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> were similar to those in the RSMs of both native plant species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">Fig. 5</xref>). Thus, the read numbers of genes encoding nitrogenase, nitrous oxide reductase, nitrite reductase, nitric oxide reductase, hydroxylamine reductase, hydroxylamine oxygenase, and hydroxylamine monooxygenase in the RSM of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> did not differ substantially from those in either of the two native plant species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">Fig. 5</xref>). One exception was the nitrate reductase encoding gene, whose read number was markedly higher in the 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> RSM.
