<p>The taxonomic relationships of the unigenes identified in the 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> RSM were similar to those identified in the 
 <italic>A. indica</italic> RSM, but differed markedly from those in the 
 <italic>I. cylindrica</italic> RSM. Fungi contributed to most of the total genes expressed in the RSMs of both 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> and 
 <italic>A. indica</italic> at the kingdom level, while those from 
 <italic>Bacteria</italic> and 
 <italic>Archaea</italic> accounted for the majority of the genes expressed in the 
 <italic>I. cylindrica</italic> RSM (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">Fig.Â 4A</xref>). Thus, fungal members from the phyla Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Glomeromycota accounted for the majority of the genes expressed in the RSMs of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> and 
 <italic>A. indica</italic>, while prokaryote members belonging to Proteobacteria, Euryarchaeota, Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Verrucomirobia, and Cyanobacteria were the major contributors in the 
 <italic>I. cylindrica</italic> RSM (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Furthermore, at the gene level, the RSM of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> was closer in composition and relative expression level of unigenes to those in the RSM of 
 <italic>A. indica</italic> than to those in the RSM of 
 <italic>I. cylindrica</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">Fig. 4C</xref>).
