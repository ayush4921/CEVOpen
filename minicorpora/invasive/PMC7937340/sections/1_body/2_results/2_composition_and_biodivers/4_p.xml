<p>As with the bacterial communities, the fungal community of the 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> RSM differed less from that of 
 <italic>A. indica</italic> than from that of 
 <italic>I. cylindrica</italic>. ITS sequences identified from the nine rhizosphere soil samples belonged to members of six fungal phyla. Most were members of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2D</xref>), while the remainder were members of the phyla Glomeromycota, Chytridiomycota, Blastocladiomycota, and Entomophthoromycota. The percentage abundance of Glomeromycota in the RSM of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> was higher (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.05) than that in the RSM of 
 <italic>I. cylindrica</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2D</xref>). However the percentage abundance was not significantly (
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05) different than those of the other phyla detected between the RSM of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> and those of either of the two native species. The identified fungal ITS sequences belonged to 348 genera. Thirty-five were assessed to be relatively abundant, with each accounting for an average of at least 0.5% of the total fungal ITS sequences detected in all the rhizosphere soil samples (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-2">Table S2</xref>). The RSM of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> contained a higher (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.05) percentage abundance of 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> and a lower (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.05) percentage abundances of 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> and 
 <italic>Clavaria</italic> than that of 
 <italic>A. indica,</italic> and a higher (
 <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.05) percentage abundance of 
 <italic>Mortierella</italic>, 
 <italic>Penicilium</italic>, 
 <italic>Cladophialophora</italic>, 
 <italic>Metarhizium</italic>, 
 <italic>Exophiala</italic>, 
 <italic>Nectria</italic>, 
 <italic>Pyrenochaeta</italic>, 
 <italic>Oliveonia</italic>, 
 <italic>Acremonium</italic>, and 
 <italic>Hypomyces</italic> and a lower (
 <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.05) percentage abundance of 
 <italic>Gilophorus</italic>, 
 <italic>Pyrenula</italic>, and 
 <italic>Troposporella</italic> than that of 
 <italic>I. cylindrica</italic> (
