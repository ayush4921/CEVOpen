<p>The composition of the bacterial community in the RSM of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> differed from those in the RSM of the two native species. At the phylum level, the 16S rRNA gene sequences identified from the nine rhizosphere samples belonged to members of 37 divisions and consisted of 34 bacterial phyla. The majority were members of the phyla Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, Gemmatimonadetes, Planctomycetes, Bacteroidetes, and Nitrospirae, where each of their mean percentage abundances in all soil samples were &gt;1.20% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2C</xref>). The 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> RSM contained a higher percentage abundance of members of Proteobacteria (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.05) and Bacteroidetes (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.05) than those of 
 <italic>A. indica</italic> and 
 <italic>I. cylindrica</italic>, and a lower (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.05) percentage abundance of Chloroflexi than that of 
 <italic>I. cylindrica</italic> (
