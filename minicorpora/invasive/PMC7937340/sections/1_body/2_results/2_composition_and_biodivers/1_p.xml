<p>16S rRNA and ITS amplicon sequences (
 <xref rid="table-2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) retrieved from the nine rhizosphere samples of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> and the native species 
 <italic>A. indica</italic> and 
 <italic>I. cylindrica</italic> (three replicas for each) were used to characterize the composition and biodiversity of the bacterial and fungal communities. A total of 46,364 to 66,570 high-quality 16S rRNA sequence reads and 30,659 to 43,822 fungal ITS sequence reads were retrieved from individual samples taken from the nine rhizosphere soil samples. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the sequences retrieved from each of the nine samples belonged to 1,648 and 2,531 bacterial and archaeal OTUs, respectively, and 198 to 665 fungal OTUs, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Figs. 2A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">2B</xref>). Chao1 analyses (
 <xref rid="table-2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) estimated that individually, the RSMs contained 1,860 and 2,842 bacterial and archaeal OTUs, respectively, with a coverage range of 0.98 to 0.99, and 231 to 739 fungal OTUs with a coverage of 0.99, demonstrating that the sequencing depths used in this study covered the diversity of the RSMs from the three plants. Archaeal sequences only accounted for 0â€“0.05% of the 16S rRNA sequences obtained from individual soil sample. They were not investigated further in this study.
