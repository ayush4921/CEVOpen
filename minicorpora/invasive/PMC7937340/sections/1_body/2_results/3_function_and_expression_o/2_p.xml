<p>The expression numbers of the unigenes classified with COG function in each rhizosphere soil sample are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Fig. 3</xref>. Of those with known functions the abundant were: genes encoding polypeptides associated with cell wall, membrane, and envelope biogenesis; signal transduction mechanisms; amino acid transport and metabolism; energy production and conversion; posttranslational modification, protein turnover, and chaperones; carbohydrate transport and metabolism; secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport, and catabolism; and lipid transport and metabolism (an average of between 2,505 and 4,782 genes each for all samples). The genes encoding polypeptides associated with inorganic transport and metabolism, transcription and translation, ribosomal structure, and biogenesis were less abundant (each contributing approximately 2,263 to 2,373 genes).
