<p>Approximately 314 million raw paired-end RNA sequence reads were retrieved from the total rhizosphere soil samples of the three plants. Between 97 and 112 million high-quality reads were retrieved for each of the rhizosphere RNA samples. After the removal of rRNA reads, the rhizosphere soils of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic>, 
 <italic>A. indica</italic>, and 
 <italic>I. cylindrica</italic> contained 6,922,157, 4,263,665, and 3,203,005 cDNA reads, respectively, for ORF prediction. Furthermore, 75,913, 55,826, and 39,458 unigenes were identified in their rhizosphere soils, respectively.
