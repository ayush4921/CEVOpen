<p>The expression levels of functional genes in the RSM of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> differed from those in the RSMs of the two native plant species. Thus, the RSM of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> displayed 1.2 and 3.0 times the expression levels of genes encoding for cell wall, membrane, and envelope biogenesis; 1.6 and 4.8 times those of genes encoding amino acid transport and metabolism; 1.5 and 5.0 times those of genes encoding energy production and conversion; 2.3 and 4.3 times those of genes encoding carbohydrate transport and metabolism; 1.4 and 2.5 times those of genes encoding secondary metabolite biosynthesis, transport, and catabolism; 1.9 and 3.7 times those of genes encoding transcription; 1.4 and 2.3 times those of genes encoding translation, ribosomal structure, and biogenesis; 1.4 and 2.5 times those of genes encoding replication, recombination, and repair; 2.2 and 3.0 times those of genes encoding coenzyme transport and metabolism; and 2.2 and 3.4 times those of genes encoding nucleotide transport and metabolism compared to those of genes expressed in the RSMs of 
 <italic>A. indica</italic> and 
 <italic>I. cylindrica</italic>, respectively (
