<p>Physiochemical analyses of soil samples were carried out according to the protocols described by 
 <xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">Kong et al. (2017)</xref>, with modifications. Briefly, soil mass water content was determined by measuring the percent weight loss after 24 h incubation at 105 °C. Soil organic matter composition was determined using the K
 <sub>2</sub>Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub>-H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> oxidation method (
