0: Physiochemical analyses of soil samples were carried out according to the protocols described by  Kong et al.
1: (2017), with modifications.
2: Briefly, soil mass water content was determined by measuring the percent weight loss after 24 h incubation at 105 C. Soil organic matter composition was determined using the K 2Cr 2O 7-H 2SO 4 oxidation method ( Nelson & Sommers, 1996).
3: Total nitrogen was measured using the Kjeldahl method.
4: Soil inorganic N was extracted with 2 mol KCl, and the concentrations of NO 3-N and NH 4+-N in the KCl extracts were determined using hydrazine sulfate colorimetry and indophenol blue colorimetry, respectively ( Mulvaney, 1996).
5: The total and available phosphorus levels were determined using the colorimetric Moblue-method ( Kuo, 1996), while the total and available potassium levels were measured using the method described by  Helmke & Sparks (1996).
6: The pH values (1:2.5 solution of soil to water) were measured using a pH meter (Mettler-Toledo International Inc., Columbus, OH, USA).
