0: The non-redundant genes obtained from each individual rhizosphere soil sample were matched with KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes,  http://www.genome.jp/kegg/) and orthologies related to nitrogen metabolism (metabolic pathway ko00910), including ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification, were retrieved from the KEGG database using BLASTP (BLAST Version 2.2.31+,  http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) with an e-value threshold of 1 e 5.
1: The number of genes matching individual KEGG orthologies was enumerated.
