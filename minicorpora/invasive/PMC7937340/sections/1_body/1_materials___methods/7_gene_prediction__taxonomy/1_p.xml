<p>Gene prediction, taxonomy, and functional annotation were carried out according to the protocols described by 
 <xref rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. (2019)</xref>. Briefly, open reading frames (ORFs) from each soil sample were predicted using MetaGene (

The predicted ORFs with lengths of more than 100 bp were retrieved and translated to amino acid sequences using the NCBI translation table (

All sequences from gene sets with a 95% sequence identity (90% coverage) were clustered as a non-redundant gene catalog by CD-HIT (

 <sup>−5</sup>. Clustering of orthologous groups (COG) of proteins for ORF annotation was performed using BLASTP against the eggNOG database (v4.5) with an e-value cutoff of 1 e
 <sup>−5</sup>. Unigene expression heatmaps in the different rhizosphere soil samples were constructed using R package software (
