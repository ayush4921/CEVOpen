<p>Sequence quality control and genome assembly were carried out according the protocols described in 
 <xref rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr">Xia et al. (2019b)</xref>. Briefly, we truncated cDNA sequences at the 3′ and 5′ ends using SeqPrep (

Scaffolds over 500 bp were extracted and broken into contigs without gaps. Contigs were used for further gene prediction and annotation.
