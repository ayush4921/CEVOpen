0: RNA extraction, library preparation, and sequencing were conducted according to the methods described by  Xia et al.
1: (2019b) with modifications.
2: Briefly, total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) after grinding the frozen soil samples to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen.
3: Equimolar amounts of RNA extracted from three rhizosphere soil samples from each plant were pooled for transcriptomic analysis to determine the active microbial groups in the RSM and to screen the differentially expressed genes in the RSMs of the different plant species.
4: The quality and quantity of the extracted RNAs were monitored using 1% agarose gel before rRNAs were removed using Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kits (Qiagen) following the manufacturers instructions.
5: For each sample, a library of approximately 200 bp insert sizes was prepared with a TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit (Qiagen), and mRNAs were amplified with a bridge PCR using a HiSeq 3000/4000 Cluster Kit (Illumina, Inc.) according to the manufacturers instructions.
6: The cDNAs obtained were subjected to 2  100 bp paired-end (PE100) sequencing on a HiSeq 2000 instrument using HiSeq 3000/4000 SBS Kits (Illumina, Inc.) on the HiSeq platform of Majorbio Bio-Pharm Technology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China.
7: The raw RNA sequence dataset supporting the conclusions of this article is available in the NCBI Short Reads Archive (SRA) under the submission ID  PRJNA638694.
