0: The ITS2 regions of fungal rRNA were amplified using 2  KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (Shanghai Dobio) and the primers ITS3_KYO2 (GATGAAGAACGYAGYRAA) and ITS4_KYO3 (TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC) ( Toju et al., 2012).
1: The PCR conditions were as follows: an initial denaturation of 15 min at 95 C, followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 95 C, 30 s at either 51 C or 55 C, and 30 s at 72 C, and a final elongation for 5 min at 72 C. The ITS amplicons obtained were then treated and sequenced following the same procedures described earlier for the 16S rRNA gene amplicons.
