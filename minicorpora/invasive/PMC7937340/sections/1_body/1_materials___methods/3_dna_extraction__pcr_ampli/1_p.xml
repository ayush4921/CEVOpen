<p>DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and Illumina sequencing were carried out according to the protocols described by 
 <xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">Kong et al. (2017)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr">Xia et al. (2019a)</xref> with modifications. Briefly, soil DNA was extracted using a PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (Anbiosci, Shenzhen, China) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Crude DNA was purified on 1% (wt/vol) low melting point agarose gel in Tris Acetate-EDTA buffer to obtain genomic DNA. DNA bands were excised, extracted with QIAquick Gel Extraction Kits (Qiagen, Shanghai, China), and then used as templates for PCR amplification. The V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene

  <xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">Turner, Pryer &amp; Miao, 1999</xref>

 <xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">Lane, 1991</xref>) under the following PCR conditions: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min, followed by five cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 10 s, annealing at 55 °C for 15 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s before a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. After cleanup with AMPure XP beads, the 16S rRNA gene amplicons were attached to dual indices and Illumina sequencing adapters using a Nextera XT Index Kit (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) under the following PCR (also prepared with 2 × KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix) conditions: an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s followed by eight cycles of denaturing at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s before a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. The PCR amplifications were carried out in triplicate for each sample, and the PCR products were again cleaned with AMPure XP beads, quantified using an Agilent Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA), normalized, and pooled. These 16S rRNA gene amplicons were then diluted to 4 nM with 10 mM Tris (pH 8.5) before being denatured with NaOH and sequenced (with 5% PhiX as internal control) on a MiSeq IIlumina Platform (PE250) at Genergy Biotechnology (Shanghai, China).
