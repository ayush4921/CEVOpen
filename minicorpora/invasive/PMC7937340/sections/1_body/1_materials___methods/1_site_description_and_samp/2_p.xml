<p>To identify the rhizosphere microbial populations and to determine their roles in the metabolic activities of the RSM of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic>, triplicate soil samples were collected from the rhizospheres of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> in the monoculture zone, 
 <italic>A. indica</italic> in the mixed zone, and 
 <italic>I. cylindrica</italic> where no invasion of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> had occurred (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Fig. 1</xref>). Nine total rhizosphere samples were obtained. The individual sample sites in each zone were separated by at least 5 m. Sample sites in the different zones were separated by at least 10 m. To sample the rhizosphere soils of each species, individual plants were pulled up within an area of approximately 80 × 80 cm
 <sup>2</sup> and shaken to remove the soil loosely attached to the roots, ensuring only soil firmly adhering to the roots was sampled. A subset of these soil samples was frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA-seq analysis. Another set was placed separately into sterile Whirl-Pak sample bags (Nasco, Fort Atkinson, WI, USA) and transported to the laboratory within 1 h of collection where it was used for 16S rRNA gene and ITS fragment analyses. Approximately 500 g of each soil sample was homogenized (medium treatment for 1 min) in a Waring heavy-duty blender (Lab-Biogen, Kunming, China), which was carefully cleaned with 70% ethanol after each use, and immediately passed through a two mm sieve yielding samples used for subsequent physicochemical analysis and DNA extraction, as detailed below.
