<p>The study site was located in the foothills of Maomao Qing, Xishan, Kunming (24°55′29″N, 102°36′36″E), where the invasion of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> began in 1987. The vegetation of the study area consisted of a monoculture of 
 <italic>A. adenophora,</italic> a mixture of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> (40%–50% coverage) and the native species 
 <italic>A. indica</italic>, and 
 <italic>I. cylindrica</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Fig. 1</xref>). 
 <italic>I. cylindrica</italic> was initially present in the sample site area but was outcompeted by 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> and disappeared. The sample site was approximately 50 × 50 m
 <sup>2</sup> with a mean altitude of 2,170 (±0.5) m above sea level and with no tree coverage. The site had mountain red soil, an average annual temperature of 15.2 °C (ranging from 14.3–16.1 °C), and an average annual rain precipitation of 975 mm ranging from 937–1,058 mm.
