<p>We compared the compositional and metabolic characteristics of the RSM of the highly invasive weed 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> against those of two native species to elucidate the effects of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> root exudates on the composition and metabolism of its RSM and assessed the role of bacterial and fungal communities present in its nutrient cycles. We found that the composition of the bacterial and fungal communities of the 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> RSM varied in differing degrees to those of the two native species (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Figs. 2C</xref>&amp; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">2D</xref>). More compositional differences were observed in the RSM of 
 <italic>I. cylindrica</italic> in the uninvaded area than in that of 
 <italic>A. indica</italic> co-existing with 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic>. The RSM of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> had a higher (
 <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.05) percentage of bacterial Norank 480-2, 
 <italic>Rhodoplanes</italic>, uncultured 
 <italic>Xanthomonadales</italic>, 
 <italic>Variibacter,</italic> and fungal 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> than those of the native plant species. In an earlier study, 
 <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al. (2019)</xref> found members of the genera Gp6 (
 <italic>Acidobacteria</italic>), together with 
 <italic>Sphingomonas</italic>, and 
 <italic>Spartobacteria</italic> contributed most to the dissimilarities between rhizosphere soils of the weed 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> and other different native plant species. Such a striking discrepancy probably reflects differences in the native plant species and soil types used in the two studies.
