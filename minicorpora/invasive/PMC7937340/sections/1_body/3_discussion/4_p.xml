<p>We showed that there were greater similarities in the composition and expression levels of functional genes in the 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> and 
 <italic>A. indica</italic> RSMs than in 
 <italic>I. cylindrica</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Figs.Â 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">4A</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">4B</xref>, &amp; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">4C</xref>). Such compositional and metabolic similarities in the RSMs may explain why 
 <italic>A. indica</italic> can withstand invasion attempts by 
 <italic>A. adenophora,</italic> as shown by their coexistence at one site for at least 8 years. Higher levels of expression of genes associated with cell wall, membrane, and envelope biogenesis; amino acid transport and metabolism; energy production and conversion; carbohydrate transport and metabolism; secondary metabolite biosynthesis, transport, and catabolism; transcription; translation; ribosomal structure and biogenesis; replication, recombination, and repair; coenzyme transport and metabolism; and nucleotide transport and metabolism were seen in the RSM of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> than in either the RSMs of 
 <italic>A. indica</italic> and especially 
 <italic>I. cylindrica</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Fig. 3</xref>). Such enhancement of expression of these genes would suggest that the 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> RSM is more metabolically active than those of either native species.
