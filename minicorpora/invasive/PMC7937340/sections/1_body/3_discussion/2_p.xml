<p>Our 16S rRNA gene and ITS fragment sequencing (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Figs. 2C</xref> &amp; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">2D</xref>) and transcriptome data (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">Fig. 4B</xref>) are in agreement in showing fungi belonging to phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, and bacteria belonging to phyla Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Bacteroidetes are important players in the RSMs of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> and the two native plant species. The RSM fungal community of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> is thought to play a major role in its nutrition. The fungal community contributed 89.3% of the expressed genes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">Fig. 4A</xref>) and most (71.2%) were from members of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Of these, Ascomycota constituted more than half of ITS total reads (55%) and expressed genes (51%) in the 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> RSM. Saprotrophic fungi are known to be highly abundant active organisms in the rhizosphere, where they metabolize root exudates (
 <xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">Denef et al., 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">Bue√© et al., 2009</xref>) even more successfully than the rhizosphere soil bacteria under certain conditions (
