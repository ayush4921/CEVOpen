<p>Glomeromycota contributed 10.1% of the genes expressed in the 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> RSM, which was substantially higher than that expressed in the RSMs of both 
 <italic>A. indica</italic> (5.7%) and 
 <italic>I. cylindrica</italic> (0.1%) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">Fig. 4B</xref>), and so the RSM of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> had more (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.05) of these symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi than did that of 
 <italic>I. cylindrica</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2D</xref>). Therefore, it is likely they play a positive role in successful 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> invasion by enhancing the provision of N and P, especially if there are limited amounts in the soil, and in protecting it from parasite attack at the roots (

  <xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">Bajpai &amp; Inderjit, 2013</xref>; Perkin &amp; Nowak, 2013
 </italic>) especially since the gene expression profiles of enzymes associated with nitrogen fixation and transformation metabolism in the 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> RSM were similar to those of both 
 <italic>A. indica</italic> and 
 <italic>I. cylindrica</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">Fig. 5</xref>). These data suggest that attracting and stimulating the metabolic activity of Glomeromycota enhances the invasive capabilities of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic>, and is the first metabolic evidence to support an important role for AM fungi in 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> invasion.
