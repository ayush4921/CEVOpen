<p>Invasion by 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> did not affect gene expression levels associated with microbial nitrogen fixation, ammonia oxidation, and nitrite and nitrate reduction in the invaded soil. There was no evidence for the increased expression of N metabolic genes, which may also reflect high amounts of organic C (litter) present in the RSM of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> (
 <xref rid="table-1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), where its decomposition may release organic N in higher amounts than from either native plants, as reported for other invasive plant species (
 <xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">Ehrenfeld, Ravit &amp; Elgersma, 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">Hata, Kato &amp; Kachi, 2012</xref>;

 <xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2017</xref>). This is supported by evidence that more genes are associated with carbohydrate metabolism in the RSM of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> than in those of the native plant species. Interestingly, in their GeoChip study, 
 <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al. (2019)</xref> showed that the 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> RSM had higher nitrogen metabolism gene expression levels than those found in the native plant species examined. Such differences may arise from the measurement techniques used. GeoChip assays quantify gene expression in terms of the total DNA, transcriptomic analysis measures gene expression levels as mRNA synthesis. 
 <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al. (2019)</xref> compared the rhizosphere soil of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> to that of a mixture of soil samples from seven native plant species, and we compared the rhizosphere soil of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> individually with those of two native plant species.
