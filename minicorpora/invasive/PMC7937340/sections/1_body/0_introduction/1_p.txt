0: Ageratina adenophora (Sprengel, also known as  Eupatorium adenophorum Sprengel) is a weed originating in Mexico and Costa Rica that has invaded more than 40 tropical and subtropical countries in Asia, Oceania, Africa , and Europe  (  Poudel et al., 2019).
1: Its dominance can interfere with nutritional cycles, hydrological conditions, and the energy budgets of the plant-soil ecosystem, causing severe economic losses to the agricultural, forestry, and livestock industries ( Xu et al., 2006;  Kong et al., 2017).
2: Thus,  A. adenophora is often used as a model organism to study the possible mechanisms of plant invasion ( Datta et al., 2017;  Chen et al., 2019;  Fang et al., 2019;   Poudel et al., 2019;  Zhao et al., 2019).
3: The impact of plant soil feedback is of interest to explain the successful exotic invasion of  A. adenophora ( Niu et al., 2007;   Poudel et al., 2019;   Zhao et al., 2019).
4: The presence of  A. adenophora may alter soil nutrient availability by modifying the composition and function of its soil microbiome, thus facilitating its growth and competitiveness ( Niu et al., 2007;   Zhao et al., 2019).
