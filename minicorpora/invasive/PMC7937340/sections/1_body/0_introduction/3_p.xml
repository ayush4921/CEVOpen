<p>We investigated the composition and metabolic activities of the bacterial and fungal communities in the RSMs of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> and compared them to those of two native plant species, 
 <italic>Artemisia indica</italic> and 
 <italic>Imperata cylindrica,</italic> using 16S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) fragment high-throughput sequencing combined with transcriptome analysis. The results of this study improve our understanding of the role of RSM in the growth and invasiveness of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic>.
