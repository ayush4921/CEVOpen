0: Most soil microbiological studies associated with the invasion of  A. adenophora have examined the bulk soil beneath the plant.
1: A. adenophora tends to have higher levels of available C, N, and P ( Niu et al., 2007;   Kong et al., 2017;  Poudel et al., 2019;  Zhao et al., 2019), higher nitrogen-cycling rates ( Zhao et al., 2019), higher enzymatic (urase, phosphatase, and invertase) activities ( Li et al., 2009), and a higher abundance of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and fungi/bacteria ratio ( Niu et al., 2007) than soils inhabited by native plant species.
2: In previous studies, the composition of the bulk soil microbiomes beneath  A. adenophora differed from those beneath native plant species ( Niu et al., 2007;   Kong et al., 2017;   Zhao et al., 2019).
3: However, there have been few studies conducted on the structure and function of the rhizosphere soil microbiome (RSM) of this weed.
4: The soil immediately around the plant roots, known as the rhizosphere, is an area where plant soil feedback is important because it harbors an active and diverse microbiota consisting of both bacteria and fungi ( Inderjit & Van der Putten, 2010;  Van der Putten et al., 2013).
5: These microorganisms receive 20%50% of the plant hosts photosynthetically generated carbon ( Drigo et al., 2010).
6: However, the extent to which the composition and metabolism of the bacterial and fungal communities in the RSM of  A. adenophora differ from those of native plant species is still unclear.
7: In particular, the root leachate of  A. adenophora contains structurally diverse phytochemicals including terpenoids, phenylpropanoids, flavonoids, coumarins, and alkaloids ( He et al., 2008;   Dong et al., 2017), and some of these have been shown to possess allelopathic, phytotoxic, and antifeedant activities, and have the potential to substantially alter the microbiota of invaded soils ( Liu et al., 2010).
