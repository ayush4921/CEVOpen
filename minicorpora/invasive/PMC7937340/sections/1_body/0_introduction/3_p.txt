0: We investigated the composition and metabolic activities of the bacterial and fungal communities in the RSMs of  A. adenophora and compared them to those of two native plant species,  Artemisia indica and  Imperata cylindrica, using 16S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) fragment high-throughput sequencing combined with transcriptome analysis.
1: The results of this study improve our understanding of the role of RSM in the growth and invasiveness of  A. adenophora.
