<p>In conclusion, the data obtained in this study suggests that the RSM of the weed, 
 <italic>A. Adenophora</italic>, differs substantially in its bacterial and fungal communities to those of the two native plant species. The RSM of 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> contained higher percentage abundances of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes than those of the native plant species. Increased expression levels of genes associated with metabolic activities of transport and metabolism of amino acids, coenzymes, nucleotides and carbohydrates; energy production and conversion; transcription; and eventual cell growth in the 
 <italic>A. adenophora</italic> RSM play an important enhancing role in the nutritional metabolism of its rhizosphere soils, allowing it to invade a habitat already occupied by two native species, 
 <italic>A. indica</italic> and 
 <italic>I. cylindrica.</italic> The data also indicate that an increased level of gene expression in members of the fungal communities, especially the saprotrophic Ascomycota and Basidiomycota and the AM fungi Glomeromycota, played a role in its successful invasion.
