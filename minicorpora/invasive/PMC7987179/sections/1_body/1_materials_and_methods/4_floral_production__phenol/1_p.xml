<p>We recorded the total number of open staminate or pistillate flowers for each individual on 15 dates, between 20 May and 12 June 2008. All open flowers on an individual were counted and recorded when possible. Some individuals were too large or climbed too high to count all flowers, in which case a proportional sampling technique was used. For plants covering a large area, we estimated the number of flowers from approximately three square meters, and extrapolated to the ground area covered by the plants as estimated from on-the-ground measurements.</p>
