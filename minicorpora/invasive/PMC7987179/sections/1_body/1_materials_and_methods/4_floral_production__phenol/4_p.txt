0: Fruits collected during the fertilization study were supplemented by additional fruit collections from  C.  scandens, with the goal of increasing sample size and statistical power.
1: Emphasis was placed on fruits from the native species because a) no wild hybrids found had a  C.  orbiculatus maternal lineage [ 29], and b) there is more urgency in understanding hybridization in  C.  scandens, as it is species of concern in much of its native range.
2: Approximately 250 fruits were collected from 18  C.  scandens pistillate plants.
3: We extracted seeds from these fruits, applied cold stratification, and conducted genetic analyses using leaf tissue from the resulting seedlings [ 29].
4: We tested the relationship between hybridization rate and predictors relating to the availability of heterospecific and conspecific pollen (detailed below).
