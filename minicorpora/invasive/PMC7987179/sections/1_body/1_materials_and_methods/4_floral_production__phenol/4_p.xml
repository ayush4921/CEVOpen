<p>Fruits collected during the fertilization study were supplemented by additional fruit collections from 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>scandens</italic>, with the goal of increasing sample size and statistical power. Emphasis was placed on fruits from the native species because a) no wild hybrids found had a 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>orbiculatus</italic> maternal lineage [
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and b) there is more urgency in understanding hybridization in 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>scandens</italic>, as it is species of concern in much of its native range. Approximately 250 fruits were collected from 18 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>scandens</italic> pistillate plants. We extracted seeds from these fruits, applied cold stratification, and conducted genetic analyses using leaf tissue from the resulting seedlings [
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. We tested the relationship between hybridization rate and predictors relating to the availability of heterospecific and conspecific pollen (detailed below).
