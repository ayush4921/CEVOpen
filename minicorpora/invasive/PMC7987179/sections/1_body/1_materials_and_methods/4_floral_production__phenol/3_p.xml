<p>For both fertilization rate and fruit set, we investigated the relationship with several predictors. Analyses were conducted separately for each species. We were most interested in how fertilization and fruit set were related to the availability of conspecific and heterospecific pollen, but we also tested for a relationship with total floral production of the maternal plant and, in

The sample size of seedlings was too small to test for correlations between hybridization rate and multiple predictors, but the difference in hybridization rate between species was statistically compared. Details of the data analyses are described below.
