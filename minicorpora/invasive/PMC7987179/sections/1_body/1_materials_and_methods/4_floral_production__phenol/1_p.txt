0: We recorded the total number of open staminate or pistillate flowers for each individual on 15 dates, between 20 May and 12 June 2008.
1: All open flowers on an individual were counted and recorded when possible.
2: Some individuals were too large or climbed too high to count all flowers, in which case a proportional sampling technique was used.
3: For plants covering a large area, we estimated the number of flowers from approximately three square meters, and extrapolated to the ground area covered by the plants as estimated from on-the-ground measurements.
