0: For both fertilization rate and fruit set, we investigated the relationship with several predictors.
1: Analyses were conducted separately for each species.
2: We were most interested in how fertilization and fruit set were related to the availability of conspecific and heterospecific pollen, but we also tested for a relationship with total floral production of the maternal plant and, in  C.  scandens, inflorescence position.
3: The sample size of seedlings was too small to test for correlations between hybridization rate and multiple predictors, but the difference in hybridization rate between species was statistically compared.
4: Details of the data analyses are described below.
