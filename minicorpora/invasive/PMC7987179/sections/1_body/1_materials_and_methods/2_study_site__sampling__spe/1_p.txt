0: Experimental crosses and field observations took place at the Portage Lakefront within the Indiana Dunes National Park (near 41.63N, 87.18W).
1: The study site is composed of southern Lake Michigan sand dunes and wooded edges, bounded by the town of Ogden Dunes, Indiana, USA to the west and the Port of Indiana to the east ( Fig 1).
2: The site was chosen because reproductive individuals of both species are abundant, which is uncommon.
3: We attempted to include all flowering individuals in the observational studies, but some flowering individuals that may have been in nearby residential areas were not included in the study.
4: In total, the study included 39  C.  orbiculatus individuals (22 staminate, 14 pistillate, and 3 putatively monoecious) and 40  C.  scandens individuals (17 staminate, 21 pistillate, and 2 putatively monoecious).
5: This work was permitted by the National Park Service, permit number NH08.5216.
