<p>Field identification using reproductive structures [
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] was verified by genetic analysis of leaf tissue. Genomic DNA was extracted from 20â€“25 mg of ground leaf material using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) and each individual was scored at five microsatellite loci that are able to distinguish the two species and their hybrids [
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Microsatellite loci, PCR conditions, and genotyping methods are described in Zaya et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Genetic identities were tested using two Bayesian clustering approaches, STRUCTURE version 2.3 and NewHybrids version 1.1 beta [

 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] using options previously used to identify

 <italic>orbiculatus</italic> hybrids [
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. We used the posterior probability of an individual genotype belonging to a single genetic cluster, 
 <italic>q</italic>, to categorize hybrid seedlings. Seedlings with 
 <italic>q</italic> &gt; 0.85 were categorized as the result of conspecific pollination, while those with 
 <italic>q</italic> &lt; 0.65 were categorized as hybrids. No seedlings had 
 <italic>q</italic> values between these cutoffs. Spatial coordinates were measured with GPS for each individual included in the study. The coordinates were used to calculate the distance to each staminate plant for every pistillate individual.
