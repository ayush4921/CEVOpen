 <italic>Celastrus scandens</italic> L. (Celastraceae), commonly known as American bittersweet or American staff vine, is the only member of the genus native to North America [
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. It is a liana (woody vine) usually found in open habitats. Its range extends from southern Quebec to South Dakota, south to western Texas through Georgia. The native range of

 <italic>orbiculatus</italic> Thunb., commonly known as oriental or Asiatic bittersweet, is in Korea, Japan, and China [
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] where it is found in thickets and lowland slopes. In North America, it can also thrive in shaded habitats that would likely exclude

 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The North American range of

 <italic>orbiculatus</italic> overlaps with much of the range of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>scandens</italic> east of the Mississippi River, with fewer reports west of the Mississippi River. Both species are usually dioecious, although rare individuals and populations displaying monoecy or bisexual flowers are known. In both species, staminate flowers have five stamens. Pistillate flowers have a single pistil, a superior ovary, and three carpels with two ovules each. A single fruit can have up to six seeds. Insects, particularly native bees, pollinate both species [
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], with some wind-pollination observed for 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>orbiculatus</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Birds are largely credited as the dispersers of the seeds that sit inside the three bright red fleshy arils surrounded by an orange (

 <italic>orbiculatus</italic>) capsule that breaks open with first frost [
