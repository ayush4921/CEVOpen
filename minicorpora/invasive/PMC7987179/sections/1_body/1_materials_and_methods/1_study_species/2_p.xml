 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The species continues to spread, having recently (c. 2010) been observed for the first time in Minnesota. Land managers and foresters consider

 <italic>orbiculatus</italic> a troublesome species because it is a strong competitor that crowds out native vegetation [

 <italic>Celastrus scandens</italic> has been listed as a species of special concern in several states; it may be extirpated in Delaware, while it is listed as a vulnerable species in New York, a species of special concern in Connecticut, a threatened species in Massachusetts, and an endangered species in North Carolina and Rhode Island.
