0: Celastrus scandens L. (Celastraceae), commonly known as American bittersweet or American staff vine, is the only member of the genus native to North America [ 32].
1: It is a liana (woody vine) usually found in open habitats.
2: Its range extends from southern Quebec to South Dakota, south to western Texas through Georgia.
3: The native range of  C.  orbiculatus Thunb., commonly known as oriental or Asiatic bittersweet, is in Korea, Japan, and China [ 32] where it is found in thickets and lowland slopes.
4: In North America, it can also thrive in shaded habitats that would likely exclude  C.  scandens [ 33].
5: The North American range of  C.  orbiculatus overlaps with much of the range of  C.  scandens east of the Mississippi River, with fewer reports west of the Mississippi River.
6: Both species are usually dioecious, although rare individuals and populations displaying monoecy or bisexual flowers are known.
7: In both species, staminate flowers have five stamens.
8: Pistillate flowers have a single pistil, a superior ovary, and three carpels with two ovules each.
9: A single fruit can have up to six seeds.
10: Insects, particularly native bees, pollinate both species [ 34], with some wind-pollination observed for  C.  orbiculatus [ 35].
11: Birds are largely credited as the dispersers of the seeds that sit inside the three bright red fleshy arils surrounded by an orange ( C.  scandens) or yellow ( C.  orbiculatus) capsule that breaks open with first frost [ 34].
