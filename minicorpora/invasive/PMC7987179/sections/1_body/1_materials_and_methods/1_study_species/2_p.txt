0: Celastrus orbiculatus was introduced as an ornamental vine to the eastern USA in the mid- to late-nineteenth century.
1: The first reports of it escaping into the wild came in the early twentieth century; by the middle of the twentieth century it was recognized as a pest species rapidly spreading in the eastern USA [ 27,  36].
2: The species continues to spread, having recently (c. 2010) been observed for the first time in Minnesota.
3: Land managers and foresters consider  C.  orbiculatus a troublesome species because it is a strong competitor that crowds out native vegetation [ 37], negatively affects forestry operation [ 38], and can alter natural successional trajectories [ 39].
4: Notably,  C.  scandens has declined in the eastern United States where invasion by  C.  orbiculatus is oldest and most extreme [ 30,  31,  40], although a causal link between the two patterns has not been established.
5: Celastrus scandens has been listed as a species of special concern in several states; it may be extirpated in Delaware, while it is listed as a vulnerable species in New York, a species of special concern in Connecticut, a threatened species in Massachusetts, and an endangered species in North Carolina and Rhode Island.
