<p>To test the hypotheses that fertilization rate, fruit set, and hybridization rate differed for open-pollinated 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>scandens</italic> and 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>orbiculatus</italic>, we used generalized linear models (GLM) with binomial responses. For each test, the explanatory variable was species identity of maternal plant, and the subjects (i.e., units of replication) were the individual maternal plants (fertilization rate and fruit set, n = 40 [23 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>scandens</italic> and 17 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>orbiculatus</italic>]; hybridization rate, n = 19 [nine 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>scandens</italic> and 10 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>orbiculatus</italic>]). Monoecious plants were included in these analyses. For analyses of hybridization rates only plants with flowers resulting in at least one seedling were included.
