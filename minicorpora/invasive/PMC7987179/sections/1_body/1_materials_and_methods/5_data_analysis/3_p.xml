<p>We removed an incompatibility term, 
 <italic>c</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>ij</italic>
 </sub>, and instead excluded other pistillate plants in the calculation (those which would have 
 <italic>c</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>ij</italic>
 </sub> = 0). We weighted the mating potential by log
 <sub>10</sub> male floral production, 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>j</italic>
 </sub>, for each 
 <italic>j</italic>-th father on the particular day that a flower was marked. Distance from the 
 <italic>i</italic>-th mother (which carried the flower) to each 
 <italic>j</italic>-th father is 
 <italic>d</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>ij</italic>
 </sub>. We used the same value for Î³, the inverse of the mean pollination distance (13.3 m
 <sup>-1</sup>), as Wagenius et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], who studied an insect-pollinated self-incompatible plant (
 <italic>Celastrus</italic> spp. are dioecious).
