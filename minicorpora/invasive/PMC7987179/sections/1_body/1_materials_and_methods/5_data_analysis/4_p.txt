0: To test the relationship between hybridization rate in  C.  scandens and the availability of conspecific and heterospecific pollen, we used a GLM with binomial response.
1: The subjects of the analysis were individual maternal plants from which seeds were collected and germinated (n = 18, with 259 total seedlings).
2: The response variable was the proportion of successfully germinated seedlings that were hybrids.
3: Four fixed effects were tested: distance to the nearest conspecific male (staminate  C.  scandens), distance to the nearest heterospecific male (staminate  C.  orbiculatus), log 10 floral production of the nearest co-flowering conspecific male, and log 10 floral production on the nearest co-flowering heterospecific male.
4: All fixed effects were included in separate models.
5: Additionally, we tested three two-way interactions (conspecific distance X heterospecific distance, conspecific distance X conspecific floral production, heterospecific distance X heterospecific floral production).
6: A staminate plant was considered as co-flowering if it had open staminate flowers on the mean flowering date of the pistillate subject.
