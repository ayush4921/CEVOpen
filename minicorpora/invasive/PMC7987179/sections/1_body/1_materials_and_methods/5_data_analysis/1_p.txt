0: To test the hypotheses that fertilization rate, fruit set, and hybridization rate differed for open-pollinated  C.  scandens and  C.  orbiculatus, we used generalized linear models (GLM) with binomial responses.
1: For each test, the explanatory variable was species identity of maternal plant, and the subjects (i.e., units of replication) were the individual maternal plants (fertilization rate and fruit set, n = 40 [23  C.  scandens and 17  C.  orbiculatus]; hybridization rate, n = 19 [nine  C.  scandens and 10  C.  orbiculatus]).
2: Monoecious plants were included in these analyses.
3: For analyses of hybridization rates only plants with flowers resulting in at least one seedling were included.
