0: We removed an incompatibility term,  cij, and instead excluded other pistillate plants in the calculation (those which would have  cij = 0).
1: We weighted the mating potential by log 10 male floral production,  Fj, for each  j-th father on the particular day that a flower was marked.
2: Distance from the  i-th mother (which carried the flower) to each  j-th father is  dij.
3: We used the same value for , the inverse of the mean pollination distance (13.3 m -1), as Wagenius et al.
4: [ 46], who studied an insect-pollinated self-incompatible plant ( Celastrus spp.
5: are dioecious).
