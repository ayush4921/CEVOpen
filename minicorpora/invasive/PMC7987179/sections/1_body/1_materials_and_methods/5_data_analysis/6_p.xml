<p>All statistical tests were completed using R version 3.6.2 [
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The GLMM tests were implemented using the 
 <italic>lme4</italic> package [
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], and in all cases random intercept models were constructed with maternal identity as the random effect. For each test, we used the Akaike Information Criterion corrected for small sample size (AICc) to select the best model from a group of candidate models. Akaike weights were calculated for each model, which can be interpreted as the probability that a given model is the one that best approximates the data assuming one exists in the candidate set. In all cases a null model, with no fixed effects, was included as a candidate model. The coefficient of determination (

 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and for GLMM using the pseudo-
