<p>To test the relationship between hybridization rate in

 <italic>scandens</italic> and the availability of conspecific and heterospecific pollen, we used a GLM with binomial response. The subjects of the analysis were individual maternal plants from which seeds were collected and germinated (n = 18, with 259 total seedlings). The response variable was the proportion of successfully germinated seedlings that were hybrids. Four fixed effects were tested: distance to the nearest conspecific male (staminate

 <italic>orbiculatus</italic>), log
 <sub>10</sub> floral production of the nearest co-flowering conspecific male, and log
 <sub>10</sub> floral production on the nearest co-flowering heterospecific male. All fixed effects were included in separate models. Additionally, we tested three two-way interactions (conspecific distance X heterospecific distance, conspecific distance X conspecific floral production, heterospecific distance X heterospecific floral production). A staminate plant was considered as “co-flowering” if it had open staminate flowers on the mean flowering date of the pistillate subject.
