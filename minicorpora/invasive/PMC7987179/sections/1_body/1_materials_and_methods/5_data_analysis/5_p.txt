0: To test for species differences in the experimental hand crosses, we used a GLM to compare the rate of successful heterospecific pollination.
1: The GLM was constructed so that fertilization success in heterospecific crosses was the binomial response and species identity of maternal plant was the explanatory variable (n = 10 pistillate plants, five of each species).
