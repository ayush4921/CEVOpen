<p>To test for species differences in the experimental hand crosses, we used a GLM to compare the rate of successful heterospecific pollination. The GLM was constructed so that fertilization success in heterospecific crosses was the binomial response and species identity of maternal plant was the explanatory variable (n = 10 pistillate plants, five of each species).</p>
