<p>Experimental hand cross-pollinations were carried out in 2006 to test differences between the species in accepting heterospecific pollen, a possible mechanism behind asymmetric hybridization. Inflorescences on each of 10 pistillate plants, five pistillate plants of each species, were bagged with bridal mesh while still in bud, to exclude pollinators. For each pistillate plant, 25 flowers were hand-pollinated with freshly dehisced anthers from five staminate plants of the other species (five flowers were devoted to each staminate plant). In total, 250 flowers were hand-pollinated. The flowers were observed approximately 10 days later for signs of fertilization, in the form of an ovary that had swelled and not senesced. We compared the rate of successful heterospecific fertilization in each species.</p>
