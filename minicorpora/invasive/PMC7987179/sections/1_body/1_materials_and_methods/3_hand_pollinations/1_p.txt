0: Experimental hand cross-pollinations were carried out in 2006 to test differences between the species in accepting heterospecific pollen, a possible mechanism behind asymmetric hybridization.
1: Inflorescences on each of 10 pistillate plants, five pistillate plants of each species, were bagged with bridal mesh while still in bud, to exclude pollinators.
2: For each pistillate plant, 25 flowers were hand-pollinated with freshly dehisced anthers from five staminate plants of the other species (five flowers were devoted to each staminate plant).
3: In total, 250 flowers were hand-pollinated.
4: The flowers were observed approximately 10 days later for signs of fertilization, in the form of an ovary that had swelled and not senesced.
5: We compared the rate of successful heterospecific fertilization in each species.
