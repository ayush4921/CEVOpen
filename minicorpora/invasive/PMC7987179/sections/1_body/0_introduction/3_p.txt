0: In this study we investigated reproductive interactions between an invasive vine,  Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb.
1: and a native congener,  C.  scandens L.  Celastrus orbiculatus was introduced to North America from Asia [ 27] and has subsequently spread across much of the native range of  C.  scandens.
2: The two species are known to hybridize in controlled settings [ 28] and in the wild [ 29].
3: Hybrid individuals are uncommon in the wild, but a previous study found that all genetically identified hybrids had a  C.  scandens maternal lineage [ 29].
4: It has not been demonstrated that this asymmetric hybridization is linked to the decline of  C.  scandens, but declines are especially severe in parts of the eastern United States where the invasion is the oldest [ 30,  31].
5: While large-scale plant surveys can provide some insight into the dynamics of invasion and hybridization, fine-scale studies of invasive heterospecific pollen transfer are needed to directly assess impacts on native plants [ 12,  19].
