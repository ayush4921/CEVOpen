<p>In this study we investigated reproductive interactions between an invasive vine, 
 <italic>Celastrus orbiculatus</italic> Thunb. and a native congener, 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>scandens</italic> L. 
 <italic>Celastrus orbiculatus</italic> was introduced to North America from Asia [
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and has subsequently spread across much of the native range of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>scandens</italic>. The two species are known to hybridize in controlled settings [
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and in the wild [
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Hybrid individuals are uncommon in the wild, but a previous study found that all genetically identified hybrids had a 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>scandens</italic> maternal lineage [
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. It has not been demonstrated that this asymmetric hybridization is linked to the decline of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>scandens</italic>, but declines are especially severe in parts of the eastern United States where the invasion is the oldest [
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. While large-scale plant surveys can provide some insight into the dynamics of invasion and hybridization, fine-scale studies of invasive heterospecific pollen transfer are needed to directly assess impacts on native plants [
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].
