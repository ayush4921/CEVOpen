0: Reproductive interference by invasives can occur even without disruption of pollinator networks and visitation rates through heterospecific pollination.
1: Pollen from an invasive species may reduce successful fertilization of natives by conspecific pollen [ 16].
2: This could occur through chemical or physical interference in the stigma by invasive pollen [ 19] or because the invasive pollen is simply much more abundant than native pollen [ 20].
3: Rejection of invasive pollen is especially difficult when the native and invasive species are closely related, such as congeners [ 12].
4: If heterospecific fertilization occurs, female reproductive effort may be wasted on fertilized ovules that rarely develop into viable seeds [ 21].
5: If viable hybrids survive, this may lead to decline of the native due to seed discounting and wasted reproductive effort [ 22].
6: Additionally, hybrids may be especially numerous, fit, or fecund, leading to hybrid swarms that exclude the native species [ 6,  23,  24].
7: Finally, continued asymmetric introgression may lead to genetic dilution of the native species gene pool [ 20,  25,  26].
