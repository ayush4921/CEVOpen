<p>Reproductive interference by invasives can occur even without disruption of pollinator networks and visitation rates through heterospecific pollination. Pollen from an invasive species may reduce successful fertilization of natives by conspecific pollen [
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This could occur through chemical or physical interference in the stigma by invasive pollen [
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] or because the invasive pollen is simply much more abundant than native pollen [
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Rejection of invasive pollen is especially difficult when the native and invasive species are closely related, such as congeners [
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. If heterospecific fertilization occurs, female reproductive effort may be wasted on fertilized ovules that rarely develop into viable seeds [
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. If viable hybrids survive, this may lead to decline of the native due to seed discounting and wasted reproductive effort [
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Additionally, hybrids may be especially numerous, fit, or fecund, leading to “hybrid swarms” that exclude the native species [
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Finally, continued asymmetric introgression may lead to genetic dilution of the native species’ gene pool [
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].
