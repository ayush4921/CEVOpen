<p>We hypothesized that reproductive interference of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>scandens</italic> occurs in the presence of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>orbiculatus</italic>. We collected data at the Indiana Dunes National Park (Indiana, USA) at a site where 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>scandens</italic> and 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>orbiculatus</italic> occur in similar abundances, which provided an opportunity to test this hypothesis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248635.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Because both species are dioecious, we could specifically assess the relationship between male floral production and reproductive interference. We used experimental hand-crosses to compare the responses of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>scandens</italic> and 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>orbiculatus</italic> to heterospecific pollination. For open-pollinated plants in the field, we evaluated the relationship between the availability of conspecific or heterospecific pollen and rates of fertilization and hybridization. Hybrids were identified using previously published genetic markers. Our study was designed to test our hypothesis of reproductive interference between 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>orbiculatus</italic> and 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>scandens</italic>, understand the causes of asymmetrical pollen flow, evaluate the threat that heterospecific pollination poses to 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>scandens</italic>, and advise conservation strategies for an increasingly rare native plant.
