<p>Threats posed by invasive plant species to native ecosystems are a growing concern, with mounting evidence of increasing rates of invasion [

 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], disruptions of ecosystem function [

 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and reductions in native community diversity [

 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Recent work has highlighted the potential of invasive plants to disrupt pollination systems and negatively impact reproductive success of native plants [

 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. While much attention has focused on pollinator networks and pre-pollination dynamics in invaded systems [
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], invasive species can also alter post-pollination dynamics. Threats posed by increased heterospecific pollination (also referred to as ‘interspecific’ pollen by some authors) and reproductive interference during invasions has been documented in several systems [
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Two recent meta-analyses demonstrate that the threat posed by invasive plants through reproductive interference is potentially widespread. Arceo-Gómez and Ashman [
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] found that invasive plants are more detrimental as heterospecific pollen donors than are native plants, and that the negative effects are greater when the invasive pollen donor and recipient are closely related. Burns et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] found that invasives produce more than 250 times more flowers per plant compared to their native relatives. While Burns et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] emphasize that this allows invasives to compensate for or avoid pollen limitation, an additional consequence could be increased heterospecific pollination of co-occurring natives that share their pollinators.
