<p>Once a flower is fertilized, none of our potential explanatory variables predicted development to fruit in

 <xref rid="pone.0248635.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). With regards to the variables we measured, all fertilized flowers have the same likelihood of developing into fruit. Most importantly, we did not find statistical evidence that flowers exposed to large amounts of heterospecific pollen were less likely to develop into fruit (i.e., were more likely to be aborted). This pattern is consistent with the high rates of hybridization we measured in 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>scandens</italic> seedlings. Genetic tests of seedlings showed that in 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>scandens</italic>, 39% of seedlings tested were hybrids, while hybrids comprised only 1.6% of seedlings from 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>orbiculatus</italic>. These values are notable because of the extreme asymmetry (nearly unidirectional) and because such a high proportion of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>scandens</italic> seedlings were hybrids. The proportion of hybrid seedlings in 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>scandens</italic> is large compared to some other studies that measured hybridization rates between native and introduced species, such as the 16% and less reported for
