<p>Overall, the results of our study strongly suggest that the decline of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>scandens</italic> in its historical range is due at least in part to reproductive interference by 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>orbiculatus</italic>. Although 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>orbiculatus</italic> has been shown to be a superior competitor in several respects and can escape the negative effects of high density [

 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], the targeted nature of reproductive interference and the spatial scale of its action make it a more likely explanation than resource competition alone. 
 <italic>Celastrus orbiculatus</italic> is a recent invader of North America that continues to spread and proliferate. The density-dependence associated with reproductive interference through heterospecific pollination suggests that the decline of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>scandens</italic> will accelerate and spread over a larger area, unless large and broad efforts to reverse the spread of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>orbiculatus</italic> are undertaken. A feedback between decreased abundance and increased heterospecific pollination in 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>scandens</italic> may occur [
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], potentially leading to extirpation from much of its native range. Efforts to conserve 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>scandens</italic> can derive guidance from our results, such as reducing exposure to 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>orbiculatus</italic> pollen and providing substantial isolation from 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>orbiculatus</italic>, as reproductive interference may span tens to hundreds of meters. Previous work showed that hybrids have reduced fecundity [
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], so introgression does not threaten the genetic identity of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>scandens</italic> at this time. Thus, 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>scandens</italic> populations that were previously exposed to heterospecific pollen may still represent pure lines that are suitable for conservation or re-establishment.
