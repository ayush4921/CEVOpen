<p>Our study was designed to investigate the reproductive interactions between a declining native plant, 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>scandens</italic>, and an aggressive invasive congener, 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>orbiculatus</italic>. 
 <italic>Celastrus orbiculatus</italic> thrives across the range of conditions where 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>scandens</italic> occurs [
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], creating the potential for interactions with the invasive vine in most places where 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>scandens</italic> is found. We chose a study site where both species occur in roughly equal abundances, and we investigated fertilization and hybridization patterns in both species. Our findings confirmed our hypothesis that reproductive interference of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>scandens</italic> occurs in the presence of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>orbiculatus</italic>.
