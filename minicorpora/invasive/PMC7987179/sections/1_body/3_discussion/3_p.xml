<p>The high male fecundity of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>orbiculatus</italic> appears to explain the increased fertilization rate in nearby pistillate plants of both species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248635.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The best predictors of fertilization rate differed between the two species. For the native species, both increased conspecific and heterospecific mating potential were correlated with higher fertilization rates. For the invasive species, only conspecific mating potential was significantly correlated with fertilization. Thus, proximity to flowering staminate 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>orbiculatus</italic> increases fertilization of both the native and invasive species. These results support an emerging pattern that underscores the threat that heterospecific pollen from invasive plants may pose to native plant reproductive success [

 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In this case, it is likely that high rates of heterospecific pollination lead to usurpation of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>scandens</italic> ovules through production of hybrids. Our previous study found that hybrids show reduced seed set and small, likely inviable pollen [
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], so the reproductive effort of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>scandens</italic> is probably wasted on production of hybrid offspring. Early-flowering 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>scandens</italic> may be more susceptible to hybridization because of greater exposure to heterospecific pollen as peak flowering in 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>orbiculatus</italic> occurs at about the same time as the start of flowering in 
 <italic>C</italic>.
