<p>Results from the experimental hand crosses showed that 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>scandens</italic> readily accepts 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>orbiculatus</italic> pollen, but 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>orbiculatus</italic> largely rejects pollen from 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>scandens</italic>, providing direct evidence that the two species react differently when heterospecific pollen arrives to a stigma. Such differences in prezygotic barriers can be responsible for the creation of asymmetric hybridization [
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and indeed the few 
 <italic>Celastrus</italic> hybrids identified in the field all had a 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>scandens</italic> seed parent [
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The difference in the ability to recognize and reject heterospecific pollen might be expected in this system; the native range of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>orbiculatus</italic> overlaps with several congeners, while 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>scandens</italic> is not naturally sympatric with any closely related species [
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Heterospecific tolerance or avoidance is likely to evolve in regions with higher floral diversification [
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] and the degree of tolerance may be related to the recipient’s history of exposure to heterospecific pollen [
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Pollen germination and pollen tube growth may be difficult to prevent between closely related species because they share similar stigma morphology and pollen-stigma recognition systems [
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. However, invasive species may be especially tolerant of heterospecific pollen. In a coastal dune system investigated by Suárez‐Mariño [
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], the invasive species (
 <italic>Bidens pilosa</italic>) received more heterospecific pollen than the natives (
 <italic>Cakile edentula</italic> and 
 <italic>Scaevola plumieri</italic>), but heterospecific pollen receipt only had negative effects on the native species. In our system, it is unlikely that 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>orbiculatus</italic> received more heterospecific pollen than 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>scandens</italic>, but the hand pollination results indicate that the invasive species would be able to reject almost all it received. Thus, differences in male fecundity as well as different responses to heterospecific pollen both contribute to asymmetric hybridization in this system.
