<p>In 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>scandens</italic>, the proportion of fertilized flowers that developed to fruit was not associated with any of the explanatory variables we tested, as the null model outperformed all candidate models with fixed effects (

 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>orbiculatus</italic>, fruit development was negatively associated with total floral production; fewer fertilized flowers successfully developed on pistillate plants with more flowers (
