<p>When an additional 216

 <italic>scandens</italic> seedlings were included, from 18 pistillate plants, supplementing the data from the individually marked flowers, we found an overall hybridization rate of 0.39 (

 <italic>orbiculatus</italic>, log floral production of the nearest co-flowering staminate 
 <italic>C</italic>.

 <xref rid="pone.0248635.t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>). This model vastly outperformed the next best model, which included only the log floral production of the nearest heterospecific male (ΔAICc = 34.4, Akaike weight &lt; 0.0001). Hybridization rate increased as the distance to the nearest

 <italic>orbiculatus</italic> staminate plant decreased (

 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>orbiculatus</italic> male had greater floral production, as demonstrated by the statistical interaction (
