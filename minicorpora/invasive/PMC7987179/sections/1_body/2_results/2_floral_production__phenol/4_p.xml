<p>When following the fate of marked pistillate flowers, we found that 8.4% of flowers in 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>scandens</italic> developed into mature fruits (
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>orbiculatus</italic>, 10.8% of flowers developed into mature fruits (
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). When considering only fertilized flowers, the fruit set rates were 32.1% in 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>scandens</italic> and 23.9% in 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>orbiculatus</italic>. We did not find statistical support for a difference between species when considering all flowers (GLM with no fixed effect was preferred, ΔAICc = 1.0, Akaike weight = 0.627) or only fertilized flowers (ΔAICc = 0.41, Akaike weight = 0.551).
