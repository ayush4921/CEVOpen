<p>Genetic analyses of germinated seedlings that arose from marked flowers showed a large difference in the number of hybrid seedlings between the two species (

The GLM that included species as a predictor of hybridization rate performed much better than the null model (Î”AICc = 37.6, Akaike weight &gt; 0.9999, adjusted
