 <italic>orbiculatus</italic> and two 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>scandens</italic> individuals were monoecious, with both pistillate and staminate flowers. One type of flower dominated in each individual. In two cases (one of each species) only two pistillate flowers were observed compared to dozens of staminate flowers. In two plants (one of each species) staminate flowers outnumbered pistillate flowers by approximately 3-to-1. In one large 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>orbiculatus</italic> plant, there was a 3.5-to-1 ratio in favor of pistillate flowers. Monoecious individuals were included in calculations of explanatory variables (e.g., conspecific mating potential) for other pistillate individuals, but the staminate flowers from the same individual were not considered in such calculations.
