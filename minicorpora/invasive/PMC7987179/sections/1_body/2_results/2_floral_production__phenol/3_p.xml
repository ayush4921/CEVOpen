<p>Observations on the fate of open-pollinated pistillate flowers are shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Fertilization rate was 27.4% for

 <italic>scandens</italic> and 44.1% for 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>orbiculatus</italic>. We found statistical support for a difference between species with respect to fertilization rate (GLM that included species as a fixed effect outperformed the null model, ΔAICc = 19.2, Akaike weight &gt; 0.9999, adjusted

 </sup> = 0.130). Conspecific mating potential was associated with increased fertilization in both species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248635.g003">Fig 3</xref>) and was the best-supported explanatory variable in both species (Tables 
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.t003" ref-type="table">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.t004" ref-type="table">4</xref>). However, for heterospecific mating potential, the patterns differed between the two species. In 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>scandens</italic>, heterospecific mating potential was positively correlated with fertilization, a relationship that was strongly supported (ΔAICc = 10.1 when compared to null model, 
 <xref rid="pone.0248635.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). In 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>orbiculatus</italic>, the relationship was 
 <italic>negative</italic> and weakly supported (ΔAICc = 0.2 when compared to null model,
