 <caption> Fertilization rate and conspecific or heterospecific mating potential. Results from 317 individually marked C. scandens (A, B) and 399 individually marked C. orbiculatus (C, D) flowers are shown. Numbers above the symbols represent the number of flowers included in each binned category. In C. scandens, fertilization rate was statistically associated with conspecific mating potential (A; Table 3) and heterospecific mating potential (B; Table 3). In C. orbiculatus, fertilization rate was only associated with conspecific mating potential (C: Table 4). See Eq 1 for the calculation of mating potentials. Error bars represent the standard error. </caption>
