  <title>Hybridization rate and distance to the nearest heterospecific male in

  <p>Data from open-pollinated pistillate plants. Each point represents the proportion hybrids from a single pistillate 
   <italic>C</italic>. 
   <italic>scandens</italic> (n = 18 pistillate plants, with 259 total seedlings). Red triangles represent the six pistillate individuals for which the nearest 
   <italic>C</italic>. 
   <italic>orbiculatus</italic> had the fewest flowers, blue squares represent the six pistillate individuals for which the nearest 
   <italic>C</italic>. 
   <italic>orbiculatus</italic> had the most flowers. Black circles are pistillate plants for which the nearest 
   <italic>C</italic>. 
   <italic>orbiculatus</italic> had an intermediate number of flowers. Curves represent the predicted values from the best performing GLM, and colors correspond to the points.
