 <caption> Hybridization rate and distance to the nearest heterospecific male in C. scandens. Data from open-pollinated pistillate plants. Each point represents the proportion hybrids from a single pistillate C. scandens (n = 18 pistillate plants, with 259 total seedlings). Red triangles represent the six pistillate individuals for which the nearest C. orbiculatus had the fewest flowers, blue squares represent the six pistillate individuals for which the nearest C. orbiculatus had the most flowers. Black circles are pistillate plants for which the nearest C. orbiculatus had an intermediate number of flowers. Curves represent the predicted values from the best performing GLM, and colors correspond to the points. </caption>
