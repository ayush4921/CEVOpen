<p id="Par26">In a separate experiment we assessed the potential longevity of SPLAT-ME by hanging traps with differently aged lures at 30 m distance from each other. Here differences between capture rates of lures of different ages were less pronounced. Thirty-day old lures and 15-day old lures were less attractive than younger lures (p &lt; 0.0001 compared to 1, 5 &amp; 7 day). However, 15-day old lures caught higher numbers than the 30-day old lure (p = 0.0003). SPLAT-ME dollops thus continued to attract males, in spite of becoming relatively less attractive over time.</p>
