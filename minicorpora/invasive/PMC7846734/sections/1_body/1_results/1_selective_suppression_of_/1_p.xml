<p id="Par22">In 2013 the population of 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> in UAAIE was very high, to the extent that a single ME trap captured thousands of male flies in less than 30 min in an area bordering a guava orchard (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> inset). Flies emerging from collected guava fruits consisted of 99.8% of 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> and only 0.002% being 
 <italic>C. capitata</italic> (n = 20 guava fruits, 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>capitata</italic> = 2, 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> = 1340). Using a combination of three management methods (M3 bait station for male annihilation, GF-120 bait sprays containing Spinosad, and orchard sanitation) the large scale farm management targeted the fruit fly population in Upper Awash, resulting in a severe suppression of the population of 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> within eight months (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and a resurgence of the population of 
 <italic>C. capitata</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>A). At the start of trials in guava fields, the catches of 
 <italic>C. capitata</italic> were already higher than that of 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> and remained so throughout the 35-week intervention period (Supporting information Fig.
