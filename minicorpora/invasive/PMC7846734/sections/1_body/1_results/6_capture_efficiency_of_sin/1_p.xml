<p id="Par29">In the UAAIE large-scale farm, following suppression of the 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> population, the 
 <italic>C. capitata</italic> population rebounded. Under these circumstances the combined male lure (CML) and TML captured similar numbers of 
 <italic>C. capitata,</italic> while TA was less effective (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>A). Similarly, ME alone or in combination with the other male lures captured similar numbers of 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>B). In smallholder farming settings in Arba-Minch, where no management procedures were in place, the catches of 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> were several orders of magnitude higher than that of 
 <italic>C. capitata</italic> (n = 64, p &lt; 0.001, Supporting information Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Under these circumstances, combining TML with ME (CML) reduced the number of 
 <italic>C. capitata</italic> caught compared to traps baited with TML or TA alone (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>B). In contrast, 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> capture with ME was unaffected in combination with TA and TML (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>B).
