0: To determine potential competitive displacement and resource partitioning of  C. capitata, ripe fruits from, guava,  P. guajava, orange,  C. sinensis and exotic & local varieties of mango,  M. indica were randomly sampled from intervention treated plot in Arba-Minch.
1: Sampling was performed from March to June 2015.
2: Trees from each host fruit were randomly selected and variable numbers of fruits with oviposition marks were collected depending on availability and fruiting season.
3: In total, 1440 local mango, 1440 guava, 624 orange and 360 exotic mango fruits were sampled and weighed.
4: Samples were transferred to the laboratory at Arba-Minch plant health clinic and placed in plastic containers (12  22  30 cm) on a dry sand layer (12 cm deep).
5: Depending on the size of the fruits, 510 fruits were placed in each plastic container.
6: Fruits were transferred to other plastic containers every 3 days.
7: Pupae recovered from sands were transferred to bug dorm cages (30  30  30 cm) for identification of emerging fruit fly adults.
