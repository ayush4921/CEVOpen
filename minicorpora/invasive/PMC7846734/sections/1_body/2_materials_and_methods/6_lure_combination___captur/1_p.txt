0: Attractiveness of the combined male lure (CML, which contains 20% ME + 10% TA + 10% TML + 5% sugar + 2% spinosad) to  B. dorsalis and  C. capitata flies was compared with its individual components: ME (20% ME + 2% spinosad), TML (10% TML + 5% sugar + 2% spinosad) and TA (10% TA + 5% sugar + 2% spinosad) to test if the combinations of male attractants would result in different catch numbers compared to single lures.
1: For this experiment, two types of traps were used.
2: In the smallholder farming setting a modified transparent water bottle trap (1.5 L) with two fly entry openings in the upper half of the bottle (~ 7 mm diam.)
3: was used.
4: In the large-scale farm, we used a commercially available trap, Easytrap.
5: Traps were baited with a 3 g dollop of either ME, TML, TA or CML.
6: Four traps, each containing one of the dollops, were hung at 30 m distance from each other.
7: This was replicated in four plots at Arba-Minch and four plots at UAAIE (a plot is ~ 1 ha).
8: As the  B. dorsalis population was high in Arba-Minch, we used the larger modified water bottle traps, and trap catches were counted daily.
9: At UAAIE traps were serviced once a week.
10: The experiment was conducted between 2015-02-14 and 2015-07-02.
