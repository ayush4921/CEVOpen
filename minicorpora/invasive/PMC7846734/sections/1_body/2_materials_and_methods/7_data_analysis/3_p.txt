0: Lure longevity was assessed for traps placed at 30 m distance as well as in close proximity (1 m) and for each lure age using a generalized linear mixed model (glm) fitted with a negative binomial distribution (study week as random effect), this was followed by a Tukeys all-pairwise comparison to determine differences between differently aged lures.
1: Akaikes information criteria (AIC) values as well as patterns of residual values were used to determine normality and the best fitting model/distribution.
