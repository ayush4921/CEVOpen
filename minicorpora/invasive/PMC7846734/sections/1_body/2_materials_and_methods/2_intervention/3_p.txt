0: Following the suppression of  B. dorsalis, and the resurgence of  C. capitata, we rolled out treatments to assess how population levels of both species developed using SPLAT-MAT based methods.
1: A total of 4 experimental blocks of guava were divided into 4 plots of ~ 1 ha each.
2: Two of the plots in 3 of the blocks were treated with ME + spinosad, against  B. dorsalis) dollops and the other two plots of these 3 blocks were treated with TA + TML + spinosad dollops (against  Ceratitis species).
3: Each plot received 360 g divided over 120 dollops.
4: All plots in the fourth block were treated with dollops of ME alone without insecticide, which served as control plots.
5: Dollops were applied in caps of water bottles and tied to branches of guava trees, which were removed once a week for assessing population levels.
6: Four different monitoring traps (CML + spinosad, TML + spinosad, ME + spinosad & ME alone) were deployed in all plots and population levels were assessed each week.
7: The experiment was conducted during 35 weeks between 2014-11-19 and 2015-07-22.
