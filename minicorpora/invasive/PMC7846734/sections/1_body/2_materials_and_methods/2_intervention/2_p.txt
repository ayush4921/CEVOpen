0: At the large-scale farm three main techniques were used by the management to suppress  B. dorsalis population throughout the entire farm, including M3 Fruit Fly Bait Station (Green trading cc, SA), GF-120 containing spinosad (DOW AgroSciences LLC, Indianapolis, IN) and orchard sanitation.
1: GF-120 was diluted in water as recommended in the label 1:5 ratio of GF-120:water and sprayed with a hand-pumped back-pack sprayer using a conventional conical nozzle with 12 mm aperture.
2: Approximately 25 ml/tree of the solution was sprayed on a regular schedule at 15 days interval at approximately 1.5 m on trees not bearing fruit.
3: The M3 Fruit Fly Bait Stations were hung on trees at 4 m distances.
4: The efficacy of the treatments (GF-120 & M3) were monitored using a variable number of traps (Easytrap (H14 cm X W9cm X D5cm J.p. Ros, INIA, Madrid) per ha baited with ME and malathion.
5: We plotted the average fruit fly per trap per day (FTD) values of trap catches in the Guava orchard over 8 months (Fig.
6: 1).
