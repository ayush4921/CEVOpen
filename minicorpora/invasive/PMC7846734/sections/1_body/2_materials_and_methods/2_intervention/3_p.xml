<p id="Par10">Following the suppression of 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic>, and the resurgence of 
 <italic>C. capitata</italic>, we rolled out treatments to assess how population levels of both species developed using SPLAT-MAT based methods. A total of 4 experimental blocks of guava were divided into 4 plots of ~ 1 ha each. Two of the plots in 3 of the blocks were treated with ME + spinosad, against 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic>) dollops and the other two plots of these 3 blocks were treated with TA + TML + spinosad dollops (against 
 <italic>Ceratitis</italic> species). Each plot received 360 g divided over 120 dollops. All plots in the fourth block were treated with dollops of ME alone without insecticide, which served as control plots. Dollops were applied in caps of water bottles and tied to branches of guava trees, which were removed once a week for assessing population levels. Four different monitoring traps (CML + spinosad, TML + spinosad, ME + spinosad &amp; ME alone) were deployed in all plots and population levels were assessed each week. The experiment was conducted during 35 weeks between 2014-11-19 and 2015-07-22.
