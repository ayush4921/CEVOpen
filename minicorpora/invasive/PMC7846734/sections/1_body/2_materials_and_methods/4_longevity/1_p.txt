0: For estimates of the field life of ME + spinosad, experiments were conducted in Arba Minch between 2015-09-18 and 2016-04-20.
1: Dollops of approximately 3 g of SPLAT containing 20% ME & 2% spinosad were aged on mango leaves in the lower shaded part of a canopy of a mango tree for 1, 7, 15 and 30 days prior to the experiment.
2: At the start of the experiment, leaves containing treatments from each application date were detached from the mango tree and placed inside modified traps, which consisted of a transparent water bottle (1.5 L) cut in half and inverted, with two fly entry holes (~ 7 mm, diam.).
3: The fruit flies could easily enter through the holes, but we limited the entry hole to 7 mm so that flies did not readily exit the traps before the spinosad took effect.
4: For the sake of determining the effect of aging on the relative attractiveness, baited traps containing the differently aged treatments were hung in proximity of each other (at 1 m distance, under the same mango tree canopy).
5: In a separate experiment, we assessed how long a lure could be effective in attracting and suppressing the male population.
6: In this experiment we placed baited traps containing the differently aged treatments at 30 m distance from each other to get a relatively independent measure of the rate of attraction of each differently aged lure.
7: In both experiments trap position was rotated between replicates.
8: Captures were evaluated after 24 h.
