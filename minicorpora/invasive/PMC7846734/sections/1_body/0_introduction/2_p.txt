0: The family Tephritidae includes several polyphagous fruit fly pests, some of which have spread outside their native range and become invasive 2,  3,  10,  11.
1: Human activities and global trade of agricultural produce have played an important role in introducing alien fruit fly species into new regions 12.
2: Many of these regions, however, already had indigenous or other invasive tephritid fruit fly species affecting agricultural production 2.
3: As a result, an invasive species may create a competitive challenge in the established resident community.
4: In the last two decades several fruit fly species of Asian origin have invaded sub-Saharan Africa threatening fruit and vegetable production 13.
5: Of these, the species with arguably the biggest impact in the region is the Oriental fruit fly,  Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel), which was incidentally detected in Kenya in 2003 during routine fruit fly surveillance 14.
6: Since its detection, the pest has spread rapidly throughout the continent, causing serious damage in both large commercial enterprises, as well as in small-scale fruit production areas 15  17 and displacing native tephritids, such as  Ceratitis cosyra (Walker) and  Ceratitis capitata (Wiedermann) 3.
