0: Fruit damage due to the native tephritid fruit fly species in East Africa was already high, causing serious problems to growers.
1: This situation was exacerbated with the invasion of  B. dorsalis, with damage frequently reaching 100% in the absence of effective pest management 3,  18,  19.
2: This highly invasive species has since displaced local fruit fly species from smallholder crops 3.
3: The relative economic impact is perhaps strongest felt by smallholder farming families that count on the small-scale sales of high-value crops to significantly contribute to the family economics.
4: Pest management and control strategies should thus be amenable to both large-scale productions and small-scale farming, with emphasis on the latter.
5: However, little is known about the potential of adoption and utilization of fruit fly control techniques in smallholder farming settings.
