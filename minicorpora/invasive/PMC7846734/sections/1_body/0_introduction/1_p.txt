0: Organisms that share resources in an ecosystem are often in direct or indirect competition, affecting each others fecundity, growth and survival 1.
1: Arrival of an invasive exotic species could increase competition to such a degree that it may cause competitive displacement of native species 2  4.
2: Numerous behavioral, physiological and ecological factors determine the success of an alien species in a new geographic area 5,  6.
3: Efficiency in resource utilization, rapid population growth and short reproduction cycles, low pressure of natural enemies, high dispersal ability, and phenotypic plasticity are among the traits frequently observed to favor an invasive alien species over indigenous guilds 7  9.
