0: Various management techniques exist that can be used in fruit fly suppression, of which orchard sanitation and toxic bait sprays (e.g.
1: GF-120 17), are mainstays.
2: Of the upcoming techniques that have a good potential of adoption by the East African farming community is the use of male attractants in a form called male annihilation technique (MAT), which selectively removes males from a population and thereby reduces the percentage of fertile females and oviposition.
3: The technique makes use of the fact that males of many tephritid fruit flies are strongly attracted to certain chemical compounds, the ecological importance and evolutionary origin of which is only partially understood 20.
4: These male-specific attractants, frequently referred to as parapheromones, can be used in combination with killing agents, such as spinosad, to reduce a population from a given area through male annihilation 21.
5: Males of  B. dorsalis are highly attracted to methyl eugenol (ME), whereas the native  C. capitata, as well as some other  Ceratitis species, are attracted to trimedlure (TML) and terpinyl acetate (TA) 20.
6: Success of MAT in control of fruit flies has been mainly reported for those species of males that respond very strongly to male lures.
7: ME-based MAT has been successfully used to eradicate or significantly suppress  B. dorsalis flies 21  23.
8: Although Ceratitis male lures (TML & TA) are less attractive compared to ME, potential use of these male lures for  Ceratitis spp in MAT has been reported in Africa and Hawaii 24,  25.
