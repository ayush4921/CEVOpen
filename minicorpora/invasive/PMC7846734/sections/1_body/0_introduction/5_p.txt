0: In this study, the overarching goal was to understand what the possibilities and constraints are of fruit fly intervention in smallholder farms compared to large farms.
1: Factors that were assessed included competitive displacement, competitive release, the dispersive capability of flies and the longevity of the lures.
2: Using ME-based fruit fly intervention in both large-scale and small-scale orchards, we evaluated the rate and range of dispersal of male  B. dorsalis.
3: Further, we assessed if selective suppression of the invasive  B. dorsalis using ME could cause competitive release of displaced native tephritid species, through measuring capture composition of traps pre and post intervention, as well as the composition of fruit flies emerging from various fruit species.
4: The results are important for designing intervention campaigns in smallholder and large farms.
