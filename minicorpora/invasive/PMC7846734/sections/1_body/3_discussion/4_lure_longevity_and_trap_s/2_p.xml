<p id="Par36">It should be noted that, although the captures declined with ageing, this may also have been in part due to degradation of Spinosad in the bait and not only because of loss of methyl eugenol from the dollop, as flies exit traps that do not contain Spinosad-laced baits. Regardless of the decline, attract-and-kill may still work well over prolonged time if dollops are applied at higher density. With ageing the lower range of attraction of dollops with attenuated ME strengths could be compensated for by a higher application density. From an application perspective, further studies should aim at estimating the range of attraction, and ways to minimize decline in attractiveness of dollops over time and estimate the economic viability of these strategies.</p>
