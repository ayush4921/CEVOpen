<p id="Par32">Whereas we deployed lures that target multiple species, 
 <italic>C. capitata</italic> appeared not to be suppressed much during the trial. There may be several reasons for this. First, trimedlure is a much less potent attractant for 
 <italic>C. capitata</italic> than methyl eugenol for 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic>. In addition, unlike 
 <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> which readily feed on ME

 <italic>Ceratitis</italic> spp are not known to feed on male lures

The addition of a phagostimulant (sugar) to the bait was aimed at increasing feeding and thus lethal spinosad dose uptake, but perhaps in part due to the weaker attractiveness of the lure this did not suppress the population sufficiently. Because of the inability to suppress fruit flies altogether, the guava orchard was uprooted in 2016.
