 <caption> Regression of the number of recaptured B. dorsalis males on distance from the release point. . The number of recaptured flies declined with distance from release point (r 2 = 0.71, F(1,46) = 112.7, p &lt; 0.001), both when trapping started immediately after release (blue-marked flies) and when release preceded recapture by 3 days (green-marked flies). As a control, capture of unmarked flies over distance showed a weak correlation (r 2 = 0.24, F (1,44) = 13.69, p &lt; 0.001). </caption>
