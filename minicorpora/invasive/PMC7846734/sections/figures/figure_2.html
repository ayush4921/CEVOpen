 <caption> Normalized trap captures of B. dorsalis in Arba-Minch in control and treatment plots of smallholder orchards throughout the intervention period. Capture rates were expressed as a fraction of the average capture rates of that plot at the beginning of the intervention trial. Results are expressed as a square root transformed value. Local Polynomial Regression Fitting was used for smoothing the curves. </caption>
