Novel sustainable control methods need testing against the backdrop of smallholder-dominated farming of Africa. We evaluated the potential of male-specific attractants (parapheromones) laced with insecticide to suppress the alien invasive <italic>Bactrocera dorsalis</italic> and native <italic>Ceratitis capitata</italic>. In large-scale guava, methyl-eugenol (ME)-bait stations combined with toxic protein baits suppressed <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> within 8&#x000a0;months but resulted in a resurgence of the displaced <italic>Ceratitis capitata</italic>. In smallholder farms, intervention using SPLAT-ME laced with spinosad was surprisingly unsuccessful. Subsequent mark-release-recapture experiments showed high dispersal rates of flies, covering many times a typical farm size, leading to a continuous influx of flies from surrounding areas. Several other factors important for intervention were evaluated. SPLAT-MAT-ME dollops remained attractive for over two weeks, although gradually becoming less attractive than fresh baits. Further, competitive displacement was observed: <italic>C. capitata</italic> selectively emerged from fruits in which <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> infestation was low. Finally, we evaluated whether ME could be combined with <italic>C. capitata</italic> male attractants [trimedlure (TML) and terpinyl acetate (TA)] without affecting attraction. Combining male lures did not affect catches directly, although at very high populations of <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> attracted to ME interfered with <italic>C. capitata</italic> trap entry. Although ME-based methods can effectively suppress <italic>B. dorsalis</italic>, they were not effective at single smallholder scale due to the high dispersive propensity of tephritids. Further, competitive release implies the need for a combination of lures and methods. These observations are important for developing control schemes tailored for African smallholder settings.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Chemical biology</kwd><kwd>Chemical ecology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Formas, Linnaeus grant</institution></funding-source><award-id>ICE3</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsr&#x000e5;det</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2012-156</award-id><award-id>2016-05660</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herrera</surname><given-names>Sebastian Larsson</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open Access funding provided by Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences.</p></open-access></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Swedish University of</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open Access funding provided by Swedish University of</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2021</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Organisms that share resources in an ecosystem are often in direct or indirect competition, affecting each other&#x02019;s fecundity, growth and survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.

Human activities and global trade of agricultural produce have played an important role in introducing alien fruit fly species into new regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Many of these regions, however, already had indigenous or other invasive tephritid fruit fly species affecting agricultural production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. As a result, an invasive species may create a competitive challenge in the established resident community. In the last two decades several fruit fly species of Asian origin have invaded sub-Saharan Africa threatening fruit and vegetable production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Of these, the species with arguably the biggest impact in the region is the Oriental fruit fly, <italic>Bactrocera dorsalis</italic> (Hendel), which was incidentally detected in Kenya in 2003 during routine fruit fly surveillance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Since its detection, the pest has spread rapidly throughout the continent, causing serious damage in both large commercial enterprises, as well as in small-scale fruit production areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and displacing native tephritids, such as <italic>Ceratitis cosyra</italic> (Walker) and <italic>Ceratitis capitata</italic> (Wiedermann)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Fruit damage due to the native tephritid fruit fly species in East Africa was already high, causing serious problems to growers. This situation was exacerbated with the invasion of <italic>B. dorsalis</italic>, with damage frequently reaching 100% in the absence of effective pest management<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. This highly invasive species has since displaced local fruit fly species from smallholder crops<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The relative economic impact is perhaps strongest felt by smallholder farming families that count on the small-scale sales of high-value crops to significantly contribute to the family economics. Pest management and control strategies should thus be amenable to both large-scale productions and small-scale farming, with emphasis on the latter. However, little is known about the potential of adoption and utilization of fruit fly control techniques in smallholder farming settings.</p><p id="Par5">Various management techniques exist that can be used in fruit fly suppression, of which orchard sanitation and toxic bait sprays (e.g. GF-120<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>), are mainstays. Of the upcoming techniques that have a good potential of adoption by the East African farming community is the use of male attractants in a form called male annihilation technique (MAT), which selectively removes males from a population and thereby reduces the percentage of fertile females and oviposition. The technique makes use of the fact that males of many tephritid fruit flies are strongly attracted to certain chemical compounds, the ecological importance and evolutionary origin of which is only partially understood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. These male-specific attractants, frequently referred to as parapheromones, can be used in combination with killing agents, such as spinosad, to reduce a population from a given area through male annihilation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Males of <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> are highly attracted to methyl eugenol (ME), whereas the native <italic>C. capitata</italic>, as well as some other <italic>Ceratitis</italic> species, are attracted to trimedlure (TML) and terpinyl acetate (TA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Success of MAT in control of fruit flies has been mainly reported for those species of males that respond very strongly to male lures. ME-based MAT has been successfully used to eradicate or significantly suppress <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> flies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Although Ceratitis male lures (TML &#x00026; TA) are less attractive compared to ME, potential use of these male lures for <italic>Ceratitis</italic> spp in MAT has been reported in Africa and Hawaii<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">In this study, the overarching goal was to understand what the possibilities and constraints are of fruit fly intervention in smallholder farms compared to large farms. Factors that were assessed included competitive displacement, competitive release, the dispersive capability of flies and the longevity of the lures. Using ME-based fruit fly intervention in both large-scale and small-scale orchards, we evaluated the rate and range of dispersal of male <italic>B. dorsalis</italic>. Further, we assessed if selective suppression of the invasive <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> using ME could cause competitive release of displaced native tephritid species, through measuring capture composition of traps pre and post intervention, as well as the composition of fruit flies emerging from various fruit species. The results are important for designing intervention campaigns in smallholder and large farms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Selective suppression of <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> in large-scale farming setting leads to competitive release of <italic>C. capitata</italic></title><p id="Par22">In 2013 the population of <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> in UAAIE was very high, to the extent that a single ME trap captured thousands of male flies in less than 30&#x000a0;min in an area bordering a guava orchard (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> inset).

The lack of suppression could be due to the relatively small size of the fields and the diverse cropping systems, which provide for alternative hosts for <italic>B. dorsalis</italic>. In addition, a continuous immigration of <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> from neighboring fields could have underlined the lack of control.

To collect males for marking, modified traps were constructed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> middle inset), such that male flies could be collected with ME without them contacting the lure. Collected flies were immobilized by placing the buckets in iceboxes for 30&#x02013;40&#x000a0;min and counted. Flies were marked by spraying one of two different colors (blue &#x00026; green) of readmission ink (Blak-Ray UVP Inc, Upland California, USA). After marking, the flies were allowed to leave the bucket for one hour between 1500 and 1600&#x000a0;h. Flies that did not take off were counted and subtracted from the total number of flies released. The MRR experiment was designed in order to assess the magnitude of dispersal of the fruit flies. Eight traps were used in the release plot, while five traps were placed in each of seven other plots and five traps were placed as far away as 1&#x000a0;km from the release point to assess long range dispersal. Two colors were used to assess the dispersal of flies. A group of green-marked flies was released, followed by blue-marked flies three days later. Seventy-two hours after the release of the green-marked flies, methyl eugenol-baits were deployed to recapture dispersed flies. We argued that if we would place ME traps directly after release, dispersal would have been inhibited. So, the green marked flies (released before traps were deployed) served for getting a potentially more accurate measure of the dispersion rate, giving flies the time to disperse first, while the blue marked flies would, we assumed, result in a higher recapture rate. The releases of marked flies were repeated three times with a month interval between 2016-08-25 and 2016-04-22. For each set of release trap captures were analyzed every 5&#x000a0;days for 30&#x000a0;days.

At the start of the experiment, leaves containing treatments from each application date were detached from the mango tree and placed inside modified traps, which consisted of a transparent water bottle (1.5 L) cut in half and inverted, with two fly entry holes (~&#x02009;7&#x000a0;mm, diam.). The fruit flies could easily enter through the holes, but we limited the entry hole to 7&#x000a0;mm so that flies did not readily exit the traps before the spinosad took effect. For the sake of determining the effect of aging on the relative attractiveness, baited traps containing the differently aged treatments were hung in proximity of each other (at 1&#x000a0;m distance, under the same mango tree canopy). In a separate experiment, we assessed how long a lure could be effective in attracting and suppressing the male population. In this experiment we placed baited traps containing the differently aged treatments at 30&#x000a0;m distance from each other to get a relatively independent measure of the rate of attraction of each differently aged lure.

Their efforts anticipated our trial using SPLAT-ME, which could therefore not be carried out. Nevertheless, the data collected during the intervention by UAAIE management demonstrates that it is possible to suppress this highly invasive pest. Yet, although the suppression reduced <italic>B. dorsalis</italic>, it caused a resurgence of native <italic>C. capitata</italic> within a few months, a species that was rarely caught post invasion of <italic>B. dorsalis</italic>. This indicates that removal of one species (<italic>B. dorsalis</italic>) can cause competitive release of the replaced species (<italic>C. capitata</italic>), a phenomenon well described in other production systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.

There may be several reasons for this. First, trimedlure is a much less potent attractant for <italic>C. capitata</italic> than methyl eugenol for <italic>B. dorsalis</italic>. In addition, unlike <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> which readily feed on ME<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, <italic>Ceratitis</italic> spp are not known to feed on male lures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. The addition of a phagostimulant (sugar) to the bait was aimed at increasing feeding and thus lethal spinosad dose uptake, but perhaps in part due to the weaker attractiveness of the lure this did not suppress the population sufficiently. Because of the inability to suppress fruit flies altogether, the guava orchard was uprooted in 2016.</p><p id="Par33">Intervention trials in smallholder farms in Arba Minch did not result in suppression of the target pest <italic>B. dorsalis</italic>. We infer from our mark-release-recapture data that a main contributing factor to this failure was the high likelihood of <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> to disperse the distance of many smallholder plots, and the availability of several hosts in smallholder settings (see below). It is also important to note that in the smallholder farming area no other concerted management efforts were rolled out against fruit flies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Mark-release-recapture</title><p id="Par34">For any intervention method it is critical to know not only its efficacy in suppressing the resident population, but also the extent of immigration of the pest from neighboring areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. This is particularly true for mating disruption-based methods, in which the damaging sex (the female) is only indirectly affected by removing the non-damaging sex (male)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. In such cases, the efficacy is dependent on the extent of males or mated females moving from neighboring untreated areas into the treated area. Mark-release-recapture studies are good tools to assess this factor. For tephritid fruit flies mark-release-recapture studies have been performed in the past, and these show that flies can disperse over long distances, from 11&#x000a0;km up to 19&#x000a0;km for <italic>B. dorsalis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. However, these were done in monoculture settings with moderate winds, compared to &#x02018;calm&#x02019; weather conditions (very low wind) and complex culture systems that characterize smallholder-farming in East Africa. Furthermore, the immigration factor is critical in establishing the scale of intervention needed to ensure effective population control, which quickly exceeds the small farm size of smallholder farmers (typically less than 1&#x000a0;ha). Under the conditions tested here, including the high populations levels of <italic>B. dorsalis</italic>, the low winds and indicated temperatures, <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> readily disperses hundreds of meters in smallholder farming settings, even though fruit and food were abundantly present at and close to the release point. Considering the fact that recapture rates naturally drop with distance (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, fewer sampling points per surface area with increased distance from the release points), the relative recapture rate being as high as 60% (of the total recaptured flies) over 300&#x000a0;m and around 8% at over 1000&#x000a0;m are likely a gross underestimate of the actual fraction of flies engaging in long-range dispersion. In addition, the figures may further underestimate natural dispersion, because the capturing and marking may have affected the flies&#x02019; fitness to disperse (although low, 11% remained in the release bucket, possibly due to capturing and crowding in the bucket before release) and possibly the reduced likelihood to be recaptured using the same trap and lure (possible negative associative learning). A significant portion of male <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> thus disperses across the boundaries of a few to many smallholder plots (See Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, light-shaded areas indicating farm boundaries). This is further underlined by the fact that recapture rates of green marked flies, which were released 3 d prior to placement of the traps, were lower than those released at the same time of trap placement, particularly for traps within a 500&#x000a0;m distance from the release point, which may partly indicate that flies rapidly disperse outside the release area (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Thus, in smallholders farming areas in East Africa, fly management using male annihilation, and likely any other technique, require concerted efforts by the farmers and area-wide management strategies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. It also implies that techniques other than male annihilation, and more focused on reducing the female population, may be more appropriate for such small farm sizes. Further research should evaluate the relative dispersive capabilities of female flies, relative to males. This has not been studied in any previous study, while the impact of dispersing females is much more significant from a population dynamics and pest control perspective.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Lure longevity and trap spacing</title><p id="Par35">An important component for developing a new, sustainable lure for use in pest control is its field life. Prolonged attractiveness and the lethality reduce the need for frequent labor-intensive and expensive reapplications. In our experiments, lures indeed lost their attractiveness over time, even though ME is the most powerful male lure for tephritid species and known to attract certain species from distances, even at low doses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. When placed in a competitive setting (in close proximity to each other), trap catch gradually declined with ageing of the lure. A decline in attractiveness of ME lures was also observed in studies with other insect species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Fresh lures release higher amounts of ME than aged lures and are thus more attractive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>, as there seems no upper boundary of ME release above which the compound becomes repellent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. However, this difference may only be noticeable when traps are sampling from the same local population and thus are &#x02018;competing&#x02019; for the same flies (as in our 1-m spaced traps). Indeed, a recent study also indicated that efficacy does not necessarily increase with application density of SPLAT-MAT-ME dollops, and that above a saturation level efficacy of attract-and-kill no longer increases, or even decreases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. The same study also did not find a clear decrease in efficacy of lures of 1-d old and 14-d old lures. This is similar to what we found here, as capture rates of differently aged lures in our 30-m spaced traps experiments showed a consistent decline in capture rates of lures of more than 7&#x000a0;days old. Note also that the longevity of lures measured here may be influenced by climatic factors and thus cannot directly be translated to other climate zones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. The results also suggest that, although ME is a powerful attractant, the range of attraction of ME may be less than 30&#x000a0;m. As this is an indirect inference from the data, however, detailed studies are needed to examine the exact range of attraction.</p><p id="Par36">It should be noted that, although the captures declined with ageing, this may also have been in part due to degradation of Spinosad in the bait and not only because of loss of methyl eugenol from the dollop, as flies exit traps that do not contain Spinosad-laced baits. Regardless of the decline, attract-and-kill may still work well over prolonged time if dollops are applied at higher density. With ageing the lower range of attraction of dollops with attenuated ME strengths could be compensated for by a higher application density. From an application perspective, further studies should aim at estimating the range of attraction, and ways to minimize decline in attractiveness of dollops over time and estimate the economic viability of these strategies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Competitive displacement of <italic>C. capitata</italic> by the invasive <italic>B. dorsalis</italic></title><p id="Par37">Species with a similar ecological niche can coexist through resource partitioning. The strength of interspecific competition is dependent on the variety of available host fruits that competing pests can utilize<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. The intercropping of various hosts in the smallholder orchards likely provides opportunities for partition resources of competing Tephritidae species. Interestingly, in smallholder farms the invasive <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> was mainly collected from recently introduced mango varieties such as &#x02018;Kent&#x02019; and &#x02018;Tommy Atkins&#x02019;, whereas <italic>C. capitata</italic> flies were mainly collected from local mango and orange, from which few <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> emerged. This suggests that <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> competitive displaced <italic>C. capitata</italic> fly onto fruit less preferred by the first (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The complex array of different host species, and of varieties within a species, that typifies smallholder farming plots in East Africa may create more competition-free niches that allow for coexistence of several tephritid species in the same location. In fact, in spite of the high infestation levels of <italic>B. dorsalis</italic>, several other species besides <italic>C. capitata</italic>, were continuously captured in smallholder plots, albeit in low numbers. In contrast, the various <italic>Ceratitis</italic> spp. that challenged production in the large monoculture guava plots at UAAIE prior to <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> invasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, completely disappeared from monitoring traps placed in guava at the start of intervention in 2013, except for <italic>C. capitata</italic>. This may be circumstantial evidence for niche differentiation in the smallholder plots, and absence thereof in the large-scale plots. In La R&#x000e9;union, despite niche overlap with other tephritid pests, <italic>C. capitata</italic> was found to uniquely exploit certain hosts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. Similarly, Vargas et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, found that in spite of competitive displacement by <italic>B. dorsalis</italic>, <italic>C. capitata</italic> remained dominant in coffee plantations, which is considered a non-host for <italic>B. dorsalis</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Interaction of male lures and trap interference</title><p id="Par38">As our field observations indicated that suppression of one pest species can lead to a resurgence of another pest species that occupies the same niche, fruit fly management should target all species in the guild to achieve an effective crop protection. Since different tephritid species are attracted to different male attractants, it would seem logical and economical to combine lures in the same dispenser. We verified possible interactions due to combining such lures (TA and TML, attractant of <italic>C. capitata</italic>, among other species, and ME attractant of <italic>B. dorsalis</italic>). The efficacy of combining male specific lures has been reported to be variable, depending on population density of the interacting species and locality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. As no lure interaction was noted in large-scale farms, we suspect that the very high populations of <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> in smallholder farms suppressed trap entry and catches of <italic>Ceratitis</italic>. Indeed, in Arba-Minch many <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> males were seen on the outside of the trap, which probably interfered with trap entry of <italic>C. capitata</italic>, particularly since ME is a much stronger male attractant for <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> than TML is for <italic>C. capitata</italic>. We therefore cannot confirm that different male lures influence trap catches of either species when placed in the same trap, which has been reported in the literature. For instance, Vargas et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup> reported that traps baited with the combination of 50% ME and 50% cuelure (another male lure attractive to certain tephritid species) were equally attractive to <italic>Zeugodacus cucurbitae</italic> as traps baited with cuelure alone, while other reports showed negative or synergistic interactions between these<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par39">We demonstrated that in large-scale farming settings in East Africa, male lures in combination with other semiochemical management tools can effectively suppress the invasive <italic>B. dorsalis</italic>. However, the risk of resurgence of native fruit fly pests, including <italic>C. capitata</italic>, illustrates the need for combinatorial tools that target multiple Tephritidae species.</p><p id="Par40">In our smallholder orchards, where the native fruit fly <italic>C. capitata</italic> had been largely displaced by <italic>B. dorsalis</italic>, application of ME-based attract-and-kill technique did not suppress <italic>B. dorsalis</italic> to manageable levels, in part due to the species&#x02019; long dispersive range. Controlling tephritid pests in a smallholder-farming setting thus requires concerted efforts from farming communities to achieve areawide management. Further, the complex and diverse cropping systems in smallholder farms may offer competition-free space for a more diverse fruit fly guild, thereby increasing the risk for competitive release and requiring intervention that targets multiple species.</p><p id="Par41">Whereas previously pest issues were &#x02018;resolved&#x02019; using broad-spectrum insecticides, the current roll-back of these products offers opportunities for novel and more sustainable alternatives. However, these methods are almost invariably more knowledge-intensive and require studies to assess if, how, and under which conditions, they can provide sustainable control and secure food production and economic growth. We hope that the current study contributed to this, particularly for African smallholder and large-scale farming settings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><sec id="Sec25"><p>
