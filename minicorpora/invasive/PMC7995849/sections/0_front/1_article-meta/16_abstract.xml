 <p>The complete chloroplast genome sequence of wild sea mallow 
  <italic>Malva wigandii</italic> (=
  <italic>Lavatera maritima</italic>) was determined and characterized in this study. The genome is 158,162 bp long, containing a pair of inverted repeats regions (IRs) of 25,166 bp, which are separated by a large single-copy region of 86,860 bp and a small single-copy region of 20,970 bp. The sea mallow chloroplast genome has 131 known genes, including 85 protein-coding genes, eight ribosomal 
  <italic>RNA</italic> genes, and 37 
  <italic>tRNA</italic> genes. The phylogenomic analysis showed that 
  <italic>M. wigandii</italic> forms a cluster with 
  <italic>Althaea officinalis</italic> with a strong bootstrap support and is sister to sequences belonging to the tribe Gossypieae. All of them are grouped in a lineage with other members of the subfamily Malvoideae. This newly sequenced chloroplast genome sequence provides useful genetic information to explore the origin and evolution of the Mediterranean radiation that gave rise to the generic alliance of 
  <italic>Malva</italic>.
