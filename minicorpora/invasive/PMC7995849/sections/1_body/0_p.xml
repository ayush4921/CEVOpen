<p>The generic alliance of 
 <italic>Malva</italic> encompasses four genera and approximately 60 species grouped in a clade belonging in the tribe Malveae (Malvacae). The alliance has its center of diversity in the Mediterranean region and in some invasive weeds – e.g. 
 <italic>Malva parviflora</italic>, 
 <italic>Malva neglecta-</italic>, found in crops from temperate regions around the world. One of the main genomic signatures of this group of species is the frequent occurrence of polyploidy, with species ranging from diploid to 16x level of ploidy (Escobar García et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). The study of the chloroplast genomes and their interactions with the nuclear genome is of particular interest specially to determine the origin of allopolyploids present in the genus 
 <italic>Malva</italic>.
