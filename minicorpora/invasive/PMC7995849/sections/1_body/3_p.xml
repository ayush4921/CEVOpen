<p>The plastome of 
 <italic>M. wigandii</italic> has 158,162 bp, exhibiting a typical genome structure common to families in the order Malvales. It possesses a pair of inverted repeat regions (IRa and IRb) of 25,166 bp, a large single copy region of 88,860 bp, and a small single copy region of 20,970 bp. The G + C content of the whole plastome is 37.1%. There are 131 genes, including 85 protein-coding, eight rRNA, and 37 tRNA, seven of which are in the IR. Among the detected genes, 11 have one or two introns. The phylogenetic tree recovers three lineages within the subfamily Malvoideae, corresponding to the three tribes recognized: Malveae, Gossypieae, and Hibisceae, establishing a sister position between Gossypieae and Malveae, in which the genus 
 <italic>Malva</italic> is included as predicted by a nuclear phylogeny (Tate et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). An interesting trend observed is that while in the late-diverging tribe Malveae the 
 <italic>ycf1</italic> portion included in IRb is just 2–3 bp long, in early diverging tribes Gossypieae and Hibisceae is 79–83 and above 600 bp long, respectively. The genes with the highest number of polymorphic sites for the species examined are 
 <italic>ycf1</italic>, 
 <italic>rpoC2</italic>, 
 <italic>ndhF</italic>, 
 <italic>trnK</italic>, 
 <italic>matK</italic>, and 
 <italic>rpoB.</italic>
