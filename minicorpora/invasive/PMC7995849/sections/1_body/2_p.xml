<p>Leaf samples were sampled from the living collection at the Real Jardín Botánico-CSIC, Madrid, Spain (40°24′36.2′′N 3°41′20.1′′W) (accession #04803.19). Total genomic DNA was extracted with QIAGEN DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Manchester, UK). Two pair-ended 150-bp libraries were prepared with TruSeq DNA PCR-Free kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) and sequenced with Illumina HiSeqX. Read assembly was performed with NOVOPlasty (Dierckxsens et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) and 
 <italic>Althaea officinalis</italic> (GenBank NC034701) as reference. The consensus chloroplast genome was examined for depth with bowtie2 
 <italic>via</italic> Geneious Prime (Kearse et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Annotation was performed with PLANN (Huang and Cronk 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) using 
 <italic>Hibiscus rosa-sinensis</italic> MK382984 as reference and the plastome drawn with OGDRAW (Greiner et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). We used ECuADOR (Carrion et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) to identify limits between inverted repeat (IR) regions of 
 <italic>M. wigandii</italic> and a set of 10 representative species for phylogenetic analysis and IRs junctions were visualized with IRScope (Amiryousefi et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). MAFFT version 7 (Katoh and Standley 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) was used to align sequences and the phylogenetic reconstruction using maximum likelihood (ML) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>) under a TVM + F + I + G4 model in IQ-TREE1 (Nguyen et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) run on CIPRES (Miller et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).
