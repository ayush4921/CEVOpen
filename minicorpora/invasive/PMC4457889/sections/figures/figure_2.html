 <caption> Plot-level odds of (a) R. multiflora and (b) B. thunbergii occurrence and (c) plot-level log odds of finding multiple invasive species. A total of 4388 10-m diameter plots with different land-use histories in a deciduous forest in eastern North America were included in this analysis except in the invasive species count analysis in which only plots with at least one invasive species were included (n = 792). The odds of occurrence for each invasive species in a given land-use category relative to always forested plots is given by each point with 95% confidence intervals. Sample sizes are given in parentheses. Among land-use histories, always forested plots (i.e. forested continuously since at least 1939) was used as the reference group and asterisks indicate a significant difference from always forested plots (* p &lt; 0.05, **p &lt; 0.01, ***p &lt; 0.001). </caption>
