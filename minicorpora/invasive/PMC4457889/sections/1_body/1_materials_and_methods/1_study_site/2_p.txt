0: Although PNR is currently predominantly forested, the region has experienced a variety of anthropogenic disturbances.
1: As with most forests in the eastern U.S., much of the reserve was logged in the 1800s.
2: The majority of the reserve returned to forest afterward although a small fraction of the reserve experienced more recent clear cutting in the 1960s and became forested later.
3: Following logging, parts of the property were used for agriculture until the early to mid-1900s.
4: In addition, surface mining for coal occurred during the 1940s.
5: Little development (e.g., building) has taken place since PNR was designated as a nature reserve and became a part of Carnegie Museum of Natural History in 1956.
6: At present, most of the PNR remains forested and undisturbed with its east boundary connected to the 200-ha Laurel Mountain State Park.
7: However, a high level of anthropogenic disturbance (e.g., residential areas and highways) has occurred to the west side of the reserve, which could have accelerated the introduction and establishment of invasive species.
8: No special permission was required to measure woody plants on private property and no protected species were involved in the survey.
9: This study was approved by the Director of Powdermill Nature Reserve and by the Director of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History.
