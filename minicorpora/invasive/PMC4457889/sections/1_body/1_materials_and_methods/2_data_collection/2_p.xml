<p>To document the various anthropogenic disturbances that have occurred at PNR, we used historical aerial images to assign land-use history categories to each vegetation plot. Aerial images were available from 1939, 1957, 1967, 1993, and 2006 [
 <xref rid="pone.0128161.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We classified types of land-use history using the standard national land cover database classification system [
 <xref rid="pone.0128161.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], which includes forest land, shrub land, planted/cultivated, and barren (including surface mining). Historical mining activities inside the property were matched with the aerial imaging. We ultimately classified each plot into one of the following six categories based on previous anthropogenic disturbances and current conditions (as suggested by Mosher et al. 2009 [
 <xref rid="pone.0128161.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]): always forested (since at least 1939), agriculture to forest, mined to forest (all mining was surface mining for coal), logged to forest, developed to forest, and always developed (
