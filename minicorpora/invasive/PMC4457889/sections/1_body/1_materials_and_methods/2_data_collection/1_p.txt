0: During the summers of 2006, 2007, and 2008, a continuous 120m x 120m grid was mapped across PNR (for a total of 647 'blocks').
1: Within each block, nine circular vegetation plots (10m in radius, ~314 m 2 in area, total area = 2827 m 2) were established in a square around the center of each block.
2: Within each vegetation plot, all trees, shrubs, and herbs were surveyed.
3: Shrub and herb abundance was assessed as percent cover (cover class hereafter) and assigned a numeric value between 0 and 6 (0, trace = 1, 110% = 2, 1125% = 3, 2650% = 4, 5175% = 5, and >75% = 6).
4: Based on cover class assignments,  R.  multiflora and  B.  thunbergii cover in each plot was binned into a low cover category (trace-10% cover, hereafter low abundance) and a high cover category (>10% cover, hereafter high abundance).
