0: Current human disturbance (e.g., buildings, yards, and trails) within a 10m radius of each plot was noted.
1: Among the plots with a history of development, ~58% of them were open space with minimal construction materials (e.g., lawn grass) that later became forested.
2: The rest of the plots had impervious surfaces accounting for 5079% of the total cover (e.g., buildings).
3: Distances from each plot to roads and forest edge were calculated in the ArcGIS software program [ 21].
