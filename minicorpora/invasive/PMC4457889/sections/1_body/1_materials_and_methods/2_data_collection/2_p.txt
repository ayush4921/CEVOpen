0: To document the various anthropogenic disturbances that have occurred at PNR, we used historical aerial images to assign land-use history categories to each vegetation plot.
1: Aerial images were available from 1939, 1957, 1967, 1993, and 2006 [ 19].
2: We classified types of land-use history using the standard national land cover database classification system [ 20], which includes forest land, shrub land, planted/cultivated, and barren (including surface mining).
3: Historical mining activities inside the property were matched with the aerial imaging.
4: We ultimately classified each plot into one of the following six categories based on previous anthropogenic disturbances and current conditions (as suggested by Mosher et al.
5: 2009 [ 5]): always forested (since at least 1939), agriculture to forest, mined to forest (all mining was surface mining for coal), logged to forest, developed to forest, and always developed ( Fig 1a).
6: Many of these land-use history categories represent patterns of secondary succession common throughout the eastern U.S.A.
