0: Five invasive plant species were identified in the survey plots at PNR.
1: Multiflora rose ( Rosa multiflora) and Japanese barberry ( Berberis thunbergii) were widespread in the reserve (accounting for 65% and 34% of all invasive species occurrences, respectively), while the three remaining species combined accounted for<1.5% of invasive species coverage ( Lonicera morrowi,  Alliaria petiolata, and  Celastrus orbiculatus,  Fig 1).
2: Only  R.  multiflora and  B.  thunbergii had sufficient sample sizes to be analyzed individually.
3: All five invasive species were included for a third analysis assessing impacts of land-use history on the general occurrence of invasive species within PNR.
