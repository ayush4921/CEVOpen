0: Several studies have implicated past land use as a major factor in the establishment and spread of invasive plant species [ 1][ 2][ 3][ 4].
1: Changes in land use, such as clearing land for agriculture and then subsequent reforestation, often create windows of opportunity for invasive species to establish in these disturbed areas [ 1].
2: Agriculture, logging, and residential or commercial development all typically increase the distribution of invasive plants, although this depends on the species in question and land use seems to have more of an effect on occurrence than on abundance [ 1][ 2][ 3][ 5].
3: Additionally, past land use is more predictive of invasive occurrence and abundance than present land use [ 1][ 2], but the best predictor of distribution may be found by combining past and present land use into a single metric of land-use change [ 5], which is rarely done.
