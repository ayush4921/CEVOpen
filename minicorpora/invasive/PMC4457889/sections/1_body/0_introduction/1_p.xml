<p>A variety of factors determine whether a biological community is particularly susceptible to invasion, including soil nutrients, light levels, disturbance regime, and land-use history [
 <xref rid="pone.0128161.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, some questions remain as to how these factors interact and, in particular, how both the ability of a species to invade and its population abundance once it establishes are influenced by land-use history. The effects of some types of land use on invasive species establishment and spread have been studied in greater detail than others and most studies do not include the effects of distance to road or consider the combined effects of past and current land use.
