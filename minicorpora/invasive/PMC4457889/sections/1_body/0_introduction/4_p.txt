0: Roads may also aid the spread of invasive species, even in areas that have historically been forested [ 12][ 13].
1: Roads provide suitable habitats for invasive species as well as corridors for the dispersal of invasive species [ 12][ 14].
2: However, only a few studies have combined models of invasive species presence and distance to roads with land-use history to examine whether roads continue to be important predictors of invasive spread when land use is included in the model and  vice versa [ 2][ 15][ 16].
3: It is important to include both land use and distance to roads in models because the land use history and roads could potentially have interacting effects.
4: For instance, a road close to a disturbed site could increase propagule pressure in that site [ 4].
5: The handful of studies that have made this comparison have found inconsistent results [ 2][ 15][ 16], potentially due to species-specific differences in the effects of roads on the occurrence and spread of invasive species [ 17].
