0: Prosopis juliflora (Swartz DC.
1: ), hereafter referred to as  Prosopis, has been introduced to different parts of the world with the aim of providing benefits to rural people, such as the production of fuelwood, charcoal, or construction material (Engda,  2009; Haji & Mohammed,  2013; Mureriwa, Adam, Sahu, & Tesfamichael,  2016; Pasiecznik & Henry Doubleday Research Association,  2001).
2: Like numerous other introduced plants,  Prosopis has become invasive in many places and is increasingly known for its negative ecological and socioeconomic impacts (Shackleton, Le Maitre, van Wilgen et al.,  2015a; Shackleton, Le Maitre, van Wilgen et al.,  2015b; van Wilgen & Wannenburgh,  2016).
3: In Ethiopia, several studies have attempted to assess  Prosopis distribution particularly in the Afar Region (Ayanu et al.,  2014; Engda,  2009; Wakie et al.,  2014), but they either focused on relatively small study areas or provided only coarseresolution maps of either presence or absence of the species.
4: Yet, at the early stage of its invasion, or at the invasion front,  Prosopis often occurs in a patchy mixture with natural vegetation or as single trees, which is challenging to capture by remotely sensed data of moderate spatial resolution.
5: Hence, the development of effective management strategies to mitigate the negative impacts of  Prosopis requires accurate and detailed information on both invaded areas and on the level of invasion across the invaded area.
