0: We set out to compare the performances of five MLAs (gradient boosting machine implemented in two different ways, random forest, support vector machine, and deep learning neural network), an ensemble model and a generalized linear model.
1: This analysis helps identifying the bestperforming algorithm in mapping detailed fractional cover of  Prosopis in the dryland ecosystem of the Afar Region, Ethiopia.
2: All model outputs were validated using a number of performance measures.
3: The bestperforming model was then used to create a  Prosopis distribution and fractional cover map.
