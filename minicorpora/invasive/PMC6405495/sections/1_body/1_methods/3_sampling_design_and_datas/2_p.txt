0: Georeferenced field samples were collected throughout the entire study area using a stratified random sampling approach.
1: Presence and absence plots were selected from invaded and uninvaded areas, respectively.
2: Invaded areas were additionally stratified into heavily invaded and less invaded areas.
3: Within those strata, careful attention was paid to collect representative samples of the entire cover gradient (0%100%) of  Prosopis coverage.
4: In order to reduce spatial autocorrelation, each sampling plot had a minimum distance of 500 m to the next one.
5: A total of 2,722 samples (presence and absence plots of 20 m  20 m) were collected between September 2016 and March 2017.
6: A plot was considered a presence plot if it contained at least one  Prosopis plant; otherwise, it was considered an absence plot.
7: About 70% of the samples were absence plots while 30% were presence plots.
8: These shares were chosen based on a preliminary rough estimation of the shares of uninvaded and invaded land in the study area, which would avoid any bias of results toward either presence or absence of  Prosopis (JimenezValverde & Lobo,  2007).
9: Finally, 80% of all sampling plots were randomly selected to be used for model calibration, whereas the other 20% were used for validation (Elith et al.,  2011).
