0: The spatial datasets were gathered from various sources and used as explanatory variables to run the models (Table  1).
1: Explanatory variables differed in terms of spatial resolution, projection, and time of acquisition; thus, reprojection to UTM projection and nearest neighbor spatial resampling to a pixel resolution of 15 m was applied using panchromatic band of Landsat 8.
2: The Landsat 8 (operational land imagerOLI) satellite data were acquired on 26 and 28 January as well as 11 and 20 February 2017 (paths: 167 and 168; rows: 5054).
3: In total, nine scenes were required to cover the entire study area and then mosaicked.
4: These acquisition dates match the period of field data collection and fall into the study area's dry season, when herbs and grasses are dry and most trees and bushes except  Prosopis have shed their leaves.
