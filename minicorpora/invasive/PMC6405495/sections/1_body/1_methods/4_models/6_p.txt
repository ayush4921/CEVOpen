0: The SVM can be used for classification or regression.
1: It constructs a hyperplane or set of hyperplanes in an infinitedimensional space and tries to find the optimal separating hyperplanes, that is, the planes where the separability between classes is at its maximum (Noble,  2006; Rodrigues & De la Riva,  2014).
2: The SVMs have many mathematical features that make them attractive for prediction, handle extremely highdimensional feature spaces, and identify outliers (Brown et al.,  2000; Kimothi & Dasari,  2010).
3: We varied settings for the kernel, the cost function and gamma (Supporting information Table  S1).
