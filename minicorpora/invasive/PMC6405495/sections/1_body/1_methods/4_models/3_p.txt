0: Until few years ago, multivariate linear regression was the most commonly used approach in species distribution modeling (Collingham, Wadsworth, Huntley, & Hulme,  2000; Higgins et al.,  2003; Stohlgren et al.,  2010).
1: In this study, the GLM was included to compare the performance with the MLAs (Nicholls,  1989; Getis & Ord,  1992).
2: We used backward and forward stepwise variable selection to find a parsimonious model (Pearce and Ferrier,  2000).
3: Akaike Information Criterion was used as the model performance metric (stepAIC; Higgins et al.,  2003).
