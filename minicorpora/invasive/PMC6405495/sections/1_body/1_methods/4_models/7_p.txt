0: The DNN has become very popular recently but is still sparsely used by the geoscience community (Zhang, Zhang, & Du,  2016).
1: The DNN is fully connected neural networks composed of multiple hidden layers together with nonlinear transformations and a variety of tailored architectures (Guo et al.,  2016).
2: The DNN has a capacity to analyze big data.
3: In this study, we used a feedforward neural network.
