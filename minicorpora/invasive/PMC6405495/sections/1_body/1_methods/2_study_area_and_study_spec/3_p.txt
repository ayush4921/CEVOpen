0: The study focuses on  Prosopis species.
1: Prosopis shows a wide range of ecological adaptations (from arid to tropical climate conditions) and occur along a large variety of environmental gradients (Asfaw & Thulin,  1989; Mohamed,  1997), including different soil types (from sand to heavy clays and stony soils) and a wide range of altitudes (from sea level up to 1,600 m. a.s.l: Shiferaw et al.,  2019).
2: Furthermore,  Prosopis trees are able to fix nitrogen and have deep root systems, rendering them resistant to droughts (Keller, Lodge, Lewis, & Shogren,  2009; Mohamed,  1997).
3: This has enabled  Prosopis to become one of the most successful invasive woody plant species in arid and semiarid areas.
4: Prosopis has been planted to reclaim degraded land, combat desertification, reduce soil erosion (Mishra, Crews, & Okin,  2014; Pasiecznik & Henry Doubleday Research Association,  2001; Tessema,  2012; Wakie, Evangelista, & Laituri,  2012), and manage soil salinity (ElKeblawy & AlRawai,  2007).
5: Prosopis trees originally planted in Ethiopia (Figure  1a) belong to the species  P. juliflora (Figure  1b) in the late 1970s and early 1980s with the main aim of soil and water conservation (Pasiecznik & Henry Doubleday Research Association,  2001).
6: However, since the early 1990s, its invasive nature has caused major problems in rangelands, agricultural fields, and riverbanks, and aggravating conflicts on grazing land among pastoralists (Argaw,  2015; Kebede & Coppock,  2015; Tegegn,  2008).
7: Such conflicts have been common in the Awash Basin, where  Prosopis has invaded vast areas of precious rangeland and cropland (Wakie et al.,  2012).
