<p>Fine‐scaled fractional cover maps of IAPS are a key requisite for estimating the environmental and socio‐economic impacts of IAPS and for designing spatially explicit management strategies. Our findings show that the RF regression is outperformed other algorithms and is a suitable for mapping the fractional cover of species distribution in agro‐climatic contexts similar to those of the Afar Region. While the GBM and the SVM achieved only slightly less accurate results, the GLM, the GBM‐BRT, and the DNN did not perform well when looking at sensitivity, specificity, kappa, and the AUC. Nevertheless, performances of MLAs might be different if a much larger amount of data (i.e., predictor variables) is used, or if less training data is available or if the study is done in a different agro‐ecological context. For this reason, we recommend evaluating the performances of two or more algorithms regarding the specific tasks required and the specific environmental settings prevailing in the context of plant species distributions.</p>
