<p>Further growth of seedlings was monitored at the 7th day after germination, revealing a similar inhibiting effect (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00438-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Salinity also affected negatively lateral roots growth in the nonparasitic species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00438-f002">Figure 2</xref>dâ€“f). In 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> spp. the root is highly rudimentary [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-10-00438" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and no visible differences were found or expected with salinity treatment. Seedling length (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00438-f003">Figure 3</xref>b) were decreased by over 50% at 200 mM NaCl in all species. 
 <italic>Cuscuta japonica</italic> and 
 <italic>C. sepium</italic> showed the most pronounced inhibition of growth by salinity, even at 100 mM NaCl, although these are not the most affected species in terms of germination (
