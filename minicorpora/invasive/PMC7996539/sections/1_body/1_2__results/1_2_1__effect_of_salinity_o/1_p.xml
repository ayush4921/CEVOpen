<p>Decrease in germination rate was different among the studied species. The most significant effect of salinity was observed in 
 <italic>C. campestris</italic> where decrease in germination of nearly 70% and delay up to the 5th day at 200 mM NaCl were detected (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00438-f001">Figure 1</xref>a). The inhibitory effect was nonsignificant (
 <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00438-f001">Figure 1</xref>b) or less significant (
 <italic>C. japonica</italic>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00438-f001">Figure 1</xref>c) in the other two parasitic species, where 100 and 200 mM NaCl had similar effect and caused reduction in germination by approximately 20%. Among the nonparasitic plants, both salt concentrations caused similar effect and around 40% inhibition in 
 <italic>C. arvensis</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00438-f001">Figure 1</xref>e), while in 
 <italic>I. tricolor</italic> only a short delay in germination was observed at 100 mM NaCl with an overall similar germination rate (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00438-f001">Figure 1</xref>d). In 
 <italic>C. sepium</italic> the response was similar to 
 <italic>C. campestris</italic>, although less pronounced (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00438-f001">Figure 1</xref>f)â€”20% lower germination at 100 mM and 40% lower at 200 mM NaCl as compared to controls.
