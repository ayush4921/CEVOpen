<p>The germinated seedlings of both parasitic and nonparasitic plants were further transferred to soil (with 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, serving as host for 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic>) and monitored for growth and survival rates. Salinity priming had a certain negative effect on 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic>’s ability to infect host plants and the time periods for infection and secondary stem formation. Pregermination under saline conditions reflected in longer time for attachment to host (a delay with 3–4 days) and longer time for secondary stem formation (a delay with 2–3 days). Simultaneously, about 15% of the 
 <italic>C. campestris</italic> seedlings, germinated under 100 mM NaCl and nearly 50% of those under 200 mM NaCl failed to successfully infect host plants. The effect at 100 mM NaCl was similar in 
 <italic>C. chinensis</italic> and 
 <italic>C. japonica</italic>, while at 200 mM NaCl both species failed to attach to the host. This, however, proved to be the critical developmental step for the parasite, as further development, defined as number of plants able to form secondary stem, was not impeded by salinity pretreatment. In the nonparasitic species all seedlings, transferred to soil developed and albeit at a slower rate than controls, grew successfully.
