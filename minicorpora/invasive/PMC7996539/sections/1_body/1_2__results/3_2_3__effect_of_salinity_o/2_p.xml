<p>Growth rate after transfer to saline soil or secondary stem formation on nonstressed hosts was calculated as either cm day
 <sup>−1</sup> or mg day
 <sup>−1</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00438-f006">Figure 6</xref>). It was assumed that potential hosts encountered by the parasite would be adapted to salinity and therefore not stressed, while the nonparasitic relative would be further challenged by soil salinity. A similar inhibition of growth rate at 100 and 200 mM NaCl was observed in all species. While the decrease in the nonparasitic species was within 20–30%, the effect of germination under saline conditions in 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> was higher, leading to over 70% decrease in growth rate compared to controls (
