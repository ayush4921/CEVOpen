<p>Two major classes of hydrolytic enzymes with a possible role in seeds’ storage compounds were studied at the 24th and 48th hour of germination. A total of 5 differing in molecular weight bands of amylolytic activity were detected in all studied species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00438-f004">Figure 4</xref>). The larger was distributed on the top of the separating gel and was therefore denoted as larger than 250 kDa (the highest protein standard). We do not exclude the possibility that it was composed of several α-amylase isoforms. In 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> spp. most of the amylolytic bands were more pronounced at salt treatments and during the 24th hour (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00438-f004">Figure 4</xref>a,b) with the exception of 
 <italic>C. japonica</italic>, where salt treatment seemed to inhibit amylolytic activity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00438-f004">Figure 4</xref>c). In the nonparasitic species, and especially in 
 <italic>I. tricolor</italic> and 
 <italic>C. sepium</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00438-f004">Figure 4</xref>d,f) the activity was much more uniform, but also with increase at 100 mM NaCl in comparison to controls and 200 mM NaCl-germinating seeds.
