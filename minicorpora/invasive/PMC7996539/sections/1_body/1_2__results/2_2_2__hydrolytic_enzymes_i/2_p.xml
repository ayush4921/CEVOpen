<p>Unlike amylases, the proteolytic activity in germinating seeds was significantly lower and fewer bands were detected (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00438-f005">Figure 5</xref>). A single band was detected at the 48th hour in control seeds in 
 <italic>C. campestris</italic> and 
 <italic>C. chinensis</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00438-f005">Figure 5</xref>a,b), while no protease at all was detected in 
 <italic>C. japonica</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00438-f005">Figure 5</xref>c). A similar pattern was observed in 
 <italic>Convolvulus arvensis</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00438-f005">Figure 5</xref>e), while in 
 <italic>I. tricolor</italic> activity was detected in 200 mM NaCl-germinating seeds (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00438-f005">Figure 5</xref>d). In 
 <italic>Calystegia sepium</italic>, however, proteases were activated by salinity and visible at the 24th hour (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00438-f005">Figure 5</xref>f).
