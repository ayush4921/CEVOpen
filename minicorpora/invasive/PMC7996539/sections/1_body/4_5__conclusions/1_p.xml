<p>The presented results strongly suggest high sensitivity to salinity of the parasitic plant 
 <italic>Cuscuta campestris</italic> during the early germination events and seedling growth. Although it is a highly invasive and noxious weed with broad ecological plasticity, it showed poorer tolerance to salinity, compared to its nonparasitic relative. In contrast, it is a much more effective parasite under salinity in comparison to the other two 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> species. The inability to cope with the negative effects of salt stress may be partially predetermined by the low content of storage compounds in the seeds. Such sensitivity to adverse conditions, however, may be beneficial in an ecological perspective, as lower germination and survival rate under restricted host availability could contribute to better adjustment to the available resources. The germination percentage of the nonparasitic vines was similarly affected, although their further development was less affected than the parasitic species.
