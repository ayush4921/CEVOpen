<p>The comparative analysis of parasitic and nonparasitic members of Convolvulaceae seed germination showed slower germination in the parasitic plants, further delayed by salinity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00438-f001">Figure 1</xref>), which is in conformity with the existing literature. The strategy of nonparasitic vines involves fast initial growth and climbing over other plants to outcompete surrounding species [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-10-00438" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The relatively big seeds of these species germinated as fast as possible (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00438-f001">Figure 1</xref>dâ€“f), mobilizing starch by activation of amylases (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00438-f004">Figure 4</xref>). In contrast, even when physical dormancy was artificially broken (through scarification), germination in 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> spp. was slower.
