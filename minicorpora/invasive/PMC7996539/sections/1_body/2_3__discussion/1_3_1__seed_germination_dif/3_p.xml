<p>The involvement of storage compoundsâ€™ mobilization in germinating seeds was shown to be similar in all species, activated toward the 48th hour with prevalence of amylase activity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00438-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Dependence on amylolytic activity was further increased by salinity and especially relevant for the parasitic plant, where the highest activity was observed under salinity, already activated in the first 24 h under 100 mM NaCl, with a delay toward the 48th hour under 200 mM NaCl (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00438-f004">Figure 4</xref>). This pattern suggests an increased role of stored starch in 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> germination under suboptimal conditions, but also fast depletion of the existing resources, in conformity with the overall tendency of parasitic plants to have small seeds, poor in storage compounds [
 <xref rid="B38-plants-10-00438" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This allows the production of large amount of seeds by a single plant, a general strategy for longer persistence in parasitic plants [
 <xref rid="B39-plants-10-00438" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], but apparently is also a negative factor under stress conditions. Proteases (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00438-f005">Figure 5</xref>) were shown to be less involved in seed germination, especially in the parasitic species.
