<p>The ecological strategy of the parasitic species involves strong physical and possibly physiological dormancy [

 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> is directed toward immediate attachment to a potential host. Typically, the highest infectious potential of the seedlings is observed in the first 5–7 days, when the events of host attachment and further haustoria and secondary stem formation were fast to immediate. Under control conditions, the observed germination rate of 100% (
