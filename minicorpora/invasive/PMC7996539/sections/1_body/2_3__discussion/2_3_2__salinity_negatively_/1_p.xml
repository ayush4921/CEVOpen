<p>Apparently, the parasitic 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> were shown to be much more sensitive to salinity than their nonparasitic relatives. Not only were germination rate (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00438-f001">Figure 1</xref>) and growth in host absence (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00438-f002">Figure 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00438-f003">Figure 3</xref>) negatively affected, but also the further ability to infect potential hosts and growth rates after establishment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00438-f006">Figure 6</xref>). This was especially true for 
 <italic>C. campestris</italic>, a widely distributed invasive species, while the other two 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> species proved to be less sensitive to salinity in terms of germination (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00438-f001">Figure 1</xref>), but also less successful at the later developmental stages. Generally, 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> spp. are known to germinate under wide amplitudes of environmental conditions [
 <xref rid="B33-plants-10-00438" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-plants-10-00438" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Such plasticity is largely related to the possibility that if a suitable host plant is available, then the further growth of the parasite is ensured. Some authors reported insensibility of 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> seedlings to stress-responsive ABA signaling [
 <xref rid="B41-plants-10-00438" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], suggesting that under stress conditions the parasite still strives for host attachment in an “infect-or-perish” attempt, without being affected by common stress responsive mechanisms. Similarly, the early growth of 
 <italic>C. campestris</italic> and 
 <italic>C. chinensis</italic> under salinity was subordinated to retained growth in length rather than weight accumulation as seen from mass-to-length ratios (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00438-f002">Figure 2</xref>c) as compared to the nonparasitic species and successful host infection ensured further survival, although at reduced growth rate (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00438-f006">Figure 6</xref>). Similarly, when dormancy was broken for any reason under unfavorable conditions, the seeds seemed to mobilize any possible resources (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00438-f004">Figure 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00438-f005">Figure 5</xref>) to ensure the early survival.
