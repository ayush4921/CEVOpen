<p>It should be noted, however, that a single 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> spp. plant produces several thousands of seeds [
 <xref rid="B39-plants-10-00438" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], which are heterogenic, germinate unevenly and over several years [
 <xref rid="B33-plants-10-00438" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. A rough calculation from the current experiment would lead to the idea that under 200 mM NaCl approximately 15% of all 
 <italic>Cuscuta campestris</italic> seeds would give successfully developing plantsâ€”50% attached to host from 30% germinated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00438-f001">Figure 1</xref>), also with a significant delay in time. In a saline environment, however, the relatively lower biodiversity suggests fewer and more slowly growing hosts [
 <xref rid="B2-plants-10-00438" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], which in turns leads to the understanding that under such conditions the slower germination and growth rate along with fewer survived 
 <italic>C. campestris</italic> would be in conformity to the host availability and would reduce the intraspecific competition within the parasitic plant population. Even though it is probably not an evolutionary adaptation on purpose, the inhibiting effect of salinity on the parasitic plant may be beneficial in the above discussed situation.
