0: A special case here represents the interactions between parasitic plants and their respective hosts.
1: Although few of them are considered halophytes, they are also known to inhabit salinized lands and parasitized on halophytic hosts [ 21].
2: Some, like  Cuscuta salina Engelm.
3: significantly shape plant species biodiversity in salt marshes [ 22] and coastal wetlands [ 23] by preferentially infecting and thus restricting certain species and avoiding others.
4: Salinity might change host preferences of the parasite.
5: It is experienced by the parasite through metabolic and physiological changes in the host [ 24] and simultaneously the parasite may impair the proper response to salinity of its host [ 25].
