0: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of salinity on germination and parasitic development of  C. campestris in comparison to two other  Cuscuta species, the widely distributed Asian species  Cuscuta chinensis Lam.
1: and  Cuscuta japonica Choisy., as well as two nonparasitic members of Convolvulaceae family  Ipomoea tricolor Cav.,  Convolvulus arvensis L. and  Calystegia sepium (L.) R. Br.
2: The choice of  C. chinensis was driven by the phenotypical similarity with  C. campestris [ 28], while  C. japonica was chosen due to its contrasting phenotype to  C. campestris and its recent status of noxious weed in North America, suggesting its invasive potential [ 29].
3: Of the nonparasitic species,  I. tricolor is a popular ornamental plant, while  Convolvulus arvensis and  Calystegia sepium are widely distributed weed species [ 30].
4: Overall, numerous species within the family are fast-growing vines with weed potential.
