0: Salinity stress is among the most damaging environmental factors, affecting plant growth and development worldwide, also leading to increasing crop yield losses [ 1].
1: Although some plant species, called halophytes, are naturally adapted to saline conditions and could sustain extreme salt concentrations [ 2], the predominant flora, respectively most of the crop plants are glycophytes, e.g., salt-sensitive.
2: As such, the question of improvement of crop salt tolerance [ 1, 3] has been a major topic in contemporary scientific literature for decades.
