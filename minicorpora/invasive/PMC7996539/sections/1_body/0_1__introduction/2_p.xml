<p>Salts affect plantsâ€™ lifecycles at every possible stage, from breaking dormancy and early germination events through vegetation to flowering and seed yield [
 <xref rid="B4-plants-10-00438" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. First, soil salinity leads to decreased osmotic potential, preventing or impeding imbibition and seed germination. Sodium chloride concentration as low as 50 mM could lead to over 75% decrease of germination percentage of some species (
 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (L.) Heynh. ecotype Col, [
 <xref rid="B4-plants-10-00438" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]). Certain halophytes, although also challenged by extreme salinity, may retain germination ability above 10% at concentrations as high as 1 M or greater [
 <xref rid="B5-plants-10-00438" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Seed germination ability under salinity of a particular species may vary significantly, based on genotypic differences [
 <xref rid="B6-plants-10-00438" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], seed heteromorphism [
 <xref rid="B7-plants-10-00438" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and may be altered by seed priming with natural or synthetic compounds [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-10-00438" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The complex response of seeds to salt stress during germination is generally managed by gibberellic acid [
 <xref rid="B9-plants-10-00438" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], abscisic acid [
 <xref rid="B10-plants-10-00438" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] or ethylene and nitric oxide [
 <xref rid="B11-plants-10-00438" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] triggered pathways. Further plant development is negatively affected by salinity through the extensively studied mechanisms of osmotic stress and ion toxicity [
 <xref rid="B12-plants-10-00438" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], combated by ion exclusion/sequestration [
 <xref rid="B13-plants-10-00438" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], compatible solute accumulation [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-10-00438" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and antioxidant response [
