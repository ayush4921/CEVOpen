1: is among the most prominent.
2: It is a North American species, currently with worldwide distribution [ 26], highly invasive and challenging for crop production in numerous countries [ 27].
3: It is a stem holoparasitic plant with generalist preferencesinfecting numerous host plant species simultaneously.
4: Although not considered a typical halophyte specialist like its relative  C. salina, in 2018 it was found on the Bulgarian sea coast, parasitizing  Centaurea arenaria Bieb.
5: & Willd.
6: on a sand dune (NG 67, 421350 N 274635 E, herbarium SO 107977 of Sofia University).
7: Its high ecological plasticity raises concerns that it might spread beyond optimal conditions and damage fragile ecosystems like coastal lands and pose additional threat to the emerging agriculture in salinized areas.
8: Its parasitic potential under salt stress conditions, however, is not extensively studied.
