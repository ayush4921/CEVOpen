0: Abiotic stress factors also lead to substantial changes of plant communities, affecting biodiversity and organismal interactions.
1: Particularly salinity affects soil microbial biodiversity [ 16] and shapes plant communities by benefiting slow growing halophytes over glycophytes [ 17].
2: Next, the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis is also largely affected [ 18], as well as plant susceptibility to various diseases, which may either increase [ 19] or decrease [ 20].
