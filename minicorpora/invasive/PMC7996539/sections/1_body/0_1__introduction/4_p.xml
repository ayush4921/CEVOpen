<p>A special case here represents the interactions between parasitic plants and their respective hosts. Although few of them are considered halophytes, they are also known to inhabit salinized lands and parasitized on halophytic hosts [
 <xref rid="B21-plants-10-00438" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Some, like 
 <italic>Cuscuta salina</italic> Engelm. significantly shape plant species biodiversity in salt marshes [
 <xref rid="B22-plants-10-00438" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and coastal wetlands [
 <xref rid="B23-plants-10-00438" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] by preferentially infecting and thus restricting certain species and avoiding others. Salinity might change host preferences of the parasite. It is experienced by the parasite through metabolic and physiological changes in the host [
 <xref rid="B24-plants-10-00438" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and simultaneously the parasite may impair the proper response to salinity of its host [
