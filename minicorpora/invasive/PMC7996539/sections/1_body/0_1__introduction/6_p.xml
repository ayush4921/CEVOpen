<p>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of salinity on germination and parasitic development of 
 <italic>C. campestris</italic> in comparison to two other 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> species, the widely distributed Asian species 
 <italic>Cuscuta chinensis</italic> Lam. and 
 <italic>Cuscuta japonica</italic> Choisy., as well as two nonparasitic members of Convolvulaceae family 
 <italic>Ipomoea tricolor</italic> Cav., 
 <italic>Convolvulus arvensis</italic> L. and 
 <italic>Calystegia sepium</italic> (L.) R. Br. The choice of 
 <italic>C. chinensis</italic> was driven by the phenotypical similarity with 
 <italic>C. campestris</italic> [
 <xref rid="B28-plants-10-00438" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], while 
 <italic>C. japonica</italic> was chosen due to its contrasting phenotype to 
 <italic>C. campestris</italic> and its recent status of noxious weed in North America, suggesting its invasive potential [
 <xref rid="B29-plants-10-00438" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Of the nonparasitic species, 
 <italic>I. tricolor</italic> is a popular ornamental plant, while 
 <italic>Convolvulus arvensis</italic> and 
 <italic>
  <underline>Calystegia sepium</underline>
 </italic> are widely distributed weed species [
 <xref rid="B30-plants-10-00438" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Overall, numerous species within the family are fast-growing vines with weed potential.
