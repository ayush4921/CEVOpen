0: Salts affect plants lifecycles at every possible stage, from breaking dormancy and early germination events through vegetation to flowering and seed yield [ 4].
1: First, soil salinity leads to decreased osmotic potential, preventing or impeding imbibition and seed germination.
2: Sodium chloride concentration as low as 50 mM could lead to over 75% decrease of germination percentage of some species ( Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh.
3: ecotype Col, [ 4]).
4: Certain halophytes, although also challenged by extreme salinity, may retain germination ability above 10% at concentrations as high as 1 M or greater [ 5].
5: Seed germination ability under salinity of a particular species may vary significantly, based on genotypic differences [ 6], seed heteromorphism [ 7] and may be altered by seed priming with natural or synthetic compounds [ 8].
6: The complex response of seeds to salt stress during germination is generally managed by gibberellic acid [ 9], abscisic acid [ 10] or ethylene and nitric oxide [ 11] triggered pathways.
7: Further plant development is negatively affected by salinity through the extensively studied mechanisms of osmotic stress and ion toxicity [ 12], combated by ion exclusion/sequestration [ 13], compatible solute accumulation [ 14] and antioxidant response [ 15].
