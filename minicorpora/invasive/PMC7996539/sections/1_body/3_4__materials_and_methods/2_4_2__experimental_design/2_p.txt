0: Initial seedling growth was measured as length in cm and fresh mass in mg 7 days after germination of each individual seedling.
1: Further development was assessed as growth in length (cm) and fresh weight (mg) per day after transfer of the seedlings in soil:vermiculite mixture (3:1) in individual pots (nonparasitic species) or on pregrown  Arabidopsis thaliana plants to serve as hosts ( Cuscuta spp.)
2: 10 days after transfer (nonparasitic species) or after formation of a secondary stem ( Cuscuta spp.).
3: Plants were grown in greenhouse conditions at 22 C, 70% relative humidity and 16 h light/8 h dark photoperiod.
