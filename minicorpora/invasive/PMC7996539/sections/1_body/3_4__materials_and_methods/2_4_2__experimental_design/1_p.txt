0: Seeds from all species were surface sterilized for 3 min in 70% ethanol, 5 min in 10% commercial bleach, washed in distilled water 5 times, chemically scarified in concentrated sulfuric acid for 15 min to break dormancy and placed on 5 layers of filter paper, soaked with either 0 (control), 100 or 200 mM NaCl in distilled water in 110 mm diameter glass petri dishes.
1: Sodium chloride concentrations were chosen on the basis of preliminary experiments on  C. campestris alone from a concentration range from 0 to 400 mM NaCl where less than 100 mM NaCl had little or no effect and more than 200 mM NaCl inhibited further seedling growth, although not inhibiting germination completely.
2: Germination was performed in a phytostatic chamber at 27 C, 16 h light/8 h dark photoperiod.
3: Germination rate was recorded for 10 days.
4: Germination percentage was calculated as following: (1)Germination percentage= Number of germinated seedsTotal number of seeds  100
