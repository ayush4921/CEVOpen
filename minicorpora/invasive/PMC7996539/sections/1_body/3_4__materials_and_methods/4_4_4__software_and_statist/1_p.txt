0: Germination was performed in triplicates, each one consisting of 100 seeds (20 seeds per petri dish for  Cuscuta spp.
1: and 5 seeds per petri dish for the nonparasitic species).
2: All other measurements were performed on 6 individual seedlings, originating from at least 3 individual petri dishes.
3: Results for parameters of growth are presented as percentage of control to allow comparison between the parasitic and nonparasitic species due to the much bigger seeds and seedlings of nonparasitic species.
4: All data were statistically analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with level of significance at either  p  0.05 or  p  0.01 with Tukeys post hoc test and Levenes test for homogeneity on JASP 0.9.0.1 (University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands).
5: For germination percentage the effect of salinity on germination within individual species was tested at the 5th and 10th day.
6: Factorial ANOVA was performed to test the effect of species, salinity and interaction between them on the final germination.
7: Final germination percentage (10th day) of the controls of each species was assumed as 100% and germination percentage under salinity was recalculated: (2)Germination percentage = Number of germinated seeds Number of germinatedseeds at 0 mM NaCl  100
