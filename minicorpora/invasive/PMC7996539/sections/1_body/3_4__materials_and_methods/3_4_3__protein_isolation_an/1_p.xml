<p>Water-soluble proteins were isolated after the grinding of plant material in liquid nitrogen, and resuspension in 0.1 mL per 0.01 g tissue of phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.2) in absence of protease inhibitors and centrifugation at 10 000 g, 4 °C for 15 min. The protein concentration in the supernatant was measured by Pierce
 <sup>TM</sup> BCA Protein Assay Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and for further experiments all samples were separated by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS PAGE) at 15 µg quantity. Semidenaturing SDS PAGE was performed essentially according to the Laemmli protocol [

 <xref rid="B43-plants-10-00438" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. For protease activity the in-gel substrate was 0.1% gelatin and staining was with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 in 40% methanol, 10% acetic acid. For α-amylase activity in-gel substrate was 0.2% soluble starch and staining was with iodine solution (10 mM I
 <sub>2</sub> and 14 mM KI).
