 <caption> Seedlings growth at 0, 100 mM and 200 mM NaCl. Growth was calculated as cm day-1 ( a), mg day-1 ( b) and mass-to-length (mg cm −1) ratio ( c) and presented as percent of control. Different letters indicate statistical significance at p ≤ 0.05 (Tukey’s post hoc test), one-way ANOVA analysis (* p ≤ 0.05; ** p ≤ 0.01). n = 6. Levene’s homogeneity test: p &gt; 0.05. Presented values are mean ± SEM. </caption>
