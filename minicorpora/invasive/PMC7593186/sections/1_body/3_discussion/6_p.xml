<p>The results of this study clearly indicate the extent to which invading plant species can cause both direct and indirect effects on multiple taxa as well as different trophic and functional groups. In this particular example, the invading species benefited invertebrate communities, albeit with as yet unknown subsequent impacts on higher trophic levels. Such positive effects are certainly species‐specific and not congruent with all species invasions nor are effects consistent across affected taxa (Fletcher et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36752-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Whether these positive effects are transient or are dependent upon current white‐tailed deer densities or the history of deer browsing requires further study. As such, management actions to control this invasive species must be conducted with consideration of deer browse and other pressures that affect understory vegetation growth, including forest succession.

The importance of fully understanding the suite of effects from invasive plants, both direct and indirect and positive and negative, is apparent when considering the breadth and extent of potentially invasive plant species introductions. As the world's flora becomes increasingly homogenized from plant species introductions (Mack et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36752-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>; Qian &amp; Ricklefs, 
 <xref rid="ece36752-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>), land managers and conservation biologists must consider any subsequent, cascading impacts in order to prioritize invasive plant management efforts.
