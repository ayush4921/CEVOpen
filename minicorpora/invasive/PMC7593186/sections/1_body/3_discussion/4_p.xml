<p>Our findings may be restricted to those areas with high ungulate densities and resulting depauperate understory vegetation: Deer densities in our sampling area were between 46 and 66 deer/km
 <sup>2</sup> while densities at much lower levels can cause significant impacts to understory forest vegetation and structure (Horsley, Stout, &amp; de Calesta, 
 <xref rid="ece36752-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>; Tilghman, 
 <xref rid="ece36752-bib-0063" ref-type="ref">1989</xref>). Vertical vegetative structure was consistently minimal in both invaded and reference plots except at Antietam, where a single reference plot contained greater vertical plant structure. This plot pair exhibited the opposite trend as compared to other plot pairs. Reference plots here contained more wasps, flies, true bugs, and, subsequently, spiders. In areas that experience a loss of plant structure from dense ungulate populations, as we found in nearly all plot pairs, 
 <italic>M. vimineum</italic> may provide the only remaining shelter for insects and the only available plant structure for web‐building spiders. While we noted this in the present study with 
 <italic>M. vimineum</italic>, similar trends may also arise with other invasive or native plants in areas with limited understory vegetation, given the additional structural complexity brought about by the plant. Vegetation structure is a critical factor affecting the ability of a habitat to support understory spiders in forests with extensive ungulate herbivory (Landsman &amp; Bowman,

 <xref rid="ece36752-bib-0062" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). In habitats where additional native or non‐native structure exists, the relationship between 
 <italic>M. vimineum</italic> and the invertebrate community could reverse, as was noticeable in the Antietam plot pair and evident in the significance of the interaction term between Park and plant invasion on many of the response variables. This relationship has also been noted with forest birds in similar habitats (Tymkiw et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36752-bib-0066" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>).
