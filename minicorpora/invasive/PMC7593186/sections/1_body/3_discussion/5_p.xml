<p>Indirectly, patches of 
 <italic>M. vimineum</italic> sustain a more diverse, species‐rich, and dense spider assemblage through the subsidization of additional prey in forested habitats with substantial large vertebrate browse. Alteration of the physical environment from plant species invasion, including an enhanced structural complexity of the litter and near‐forest floor habitat, often benefits detrital consumers which in turn support forest predators (McCary et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36752-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Forest understory spiders have been shown to benefit from augmented detrital communities (Miyashita et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36752-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>), though the long‐term physiological implications from such dietary shifts are unknown. Predatory spiders are known to shift diet composition in habitats that have experienced plant species invasion and resultant changes in insect prey availability (deHart &amp; Strand, 
 <xref rid="ece36752-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Gratton &amp; Denno, 
 <xref rid="ece36752-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). Flies within the invaded habitats in our study area likely contributed a greater relative proportion of the diet of understory spiders as their density within 
 <italic>M. vimineum</italic> plots was nearly six times that within reference plots. Spiders also exhibited enriched δ
 <sup>15</sup>N within invaded plots and with greater abundance of Diptera, additionally indicating that detritus‐based flies, which also exhibit enriched isotopic nitrogen, constitute an increased proportion of spider diet in invaded habitats (Hyodo, 
 <xref rid="ece36752-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). As guanotelic organisms such as spiders use nitrogen efficiently, diet shifts that include a greater relative percentage of nitrogen‐poor prey may affect individual body condition and fecundity (Toft &amp; Wise, 
 <xref rid="ece36752-bib-0064" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>) and could cause subsequent impacts to the nutrient flow to higher predators. Spiders constitute a significant, proteinaceous component of the diet of araneophagic predators such as nesting birds. Invaded habitats may contain a greater abundance of spiders and thus more available food for forest birds; however, changes to the available spider species and nutritional quality of individual spiders may affect fecundity and development of young for birds (Ladin, D'Amico, Jaisi, &amp; Shriver, 
 <xref rid="ece36752-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Narango, Tallamy, &amp; Marra, 
 <xref rid="ece36752-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>; Ramsay &amp; Houston, 
 <xref rid="ece36752-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>). The patchy distribution and growth habit of 
 <italic>M. vimineum</italic> populations create disparate and highly localized areas of prey subsidization for spiders, ultimately resulting in diverse and abundant predator communities. Such localized predator densities could affect forest nutritional dynamics and create hotspots of elevated nutrient levels (Hodkinson, Coulson, Harrison, &amp; Webb, 
 <xref rid="ece36752-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>; Kitchell et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36752-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">1979</xref>; Schmitz, Hawlena, &amp; Trussell, 
 <xref rid="ece36752-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). Changes to the arthropod food web, brought about through replacement of native plants by invasive species, are largely undocumented and potentially pervasive across forest habitats with introduced and invasive plants.
