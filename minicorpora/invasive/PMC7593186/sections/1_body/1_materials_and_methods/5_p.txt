0: For a closer examination of changes in nutritional dynamics, we also specifically sampled a representative orbweaving spider common to eastern deciduous forests (Tetragnathidae:  Leucauge venusta Walckenaer 1841) prior to vacuum sampling for the remaining invertebrate community.
1: We sampled  L. venusta as this species was commonly found throughout the study area and has a wide geographic distribution across much of eastern North America.
2: This species spins a relatively horizontal orb web with attachment points in lowgrowing vegetation in wooded areas.
3: L. venusta and other relatively small orbweaving spiders prey mostly on flies (Diptera), leafhoppers (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae), and other small, alate true bugs, and beetles (Coleoptera).
4: We collected mature female spiders by hand from plots in early July 2017.
5: Samples were immediately frozen and individually dried for 24 hr at 60C.
6: We then weighed the dry spider samples to obtain body mass.
7: Spiders were then individually ground, homogenized, and encapsulated.
8: We analyzed individual spiders for  15N and  13C using a continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer (DELTA V Plus; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and elemental analyzer (NC 2,500, Carlo Erba; 95% CI 0.5).
9: Isotopic nitrogen ratios can provide information on a predator's diet, while isotopic carbon can reveal photosynthetic pathways in sampled organisms:  M. vimineum, a C 4 species, maintains  13C levels between 13 and 15, while C 3 plants generally have  13C values near 27 (Bradford et al.,  2010; Hyodo,  2015).
10: Analyses were conducted at the Central Appalachians Stable Isotope Facility at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science's Appalachian Laboratory.
11: Isotopic carbon results were expressed in parts per mille relative to Vienna PeeDee Belemnite, with isotopic nitrogen reported in parts per mille relative to atmospheric nitrogen.
