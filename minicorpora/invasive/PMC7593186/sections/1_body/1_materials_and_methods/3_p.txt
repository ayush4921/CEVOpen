0: To study invertebrate community response to  M. vimineum, we used a paired plot design across our study area.
1: Within each of the three parks, we opportunistically located 16 patches of  M. vimineum at least 10 m by 10 m in size, and at least 10 m away from the forest edge.
2: Sites were selected that contained greater than or equal to 80% visual ground cover of  M. vimineum.
3: We established the center of a 6 m by 6 m square plot at the approximate center of the patch.
4: Paired with each  M. vimineum plot, we also established a reference plot of the same size, without  M. vimineum.
5: We used random integers to select an azimuth from which to establish reference plots, 20 m from the edge of the  M. vimineum patch, at least 10 m from the forest edge, and within the same vegetation community type.
6: Within individual square plots for both invaded and reference habitats, we estimated ground cover of  M. vimineum in four 1 m 2 square subplots, 1 m away from the plot center in the four cardinal directions, and used the mean ground cover estimate for each plot.
7: We also measured understory vegetative structure using a 2.0 m tall profile board placed in the center of the plot.
8: We estimated the percentage of the board that was obscured by vegetation between 0.5 and 2.0 m in height and used the mean of the four values for each plot in analyses.
