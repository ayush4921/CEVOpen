0: Here, our objective was to better understand the direct and indirect impacts that the invasive  M. vimineum has on the invertebrate prey and predator communities and to demonstrate whether such invasions have the potential to affect predatorprey interactions in the forest understory.
1: As  M. vimineum invades, it can alter nearground vertical plant structure and the availability of palatable food resources, both of which may directly and indirectly alter the composition of the invertebrate community.
2: We hypothesized that the abundance of herbivorous insects would decrease in  M. vimineum patches due to suppression of native vegetation and food resources, and that, conversely, dipteran species in detrital food webs would prefer the sheltered microhabitat created by dense  M. vimineum stands.
3: We similarly predicted changes to the spider community in invaded habitats: While spider richness and diversity would not change within  M. vimineum, we expected to see changes in community composition as alterations to nearground plant structure negatively impact webbuilding taxa and benefit active hunting spiders.
4: Finally, we hypothesized that web spider isotopic nitrogen signatures would reflect the greater proportion of available detritivorous insects in spider diet and that spider isotopic carbon would reflect the greater relative contribution of C 4M.
5: vimineum biomass in invaded areas.
