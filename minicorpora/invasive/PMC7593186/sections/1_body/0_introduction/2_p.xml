<p>Direct effects of one species on another can be relatively easy to quantify, particularly when considering simplified, two species interactions. However, such straightforward exchanges are rarely found in nature, with secondary and tertiary effects pervading into subsequent trophic levels and affecting multiple species (Preisser, Bolnick, &amp; Benard, 
 <xref rid="ece36752-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>; Werner &amp; Peacor, 
 <xref rid="ece36752-bib-0071" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>). Indirect interactions of one species on another through a third species can affect species' density and can impose behavioral changes to the indirectly affected species (Abrams,

 <xref rid="ece36752-bib-0071" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>). Given the prevalence and strength of indirect species interactions, these relationships can often exert more influence over ecological communities that can direct interactions between a predator and herbivore (Seibold, Cadotte, MacIvor, Thorn, &amp; Müller, 
 <xref rid="ece36752-bib-0059" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>) and have been documented in various aquatic and terrestrial habitats (Fletcher et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36752-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>; Vilá et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36752-bib-0069" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). Despite their ecological significance, indirect effects among species can be complex and difficult to detect, and as a result are often understudied and overlooked.
