0: Microstegium vimineum is a grass species from eastern Asia that invades forest edges and disturbed habitats in the eastern half of the U.S. (Flory, Long, & Clay,  2011; Huebner,  2010).
1: The species forms dense mats across the forest floor by spreading from stolons, ultimately reducing native tree seedling density, growth, and diversity (Oswalt, Oswalt, & Clatterbuck,  2007; Brewer,  2011), as well as overall native plant species cover (Adams & Engelhardt,  2009).
2: The forest floor in invaded habitats in Maryland, often in areas with high densities of vertebrate herbivores, is generally simplified in structure, due in part to the growth habit of  M. vimineum (Civitello, Flory, & Clay,  2008; Landsman pers.
3: obs.).
4: Given its growth habit and stand density, the presence of  M. vimineum also alters abiotic characteristics of the nearground forest environment.
5: The forest floor experiences an increase in solar irradiation within  M. vimineum stands, which decreases relative humidity and increases microhabitat temperatures (Civitello et al.,  2008).
6: Such climatic changes subsequently alter the ability of  M. vimineum patches to host invertebrate populations:  M. vimineum ground cover has been shown to reduce the overall diversity of soil microarthropods by greatly increasing the abundance of mites and subsequently reducing community evenness (McGrath & Binkley,  2009).
7: The abundance of cicadellidae planthoppers, as well as acridid and gryllid Orthoptera, was also found to be higher in  M. vimineum patches (Marshall & Buckley,  2009).
8: Conversely,  M. vimineum can also reduce the abundance of Blattodea and chrysomelid beetles, as well as the abundance and survival of hard tick species in the Ixodidae (Civitello et al.,  2008; Marshall & Buckley,  2009).
