0: Direct effects of one species on another can be relatively easy to quantify, particularly when considering simplified, two species interactions.
1: However, such straightforward exchanges are rarely found in nature, with secondary and tertiary effects pervading into subsequent trophic levels and affecting multiple species (Preisser, Bolnick, & Benard,  2005; Werner & Peacor,  2003).
2: Indirect interactions of one species on another through a third species can affect species' density and can impose behavioral changes to the indirectly affected species (Abrams,  1995; Werner & Peacor,  2003).
3: Given the prevalence and strength of indirect species interactions, these relationships can often exert more influence over ecological communities that can direct interactions between a predator and herbivore (Seibold, Cadotte, MacIvor, Thorn, & Muller,  2018) and have been documented in various aquatic and terrestrial habitats (Fletcher et al.,  2019; Vila et al.,  2011).
4: Despite their ecological significance, indirect effects among species can be complex and difficult to detect, and as a result are often understudied and overlooked.
