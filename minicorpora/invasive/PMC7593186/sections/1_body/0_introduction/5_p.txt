0: Microstegium vimineum directly affects forest floor invertebrates by physically altering their habitat; however, knowledge of subsequent indirect effects to the predators that utilize those affected invertebrates resulting from invasiondriven forest floor changes is lacking.
1: Physiognomic changes in structural complexity resulting from invasive plant species with similar, matforming growth habits have been shown to alter community structure, composition, and species abundance of the spider community (Bultman & DeWitt,  2008; Wolkovich, Bolger, & Holway,  2009).
2: Given the importance of forest spiders as an intermediate link between vertebrate and invertebrate food webs, the indirect impacts of invading  M. vimineum on forestdwelling spider communities have the potential to augment or depress prey densities, affect vertebrate predator populations, and alter the nutritional dynamics of invertebrate and vertebrate food webs (Gunnarsson,  1996,  2007; Miyashita & Takada,  2007; Philpott, Greenberg, Bichier, & Perfecto,  2004; Spiller & Schoener,  1988; Walters, Mills, Fritz, & Raikow,  2010).
