 <caption> Differences in isotopic carbon and nitrogen ratios of sampled Leucauge venusta spiders between reference and invaded plots in the three sampled parks. Isotopic carbon results are expressed in parts per mille relative to Vienna PeeDee Belemnite, with isotopic nitrogen reported in parts per mille relative to atmospheric nitrogen. Microstegium vimineum typically contains δ 13C levels between −13 and −15‰ while C 3 plants are generally between −26 and −27‰ </caption>
