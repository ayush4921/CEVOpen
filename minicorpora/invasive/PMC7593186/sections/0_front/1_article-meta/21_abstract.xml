 <p>The indirect effects of invasive plant species are complex, difficult to detect, and in some cases may provide ecological benefits in certain habitats. We identified positive effects of an invasive grass species on the abundance, richness, and diversity of a forest spider community, mediated through available insect prey. Such ecological benefits are certainly habitat‐ and species‐specific, which highlights the importance of understanding indirect effects when managing invasive species.
