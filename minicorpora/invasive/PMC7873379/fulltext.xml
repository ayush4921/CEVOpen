It causes evident damage on the epigeal parts of plant (leaves and branches) and, in particular, on the fruits, causing their fall and/or deterioration, making them unsuitable for sale. EPPO has signaled its presence in many Asian countries and in the Middle East, in South and Central America and in some regions of the African continent, but not yet in Europe. There are several possible ways of introducing this pathogen into the Mediterranean Basin and, among these, there is the trade of plant material for propagation and planting and the flow of tourism between the risk areas and the Mediterranean countries. This research demonstrates how the risk of invasion through ornamental Rutaceae is evident and identifies - in a participatory way through the involvement of stakeholders - some possible tools of phytosanitary protection. The methodological approach, with multi-criteria analysis, recognizes the interest in forms of protection represented by voluntary certification tools, rather than the introduction of new taxation that can finance the protection system.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="teaser" id="abs0015"><p>Pest risk analysis; stakeholders analysis; import/export of ornamental Rutaceae; social, economic and environmental criteria; voluntary phytosanitary certification.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Pest risk analysis</kwd><kwd>Stakeholders analysis</kwd><kwd>Import / Export of ornamental Rutaceae</kwd><kwd>Social</kwd><kwd>Economic and environmental criteria</kwd><kwd>Voluntary phytosanitary certification</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">The spread of invasive species, as a consequence of the globalization and internationalization of markets, is a problem not only from a biological, ecological, environmental, and landscape point of view but also from an economic and social sides, widely analyzed in the literature [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The &#x0201c;pest risk analysis&#x0201d; (PRA), which consists of &#x0201c;pest hazard identification&#x0201d; (PHI), &#x0201c;pest risk assessment&#x0201d; (PRA), &#x0201c;pest risk management&#x0201d; (PRM) and &#x0201c;pest risk communication&#x0201d; (PRC) has an interdisciplinary nature [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] because it must provide the scientific justification of the phytosanitary measures adopted by a country for its defense, in order to be able to demonstrate and compare the real necessity of the measures at world level [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Risk assessment and risk management interact, but they are also functionally separate risk analysis activities [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p id="p0015">In the various areas of the PRA, according to a predominantly economic perspective [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], various contributions have been produced, not only on the assessment of the consequences deriving from the invasion of alien species in the form of direct damage produced or costs control, but also in understanding the problem from a holistic point of view; the provision of barriers and control policy tools (tariffs, import restrictions, etc.); the evaluation of the benefits and costs of control alternatives, also to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of publicly funded programs [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]; the preparation of bioeconomic models that take into account the dynamics of interaction within and between ecological and economic systems [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p id="p0020">Since every invasion of alien species involves direct and indirect costs and, therefore, private and social costs [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], the economic impact assessments - necessary as scientific support provided by the International Plant Protection Convention and the World Trade Organization Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary measures - are usually carried out with a qualitative or quantitative approach. The choice is often made to depend on the availability of data and the ability to prepare specific forecasting models, or able to justify the adoption of certain measures [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], or to support adequate decision-making strategies using the knowledge of the experts for the calibration of models and the evaluation of the potential distribution of an invasion [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, the procedures used to assess impacts often influence the results of the assessment [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]; the &#x0201c;Cost-benefit analysis&#x0201d; is used for the purpose, among others, to evaluate the current and future costs and benefits in monetary units associated with a series of alternatives, projects or political instruments to combat environmental damage and the compromise of ecosystem services; the &#x0201c;Cost-Effectiveness Analysis&#x0201d;, for the comparison of different options or management options for the evaluation of the benefits of the control actions of invasive species; the &#x0201c;Multi-Criteria Analysis&#x0201d;, an approach that allows to incorporate multiple dimensions of the effects and to include both qualitative and quantitative information associated with the impacts of invasive species and those relating to the implementation of management responses, so as to overcome the uncertainties related invasion and decision making; the &#x0201c;Development Scenario&#x0201d;, in which the scenarios are plausible alternative descriptions, supported by quantitative indicators [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p id="p0025">Since the introduction paths of invasive species involve different goods, consumer goods, packaging, and multiple modes of transport, an international political framework was built, consisting of a series of commercial, environmental, and transportation agreements, subject to coordination and harmonization. Consequently, several international institutions interested in plant defense have arisen, such as the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA); the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO); the EU Directorate-General for Health and Food Safety (SANTE), the main body of the European Commission operating within the framework of the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) of the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) and the agreements signed in the framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO); the US Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). Institutional responses based on the models currently in use could include preventive measures to counter a possible invasion, management of the existing parasitic problem, or eradication. These actions consist in the regulation of production and trade to the point of involving the obligatory destruction of productive capital (for example, the abatement of production); loss of access to the export market; loss of recreational benefits for domestic consumers; losses for producers directly affected by the pathogen; even if in the long run it is possible to record the improvement of technology and company productivity and, in some cases, of product quality after reversing the effects of the pathogen [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p id="p0030">In this context, it is necessary to consider Citrus Bacterial Canker (CBC), a potentially dangerous phytopathy for the Mediterranean Basin, caused by two similar but taxonomically distinct bacteria: <italic>Xanthomonas citri</italic> pv. <italic>citri</italic> (synonym <italic>X.&#x000a0;citri</italic> subsp. <italic>citri</italic>) and <italic>X.&#x000a0;citri</italic> pv. <italic>aurantifolii</italic> (synonym <italic>X.&#x000a0;fuscans</italic> subsp. <italic>aurantifolii</italic>). As specified in other studies, &#x0201c;<italic>X.&#x000a0;citri</italic>&#x0201d; is used to refer to any citrus fruit canker (hyperplasia) produced by <italic>Xanthomonas</italic>, whether Asian (<italic>X.&#x000a0;citri</italic> pv. <italic>citri</italic>) or South American (<italic>X.&#x000a0;citri</italic> pv. <italic>aurantifolii</italic>) groups [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p id="p0035">Xc penetrates the plant tissue through stomas or wounds caused by cultivation techniques or natural agents such as wind or heavy rain. Within seven days of inoculation (although the incubation time is affected by temperature, increasing if below 20 &#x000b0;C), symptoms appear on the plant [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p id="p0040">The CBC causes significant damage to the epigean organs of the plant (leaves and branches) and, in particular, on the fruits causing their fall and/or decay, making them not suitable for commercialization [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The disease has never been reported in Europe and the Mediterranean Basin and, therefore, the two responsible bacteria are included in the list of quarantine pathogens of the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO) [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, the Panel on Plant Health (PLH) of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), in the document &#x0201c;Scientific Opinion on the risk to plant health of <italic>Xcc</italic> pv. <italic>citri</italic> and <italic>Xcc</italic> pv. <italic>aurantifolii</italic> for the EU territory&#x0201d; [<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], identified among the possible ways of entry of the bacterium into the Mediterranean Basin the trade flows of ornamental Rutaceae species, considering that some of these are widely cultivated in the Mediterranean countries and which activate a great economic and social function. The protective measures against the introduction of Xcc are governed by Directive 2000/29/EC and in the most recent EU Reg. 2031/2016, in which random CBC agents are inserted. In particular, the legislation acts to prevent many species of the genus &#x0201c;Citrus&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Fortunella&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Poncirus&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Murraya k&#x000f6;nig&#x0201d; (actually since subject to <italic>Diasphorina citri Kuway</italic>) and related hybrids (subject to contamination), except for fruits and seeds.</p><p id="p0045">The EU Implementing Regulation 2019/2072 provides a list of Rutaceae whose plants, subject to trade, can enter the EU territory with an "official declaration" of the Third Country or with the inclusion of a "supplementary declaration" on the phytosanitary certificate, certifying that the area of origin is free from Xc. Among the plants concerned are "Limonia L.", "Microcitrus Swingle", "Murraya J. Koenig", "Severina", "Poncirus Raf. and their hybrids", etc., although they are hardly traded from risk areas [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The risk, however, is connected to the import of plant material destined for planting, as <italic>Xcc</italic> would find favorable environmental conditions for its development, but not from the import of fruit due to the low probability of transferring the bacterium to a suitable host with this medium. Recent studies have shown that the risk of potential invasion is significant in light of the intense commercial exchanges of plant material between some areas at risk because the pathogen is present in them, and the Mediterranean Basin [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]; the consequent potential damage is, therefore, significant [<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p id="p0050">Since the presence of <italic>Xcc</italic> in the EU territory is not yet ascertained, it is, therefore, possible to definitively affirm that citrus cultivation enjoys a high degree of protection, by the institutional systems in charge in the various countries. These protection systems (phytosanitary authorities) act on the network intervening in the absence of phytosanitary documentation (passport for import/export activities) but do not prevent international trade since, in line with the WTO agreements, phytosanitary controls cannot become a real "non-tariff" barrier to free trade.</p><p id="p0055">Rutaceous species used for ornamental purposes, for which the market is booming, are not covered. This leads to the conclusion that if a more restrictive system of protection against Citrus Bacterial Cancer was to be applied, it would have been necessary to include in the annexes of Directive 2000/29 EU and EU Reg. 2031/2016 the entire taxonomic category "Rutaceae family" and not the individual citrus species, because this choice meant more freedom for ornamental species.</p><p id="p0060">Furthermore, since the literature shows that the invasion dynamics can be of the &#x0201c;intentional&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;unintentional&#x0201d; type, an adequate &#x0201c;pest risk assessment&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;pest risk management&#x0201d; in the case of the CBC must allow the identification of possible tools to prevent the risk of invasion within acceptable limits.</p><p id="p0065">In this context, we asked the following research questions:<list list-type="simple" id="ulist0010"><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0070">How relevant is the Xcc problem for the Mediterranean Basin?</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0075">Are the tools currently available adequate to protect EU borders?</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0080">What protection tools can be adopted in addition to the existing ones?</p></list-item></list></p><p id="p0085">This work has been developed to define, through the involvement of different categories of stakeholders and the use of multi-criteria analysis that allows considering complex problems, the aspects of the economic dimension of the problem of invasive species, the possible impacts of the CBC and defense strategies, to guide the activity of policymakers, public and private, in the choice of the most appropriate protection instruments. A possible invasion of CBC - through ornamental Rutaceae - generates in fact a diversified impact from an economic, social and environmental point of view, and since the means of combating it involve costs and benefits, they need a degree of acceptability in the different categories of stakeholders involved.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>The role of multicriteria analysis and application fields in the &#x0201c;pest risk analysis&#x0201d;</title><p id="p0090">Alien species can have several relevant ecological and socio-economic impacts and, therefore, effective and conflict-free management actions are needed, especially when the stakeholders who benefit from exotic species are different from those who bear the costs. Such conflicts of interest mean that management strategies are often not implemented unless all stakeholders of alien species or their management are involved [<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In the invasion processes the potential role of commercial networks, air transport connections, geographical proximity, climate similarity, the biological wealth of the countries of origin and the tourist flow are highlighted [<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].

For these purposes, the use of multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA), as a set of formal approaches, which seek to explicitly take into account multiple criteria in helping individuals or groups to explore the decisions that matter [<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] is widespread [<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p id="p0100">The different methods (MAUT, AHP, ANP, PROMETHEE, ELECTRE, MAVT, NAIADE, TOPSIS, and DRSA, to name a few) are flexible, with various uncertainty management thresholds, a more or less demanding cognitive level for decision-makers, and they have more or less simplified software support in use [<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p id="p0105">In particular, models that implicitly use quantitative and qualitative information as a primary input for MCDA, to assist decision-making in the field of biosafety, have spread over the past two decades [<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. They are applied in the "pre-incursion quarantine" phase or in the "post-incursion control measures" phase. In the first case, the pre-raid quarantine is designed to reduce or eliminate the probability of a raid. It entails an increase in implementation and management costs, but also negative effects on the well-being of consumers caused by limited commercial flows, as shown by some partial equilibrium analyzes [<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In the second case, if the disease or a parasite/pathogen escapes the established quarantine measures (if any) and its entry is confirmed, there are three basic strategies for dealing with it, namely eradication, doing nothing, or a combination of these first options. The criteria used often provide for a reduction in the quantity of yield and an increase in the cost of production [<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], also deriving from different decision-making protocols [<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p id="p0110">MCDA is so flexible that it is also used in cases where there are no specific risk maps (such as climatic suitability, host abundance or introduction potential) of invasive species [<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], o defined invasive pathways, or an indication of sites more sensitive and susceptible to invasion [<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].

The different intrinsic value of the marketed plant material determines a certain variability in the import and export values. The intensification of trade inevitably triggers an increase in the demand for phytosanitary services and a tightening of the system of rules (sanitary, phytosanitary, and technical regulations) that governs commercial activities, with the risk of triggering international marketing bans and consequent compromises of benefits for consumers and profits for nurseries.<fig id="fig4"><label>Figure&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Structure of imports and exports of plant material by main EU and Mediterranean basin countries (2019) (&#x02217;).

The ornamental Rutaceae are, in fact, an asset with elastic demand and a tax charge (both on the supply side and on the demand side) is seen as a reduction in price/quantity equilibrium, with the consequence that consumers pay more money and businesses receive less. In fact, various empirical evidence shows that both in case of sales tax and in tax on buyers there is damage for both, giving the parties identical regardless of who formally repays the tax. Not only that, but any product revenue is likely to be particularly low for the replacement of Rutaceae with other ornamental species, with fewer phytosanitary problems thus undermining the added value produced, the intense research activity upstream and the highly specialized factors (capital and work), who cannot find easily other jobs, especially in the short term. A basic concern emerges, therefore, that the taxation impairs the development of the market of ornamental Rutaceae.</p><p id="p0510">For these operators, the &#x0201c;status quo&#x0201d; scenario is largely preferred, followed in order of importance by &#x0201c;voluntary certification&#x0201d;. In reality, the &#x0201c;status quo&#x0201d; scenario demonstrates the effectiveness of the current system of phytosanitary protection, not currently a presence of <italic>Xcc</italic> in the Mediterranean Basin, but this is not sufficient against a possible threat due to &#x0201c;moral hazard&#x0201d; behavior by non-professional subjects and/or &#x0201c;superficial&#x0201d; attitudes by passengers and tourists attracted by the &#x0201c;novelty&#x0201d; and by the desire to bring home an ornamental vegetable typical of Asian and Middle-Eastern areas. Therefore, the alternative to the expansion of the trade of plants and/or parts of plants and of the inflow of tourists remains in the perspective of offering ornamental productions with greater guarantee. On this last scenario appears a substantial convergence of opinions by professional operators, with some exceptions among amateurs.</p><p id="p0515">The voluntary certification can be achieved by means of a voluntary protocol (codified process system verified and controlled by an independent third party) - which actually acts on the bureaucratic load of the production process, raising production costs - and/or creating a quarantine facility within the professional nurseries, so as to offer a commercial product (both for the domestic market and for the foreign market), which reassure on the many &#x0201c;qualities&#x0201d; of the company/process/product, including its traceability. A similar measure becomes effective even in the case where the producing company adopts decentralized production models, with relocations to other areas of the planet where the official requirements become weaker (i.e. areas where <italic>Xcc</italic> is present). Among other things, the voluntary supply of greater traceability should - as already mentioned - in line with the provisions of the new regulatory framework on phytosanitary surveillance (Regulation 2031/2016), starting from December 14 2019, which among other things provides for the possibility that professional operators will adopt a &#x0201c;Risk Management Plan related to harmful organisms&#x0201d;, plans that must be approved by the competent authority. The new legislation, however, appears to be strict with regard to the requirements for professional operators (not for example, on the total traceability - extended up to the cultivation substrates - and on the obligation to intervene), but with a view to supporting the free market exceptions to products (parts of plants not intended for sale) and non-professional operators, dangerous for a possible invasion of <italic>Xcc</italic>. These are &#x0201c;privileges&#x0201d; that amateurs do not intend to give up, as shown by the results of the model (these prefer to maintain the status quo).</p><p id="p0520">The sensitivity analysis shows the preference of the &#x0201c;status quo&#x0201d; by the production/consumption system, but also the transformation of opinions towards the affirmation of the &#x0201c;voluntary certification&#x0201d; due to the importance attributed to the environmental and economic criterion over the social one (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>).<fig id="fig6"><label>Figure&#x000a0;6</label><caption><p>Summary matrix of the judgements expressed in the evaluation of Xc's protective measures (2019) (&#x02217;).

This choice is supported by a prior motivation towards a long-awaited and long-lasting recreational value and by an expectation of environmental protection and the landscape, which influenced the more or less recent information relaunched by the mass media on recent phytosanitary problems and damage produced in some territorial contexts (<italic>Xylella fastidiosa</italic>, <italic>Citrus Tristeza Virus</italic> or <italic>CTV</italic>, Red palm weevil from <italic>Rhynchophorus ferrugineus</italic>, etc.).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0530">The identification of phytosanitary protection tools does not always represent an easy issue. It is necessary to find a balance system that does not compromise, on the one hand, the freedom of trade and all the advantages associated with it for the production and consumption system and, on the other, that safeguards the territories in their biological, environmental and naturalistic component and biodiversity protection [<xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>].</p><p id="p0535">The management of the protection of the Mediterranean Basin from <italic>Xc</italic>, where it can be conveyed by the areas in which the international bodies in charge (EPPO) have demonstrated its presence, through the commercial flow of ornamental Rutaceae and the flow of tourism, cannot be subtracted from these problems.</p><p id="p0540">The recent regulatory revision and the advent of EU Reg. 2031/2016, has not only introduced improvements and different prescriptive effectiveness compared to the sector legislation in force in the past (European Directive 2002/89/EC), as well as higher levels of responsibility to professional operators but has retained some discretionary choices for member countries on the amateur nursery and the freedom of action of tourists.</p><p id="p0545">Although not concerned with the latter, the introduction of potentially infected material by passengers depends not only from the intensity and clarity of the communication but also from the intensity of customs controls. The relative evaluation is difficult for the deficiencies in the phytosanitary surveillance staff with specific experience, for the deficiency in professional training and for cultural deficiency, since travelers are not fully aware of the socio-economic and environmental problem caused by a &#x0201c;superficial&#x0201d; import.</p><p id="p0550">For this reason, some protection tools can be suggested in increasing information, in order to determine a cultural change, with the introduction of the obligation to declare &#x0201c;transport of plant material in baggage&#x0201d; to be presented to customs, with the definition of the &#x0201c;risk routes&#x0201d; and preparation of a dedicated control system. Attention should be paid to the implementing act of EU Reg. 2031/2016, which must clear the application content of art. 75 (on &#x0201c;exceptions for travelers' baggage&#x0201d;) which provides for the exemption of the phytosanitary certificate, but not of the inspection, for small quantities of certain species for non-professional use, excluding plant plants and certain plant products from any third country, an article that generates a certain ambiguity in its application in the various member countries.</p><p id="p0555">As for the risk of import by the production/multiplication structures, the absence of <italic>Xc</italic> in Europe confirms the reliability of the institutional control system on <italic>Rutaceae</italic>. This is partly also the result of a favorable coincidence since <italic>Xc</italic> is present in 62% of the countries in which Huanglongbing is present (or HLB, <italic>yellow branch disease</italic> or <italic>Citrus greening</italic>) and, therefore, specific phytosanitary requirements are often associated with the use of the phytosanitary passport and quarantine procedures.</p><p id="p0560">Ultimately, evaluation based on a multidimensional approach can contribute to the efficiency and effectiveness of the defense against the invasion of <italic>Xcc</italic> in the Mediterranean Basin, considered in its entirety: both in the preparation step, through the identification of resources, the objectives and possible choices, both in the decision-making phase, by choosing the most satisfactory solutions in the set of possible alternatives considered (operational implementation, flexibility and usability of the decisions to be taken).</p><p id="p0565">The multi-criteria analysis carried out with the help of stakeholders has highlighted an interest in &#x0201c;voluntary certification&#x0201d; and the creation of a quarantine area within professional nurseries. This procedure, even if causing an increase in the bureaucracy of the production process and a consequent increase in production costs, could be a tool capable of reassuring the numerous &#x0201c;qualities&#x0201d; of the company/process/product, including product traceability and traceability.</p><p id="p0570">The voluntary offer of greater traceability is in line with:<list list-type="simple" id="ulist0040"><list-item id="u0120"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0575">the provisions of the new regulatory framework on plant health surveillance;</p></list-item><list-item id="u0125"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0580">with the strategic choices of the professional nursery company that in recent years has implemented high investments to diversify production, encouraging the affirmation of new production segments that have captured the interest of new consumers;</p></list-item><list-item id="u0130"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0585">with the need to protect the territory, ornamental Rutaceae and commercial species.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="p0590">Voluntary certification also serves to overcome a shortcoming of the EU Implementing Regulation 2019/2072 that establishes uniform conditions for the implementation of EU Reg. 2016/2031, which in the case of Xc does not affect trade in "parts of plants intended for propagation (cuttings)".</p><p id="p0595">Ultimately it is necessary to pursue:<list list-type="simple" id="ulist0045"><list-item id="u0135"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0600">a greater collaboration between the Control Bodies;</p></list-item><list-item id="u0140"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0605">an improved operator training;</p></list-item><list-item id="u0145"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0610">the creation of a rapid alert system (TRACE - EUROPHTY, etc.);</p></list-item><list-item id="u0150"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0615">the definition of strict control procedures for electronic commerce and postal deliveries;</p></list-item><list-item id="u0155"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0620">the collection of research resources;</p></list-item><list-item id="u0160"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0625">the revision of the system of derogations for &#x0201c;small producers&#x0201d; (art. 65), also because of the EU regulation 2016/2031 leaves freedom to the Member States (for example, by committing them to guarantee the traceability of products/voluntary certification).</p></list-item></list></p><p id="p0630">The limitations of the current research consist in the fact that the empirical verification was carried out exclusively in one area of the Mediterranean Basin, Sicily. Although this area has a central and strategic position in southern Europe for both the production and the marketing of the various species of ornamental rutaceae, it may not be exhaustive for the treatment of phytosanitary problems.</p><p id="p0635">Future research developments will go in the both in the direction of verification of assumptions in other territorial contexts in the Mediterranean Basin (France, Spain and Turkey, at least) and in the direction of the setting up of a voluntary certification protocol, to create a strictly controlled supply chain starting from the propagation material, then to the mother plants up to the plants ready for sale. In this way it will be possible to promote the market of ornamental Rutaceae with the affirmation of diversified production and consumption models.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Declarations</title><sec id="sec6.1"><title>Author contribution statement</title><p id="p0640">Giuseppe Timpanaro; Vera Teresa Foti: Conceived and designed the experiments; Performed the experiments; Analyzed and interpreted the data; Wrote the paper.</p><p id="p0645">Arturo Urso; Alessandro Scuderi: Performed the experiments; Wrote the paper.</p></sec><sec id="sec6.2"><title>Funding statement</title><p id="p0650">This work was supported by the ORPRAMed Project on &#x0201c;Risk assessment of introduction of <italic>Xanthomonas citri</italic> subsp. citri through commercial trade of ornamental rutaceous plants in the Mediterranean Basin&#x0201d;, ERA-NET ARIMNET 2-Call 2015 (dott.ssa Paola Caruso, Consiglio per la Ricerca in agricoltura e l'analisi dell&#x02019;Economia Agraria&#x02013;CREA, scientific coordinator).
