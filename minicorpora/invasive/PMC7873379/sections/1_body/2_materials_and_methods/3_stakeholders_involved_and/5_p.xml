<p id="p0175">Some structures operate on national and/or international markets from/vs EU third countries - intra EU (import/export), others only on local markets. The activities (production and/or trade and/or import of plants or plant products) internationally performed require - however - specific authorization issued by the official phytosanitary services and registration with the official Register of producers, so as to be able to release of the plant passport required by Directive 2000/29/Ce. The passport (in non-EU trade) and the phytosanitary certification (in intra EU trade), guarantee the health status of the goods handled, confirming their traceability, compliance with the appropriate conditions throughout the production and marketing chain and demonstrating the application measures to protect against the introduction into and the spread within the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products. Hence, the system is particularly protective, but some categories of subjects are exempted: among these, the occasional importers of small quantities of plants and their propagation material not destined for sale, and the “small producers”, (i.e. those who produce and sell vegetables and plant products their totality are intended as final use, within the local market, to people or buyers not professionally involved in the production of plants). These categories could represent a potential threat to the community.</p>
