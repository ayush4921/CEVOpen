0: Within this institutional scenario, an exploratory survey was conducted through a direct interview with professional nurserymen working in Sicily (Italy), at the center of the Mediterranean Basin [ 22], in order to acquire some elements of knowledge necessary for the design of a model of public intervention of prevention from the invasion of  Xcc and some basic considerations have emerged: In this institutional system, governed by the legislation previously described, it is possible to affirm that it is unlikely that a living plant can escape checks, even if the prohibition does not exist for all ornamental rutaceae;the import/export of live plants from the areas of the planet in which it was currently reported the presence of     Xcc appears limited to:    low market value of the generality of ornamental species and varieties (2448 month plant) with wholesale prices ranging from  6.50 for 1718 cm pots, up to  12.0012.50 for 2224 cm pots: very small figures to justify an intercontinental import, finding suitable cultivation conditions in the Mediterranean Basin;difficulty in surviving plants for long-distance transport (23 weeks, on average), unless using high-cost unit means (air, controlled temperature and atmosphere, for example);coexistence in the same areas of other types of plant diseases (for example HLB), which would imply for these products the accompaniment of the phytosanitary passport which would benefit, indirectly, also the protection from Xcc, analyzing Rutaceae plants to suitable diagnostic kits;there is currently a different degree of danger of invasion for:    type of nursery, with distinction between professional structure (both medium-large and micro-small size) recognized by phytosanitary services, registered in the regional register, authorized to issue extra EU passport and working with phytosanitary services for the issue of the intra-EU phytosanitary certificate.
1: This structure is unlikely to be exposed to any importation at risk, in order to pursue additional profits.
2: The professional operator, at certain levels of capitalization and productivity, can however delocalize its production activity in order to achieve greater economies of scale and scope, finding suitable environmental conditions and different phytosanitary situations in other areas of the planet.
3: The situation is different for the amateur nursery, which experiences the derogation regime and which can be tempted by the possibility of widening its commercial offer, with imports at risk;      type of rutaceae species, with differences between common ornamental rutaceae (e.g.
4: bitter orange, lemon,        Poncirus trifoliata,        Citrus limonimedica, kumquat or        Fortunella margarita,        Citrus myrtifolia, etc.
5: ), more easily found on the market of the Mediterranean areas, and more from niche (eg        Murraya paniculata,        Citrus mitis,        Coleonema pulchrum,        Poncirus trifoliata,        Zanthoxylum beecheyanum,        Murraya exotica), etc.
6: ;      type of trade, distinguishing between traditional and modern forms, represented by multi-channel, electronic and direct distribution formulas for final consumption.
7: To date, the defense against invasion has been based on two conceptual elements, namely the traceability and control of the supply chain at a physical location.
8: On the supply chain of ornamental plants nowadays and at different levels, electronic commerce is inserted in which the plant or part of the plant (scions, for example) skips some important elements of physical reference, in which the prescribed health checks can be carried out.
9: The consumer can connect directly to platforms, not of production but of intermediation, which offer products of all kinds, even of clear foreign origin, community or non-EU, despite the EU Reg.
10: 625/2017 on official controls.
11: If these are not carried out cross-border, they should nevertheless be carried out starting from a site survey, which has not yet been completed;      the risk degree of spread of     Xcc is mainly linked to propagation material (slips, in particular), easily concealable (in the case of intentional invasion) and potentially able to escape customs controls (especially if placed inside apparent tourists).
12: As it is known, it is possible to obtain seedlings from the multiplied marbles and, therefore, a multitude of plants that can meet one of the following destinies:    remain on the local market and potentially be able to spread        Xcc;      export to the EU market, but in this case they will meet the phytosanitary certification (if to be involved is an authorized nursery, otherwise if the multiplication structure has an exemption, it is potentially able to spread        Xcc);      export to extra-EU markets and, in this case, the plants go to the phytosanitary passport.
