0: There are several multi-criteria models that successfully deal with the problem of managing environmental, economic, and social interventions or their political options since they offer solutions in this regard starting from different points of view and approaches.
1: Each of them has advantages and disadvantages and, therefore, it is not possible to state that there is one method superior to the other.
2: The choice of the multi-criteria approach to be applied is therefore subjective and, in particular, it is a choice that depends on the needs and requirements of the pest risk aspect to be analyzed.
3: Hence, each method has certain properties; functions dependent and/or independent of the characteristics of the different criteria (qualitative and/or quantitative; with the same/different unit of measurement) taken into consideration; takes into account the subjective preferences of the stakeholders through utility functions or alternative systems; and may have been successfully applied to pest risk analysis problems in the past [ 56,  57,  58].
