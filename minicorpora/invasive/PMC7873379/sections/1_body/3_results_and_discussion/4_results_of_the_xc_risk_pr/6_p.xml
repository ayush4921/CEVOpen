<p id="p0515">The voluntary certification can be achieved by means of a voluntary protocol (codified process system verified and controlled by an independent third party) - which actually acts on the bureaucratic load of the production process, raising production costs - and/or creating a quarantine facility within the professional nurseries, so as to offer a commercial product (both for the domestic market and for the foreign market), which reassure on the many “qualities” of the company/process/product, including its traceability. A similar measure becomes effective even in the case where the producing company adopts decentralized production models, with relocations to other areas of the planet where the official requirements become weaker (i.e. areas where

Among other things, the voluntary supply of greater traceability should - as already mentioned - in line with the provisions of the new regulatory framework on phytosanitary surveillance (Regulation 2031/2016), starting from December 14 2019, which among other things provides for the possibility that professional operators will adopt a “Risk Management Plan related to harmful organisms”, plans that must be approved by the competent authority. The new legislation, however, appears to be strict with regard to the requirements for professional operators (not for example, on the total traceability - extended up to the cultivation substrates - and on the obligation to intervene), but with a view to supporting the free market exceptions to products (parts of plants not intended for sale) and non-professional operators, dangerous for a possible invasion of
