<p id="p0555">As for the risk of import by the production/multiplication structures, the absence of 
 <italic>Xc</italic> in Europe confirms the reliability of the institutional control system on 
 <italic>Rutaceae</italic>. This is partly also the result of a favorable coincidence since 
 <italic>Xc</italic> is present in 62% of the countries in which Huanglongbing is present (or HLB, 
 <italic>yellow branch disease</italic> or 
 <italic>Citrus greening</italic>) and, therefore, specific phytosanitary requirements are often associated with the use of the phytosanitary passport and quarantine procedures.
