<p id="p0020">Since every invasion of alien species involves direct and indirect costs and, therefore, private and social costs [
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], the economic impact assessments - necessary as scientific support provided by the International Plant Protection Convention and the World Trade Organization Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary measures - are usually carried out with a qualitative or quantitative approach. The choice is often made to depend on the availability of data and the ability to prepare specific forecasting models, or able to justify the adoption of certain measures [
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], or to support adequate decision-making strategies using the knowledge of the experts for the calibration of models and the evaluation of the potential distribution of an invasion [
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, the procedures used to assess impacts often influence the results of the assessment [
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]; the “Cost-benefit analysis” is used for the purpose, among others, to evaluate the current and future costs and benefits in monetary units associated with a series of alternatives, projects or political instruments to combat environmental damage and the compromise of ecosystem services; the “Cost-Effectiveness Analysis”, for the comparison of different options or management options for the evaluation of the benefits of the control actions of invasive species; the “Multi-Criteria Analysis”, an approach that allows to incorporate multiple dimensions of the effects and to include both qualitative and quantitative information associated with the impacts of invasive species and those relating to the implementation of management responses, so as to overcome the uncertainties related invasion and decision making; the “Development Scenario”, in which the scenarios are plausible alternative descriptions, supported by quantitative indicators [
