0: In this context, it is necessary to consider Citrus Bacterial Canker (CBC), a potentially dangerous phytopathy for the Mediterranean Basin, caused by two similar but taxonomically distinct bacteria:  Xanthomonas citri pv.
1: citri (synonym  X. citri subsp.
2: citri) and  X. citri pv.
3: aurantifolii (synonym  X. fuscans subsp.
4: aurantifolii).
5: As specified in other studies,  X. citri is used to refer to any citrus fruit canker (hyperplasia) produced by  Xanthomonas, whether Asian ( X. citri pv.
6: citri) or South American ( X. citri pv.
7: aurantifolii) groups [ 18,  19,  20,  21,  22].
