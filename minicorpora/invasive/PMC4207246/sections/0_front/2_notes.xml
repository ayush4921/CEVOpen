  <title>Amendments from Version 1</title>
  <p>The second version of our article provides a more precise definition of our hypothesis, and we integrated our hypothesis more into current theory. Throughout the text we also give more examples on when the hypothesis applies and how it can be effectively used for invasive plant species management. To this end, we also amended our reference list by 11 references, which help clarify our statements, concern invasive species management or support our hypothesis. We have incorporated all the minor comments concerning typos and wording. Furthermore, for our case study we added one analysis confirming the difference in climatic niches between native and invasive ranges. We followed a suggestion from Guisan et al. ( 
   <italic>Trends Ecol Evol.</italic> 2014; 29(5): 260–9)  to use ordination techniques, rather than only climatic niche model approaches. The ordination and the resulting niche equivalency and similarity tests can be found in the second version of our Supplementary materials.
