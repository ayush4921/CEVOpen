<p>The key idea of the proposed ‘human release hypothesis’ seems that land management intensity – especially of abandoned or extensively used habitat – can explain differences in the abundance of a species between its native and alien ranges because the abundance of the species might be reduced in the native range through more intensive management of such land and associated cutting of the species. This is an interesting idea because it states that the presence of humans and their effects on landscapes can reduce invasion spread in opposition to traditional thinking that sees human land use mainly as a driver of invasions. The authors propose for instance that differences in land management coverage and intensity might explain why Europe is less invaded than regions with a higher proportion of wildlands such as North America or Australia.</p>
