<p>On this basis, we see two research priorities that should be addressed to further scrutinize the Human Release Hypothesis so that, if appropriate, it can be integrated into invasive species management. First, additional species should be studied in both their native ranges and in different parts of their introduced ranges. Such comparisons would be useful to test the drivers of invasive species abundance and to validate (or refute) invasion patterns derived from modelling approaches

 </sup>. We generated our hypothesis based on findings in Europe, however many invasive plant species on the American continent originate from Asia

 </sup>, thus it would be interesting to test our hypothesis based on land use patterns from these regions. An important first clue that the Human Release Hypothesis may be relevant could be whether invasive individuals of a given perennial species are significantly older than individuals within the native range. Second, it may be useful to further investigate the relationship between landscape maintenance and human land use intensity, how it manifests in different regions, and if generalizations are possible at the global scale. The frequency and timing of weeding and trimming, as well as the prevalence of fallowing, are just two of many potential indicators for the level of active landscape maintenance.
