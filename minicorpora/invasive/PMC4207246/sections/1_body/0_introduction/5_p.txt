0: We first discuss how the Human Release Hypothesis fits into the context of other key hypotheses in invasion ecology.
1: We then illustrate the hypothesis via a case study on a global invader, the sweetbriar rose (  Rosa rubiginosa L.).
2: Finally, we assess how the Human Release Hypothesis may be integrated into biological invasion research, and we hypothesize which locations worldwide may be particularly prone to supporting high abundances of invasive species.
