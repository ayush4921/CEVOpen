0: Within Europe, the distribution of people is strongly related to the number of alien species.
1: Presumably, this reflects that biological invasions are aided by human transport and that species establishment is facilitated by human disturbance  7.
2: Nevertheless, at the global scale, the proportion of widely distributed alien plant species (relative to all species) is far lower in Europe than in North America  despite Europes long history of trade and therefore a longer residence time of alien plants  8.
3: The observation that Europe serves as a global contributor of alien plant species, whereas North America seems to be a better recipient, has sparked the concept of biological resistance, which explains invasion success or failure in relation to the traits of the native flora  9.
4: An additional important consideration, which has not been assessed to date, could be that Europe also has a higher proportion of landscapes that are actively managed by humans than, for example, the Americas, Australia and Africa  10.
5: To date, extensive data on the abundance of invasive alien species is widely lacking.
6: Existing approaches to predict invasion patterns in response to anthropogenic global change have focused primarily on the development of novel ecosystems  11, and alien species richness  12.
7: Based on this, it is now widely acknowledged that systems containing high numbers of alien species tend to be those created and sustained by humans.
