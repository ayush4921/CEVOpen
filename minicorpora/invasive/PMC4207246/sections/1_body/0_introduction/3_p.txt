0: In this paper, we do not focus on species richness.
1: Rather, we propose that the  abundance of an alien species in a given landscape can be (at least partly) explained by the level of active landscape maintenance by humans  that is, the active, continuous and on-going management by people.
2: We term this hypothesis the Human Release Hypothesis.
3: As discussed in detail below, the Human Release Hypothesis states that the abundance of invasive species may be partly explained by the level of human activity or landscape maintenance, with intermediate levels of human activity providing optimal conditions for high abundance.
4: We define intermediate levels of human activity as activity patterns defined by sporadic disturbance events that are followed by long periods lacking active management, such as fallowing or abandonment.
5: In contrast, regions with high levels of human activity frequently experience active management, such as weeding, hedge trimming or mowing of field margins.
