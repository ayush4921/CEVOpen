 </sup>, an invasive terrestrial plant species is a naturalized alien species that produces reproductive offspring, often in very large numbers, at considerable distance from parent plants, and thus has the potential to spread over extensive areas. A key question in invasion ecology is how the interaction of species traits with environmental characteristics predicts invasion success, including both establishment and abundance in the new environment
