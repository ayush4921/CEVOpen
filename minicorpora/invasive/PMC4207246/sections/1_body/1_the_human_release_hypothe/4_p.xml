<p>With respect to abiotic conditions, invasion is facilitated if species are pre-adapted to their new environment, for example due to a similar climate in the new environment

 </sup>. Like propagule pressure, pre-adaption is not a necessary precondition for successful invasion, because climatic niche shifts have been reported for invasive species

 <sup>

 </sup>. Many invasive plant species are adapted to exploit temporarily favourable conditions through their short life cycles, rapid growth, high reproductive allocation, persistent soil seed banks and rapid germination (the Ideal Weed Hypothesis)

 </sup>. All these traits are also of advantage in systems where frequent weeding or mowing is practiced. Therefore, species pursuing this competitive ruderal strategy could profit twofold from Human Release.
