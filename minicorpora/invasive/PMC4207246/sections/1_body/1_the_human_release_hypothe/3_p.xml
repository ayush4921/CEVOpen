<p>So far, human influence has been recognized as a mediating influence on the process of invasion, but not as a key of the abundance of invasive species. Human influence thus has been considered primarily during the establishment stage. For example, human action can increase propagule pressure

 </sup> and multiple introduction events make establishment more likely, because species have a higher chance to encounter suitable environmental conditions

 </sup>. At this stage of the invasion process large-scale planting of alien species could also contribute to the abundance of invasive species, as demonstrated for tree species 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
 </sup>. Multiple introductions of the same species also can lead to higher genetic diversity 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
 </sup>. However, examples exist of successful invaders with low genetic diversity 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
 </sup>, and stemming from single or few introduction events, suggesting that propagule pressure is only one of many variables explaining invasion patterns
