0: Twenty to thirty  P. australis patches were identified in the most recent set of aerial images available for each site, and digitized in ArcMAP 10.1 (ESRI, Redlands, CA).
1: The existence of those patches was verified during field visits to the sites.
2: Patches were then followed backward in time through a series of aerial images to the early 1980s or until they were no longer visible on the images.
3: Only those patches which were present in the oldest set of imagery were considered in this study.
4: The number of focal patches within each site averaged 8.151.14 (mean  SE; range: 216,  Table 1).
5: Annual growth rate per patch was determined as the proportional change in area per year:  ln [(final patch area/initial patch area)]/number of years  [31].
6: Clonal growth is expected to be the primary means of  P. australis patch expansion  [33] but we cannot rule out the contribution of sexual reproduction  [34].
7: For each marsh site, an average growth rate was computed from the collection of focal patches.
