<p>Twenty to thirty 
 <italic>P. australis</italic> patches were identified in the most recent set of aerial images available for each site, and digitized in ArcMAP 10.1 (ESRI, Redlands, CA). The existence of those patches was verified during field visits to the sites. Patches were then followed backward in time through a series of aerial images to the early 1980s or until they were no longer visible on the images. Only those patches which were present in the oldest set of imagery were considered in this study. The number of focal patches within each site averaged 8.15±1.14 (mean ± SE; range: 2–16,
