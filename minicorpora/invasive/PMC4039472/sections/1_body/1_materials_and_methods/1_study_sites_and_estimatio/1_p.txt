0: We selected 13 freshwater-to-brackish marshes distributed along the Gulf and Atlantic Coasts of the US that were occupied by one of two non-indigenous haplotypes of  P. australis that exhibit both aggressive patterns of local spread and range expansion  [22],  [25] [27] ( Figure 1,  Table 1).
1: Because patches of native haplotypes are difficult to distinguish from the background marsh vegetation in historical aerial images (GP Bhattarai, JT Cronin, WJ Allen, LA Meyerson unpublished data), the native haplotypes were excluded from this study.
2: We selected relatively undisturbed open marsh habitats where  P. australis was at early stage of invasion and had the potential to grow.
3: Eight of our sites were located in protected areas (wildlife refuges, management areas and state parks) but all 13 sites were relatively undisturbed during the study period.
4: All sites along the Atlantic coast and four sites in Louisiana were occupied by introduced Eurasian haplotype.
5: The remaining four sites (one in Florida, one in Alabama, and two in Louisiana) were occupied by a non-native Gulf-Coast haplotype.
