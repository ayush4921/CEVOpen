0: Within each site, we selected a 125 km 2 area within the interior of the marsh that contained discrete  P. australis patches ( Table 1).
1: Patches within this area were unconstrained by any physical barriers to expansion (e.g., roads, bodies of water, agricultural lands, marsh edges).
2: These dense and usually circular patches of  P. australis were readily identifiable in aerial images (color, color-infrared and black-and-white images) because of their distinct color and texture against the background marsh vegetation  [31],  [32].
