0: One of the objectives of this study was to evaluate whether  P. australis growth rates were influenced more by large-scale storm events than by local climatic conditions.
1: To this end, the following climate data for each site were obtained from the BIOCLIM database  [40]: annual mean temperature, isothermality (mean of monthly [maximum temperature  minimum temperature]/annual temperature range), temperature seasonality (standard deviation of weekly mean temperatures), maximum temperature of warmest month, minimum temperature of coldest month, temperature annual range, annual precipitation, precipitation seasonality (standard deviation of weekly mean precipitation estimates expressed as the percentage of mean of those estimates), precipitation of wettest quarter, and precipitation of driest quarter.
2: A principal component analysis was run to reduce the dimensionality of climatic data.
3: The first two principal components, which explained 94.8% and 5.01% variability of the climatic data respectively, were used in our model-selection procedure.
