0: We used wind speed as an indicator of the strength of the storm as a disturbance to  P. australis.
1: Data on other disturbances associated with tropical storms and hurricanes (e.g., storm surge, change in salinity, nutrient levels, deposition of silt and wrack) are mostly unavailable.
2: However, it is likely for coastal marshes that wind speed is correlated with these other variables.
