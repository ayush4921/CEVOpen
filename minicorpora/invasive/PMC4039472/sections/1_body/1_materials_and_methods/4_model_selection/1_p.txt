0: We examined the effects of latitude, initial patch size, climatic variables (PC1 and PC2), frequency of tropical storms, and frequency of hurricanes on growth rate of  P. australis patches.
1: Using general linear models in Systat 12 (Systat Inc., Chicago, IL), we developed statistical models using all combinations of latitude ( x  1), initial patch size ( x  2), PC1 ( x  3), PC2 ( x  4), frequencies of tropical storms ( x  5) and hurricanes ( x  6).
2: The best model was selected using corrected Akaike weights  [41] ( Table S1).
3: The time interval over which  P. australis growth was measured for each site ( P = 0.11) and intensity of hurricanes (sum total of hurricane categories [15; Saffir-Simpson scale]) ( P = 0.71) did not have a significant effect on growth rates of patches.
4: Therefore, we did not include them in analysis.
5: Examination of the standardized residuals in our best model showed that one of the data points was an outlier (Intracoastal City, LA).
6: Removal of that point in the analysis improved the fit of the model to the data ( F2,9 = 36.53,  P = 0.001,  R2 = 0.89).
7: Because we have no reason to conclude that this data point is spurious, we retained it in our analysis.
