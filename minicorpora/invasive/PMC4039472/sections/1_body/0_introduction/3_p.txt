0: We studied the effect of storm and hurricane activities on the growth of patches of common reed,  Phragmites australis, in the coastal wetlands of the eastern United States of America.
1: Indigenous and/or introduced haplotypes (based on a microsatellite analysis of chloroplast DNA) of  P. australis are found on all continents except for Antarctica, and in some cases the introduced haplotypes are recognized as aggressive invaders  [22],  [23].
2: Historically,  P. australis has been an uncommon species of the wetlands of North America for millennia  [24].
3: In the past 150 years, an introduced Eurasian haplotype has spread rapidly in both coastal and inland marsh ecosystems of North America, particularly near the Atlantic Coast  [22].
4: An additional haplotype that most likely originated in Africa and is present in all of the Gulf Coast states (Gulf-Coast haplotype)  [25] is also spreading locally and expanding its range to the southwestern US  [26],  [27].
5: It is unclear whether this haplotypes appearance into the Gulf Coast region was facilitated by human activities or the result of a natural range expansion from Central and South America.
6: Other non-native haplotypes of  P. australis are present in North America, but they appear to have very restricted distributions (particularly, within the Mississippi River Delta)  [25].
7: Marshes that have been invaded by  P. australis have been characterized by the loss of native plant species, reduced diversity and altered composition of associated faunal communities, and changed ecosystem processes such as nutrient cycling and hydrological regimes  [28] [30].
