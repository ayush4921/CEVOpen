0: In spite of the serious ecological and economic impacts of  P. australis invasion, almost nothing is known about the factors responsible for the continent-scale patterns of spread of these invasive haplotypes in North America.
1: Using historical aerial images (spanning 527 years), we determined the growth rate of  P. australis patches within each of 13 marsh sites (9 inhabited by the Eurasian and 4 inhabited by the Gulf-Coast haplotype) distributed along the Gulf and Atlantic Coasts of the US ( Figure 1,  Table 1).
2: For each site, we estimated wind speeds of all storms, counting only those that qualified as a tropical or subtropical storm (maximum sustained wind speeds of 65119 km/h) or hurricane (119 km/h).
3: By dividing storms into these two wind-speed categories, we were able to test the  a priori prediction that growth rates of  P. australis patches were more strongly related to the frequency of more intense storms.
