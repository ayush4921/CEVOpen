<p>Alterations of habitat characteristics by natural and anthropogenic disturbances, or change in disturbance regimes, are quite often associated with invasion success

 <xref rid="pone.0098478-Diez1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Large scale disturbance events such as hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons have long been associated with the establishment and spread of invasive species

 <xref rid="pone.0098478-Bellingham1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. However, to date, few studies have considered whether the history of such extreme disturbance events has influenced invasion success at local scales 
 <xref rid="pone.0098478-Bradley1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0098478-Diez1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, and no studies have addressed whether these types of disturbances affect the patterns of establishment and spread at regional or continental spatial scales. For example, in the northern hemisphere historical patterns of spread of invasive species may be greater in the south where hurricanes are more frequent and intense than in the north. As such, range expansion and spread of an invader may be driven by disturbance regimes. The relevance of studying hurricane effects on the establishment and spread of invasive species is magnified by the expectation that hurricane activity, particularly high-intensity hurricanes, may increase with global climate change
