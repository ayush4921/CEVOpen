0: Alterations of habitat characteristics by natural and anthropogenic disturbances, or change in disturbance regimes, are quite often associated with invasion success  [13] [15].
1: Disturbances benefit invasive species by reducing competition with resident species and increasing resource availability  [13],  [16].
2: Large scale disturbance events such as hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons have long been associated with the establishment and spread of invasive species  [17],  [18].
3: However, to date, few studies have considered whether the history of such extreme disturbance events has influenced invasion success at local scales  [7],  [16], and no studies have addressed whether these types of disturbances affect the patterns of establishment and spread at regional or continental spatial scales.
4: For example, in the northern hemisphere historical patterns of spread of invasive species may be greater in the south where hurricanes are more frequent and intense than in the north.
5: As such, range expansion and spread of an invader may be driven by disturbance regimes.
6: The relevance of studying hurricane effects on the establishment and spread of invasive species is magnified by the expectation that hurricane activity, particularly high-intensity hurricanes, may increase with global climate change  [19] [21].
