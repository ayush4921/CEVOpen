<p>Many of our most notable species invasions have occurred or are occurring at continent-wide scales. To date, studies of these biological invasions have rarely considered the possibility that large-scale phenomena may underlie geographic variation in invader establishment and spread. Recent studies on the effects of global climate change on biological invasions

 <xref rid="pone.0098478-Cheung1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> are an important step in the right direction but clearly more attention needs to be paid to other large-scale climatic disturbances (e.g., storms, droughts) and their effects on all types of invasive species, not just plants.
