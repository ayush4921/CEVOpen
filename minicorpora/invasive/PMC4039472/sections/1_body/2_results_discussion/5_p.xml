<p>A high priority in the future should be a comparison of the growth rates of native and the European exotic haplotypes in response to large-scale disturbance events. Native haplotypes are found in coastal marshes from North Carolina to Canada (
 <xref rid="pone.0098478-Saltonstall1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>; JT Cronin, GP Bhattarai, WJ Allen, LA Meyerson unpublished data) and are present in four of our study sites (North Carolina, Delaware, New Jersey and Connecticut). In general, patches of native haplotypes are rare (in terms of area of coverage) and are thought to be disappearing, in part, due to the invasion of exotic
