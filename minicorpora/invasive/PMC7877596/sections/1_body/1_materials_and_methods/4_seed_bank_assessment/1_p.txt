0: The seed bank was assessed at both plots in April 2017 (in autumn, after seed dispersal but before germination).
1: At each sampling point, 10 soil samples were taken at random per plot (roadside and reference area), giving a total of 60 soil samples.
2: Each sample measured 8.5 cm in diameter and 3 cm in depth.
3: The samples were stratified in a refrigerator (at 5C) for 3 months.
4: After this time, they were sieved to eliminate stones and plants remaining before being placed in containers on a substrate of sterile sand (for 2 days at 100C) to promote water drainage [ 43,  50].
5: Finally, they were put in a greenhouse under conditions of controlled irrigation.
6: Over the next 10 months the seedlings were counted and identified every week using a regional seedling identification guide [ 51].
7: Seedlings which could not be identified were transplanted for later identification through observation of their reproductive structures [ 52].
