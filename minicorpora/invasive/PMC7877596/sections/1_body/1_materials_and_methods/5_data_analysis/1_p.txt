0: Plants from the vegetation and seed banks were identified at species level and classified according to their origin (native, endemic and exotic) in the Southern Cone, composed of the countries Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay and southern Brazil [ 35,  53].
1: The exotic species were classified as invasive using The Global Invasive Species Database [ 54], Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species [ 55], and local bibliography [ 56].
2: The frequency of different botanical families (exotic plus native) present in the vegetation and seed bank was analyzed for the roadsides (RS) and reference areas (RA), as well as exotic and native species separately for the RS and RA.
3: The species were classified into three functional groups based on their life form and life cycle: annual/biannual herbs and grasses (Group I); perennial herbs and grasses (Group II); and shrubs (Group III) [ 43].
4: Finally, the type of fruit or seed dispersal (anemochory, autochory and zoochory) was determined for each species [ 36,  52].
