<p>To compare total cover and the cover of native and exotic species, functional groups, and the most abundant species (distinguishing between native and exotic) between RS and RA and for each plot, we used generalized linear mixed models (glmmTMB—R package “glmmTMB”) with a Beta distribution [
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. In these models cover was included as a response variable. In the comparisons between RS and RA, plot (roadside, reference area) was taken as the explanatory variable, and for comparisons within each plot, origin (native, exotic), functional groups, or the most abundant species were taken as explanatory variables, and the sampling points as a random effect.
