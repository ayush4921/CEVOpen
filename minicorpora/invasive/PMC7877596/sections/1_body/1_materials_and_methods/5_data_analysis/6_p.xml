<p>The SÃ¸rensen index was used to calculate similarity of species composition between the vegetation and the soil seed bank in RS and RA. The following formula was used: 
 <italic>2a/(2a + b + c)</italic>, where 
 <italic>a</italic> is the number of species common to both the vegetation and the seed bank, 
 <italic>b</italic> is the number of species exclusive to the vegetation, and 
 <italic>c</italic> is the number of species exclusive to the seed bank. Furthermore, species similarity was calculated between the roadsides and the reference areas for the vegetation and the seed bank. In this case 
 <italic>a</italic> is the number of species common to both the roadsides and the reference areas, 
 <italic>b</italic> is the number of species exclusive to the roadsides and 
 <italic>c</italic> is the number of species exclusive to the reference areas [
