0: The Srensen index was used to calculate similarity of species composition between the vegetation and the soil seed bank in RS and RA.
1: The following formula was used:  2a/(2a + b + c), where  a is the number of species common to both the vegetation and the seed bank,  b is the number of species exclusive to the vegetation, and  c is the number of species exclusive to the seed bank.
2: Furthermore, species similarity was calculated between the roadsides and the reference areas for the vegetation and the seed bank.
3: In this case  a is the number of species common to both the roadsides and the reference areas,  b is the number of species exclusive to the roadsides and  c is the number of species exclusive to the reference areas [ 49].
