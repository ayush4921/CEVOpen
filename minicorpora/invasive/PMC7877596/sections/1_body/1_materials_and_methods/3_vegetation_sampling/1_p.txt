0: In December of 2016 (spring), at each sampling point 15 quadrats of 1m 2 were placed at random in each plot (roadside and reference area) to determine species composition, cover, and richness (3 sampling points x 2 plots x 15 quadrats) ( Fig 1).
1: Species cover was estimated in each quadrat using the Braun-Blanquet scale [ 49].
2: In addition, all species present within a distance of 1 m from each side of the quadrat were recorded.
