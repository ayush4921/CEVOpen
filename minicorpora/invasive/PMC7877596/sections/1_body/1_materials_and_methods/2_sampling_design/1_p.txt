0: Three sampling points were selected along the highway, separated from one another by about 2 km.
1: At each point we selected two different plots 5 m wide and 50 m long parallel to the road.
2: The first one (Roadside plot) was adjacent to the road and had similar environmental conditions (north orientation, slope less than 45), and the second one (Reference area plot) was located 20 m from the road within the grassland ( Fig 1).
3: Typically, these highways have roadsides with an artificial slope caused by ground levelling during road construction, and fencing that separates it from the surrounding area.
4: Sampling was performed on roadsides that had not been previously restored or rehabilitated, and in the neighboring steppe matrix where livestock farming is practiced.
5: Extensive livestock farming has been the most important productive activity in the region since the beginning of last century [ 48].
