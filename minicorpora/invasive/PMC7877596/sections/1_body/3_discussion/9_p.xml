<p>The functional groups that contributed most seeds to the roadside seed bank were the native and exotic annual/biannual herbs and grasses and exotic perennial herbs. These functional groups were represented by diverse species that form persistent seed banks [
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The persistent seed banks of invasive exotic species are a long-term legacy [
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. In the reference areas exotic perennial herbs and grasses and native annual herbs also dominated, represented by 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>acetosella</italic> and 
 <italic>Heliotropium paronychioides</italic>, respectively. The seed banks of the steppe tend to contain a high number of exotic perennial herbs [
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Exotic shrubs were not recorded in the seed bank of roadsides and reference areas. 
 <italic>Rosa rubiginosa</italic> was the only exotic shrub found in aboveground vegetation and with very low cover, therefore the probability of finding seeds in the soil is also low. The predominance of 
 <italic>H</italic>. 
 <italic>paronychioides</italic> in the seed banks of the roadsides and reference areas is related to the ovoid shape and small size of its seeds, which enable it to form seed banks [
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. This species was found in the seed bank but not in the vegetation of the reference areas, suggesting that its germination was favoured by the resource release produced by disturbances such as those that occur at the roadsides; it was also found in abundance after fires [
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>].
