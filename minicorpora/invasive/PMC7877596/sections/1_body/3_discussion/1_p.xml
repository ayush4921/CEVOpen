<p>This study contributes to the research in invasion ecology and the role of roads on the dispersal of exotic species by providing spatial (roadside vs reference area) and temporal (vegetation vs seed bank) information for assessing plant invasions in the northwest Patagonian region. Our study found that the predominant plants in the vegetation and seed bank were exotic perennial and annual herbs with different types of dispersal. It also found that there was limited expansion of exotic species further from the roads, probably attributed to the low frequency of disturbance that generate resource release (e.g. space and light) and to species traits (e.g. competitive ability).</p>
