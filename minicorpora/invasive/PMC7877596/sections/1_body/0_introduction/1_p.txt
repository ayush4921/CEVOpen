0: The introduction of alien species represents one of the major threats to biodiversity at a global level [ 1].
1: Exotic species can transform a habitat, affecting biodiversity on different spatial scales, contributing to species extinction [ 2] and creating severe challenges in terms of their management and control [ 3].
2: Their effect on biodiversity, health and the economy is so great that the control and management of invasive species has become the principal objective of numerous restoration studies [ 4].
3: Once successfully introduced outside their natural range, potentially invasive exotic plant species can propagate in the new environment if their ecological needs are met, establishing self-sustaining populations [ 5].
