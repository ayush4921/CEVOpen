0: Assessing the functional composition of communities enables us to compare assembly processes between studies in different regions and on different scales [ 41,  42].
1: Classification of plant species into functional groups according to their life cycle and life form can be applied to the study of ecological processes, such as the dispersal, colonization and establishment of species at roadsides [ 8].
2: In general, the species that colonize roadsides are short-lived, monocarpic annual or perennial species [ 23,  37].
3: In northwest Patagonia, the response of different functional groups to disturbances such as fire, volcanic eruption, and drought have been much studied [ 43,  44]; however, in this region no research has been carried out on colonization of the roadside habitat by the different functional groups.
4: Analyzing functional groups enables to draw more general conclusions on assembly process compared to species-specific analysis.
