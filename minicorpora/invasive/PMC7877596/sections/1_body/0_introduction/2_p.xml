<p>The construction of highways and roads produces considerable changes in natural communities due to plant cover elimination and soil removal, two types of disturbance that expose soils to wind and water erosion, and alter drainage, the nutrient cycle and the level of resources [
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. More homogeneous habitats are thus created at the roadsides, affecting microclimatic conditions and causing considerable reduction in competition, where fast-growing ruderal species with high seed production generally become established, many of which are exotic [
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These habitats may represent a starting point for the dispersal of some exotic species, enabling them to spread and extend their distribution to non-degraded natural habitats [
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The composition, richness and abundance of species at the roadsides therefore differ from natural areas [

 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Furthermore, the lineal structure of a road and the capacity of vehicles to disperse weed seeds [
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] can promote and accelerate the processes of dispersal and invasion of exotic species, extending their distribution on a regional scale [
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Nevertheless, the colonizing potential of a species and its persistence in the invaded environment depend on its ability to overcome environmental and dispersal barriers, aspects which are related to its reproductive and dispersal characteristics [
