<p>The dispersal of seeds from areas with natural vegetation close to the roadsides, and their incorporation into the seed bank are important processes, since they allow natural colonization [

 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In areas which have been fragmented due to the presence of roads, long-distance dispersal is a crucial process for species persistence on a regional scale and the spread of invasive exotic species [
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. A species whose fruits or seeds present structures such as plumed pappus, wings or hooks that enable them to be transported by wind (anemochory) or animals (zoochory) can extend their distribution more easily than a species that lacks propagules with these characteristics [
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Seed dispersal also depends on seed traits (i.e., seed mass, shape and size), which enable them to be carried over long distances attached to vehicle tires and clothing [

 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In European Mediterranean environments, for example, the species that colonize roadside areas mainly present fruits or seeds with anemochorous dispersal structures, other types being less common (zoochory, ballochory, barochory, etc.) [
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Many of these species belong to the 
 <italic>Asteraceae</italic> and 
 <italic>Poaceae</italic> families, which produce large quantities of seeds adapted for wind dispersal [

 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Since long-distance dispersal is recognized as one of the most important processes in determining invasion success [

 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], the study of the types of dispersal of exotic species established on roadsides is essential.
