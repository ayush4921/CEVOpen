0: In Argentine Patagonia a great number of exotic plant species have been introduced since the beginning of the last century, principally from the Palearctic region (Holarctic Kingdom), as a result of European immigration [ 33].
1: In this region it is important to study the presence and distribution of exotic species, since the natural communities have a high level of endemism (i.e., of 2400 species, 300 are endemic, belonging to 15 endemic genera) [ 34].
2: In particular, the flora of northwest Patagonia contains approximately 300 species of exotic plants, equivalent to 20% of the total number of species in the region [ 35].
3: A study of floristic composition in the north of Argentine Patagonia, carried out on a west-east precipitation gradient that included areas of forest, shrubland and steppe, revealed that the shrubland and steppe had the highest presence of exotic species, the most frequent being  Bromus tectorum,  Cerastium arvense and  Rumex acetosella [ 36].
4: A large number of studies in the world have assessed the influence of roads on exotic plant dispersal and establishment in aboveground vegetation [ 9,  11,  13,  37,  38], but soil seed bank on roadsides have been less examined [ 27,  39].
5: In particular these topics have been under-researched in Patagonian steppe roadsides [ 26,  40].
