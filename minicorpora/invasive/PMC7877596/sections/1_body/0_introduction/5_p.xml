<p>In Argentine Patagonia a great number of exotic plant species have been introduced since the beginning of the last century, principally from the Palearctic region (Holarctic Kingdom), as a result of European immigration [
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In this region it is important to study the presence and distribution of exotic species, since the natural communities have a high level of endemism (i.e., of 2400 species, 300 are endemic, belonging to 15 endemic genera) [
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In particular, the flora of northwest Patagonia contains approximately 300 species of exotic plants, equivalent to 20% of the total number of species in the region [
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. A study of floristic composition in the north of Argentine Patagonia, carried out on a west-east precipitation gradient that included areas of forest, shrubland and steppe, revealed that the shrubland and steppe had the highest presence of exotic species, the most frequent being

 <italic>Cerastium arvense</italic> and 
 <italic>Rumex acetosella</italic> [
