0: The objective of the present study was to examine the assembly process of the plant communities to determine whether the roadsides of the steppe in northwest Patagonia constitute a reservoir and dispersal source of invasive exotic species.
1: To this end, the composition of the native and exotic species and functional groups in the established vegetation and seed banks were analyzed for the roadsides and for neighboring areas.
2: The type of dispersal of the exotic and native species present at the roadsides was also studied.
3: Our hypothesis is that the altered areas at the roadsides present conditions for the colonization and later spread of exotic species.
4: We predict that at the roadsides the vegetation cover and seed density in the soil seed bank of exotic species will be higher than the cover and seed density of native plants.
5: Therefore, low similarity in species composition of vegetation and seed bank between roadsides and neighboring areas is expected.
6: With respect to functional groups, we predict that the cover and seed density of annual and short-lived perennial herbs will be higher at the roadsides than in neighboring areas.
7: We predict that species with anemochorous dispersal will be more successful at roadsides, because their seeds can be dispersed over long distances.
8: The knowledge of the floristic composition of roadside vegetation allows the identification of exotic species to be controlled, as well as pioneer native species suitable for reintroduction that provides information for the design of specific restoration protocols [ 16,  45,].
