 <caption> Vegetation cover, density of seeds in the seed bank and functional groups in the roadsides and references areas. Mean vegetation cover ± SE at roadsides and reference areas of: (A) total, exotic and native species; (B) the most abundant exotic species: Rumex acetosella (Ra), Bromus tectorum (Bt), Epilobium brachycarpum (Eb), and native species: Acaena splendens (As), Senecio bracteolatus (Sb) and Azorella prolifera (Ap); (C) functional groups (GI = annual/biannual herbs and grasses, GII = perennial herbs and grasses, GIII = perennial shrubs). Mean seed density ± SE at roadsides and reference areas of: (D) total, exotic and native species; (E) the most abundant exotic species: R. acetosella (Ra), E. brachycarpum (Eb), Verbascum thapsus (Vt), and native species: Heliotropium paronychioides (Hp), A. splendens (As) and Juncus stipulatus (Js); (F) functional groups. *indicates significant differences between cover (total, exotic and native), seed density (total, exotic and native), vegetation cover and seed density of the most abundant species and functional groups between roadsides and reference areas ( P &lt; 0.05). Lower-case letters indicate significant differences between vegetation cover and seed density of native and exotic species, vegetation cover and seed density of the most abundant species and functional groups at roadsides ( P &lt; 0.05). Capital letters represent significant differences between vegetation cover and seed density of native and exotic species, vegetation cover and seed density of the most abundant species and functional groups at reference areas ( P &lt; 0.05). </caption>
