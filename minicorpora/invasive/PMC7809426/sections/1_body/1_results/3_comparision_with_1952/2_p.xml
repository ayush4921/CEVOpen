<p id="Par12">Overall, there was a positive correlation between the frequency of occurrence for the 47 plant taxa between the two collection dates of 1952 and 2017 (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">4</xref>; Kendall’s τ correlation coefficient τ = 0.389, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). There were however, significant differences between 1952 and 2017 in the frequency of the major taxa, classed as predominant and secondary (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>; LR
 <sub>125, 1</sub> = 93.16, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.001), while no significant difference was found between sampling locations (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">5</xref>; LR
 <sub>37, 88</sub> = 508.0, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.944). Of the nine plant taxa returned as major taxa for honeybees in both 1952 and 2017, and present in over 1% of samples, seven of these plants show significant differences in use. This corresponds to differences in their frequency within the landscape as measured by the Countryside Survey (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The top forage found in 1952, white clover (
 <italic>Trifolium repens</italic>), was reported as a major plant in 74% of honey samples, decreasing to 31% in 2017 (
 <italic>x</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 229.51, d.f = 1, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Red clover (
 <italic>Trifolium pratense</italic>) also decreased in use from 5% of honey samples to 1% (
 <italic>x</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 11.18, d.f = 1, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.027). Based on the Countryside Survey, 
 <italic>Trifolium repens</italic> decreased in the landscape by 13% and 
 <italic>T. pratense</italic> by 27% between 1978 and 2007.
