0: Any wax was removed using sterile forceps and DNA was extracted from 10 g of honey using a modified version of the DNeasy Plant Mini extraction kit (Qiagen).
1: Firstly, the 10 g of honey was made up to 30 ml with molecular grade water and incubated in a water bath at 65 C for 30 min.
2: Samples were then centrifuged (Sorvall RC-5B) for 30 min at 15,000 rpm, the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet resuspended in 400 L of a buffer made from a mix of 400 L AP1 from the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen), 80 L proteinase K (1 mg/ml) (Sigma) and 1 L RNase A (Qiagen).
3: This was incubated again for 60 min at 65 C in a water bath and then disrupted using a TissueLyser II (Qiagen) for 4 min at 30 Hz with 3 mm tungsten carbide beads.
4: The remaining steps were carried out according to the manufacturers protocol, excluding the use of the QIAshredder and the second wash stage.
5: The extracted DNA was purified using the OneStep PCR Inhibitor Removal Kit (Zymo Research) and diluted 1 in 10.
