0: We completed a spatial eigenfunction analysis using distance-based Morans eigenvectors.
1: Morans Eigenvector Maps were computed using the mem function from the adespatial package.
2: Morans I was computed for each taxa using the moran.randtest, with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing.
3: The direction of autocorrelation (positive and negative) was tested using the moranNP.randtest function, using the adespatial package in R.
