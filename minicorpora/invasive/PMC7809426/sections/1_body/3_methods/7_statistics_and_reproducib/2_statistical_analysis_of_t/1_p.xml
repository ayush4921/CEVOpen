<p id="Par45">Abundance classes were assigned based on the percentage of reads returned for the two DNA regions 
 <italic>rbcL</italic> and ITS2, matching the classifications used in melissopalynology. Plant taxa represented by over 45% of reads were designated 
 <italic>predominant</italic> for that sample; between 15 and 45% were 
 <italic>secondary</italic>; between 1 and 15% were 
 <italic>important minor</italic> taxa, and &lt;1% of reads were classed as 
 <italic>minor</italic> taxa. The number of times each taxon occurred at each level of abundance was then calculated, with the sum of this giving the frequency of occurrence across all the samples.
