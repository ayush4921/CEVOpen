0: To compare the major taxa (classed as predominant and secondary) between 2017 and 1952, the effect of sample location (UK county name) and sample year (2017 or 1952) were included in a two-tailed generalized linear model using the manyglm function in the package mvabund 50.
1: In the absence of latitude and longitude for honey samples collected in 1952, UK ceremonial county names were used as a proxy for the location for both 2017 and 1952 honey samples.
2: Honey samples from 2017 were assigned their ceremonial county based on latitude and longitude and matched to the counties listed in 1952.
3: Using a binomial distribution, the effect of county location and year (1952 and 2017) were included as explanatory variables in the model and the presence or absence of each taxa was set as the response variable.
4: The appropriateness of the models was checked by visual inspection of the residuals against predicted values from the models (Supplementary Fig.
5: 11).
