0: Abundance classes were assigned based on the percentage of reads returned for the two DNA regions  rbcL and ITS2, matching the classifications used in melissopalynology.
1: Plant taxa represented by over 45% of reads were designated  predominant for that sample; between 15 and 45% were  secondary; between 1 and 15% were  important minor taxa, and<1% of reads were classed as  minor taxa.
2: The number of times each taxon occurred at each level of abundance was then calculated, with the sum of this giving the frequency of occurrence across all the samples.
