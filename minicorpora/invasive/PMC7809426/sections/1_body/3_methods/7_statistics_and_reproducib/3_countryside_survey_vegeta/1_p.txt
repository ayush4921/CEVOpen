0: Changes in the local frequency of the major plant forage species found in both 1952 and 2017 were assessed using the Countryside Survey data from 1978 to 2007 51  53.
1: In 1978, the survey looked at 256 1 km squares within which fixed plots were established, representing fields and unenclosed land (200 m 2) as well as linear features including hedgerows, streams and roadsides (10 m 2).
2: In each plot, a list of all vascular plants was recorded.
3: Where possible, squares and plots were then revisited in 2007, representing 236 1 km squares containing 1577 plots.
4: For these revisited plots, the percentage change in plot frequency was calculated 54.
