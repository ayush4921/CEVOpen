0: In 1952, 855 honey samples were characterised from 66 counties across the UK and Ireland using melissopalynology 15,  16.
1: The methods reported for the research conducted in 1952 are described here fully for comparison.
2: Samples were obtained via a general appeal and were all collected during the honey season of 1952.
3: For each honey sample, ~200 pollen grains were identified using the morphology of the pollen under the microscope, following a standardised protocol 42.
4: To extract the pollen, 10 g of honey was dissolved in 20 ml of distilled water, from which 10 ml was taken and centrifuged at ~2000 rpm for one minute.
5: The supernatant was discarded, and the sediment retained, and then the process was repeated for the remaining liquid.
6: From the sediment, a drop was transferred to a glass slide and spread out over an area of 1 cm 2, before being stained with fuchsin and dried.
7: Euparal vert was used as a final mounting medium.
8: Pollen was identified by comparison with a reference library of pollen preparations and available pollen morphological data 43,  44.
9: Each plant taxon found in the sampled honey was reported according to the proportion of pollen grains found and classed into predominant (>45% of pollen grains), secondary (1545% of pollen grains) and important minor (115% of pollen grains).
10: The location data for the honey samples were restricted to the county level, and summary data tables were presented for each UK county that returned honey.
