0: Illumina MiSeq paired-end indexed amplicon libraries were created via a two-step PCR protocol.
1: Two libraries were prepared for the DNA barcode regions,  rbcL and ITS2.
2: Initial amplification used the template specific primers  rbcLaf and  rbcLr506 37, and ITS2F and ITS3R, with universal tails designed to attach custom indices in the second-round PCR.
3: To improve clustering on the Illumina MiSeq, a 6N sequence was also added between the forward template specific primer and the universal tail.
