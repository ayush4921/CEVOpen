0: This first PCR used a final volume of 20 l: 2 l template DNA, 10 l of 2 Phusion Hot Start II High-Fidelity Mastermix (New England Biolabs UK), 0.4 l (2.5 M) forward and reverse primers, and 7.2 l of PCR grade water.
1: Thermal cycling conditions for  rbcL were: 98 C for 30 s, 95 C for 2 min; 95 C for 30 s, 50 C for 30 s, 72 C for 40 s (40 cycles); 72 C for 5 min, 30 C for 10 s. Thermal cycling conditions for the first ITS2 PCR were: 98 C for 30 s 94 C for 5 min; 94 C for 30 s, 56 C for 30 s, 72 C for 40 s (40 cycles); 72 C for 10 min, 30 C for 1 min.
2: The initial PCR was carried out three times and pooled.
