0: This index PCR stage used a final volume of 25 l reaction (12.5 l of 2 Phusion Hot Start II High-Fidelity Mastermix, 1 l of i7 Index Primer and i5 Index Primer, 6.5 l of PCR grade water, and 5 l of purified first-round PCR product).
1: Thermal cycling conditions were: 98 C for 30 s; 95 C for 30 s, 55 C for 30 s, 72 C for 30 s (8 cycles); 72 C for 5 min, 4 C for 10 min.
2: Following the index PCR, a 1% gel was run to verify its success.
3: The index PCR product was then purified following the PCR clean-up two sections of the Illumina protocol.
4: The purified products of the index PCR were quantified using a Qubit 3.0 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and pooled at equal concentrations to produce the final library.
5: Positive and negative controls were amplified and sequenced alongside honey samples.
6: The positive control was made from a mixture of five tropical tree species that were not present in the survey site.
7: The species  Baccaurea stipulata,  Colona serratifolia.,  Dillenia excelsa,  Kleinhovia hospita, and  Pterospermum macrocarpum were used, taking 5 l from each separate DNA extraction and mixing, before following the protocol as with the honey samples.
8: All five species were detected within the sequencing results.
