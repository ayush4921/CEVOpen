0: Widespread declines in insect pollinators and the associated impacts on crops and biodiversity is a global problem 1  3.
1: One of the major factors implicated in pollinator declines is the reduction of floral resources due to agricultural intensification and habitat loss 4  7.
2: Across Europe, the dominant land use is agriculture, with over half of the European landscape being managed agriculturally 8.
3: Agricultural land is therefore a focus of conservation efforts to prevent the loss of associated biodiversity 8,  9.
4: The input of inorganic nitrogen, re-seeding of grassland leys, high levels of grazing, and herbicide application can all cause species-rich, semi-natural grassland to become improved grassland, with a corresponding reduction in the diversity and availability of flowers used by pollinating insects for nectar and pollen 10.
5: In England and Wales, the proportion of lowland semi-natural grassland has been estimated to be 3% of what was present prior to 1939 11.
