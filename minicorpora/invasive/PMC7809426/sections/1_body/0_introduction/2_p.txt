0: It is possible to track changes in the availability of nectar resources over time by combining vegetation surveys and direct nectar measurements 12, but it is difficult to relate this to changes in pollinator foraging.
1: Honeybees are an ideal model to assess landscape changes in forage availability and usage as they have a widespread distribution and long foraging range 13.
2: Managed honeybees can be geolocated exactly and so by characterising the pollen found within honey, we can determine the floral resources used for nectar and pollen in the area surrounding the hive 14.
