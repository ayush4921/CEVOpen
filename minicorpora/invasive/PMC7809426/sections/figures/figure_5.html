 <caption> Change (%) in plant taxa used by honeybees from 1952 to 2017 along with changes in the abundance of those taxa in the Countryside Survey (%). The taxa included are those found as predominant and secondary within honey samples (&gt;15% of pollen grains in mellisopalynology or &gt;15% of DNA sequences) for more than 1% of samples in both surveys. The p-value for the chi-squared tests used Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. The Countryside Survey represents changes in the abundance of the taxa within 1577 fixed plots between 1978 and 2007. </caption>
