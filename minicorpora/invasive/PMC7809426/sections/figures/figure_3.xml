  <title>The most abundantly found plant taxa in the honey samples analysed using DNA metabarcoding are summarised as a proportion of samples through the season.</title>
  <p>Plant taxa illustrated are the most frequently found plant taxa in 2017 at a predominant and secondary level. Samples collected in April (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3) and October (
   <italic>n</italic> = 7) were excluded. Sample sizes: May (
   <italic>n</italic> = 39), June (
   <italic>n</italic> = 71), July (
   <italic>n</italic> = 147), August (
   <italic>n</italic> = 155), September (
   <italic>n</italic> = 43). Predominant: &gt;45% of sequences returned in a sample, secondary: 15–45%, important minor: 1–15% and minor &lt;1%. The overall height of the bar indicates the total proportion of samples with that taxon.
