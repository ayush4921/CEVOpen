Understanding which plants pollinators use is vital to inform the provision of appropriate floral resources to help prevent pollinator loss. Using a globally important pollinator, the honeybee, we show how changes in agricultural intensification, crop use and the spread of invasive species, have altered the nectar and pollen sources available in the UK. Using DNA metabarcoding, we analysed 441 honey samples from 2017 and compared these to a nationwide survey of honey samples from 1952. We reveal that shifts in major plants foraged by honeybees are driven by changes in the availability of these plants within the landscape. Improved grasslands are the most widespread habitat type in the UK, and management changes within this habitat have the greatest potential to increase floral resource availability.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Laura Jones et al. compare honey samples across the UK from 2017 to a nationwide survey of honey samples from 1952 in order to determine how nectar and pollen sources have changed over time.

One of the major factors implicated in pollinator declines is the reduction of floral resources due to agricultural intensification and habitat loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Across Europe, the dominant land use is agriculture, with over half of the European landscape being managed agriculturally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Agricultural land is therefore a focus of conservation efforts to prevent the loss of associated biodiversity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The input of inorganic nitrogen, re-seeding of grassland leys, high levels of grazing, and herbicide application can all cause species-rich, semi-natural grassland to become improved grassland, with a corresponding reduction in the diversity and availability of flowers used by pollinating insects for nectar and pollen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In England and Wales, the proportion of lowland semi-natural grassland has been estimated to be 3% of what was present prior to 1939<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">It is possible to track changes in the availability of nectar resources over time by combining vegetation surveys and direct nectar measurements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, but it is difficult to relate this to changes in pollinator foraging. Honeybees are an ideal model to assess landscape changes in forage availability and usage as they have a widespread distribution and long foraging range<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Managed honeybees can be geolocated exactly and so by characterising the pollen found within honey, we can determine the floral resources used for nectar and pollen in the area surrounding the hive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Here, honey provided by beekeepers as part of a nationwide UK campaign in 2017 has been characterised and compared to honey sampled in 1952, enabling us to investigate whether landscape-scale changes in the floral resource are leading to changes in honeybee foraging. DNA metabarcoding, using two complementary DNA barcode markers (<italic>rbcL</italic> and ITS2), was used to identify the plant taxa within contemporary honey samples, extracted from hives between April and October, across the latitudinal and longitudinal range of the UK in 2017. We compared the plant composition of the 2017 honey with the last UK wide survey of honey samples from 1952, characterised using melissopalynology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. DNA metabarcoding leverages a higher taxonomic resolution of the plant taxa present in the honey when compared to microscopic identification and so a conservative approach was taken to compare the data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par6">In 2017, we analysed 441 honey samples, with most samples provided from England and Wales in July (147 samples) and August (155 samples) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

The number of times each taxon occurred at each level of abundance was then calculated, with the sum of this giving the frequency of occurrence across all the samples.</p><p id="Par46">The results of the 2017 analysis were then compared with 855 honey samples characterised in 1952, from across the UK and Ireland using melissopalynology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The relationship between the frequency of occurrence for the matched plant taxa between 1952 and 2017 was assessed using Kendall&#x02019;s rank correlation.</p><p id="Par47">To compare the major taxa (classed as predominant and secondary) between 2017 and 1952, the effect of sample location (UK county name) and sample year (2017 or 1952) were included in a two-tailed generalized linear model using the &#x02018;manyglm&#x02019; function in the package &#x02018;mvabund&#x02019;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. In the absence of latitude and longitude for honey samples collected in 1952, UK ceremonial county names were used as a proxy for the location for both 2017 and 1952 honey samples. Honey samples from 2017 were assigned their ceremonial county based on latitude and longitude and matched to the counties listed in 1952. Using a binomial distribution, the effect of county location and year (1952 and 2017) were included as explanatory variables in the model and the presence or absence of each taxa was set as the response variable. The appropriateness of the models was checked by visual inspection of the residuals against predicted values from the models (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">11</xref>).</p><p id="Par48">The change in proportion of major (predominant and secondary) taxa between 1952 and 2017 was examined for the plant taxa that occurred as major taxa in more than 1% of samples for both honey surveys. Chi-squared contingency tests were used to assess differences, with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing.

In 1978, the survey looked at 256 1&#x02009;km squares within which fixed plots were established, representing fields and unenclosed land (200&#x02009;m<sup>2</sup>) as well as linear features including hedgerows, streams and roadsides (10&#x02009;m<sup>2</sup>). In each plot, a list of all vascular plants was recorded. Where possible, squares and plots were then revisited in 2007, representing 236 1&#x02009;km squares containing 1577 plots.

A chi-squared contingency test was used to analyse the differences between the presence of the crop species in the honey and the presence and absence of the crop within the landscape. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination was used to visualise differences in the composition of the honey relating to the dominant habitat type in a 2&#x02009;km radius, based on the proportion of reads returned for each taxon. Ordinations were carried out using the metaMDS function in the vegan package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup> in R using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity indices. The differences in plant community composition and surrounding dominant habitat type were tested using the <italic>adonis</italic> function from vegan, with 999 permutations.
