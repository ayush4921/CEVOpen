<p>Author should explain how this root extract added to the soil can mimic what R. typhina is really releasing in the soil during its growth. In fact, the extract contains the molecules that water could extract from the whole root, but there is no proof that those molecules are the ones that R. typhina roots exudate in the soil. In the introduction, authors cite the “novel weapon hypothesis” and say that “Our results support the ‘novel weapons hypothesis’”. The cited hypothesis is proposed by Callaway and Ridenour (2004) who say “that some exotics transform from native weaklings to invasive bullies by exuding biochemicals that are highly inhibitory (allelopathic) to plants or soil microbes in invaded communities”. The hypothesis is based on molecules released as exudates. Also, the cited works in the discussion are about root exudates, rhizospheric soil, leaf leachates. Authors describe the effects on T. erecta growth and on soil bacteria, but those effect are due to molecules extracted from roots non exudated by roots. There is a big difference between root exudates and root extract.</p>
