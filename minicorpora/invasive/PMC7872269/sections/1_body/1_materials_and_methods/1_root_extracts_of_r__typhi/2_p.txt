0: 1000 g of roots were taken from the plants of  R.  typhina and washed, air dried for 48 h and then powdered in a grinder until 98% of the powder could pass through 10 mm mesh sieve.
1: The samples were extracted with deionized water, shaken at 50 rpm -1 for 48 h, then concentrated by rotary evaporation, and finally dried in a freeze dryer.
2: The obtained substance was 24.96 g, and the extraction rate was 2.5%.
3: The concentration of the extract solution was set to 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10 mgmL -1 according to previous experimental data, then kept in brown bottles at 4C for subsequent processing [ 22].
