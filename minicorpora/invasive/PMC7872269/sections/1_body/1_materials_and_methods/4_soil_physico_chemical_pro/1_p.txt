0: We measured the following soil properties: pH, electrical conductivity (EC), water content (SWC), soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN).
1: The soil pH and EC of the samples were measured using a digital pH-meter (CP-401, ELMETRON) and electric conductivity meter (DDSJ-308A); SWC was measured by the oven-drying method; SOC was measured using a Mebius method by the Walkley-Black acid digestion; TN was determined with an autoanalyzer (Foss 2100, FOSS Kjeltec) using the Kjeldahl method following vitriol digestion.
