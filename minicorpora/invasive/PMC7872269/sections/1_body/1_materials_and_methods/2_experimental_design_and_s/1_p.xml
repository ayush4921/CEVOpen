<p>Seeds of 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>erecta</italic> were collected on the campus of Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun, China in October 2016. The selected seeds were soaked and disinfected with 0.3% KMnO
 <sub>4</sub> solution for 5 min, then rinsed with distilled water 3–5 times. We initially sowed ten seeds of 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>erecta</italic> per pot (18 cm diameter×21 cm height) in a climate-controlled incubator at 25°C with diurnal lighting (light intensity was set at 2200 Lux on a 14:10 h light–dark cycle). After germination, we kept five plants in each pot. We use a mix of garden soil, turfy soil and perlite by volume 6: 3: 1. Pots were randomly assigned to treatments (i.e., control, 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10 mg·mL
 <sup>-1</sup> of root extracts). Pots were watered with 20 mL of different concentrations of root extracts every day, or 20 mL of distilled water for the control groups. Each treatment was replicated three times, for a total of 
 <italic>n</italic> = 15 pots and 
 <italic>n</italic> = 75 plants.
