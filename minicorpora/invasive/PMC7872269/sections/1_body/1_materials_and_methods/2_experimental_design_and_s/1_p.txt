0: Seeds of  T.  erecta were collected on the campus of Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun, China in October 2016.
1: The selected seeds were soaked and disinfected with 0.3% KMnO 4 solution for 5 min, then rinsed with distilled water 35 times.
2: We initially sowed ten seeds of  T.  erecta per pot (18 cm diameter21 cm height) in a climate-controlled incubator at 25C with diurnal lighting (light intensity was set at 2200 Lux on a 14:10 h lightdark cycle).
3: After germination, we kept five plants in each pot.
4: We use a mix of garden soil, turfy soil and perlite by volume 6: 3: 1.
5: Pots were randomly assigned to treatments (i.e., control, 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10 mgmL -1 of root extracts).
6: Pots were watered with 20 mL of different concentrations of root extracts every day, or 20 mL of distilled water for the control groups.
7: Each treatment was replicated three times, for a total of  n = 15 pots and  n = 75 plants.
