0: Average well color development (AWCD) was determined as follows: AWCD = (C 590 C 750)/31.
1: C 590 and C 750 are optical density value in 590 nm and 750 nm from each well, corrected subtracting the blank well (inoculated with distilled water) values from each plate well.
2: Diversity indices of AWCD were calculated as Shannon index ( H = -( Piln Pi)), Pielou evenness index ( E =  H/ Hmax =  H/ln S), and Simpson diversity index ( D = 1- Pi2).
3: Pi = C 590-C 750/(C590C 750),  S were calculated as the number of oxidized carbon substrates (Qu et al.
4: 2020).
