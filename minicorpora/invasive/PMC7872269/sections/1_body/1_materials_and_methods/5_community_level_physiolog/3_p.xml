<p>According to the change curve of carbon source utilization over time, incubation at 180 h was used to calculate AWCD, 
 <italic>H</italic>, 
 <italic>E</italic> and 
 <italic>D</italic> since it was the highest average well color development (AWCD) that was most consistent between treatments. The categorized carbon substrates were grouped into six guildsâ€“carbohydrates, amino acids, carboxylic acids, polymer, phenolic acids and amine.
