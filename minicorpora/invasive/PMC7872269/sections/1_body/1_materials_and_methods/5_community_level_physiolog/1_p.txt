0: Community-level physiological profiles (CLPP) is a good method used for measured microbial activity of rhizosphere soil, which were measured with Biolog Eco-plates TM (Biolog Inc., Hayward, CA, USA), which contains 31 types of carbon sources and one substrate-free control.
1: Soil samples (10 g d.w.) were firstly shaken (5 min, 180 rmin -1) after dilution with 90 mL of distilled sterile water (pH 7) for 20 min at 20C.
2: Then aliquot (150 L) were inoculated into wells of 96 Biolog Eco-plates and incubated at 25C.
3: The rate of utilization was showed by the reduction of the tetrazolium, a redox indicator dye that changes from colorless into purple.
4: Lastly, substrate utilization was monitored by measuring light absorbance at 590 and 750 nm.
5: The first measurement was made immediately after inoculation, and the subsequent ones were read every 12 h for a total of 240 h. The readings for individual substrates were corrected for background absorbance by subtracting the absorbance of the control (water) well and one of the absorbance of the first reading.
