<p>The experiment has been repeated three times. Differences in plant growth, soil physico-chemical properties and microbial activity between the different concentration extracts were tested by one-way ANOVA. Tukeyâ€™s tests were conducted separately to for post hoc analysis of differences between specific factor levels. Redundancy analysis (RDA) was conducted to link the use of particular carbon substrates to soil properties and to compare CLPPs. Monte Carlo permutations (MCP) with 999 permutation were used to test the significance of different factors along the first axis.</p>
