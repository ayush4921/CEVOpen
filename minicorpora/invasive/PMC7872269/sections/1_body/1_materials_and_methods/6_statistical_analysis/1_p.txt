0: The experiment has been repeated three times.
1: Differences in plant growth, soil physico-chemical properties and microbial activity between the different concentration extracts were tested by one-way ANOVA.
2: Tukeys tests were conducted separately to for post hoc analysis of differences between specific factor levels.
3: Redundancy analysis (RDA) was conducted to link the use of particular carbon substrates to soil properties and to compare CLPPs.
4: Monte Carlo permutations (MCP) with 999 permutation were used to test the significance of different factors along the first axis.
