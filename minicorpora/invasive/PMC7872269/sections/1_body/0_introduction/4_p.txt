0: Here, we examine the allelopathic effects of the invasive shrub  R.  typhina on the cultivated plant  T.  erecta via changes in soil conditions and microbial communities.
1: We compare soil properties, metabolic activity and microbial carbon utilization at increasing concentration of  R.  typhina root extracts and examine the effects of changing soil conditions on  T.  erecta growth.
2: We hypothesize that 1)  R.  typhina root extracts inhibit plant growth; 2)  R.  typhina root extracts decrease soil conditions; 3) The reasons of inhibition are the extracts negatively impact soil conditions and rhizophere soil microbial carbon source utilization.
