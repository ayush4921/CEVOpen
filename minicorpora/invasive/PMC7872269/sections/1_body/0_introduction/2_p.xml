<p>It is important to notice that aboveground and belowground systems are not closed and isolated compartment, but they are rather linked together, exchanging energy and materials. Soil microbes play a crucial role in soil nutrient cycling and soil health [

 <xref rid="pone.0246685.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the effects of root allelochemicals from invasive plants on the soil physical and chemical properties and soil microorganisms in order to improve our understanding of plant invasion mechanisms. Yet, we have a limited knowledge of the relative contribution of direct and indirect allelopathic effects between invasive and other species.
