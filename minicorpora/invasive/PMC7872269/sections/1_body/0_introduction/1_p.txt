0: Invasive species degrade the environment, reduce biodiversity and alter ecosystem processes, threatening livelihoods worldwide [ 1].
1: The mechanisms underlying successful plant invasion is a long-standing topic which is debated in ecology [ 2 5].
2: The theory of novel weapon hypothesis (NWH) states that plant invasive success depends upon the ability to release novel phytochemicals into the invaded community [ 6,  7].
3: According to the NWH, invasive success depends on plant biochemical weapons, including allelopathic and antimicrobial root exudates, that directly inhibit native plant growth or mediate new plantsoil microbial interactions.
4: Today, allelopathic effects of invasive species on co-occurring native plants are widely recognized as the major factors responsible for successful invasion in plant communities [ 8].
5: Despite the large number of previous studies investigating the allelopathic potential of invasive plants [ 9,  10], it is unclear about the role soil properties and microbial community play in mediating the impact of invasive species on plants.
6: Addressing the effects of alien invasion on soil biota may improve our understanding of the key role soil organisms play in ecological systems, mediating biotic interactions.
