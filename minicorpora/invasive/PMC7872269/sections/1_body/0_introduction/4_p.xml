<p>Here, we examine the allelopathic effects of the invasive shrub 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>typhina</italic> on the cultivated plant 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>erecta</italic> via changes in soil conditions and microbial communities. We compare soil properties, metabolic activity and microbial carbon utilization at increasing concentration of 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>typhina</italic> root extracts and examine the effects of changing soil conditions on 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>erecta</italic> growth. We hypothesize that 1) 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>typhina</italic> root extracts inhibit plant growth; 2) 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>typhina</italic> root extracts decrease soil conditions; 3) The reasons of inhibition are the extracts negatively impact soil conditions and rhizophere soil microbial carbon source utilization.
