0: Rhus typhina L. (Anacardiaceae) is a perennial shrub that make clones through production of underground root buds and forms large, dome-shaped canopies of a single genet, with progressively younger ramets developing around the periphery [ 15].
1: As an invasive shrub in most areas of China,  R.  typhina is classified as one of the most destructive invading exotic species and poses a great threat to terrestrial ecosystems due to his great ability to adapt and reproduce fast and its resistance to eradication once is established [ 16 18].
2: Tagetes erecta L. (Compositae) is a widespread ornamental plant and is commonly known as  Marigold, native to Mexico [ 19].
3: It is found that there are patterns of negative effects grown in conjunction with garden trees where may co-occur with  R.  typhina, which could be allelopathic effects impacted by  R.  typhina.
4: Recent studies highlight that  R.  typhina impacts both native plant communities and  T.  erecta by inhibiting seed germination and seedling growth [ 20,  21].
5: These evidences the potential allelopathy of  R.  typhina and its broad impact on biodiversity and local environmental conditions.
6: At present, however, it remains unclear whether and how  R.  typhina impacts soil microorganisms through root extracts, in turn affecting plant growth.
