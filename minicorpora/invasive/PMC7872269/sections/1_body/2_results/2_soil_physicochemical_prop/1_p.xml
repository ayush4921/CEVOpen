<p>Root extracts significantly increased soil EC and pH, and significantly decreased SOC and TN (
 <xref rid="pone.0246685.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). No significant effect was found for SWC and C/N (
 <xref rid="pone.0246685.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Soil pH increased with extract concentration increasing, and the highest pH and EC were at concentration of 10 mg·mL
 <sup>-1</sup> and 5 mg·mL
 <sup>-1</sup> with changes of 11.5% and 50.6%, respectively (

 <sup>-1</sup> concentration, with average change of 25.4% and 22.6%, respectively (
