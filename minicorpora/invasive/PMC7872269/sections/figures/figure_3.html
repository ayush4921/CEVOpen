 <caption> Substrate utilization patterns of different carbon source by soil microbial community after 180 h of incubation in the Biolog Eco-plates at different R. typhina root extract concentrations. Values represent means Â± standard deviation ( n = 15). Significant differences between carbon sources utilization are indicated with capital letters (A-C; P &lt; 0.05); significant differences between treatments of concentration are indicated with lowercase letters (a-c; P &lt; 0.05). </caption>
