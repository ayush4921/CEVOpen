0: Our expert elicitation did not involve human subjects, but rather expert contributors (the co-authors).
1: Thus, ethics committee approval was not sought as is common-practice for similar Delphi exercises.
2: Contributors were informed and agreed with the intent to publish at the outset, the nature of the structured expert elicitation process and were aware that they could withdraw at any time.
3: This information was communicated, and informed consent achieved, via email.
