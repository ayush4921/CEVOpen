0: Producing the 80 questions involved a four-phase process of structured expert elicitation.
1: Fig 1 provides an overview of the approach.
2: Phase 1 involved using an expert panel to identify and contact a group of 59 experts from a range of relevant disciplines.
3: 41 agreed to join the process.
4: In phase 2 these participants were asked to draw on their networks to propose tractable, unanswered research questions.
5: This resulted in a list of 450 collated questions split into 6 categories.
6: Phase 3 centreeed on anonymous voting by a subset of 32 participants who selected the top 10% of each category.
7: The voting results were used to inform discussion during a one-day workshop on 17 July 2019 at the University of Cambridge.
8: A subset of 35 participants attended the workshop and through a process of deliberation, voting and ranking, refined the questions and selected the top 80.
