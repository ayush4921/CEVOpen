<p>Producing the 80 questions involved a four-phase process of structured expert elicitation. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0241190.g001">Fig 1</xref> provides an overview of the approach. Phase 1 involved using an expert panel to identify and contact a group of 59 experts from a range of relevant disciplines. 41 agreed to join the process. In phase 2 these participants were asked to draw on their networks to propose tractable, unanswered research questions. This resulted in a list of 450 collated questions split into 6 categories. Phase 3 centreeed on anonymous voting by a subset of 32 participants who selected the top 10% of each category. The voting results were used to inform discussion during a one-day workshop on 17 July 2019 at the University of Cambridge. A subset of 35 participants attended the workshop and through a process of deliberation, voting and ranking, refined the questions and selected the top 80.
