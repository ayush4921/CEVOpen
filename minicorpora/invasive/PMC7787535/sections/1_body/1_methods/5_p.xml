<p>The questions were collated in the six categories with overlapping questions merged, resulting in an initial set of 450 questions (provided in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0241190.s002">S2 Appendix</xref>). This intial list is contained in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0241190.s002">S2 Appendix</xref>. The participants consulted an additional 168 experts in formulating these questions. The panel did not actively screen who the participants consulted. Instead this was left to participant discretion by asking them to draw on networks and colleagues that they considered relevant to the exercise. 60 of these wider experts provided direct questions that were part of the initial list of 450. The rest provided advice and comments more broadly, including on voting, and areas to examine or avoid. The categories were loosely based on the topics used by the selection panel to identify participants, with adjustments to suit the range and number of questions. The aim of the categorisation was to provide a logical method to coalesce questions into roughly equal groups for experts to focus on. Naturally, there are significant areas of overlap and connection, and many questions cut across multiple groupings. (The categories were revised for the final list of questions to better reflect the composition of selected questions. This categorisation was agreed to by consensus of participants during the process of drafting).
