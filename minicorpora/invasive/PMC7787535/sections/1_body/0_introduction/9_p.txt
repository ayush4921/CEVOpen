0: We used a broad definition of the term biological security in the development of these research questions, in line with the definition outlined in the  UK Biological Security Strategy.
1: That is, the protection of population and economic interests from naturally arising, accidentally occurring or deliberately caused biological risks (particularly significant disease outbreaks).
2: This covers biological risks affecting people, the economy and the environmentwhether these arise naturally, from deliberate actions, from unintended release or from the unanticipated consequences of deliberate release [ 5].
3: It is worth noting that biological security has more specific meanings within several of the disciplines and sectors represented by the workshop participants.
