 <italic>The Strategy</italic> is broad and does not identify what research needs to be done to ensure each pillar is met. Nor does it specify the research needed to ensure actions are robust to future developments in biosecurity. Indeed, t the best of our knowledge no such list of priority, tractable and unanswered rearch questions exist. We seek to remedy this by providing a targeted research agenda which meets both of these needs. To identify the most pressing questions for UK biological security, we used structured expert elicitation to generate a set of research questions of relevance to policy makers and UK biological security. When paried with the objectives and framework of the
