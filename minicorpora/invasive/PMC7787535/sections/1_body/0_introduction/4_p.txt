1: One of the key themes of the  UK Biological Security Strategy is a strong science base, and it highlights that all actions in biosecurity must be underpinned by high quality science and evidence if it is to be effective [ 5].
2: This need for evidence-based policy has been acknowledged [ 8].
3: Despite this, many biological security topics are neglected and there is a risk that policy-makers will not use evidence to inform decisions, due to lack of awareness or evidence complacency [ 9].
4: Furthermore, researchers may fail to effectively communicate the nuances of policy-relevant topics.
