<p>Our study provides consistent observational and experimental evidence for the importance of mycorrhizal type in the survival and growth of woody species in an afforestation system. Trees with distinct mycorrhizal associations give rise to soil microbial communities that differ in PSFs, which mediate their coexistence or exclusion. The results suggest that the strength and direction of PSFs of focal target tree species depend on mycorrhizal type. We illustrate how the compatibility among mycorrhizal types drive woody species coexistence through PSFs in mixed 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> plantations with native tree species. This is conductive to improve the silvicultural management of mixed-species forest plantations. Future studies will need to include more species for each mycorrhizal type and more systems may provide mechanistic insights into the species coexistence of woody species, which is important for making informed decisions on the selection of intercropped tree species for a better design for mixed-species forest plantations.
