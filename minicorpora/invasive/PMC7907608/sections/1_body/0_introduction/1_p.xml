<p>Increasing demand for timber products has led to the worldwide expansion of plantations of fast-growing tree species. However, these plantations are usually established in monoculture and are dominated by a few genera, such as 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic>, 
 <italic>Pinus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Acacia</italic>, in tropical and subtropical regions. This has led to a series of ecological problems, such as soil degradation and erosion, loss of local plant diversity, and decrease in ecosystem functions (
