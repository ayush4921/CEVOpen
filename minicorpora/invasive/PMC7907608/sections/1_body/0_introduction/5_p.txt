0: Eucalyptus, indigenous to Australia and Indonesia, is the most common afforestation or reforestation genus in the world ( Forrester, 2013).
1: China has the second largest area of  Eucalyptus plantations, which covered 4.5 million hectares by the end of 2014 ( Chinese Society of Forestry, 2016).
2: However,  Eucalyptus plantations strongly alter the native plant community structure and function ( Gaertner et al., 2011) and produce unfavorable soil conditions for subsequent plant species ( Tererai et al., 2013;  Wu et al., 2013).
3: Many studies have suggested that mixing fast-growing leguminous tree species (e.g.,  Acacia) with  Eucalyptus is a good silvicultural practice that increases plant diversity and soil nutrients ( Forrester et al., 2006;  Santos et al., 2017;  Voigtlaender et al., 2019).
4: However, we found that legume-rhizobium symbiosis is susceptible to allelopathic inhibition caused by  Eucalyptus allelochemicals ( Liu et al., 2019), resulting in worse survival of leguminous plants beneath  Eucalyptus plantations than other mycorrhizal tree species ( Qin et al., 2018).
5: Moreover, exotic fast-growing species is also a threat of biological invasion.
6: Thus, it is vital to screen compatible species that can coexist with  Eucalyptus for a better design of mixed  Eucalyptus plantations ( Tesfaye et al., 2015;  Sun et al., 2017).
