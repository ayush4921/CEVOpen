<p>Mycorrhizal associations with plant roots are important drivers of positive PSF (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">van der Putten et al., 2013</xref>). Currently, the positive feedback mediated by mycorrhizal fungi tends to result in local dominance through promotion of their host performance (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Peh et al., 2011</xref>). Mycorrhizal fungi provide host plants with soil nutrients and antagonists protection in exchange for photosynthates. There is also a host preference in mycorrhizal symbiosis ranging from facultative to obligate (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Smith and Smith, 2015</xref>), due to preferential allocation of photosynthates to more efficient mycorrhizal fungi partner by host plants (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Bever, 2015</xref>). Moreover, the benefits derived from mycorrhiza may be contingent upon mycorrhizal type and may lead to species-specific PSF promoting species coexistence (
