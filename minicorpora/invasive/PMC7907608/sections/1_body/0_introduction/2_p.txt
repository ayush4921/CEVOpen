0: Plant-soil feedback (PSF) plays an important role in terrestrial plant coexistence, diversity and community succession ( Mangan et al., 2010;  van der Putten et al., 2016;  Pizano et al., 2019).
1: PSF refers to plant-induced species-specific changes in soil biotic and abiotic conditions, which in turn impact the growth and recruitment of subsequent plants ( van der Putten et al., 2013).
2: Focal species may be negatively affected by reduced nutrient availability and the accumulation of pathogens and allelochemicals, whereas they may be positively affected by the promotion of symbionts and/or nutrient availability ( Bennett and Klironomos, 2019;  Wang et al., 2019).
3: The relative strength and direction of PSFs can depend on the results of positive vs. negative feedbacks, which have implications for the plant community assembly ( van der Putten et al., 2013;  Liang et al., 2015;  Chen et al., 2019).
