<p>Mycorrhizal type, through impact on soil microbial community, alter the interspecific competition and facilitation effects of co-existing plants. Mycorrhizal type that improves plant coexistence is usually linked to the complementary use of soil nutrient resources (
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Turner, 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Luo et al., 2018</xref>), such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). Mycorrhizal type of dominant tree species is a potential predictor of the biochemical process of soil nutrient dynamics by which selecting for specific microbial groups with distinct enzyme functions (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Cheeke et al., 2017</xref>). This will induce a negative PSF on plant growth and provide the dominant plants a competitive advantage over neighboring or subsequent plants. When limited to the same resources, the functional diversity of mycorrhizal types could relieve competitive pressure and enhance plant growth and survival. A recent study has showed that partitioning of soil P among different mycorrhizal trees contributed to species coexistence in subtropical natural forests (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, a growing body of literature indicates that the composition of aboveground plant communities can culture the belowground microbial community toward certain functional groups, such as species-specific pathogens (

 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Bever et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). Plant functional traits have also been suggested to affect adaptation to the local soil chemistry or soil microbial community (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Revillini et al., 2016</xref>). For example, ectomycorrhizal (EM) plants may represent more positive PSFs than arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) plants because EM plants have greater access to transfer N

 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Tedersoo et al., 2020</xref>) or greater protection from antagonists through the physical sheath that surrounds young feeder roots (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Bennett et al., 2017</xref>). The bacteria community in the mycorrhizosphere also has significant impact on spore germination or colonization of mycorrhizal fungi (
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">Xavier and Germida, 2003</xref>). Thus, the soil microbial community cultured by different mycorrhizal type of focal plants may lead to species-specific feedbacks, resulting in species coexistence or exclusion with subsequent plants.
