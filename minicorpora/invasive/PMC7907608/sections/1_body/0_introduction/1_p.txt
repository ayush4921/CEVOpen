0: Increasing demand for timber products has led to the worldwide expansion of plantations of fast-growing tree species.
1: However, these plantations are usually established in monoculture and are dominated by a few genera, such as  Eucalyptus,  Pinus, and  Acacia, in tropical and subtropical regions.
2: This has led to a series of ecological problems, such as soil degradation and erosion, loss of local plant diversity, and decrease in ecosystem functions ( Bauhus et al., 2017).
3: To resolve the dilemma, screening suitable plants is vital for a better design of mixed forest plantations that increase plant diversity and restore original ecosystem function and the degraded pure plantations ( Forrester et al., 2006;  Amazonas et al., 2018;  Yao et al., 2019).
4: However, the compatible combinations of intercropped species and the mechanism underlying species coexistence among different woody plants in afforestation ecosystems remain poorly understood.
