 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic>, indigenous to Australia and Indonesia, is the most common afforestation or reforestation genus in the world (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Forrester, 2013</xref>). China has the second largest area of 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> plantations, which covered 4.5 million hectares by the end of 2014 (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Chinese Society of Forestry, 2016</xref>). However, 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> plantations strongly alter the native plant community structure and function (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Gaertner et al., 2011</xref>) and produce unfavorable soil conditions for subsequent plant species (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Tererai et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). Many studies have suggested that mixing fast-growing leguminous tree species (e.g., 
 <italic>Acacia</italic>) with 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> is a good silvicultural practice that increases plant diversity and soil nutrients (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Forrester et al., 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Santos et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Voigtlaender et al., 2019</xref>). However, we found that legume-rhizobium symbiosis is susceptible to allelopathic inhibition caused by 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> allelochemicals (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2019</xref>), resulting in worse survival of leguminous plants beneath 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> plantations than other mycorrhizal tree species (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Qin et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, exotic fast-growing species is also a threat of biological invasion. Thus, it is vital to screen compatible species that can coexist with 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> for a better design of mixed 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> plantations (
