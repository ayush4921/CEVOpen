0: Mycorrhizal associations with plant roots are important drivers of positive PSF ( van der Putten et al., 2013).
1: Currently, the positive feedback mediated by mycorrhizal fungi tends to result in local dominance through promotion of their host performance ( Peh et al., 2011).
2: Mycorrhizal fungi provide host plants with soil nutrients and antagonists protection in exchange for photosynthates.
3: There is also a host preference in mycorrhizal symbiosis ranging from facultative to obligate ( Smith and Smith, 2015), due to preferential allocation of photosynthates to more efficient mycorrhizal fungi partner by host plants ( Bever, 2015).
4: Moreover, the benefits derived from mycorrhiza may be contingent upon mycorrhizal type and may lead to species-specific PSF promoting species coexistence ( Bennett et al., 2017).
