<p>The PSF strength in heterospecific soil inocula depended on mycorrhizal type of both focal plants and soil origins (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). NM plants had consistent conspecific negative PSFs (i.e., indicating species coexistence); by contrast, NF and EU plants had consistently conspecific positive PSFs indicating they would not coexist with heterospecific plants. PSFs of AM and EM plants were variable with soil inocula from different mycorrhizal types. EU plants had consistent conspecific positive PSFs and induced negative PSFs for mycorrhizal plants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Different soil inocula did not result in significant difference on seedling survival (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). There was a significant interaction between mycorrhizal type of focal plants and type of soil inocula on gainDW (
