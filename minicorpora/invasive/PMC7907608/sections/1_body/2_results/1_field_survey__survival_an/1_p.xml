<p>In the field, mycorrhizal type had a significant impact on survival and basal growth of focal tree species, either in the short term (18 months) or relative long term (114 months) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Mycorrhizal plants survived better than NF plants. NF plants (e.g., 
 <italic>L. leucocephala</italic> and 
 <italic>A. lebbeck</italic>) suffered the lowest survival rate with only an average of 15% after 10 a since planting (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). There was no significant difference between AM and EM tree species on seedling survival. NM species (i.e., 
 <italic>H. cochinchinensis</italic>) consistently had the highest survival rate compared with mycorrhizal and NF species (
