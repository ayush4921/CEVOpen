<p>Soil microbial community of 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> significantly altered biomass allocation (i.e., AbUn) of both AM and EM plants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), but not for seedling biomass and seedling height (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS1">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>). AM seedlings consistently had positive MGRs across different microbial compositions of 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> soil biota, increasing more to the aboveground biomass; whereas, EM seedlings had a negative MGR when inoculated with non-mycorrhizal soil fractions of 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> (
