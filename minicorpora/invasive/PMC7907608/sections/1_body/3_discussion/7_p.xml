<p>Plant functional traits are important predictors for PSFs and able to shape the plant community and ecosystem functioning (
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">Zirbel et al., 2017</xref>). The type of mycorrhizal association has been recently shown to determine the strength and direction of PSFs in several natural systems (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Bennett et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">Zirbel et al., 2017</xref>),whereas the actual mechanism is still unidentified. Our study emphasized the possible mycorrhizal-mediated PSFs on species coexistence in mixed-species 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> plantations. However, limited to the time of pot experiments, only PSFs of seedlings at the early stage of growth were detected in pot experiments. And the pattern of seedling growth is vital for community succession and development. Species-specific traits of native tree species were conducive to change the competitive and facilitative effects of 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> on their survival and growth (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2017</xref>). Although the seedling survival and biomass growth are two important comprehensive indicators for performance, more physiological and nutrient parameters should be helpful to illustrate the interspecific interactions. Our findings in this study imply that 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> is more likely to be a selection pressure on soil microbes in a species-specific manner and drive PSFs among different mycorrhizal types. Therefore, more sophisticated experiments with method of radioactive element tracer, microbiome and metabonomics and more tree species are needed in the future. It will provide more mechanistical sight into PSFs among different mycorrhizal type trees.
