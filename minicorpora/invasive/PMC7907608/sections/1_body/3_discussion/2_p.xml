<p>Plants locally adapted to specific soil nutrient availability and chemistry and soil microbial community conditioned by plants with similar functional and phylogenetic traits (

 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Keane and Crawley, 2002</xref>). Exotic invasive plants can accumulate pathogens (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Mangla and Callaway, 2008</xref>) or decrease mycorrhizal fungi (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Stinson et al., 2006</xref>), and provide them with a competitive advantage over native species. Some researchers have shown exotic 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> can also alter the composition of soil microbial communities at the early developmental stage in subtropical China (
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2013</xref>), resulting in changes in the local adaptation of native species to the soil community (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Lankau, 2013</xref>). In this study, we found that 
 <italic>E. urophylla</italic> cultured a very distinct soil microbial community with more unique microorganism species than other native species (

 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> seedlings were enhanced with its conspecific soil and had consistent conspecific positive feedbacks; however, there was no significant difference with the sterilized soil (

 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic>, as an exotic species, may not benefit from enemy release in our experimental region.
