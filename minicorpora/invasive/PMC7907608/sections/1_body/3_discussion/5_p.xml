<p>Mycorrhizal fungi, as an effective acquisition strategy for soil P, undergo significant community changes following conversion from secondary natural forest to exotic 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> plantations (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). The mycorrhizal fungal species abundance was significantly lower than that in the secondary forest soil and decreased with time after planting, and 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> plants had the lowest mycorrhizal inoculation rate over a relatively long-term period (∼10 a) (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Previous study has shown that adaptation among plants and locally adapted mycorrhiza’s and other root-associated fungi and rhizobacteria can help to predict the direction and outcome of PSFs (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Revillini et al., 2016</xref>). The host-specific growth of mycorrhizal fungi reduces plant benefits and leads to negative feedback, decreasing plant performance within a mutualistic relationship (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Bever, 2002</xref>). Hence, this degradation of exotic 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> plants may result from the incompatibility of mycorrhizal type for maladaptation to the local soil mycorrhizal community (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Levine et al., 2004</xref>), because of less positive effects on plant growth mediated by P nutrient acquisition.
