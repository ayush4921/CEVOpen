<p>Our observational and experimental results suggested that mycorrhizal-mediated PSF is able to drive species coexistence of tree species in 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> plantations. Our findings highlight the significant impact of compatibility between different mycorrhizal types on the survival and growth of tree species in mixed-species forest plantations. The strength and direction of PSFs depend on mycorrhizal types of focal species and soil inocula origins. 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> plants can induce unfavorable soil community resulting in conspecific positive PSFs on NF plants. NM plant would be a good candidate for established the multiple-species 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> plantations. Our findings reveal that compatibility between different mycorrhizal type plants may depend on the local adaptation to the specific soil microbial community cultured by distinct mycorrhizal plants.
