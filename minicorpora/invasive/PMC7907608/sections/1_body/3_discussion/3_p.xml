<p>It is noted that 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> has been identified as invasive in some introduced regions, such as South Africa and the southeastern United States. However, 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> is not invasive in China since it was introduced in 1890s. According to our observation, it is not uncommon to find fallen dead trees of 
 <italic>E. urophylla</italic> in the public welfare forest where our experimental plots are located. A recent study showed that PSF is a significant predictor of the success and even invasiveness of alien plants (

 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic>. Consistently, the decreased local dominance of exotic plant species with time did not correlate with more negative PSF caused by soil pathogens (
