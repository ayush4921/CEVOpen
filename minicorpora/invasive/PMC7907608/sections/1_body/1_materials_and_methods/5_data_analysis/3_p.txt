0: For the  PSF Experiment 2, we proposed the microbial growth response (MGR) to estimate effects of different microbial compositions in  Eucalyptus soil on seedling height, total biomass and ratio of above-/below-ground dry weight (AbUn).
1: The MGR referred to the net effect of soil biota (i.e., growth with versus without soil microbes) and was calculated using the following formula: MGR = log (growth in live soil/growth in sterilized soil).
2: Negative and positive MGR values, respectively, indicate the negative and positive effects of soil microbes on seedling growth.
