<p>We log10-transformed the PSFs and MGRs. To fits statistical assumptions (i.e., normality and homogeneity of variance for the data set), we conducted bootstrapping (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1,000) for the resulting mean and variance statistics of PSF and MGR. It was considered to be significantly positive or negative when their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the mean values did not overlap zero. Tukeyâ€™s HSD (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) was used for multiple comparisons. Statistical procedures were conducted in R for Windows 3.3.3 (
