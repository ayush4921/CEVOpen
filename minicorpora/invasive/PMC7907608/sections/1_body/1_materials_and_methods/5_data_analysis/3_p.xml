<p>For the 
 <italic>PSF Experiment 2</italic>, we proposed the microbial growth response (MGR) to estimate effects of different microbial compositions in 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> soil on seedling height, total biomass and ratio of above-/below-ground dry weight (AbUn). The MGR referred to the net effect of soil biota (i.e., growth with versus without soil microbes) and was calculated using the following formula: MGR = log (growth in live soil/growth in sterilized soil). Negative and positive MGR values, respectively, indicate the negative and positive effects of soil microbes on seedling growth.
