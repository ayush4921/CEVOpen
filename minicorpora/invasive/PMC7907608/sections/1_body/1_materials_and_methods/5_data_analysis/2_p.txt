0: For the  PSF Experiment 1, we detected how mycorrhizal type determines the strength and direction of PSFs.
1: PSF was calculated by comparing relative growth of seedling that in its conspecific soil inocula (Con) relative to that growth in heterospecific soil inocula (Heter) according to the mycorrhizal types: PSF = log (Con/Heter).
2: A negative feedback indicates the promotion of coexistence while positive feedback indicates monodominance.
3: The relative growth of each seedling by the change in dry weight, which was calculated as the final dry weight of surviving seedlings divided by its estimated initial dry weight.
4: The gain in dry weight for every seedling of each individual species was calculated as the harvested dry weight minus the estimated initial dry weight.
5: We conducted two-way ANOVA to determine the effects of mycorrhizal type (M), inoculum source (I) and their interaction (M  I) on the gain in dry weight (gainDW), height (gainH), number of leaves (gainNL), and SLA of target species.
6: For the soil fungal community in the species-specific soil of nine focal species, we constructed a Venn diagram to show shared or unique microbial species among them, using the Venn Diagram package in R 3.3.3.
