0: For the  Field survey, we conducted analysis of variance (ANOVA) to detect the effects of mycorrhizal type on plant survival and basal diameter growth of the four types tree species at 18, 36, 54, and 114 months since planting; we then compare their average survival rates between those four mycorrhizal types during the four planting periods, respectively.
1: We calculated the survival for each species in each plot.
2: The basal growth of each living individual was calculated as follows: (logDt  logD0)/t, where D0 was the initial basal diameter and Dt was the basal diameter measured at time t after planting.
