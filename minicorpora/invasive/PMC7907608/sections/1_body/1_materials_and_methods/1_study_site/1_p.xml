<p>Our field site is located in Shuilian Mountain Forest Park, Dongguan city, Guangdong Province, China (113°42′E, 22°58′N). The region has a subtropical monsoon climate. The mean annual precipitation is 1,780 mm, and the rainy season extends from April to September. The mean annual temperature is 23.2°C. Soils are latosols developed on granite with a pH of 3.8. The original vegetation was subtropical monsoon evergreen broad-leaved forest, including the families of Euphorbiaceae, Lauraceae, and Theaceae. However, the original vegetation had almost disappeared in 1990s as a result of the long-term human disturbance and severe soil erosion. The site was cleared of all vegetation (mainly shrubs and herbs) prior to reforestation of 
 <italic>Eucalyptus urophylla</italic> plantations in 1992. The 
 <italic>E. urophylla</italic> plantations covered about 200-ha and served as ecological welfare forests, and subsequently protected from any human disturbance after establishment. By the end of 2006, 
 <italic>E. urophylla</italic> trees entirely dominated the canopy and many dead adult 
 <italic>E. urophylla</italic> individuals were found in the plantations. Only a few native tree species were distributed sporadically in the plantations, such as 
 <italic>Diospyros morrisiana</italic>, 
 <italic>Rhus sylvestris</italic>, and 
 <italic>Aporosa chinensis</italic>. The understory was occupied by shrub species (e.g., 
 <italic>Psychotria rubra</italic>, 
 <italic>Ilex asprella</italic>) and herbaceous species (e.g., 
 <italic>Scleria levia</italic>, 
 <italic>Microstegium vagans</italic>). The pot experiments were conducted in the greenhouse at the School of Life Sciences building, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Center, Guangzhou city, with similar climate conditions to Shuilian Mountain Forest Park. The green-house had the sunlight and was at a day/night rhythm of temperatures of 28/22 °C in summer, and the air humidity was 75%.
