0: Our field site is located in Shuilian Mountain Forest Park, Dongguan city, Guangdong Province, China (11342E, 2258N).
1: The region has a subtropical monsoon climate.
2: The mean annual precipitation is 1,780 mm, and the rainy season extends from April to September.
3: The mean annual temperature is 23.2C.
4: Soils are latosols developed on granite with a pH of 3.8.
5: The original vegetation was subtropical monsoon evergreen broad-leaved forest, including the families of Euphorbiaceae, Lauraceae, and Theaceae.
6: However, the original vegetation had almost disappeared in 1990s as a result of the long-term human disturbance and severe soil erosion.
7: The site was cleared of all vegetation (mainly shrubs and herbs) prior to reforestation of  Eucalyptus urophylla plantations in 1992.
8: The  E. urophylla plantations covered about 200-ha and served as ecological welfare forests, and subsequently protected from any human disturbance after establishment.
9: By the end of 2006,  E. urophylla trees entirely dominated the canopy and many dead adult  E. urophylla individuals were found in the plantations.
10: Only a few native tree species were distributed sporadically in the plantations, such as  Diospyros morrisiana,  Rhus sylvestris, and  Aporosa chinensis.
11: The understory was occupied by shrub species (e.g.,  Psychotria rubra,  Ilex asprella) and herbaceous species (e.g.,  Scleria levia,  Microstegium vagans).
12: The pot experiments were conducted in the greenhouse at the School of Life Sciences building, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Center, Guangzhou city, with similar climate conditions to Shuilian Mountain Forest Park.
13: The green-house had the sunlight and was at a day/night rhythm of temperatures of 28/22 C in summer, and the air humidity was 75%.
