<p>To determine difference on soil microbes and soil nutrients of the nine focal tree species in 
 <italic>Experiment 1</italic>, we collected three species-specific soil samples for each focal species. Every soil sample was divided into two parts. One part of 5-g soil was used for analyzed the soil fungal community. The total genomic DNA was extracted from each sample by a standard protocol using CTAB (cetyl trimethylammonium bromide) (

The nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region (ITS rDNA gene) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the fungal primer set ITS1-1F (5′-CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA-3′) and ITS2 (5′-GCTGCGTTCTTCATCGATGC-3′). PCR products were mixed in equal density ratios and then purified with a Qiagen Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Germany). DNA samples were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2500 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, United States). The sequencing libraries were generated using a TruSeq DNA PCR-Free Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina, United States). Raw tags data were demultiplexed, quality-filtered and merged by FLASH (V1.2.7
