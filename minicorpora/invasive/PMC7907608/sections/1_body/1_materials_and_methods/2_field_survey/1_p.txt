0: To estimate the effects of mycorrhizal association type on survival and growth of tree species in  Eucalyptus plantations, we established a permanent plot at the field site during winter 2006 to spring 2007.
1: Initially, we collected seeds as many as 56 broad-leaved tree species.
2: Those seeds were placed in plastic basins with buck soil for germination and grew for 68 weeks before transplantation.
3: However, based on the quantity and quality of seedlings, we chose 20 broad-leaved tree species and transplanted them into the  E. urophylla plantations.
4: According to published data ( Wang and Qiu, 2006;  Brundrett, 2009;  Akmetzhanova et al., 2012) and results of our observations on their fine roots, we classified these 20 species into four root mycorrhizal types, namely, (i) AM, (ii) EM, (iii) nitrogen-fixing (NF), and (iv) non-mycorrhizal (NM) plants ( Supplementary Table 1).
5: We cleared all understory vegetations in the  E. urophylla plantations and set up six parallel transects (15 m  95 m for each) along the contours of the hillside.
6: Each transect included six plots (10 m  10 m) with 5 m-wide buffer zones between each plot, and 46 adult  E. urophylla trees were left in every plot.
7: We selected 10 tree species and transplanted them into a plot, at a density of 1 seedling/m 2 (i.e., 100 seedlings per plot).
8: In each transect, every three out of six plots was planted with the same 10 species while the other 10 species were planted into the rest of three plots ( Supplementary Figure 1).
9: Thus, there were 3,600 seedlings in total in this planting experiment (i.e., 6 transects  6 plots/transect  100 seedlings/plot).
10: We replaced wilted or dead seedlings during the first 30 days after planting.
11: We tagged all seedlings and first measured the basal diameter of each seedling in February 2007.
12: Thereafter, we recorded the survival status of each seedling for each tree species and remeasured their basal diameter every 3 months.
13: The last survey was conducted in June 2016.
