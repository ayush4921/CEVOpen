0: PSF Experiment 2: To evaluate the effects of different microbial compositions in soil cultured by  Eucalyptus, we used four AM plants ( Canarium album,  C. camphora,  Cryptocarya concinna, and  Hovenia dulcis) and four EM plants ( Castanopsis faberi,  Castanopsis fissa,  Cyclobalanopsis bambusaefolia, and  Cyclobalanopsis fleuryi) for focal plants.
1: We separately collected species-specific  Eucalyptus soil from three common  Eucalyptus species (i.e.,  E. urophylla,  Eucalyptus dunnii, and  E. urophylla   Eucalyptus grandis), at eight adult individuals per species.
2: To separate different compositions of the soil microbial community of  Eucalyptus, we mixed those  Eucalyptus soils and successively passed them through 250, 45, and 20-m sieves, using the wet-sieving method ( Klironomos, 2002).
3: The first soil suspension that passed through the 250-m sieve was treated as field soil (i), representing the composition and abundance of the whole soil microbial communities in  Eucalyptus soil; and then, we extracted the spores of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (mainly) for mycorrhizal soil fractions of mycorrhiza (ii), from the leftover remained on the 45-m sieve; the final suspension that passed through the 20-m sieve was used for non-mycorrhizal soil fractions of without mycorrhiza (iii).
4: We sterilized the suspension passed through 250-m sieves by gamma radiation (25 kGy) and treated it as a control for abiotic effects (vi).
5: We inoculated the newly germinated seedlings with those four microbial inocula ( Supplementary Figure 2B).
6: Thus, this experiment contained 512 pots in total, namely (8 species  4 soil inocula  16 replicates).
