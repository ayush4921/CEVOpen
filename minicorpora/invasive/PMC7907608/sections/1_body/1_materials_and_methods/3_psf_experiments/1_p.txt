0: We conducted two pot experiments using germinated seedlings to uncover the impact of mycorrhizal type on PSFs between  Eucalyptus and broad-leaved tree species.
1: We collected seeds of the focal native tree species during autumn and winter in 2016 from Heishiding Nature Reserve and Dinghushan Nature Reserve, Guangdong Province, China.
2: A. lebbeck is an introduced NF species that is used to improve soil fertility ( Forrester et al., 2006;  Hoogmoed et al., 2014).
3: Seeds of target species were surface sterilized (1 min 70% ethanol, 3 min 2.625% NaClO, 1 min 70% ethanol, and 1 min distilled water).
4: We dried the seed surface at room temperature and stored them at 4C until March 2017.
5: We sowed seeds into plastic boxes for germination in wet sterilized buck soils in the greenhouse.
6: Newly germinated seedlings (24 weeks) were chosen for transplantation as the experimental treatments.
7: E. urophylla is one of the most common afforestation tree species in southern China, and we obtained  E. urophylla seedlings from the China Eucalypt Research Centre, Zhanjiang city, Guangdong Province.
8: Before we transplanted the seedlings into the pots, we measured the fresh weight of each seedling.
9: In addition, for each species, we randomly selected 3040 seedlings and measured their fresh weight and dry weight (65C for 48 h).
10: We established the allometric growth relationships between fresh weight and dry weight to determine the initial dry weight of each planted seedling.
