<p>In the two PSF experiments, we first filled the pots with soil (i.e., sterilized background soil + soil inocula) until âˆ¼2 cm from the top of the pots. We then transplanted one seedling into a pot and added extra sterilized background soil (1 cm) to each pot to prevent air contamination. One week after seedling transplantation, we removed the seedlings that were dead or growing poorly and replaced them with new conspecific seedlings. We then measured the initial height and number of leaves of each seedling. Plants were watered twice a week using tap water and allowed to grow for 8 months. We randomly arranged the treatments within each block and exchanged the positions of each pot every month to decrease environmental heterogeneity. After measuring the final height and number of leaves of each living seedling, we harvested the plants and determined the dry weight of shoots and roots for every seedling. Three pieces of intact and mature leaves from each seedling were chosen and used to determine the specific leaf area (SLA) (
