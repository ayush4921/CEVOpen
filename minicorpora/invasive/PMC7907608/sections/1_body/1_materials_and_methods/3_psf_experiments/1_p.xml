<p>We conducted two pot experiments using germinated seedlings to uncover the impact of mycorrhizal type on PSFs between 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> and broad-leaved tree species. We collected seeds of the focal native tree species during autumn and winter in 2016 from Heishiding Nature Reserve and Dinghushan Nature Reserve, Guangdong Province, China. 
 <italic>A. lebbeck</italic> is an introduced NF species that is used to improve soil fertility (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Forrester et al., 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Hoogmoed et al., 2014</xref>). Seeds of target species were surface sterilized (1 min 70% ethanol, 3 min 2.625% NaClO, 1 min 70% ethanol, and 1 min distilled water). We dried the seed surface at room temperature and stored them at 4°C until March 2017. We sowed seeds into plastic boxes for germination in wet sterilized buck soils in the greenhouse. Newly germinated seedlings (2–4 weeks) were chosen for transplantation as the experimental treatments. 
 <italic>E. urophylla</italic> is one of the most common afforestation tree species in southern China, and we obtained 
 <italic>E. urophylla</italic> seedlings from the China Eucalypt Research Centre, Zhanjiang city, Guangdong Province. Before we transplanted the seedlings into the pots, we measured the fresh weight of each seedling. In addition, for each species, we randomly selected 30–40 seedlings and measured their fresh weight and dry weight (65°C for 48 h). We established the allometric growth relationships between fresh weight and dry weight to determine the initial dry weight of each planted seedling.
