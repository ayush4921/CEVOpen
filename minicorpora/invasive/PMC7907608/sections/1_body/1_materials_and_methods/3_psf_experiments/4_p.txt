0: In the two PSF experiments, we first filled the pots with soil (i.e., sterilized background soil + soil inocula) until 2 cm from the top of the pots.
1: We then transplanted one seedling into a pot and added extra sterilized background soil (1 cm) to each pot to prevent air contamination.
2: One week after seedling transplantation, we removed the seedlings that were dead or growing poorly and replaced them with new conspecific seedlings.
3: We then measured the initial height and number of leaves of each seedling.
4: Plants were watered twice a week using tap water and allowed to grow for 8 months.
5: We randomly arranged the treatments within each block and exchanged the positions of each pot every month to decrease environmental heterogeneity.
6: After measuring the final height and number of leaves of each living seedling, we harvested the plants and determined the dry weight of shoots and roots for every seedling.
7: Three pieces of intact and mature leaves from each seedling were chosen and used to determine the specific leaf area (SLA) ( Cornelissen et al., 2003).
