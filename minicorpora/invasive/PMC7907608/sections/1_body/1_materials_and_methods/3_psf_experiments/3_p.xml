<p>PSF Experiment 2: To evaluate the effects of different microbial compositions in soil cultured by 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic>, we used four AM plants (
 <italic>Canarium album</italic>, 
 <italic>C. camphora</italic>, 
 <italic>Cryptocarya concinna</italic>, and 
 <italic>Hovenia dulcis</italic>) and four EM plants (
 <italic>Castanopsis faberi</italic>, 
 <italic>Castanopsis fissa</italic>, 
 <italic>Cyclobalanopsis bambusaefolia</italic>, and 
 <italic>Cyclobalanopsis fleuryi</italic>) for focal plants. We separately collected species-specific 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> soil from three common 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> species (i.e., 
 <italic>E. urophylla</italic>, 
 <italic>Eucalyptus dunnii</italic>, and 
 <italic>E. urophylla</italic> × 
 <italic>Eucalyptus grandis</italic>), at eight adult individuals per species. To separate different compositions of the soil microbial community of 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic>, we mixed those 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> soils and successively passed them through 250, 45, and 20-μm sieves, using the wet-sieving method (

 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> soil; and then, we extracted the spores of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (mainly) for mycorrhizal soil fractions of mycorrhiza (ii), from the leftover remained on the 45-μm sieve; the final suspension that passed through the 20-μm sieve was used for non-mycorrhizal soil fractions of without mycorrhiza (iii). We sterilized the suspension passed through 250-μm sieves by gamma radiation (25 kGy) and treated it as a control for abiotic effects (vi). We inoculated the newly germinated seedlings with those four microbial inocula (
