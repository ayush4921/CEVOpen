 <caption> Plant-soil feedback (PSF) strength in relation to mycorrhizal types. Feedback strength is shown as log10 response ratios of the variation of plant biomass in conspecific (Con) with heterospecific (Heter) soils: PSFs = log10 (Con / Heter). Variation of plant biomass was calculated as the dry weight after harvested at the end of the experiment divided by the dry weight of the same seedling according to the allometric growth equation. The positive PSFs suggest species coexistence, while the negative PSFs suggest monodominance. Bootstrapping procedures ( n = 1,000) were conducted for the means and error bars of feedback strength values. The column in white is for the same mycorrhizal type, the gray is for other mycorrhizal types and the black column represents eucalypt plants. An asterisk indicated a statistically significant negative or positive feedback values if their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) do not include zero. AM, arbuscular mycorrhizal; EM, ectomycorrhizal; NF, nitrogen-fixing; NM, non-mycorrhizal; EU, eucalypt; All, overall soil biota effect size across all heterospecific soil. </caption>
