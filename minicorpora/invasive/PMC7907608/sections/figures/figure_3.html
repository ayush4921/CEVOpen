 <caption> Effects of different microbial compositions in soil fractions on ratio of aboveground vs. underground biomass of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and ectomycorrhizal (EM) plants. The microbial growth response (MGR) of seedlings was calculated as the log-response ratio comparing seedling growth between live soil fractions and sterilized soil fractions. M, NM, and FS were for mycorrhizal, non-mycorrhizal and field soil fractions respectively. All refers to overall soil biota effect size. MGR values above zero indicate positive effects of soil community on seedling growth, vice versa. An asterisk indicates a statistically significant negative or positive MGR value if their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) do not include zero. </caption>
