<p>The optimal fitting relationships between latitude and 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> abundance (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>1, 18</sub> = 4.817, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.042) and the total carbon content of the stem (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>1, 18</sub> = 5.124, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.036) were all linear equations, and with increasing latitude, these two traits showed significant increases (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">
  <bold>Figures 2A, B</bold>
 </xref>). Dissolved oxygen presented significant compound regression relationships with the height (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>1, 18</sub> = 5.078, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.037) and invasion cover (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>1, 18</sub> = 4.545, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.047) of 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic>, with both parameters decreasing with increasing dissolved oxygen levels (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">
  <bold>Figures 2C, D</bold>
 </xref>). The variation in 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> height along the conductivity gradient was unstable and was characterized by a cubic equation (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>2, 17</sub> = 5.114, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.011); however, 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> height overall increased with increasing conductivity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">
  <bold>Figure 2E</bold>
 </xref>). The optimal fitting relationships between the annual mean temperature and 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> abundance (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>2, 17</sub> = 3.637, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.048) and the total nitrogen content of the stem (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>1, 18</sub> = 5.455, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.031) were represented by quadratic and 
 <italic>S</italic> equations, respectively. Increasing temperature significantly decreased abundance and the stem nitrogen content (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">
  <bold>Figures 2F, G</bold>
 </xref>). Increased annual mean precipitation also significantly reduced the stem nitrogen content of 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic>, which was shown by the 
 <italic>S</italic> equation (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>1, 18</sub> = 4.874, 
 <italic>P</italic>Â = 0.040) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">
  <bold>Figure 2H</bold>
 </xref>). In addition, elevation and the nitrate nitrogen content of water had no significant effect on 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> performance, and all eight environmental factors had no significant effects on the C:N value of 
 <italic>E. crassipes.</italic>
