<p>For the relationship between the environmental factors and species diversity indices, the RDA ordination results showed that the cumulative percentage of variance in the diversity–environment relationships explained by the first two canonical axes reached 99.70% (90.70% for axis1 and 9.00% for axis2). Among these eight environmental factors, longitude was significantly positively related to axis1 (coefficient = 0.837, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and elevation was significantly negatively related to axis1 (coefficient = −0.612, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). Dissolved oxygen (coefficient = −0.606, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) and precipitation (coefficient = −0.573, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) were both significantly negatively related to axis2, while conductivity was significantly positively related to the axis2 (coefficient = 0.635, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) (

 <italic>E. crassipes</italic>-invaded community, as the loading on axis1 was much higher than that on axis2. Longitude was highly positively correlated with the four species diversity indices, particularly the Patrick richness index, while elevation was strongly negatively correlated with all of the diversity indices (
