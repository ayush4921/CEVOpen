<p>In this study, we identified the abiotic and biotic determinants of plant diversity associated with 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> invasion in southern China. We found that all four calculated Î±-species diversity indices significantly decreased with the increase in 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> importance value. Increasing latitude increased 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> abundance and the total carbon content of the stem. Increasing 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> height and species cover could reduce the dissolved oxygen, while increase in water conductivity increased 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> height. We also found that elevated temperature decreased 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> height and the total nitrogen content of the stem, and elevated precipitation also decreased stem nitrogen. The RDA results showed that the primary environmental determinants of plant diversity in the 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> community were longitude and elevation, while the biotic determinants associated with 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> traits were 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> cover, the leaf C:N ratio and abundance.
