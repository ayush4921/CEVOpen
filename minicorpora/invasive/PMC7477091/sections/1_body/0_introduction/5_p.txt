0: We hypothesize that heterogeneous environments may significantly affect the impacts of  E. crassipes on native plant diversity.
1: Specifically, we addressed the following two questions: (1) what are the coupling relationships between the growth and nutrient contents of  E. crassipes and the environment, and (2) which abiotic (environmental) and biotic (species-specific) factors determine aquatic plant diversity in invaded communities?
