<p>We hypothesize that heterogeneous environments may significantly affect the impacts of 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> on native plant diversity. Specifically, we addressed the following two questions: (1) what are the coupling relationships between the growth and nutrient contents of 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> and the environment, and (2) which abiotic (environmental) and biotic (species-specific) factors determine aquatic plant diversity in invaded communities?
