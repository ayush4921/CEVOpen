<p>In this study, we conducted field investigations on aquatic plant communities that were invaded by 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic> in southern China. We also measured the total carbon and nitrogen contents of 
 <italic>E. crassipes</italic>, and recorded environmental factors in every sampling plot, to examine the determinants of plant diversity in the 
 <italic>E. crassipes-</italic>invaded community.
