0: Water hyacinth,  E. crassipes, which is a free-floating aquatic macrophyte native to South America, has widely invaded freshwater systems in over 50 countries ( Villamagna and Murphy, 2010).
1: It has been listed as one of the most detrimental aquatic invasive plant species in southern China ( Ding et al., 2006;  Ding et al., 2008;  Bai et al., 2013).
2: E. crassipes often covers the water surface, obstructs rivers, decreases dissolved oxygen, reduces native aquatic plant diversity and even threatens human health by providing a refuge for mosquitoes ( Chandra et al., 2006;  Villamagna and Murphy, 2010;  Zhou et al., 2017).
3: Many recent studies on  E. crassipes have mainly focused on topics such as its biological control and clonal integration, water purification and the interactions of  E. crassipes with herbivores ( Bownes et al., 2013;  Pi et al., 2017;  Yu et al., 2019); however, how abiotic factors and the biotic determinants of plant diversity affect the impact of  E. crassipes is largely unknown.
4: Given that  E. crassipes shows superior abilities in terms of rapid growth, nutrient absorption, and environmental adaptation ( You et al., 2014) and climate change is ongoing ( e.g., warming and frequent floods), this invasive plant may expand its northern boundaries to higher latitudes and thus cause larger negative impacts on aquatic plant diversity in these regions ( Hoveka et al., 2016;  Liu et al., 2017;  Wu and Ding, 2019).
5: Therefore, understanding the biotic traits and ecological effects of  E. crassipes under global environmental changes is critical for accurately predicting its future invasion trends and conserving native biodiversity in aquatic ecosystems.
