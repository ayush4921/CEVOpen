0: Relative to terrestrial ecosystems, the fluid hydrological connectivity in aquatic ecosystems may accelerate nutrient cycling and transport, which would promote the growth of aquatic invasive plants by providing more suitable environments in which they may spread, particularly for free-floating species such as  Eichhornia crassipes ( Gao et al., 2013;  Chappuis et al., 2014;  Anufriieva and Shadrin, 2018;  Wu and Ding, 2019).
1: Because the species richness of aquatic floras is much lower than that of their terrestrial congeners, aquatic communities may be more vulnerable to alien plant invasions ( Santamaria, 2002;  Wu et al., 2017).
2: For example, invasion by  E. crassipes could significantly reduce native plant diversity in freshwater habitats by resource competitions, changing indigenous community structures and occupying vacant niches ( Villamagna and Murphy, 2010;  Lolis et al., 2020).
3: Furthermore, many aquatic invasive plants respond more dramatically to changes in the water environment than their native cooccurring congeners because as opportunistic species, they usually exhibit higher growth, reproduction, and competitiveness in destabilized aquatic ecosystems with resource fluctuations ( e.g., elevated temperature, precipitation, and nitrogen levels) ( Collinge et al., 2011;  Sorte et al., 2013;  You et al., 2014).
4: For instance, a high input of nitrate nitrogen (NO 3) to Cherry Lake in Australia significantly increased the total biomass accumulation and competitive ability of invasive  Phragmites australis over those of the accompanying native plants, causing it to largely displace the native species, leading to plant diversity loss in the aquatic ecosystems ( Uddin and Robinson, 2018).
5: Finally, both water quality parameters, such as dissolved oxygen and conductivity ( Rejmankova et al., 2018;  Pulzatto et al., 2019), and superior growth and/or physiological traits ( e.g., greater height, abundance, species cover, specific leaf area, nitrogen content, and ratio of carbon/nitrogen) ( Fan et al., 2013;  Lishawa et al., 2017;  Wu et al., 2017) also affect the performance of aquatic invasive plants and their ecological effects.
6: However, studies evaluating the impacts of invasive plants on native plant diversity on the basis of habitat conditions combined with invader properties are relatively rare (but see  Lembrechts et al., 2018).
