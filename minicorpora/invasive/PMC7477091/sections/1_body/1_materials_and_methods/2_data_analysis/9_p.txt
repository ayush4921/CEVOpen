0: We used regression analysis to examine the relationships between eight environmental factors (longitude, latitude, elevation, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, nitrate nitrogen, temperature, and precipitation) and the nine biotic traits of  E. crassipes (abundance, height, species cover, the total carbon content of the leaves, and stems, the total nitrogen content of the leaves and stems, and the C:N ratio of the leaves and stems).
1: We applied 11 regression models (linear, quadratic, compound, growth, logarithmic, cubic,  S, exponential, inverse, power, and logistic) provided in SPSS 16.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA).
2: Then, we selected the best-fitting models showing the maximum fitting coefficient ( R  2) and a significant  P value ( P< 0.05).
3: We used the same method to examine the relationship between the relative  IV of  E. crassipes and four species diversity indices.
