0: During July and August 2014, we conducted a field survey of invasive  E. crassipes in Hunan, Guangxi and Guangdong Provinces in southern China.
1: We selected ponds or rivers in which  E. crassipes covered an area of more than 100 m 2.
2: We set 20 plots (10 m  10 m, at least 10 km apart) spanning a latitudinal gradient from 21N to 28N (as shown in  Figure 1).
3: Three 10 m transects were evenly set up in each plot, and five quadrats (0.5 m  0.5 m) were uniformly spaced 2 m apart in each transect.
4: We used the measurement methods of  Wu et al.
5: (2017) to record the species name, height, coverage, and abundance of each plant species in every quadrat.
6: After the investigation of the plant community, we randomly collected the aboveground portions of eight  E. crassipes individuals from each plot and stored them separately in sealed plastic bags filled with silicone.
7: These plant samples were then brought back to the laboratory to measure the total carbon and total nitrogen contents of the leaves and stems of  E. crassipes by using a vario TOC cube analyzer (Elementar, Germany), and the stoichiometric C:N ratios (total carbon/total nitrogen) in the leaves and stems were calculated.
