  <p>NMDS of the understory vegetation layer in May and July 2009 and 2012 in open and fenced plots at 12 sites at West Point NY (
   <italic>N</italic> = 10 permanent monitoring quadrats per plot). Numbers indicate study sites. Black and red numbers indicate sampling year (2009 and 2012, respectively) and circled numbers represent fenced plots.
