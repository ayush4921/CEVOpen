<p>However, if we define recovery more specifically, for example as increased cover and diversity of a broad array of plant species typical of the forest understory and including deer-favoured and late successional species, then we must reject our first hypothesis. Culling or fencing alone, despite greatly reducing deer browse pressure, was unable to bring back preferred deer browse species to a point that their presence was detectable at the community monitoring levelâ€”not even over a decadal time period. Limited recovery of species highly favoured by deer occurred (Hypothesis 2) but was only detectable when monitoring individual species. And this recovery occurred only for species that remained present within the community. This is, in part, explained by the present-day infrequent occurrence, particularly of reproductive individuals, of these deer-favoured species over much of their range (
