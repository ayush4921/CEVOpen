<p>We expected that using typical plant community monitoring in 1 m
 <sup>2</sup> quadrats would allow us to capture (1) changes in plant community structure associated with reduced deer browse pressure, and (2) the recovery of species highly favoured by deer. Our data show that we can accept the first expectation (albeit the effect was very limited and we found it only at Fermilab for early successional species) but reject the second. At Fermilab, understory composition prior to the cull changed gradually, slightly differing year after year (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plx026-F3">Fig. 3</xref>), whereas after the cull vegetation composition did not differ among years, emphasizing the rapid dominance of a few early successional species, potentially suggesting a continued lagged or legacy response that was not remedied by a greatly reduced deer population. At West Point we did not capture a community response to fencing at any of the 12 sites (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plx026-F7">Fig. 7</xref>). At our sites monitoring at the community level was unable to capture the subtle positive effects of deer browse reduction on individual species, at least over the time frames used in our studies. Three of the four species that we monitored (

 <italic>P. pubescens</italic> and 
 <italic>T. recurvatum</italic>) require 2 years to emerge from seed, and 7–10 years to produce a first flower (

 <xref rid="plx026-B16" ref-type="bibr">Cullina 2000</xref>). To effectively capture a demographic success (initial colonization and a population increase) in these and similar slow-growing species, it may be necessary to monitor for a decade or longer using traditional permanent 1 m
 <sup>2</sup> quadrats.
