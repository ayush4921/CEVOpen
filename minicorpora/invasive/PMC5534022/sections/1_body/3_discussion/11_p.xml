<p>The differences in the height needed to initiate flowering between plants in open and fenced plots further suggests that chronic deer herbivory may over time favour plants with lower stature in areas where they are exposed to high deer herbivory. How these ecoâ€“evolutionary interactions play out over the long term, and how they could affect plant demography remains to be investigated. It is possible that decades of intensive deer browse may result in individuals of the remaining plant species that through phenotypic plasticity are reasonably well able to cope with deer browse but are poor performers or contributors to population growth rates due to reduced reproductive activity and stature. This may negatively affect the long-term viability of populations exposed to chronic deer herbivory.</p>
