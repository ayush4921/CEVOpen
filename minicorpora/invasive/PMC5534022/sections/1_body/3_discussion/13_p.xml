<p>Recognizing the limitations of approaches and metrics (such as plant community monitoring) to measure incremental long-term plant responses to changes in deer populations and deer browse pressure is an important part of management of forest understory communities. This includes the recognition that forest recovery needs to be appropriately defined and “simple” suggestions such as “increased diversity” or “increased native cover” as an outcome of deer management may be insufficient to safeguard or recover browse sensitive species that have dramatically declined over the past decades. Defining recovery through growth, ability to reproduce and positive population growth rates for individual species may be much more appropriate.</p>
