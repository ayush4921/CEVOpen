<p>There are strong legacy effects of long-term high deer abundance and non-native earthworm abundance (
 <xref rid="plx026-B20" ref-type="bibr">Dávalos 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2015c
 </xref>) that impact recovery of vegetation and community composition even after deer reduction. Under continuous intense browsing, forest understory vegetation can be nearly eliminated, leaving an empty forest floor (
 <xref rid="plx026-B32" ref-type="bibr">Goetsch 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2011
 </xref>). Once highly favoured and/or uncommon species are eliminated or greatly reduced, the trajectory of community recovery after deer reduction will shift, and the resultant community may have low similarity to the previous community. Deer legacy effects include altered tree recruitment with resulting ripple effects on invertebrate and bird communities (
 <xref rid="plx026-B62" ref-type="bibr">Nuttle 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2011
 </xref>), and altered herbaceous forest layer that does not have a height refuge to escape deer browse (

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2015c
 </xref>) and may affect soil microbial community ability to facilitate or suppress germination and growing conditions for other native species through plant-soil feedbacks (

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2007
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="plx026-B45" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). These indirect yet important non-consumptive deer effects have been overlooked until recently and they include demographic effects (
