<p>Legacy effects of prolonged high deer browse intensity often result in understories that show little response to deer reductions, especially by vulnerable species (

This may include not only greatly reduced deer abundance to provide safe spaces for recruitment, but also active restoration if we want to retain these species as part of our biological communities and heritage.
