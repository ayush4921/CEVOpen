0: The complexities and interconnectedness of local and regional ecosystems, as well as the many potential drivers of change (climate, invasive species, trophic downgrading, etc.)
1: ( Tylianakis   et al.
2: 2008 ;  Estes   et al.
3: 2011 ;  Craven   et al.
4: 2016 ), obscure the current and future implications of ungulate impacts.
5: Maintaining ecosystem function and ecosystem services requires high species diversity in multiple trophic groups including primary producers, above-ground insect herbivores and soil decomposers ( Soliveres   et al.
6: 2016 ;  van der Plas   et al.
7: 2016 ), organisms that are particularly negatively affected by high ungulate browse pressure ( Cote   et al.
8: 2004 ).
