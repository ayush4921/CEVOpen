0: The success of white-tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus) in North America illustrates a conservation success gone awry.
1: Hunted to near extinction by the late 1800s, the species made such a remarkable comeback that large populations quickly created economic and ecological problems ( Leopold   et al.
2: 1947 ;  Severinghouse and Brown 1956;  Halls 1984).
3: Scientists initially focused on selective effects of deer, primarily on valuable timber species ( Habeck 1959;  Frelich and Lorimer 1985;  Horsley   et al.
4: 2003 ).
5: While some browsing can have beneficial effects on plant diversity by reducing the competitive ability of some fast growing species ( Leonardsson   et al.
6: 2015 ), large ungulate populations often create simplified and less diverse ecosystems.
