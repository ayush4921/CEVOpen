0: An important concern is the long-term impact or legacy effects of high deer populations that act in concert with other stressors on local species assemblages and ecosystems.
1: This question has received less attention, although indirect or non-consumptive effects of white-tailed deer, including effects on introduced invasive plants or earthworms, are now being recognized ( Knight   et al.
2: 2009b ;  Heckel   et al.
3: 2010 ;  Kalisz   et al.
4: 2014 ; Davalos  et al.2015a, b, c).
5: Such perturbations may shift ecoystems into alternative stable states where restoration of a state resembling pre-perturbation conditions may be difficult or impossible ( Beisner   et al.
6: 2003 ;  Suding   et al.
7: 2004 ;  Suding 2011).
8: Persistent and excessive deer herbivory may create such a regime shift by simplifying primary producer communities setting forests on depauperate long-term trajectories ( Nuttle   et al.
9: 2011 ,  2014) and affecting ecosystem processes, such as decomposition ( Wardle and Bardgett 2004) and microbial community composition, that in turn affect plant growth and potentially net primary productivity ( Kardol   et al.
10: 2014 )
