<p>An important concern is the long-term impact or legacy effects of high deer populations that act in concert with other stressors on local species assemblages and ecosystems. This question has received less attention, although indirect or non-consumptive effects of white-tailed deer, including effects on introduced invasive plants or earthworms, are now being recognized (
