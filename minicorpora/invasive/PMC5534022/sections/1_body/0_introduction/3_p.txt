0: In the past decades, ecologists have documented cascading negative impacts of large deer populations ( Porter and Underwood 1999;  McShea and Rappole 2000;  Cote   et al.
1: 2004 ;  Griggs   et al.
2: 2006 ).
3: These effects percolate through food webs affecting directly the plant species eaten, and indirectly species such as insects, birds and decomposers, that are dependent upon the diversity of primary producers for their own existence and livelihoods ( Wardle and Bardgett 2004;  McGraw and Furedi 2005;  Martin   et al.
4: 2011 ;  Nuttle   et al.
5: 2011 ;  Schweitzer   et al.
6: 2014 ;  Chips   et al.
7: 2015 ).
8: This is not necessarily a new phenomenon because problems in Europe and North America have been reported for nearly a century or longer ( Leopold   et al.
9: 1947 ;  Schabel 2001;  Ammer   et al.
10: 2010 ).
