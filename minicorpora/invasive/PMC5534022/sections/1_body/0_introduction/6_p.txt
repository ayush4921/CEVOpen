0: It is widely assumed that reduction or cessation of high deer browse pressure will result in the recovery of understory plant communities but field tests of these assumptions are rare ( Tanentzap   et al.
1: 2011 ).
2: When hunting, culling and fencing are used to address excessive deer browse, managers typically, at least in hunting and culling efforts, report the number of deer removed or the resulting deer population density ( DeNicola 2008) (but see  Wright   et al.
3: 2012 ).
4: However, the extent to which vegetation recovery occurs is less often measured.
5: Furthermore, composition and abundance of understory vegetation are not necessarily linked to changes in deer abundance ( Tanentzap   et al.
6: 2011 ).
