0: We were particularly interested to assess the response of herbaceous understory vegetation to deer management in the presence of other persistent stressors, such as introduced plants and non-native earthworm invasions.
1: We used a 90 % reduction in the deer herd at Fermilab, IL, USA and an exclosure network at West Point, NY, USA, to test the following hypotheses:  Reduced deer browse pressure will result in recovery of forest understory plant community.Reduced deer browse pressure will result in recovery of species highly favoured by deer.Deer browse pressure overwhelms negative effects of other co-occurring stressors, specifically non-native plants and non-native earthworms, on native plant species performance
