0: Community: In 1992 we divided the forest into five 90-m wide units, each with a randomly established permanent transect (420560 m).
1: In May of even-numbered years (19922006) we recorded species presence, and estimated percent cover for each species<1 m tall in 17 cover categories (midpoints: 0.01, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 98 and 100 %) in 1 m 2 quadrats randomly located within contiguous 20 m intervals along each transect (121129 quadrats each year).
2: Plant species nomenclature and native/non-native origin follows the USDA Plants Database ( USDA NRCS 2017).
3: Beginning in 1998 we measured average vegetation height to the nearest cm.
4: While this is a quantitative measurement of a qualitative feature, all measurements were made in a consistent manner, and gross differences are assumed to be indicative of true height differences.
5: In 2004 and 2006 we recorded species presence and height in all quadrats, and percent cover of individual species in alternate quadrats (69 and 65, respectively).
6: We summed cover of all species within a quadrat using cover class midpoint values: thus, total cover could exceed 100 % due to layering.
7: We classified each species by origin (native or non-native) and life form (annual and biennial forb combined, hereafter referred to as (bi)annual, perennial forb, graminoid, and woody).
8: Graminoids included all grass-like plants (Poaceae, Cyperaceae and Juncacaeae).
9: Ferns were so infrequent that they were combined with perennial forbs.
