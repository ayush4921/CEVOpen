0: U.S. DOE Fermilab National Environmental Research Park (hereafter Fermilab) is located 60 km west of Chicago, in Kane County, IL, USA and contains a mixture of forests, oldfields, restored prairies and active farm lands on 27.5 km 2.
1: We selected the largest forest on the site, a 31.6-ha mesic forest (Big Woods) dominated by  Tilia americana, Fraxinus americana, Quercus macrocarpa and  Q. alba, and known for extensive spring displays of  Trillium flexipes and  T. recurvatum.
2: The forest had been grazed some time prior to establishment of the Research Park.
3: A rapidly expanding deer herd and concomitant decline in  Trillium floral displays prompted research to assess deer impacts on understory vegetation.
4: White-tailed deer densities averaged 11/km 2 in 1993, and 24.6/km 2 in 1998, according to winter aerial surveys.
5: Deer densities were reduced 90 % in winter 1998/1999 and were subsequently maintained using sharpshooters at approximately the same density (2.56/km 2) each year thereafter.
