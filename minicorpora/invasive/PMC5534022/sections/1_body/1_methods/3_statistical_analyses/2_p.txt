0: West Point analyses are based on maximum species cover between May and July for each sampling year (20092012).
1: We used Linear Mixed Models (LMM) to evaluate effects of year, site invasion (sites selected based on presence and abundance of three non-native plant species), fencing (fenced or open), earthworm density (low or high based on earthworm monitoring results) and their interactions on total cover, species richness and diversity indexes.
2: We dropped non-significant factors from the final model.
3: We tested second level interactions only, excluding the site invasion  earthworm density interaction as we only had one site dominated by non-native vegetation with low earthworm density.
4: We applied a second set of LMM models to evaluate effects of year, fencing, earthworm density, plant species origin, and their interactions on total cover and cover by life form (different models for each life form).
5: We did not evaluate site invasion in models that separated species cover by lifeform as site invasion and plant species origin are not independent: Sites classified as invaded will, by definition, have higher cover of non-natives.
6: All models included site, plot within site and quadrat within plot as random factors in order to reflect the hierarchical nature of the data.
7: Including random factors allowed us to control for possible pseudoreplication while preserving the spatial variation contained in data collected among quadrats within the same plot ( Millar and Anderson 2004;  Schank and Koehnle 2009).
