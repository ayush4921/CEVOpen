<p>We evaluated effect of deer reduction on understory plant communities at Fermilab by comparing cover, species richness and vegetation height values pre (before 1998) and post deer reduction [a fixed factor with two levels (before and after): GLMMs with study year as a random factor to account for temporal correlation within years]. Samples within Fermilab (all at one site) were considered independent. At both Fermilab and West Point we classified each species by origin (native or non-native) and life-form (annual and biennial forb, perennial forb, graminoid [Poaceae, Cyperaceae and Juncacaeae], ferns and fern allies, and woody). Also for both studies, we transformed cover values (arcsine squared-root) and species richness (log) in order to meet model assumptions.</p>
