0: We used Linear Mixed Models to evaluate effects on individual species cover and height and Generalized Linear Mixed Models with binomial errors to evaluate effects on species frequency or flowering probability.
1: Trillium recurvatum models at Fermilab evaluated changes before and after deer reduction (a fixed factor with two levels [before and after]) and included sampling year as a random factor to account for temporal correlation within years.
2: Models for West Point evaluated the effects of fencing, earthworm density and site invasion and included site and plot within site as random factors.
