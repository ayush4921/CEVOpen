0: In late July 20082011 we randomly selected 5 of the 10 vegetation quadrats within each open and fenced plot, stratified equally across the plot, and sampled earthworms within a 0.25-m 2 frame placed 1 m distant from the vegetation quadrat.
1: To ensure equal sampling of plots over time, we rerandomized sample locations each year.
2: We removed and sifted all leaf litter, capturing any earthworms, then firmly placed a metal frame (10 cm  25 cm  25 cm) on the ground.
3: We then poured 3.79 L of aqueous mustard solution (15 g L 1; Frontier Natural Products Co-op, Norway, IA) evenly across the frame area, and collected all surfacing earthworms.
4: We preserved specimens in 10 % formalin before transferring to 70 % ethanol, then weighed and identified each individual to species (sexually mature worms) or genus (immature worms).
5: Sites varied in earthworm abundance and species composition, naturally grouping into either high (12.4   1.78 individuals and 8.6   1.67 g per 0.25 m 2; means   1 SE: eight sites) or low (1.4   0.37 individuals and 0.88   0.36 g per 0.25 m 2; means   1 SE: four sites) earthworm abundance based on means from 2008 to 2011 ( Davalos   et al.
6: 2015c ).
7: We only recorded non-native earthworm species.
8: Common genera included  Amynthas, Dendrobaena and  Lumbricus.
