0: US Army Garrison West Point (hereafter West Point) is a 65-km 2 site located on the west bank of the Hudson River some 80 km north of New York City, NY, USA.
1: This facility is located in the Hudson Highlands Province, a landscape characterized by steep hills, thin soils and rocky outcrops.
2: We selected 12 upland deciduous forests (18 km apart from each other) dominated by oak ( Q. rubra and  Q. prinus) and/or sugar maple ( Acer saccharum); sites differed in land use history, aspect, soil and understory vegetation.
3: Our investigations focused, in part, on the importance of non-native invasive plants, non-native invasive earthworms and their individual, additive or synergistic interactions with white-tailed deer and the resulting impacts on native plant species.
4: We therefore selected 12 sites based on site invasion: 6 sites based on presence and abundance of 3 non-native plant species ( Alliaria petiolata,  Berberis thunbergii, Microstegium vimineum; two sites each) and six sites that had few or no non-native plant species present (please see  Table 1 in  Davalos   et al.
5: 2015c ).
6: At each site we established two paired 30 m  30 m plots, 550 m apart, with similar overstory and understory composition of which one was randomly selected to be fenced.
7: In early July 2008 we constructed deer-proof 2.6 m high fences (Millennium plastic deer fence,  deerBusters.com).
