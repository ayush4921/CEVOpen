0: In mid-June 2012 we randomly located four 2 m  30 m belt transects in each fenced plot at sites 5 and 8 and recorded stem height (cm, measured from ground to highest leaf node), width (cm) of the widest leaf, and reproductive status of each  M. racemosum and  P. pubescens.
1: We found very few (or no) plants in belt transects in open plots; therefore we randomly established additional transects near open plots for a total of eight belt transects at site 5 in 2012 (seven transects in 2016) and nine transects at site 8.
2: We repeated these measures in approximately the same locations in late May 2016.
