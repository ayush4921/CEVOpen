0: Individual species: We selected three native perennial plant species favoured by deer ( Eurybia divaricata,  Maianthemum racemosum and  Polygonatum pubescens) in 2012 for additional study.
1: We assessed all sites for presence of each species but collected data only at sites where we could find a minimum number of individuals in both open and fenced plots (2 sites for  M. racemosum and  P. pubescens [25 plants/plot minimum] and 6 sites for  E. divaricata [50 plants/plot minimum]).
