0: Community: We established ten 1 m 2 permanent quadrats in a stratified random manner in each fenced and open plot in July 2008 (11 sites) or May 2009 (1 site) (12 sites  2 plots per site  10 quadrats per plot = 240 vegetation quadrats).
1: Within each quadrat we recorded species presence, and estimated the percent cover for each species<1 m tall in 17 cover categories (midpoints: 0.01, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 98 and 100 %).
2: Plant species nomenclature and native/non-native status follows USDA Plants ( USDA NRCS 2017).
3: We recorded data twice a year, in mid-May (20092012) and late July (20082012), and again in May 2016.
4: We estimated vegetation height by measuring the average height of vegetation at four locations within each quadrat, and then averaging these heights for each quadrat.
5: We classified each species by origin and life form, and summed cover of individual plant species as described above under Fermilab.
