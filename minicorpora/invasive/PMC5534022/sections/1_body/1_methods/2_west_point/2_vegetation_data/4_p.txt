0: In mid-September 2012 we recorded density, height, and reproductive status of each  E. divaricata in the 10 permanent 1 m 2 quadrats in each open and fenced plot at the six sites that contained this species.
1: If  E. divaricata was not present in the initial quadrat location, we searched for the closest  E. divaricata, and then placed the quadrat with the plant in one corner and shifted to maximize number of plants in the re-established quadrat.
2: Thus, we recorded frequency and cover in initial quadrats, and plant vigor in initial and additional quadrats.
