<p>At the island scale, invasive species showed considerable variation in diversity (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32984-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; Table 
 <xref rid="ece32984-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). The island with the lowest number of invasive species was St Lucia (24 species), while Cuba with 306 species was the island with the highest number of invasive species (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32984-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). However, when evaluating invasive species diversity relative to island area, we found that St Martin has the highest density of invasive species (0.407 species per km
 <sup>2</sup>) followed by the Virgin Islands (0.245 species per km
 <sup>2</sup>), whereas Dominican Republic (0.003 species per km
 <sup>2</sup>) and Cuba (0.002 species per km
 <sup>2</sup>) showed the lowest density values (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32984-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). When comparing the number of invasive species relative to the total number of alien plant species reported for each island (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32984-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c; Table 
 <xref rid="ece32984-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>), Trinidad and Tobago was found to have the highest proportion of alien plant species that have become invasive (54%), followed by St Martin (40%) and Cuba (38%). In contrast, Jamaica (6%) and St Lucia (8%) are the islands with the lowest proportion of alien plant species becoming invasive. At the regional scale, the 516 invasive species included in our database represent 27% of all alien plant species recorded for the West Indies (ca. 1,879 alien plant species, Table 
 <xref rid="ece32984-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>).
