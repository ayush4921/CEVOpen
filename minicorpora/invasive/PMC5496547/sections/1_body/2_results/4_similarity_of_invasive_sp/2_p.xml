<p>The nine islands analyzed show different patterns of similarities relative to their invasive species richness, with Sørensen coefficients varying from 81.9 to 2.5 (average = 21,

 <xref rid="ece32984-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap">2</xref>). Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands are the most similar islands, sharing 122 invasive species, while St Lucia and Trinidad and Tobago are the most dissimilar, sharing only a single species (Table 
 <xref rid="ece32984-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap">2</xref>). The Mantel test showed no significant correlation between Sorensen's index and geographical distance among islands (
