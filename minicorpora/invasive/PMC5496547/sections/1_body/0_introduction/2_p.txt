0: Vascular plants are among the most common invasive organisms, as they are often introduced for agricultural, agroforestry, and ornamental purposes (D'Antonio, Jackson, Horvitz, & Hedberg,  2004; Daehler,  2003; Pysek et al.,  2012).
1: The probability of introduction, establishment, and spread of invasive plant species (the introductionnaturalizationinvasion continuum) is affected by geographical, ecological, and socioeconomic features of the invaded area (i.e., climate, resource availability, and demand for certain goods and services; Catford, Jansson, & Nilsson,  2009; Pysek & Richardson,  2006; Reaser et al.,  2007; Richardson & Pysek,  2012), by external factors such as the initial population size, residence time, and propagule pressure (Catford, Vesk, White, & Wintle,  2011; Lockwood, Cassey, & Blackburn,  2005; Trueman et al.,  2010), and by inherent species traits influencing its ability to survive, reproduce, disperse, and interact with other species, native or alien, already resident in the area (Pysek & Richardson,  2006; RojasSandoval & AcevedoRodriguez,  2015).
