0: In this study, we used data on invasive plant species collected on nine island groups to identify patterns of invasion across the West Indies.
1: Although several studies and checklists of alien and invasive plants have been produced for some of these islands (Kairo, Ali, Cheesman, Haysom, & Murphy,  2003; Oviedo et al.,  2012; RojasSandoval & AcevedoRodriguez,  2015; Van der Burg, Freitas, Debrot, & Lotz,  2012), there have been no systematic studies comparing the patterns of invasion at the regional scale.
2: Moreover, assessments of factors influencing invasibility and invasiveness are still limited for the West Indies (but see Ackerman et al.,  2014; Ackerman, Tremblay, RojasSandoval, & HernandezFigueroa,  2017; RojasSandoval & AcevedoRodriguez,  2015).
3: Within this context, the main goals of this work were to: (1) describe the invasive flora of nine island groups across the West Indies, (2) evaluate the similarity of the invasive floras between islands, and (3) identify and evaluate geographical, ecological, and socioeconomic factors that best correlate with the invasive species diversity on these islands.
4: The results derived from this study provide a general perspective of the patterns of distribution of invasive species within the Caribbean region and may serve as a base for future comparative studies on plant invasions and the design of management strategies to control and mitigate the impact of invasive plants on these islands.
