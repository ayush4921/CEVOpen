0: Islands provide exceptional systems for testing hypotheses on biological invasions (Denslow, Space, & Thomas,  2009; Kueffer et al.,  2010; Simberloff,  2000).
1: Island communities have been regarded as more vulnerable to biological invasions than continental ecosystems due to their relatively higher numbers and densities of alien species (D'Antonio & Dudley,  1995; Denslow,  2003; Pysek & Richardson,  2006; Sax, Gaines, & Brown,  2002).
2: Nevertheless, this apparent vulnerability of islands to biological invasion, which has been considered as one of the classic generalizations in invasion ecology, remains debatable.
3: The high rates of invasibility and naturalization of alien plant species observed on temperate and tropical islands have been traditionally explained by inherent features of islands such as their geographical and historical isolation, high habitat diversity, disharmonic and unsaturated floras, low biotic resistance, and low pest pressures, which are factors that would provide limited barriers to the establishment and naturalization of alien plants (D'Antonio & Dudley,  1995; Denslow,  2003; Mack et al.,  2000; Simberloff,  1995).
4: However, these assumptions have been rarely supported by empirical data and other insular features such as small territories, reduced habitats, and small population sizes have been proposed as alternative explanations (Simberloff,  1995,  2000).
5: Although the susceptibility to biological invasion does not necessarily coincide with the vulnerability to the deleterious effects caused by the spread of alien species, there is a consensus that islands are more susceptible to the effects of invasive species than continental ecosystems (D'Antonio & Dudley,  1995; Pysek et al.,  2012; Reaser et al.,  2007).
6: Insular biotas are considered to be fragile ecosystems characterized by high levels of endemism (AcevedoRodriguez & Strong,  2008; Whittaker & FernandezPalacios,  2008).
7: On these biotas, the introduction of alien species could lead to changes in community structure and the loss of native species, ecosystem functions, and services (Reaser et al.,  2007; RojasSandoval, MelendezAckerman, & AnglesAlcazar,  2016; Spotswood, Meyer, & Bartolome,  2012).
8: In many cases, these changes lead to taxonomic and functional simplification, a phenomenon known as biotic homogenization, which has been extensively investigated for oceanic islands (Castro et al.,  2010; Castro & Jaksic,  2008; Stohlgren et al.,  2011; Vergara, Pizarro, & Castro,  2011).
