0: We collected information on the presence of invasive plant species for the following nine island groups and/or political units: (1) Bahamas, (2) Cuba, (3) Dominican Republic, (4) Jamaica, (5) Puerto Rico, (6) Virgin Islands (including the British and the U.S. Virgin Islands), (7) St. Lucia, (8) St. Martin (including the Dutch and French parts of the island), and (9) Trinidad and Tobago (Table  1).
1: These island groups (hereafter  islands) are characterized by a wide variety of environmental, geographical, and socioeconomic attributes (Table  1).
2: The largest island included in this study is Cuba (109,820 km 2), and the smallest island is St Martin (88 km 2).
3: In the case of the British and the U.S. Virgin Islands, we decided to aggregate the information as a single unit because they share similar geographical and ecological histories and thus similar microclimates, habitats, and plant diversity (AcevedoRodriguez & Strong,  2012).
