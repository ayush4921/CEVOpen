<p>The 55 aquatic nonindigenous plant species of the Laurentian Great Lakes form a unique subset of the overall invasion of this important freshwater resource. At least 46 native plant species in the Great Lakes—including many designated by local jurisdictions as endangered, threatened, or otherwise at risk—are significantly impacted by competition from nonindigenous aquatic plants. The adaptations that give these nonindigenous species a competitive advantage over native species are diverse.</p>
