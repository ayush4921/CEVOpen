  <p>For 35% of the aquatic nonindigenous plants species in the Great Lakes, it is unknown whether they have an outcome-based competitive impact on native plants. Further study of potential competitive impacts is needed for each of these 20 species.</p>

  <p>While for many nonindigenous aquatic plant species extensive information is available on species traits that may contribute to giving the nonindigenous species a competitive advantage over native species, a direct mechanistic-based examination of the competition between these species is generally lacking and is an area ripe for future research.</p>

  <p>For some nonindigenous aquatic plant species, competitive impacts to native species are documented only at the group level (e.g., impact to native sedges). More work is needed to understand the impacts on particular native plant species within these broader groups, which may include additional at risk natives.</p>

  <p>Competition is only one interaction through which nonindigenous aquatic plants can impact the ecology and economy of the Great Lakes region. More research is needed to place competitive impacts in the context of the broader suite of impact mechanisms.</p>

  <p>The potential alteration of several adaptations (e.g., environmental tolerance and light competition) as a result of climate change should be studied to properly understand how the nature of competition between nonindigenous and native plants may change under various climate scenarios.</p>
