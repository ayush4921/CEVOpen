<p>The GLANSIS database carefully documents the historic distributions of each included species within the Great Lakes basin. Original data are drawn from the peer-reviewed literature, from state agency reports, from museum and herbaria collections, from data-sharing arrangements (limited to verified data) with other state and regional databases, and from other forms of verified reports. GLANSIS relies heavily on data-sharing arrangements with other platforms to compile these verified reports as well as accepts direct reports into the system but does not accept unverified direct reports from the general public or other databases (unless also verified by GLANSIS or United States Geological Survey staff). Overall, the GLANSIS database includes more than 40,000 point mapped collection records for nonindigenous aquatic plants in the basin, ranging from only 2 verified records for 
 <italic>Salix caprea</italic> to 6189 verified records for 
 <italic>Lythrum salicaria</italic>. Each species profile includes an interactive point map that allows public access to the original report source. The original source for each record is available through GLANSIS (link below the map for each species). Distribution data can also be downloaded as Geographic Information System layers via the GLANSIS Map Explorer interface. The map presented above (
