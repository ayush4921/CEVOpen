 <italic>Phragmites australis</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>australis</italic> was included in the GLANSIS database as a nonnative taxa meeting criteria above and, therefore, was also included in this analysis. However, it is worth noting that 
 <italic>Phragmites australis</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>americanus</italic> is native to the Great Lakes region. Records and information for 
 <italic>Phragmites australis</italic> is included only to the extent that it is identified to the subspecies level; this effectively excludes a large body of literature and records that fail to make identification to the subspecies level.
