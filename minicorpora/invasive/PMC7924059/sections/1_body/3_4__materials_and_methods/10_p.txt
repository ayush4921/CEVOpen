0: GLANSIS includes a profile for each nonindigenous species present in the Great Lakes.
1: These are reviewed at least every fifth year (alongside the assessments) and updated as needed.
2: All original profiles and major updates are subjected to external expert review.
3: These species profiles include a segment on means of introduction, which summarizes the vectors involved in the movement of the species to the Great Lakes.
4: This documentation is used in the vector analysis presented here.
5: These species profiles also include segments on identification, ecology, and management, which includes information on growth habits, habitat, physiological requirements and tolerances, food web interactions (including possible herbivore resistance), life history, fecundity, and control methods (including notes on herbicide resistance).
6: All information used for the assessment of nonindigenous plant adaptations favoring competition over native plants was drawn from these profiles and/or the risk assessments.
7: The profiles also include citations of the original studies from which all information is compiled.
