0: Staff affiliated with GLANSIS have conducted comprehensive impact assessments for the overwintering and reproducing aquatic nonindigenous species of the Great Lakes since approximately 2010 using a protocol detailed in NOAA Tech Memo 161 [ 29].
1: All relevant original literature (excluding duplicates) are entered into the database and available through the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) reference database ( https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/references/default.aspx accessed on 15 January 2021) as well as linked from each GLANSIS profile; the total literature included in the NAS database for the 55 aquatic nonindigenous plant species included in this paper exceeds 3500 original sources.
2: A subset of this literature (639 original sources for aquatic nonindigenous plants) was used in the development of impact assessments.
3: Most sources are from peer-reviewed literature and/or government reports and include direct laboratory and field observations of competitive impacts as well as observations of decline in native plant species concomitant with expansion of the nonindigenous species.
4: Statements appearing in the peer-reviewed literature that constitute expert opinion (e.g., statements in discussion and conclusion sections) are included but flagged in the assessments in a way that influences final categorization toward unknown.
5: Each assessment is reviewed and updated at least every fifth year based on a review of new literature and subject to external review.
6: Full results of these impact assessments for each species, including all original references used in the development of both the full assessment and the particular subset examined here, are available in the Appendices of TM-161, TM-161b, and TM-161c [ 29, 30, 31].
7: Additional unpublished impact data may in some cases be attached to each collection record; while nominally accessible individually via the database, these are not easily extracted as a whole set from the current portal and are largely excluded from this analysis unless also noted in the Technical Memo series.
8: Current summaries for each species (and critical literature citations) are also available online at  https://www.glerl.noaa.gov/glansis (accessed on 15 January 2021).
