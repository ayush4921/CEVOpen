<p>The core current secondary analysis presented here is based on a single qualitative component from the larger assessment. Under the category of environmental impact, we assessed the question “Does it [the particular species assessed] outcompete native species for available resources (e.g., habitat, food, nutrients, light)?” Each species is noted as either of the following:
 <list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <p>yes, and it has resulted in significant adverse effects (e.g., critical reduction, extinction, and behavioral changes) on one or more native species populations;</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>yes, and it has caused some noticeable stress to or decline of at least one native species population;</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>not significantly; or</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>unknown.</p>
  </list-item>
 </list>
