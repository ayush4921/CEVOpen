 <italic>Nitellopsis obtusa</italic>, starry stonewort, was the only nonindigenous macroalgae included in the GLANSIS database. This species has more in common with the nonindigenous aquatic plants than it does with the 26 species of planktonic algae also meeting listing criteria and included in the GLANSIS database. Thus, we chose to include starry stonewort in this analysis.
