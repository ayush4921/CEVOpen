<p>The Laurentian Great Lakes are home to thousands of native fishes, invertebrates, plants, and other species that not only provide recreational and economic value to the region but also hold an important ecological value. With more than 180 aquatic nonindigenous species documented in the region, the Great Lakes basin is considered one of the most heavily invaded aquatic systems in the world [

 <xref rid="B18-plants-10-00406" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Some of these nonindigenous species may become invasive (i.e., “those species whose introduction does or is likely to cause economic or environmental harm or harm to human health” [
