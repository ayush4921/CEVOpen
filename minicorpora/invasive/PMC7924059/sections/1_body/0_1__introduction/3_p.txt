0: Of these 180+ known Great Lakes nonindigenous species, 55 (29%) are plants ( Table 1).
1: Aquatic plants have been among the most neglected components in ecological studies of aquatic ecosystems [ 20] and the Great Lakes are no exception.
2: However, aquatic plants play a major role in ecosystem services associated with the value we place on these systems.
3: By providing food and habitat for fish and aquatic invertebrates, oxygenating the water, limiting erosion, and influencing nutrient levels, plants contribute extensively to the overall structure and function of aquatic environments [ 21].
4: Impairments to aquatic plants thus have the potential to negatively affect a wide range of services as well as ecosystems as a whole.
