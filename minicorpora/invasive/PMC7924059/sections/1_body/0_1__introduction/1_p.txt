0: Freshwater ecosystems have been deeply transformed by invasive species [ 1, 2].
1: Nonindigenous aquatic plants have been identified as a major cause of biodiversity loss in many countries [ 3, 4].
2: Problems associated with the spread of nonindigenous aquatic plant species are increasing in Europe and the Mediterranean [ 5, 6, 7], Australia [ 8], South Africa [ 9], tropical inland waters worldwide [ 10], and North America [ 11, 12, 13].
3: However, there are few studies of the patterns in community structure and composition available for aquatic plants, as are common in terrestrial communities [ 14] or even for planktonic microflora [ 15].
