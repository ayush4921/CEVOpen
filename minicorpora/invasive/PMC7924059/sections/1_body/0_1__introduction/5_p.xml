<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s (NOAA) Great Lakes Aquatic Nonindigenous Species Information System (GLANSIS) serves as a regional information clearinghouse for science-based information supporting management of aquatic nonindigenous species in the Great Lakes. GLANSIS provides comprehensive bibliographies, systematic review, summary profiles of each species, distribution mapping, and impact assessment for each of the nonindigenous species overwintering and reproducing below the ordinary high water mark of the Great Lakes, including 55 nonindigenous species of aquatic plants. Here, we examine the subset of the database that addresses the competitive impacts of the nonindigenous aquatic plants. It is our aim that this review serves as a synthesis of regional information on the impacts of aquatic nonindigenous plants to native aquatic plants via competition, much of which is not otherwise readily available, a proof-of-concept for the value of inclusion of impact information (even qualitative) in invasive species databases, and highlights potentially important future research needs.</p>
