0: The impact of nonindigenous aquatic plants on native aquatic plants is examined here only in the context of impact through competition.
1: Competition has long been recognized as a significant driver of community succession [ 23] and structure [ 24], which are critical components of impact, but studies of these interactions in aquatic plant communities remain rare [ 25].
2: Our operational definition of competition is quite broad, encompassing any negative interference of one plant over another in capturing resources, most notably space.
3: We include direct and indirect negative impacts, ability to tolerate or avoid suppression, resource competition (for light, water, nutrients, etc.
4: ), and interference competition (such as allelopathy) [ 26, 27].
5: We categorize competition primarily in broad qualitative outcome-oriented terms, (a) significant adverse effects (e.g., critical reduction, extinction, and behavioral changes) on one or more native species populations and (b) noticeable stress to or decline of at least one native species population, and only secondarily review and categorize potential mechanisms (species traits) identified in the database profiles.
