<p>Of these 180+ known Great Lakes nonindigenous species, 55 (29%) are plants (

 <xref rid="B20-plants-10-00406" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and the Great Lakes are no exception. However, aquatic plants play a major role in ecosystem services associated with the value we place on these systems. By providing food and habitat for fish and aquatic invertebrates, oxygenating the water, limiting erosion, and influencing nutrient levels, plants contribute extensively to the overall structure and function of aquatic environments [
