<p>Reproductive strategies are noted as aiding in competition and as common characteristics of successful invasive species [
 <xref rid="B112-plants-10-00406" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]; nine species examined here are identified as having adaptations in this category. Here again, we defined the category broadly and qualitatively, including adaptations relating to pollination, seed set, dispersal, seed banks, and seed viability. 
 <italic>Chenopodium glaucum</italic> and 
 <italic>Echinochloa crus-galli</italic> are self-pollinators [
 <xref rid="B113-plants-10-00406" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>,
 <xref rid="B114-plants-10-00406" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. 
 <italic>Impatiens glandulifera</italic> and 
 <italic>Iris pseudacorus</italic> are considered superior competitors for the attention of pollinators [
 <xref rid="B115-plants-10-00406" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>,
 <xref rid="B116-plants-10-00406" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>,
 <xref rid="B117-plants-10-00406" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>,
 <xref rid="B118-plants-10-00406" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. 
 <italic>Cirsium palustre</italic> is a monocarpic perennial that can delay seed-set until conditions are ideal [
 <xref rid="B119-plants-10-00406" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>,
 <xref rid="B120-plants-10-00406" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. Long-distance spread of seeds with relatively high viability is noted as improving competition for 
 <italic>Najas marina</italic> [
 <xref rid="B121-plants-10-00406" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>], extremely high seed-set and long-lived seed influences competition in favor of 
 <italic>Lythrum salicaria</italic> [
 <xref rid="B122-plants-10-00406" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>], and dominance of viable seeds in the seed bank is also a factor for 
 <italic>Juncus inflexus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B123-plants-10-00406" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. Similarly, twigs of 
 <italic>Salix fragilis</italic> can float downstream and take root, which allows the species to spread rapidly and influences its ability to outcompete natives [
 <xref rid="B124-plants-10-00406" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>].
