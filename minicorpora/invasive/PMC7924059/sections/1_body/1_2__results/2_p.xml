<p>At present, most of these nonindigenous aquatic plant species are widespread throughout the Great Lakes basin, though not every species is found in every sub-watershed (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00406-f002">Figure 2</xref>). However, a distinct pattern is apparent, wherein the lower lakes (Lake Erie and Lake Ontario)—which are both downstream and more southern—host more aquatic nonindigenous plant species per watershed than the upper lakes. It remains uncertain whether the lack of reports for the upper peninsula of Michigan (south of Lake Superior, with low human population density) represents a true lack of invasion or an underreporting of occurrences in these areas.
