<p>Just under half of the 55 nonindigenous plant species in the Laurentian Great Lakes have some level of reported competitive impacts on native plants. Most of these reports are observational and qualitative in the original sources, not quantitative. Five species (
 <italic>Lythrum salicaria</italic>, 
 <italic>Typha angustifolia</italic>, 
 <italic>Iris pseudacorus</italic>, 
 <italic>Frangula alnus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Phragmites australis</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>australis</italic>) were found to have significant adverse effects as a result of competing with native plant species, and 19 were found to have resulted in some noticeable stress to or decline of at least one native plant population attributed to competition. Sufficient evidence concludes that 11 species have had no significant competition-based impacts to native plants in the Great Lakes basin (but may have had other significant impacts not related to competition).
