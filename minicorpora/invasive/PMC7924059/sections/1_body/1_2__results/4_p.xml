<p>For the remaining 20 species (35%), too little information was available to draw conclusions about whether competitive impacts occur in the Great Lakes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00406-f003">Figure 3</xref>). These unknowns occur either because there is a lack of relevant literature or because sources disagree on the impact. Review of the literature for each of the 55 nonindigenous aquatic plants in the Great Lakes region revealed an average of just 3.5 citations per species relevant to the question of impacts of these species via competition (range 0 to 16). Cited studies contributing to “unknown” classification include those with a preponderance of published expert opinion (e.g., in the discussion or conclusion of a published paper) rather than reliance on direct laboratory or field evidence of competition.
