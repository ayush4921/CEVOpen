<p>The history of nonindigenous aquatic plants in the Great Lakes is long and differs markedly from the overall pattern of invasion for the Great Lakes [
 <xref rid="B11-plants-10-00406" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Records show that the first nonindigenous aquatic plant (
 <italic>Rumex obtusifolius</italic>) was introduced to the Great Lakes basin around 1837 [
 <xref rid="B28-plants-10-00406" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Forty aquatic plant species were introduced prior to 1920, while only 15 were introduced within the last century, with the peak rate of introduction occurring in the early 1880s (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00406-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Fifty-five percent of the introductions of nonindigenous plants to the Great Lakes are attributed to deliberate introductions, while 18% came from shipping vectors (solid ballast and ballast water). This contrasts with the pattern for all nonindigenous introductions to the Great Lakes, which peaked in the late 1990s, with 20% of the introductions (including plants) associated with deliberate introductions and 40% associated with shipping [
 <xref rid="B11-plants-10-00406" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Aquatic nonindigenous plants thus form a unique subset of the overall invasion of the Great Lakes.
