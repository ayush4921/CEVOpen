<p>Competition between plants is driven by the traits that allow plants to capture resources and to monopolize space. Understanding the mechanisms that enable plants to compete for limiting resources can foster better predictions regarding competitive outcomes and the consequences of competition [
 <xref rid="B26-plants-10-00406" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Our review of the literature (including literature from the Great Lakes region, from other regions where the plant is invasive, and from the native ranges) reveals that aquatic plants nonnative to the Great Lakes region have a diverse array of adaptations that may help them outcompete native species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00406-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Adaptations that have been previously found to aid successful invasions were common in 98% of plant species in the database. Many of these are common adaptations of wetland plants in fluctuating environments and may also be characteristics of some or even many Great Lakes native species; thus, we provide this list of adaptations only as a starting point for future investigations into the mechanisms behind competition. It is possible that there are many more cases of adaptations by nonindigenous plants conferring a competitive advantage that have yet to be documented due to a lack of research. Even within our very broad and qualitative categories, there is significant diversity of adaptations. Many species have multiple adaptations, with an average of 1.9 adaptation categories per species (range 0 to 6). We do not attempt to discuss the relative significance of particular adaptations within a species or across the suite because the adaptations were most often noted in distinct habitats and studied using different methods, which impedes meaningful comparison. The general principles of invasion mechanisms are unlikely to hold up across ecosystem types, but it is worth searching for general patterns within distinct ecosystem units [
