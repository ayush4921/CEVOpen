<p>Nonetheless, many of these nonindigenous species have notable impacts to the native plant communities of the region. At least 46 native species are identified as significantly impacted by competition from these invasive species, including many species designated legally as of special concern (endangered, threatened, etc.). These numbers likely do not adequately capture the true magnitude of competitive impact as many additional studies highlight impact to native assemblages (e.g., “high marsh community” and “sedges”) without calling out the individual species impacted. Likewise, many studies of native communities note that they are “impacted by competition from invasives” without specifying which invasive species are responsible. These impacts are widespread; sub-watersheds of the region average 14 nonindigenous aquatic plant species each, and none remain untouched by nonindigenous aquatic plants. The five invasive aquatic plants falling in our top tier for “significant adverse effects” due to competition (documented as responsible for critical reduction, extinction, or behavioral changes to one or more native species populations) include 
 <italic>Lythrum salicaria</italic>, 
 <italic>Typha angustifolia</italic>, 
 <italic>Iris pseudacorus</italic>, 
 <italic>Frangula alnus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Phragmites australis</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>australis.</italic> All five are widespread emergent wetland plants first introduced to the region more than a century ago. Each of these species have at least two documented adaptations that contribute to their being superior competitors over the native plants, and collectively, they cover nearly the entire array of adaptation categories.
