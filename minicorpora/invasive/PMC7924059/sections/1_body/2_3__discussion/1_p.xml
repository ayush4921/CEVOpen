<p>Aquatic nonindigenous plants form a unique subset of the invasion history of the Great Lakes. Despite an invasion record spanning nearly two centuries (1837â€“2020), a great deal remains unknown about these species; for 35% of the species, the impact to native plants via competition remains unknown at even the coarsest level (significant/noted/none documented). Additional data collection is needed for all nonindigenous aquatic plant species to determine, refine, and quantify competitive impacts.</p>
