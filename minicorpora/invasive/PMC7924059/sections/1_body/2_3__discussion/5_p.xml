<p>Other nonindigenous aquatic plants species noted in the literature as “broadly tolerant” or tolerant of a range of soil, nutrient, water, and other conditions are able to spread more broadly in part because of these tolerances and, thus, are competitive in a broader array of habitats, in disturbed habitats, and/or in habitats where conditions fluctuate. While not tidal, water level fluctuations at both short and long temporal scales are a common feature of the Great Lakes nearshore. Storm surge and subsequent seiches in the Great Lakes can cause water levels to change in excess of 2 m in under an hour. Annual cycles typically place average summer high water levels a half-meter or more above the winter low, and longer term fluctuations (climate signals) are also apparent in the historic record (

For inland waters and managed wetlands of the region, water level control (drawdowns and/or flooding) is often used as a management strategy for controlling nonindigenous species (both plants and fish). Broadly tolerant species, particularly those with respect to water depth, may be at a competitive advantage in these fluctuating systems.
