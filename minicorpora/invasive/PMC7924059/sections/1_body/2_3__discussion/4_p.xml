<p>The prevalence of salt-tolerant species (five nonindigenous aquatic plants in this analysis) among the invaders of freshwaters is an interesting case that may be worthy of additional study. Salt contamination (largely from road salt) is a significant issue for many historically freshwater wetlands and marginal habitats (such as roadside ditches) in the region [
