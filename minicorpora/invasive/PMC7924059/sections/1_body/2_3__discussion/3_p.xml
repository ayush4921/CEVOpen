<p>Adaptations categorized as environmental tolerances (23 species), contaminant tolerances (6 species), nutrient competition (7 species), and light competition (14 species) all likely serve to help species gain a competitive advantage in particular microhabitats or under fluctuating conditions. Many aquatic nonindigenous plant species have specific tolerances that help them to outcompete natives in particular habitat types, such as sites contaminated with heavy metals, salt, or nitrogen or sites experiencing eutrophication, turbidity, or acidification. These tolerances likely contribute to these nonindigenous species, gaining a foothold in disturbed sites. Some appear to remain restricted to these marginal habitats, while others spread to more pristine habitats. This finding supports the general hypothesis that aquatic plant species differ in their responses to sediment composition and irradiance [

 <xref rid="B25-plants-10-00406" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], they allowed the possibility that interspecific competition could occur during establishment phase, which would be a more critical consideration for interactions between nonindigenous and native plants in comparison to the interactions among native species that they were studying.
