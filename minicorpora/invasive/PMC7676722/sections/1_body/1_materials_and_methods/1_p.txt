0: This study was carried out in Hebei and Liaoning Provinces in the summer (August and September) of 2018 using an ecological line transects method [ 22].
1: Three locations were selected in Hebei, i.e Yangyuan (40 12 749 N, 114 39 920  E), Huailai (40 22 411 N, 115 31 581  E), and Zhangjiakou (40 51 290 N, 114 51 378  E) and one location was selected in Liaoning, i.e., Fushun (41 51 279 N, 123 49 126  E).
2: The precipitation is higher but monthly mean temperatures are lower in Fushun than in Zhangjiakou, Huailai and Yangyuan (S1 Fig in  S1 File).
3: In each location, 10 places were selected (10 replicates per location); and at each place, three pairs of invaded and non-invaded quadrats (100 * 100 cm) were setup (3 replicates per place).
4: The 10 spaces in each location were at least 20 km apart from each other [ 23].
5: In order to diminish potential confounding effects of habitat heterogeneity on comparisons between invaded and non-invaded quadrats (i.e., the effects of the invader), the quadrats with and without  X.  strumarium were less than 2 m apart in each pair, and the quadrats in different pair were spaced at least 5 m [ 23].
6: The non-invaded quadrats were setup at second vegetations, and the invaded quadrats were dominated by  X.  strumarium [ 24].
7: In total, we had 120 pairs of quadrats with and without  X.  strumarium (4 locations  10 places  3 replicates).
8: All plant species were identified and their individuals were counted in all invaded and non-invaded studied quadrats (S1 Table in  S1 File) along with plant species did not found in studied quadrats but also found in four locations (S2 Table in  S1 File).
9: The averages of monthly mean maximum and minimum temperatures (Max.
10: T and Mini.
11: T, respectively), monthly mean precipitation ( PPT/ppt) and monthly mean relative humidity ( RH) was collected from data base of  http://data.cma.cn/data/weatherBK.html (S1 Fig in  S1 File).
