0: Non-metric multidimensional scaling and analysis of similarity were conducted to determine the resemblance of species composition between the invaded and non-invaded quadrats through Bray-Curtis similarity/dissimilarity following log-transformation of plant species abundance data due to zero/no species count in some plots using one way analysis of variance with Global statistics  R through PRIMER 7 programming [ 25].
1: The estimations of global measurement ( R) values vary between +1 and -1; and the bigger of the  R value is (close to 1), the more significant the dissimilarity ( P< 0.01 or 1%) between the invaded and non-invaded quadrats is 0 to 100 with 100 expressing the most extreme dissimilarity [ 10,  26].
2: Similarity percentage method was used to assess contribution of each species to the dissimilarity between the invaded and non-invaded quadrats [ 27].
3: The degree of invasion impact was evaluated using diversity indices including Margalef's Richness Index, Shannon Entropy, Simpsons Diversity Index, Shannons Diversity Index, Species Richness, Species Equitability or Evenness, and Abundance of different plant species between invaded and non-invaded quadrats [ 25,  28].
4: The differences in the diversity indices between the invaded and non-invaded quadrats were determined by analysis of variance with invasion status and locations as a factor in SPSS 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and using Permutation analysis of variance through PRIMER 7 software.
5: The competitive pattern was recorded between plant species within the selected quadrats calculated on the basis of Relative Abundance [ 25,  28 30].
6: The difference in plant species in each location between invaded, non-invaded quadrats and their correlation were calculated individually by paired  t-test through SPSS 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
