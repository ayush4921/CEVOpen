0: Invasive alien species has been recognized cause of biodiversity loss in the world [ 12].
1: X.  strumarium has become a major concern in China, posing severe problems on the rangeland biodiversity, agriculture lands, parks, banks of river, and lakes, dams, roadsides, and even in urban areas, with great economic and ecological consequences.
2: This plant is a severe threat to agriculture field crops such as soybeans, cotton, maize, sunflower and groundnuts in many parts of the world along with China [ 13].
3: It can also invade pastures and grazing lands causing reductions in forage production and fur damage through the thorns on the fruits [ 14].
4: It competes with, or even out-competes native species, decreasing genetic and species diversity within populations and altering ecosystem [ 15].
5: Multivariate analysis for ordination and analysis of similarity showed decreases in biodiversity indices in invaded over control sites, indicating that plant communities become less diverse due to  X.  strumarium invasion [ 16].
6: This plant has imposed negative impacts on ecosystem properties [ 17,  18].
