# VOLUNTEERS 

Volunteering is am important part of Open projects. We welcome volunteers but emphasize that this is a significant commitment. 
Several volunteers have  become valued, faithful contributors; Here are some:
* Ayush Garg 
* Emanuel Faria
* Giulia Arsuffi 
* Clyde Davies and team 
* past interns (especially Ambreen Hamadani and Shweata Hegde)

Volunteers are a common feature of Open projects and there are varied roles:
* testing the system
* adding data
* dictionaries
* documentation and outreach
* diversification of the science (e.g. adding new organisms)
* language and geographic diversity (e.g. documentation, translations)
* outreach
* adding code

Volunteers are NOT a "free resource". Each volunteer incurs a cost: 
* induction
* training
* integration of data and code
* opportunity cost (e.g. holding the project back for a period)
* social management
* failure recovery (i.e. half finished projects)

All of this takes management, time and energy. 

The key aspects of volunteer contributions are usually of two types:
## micro-incremental

i.e. adding one small bit at a time. For example this could be dictionary checking or enhancement, entry by entry.
 Or annotating articles. Something that can be completed in an hour.
## extensions

These are "nice to have" but not currently critical. They include tutorials, documentation, language extensions, 
exploration of displays and analysis (e.g. plotting , machine learning).

# conclusion

*In general new volunteers will not be involved in code or design.* 

A new volunteer:
* should have no core impact if their activity does not work out.
* is expected to have learnt our technology , data, and structure. We cannot provide personal training (normally they have to learn from the existing docs).
* should *have already demonstrated* their ability and commitment (perhaps by building an extension project).
