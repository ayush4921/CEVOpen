 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> culture was maintained according to the method described by Trager and Jensen [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] with slight modifications. 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> Dd2 and 7G8 cultures were maintained in fresh O
 <sup>+ve</sup> human erythrocytes suspended at 4% haematocrit in RPMI 1640 (Sigma Aldrich—France) containing 0.2% sodium bicarbonate, 0.5% Albumax, 45 μg L
 <sup>−1</sup> hypoxanthine and 50 μg L
 <sup>−1</sup> gentamicin, and incubated at 37 °C under a gas mixture 5% O
 <sub>2</sub>, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, and 90% N
 <sub>2</sub>. Every day, infected erythrocytes were transferred into fresh complete medium to propagate the culture.
