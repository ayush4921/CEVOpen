<p id="Par24">Melting points were uncorrected and were measured on a Mettler Toledo instrument. IR spectra were recorded on an Alpha II FT-IR spectrometer from Bruker in the region of 4000–600 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>, using KBr pellet technique with 1.0 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> resolution at room temperature. 1D and 2D NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker DRX 500 (500 MHz for 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 125 MHz for 
 <sup>13</sup>C spectra) spectrometer (Bruker, Rheinstetten, Germany) with chemical shifts reported as δ (ppm), using TMS as an internal standard. The ESI-MS were obtained on LTQ-FT instrument (Thermo Scientific). LC–MS were measured with Shimadzu LC–MS system using a L-column 2 ODS (I.D. 2.1 × 100 mm, Chemical Evaluation and Research Institute, Japan), at a flow rate of 0.2 mL min
