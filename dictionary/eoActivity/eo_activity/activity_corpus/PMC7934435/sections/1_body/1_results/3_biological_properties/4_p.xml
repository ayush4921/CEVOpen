<p id="Par15">From the antimycobacterial tests results (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), it should be noticed that the mixture of FA (A
 <sub>1</sub>) exhibited a good antitubercular activity with a Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) value at 9.52 μg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. According to Cantrell et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], isolated compounds that exhibit a MIC ≤ 64 μg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> are considered promising. For crude extracts, the MIC should be ≤ 125 μg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The extract made known poor inhibitory activity against 
 <italic>M</italic>ycobacterium 
 <italic>tuberculosis</italic>, exhibiting a MIC and a Minimal Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) of 1250 and 2500 μg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> respectively.
