<p id="Par19">UV–visible spectrum of 
 <bold>1</bold> displayed three maxima at λ
 <sub>max</sub> 183, 195 nm (representing the absorption bands of amide and imide functions) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and 265 nm [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Despite on the fact that batesiin (
 <bold>2</bold>) is characterized by the same chromophore groups, its UV–visible spectrum (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) exhibits one major absorption band at λ
 <sub>max</sub> = 296 nm and minor absorptions as shoulder sections (letters A and B) with λ
 <sub>max</sub> around 287 and 304 nm respectively. Simulated UV–visible spectra of 
 <bold>2</bold> were achieved at B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) with chloroform (non-polar aprotic solvent) and ethanol (polar protic solvent) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), based on its tautomeric and ionic forms (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>): all λ
 <sub>max</sub> results (experimental and theoretical) are summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>. Excitation energy (in nm) determined in CHCl
 <sub>3</sub> at 283.89 is closed to experimental value at 287 nm while simulation in EtOH exhibits an energy (in nm) at 315.59 which is comparable to the experimental λ
 <sub>max</sub> at 304 nm. It must also be precised that results of IR calculations were almost similar to previous ones regarding allantoin (
 <bold>1</bold>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], since 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> share the same functional groups; hence, there was no need to report them.
