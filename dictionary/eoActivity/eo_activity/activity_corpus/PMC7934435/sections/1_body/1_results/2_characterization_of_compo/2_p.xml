<p id="Par9">The 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectrum of 
 <bold>2</bold> showed four remarkable signals at 157.4 [C(2), 2C], 173.6 [C(4), 2C], 62.4 [C(5), 2C] and 156.8 [C(7), 1C] ppm; when considering that 
 <bold>2</bold> contains seven carbon atoms, the number of aforementioned signals presume the occurrence of a symmetry. The DEPT 135 NMR spectrum of 
 <bold>2</bold> revealed one signal at δ
 <sub>C</sub> 62.4 [C(5)] ppm indicating one methine group. These observations were confirmed by its HSQC spectrum which indicates a correlation between the proton at δ
 <sub>H</sub> 5.30 ppm [H–C(5)] and the said carbon. Two remaining signals from the 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectrum are observable at δ
 <sub>C</sub> 48.6 and 54.9 ppm and are suggestive of signals of MeOH and CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub> respectively; this assertion is strengthened by correlations between signals at δ
 <sub>C</sub> 48.6 and δ
 <sub>H</sub> 3.17 ppm in one side, and signals at δ
 <sub>C</sub> 54.9 and δ
 <sub>H</sub> 5.74 ppm from the same HSQC spectrum [
