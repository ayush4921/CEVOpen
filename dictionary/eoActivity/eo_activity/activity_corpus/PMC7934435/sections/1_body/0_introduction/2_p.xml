<p id="Par5">The genus 
 <italic>Cordia</italic> (Boraginaceae) is composed of trees or shrubs and is widespread in Central and South America, India, Asia and Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Previous phytochemical investigations of plants from this genus reported the isolation and characterization of different classes of secondary metabolites including naphthoquinones, hydroquinones [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] or polyphenols [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Concurrently and based on some pharmacological surveys, essential oils from 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>curassivica</italic> and 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>gilletii</italic> appeared as active against some microbial strains [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Biological activities and in silico investigations of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>dichotoma</italic> were recently reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]; the plant is also known to contain, apart from allantoin (
 <bold>1</bold>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] which has been the subject of many quantum calculations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], fatty acids (FA) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. FA have been recognized as energy sources for

 <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> bacilli [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. A few 
 <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> bacilli were inhibited by 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>sebestena</italic> extracts as results of biological analyses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Sebestenoid D is a component of the latter species and was a matter of density functional theory (DFT) studies, with its optimized molecular geometry and HOMOâ€“LUMO plot as outcomes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) were also calculated during a survey aiming to check the coherence between experimental and theoretical NMR and IR data; this investigation was done on a compound with an imidazole unit [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] like allantoin (
 <bold>1</bold>). Other simulations completed on a particular range of complex natural products involved IR as well as electronic transitions for UV analyses through time dependent DFT (TD-DFT); findings were afterwards compared to experimental results [
