    "Fungi from the genus Candida are very important human and animal pathogens. Many strains can produce biofilms, which inhibit the activity of antifungal drugs and increase the tolerance or resistance to them as well. Clinically, this process leads to persistent infections and increased mortality. Today, many Candida species are resistant to drugs, including C. auris, which is a multiresistant pathogen. Natural compounds may potentially be used to combat multiresistant and biofilm-forming strains. The aim of this review was to present plant-derived preparations and compounds that inhibit Candida biofilm formation by at least 50%. A total of 29 essential oils and 16 plant extracts demonstrate activity against Candida biofilms, with the following families predominating: Lamiaceae, Myrtaceae, Asteraceae, Fabaceae, and Apiacae. Lavandula dentata (0.045–0.07 mg/L), Satureja macrosiphon (0.06–8 mg/L), and Ziziphora tenuior (2.5 mg/L) have the best antifungal activity. High efficacy has also been observed with Artemisia judaica, Lawsonia inermis, and Thymus vulgaris. Moreover, 69 plant compounds demonstrate activity against Candida biofilms. Activity in concentrations below 16 mg/L was observed with phenolic compounds (thymol, pterostilbene, and eugenol), sesquiterpene derivatives (warburganal, polygodial, and ivalin), chalconoid (lichochalcone A), steroidal saponin (dioscin), flavonoid (baicalein), alkaloids (waltheriones), macrocyclic bisbibenzyl (riccardin D), and cannabinoid (cannabidiol). The above compounds act on biofilm formation and/or mature biofilms. In summary, plant preparations and compounds exhibit anti-biofilm activity against Candida. Given this, they may be a promising alternative to antifungal drugs."
