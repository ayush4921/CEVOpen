<p>The Lamiaceae family includes numerous popular and lesser-known plants with pronounced therapeutic effects. This large botanical family is taxonomically divided into several subfamilies, one of the largest being Nepetoideae, which includes species with pronounced antioxidant properties [
 <xref rid="B4-plants-10-00710" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The genus 
 <italic>Micromeria</italic> Bentham also belonging to this subfamily is represented by about 70 species, 21 of which are distributed in Europe [
 <xref rid="B5-plants-10-00710" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. A number of molecular and morphological studies have shown a close relationship between the genera 
 <italic>Micromeria</italic> (section Pseudomelissa) and 
 <italic>Clinopodium</italic> [

 <italic>Micromeria</italic> to the genus 
 <italic>Clinopodium</italic> [
 <xref rid="B7-plants-10-00710" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Several 
 <italic>Micromeria</italic> species have been reported as antirheumatic, antiseptic, abortifacient, CNS stimulant, and tonic and several polyphenolic compounds have been identified in them [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-10-00710" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Polyphenols reduce inflammatory mediators, leukocyte migration and stabilize endothelial cells, thus being involved in the pathogenesis of vascular disorders [
 <xref rid="B9-plants-10-00710" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Traditionally, members of the genus 
 <italic>Micromeria</italic> are used against heart diseases, respiratory diseases (asthma), headaches, colds, wounds, skin infections, as well as for insecticidal, herbicidal and culinary purposes [
