<p>Medicinal plants contain different substances (i.e., flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins, and terpenoids) that reveal antioxidant and antimicrobial effects. Due to their antimicrobial properties, extracts from various medicinal plants have been widely used for treatment of different diseases. Further, many studies investigated the possible application of plant extracts as natural preservatives. There are several studies on the antiinflammatory and antimicrobial effects of 
 <italic>Micromeria</italic> against some pathogens [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-10-00710" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-plants-10-00710" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-plants-10-00710" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Ali-Shtayeh et al. reported that the antimicrobial activity of different 
 <italic>Micromeria</italic> species’ extracts could be attributed to plant’s phenolic compounds [
 <xref rid="B19-plants-10-00710" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, antimicrobial properties of 
 <italic>Micromeria frivaldszkyana</italic> are barely studied. Phytochemical studies of rare and endemic plants with specific habitats are of scientific interest and thus the assessment of the biological characteristics, distribution and natural resources of the species 
 <italic>Micromeria</italic> is important for their conservation and sustainable use [
 <xref rid="B20-plants-10-00710" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Previous studies report only the 2,2′-diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity of 
 <italic>M. frivaldszkyana</italic> and TLC analysis of the flavonoid profiles of four 
 <italic>Micromeria</italic> species distributed in Bulgaria [
 <xref rid="B12-plants-10-00710" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. More detailed information on phytometabolites and biological activity of 
 <italic>M. frivaldszkyana</italic> is still missing. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to investigate the content and composition of sugars, organic acids and major polyphenols of the Balkan-endemic 
 <italic>Micromeria frivaldszkyana</italic>, and to evaluate its antioxidant and antimicrobial effects.
