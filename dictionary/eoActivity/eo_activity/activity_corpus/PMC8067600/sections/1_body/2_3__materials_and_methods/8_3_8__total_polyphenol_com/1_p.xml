<p>The total polyphenol content was determined spectrophotometrically with the Folin–Ciocalteu’s reagent according to the method of Singleton and Rossi with some modifications [
 <xref rid="B40-plants-10-00710" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Briefly, 0.1 mL of the extracts were mixed with 3.1 mL deionized water and 0.2 mL of Folin–Ciocalteu phenol reagents. After 3 min, 0.6 mL of 20% sodium carbonate was added to the mixture. Samples were incubated for 5 min at 50 °C and their absorbance was measured at 765 nm. Gallic acid was employed as a calibration standard and the results were expressed as mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE) per 100 g DW.
