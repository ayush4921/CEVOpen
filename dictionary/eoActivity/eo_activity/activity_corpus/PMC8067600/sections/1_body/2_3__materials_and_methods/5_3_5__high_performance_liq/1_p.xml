<p>HPLC determination of sugars was performed according to Denev et al. on HPLC system Agilent 1220 (Agilent Technology, Santa Clara, CA, USA), with a binary pump and Refractive Index Detector (Agilent Technology, USA) [
 <xref rid="B39-plants-10-00710" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The column was Zorbax Carbohydrate (150 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm, Agilent), connected to a guard column Zorbax Reliance Cartridge (Agilent), and as eluent was used 80% acetonitrile in water at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min and temperature 25 °C. Results were calculated with standards curves for each analytical standard (fructose, glucose, galactose, sorbitol, rhamnose, xylose, arabinose, sucrose and melibiose) and expressed as mg/100 g dry weight (DW) [
