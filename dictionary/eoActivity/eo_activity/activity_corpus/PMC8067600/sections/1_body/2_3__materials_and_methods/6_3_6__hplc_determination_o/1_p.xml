<p>HPLC determination of organic acids was performed according to Denev et al. on HPLC system Agilent 1220 (Agilent Technology, USA), with binary pump and UV-Vis detector (Agilent Technology, USA) [
 <xref rid="B39-plants-10-00710" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Organic acid separation was performed on Agilent TC-C18 column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) at 25 °C and the eluate was monitored at 210 nm. The mobile phase was 25 mM phosphate (K

Results were calculated with standards curves for each analytical standard (quinic acid, malic acid, ascorbic acid, citric acid, α-ketoglutaric acid, succinic acid, oxalic acid, formic acid, shikimic acid and tartaric acid) and expressed as mg/100 g DW.
