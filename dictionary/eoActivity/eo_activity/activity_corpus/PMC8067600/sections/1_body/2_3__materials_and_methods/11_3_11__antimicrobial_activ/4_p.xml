<p>Agar serial tube dilution is the most commonly used method to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). Experiments were conducted with undiluted and diluted (10- and 100-fold) plant extract in order to determine MICs. Paper discs soaked in distilled water were used as controls. The results were expressed as diameters of the clear zones around the paper discs, in millimeters, after 24â€“48 h of incubation at optimal temperature for the growth of the corresponding test-microorganism [
