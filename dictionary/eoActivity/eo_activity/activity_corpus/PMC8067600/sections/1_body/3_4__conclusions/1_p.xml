<p>The antioxidant antimicrobial activity of the rare endemic species 
 <italic>M. frivaldszkyana</italic> (Degen) Velen. was studied for the first time. The amounts of total flavonoids, polyphenols, phenolic acids, organic acids and sugars in the plant were analyzed, as well. The study shows that 
 <italic>M. frivaldszkyana</italic> is a good source of natural antioxidants and particularly rosmarinic acid, and it would be of interest of cultivating this rare endemic plant due to its limited area and inaccessible distribution. In vivo work is needed to utilize and assess the antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of this rare endemic.
