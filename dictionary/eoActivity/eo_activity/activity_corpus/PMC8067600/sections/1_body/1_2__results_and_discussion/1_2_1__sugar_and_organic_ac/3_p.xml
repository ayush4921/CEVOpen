<p>Studies on the chemical composition of the Bulgarian-endemic plant 
 <italic>M. frivaldszkyana</italic> are very scarce. However, there are a few studies on related species from the same family [

 <xref rid="B22-plants-10-00710" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. To our knowledge, we report for the first time the content and composition of sugars and organic acids from 
 <italic>M. frivaldszkyana</italic> aerial parts. The metabolism of organic acids is essential at the cellular level for several biochemical pathways, including energy production and the formation of precursors for amino acid biosynthesis, in the plantâ€™s adaptation to the environment. The total content of organic acids in plant tissues is higher than in other organisms. The composition of the organic acids that accumulate varies depending on the type and age of the plant and the type of tissue. The high level of organic acids in plant tissues is most likely due to their important role as photosynthetic intermediates. However, organic acids have a potential role as metabolically active solutes for the osmotic adjustment and the balance of cation excess [
