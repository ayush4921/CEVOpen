<p>Antimicrobial tests of 
 <italic>M. frivaldszkyana</italic> against nine microorganisms were carried out by disc diffusion assay and determination of minimal inhibitory concentration (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00710-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Antibiotics penicillin and nystatin were used as positive controls and inhibition zone above 7 mm was considered as a positive result. The extract of 
 <italic>M. frivaldszkyana</italic> demonstrated no antimicrobial activity against most of the tested microorganisms. Only the Gram-positive bacteria—
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> ATCC 19111 was sensitive to the tested 
 <italic>M. frivaldszkyana</italic> extract (inhibition zone (IZ), 9 mm and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), 10 mg/mL). To the best of our knowledge, there is no published data for the antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>M. frivaldszkyana</italic> extract against 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, which is one of the most virulent foodborne microorganisms, also acting as a saprophyte or a pathogen, depending on the environment. Nystatin exhibited strong inhibitory effect against all fungi, but penicillin just to 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC 25923 and 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> ATCC 19111. There are only a few data about the antimicrobial effect of 
 <italic>Micromeria</italic> species. The leaf extract has been used to treat fever, chest pain, skin infections and gastrointestinal symptoms like stomach pain [

 <italic>Micromeria</italic> spp. (
 <italic>M. graeca</italic> autc. Non L., 
 <italic>M. fruticosa</italic> (L.) Druce) are well known to contain essential oil and flavonoids [
 <xref rid="B36-plants-10-00710" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Brahmi et al. observed antibacterial activity of the 
 <italic>Micromeria</italic> extract against four pathogenic bacteria, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> ATCC 25922, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> ATCC 9027, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 6538, and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> 100459, the extracts were inactive against all test-microorganisms (MIC ˃ 2000 μg/mL) [
 <xref rid="B18-plants-10-00710" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Ali-Shtayeh et al. reported that the freeze-dried water extract of 
 <italic>M. nervosa</italic> (Desf.) Benth. (origin, Palestine) indicated lowest activity [
 <xref rid="B19-plants-10-00710" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. According to Brahmi et al. nonpolar extracts from plants have been shown more effective antibacterial properties than polar extracts [
 <xref rid="B18-plants-10-00710" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Despite the high polyphenol and flavonoid content (26,570.5 ± 291.3 mg/100 g DW and 1564 mg/100 g DW, respectively) of the used extract, we detected antimicrobial activity against only one foodborne pathogen. This is most probably due to the phenolic profile of the used extracts, since it is known that the antimicrobial properties of different classes’ polyphenolic compounds varies significantly [
