<p>There are many papers attempting to rank the antioxidant properties of plant materials using different methods, and for better assessment of antioxidant properties several methods should be used [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-10-00710" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Therefore, to evaluate antioxidant activities of investigated ethanol extracts, their abilities to scavenge DPPH and 2,2′azinobis (3)-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) radicals, their power to reduce ferric (FRAP) and cupric (CUPRAC) ions, their ability to neutralize peroxyl radicals (Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity—ORAC), as well as the complexing ability of an antioxidant under Fenton reaction conditions (Hydroxyl Radical Averting Capacity—HORAC) were investigated (

 <italic>M. frivaldszkyana</italic> aerial parts are a rich source of phenolic compounds (9004 ± 129.8), including flavonoids (594.2 ± 3.6). This renders high antioxidant activity, measured via different assays. The antioxidant activity of the plant was as follows: DPPH—286.4 ± 10.43 mM TE/g, ABTS—358.4 ± 10.4 mM TE/g, FRAP—388.0 ± 32.4 mM TE/g, CUPRAC—905.6 ± 19.2 mM TE/g, ORAC—3250.5 ± 208.1 µmol TE/g and HORAC—306.1 ± 23.5 µmol GAE/g. Interestingly, ORAC value of 
 <italic>M. frivaldszkyana</italic> is higher than many other Bulgarian medicinal plants [

They can neutralize free radicals by releasing an electron or a hydrogen atom. Polyphenols inhibit the formation of free radicals by reducing the rate of oxidation by inhibiting the formation or deactivation of ROS [
