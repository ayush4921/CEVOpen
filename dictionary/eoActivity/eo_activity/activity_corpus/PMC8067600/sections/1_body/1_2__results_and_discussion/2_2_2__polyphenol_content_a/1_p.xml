 <xref rid="plants-10-00710-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> presents data on the content of major phenolic components in 
 <italic>M. frivaldszkyana</italic> aerial parts. Unlike other plants, 
 <italic>M. frivaldszkyana</italic> shows very high content of rosmarinic acid, and from the individual phenolic compounds, it was found in the most significant amounts (2040.1 ± 15.76 mg/100 g). In plants, rosmarinic acid is considered a cumulative protective compound, while in humans it has many biological activities, including antiviral, antibacterial, antioxidant, antimutagenic and anti-inflammatory [
 <xref rid="B24-plants-10-00710" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Many in vitro and in vivo studies have reported the antiinflammatory effects of rosmarinic acid in inflammatory diseases [
 <xref rid="B25-plants-10-00710" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In their study, Al-Hamwi et al. also observed the presence of chlorogenic acid (1.123 mg/g) and ferulic acid (0.05 mg/g) in ethanolic extracts of 
 <italic>M. fruticosa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B26-plants-10-00710" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Other studies indicate the presence of chlorogenic acid (7.409 mg/g) and ferulic acid (0.597 mg/g) in ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>M. barbata</italic> [
 <xref rid="B27-plants-10-00710" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The presence of quercetin, rutin, naringin, chlorogenic acid and rosmarinic acid has also been found in methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>M. frivaldszkyana</italic> by thin layer chromatography [
 <xref rid="B28-plants-10-00710" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In a qualitative study of four species of 
 <italic>Micromeria</italic> apigenin, luteolin and their derivatives were found in acetone extract of 
 <italic>M. cristata</italic> and 
 <italic>M. juliana</italic>, whereas chlorogenic acid was detected in methanol extracts of 
 <italic>M. dalmatica</italic> and 
 <italic>M. frivaldszkyana</italic> [
 <xref rid="B12-plants-10-00710" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Chlorogenic and rosmarinic acids were detected in ethanol extracts of three 
 <italic>Micromeria</italic> species of—
 <italic>M. croatica, M. juliana</italic> and 
 <italic>M. thymifolia</italic> by Vladimir-Knežević et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-plants-10-00710" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Phenolics are among the most common secondary plant metabolites, being synthesized to protect plants against various environmental conditions such as drought, UV radiation, pests or physical injury [
 <xref rid="B30-plants-10-00710" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Several flavonoids (epicatechin, hesperidin, quercetin, kaempherol and apigenin) in 
 <italic>M. frivaldszkyana</italic>, and hesperidin was the major representative with content of 131.2 ± 5.6 mg/100 g DW. Flavonoids, as one the largest groups of plant phenolics, are found in many lower and higher plant species [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-10-00710" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Many studies reveal that flavonoids have valuable medicinal properties, which determines the great research interest in this group of biologically active substances.
