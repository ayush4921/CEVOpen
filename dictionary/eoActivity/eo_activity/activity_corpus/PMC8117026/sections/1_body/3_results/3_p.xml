<p id="p0150">Based on this investigation, it seems that mycorrhiza's application with other bioinoculants (
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic>) did have much constructive effect on AM spore number and mycorrhizal root colonization. Maximum increment in percent mycorrhizal root colonization was observed in the consortium treatment, i.e., 
 <italic>G. mosseae</italic>, 
 <italic>A. laevis</italic> and 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> (98.41 ± 1.14) followed by the combination 
 <italic>G. mosseae</italic> + 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> (74.51 ± 3.83). AM spores’ number being highest in mycorrhizospheric plants treated with 
 <italic>G. mosseae</italic> + 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> (174.38 ± 3.16) followed by a mixture of 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>mosseae</italic> + 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> (157.42 ± 2.92). AM root colonization and AM spores were not observed in 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>fluorescens</italic> and control treatments
