<p id="p0145">It is evident from 
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> that inoculated or treated plants showed a significant increase in growth compared to the control. Data on change in plant height was substantial in all the treated plants, and maximum plant height was observed in the mixed consortium of 
 <italic>G. mosseae</italic> + 
 <italic>A. laevis</italic> + 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> (102.18 ± 2.56) followed by dual inoculation of 
 <italic>G. mosseae</italic> + 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> (97.13 ± 2.13) treated plants, which was far better than the uninoculated control plants (50.24 ± 3.88). Maximum root length increment was also observed in the consortium of 
 <italic>G. mosseae</italic> + 
 <italic>A. laevis</italic> + 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> (13.03 ± 0.27) and least in control (6.11 ± 0.27). It is evident from 
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> that dry weight of all the inoculated Sesame plants were found to be significant in terms of shoot and root. It was found that supreme increment in shoot dry weight was recorded in the combination of 
 <italic>G. mosseae</italic> + 
 <italic>A. laevis</italic> + 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> (1.58 ± 0.63) followed by 
 <italic>G. mosseae</italic> + 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> (1.25 ± 0.53) (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Similarly, the increase in root dry weight was also observed to be maximum with 
 <italic>G. mosseae</italic> + 
 <italic>A. laevis</italic> + 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> (0.47 ± 0.34) followed by 
 <italic>G. mosseae</italic> + 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> (0.51 ± 0.43) (
