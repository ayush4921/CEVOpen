<p id="p0155">It is apparent from 
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> that percent of seed protein and oil content varied among different treatments. Maximum protein and oil content was recorded in the consortium of 
 <italic>G. mosseae</italic> + 
 <italic>A. laevis</italic> + 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> (Protein: 21.08 ± 0.87; Oil: 46.30 ± 0.64) followed by 
 <italic>G. mosseae</italic> + 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> (Protein: 19.67 ± 0.64; Oil: 43.95 ± 0.95) as compared to control (Protein: 17.11 ± 0.68; Oil: 38.58 ± 0.33). Data in 
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> revealed that P, Mg, K, Ca, Fe, and Zn uptake was significantly affected by AM fungi and 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> in seeds. The highest value of P was recorded in 
 <italic>G. mosseae</italic> + 
 <italic>A. laevis</italic> + 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> (1.33 ± 0.79), followed by 
 <italic>G. mosseae</italic> + 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> (1.19 ± 0.77) over control (0.65 ± 0.56). Likewise, other nutrients were also found maximum in the same consortium treatment (K: 7.91 ± 0.65; Ca: 1.88 ± 0.71; Mg: 1.81 ± 0.54; Fe: 16.51 ± 0.39; Z: 12.11 ± 0.77) as compared to control one (K: 5.88 ± 0.73; Ca: 0.87 ± 0.58; Mg: 0.86 ± 0.55; Fe: 13.02 ± 0.34; Z: 9.39 ± 0.45).
