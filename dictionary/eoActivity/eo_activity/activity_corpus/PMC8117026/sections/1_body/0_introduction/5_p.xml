<p id="p0020">Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF) are obligate symbiont that is thought to be largely promiscuously, colonizing more than 95% of vascular plants (
 <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">Graham et al. 2017</xref>). AM fungi have a mutual relationship between plants receiving carbon source (lipid + carbohydrate) from the plants and contribute an adequate amount of water and minerals to the plants (
 <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. 2018</xref>). During colonization, AMF produces lipo-chito-oligosaccharides perceived by the plant roots through their signalling molecules (strigolactones and cutin monomers) that activate a typical symbiosis signalling cascade (

 <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">Konieczny and Kowalska, 2017</xref>). AMF interaction improves nutritional status, manages the soil microenvironment, restores degraded land, and reduces nutrient leaching (
 <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">Cavagnaro et al. 2015</xref>). PSB (
 <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic>), on the hand, help AMF and vice versa. However, agriculture soil receives a large number of fertilizers, mainly NPK and lacks an excellent nutrient retention system, but AMF/PSB inoculation can manage soil nutrient recycling. (
 <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">Cavagnaro et al. 2015</xref>). Application of AMF and PSB benefit crop development by enhancing plant health and yield (
 <xref rid="b0220" ref-type="bibr">Rouphael et al. 2015</xref>). AMF and PSB's main role is absorbing and translocating mineral nutrients (particularly P) beyond the depletion zone and induce nutraceutical values as well as interfere with the plant growth hormones, thereby influencing better growth along with inducing tolerance to various environmental stresses (
 <xref rid="b0220" ref-type="bibr">Rouphael et al. 2015</xref>). PSB and AMF activate the plant’s defense mechanism against pathogen attack (called systemic acquired resistance), which is very well documented (

 <italic>fluorescens</italic> is gram-negative, rod-shaped PGPR that colonize plant roots by secreting greenish fluorescent pigment (hence named) particularly under iron scarcity (
