 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>Â spp. and AMF are important microbial bioinoculants that have been shown to promote plant growth, yield and protect plants from pathogens and insects. These inocula help plants to attain healthy growth and high yield, even under stress condition. AMF and PSB can stimulate strigolactones which are iron-chelating agent important for plant growth hormones. It is very well acknowledged that AMF and PSB facilitates nutrient accumulation and is also found in the experiment. Future work will address that by application of bioinoculants, the use of synthetic fertilizers can be minimized with a view to maximize the yield. Overall, the amalgamation of AMF and PSB is the best treatment for attaining better growth and increased water and mineral absorption. Several essential components of the cellular and metabolic processes are maintained by minerals. Sesame biofortification using AMF would be a long-safe way to win over mineral deficiency and fight hidden hunger.
