<p id="p0120">The sesame seed oil estimation was done by petroleum ether using the Soxhlet’s procedure (
 <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">AOCS, 1997</xref>) with a boiling range between 400 and 600°C. 300 ml of normal Hexane was taken, and 10 g of the test was positioned in the thimble and placed in the extractor's centre. The Soxhlet was warmed up at 60oC. If the solvent was boiling, the vapour increases from the vertical tube to the pinnacle's condenser. The extract seeps through the thimble's skin pores and fills the siphon tube, wherever it flows back down into the round outsole flask. This was permitted to carry on for thirty minutes. It was then taken from the hose, dried out in the oven, cooled in the desiccators, and weighed once again to identify the quantity of oil extracted. After the removal, the ensuing combination (miscella) that contains the oil was warmed up to recuperate solvent in the engine oil. 5 replicates of every treatment were taken.
