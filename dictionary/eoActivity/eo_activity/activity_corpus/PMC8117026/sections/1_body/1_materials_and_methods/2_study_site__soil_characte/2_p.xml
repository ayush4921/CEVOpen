<p id="p0030">Experiment was designed under a controlled temperature of 22 ± 2 °C, 16-h photoperiod light of 8000 lx (in addition to natural sunlight) and 65–70% humid condition in polyhouse of Botany Department, Kurukshetra University, Kurukshetra, during 2018–2019. Soil, taken from the Botanical garden of Kurukshetra University, was first air-dried, sieved through 2 mm sieve, autoclaved to eliminate previous microbial strains, and then mixed with sand in 1:3. Soil pH was 7.5 measured by pH meter (PHS-3C, Shanghai Lida Instrument Factory). Other characters of soil are as follows- sand: 71.05%, clay: 5.24%, silt 3.65%, Ca: 0.76%, K: 4.97: Mg: 0.81%, P: 0.57%, Fe: 12.95%, Zn: 8.77% (

The seeds of Sesame variety RT46 were procured from Oil Seed Section of CCS Haryana Agricultural University, Hisar, Haryana 125,004 (India). This variety was chosen because of its cultivation at an extensive scale and its nutritional profile and disease resistance. Later were cleaned with 0.5% (v/v) sodium hypochlorite for 10 min, after washing with water were sown in each pot.
