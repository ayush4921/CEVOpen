 <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">Bradford's (1976)</xref> method using Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 dye. 100 mg of sample was warmed with 10 ml 80% ethanol on a water bath for 2–5 min and allowed to cool down at room temperature. After this, the mixture was homogenized with the same ethanol in pestle and mortar, centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min. After discarding the supernatant, the residue was re-extracted with 5 ml of 1 N NaOH and dissolved by keeping in the water at a temperature of 40–50 °C for 20–30 min. After 30 min, it was centrifuged again at 5000 rpm for 20–30 min, and the absorbance was recorded at 595 nm using a UV–vis spectrophotometer (Specord-205 Analytic Jena, Germany).
