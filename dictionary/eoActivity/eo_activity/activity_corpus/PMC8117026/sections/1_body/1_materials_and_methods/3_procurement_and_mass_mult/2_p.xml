<p id="p0040">Inoculum of 
 <italic>Glomus mosseae</italic> containing 75–78% colonization (root pieces) plus 670–690 AM spores (w/w) and 
 <italic>Acaulospora laevis</italic> containing 68–71% colonization (root pieces) plus 550–570 AM spores (w/w) were procured from Forest Pathology Discipline, Forest Protection Division, FRI, Dehradun. Both inoculums were then mass multiplied using Barley (host) for almost 3 months (as AMF generally take 80–90 days for infection and full colonization) to develop the starter inocula for the experiment (

 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>mosseae</italic> with 72–74% colonization/infection (barley root pieces) plus 620–640 spores (w/w) and 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>laevis</italic> with 64–67% colonization/infection (barley root pieces) plus 540–560 (w/w) [quantified by gridline intersect method by Adholeya and Gaur (1994); estimation of root colonization percentage was done by Philips and Hayman (1970)]. 
 <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> (ATCC-17400) was obtained from the CSIR-Institute of Microbial Technology (CSIR-IMtech), Chandigarh, India. It was then multiplied in a nutrient broth medium containing beef extract: 3 g/L; peptone: 5 g/L, and NaCl: 5 g/L, respectively to develop the bacterial colonies. The medium was then incubated at 32 °C for 48 h for proper bacteria growth.
