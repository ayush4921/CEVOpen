 <p>Sesame (
  <italic>Sesamum indicum</italic> L.) is an important staple crop of the family Pedaliaceae. The commercial production of sesame is still dependent on the applications of chemical fertilizers. Mycorrhiza inoculum resulted in better morphological and biochemical traits in vegetables. Thus, here the outcome of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and 
  <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescence</italic> (ATCC-17400) inoculation was studied in the pot culture experiment. Primarily, there seems to be a promising opportunity of AMF in sesame under pot and field trials because of enhanced morphological parameters, especially root weight, and disparities in nutrients and metabolites. The AMF appears to be an option to boost plant growth, mineral content, and sesame yield. The AMF treatment with 
  <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescence</italic> strain (ATCC-17400) determined the maximum values for the morphological traits and mineral content. Overall, our study highlights mycorrhizal fungi and other microbes efficacy in achieving a successful sesame production.
