<p>Coronaviruses (CoV) (family: 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic>) are enveloped viruses containing non‐segmented, positive‐stranded genomic RNA. These viruses are pleomorphic particles ranging from 80–220 nm in diameter. The genome size of coronaviruses ranges from 26–32 kilobases (MacLachlan &amp; Dubovi, 
 <xref rid="ptr7019-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). It has better genome sequence vis‐à‐vis to the SARS‐CoV compared to MERS‐CoV, but the amino acid sequence is different from the other coronavirus, especially in the region of 1ab polyprotein and S‐protein or surface glycoprotein (Kannan, Ali, Sheeza, &amp; Hemalatha, 
 <xref rid="ptr7019-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Their entire replication cycle takes place in the cytoplasm. Coronaviruses can cause several of diseases, including bronchitis, hepatitis, gastroenteritis, and even death in birds, humans, and other animals (Chafekar &amp; Fielding,

The coronavirus has been found to attack all types of people, especially elderly patients having diabetes, hypertension, cerebral infarction, chronic bronchitis, Parkinson's disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, and cancer (Deng &amp; Peng,

 <xref rid="ptr7019-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Coronaviruses (CoVs) enter into the host cell through interaction between the S protein of the virus species and the receptor of the host cell. It will bind with the angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 receptor from the host cell to create a suitable habitation for viral replication (Walls et al.,
