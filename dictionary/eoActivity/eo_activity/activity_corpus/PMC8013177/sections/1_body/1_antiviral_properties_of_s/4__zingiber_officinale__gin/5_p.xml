<p>Ahkam et al. (
 <xref rid="ptr7019-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>) studied the potential of a few bioactive compounds, namely, gingerenone A, gingerol, geraniol, shogaol, zingiberene, zingiberenol, and zingerone from Ginger as anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 for their interaction to spike and main protease (Mpro) protein based on molecular docking study. They found that the bioactive compounds of ginger block the spike (S) protein from binding to the ACE2 receptor or act as an inhibitor for MPro. The S protein is responsible for SARS‐CoV‐2 entry during the infection which binds with angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor from the host cell to generate an appropriate environment for viral replication (Walls et al.,
