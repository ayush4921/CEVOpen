<p>Pruthvish and Gopinatha (

 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>cordifolia</italic> showed antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus which was evaluated by MTT assay. Chowdhury (
 <xref rid="ptr7019-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>) evaluated the five phytoconstituents of 
 <italic>T. cordifolia</italic> (giloy), namely, berberine, b‐sitosterol, coline, tetrahydropalmatine, and octacosanol using molecular dynamics approach. She found that berberine can regulate 3CLpro protein's function by inhibition and subsequently control viral replication. Tinocordiside, one of the phytochemicals of giloy, showed inhibition of main protease of SARS‐CoV‐2 in a molecular docking study (Shree et al., 
 <xref rid="ptr7019-bib-0097" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Berberine, Isocolumbin, Magnoflorine, and Tinocordiside compounds isolated from Giloy showed high binding efficacy against all the four key SARS‐CoV‐2 target surface glycoprotein (6VSB), receptor‐binding domain (6M0J), RNA dependent RNA polymerase (6M71), and main protease (6Y84) involved in virus attachment and replication (Sagar &amp; Kumar,
