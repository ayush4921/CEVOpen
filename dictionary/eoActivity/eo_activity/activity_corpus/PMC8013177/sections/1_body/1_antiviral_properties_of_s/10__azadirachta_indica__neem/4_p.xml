<p>Due to its already proven antiviral properties and effectiveness, many scientists have started research on neem for discovering drugs against SARS‐COV‐2. Natural bioactive compounds, namely, methyl eugenol, oleanolic acid, and ursolic acid extracted from tulsi and neem act as inhibitors against SARS‐CoV‐2. These bioactive compounds function as effective inhibitors of SARS‐CoV‐2 by binding to the spike glycoprotein, RNA polymerase, and/or its protease which results in the prevention of both viral attachment and replication (Kumar, 
 <xref rid="ptr7019-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Approximately 20 compounds isolated from neem leaves extract showed high binding affinity against COVID‐19 main protease protein which is the key protein for viral replication (Subramanian,
