<p>Antiviral activity of curcumin was observed against different viruses including hepatitis viruses, SARS coronavirus, influenza viruses, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), herpes simplex virus, dengue virus, chikungunya virus, and so on, as listed in Table 
 <xref rid="ptr7019-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Curcumin's antiviral activities can also be evidenced by its ability to regulate various molecular targets that contribute to various cellular events, such as transcription regulation, and the activation of cellular signaling pathways (Joe, Vijaykumar, &amp; Lokesh, 
 <xref rid="ptr7019-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). Curcumin's role in targeting various cellular pathways, further inhibiting the growth, and replication of viruses makes it an ideal candidate as an anti‐viral drug. Utomo, Ikawati, and Meiyanto (
 <xref rid="ptr7019-bib-0109" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>), based on their molecular docking study, reported that the curcumin binds and inhibits the target receptors including SARS‐CoV‐2 protease, spike glycoprotein‐RBD, and PD‐ACE2, which are involved in virus infection.
