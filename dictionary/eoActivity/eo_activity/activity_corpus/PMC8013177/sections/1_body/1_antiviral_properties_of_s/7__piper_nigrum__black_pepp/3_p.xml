<p>Priya and Saravana (
 <xref rid="ptr7019-bib-0079" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) evaluated the antiviral activity of 
 <italic>Piper nigrum</italic>in chloroform and methanolic extracts against vesicular stomatitis virus (an enteric virus) and human parainfluenza virus on human cell lines. They found that the anti‐viral activity of 
 <italic>Piper nigrum</italic> is higher in chloroform extract due to the presence of higher content ofalkaloids. According to molecular docking based study, it has been found that piperine could inhibit methyltransferase of Dengue virus and VP35 interferon inhibitory domain of Ebola virus comparative to commercial antiviral Ribavirin (Nag &amp; Chowdhury,

 <xref rid="ptr7019-bib-0081" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>) in a docking based study reported that the bioactive compounds from black pepper such as piperdardiine and piperanine are considerably active against COVID‐19, which can be further used for its treatment.
