<p>In the current pandemic scenario, precautions and boosting immunity are one of the best choices to get away from COVID‐19 infection. As per our study, we conclude that the uses of spices and herbs may play a significant role against viral infections. We have analyzed that cinnamon, black pepper, basil, and turmeric play a vital role against SARS‐CoV‐2 (COVID‐19) as well as other viral infections, which was also supported by some other recent studies. In India, people are using spices as well as herbs from ancient times due to their taste, antiviral, antimicrobial, antioxidant, and immunity‐boosting properties. Since ages Indians are habitual of taking these natural products that have conferred immunity in the Indian population, which probably is the major cause for low mortality in India. However, the excessive use of spices and herbs may cause various side effects, namely, acidity in the stomach, heartburn, constipation, diarrhea ulcers in the mouth, high blood pressure, and so on. Therefore, detailed studies about the bioactive compounds present in common Indian herb and spices and their effectiveness and mode of action against lethal viruses need to be explored.</p>
