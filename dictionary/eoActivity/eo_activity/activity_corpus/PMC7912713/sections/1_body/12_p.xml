<p>The work by Ngnameko et al., likewise covers the possibility offered by natural sources for the identification of bioactive molecules by reporting on the medicinal properties of 
 <italic>Spathodea campanulata</italic> P. Beauv. (Bignoniaceae) [
 <xref rid="B8-antibiotics-10-00141" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The work shows preliminary evidence on the ability of the crude plant extract to inhibit 
 <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> growth by urease inhibition and modulation of virulence factors. Fractions and subfractions of the plant crude extract were characterized by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLCâ€“HRMS). Kaempferol, a flavonol, was identified as a promising compound. Further investigations are ongoing to confirm the capacity of this new hit to modulate 
 <italic>H. pylori</italic> virulence factors.
