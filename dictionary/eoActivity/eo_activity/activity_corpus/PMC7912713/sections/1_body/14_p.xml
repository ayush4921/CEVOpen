<p>Gianquinto and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B10-antibiotics-10-00141" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] propose a review of β-lactamase (BL), the bacterial enzymes representing a major resistance mechanism to β-lactam antibiotics in Gram-negative bacteria. The interest in discovering novel BL inhibitors is high as the more newly emerged BLs are not inhibited by the available inhibitors. Moreover, the insurgence rate of effective mutations is far higher than the discovery of new inhibitors able to counteract them, slowing down the approval of new BL inhibitors in therapy. In relation to this, the authors discuss a strategy to target allosteric sites in BLs, thus overcoming the frequent occurrence of mutations and the difficulty of competing efficaciously with substrates. Allosteric inhibitors could work synergistically with traditional inhibitors, increasing the chances of restoring bacterial susceptibility toward available antibiotics.
