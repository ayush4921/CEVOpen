<p>The research article by Reidl et al. deals with 
 <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-6-sulfonamide indoline derivatives as inhibitors of DapE [
 <xref rid="B4-antibiotics-10-00141" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This bacterial enzyme, which is indispensable for bacterial survival and pathogenesis but absent in humans, has been recently validated as a promising bacterial target for the design of antibiotics with a new mechanism of action. For a series of prepared derivatives, molecular docking predictions suggested a mechanism of action based on a specific interaction within the DapE ZN (II) binding site. This study can represent a starting point for the drug design of small, drug-like DapE inhibitors as potential, highly selective antibiotics.
