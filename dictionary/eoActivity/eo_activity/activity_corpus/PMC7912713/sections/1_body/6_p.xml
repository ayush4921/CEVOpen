<p>Antimicrobial resistance among 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> was investigated by Kavaliauskas and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B3-antibiotics-10-00141" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The authors discuss a series of 5-nitro-2-thiophenecarbaldehyde derivatives. As such, for the most active molecule, the in silico structure-based pharmacological properties and toxicity were predicted. In biological assays, the compound significantly impaired the 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilm integrity, demonstrating good antibacterial activity against multidrug-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. The results obtained suggest the therapeutic potential of the identified lead as a vancomycin-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (VRSA)-targeting antimicrobial agent.
