<p>Among the contributed reviews, Panchal et al. propose a complete review of riboswitches (RB) and lead compounds that have been identified so far against various riboswitches via fragment screening, high-throughput screening, and structure-based design [
 <xref rid="B9-antibiotics-10-00141" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The authors discuss the current status of research in the field and the potential offered by RB. Their ability to regulate genes, specifically those involved in the biosynthesis of essential metabolites in pathogenic bacteria, de facto render them a potent and druggable antibacterial target for the development of antibiotics with a new mechanism of action. The authors highlight challenges in the identification of novel active compounds, in particular the lack of specific high-throughput screening methods and the risk of hitting off-targets with nonselective molecules.
