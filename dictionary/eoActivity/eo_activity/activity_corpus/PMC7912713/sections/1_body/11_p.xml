<p>Besides their contribution to the anticapsular and antifungal activity of α-cyperone, Horn et al. focus their attention on novel drugs to fight virulence and resistance in fungal pathogens [
 <xref rid="B7-antibiotics-10-00141" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The authors screened a collection of medicinal plant sources looking for antifungal activity, thus identifying an active fraction from the rhizome of 
 <italic>Cyperus rotundus</italic>, the nut grass plant. The essential oil α-Cyperone demonstrated fungicidal activity against different species of 
 <italic>Candida</italic>. Moreover, when combined with a clinical antifungal drug, fluconazole, the minimal inhibitory concentration of α-Cyperone was reduced. Further work needs to be carried out at the mechanistic level to fully validate α-Cyperone as a novel, synergistic antifungal agent.
