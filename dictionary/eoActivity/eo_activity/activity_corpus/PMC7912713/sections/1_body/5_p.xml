<p>In their contribution, Hennessen and coworkers discuss the ability of amidochelocardin, a biosynthetic derivative of the bioactive NP chelocardin, to overcome known bacterial resistance mechanisms [
 <xref rid="B2-antibiotics-10-00141" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Amidochelocardin acts as a broad-spectrum antibacterial that is active against the ESKAPE group of clinically relevant bacteria. The ability of this atypical tetracycline to escape common resistance mechanisms, i.e., efflux processes, was investigated and validated against a large panel of multidrug-resistant (MDR) uropathogenic clinical isolates. The molecule represents a promising candidate to be developed into future therapeutics.
