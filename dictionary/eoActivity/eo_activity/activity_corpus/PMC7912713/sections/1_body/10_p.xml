<p>Moving to the design of agents active in tuberculosis (TB) infection, Venugopala et al. explore the functionalization of the triazole nucleus and its impact on anti-TB activity [
 <xref rid="B6-antibiotics-10-00141" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Selected derivatives were validated against H37Rv and MDR strains of 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (MTB). Molecular docking and molecular dynamic (MD) simulation conducted for the most promising compounds identified Î²-ketoacyl ACP synthase I (KasA) as the potential cellular target of the detected anti-TB activity. The results can support further hit-to-lead development of triazolyl anti-TB agents with improved potency and selectivity.
