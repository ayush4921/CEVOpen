<p id="Par34">Unsustainable harvesting of NTFPs, mostly medicinal and edible plants, is the major threat to the conservation and management of NTFPs in Himachal Pradesh. Listed NTFPs of the state reveals that 125 medicinal plant species are facing various categories of a threat as per IUCN criteria and local perception. At least four species are identified as “critically endangered,” another four as “near threatened,” nine species as “endangered,” 3 species as “vulnerable,” and 46 species as least concern. According to various stakeholders, as many as 105 species are considered threatened (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The most common threatened species are 
 <italic>Aconitum heterophyllum</italic>, 
 <italic>Angelica glauca</italic>, 
 <italic>Gentiana kurroo</italic>, 
 <italic>Nardostachys jatamansi</italic>, 
 <italic>Saussurea costus</italic>, 
 <italic>Lilium polyphyllum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Thalictrum foliolosum</italic>. The major concern is over-harvesting due to trade pressure. In addition, habitat destruction, livestock grazing, forest fires, etc. are also responsible for the depletion of many species. Conservation and cultivation of Himalayan medicinal plants is a key priority in the Indian Himalayan region [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Wild populations of many species have recently declined due to continued habitat destruction and over-exploitation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>].. Depending on the plant part harvested, lack of management may also result in overexploitation, diminished vigor of populations, and economic exhaustion of the resource [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Many significant NTFPs are on the verge of becoming endangered due to the large quantum of collection from the wild, non-availability of any baseline data about their harvesting potential, non-availability of any field identification guide, and lack of trained staff. In the opinion of the gatherers, traders, and the forest field staff, there has been a decline in the quantum of the harvest of some species and subjective ocular assessment of their population status. A temporary ban on the collection of some species by the state government is the usual response to this situation. There has been no focused action initiated in the state to strengthen the populations of any of the species already assessed as threatened, which is a matter of great concern. In view of the increasing global demand for herbal products, the pressure on the wild populations of NTFP species, including the threatened ones, is likely to increase further which demands immediate attention.
