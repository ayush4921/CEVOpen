<p id="Par33">Species with high cultural value generally have more than one uses. The greater the number of uses for the NTFP species, the more possible it is to have high cultural significance for a community. Values for particular NTFPs differ from location to location, because they relate to the evaluation by the local community of the quality, intensity, and exclusivity of the plant species within the community. A species may have high usability in one location, but not so for people in other locations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. The high cultural significance of a plant will stimulate the public to carry out plantings in order to obtain benefits in the near future [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. RI varied from 0.33 (106 species) to (1.75) 
 <italic>Juglans regia</italic> and 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum armatum</italic> followed by 
 <italic>Cedrus deodara</italic> (1.67) and 
 <italic>Rubus ellipticus</italic> (1.58). High values of quantitative indexes suggest that families rich in NTFPs are more likely to be used than others, the key factor being the local presence of NTFPs potentially available for peopleâ€™s attention and possible use. This result is similar to those reported for other regions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The use of such indexes can make it possible to compare results between different regions or cultural groups, as well as undertaking meta-analyses [
