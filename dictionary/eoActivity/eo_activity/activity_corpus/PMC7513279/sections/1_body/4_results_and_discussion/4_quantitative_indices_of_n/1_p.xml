<p id="Par31">Various quantitative indices were applied to analyze the collected ethnomedicinal data that include informant consensus use value (UV), relative frequency citation (RFC), cultural importance index (CI), cultural value (CV), and relative importance index (RI). The UV of species varied from 0.10 to 5.20 and the highest use value was reported for the plant species which had multiple uses (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). 
 <italic>Ricinus communis</italic> (UV = 5.20), 
 <italic>Withania somnifera</italic> (UV = 4.4), 
 <italic>Woodfordia fruticosa</italic> (UV = 3.30), and 
 <italic>Terminalia chebula</italic> and 
 <italic>Asparagus racemosus</italic> (UV = 3.10) recorded maximum UV probably because of its high demand in the market. The overall plant use was proportionate to the number of plant species used in ethnomedicine. UV is one of the most frequently used indexes for evaluating “the relative usefulness of plants” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. UV reflects both the number of uses made as well as the number of literature sources mentioning it. So the NTFPs with high UV value does not necessarily mean that it has multiple uses nor that it is necessarily mentioned in many publications [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. RFC varied between 0.30 (522 species, nearly 64.36% of the total) to 1.50 (8 species, nearly 0.99% of the total) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Many species with high RFC scores were likely to be used over extensive geographical areas, while many of those scoring just 0.30 were likely to be used only locally. Scores for family use value (FUV) fell between 0.25 (Gesneriaceae) and 76.75 (Asteraceae). There was very little correlation between FUV and the number of species used per family (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).
