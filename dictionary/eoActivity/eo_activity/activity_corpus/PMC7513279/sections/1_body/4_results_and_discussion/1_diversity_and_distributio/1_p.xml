<p id="Par24">The State exhibits a high dependence on NTFPs for satisfying diverse domestic needs for house use and to sell it for cash needs. A total of 811 NTFPs (excluding Lichens and Moss), belonging to 128 families and 495 genera, have been screened and listed as per the name of the species, life form, use category, and additional use(s) (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Asteraceae, Lamiaceae, Fabaceae, Rosaceae, Ranunculaceae, Polygonaceae, Apiaceae, Poaceae, Euphorbiaceae, and Gentianaceae were top ten families that collectively encompass 44% of all species (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The herbaceous was the most dominant life form (64.6% of all species) followed by shrubs (19.6%) and trees (13.9%). Most high-value NTFPs were recorded at high altitudes, used for medicinal purposes, and dominated with herbaceous form [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. An analysis of NTFPs distribution pattern revealed that maximum species (27.4%) was found in warm temperate zone (1001–1800 m), followed by the temperate (1801–2800 m) (25.3%), sub-alpine (2801–3300 m) (17.4%), sub-tropical (&lt; 1000 m) (15.81%), and alpine (&gt; 3300 m) (14.1%) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Species use has been highly dependent on the local socio-economic conditions and distribution pattern may vary from place to place [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Different families made very different contributions to different use categories. Use of NTFPs for 18 different categories show that these species are very important for the sustenance of the inhabitants. The study revealed high dependence on and a wide variety of NTFPs for the medicinal purpose (739 species), followed by edible (141 species) and fodder (109 species) purposes (Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).
