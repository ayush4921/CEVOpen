<p id="Par5">Non-timber forest products (NTFPs) play an important role in the livelihoods of the rural poor by satisfying food, fiber, fodder, medicine, construction materials, and income needs. Nearly 60% of the world’s forests that cover approximately 2.4 billion hectares of land are primarily or partially used for the production of wood and non-wood forest products [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The role of NTFP is particularly important in the Himalayan region, where a large proportion of the rural population depend on forests for meeting their livelihood needs [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A wide variety of animal and plant products are sourced as food, nutrition, fodder, fiber, medicine, condiment, dye, and various other uses for meeting household needs and/or for commercial purposes that generate substantial revenue [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Livelihood security of rural people depends greatly on the status and condition of the natural resources [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. It has been estimated that many village communities derive as much as 10–50% of their household income from the sale of forest products [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Although, NTFPs do not guarantee a high or regular income for forest people [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The community attitude toward forest resources varies depending on the distance of forest, availability of resource, and access tenure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and acts as a buffer during times of hardships [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that 80% population in the developing countries relies on NTFPs for nutritional and health needs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and over 1.2 billion of the rural population generally depend on NTFPs that supplement their basic needs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In India, more than 95% of the total medicinal plants used in preparing medicines by various industries are harvested from the wild [
