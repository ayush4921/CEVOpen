<p>The antioxidant properties and biological activity of 
 <italic>Camellia</italic> species have been extensively studied over the years, being most of the works focused in the three species with higher economic value, namely, 
 <italic>C. sinensis</italic>, 
 <italic>C. oleifera</italic> and 
 <italic>C. japonica</italic>. It should be stressed that few studies have reported differences among cultivars of the same species which is known to highly impact the biological properties of the plants. Also, no comparisons were found between distinct sample collecting seasons nor geographic regions, other known relevant features. Furthermore, the differences encountered in the presentation of the results prevent easy comparisons of the results of the diverse studies. These gaps may justify additional studies on distinct 
 <italic>Camellia</italic> species that have been somehow neglected, as well as further works comparing the impact of cultivars, collecting seasons and geographic regions on the plant properties. Also, and of high relevance, the already proven biological activity among 
 <italic>Camellia</italic> genus, clearly show that these species should be further considered in future developments of new natural based drugs.
