 <italic>C. japonica</italic> is a 
 <italic>Camellia</italic> species commonly used as an ornamental plant and is often overlooked regarding its potential as a bioactive compound source, due to the popularity of 
 <italic>C. sinensis</italic> and 
 <italic>C. oleifera</italic>. A single study, regarding its antitumor activity performed by Thao et al. in 2010 [
 <xref rid="B113-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>] was found in literature. These authors evaluated the in vitro cytotoxic activity against the cancer cell lines A549, LLC, HL-60, and MCF-7 using the MTT assay method of 
 <italic>C. japonica</italic> triterpenoids obtained from stem barks. Three newly identified compounds along with seven known ones were tested. From them, the newly identified 3β-
 <italic>O</italic>-acetyl-16β-hydroxyolean-12-en presented cytotoxicity against LLC and HL-60 cancer cell lines (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 25.2 and 21.7 mM, respectively). The remaining compounds shown weak or moderate cytotoxic activity against some of the tested cell lines. An additional study was found reporting the antitumor activity of a very uncommon camellia species, 
 <italic>Camellia osmantha</italic> [
 <xref rid="B114-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. The authors reported strong inhibitory activity against bladder cancer T-24 cells of ethanolic extracts obtained from the core fruit of this species.
