<p>Despite the synergistic antitumor effects of tea polyphenols, mostly EGCG, noticed by the previous reported studies, their potential was also evaluated alone. Mittal et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], dedicated their studies to the breast cancer cells (MCF7-line) and reported an EGCG dose-dependency inhibition of the colony forming potential (20–100%) and a cell viability decreases (around 80%) with no adverse effect on the growth of normal cells. The decrease of cell viability was associated with the inhibition of telomerase activity (40–55%), mRNA expression (40–55%) and protein expression of hTERT (human telomerase reverse transcriptase). Roy et al. [
 <xref rid="B105-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>], achieved quite similar results to those obtained by Mittal and colleagues but using the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468. These authors reported an EGCG dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation (15–100%) and cell viability decrease (3–78%) also associated to apoptosis increase. The activity of green tea EGCG was also investigated against ovarian carcinoma cell lines (p53 negative, SKOV-3 cells; mutant type p53, OVCAR-3 cells; and wild type p53, PA-1 cells), by Kim et al. [
 <xref rid="B106-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. Similar to previous studies, the antitumor effect was highly doses dependent and via apoptosis induction and cell cycle arrest which varies with the cell line considered. Recently, saponins from tea seed pomace of 
 <italic>C. oleifera</italic> were also reported as possessing cytotoxic activity on MCF-7 cells [
 <xref rid="B107-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. Saponins were fractioned under specific chromatographic conditions and the fractions obtained revealed differential antitumor activity. The antitumor activity of the raw 
 <italic>Camellia</italic> extracts was also evaluated against distinct tumour cell lines. Extracts were obtained were obtained from different species (
 <italic>C. sinensis</italic>, 
 <italic>C. oleifera</italic> and 
 <italic>C. japonica</italic>) and different parts of the plant. Choi et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] studied the in vitro biological activity of several fractions of green tea seeds at two concentrations (50 µL/mL and 100 µL/mL). The antitumor activity was evaluated against three different cell lines: HEC-1B (endometrial adenocarcinoma); HEP-2 (larynx carcinoma) and SK-OV-3 (ovary carcinoma). Fractions were non-eluted (F1) and eluted with 40% (F2) or 100% (F3) of methanol. Despite the higher antioxidant activity founded in F1, the higher antitumor activity was reported in the fraction eluted with 100% of methanol (F3). In 2010, Carvalho et al. [
 <xref rid="B108-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>] studied for the first time the effect of green tea (raw leaves extracts) against renal cell carcinoma lines A-498 and 769-P. The antiproliferative activity of the methanolic extract was examined and the results showed a powerful growth inhibition of both cell lines in a concentration-dependent manner (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 54 ± 10 for A-498 and 129 ± 28 µg/mL for 769-P cells) It should be noted that, along with the antitumor activity studies, the authors identified the extract phenolic and methylxanthine content allowing a deeper knowledge on the compounds responsible for the reported biological activity. In 2016, Rana et al. [
 <xref rid="B64-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], evaluated the bioactivity (including the antitumor against oral cancer cells) of frequently neglected tea plant parts as apical buds, stem, coarse leaves, flowers, fruits and roots. The results showed that tea fruit extract exhibited higher toxicity (71.6 to 74.9% at the concentration of 50–200 µg/mL) against oral cancer cells being comparable to the obtained with standard vinblastibe (74.2% at 2 µg/mL concentration). A positive splenocytes proliferation in mice within 24 h was also observed. Curiously, the extracts from flowers and leaves neither showed significant toxicity nor proliferation of splenocytes. The major tea constituents in different parts of the plant were also identified.
