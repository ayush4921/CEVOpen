<p>In 1999, Suganuma et al. [
 <xref rid="B102-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>] studied the synergistic effects of (2)-epicatechin (EC) with (2)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG); (2)-epigallocatechin (EGC) and (2)-epicatechin gallate (ECG) in the inhibition of lung cancer cell line PC-9 growth. Their studies were motivated by discovering that green tea extract (tea itself) has stronger inhibition effect in the tumor cells growth than the polyphenol content would have indicated. Indeed, the authors proved that the apoptosis of PC-9 cells was increased synergistically by the use of two polyphenols and by the use of EGCG in a cotreatment with sulindac (more pronounced effect) and tamoxifen. In 2000, Mimoto et al. [
 <xref rid="B103-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>] evaluated the effect of EGCG on cisplatin-induced lung tumours in A/J mice. Cisplatin is used to treat lung cancer but is also able to induce cancer in animal models. Based on that, the authors evaluated the EGCG; cisplatin and EGCG plus cisplatin activity. Tumour multiplicity (5.1 ± 2.1 to 2.8 ± 2.3) and cisplatin induced weight loss (24.7–26.3% to 10.8–11.6%) decreased when cisplatin and cisplatin plus EGCG treatments were compared. Also, Sartippour et al. [
 <xref rid="B104-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>], evaluated the synergistic effect of green tea and tamoxifen, however against breast cancer. The authors observed that green tea enhanced the inhibitory effect of tamoxifen on the proliferation of the ER (estrogen receptor)-positive MCF-7, ZR75, T47D human breast cancer cells increasing also their apoptosis in vitro. The in vivo results were also promising; mice treated with the combination demonstrated the smallest MCF-7 xenograft tumor size and also the highest levels of apoptosis.
