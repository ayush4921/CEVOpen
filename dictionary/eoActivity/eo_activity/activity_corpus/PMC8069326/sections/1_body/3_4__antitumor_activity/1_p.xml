<p>Okuda et al. [
 <xref rid="B101-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>] was one of the first authors to report the antitumor activity of 
 <italic>Camellia</italic> spp. namely, 
 <italic>C. oleifera</italic> and 
 <italic>C. sinensis</italic>. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the main polyphenol of green tea, was referenced as a “cancer preventing agent”. Later, many other studies proved the antitumor activity of 
 <italic>Camellia</italic> spp being most of them associated with 
 <italic>C. sinensis</italic>. The antitumor potential of this species was highly explored whether using raw 
 <italic>C. sinensis</italic> leaves extracts, their purified compounds or their commercially available polyphenols alone or synergistically with the most used antitumor drugs.
