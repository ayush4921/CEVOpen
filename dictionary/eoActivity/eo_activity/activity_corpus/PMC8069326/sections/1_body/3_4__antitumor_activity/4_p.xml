<p>Regarding 
 <italic>C. oleifera</italic>, in 2012, Jin reported the antitumor activity of the polysaccharide obtained from seed cake and fruit shell of 
 <italic>C. oleifera</italic> Abel in two different studies [
 <xref rid="B109-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>,
 <xref rid="B110-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. An antitumor rate of 85.6% was obtained (doses dependent) against Sarcoma 180 solid tumour grown in mice with seed cake polysaccharide and of 65.2% with seed shells. The authors claim that such compound possess “powerful tumor-fighting properties in vivo,” without relevant cytotoxicity. Also, the few and inexpensive extraction and isolation steps of the polysaccharide could be an added advantage for industry. Tingting Li et al. [
 <xref rid="B111-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>] reported the in vitro antitumor activities of the three major ingredients (saponin, protein, and polysaccharide) obtained from defatted seeds against the human hepatoma cell line (Hep G2 cells) and normal rat liver cell lines (IAR20). Despite the remarkable antitumor activity exhibited by the three compounds, better results were obtained with the polysaccharide against Hep G2 cells (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 5.826 µg/mL), followed by saponin (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 26.754 µg/mL) and protein (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 36.794 µg/mL)The inhibition rate of the three compounds on Hep G2 cells was higher than 80% at the higher concentration tested (200 µg/mL) being on IAR20 cells dependent on the considered compound (1.35 ± 0.07, 0.61 ± 0.03 and 25.27 ± 0.09% for protein, polysaccharide and saponin, respectively). Later, Chaikul et al. [
 <xref rid="B112-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>] studied the cytotoxicity and activity on melanogenesis of 
 <italic>C. oleifera</italic> seed oil with the ultimate goal of utilize it as a functional oil in health, cosmetic products and feed. Cytotoxicity was evaluated by the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay in B16-F10 melanoma cells and 3T3-L1 cells demonstrating cell viabilities of 94.59 ± 3.41% and 97.57 ± 1.62%, respectively. The melanogenesis revealed to be via inhibition of tyrosinase and tyrosinase-related protein-2 activities. According to the authors, their results clearly indicated the potential of the seed oil as a functional oil.
