<p>Beyond these three relevant species, 
 <italic>C. sinensis</italic>, 
 <italic>C. japonica</italic> and 
 <italic>C. oleifera</italic>, other 
 <italic>Camellia</italic> species were investigated [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,

 <xref rid="B55-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. However, the few reports found used distinct assays and experimental conditions preventing any comparison of the antioxidant potential of the species. Gao and co-workers [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] evaluated the antioxidant activities of 19 phenolic compounds from 
 <italic>Camellia taliensis</italic> leaves and concluded that they possess significant DPPH radical scavenging activity. Hydrolysable tannins and flavan-3-ols with catechol and/or pyrogallol groups in the molecule presented stronger DPPH radical scavenging activities. Also, other authors reported the DPPH and ABTS scavenging activity of a flavan-3-ol dimer isolated from 
 <italic>C. talensis</italic> leaves [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Fruit and seed shell and pomace of 
 <italic>Camellia tenuifloria</italic> organic and aqueous fractions were reported by Chiou [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] as possessing antioxidant activity, being the activity dependent on the part of the plant and solvent considered. Other authors, using different species, obtained similar results in what concerns to the variability of the antioxidant potential of the species with the part of the plant considered [
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Studies on less common 
 <italic>Camellia</italic> species are also found in literature [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] stressing the high potential of this plants as a source of bioactive molecules.
