 <italic>C. oleifera</italic> is a source of cooking oil which has already proven effects on skin diseases and as a burn treatment. Due to its economic relevance, this species was also quite studied regarding its antioxidant properties, particularly its seed oil and cake, the byproduct obtained after the oil refining process. Regarding the oil, several organic compound were used for the extraction steps and a higher radical scavenging activity (DPPH and ABTS assays) was obtained with methanol [

 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Yu and colleagues developed an extraction method based on water and were able to achieve better performance in the ABTS assay with this new method than with an organic solvent [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. An unconventional work was also developed with and without steam explosion pre-treatment and the authors concluded that the steam explosion increased the DPPH scavenging activity of the extract [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Defatted seeds were also investigated in a study which compared the proficiency of isopropanol and butanol as extraction solvents being the best results obtained with isopropanol [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Several authors have demonstrated the antioxidant potential of seed cake components, namely of isolated kaempferol glycosides [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], saponins [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], ad purified polysaccharides [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and pomace [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Zhu and colleagues compared the impact of two extraction methods (mechanochemical-assisted extraction-MCAE and with heat reflux-HRE) on the DPPH scavenging activity and in the ferric thiocyanate assay of kaempferol glycosides and concluded that the former method led to a better performance [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Other studies also concluded that the experimental conditions [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], the extraction method [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and the solvents [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] all impact the antioxidant activity of the extracts. Indeed, the antioxidant activity of a seed cake saponin seems to be pH dependent (pH = 9.0 being the optimal value) and temperature independent [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. On the other hand, ethyl acetate extracts possess higher radical scavenging activity when compared with the ones obtained with ethanol and butanol [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. A unique study was dedicated to the leaves of this species [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The authors evaluated the antioxidant potential of three fractions of a crude polysaccharide and concluded that all showed remarkable antioxidant activities in a concentration-dependent manner.
