<p>Medicinal plants have been used since antiquity exhibiting high benefits on health and proved pharmacological activities. Several species among 
 <italic>Camellia</italic> genus have been pointed as possessing a set of benefits including anti-osteoporotic, anti-inflammatory and antidiabetic activity, as blood pressure and body fat reducing agents among others (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02178-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Negishi et al. [
 <xref rid="B115-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>] evaluated black and green tea polyphenols’ capacity to attenuate blood pressure increases in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats. The results shown that during the daytime, systolic and diastolic blood pressure were considerably lower in the black and green tea polyphenol groups than in control groups. Also, in 2007, Potenza et al. [
 <xref rid="B116-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>] studied the EGCG benefits in endothelial function, insulin sensitivity and reduction of blood pressure against myocardial I/R injury in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and conclude that EGCG therapy was able to simultaneously improve metabolic and cardiovascular pathophysiology in SHR, to reduce infarct size and improve cardiac function. Wu et al. [
 <xref rid="B117-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>] demonstrated an anti-osteoporotic effect of EtOH extracts of the seeds of 
 <italic>C. semiserrata</italic> Chi., in a tretinoin-induced osteoporotic in vivo rat model and a positive estrogenic activity positively related with the number of sugar moieties and acetyl groups of the extracts. The antidiabetic activity of green tea (Thea sinensis L.) was explored by Miura et al. [
 <xref rid="B118-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>] in genetically type 2 diabetic mice (KK-Ay) whose showed that a dose of 100 mg/Kg body weight of green tea cold extract could reduce the blood glucose 4 and 8 weeks after repeated administration in hyperinsulinemia mices but not in normal mices. In 2018, Zhang et al. [
 <xref rid="B119-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>] also studied the in vitro hypoglycemic activity of polysaccharides from 
 <italic>C. oleifera</italic> seed cake measuring glucose uptake in cultured HepG2 cells and concluded that the extracts can stimulate the consumption of the glucose in the medium by the cells. In 2007, Nagao et al. [
 <xref rid="B120-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>] studied the reduction of body fat and cardiovascular risks in humans by green tea extracts. The study included Japanese women and men with visceral fat-type obesity. After a 2-week diet run-in period, a 12-week double blind parallel multicenter trial which the subjects ingested green tea containing 583 mg of catechins (catechin group) or 96 mg of catechins (control group) per day was performed. The results showed that catechin group decreased in systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, body weight and fat mass, index waist and hip circumference and also subcutaneous and visceral fat area. Several years later, Li et al. 2016 [
 <xref rid="B121-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>] studied the impacts of 
 <italic>Camellia kucha</italic> and its main chemical components also on the lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes but in rats. Kucha tea (KT) revealed anti-adipogenic activity (dose-dependent) demonstrating significant decrease in lipid droplet accumulation. KT also diminished the mRNA and protein levels of fatty acid synthase, fatty acid translocase, steroylcoenzyme A desaturase-1, lipoprotein lipase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase-1. Chan et al. 2010 [
 <xref rid="B122-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>] studied the effects of EGCG on retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell migration and adhesion. The results demonstrated that EGCG can inhibit cell migration in a dose-dependent manner and RPE cell adhesion to fibronectin preventing epiretinal membrane formation and protect for some eyes diseases. Ye et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] studied the anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities of the hydrolysed sasanquasaponins from the defatted seeds of 
 <italic>C. oleifera</italic>. The results showed anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities with production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and PGE2 inhibited. Levites et al. 2003 [
 <xref rid="B123-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>] studied the neuroprotection and neurorescue against Aβ toxicity and PKC-dependent release of non-amyloidogenic soluble precursor protein by green tea polyphenol EGCG. The authors concluded that EGCG can protect and rescue PC12 cells against the β-amyloid (Aβ) toxicity (in a dose-dependent manner). Yoon et al. [
 <xref rid="B124-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>] studied the anti-hyperuricemic effect in vitro and in vivo (mice with 4 weeks old) of the biologically active constituents of ethanol 
 <italic>C. japonica</italic> leaf extracts (ECJL). In vitro, ECJL inhibited xanthine oxidase activity by 41.3 ± 5.5% (dose-dependent) and in vivo, at the doses of 100 and 300 mg/kg, inhibited hepatic xanthine oxidase activity, highly attenuating hyperuricemia. Jeon et al. 2018 [
 <xref rid="B125-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>] evaluated the effects of the extracts from fruit and stem of 
 <italic>C. japonica</italic> on induced pluripotency and wound healing in vivo mouse wound model and proved that the extracts enhanced mouse and human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) generation and promoted effective wound healing. Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B126-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>] reported the protective effects of camellia oil (
 <italic>Camellia brevistyla</italic>) against indomethacin-induced gastrointestinal mucosal damage in vitro and in vivo (human intestinal Int-407 cells and a mouse model of indomethacin-induced gastric mucosal damage). The experiments revealed that a pre-treatment with Camellia oil can increased cell viability, wound healing and reduced reactive oxygen species production in the cells. In vivo results demonstrated that pre-administration of camellia oil prevented gastric wound damage by decreasing inflammatory mediators as interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α and cyclooxygenase-2 levels. Kim et al. [
 <xref rid="B127-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>] studied the protective effects of 
 <italic>C. japonica</italic> flower extract (CJFE) against urban air pollutants by urban-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in vitro cultured normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) and in an ex vivo model. CJFE was able to stop the urban air pollutants-induced ROS generation and matrixmetalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) production and demonstrated very good protective activity against pollutants-induced deteriorating effects in the ex vivo model by reducing the lipid peroxidation marker and the level of pollutants-induced malondialdehyde (MDA). Zhang et al. [
 <xref rid="B128-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>] evaluated the mutagenicity and safety of the water extract of 
 <italic>C. oleifera</italic> Abel (WECO) and find no toxic effects or significant differences on clinical chemistry value, body weight, hematology value or organ/body weight ratio. The NOAEL for WECO was 2 g/kg/BW for subacute toxicity study. These studies included different parts of different 
 <italic>Camellia</italic> species demonstrating the importance of the genus 
 <italic>Camellia</italic> in research for its benefits on health and diseases. Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B129-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>] evaluated the toxicological effect of dietary excess of saccharicterpenin, the extract of 
 <italic>camellia</italic> seed meal (
 <italic>C. oleifera</italic>), in piglets. The dietary supplementation of about 500 mg·kg
 <sup>−1</sup> had beneficial effects on piglets improving liver glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity but higher supplementations (as 2500 or 5000 mg·kg
 <sup>−1</sup>) could lead to growth retardation, hematological abnormalities and organ injuries.
