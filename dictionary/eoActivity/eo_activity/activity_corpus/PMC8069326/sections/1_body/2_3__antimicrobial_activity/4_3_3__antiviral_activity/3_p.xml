<p>Influenza viruses were also the target of several studies using 
 <italic>Camellia</italic> species extracts or pure compounds. In 2005, Song et al. [
 <xref rid="B90-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>] studied the antiviral effect of green tea catechins on influenza virus and demonstrated that the EGCG and ECG ((âˆ’)-epicatechin gallate) were potent influenza virus replication inhibitors in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell cultures. This effect was observed in all influenza virus subtypes tested, including A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B virus and attributed to the 3-galloyl group of the catechin skeleton that seems to be able to alter the physical properties of viral membrane. The same viruses were studied later by other authors [
 <xref rid="B91-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>] which concluded that theaflavin derivatives are anti-influenza compounds through the inhibition of the viral HA gene replication. The inhibitory effect of EGCG on the growth of Influenza A and B viruses in MDCK cells was also studied by Nakayama et al. [
 <xref rid="B92-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>] and Imanishi et al. [
 <xref rid="B93-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. The first authors reported that EGCG agglutinated influenza viruses and prevented the viruses from adsorbing to MDCK cells while Imanishi and colleagues noticed that GTE exerts an additional inhibitory effect on the acidification of intracellular compartments such as endosomes, lysosomes and thereby inhibiting the growth of both viruses. A more complete study evaluated the activity of several tea polyphenols against influenza viruses A and B. The authors [
 <xref rid="B94-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>] reported the inhibitory activity of five and six polyphenols against influenza A and B, respectively and stablished a structure-activity relationship. Generally, dimeric molecules such as theaflavin and procyanidin B-2 displayed more potent activity than monomeric ones and that the planar structure of kaempferol is crucial for the anti-influenza B activity. 
 <italic>C. sinensis</italic> raw extracts (black tea) also demonstrated activity against Influenza H5N1, a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, inoculated in MDCK cells [
 <xref rid="B95-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Indeed, Baatartsogt and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B95-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>] compared the activity of several row extracts from commercial teas and found that hibiscus and black tea were effective in virus titers reduction. A more daily application against influenza virus was reported by Shin et al. [
 <xref rid="B96-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>] which demonstrated that the virus infectivity on the skin cell layer became obsolete when washed with a green tea solution.
