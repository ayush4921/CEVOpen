<p>Four additional studies were found in literature discussing the antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>C. sinensis</italic> var 
 <italic>assamica</italic>. Kristanti and Punbusayakul [
 <xref rid="B67-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] studied the antimicrobial activity of 5 samples of commercial Assam Green Tea against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>S. typhimurium</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>. All samples possess higher activity against Gram-positive bacteria being the better results reported in samples with higher total polyphenol content which is in accordance with previously reported studies. Mehrotra et al. [
 <xref rid="B68-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] also reported antimicrobial activity of this 
 <italic>C. sinensis</italic> variety against 
 <italic>Vibrio cholerae, S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Abdulbaqi et al. [
 <xref rid="B69-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] reported a relevant synergistic effect of green tea (
 <italic>C. sinensis</italic> var. 
 <italic>assamica</italic>) and 
 <italic>Salvadora persica</italic> L. against primary colonizers of dental plaque 
 <italic>Streptococcus mitis</italic>, 
 <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> and 
 <italic>Actinomyces viscosus</italic>. Also, Kawarai et al. [
 <xref rid="B70-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] studied biofilm formation of 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic> using extracts from Assam tea and green tea. The results revealed that Assam tea (high concentration of galloylated catechins) possess stronger biofilm inhibition activity against than green tea (higher concentrations of galacturonic acid, such as pectin). These studies suggest that 
 <italic>Camellia</italic> extracts may also have potential applications in preventing dental caries, dental plaque control and other oral health problems associated with serious damage.
