<p>Although most of the studies to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>Camellia</italic> species extracts were undertaken in vitro, Thakur et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] tested aquoethanolic (1:1) leaves extracts of 
 <italic>C. sinensis</italic> against carbapenem resistant 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, in vivo, in a murine model (Sprague Dawley rats). The results showed that a single doses extract (5 mg/Kg bwt; oral, +24 h) was very effective against this pathogen. Also, Khan et al. [
 <xref rid="B75-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] undertook a comprehensive in vitro and in vivo study of the antimicrobial activity of green tea seed extracted and isolated saponins various strains of Gram positive and negative bacteria (
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and six serovars of 
 <italic>Salmonella: S. typhimurium</italic>, 
 <italic>S. enteritidis</italic>, 
 <italic>Salmonella gallinarum</italic>, 
 <italic>Salmonella choleraesuis</italic>, 
 <italic>Salmonella pullorum</italic> and
