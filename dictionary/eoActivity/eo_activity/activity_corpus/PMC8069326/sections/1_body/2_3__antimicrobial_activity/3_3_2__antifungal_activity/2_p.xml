<p>Rize tea and young shoot tea, two Turkish black tea extracts, were reported as ineffective against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, one of the most opportunistic pathogens, as well as against other microorganisms [
 <xref rid="B58-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Also, Chakraborty and Chakraborti in 2010 [
 <xref rid="B77-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] concluded that the leaves methanolic extract of green tea (
 <italic>C. sinensis</italic>) has no activity against two species of 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic>. Both studies included four distinct extracts concentrations which somehow reinforce their conclusions.
