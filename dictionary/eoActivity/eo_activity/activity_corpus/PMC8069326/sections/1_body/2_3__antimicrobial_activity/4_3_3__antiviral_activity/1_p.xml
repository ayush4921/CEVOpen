<p>Flavonoids are a group of phenolic compounds present in plants mostly as secondary metabolites being widespread in their flowers, fruits (including nuts) or roots as well as in their sub products like wine or tea. Indeed, tea is pointed as an innate immunity modulator which can enhance immune response in order to mitigate COVID-19 (SARS-COV-2) [
