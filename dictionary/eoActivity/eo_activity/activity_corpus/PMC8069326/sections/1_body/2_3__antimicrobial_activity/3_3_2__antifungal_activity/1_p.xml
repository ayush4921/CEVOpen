<p>The antifungal activity of 
 <italic>Camellia</italic> spp was evaluated by several authors, being most of the studies focused on the popular plant tea, 
 <italic>C. sinensis</italic>. Fungus and yeasts were studied and the reported results were not always consensual. The heterogeneity of the results seems not to be related with the use of crude extracts versus purified compounds once antifungal activity was reported using both. Nevertheless, the works showing no 
 <italic>Camellia</italic> antifungal activity only used crude extracts.
