<p>The popularity of 
 <italic>C. sinensis</italic> due to their highly appreciated subproduct, tea, totally eclipses the remaining 
 <italic>Camellia</italic> species and few studies were dedicated to them. Feás et al. 2013 [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] studied the activity of seeds virgin oils from 
 <italic>C. oleifera, C. reticulata</italic> and 
 <italic>C. sasanqua</italic> against clinical strains of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>. The three oils evidenced antifungal activity exhibiting different MICs. 
 <italic>C. reticulata</italic> and 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>oleifera</italic> oils showed the best and similar antifungal activity (20.833 ± 7.217 mg/mL) followed by (20.833 ± 7.217 mg/mL) 
 <italic>C. sasanqua</italic> (29.167 ± 19.094 mg/mL). In 2015, Meng et al. [
 <xref rid="B74-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] studied the antifungal activity of the crude extractum from 
 <italic>C. semiserrata</italic> Chi (Nanshancha) seed cake (NSC) against three postharvest pathogens (
 <italic>Colletotrichum musae</italic>, 
 <italic>Colletotrichum gloeosporioides</italic> and 
 <italic>Penicillium italicum</italic>) performing in vitro and in vivo (Fruit Test) tests. The in vitro tests showed a higher inhibition rate for 
 <italic>C. musae</italic>, followed by 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>gloeosporioides</italic> and 
 <italic>P. italicum.</italic> Such values were quite similar to those obtained with tea saponin for 
 <italic>C. musae</italic> and 
 <italic>P. italicum</italic> being even higher for 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>gloeosporioides</italic> (90.9 ± 1.7% versus 49.8 ± 3.2%). The in vivo antifungal activity was evaluated by means of the fruit lesion caused by the three fungi after exposition to NSC crude extractum. The extractum proved to be able to eliminate the lesion diameter in banana; to kept it constant and lower when compared with the untreated fruit for mango and to maintain it slightly lower for the Shatang mandarin when compared with the untreated fruit and tea saponin effect.
