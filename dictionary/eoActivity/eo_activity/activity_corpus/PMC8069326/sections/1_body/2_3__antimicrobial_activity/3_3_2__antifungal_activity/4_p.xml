<p>The previous studies reporting the antifungal activity were performed using somehow purified compounds; however, other works also report such activity using crude extracts. Archana and Abraham in 2011 [
 <xref rid="B79-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] did a comparative analysis of the antifungal activity of leaf extracts from fresh green tea, commercial green tea and black tea on 
 <italic>Fusarium, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger</italic> and 
 <italic>C. albicans.</italic> The fresh green tea methanolic extract was found to have higher activity. Later, Orak et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] also studied the antifungal activities of tea extracts (white, green and black). All extracts exhibited antifungal activity against two aflatoxigenic moulds 
 <italic>Aspergillus parasiticus</italic> with a positive correlation with the extract concentration. The results obtained by Orak and colleagues were in agreement with those obtained by Archana and Abraham in 2011 [
 <xref rid="B79-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] being the green tea extracts the ones presenting the higher inhibitory rates.
