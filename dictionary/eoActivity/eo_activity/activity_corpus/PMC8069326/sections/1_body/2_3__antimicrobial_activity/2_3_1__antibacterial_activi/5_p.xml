<p>In 2019, Shetta et al. [
 <xref rid="B66-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] compared for the first time the antimicrobial activity of raw and green tea essential oils in encapsulated chitosan nanoparticles. The authors found that green tea essential oils nanoparticles possess a greater activity against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> with ~9.4 foldsâ€™ improvement compared to pure green tea oil and ~4.7 fold against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. From this study arises that not only the compounds extraction procedure is a relevant step on the microbial activity but also the way they are used.
