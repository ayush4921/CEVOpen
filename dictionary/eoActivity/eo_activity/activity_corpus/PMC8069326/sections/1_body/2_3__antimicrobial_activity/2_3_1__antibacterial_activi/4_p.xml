<p>Üstündag˘ et al. [
 <xref rid="B65-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] also discussed the hypothesis of the black tea processing waste (BTPW) being the source of antimicrobial phenolic compounds against 
 <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> and 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> and the effects of solvent (water, 50% ethanol and 80% ethanol) on the antimicrobial activity. Water and ethanolic extracts showed antimicrobial activity against all bacteria tested being the best results obtained for aqueous ethanol extracts which possess higher phenolic content.
