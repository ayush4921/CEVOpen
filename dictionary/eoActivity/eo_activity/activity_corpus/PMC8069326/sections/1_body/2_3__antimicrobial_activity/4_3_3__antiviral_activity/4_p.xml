<p>Tea also demonstrated activity against herpes simplex viruses type 1 and 2. Prodelphinidin B-2 3′-O-gallate) isolated from green tea leaves was reported by Cheng et al. [

 <sub>50</sub> = 5.0 ± 1.0 µM and 1.6 ± 0.3 µM for XTT and plaque reduction assays, respectively). Prodelphinidin B-2 3′-O-gallate seems affected the late stage of HSV-2 infection and also shown to inhibit the virus from attaching and penetrating into the cell. Oliveira et al. [
 <xref rid="B98-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>] demonstrated the activity of three theaflavins isolated from black tea against herpes simplex type 1 in Vero and A549 cells. The authors claim the relevance of their study based on the growing herpes simplex virus resistant strains and the need of developing new antiherpesviral treatments. Also, other common tea catechin derivatives demonstrated to possess antiherpetic activity [
