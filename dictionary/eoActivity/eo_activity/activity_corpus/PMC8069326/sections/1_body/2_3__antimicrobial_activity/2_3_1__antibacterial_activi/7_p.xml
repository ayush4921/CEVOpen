<p>Also, 
 <italic>C. japonica</italic> was evaluated regarding its antimicrobial activity against several bacteria (
 <italic>S. typhimurium</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic>Streptococcus faecalis</italic>, 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>). Kim et al. [
 <xref rid="B71-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] describe the antibacterial activity in extracts of 
 <italic>C. japonica</italic> L. petals (extracted with methanol and fractionated into basic, acidic, and neutral fractions). None of the microorganisms was totally inhibited and the basic fraction showed no antibacterial activity. Gram negative 
 <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> demonstrated slightly greater sensitivity than the Gram positive 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> to the extracts. Moon and Kim [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] studied the antimicrobial activities of fermented 
 <italic>C. japonica</italic> L. leaf extracts (70% ethanol and 100% methanol) against 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>, 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic>K. pneumonia</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. The authors concluded that the ethanol extracts possess higher antimicrobial activities against all bacteria and that the antimicrobial activity was doses dependent for both extracts. Sharma et al. [
 <xref rid="B72-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] also reported antimicrobial activity in several microorganisms but of gold nanoparticles using 
 <italic>C. japonica</italic> L. leaf extract. The activity seems to be similar for all the tested bacteria.
