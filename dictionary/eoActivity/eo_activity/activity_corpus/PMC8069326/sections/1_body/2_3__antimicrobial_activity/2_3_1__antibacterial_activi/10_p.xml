<p>The antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>Camellia</italic> species extracts was mainly explored against human pathogens. A single study was found in literature that reports the activity of green tea extracts in 
 <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> pv. actinidiae (Psa), the agent that causes kiwifruit bacterial cancer [
 <xref rid="B76-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. The results showed that tea extracts strongly inhibited Psa growth and swimming motility. Also, a significant loss of virulence was observed after tea extract treatment.
