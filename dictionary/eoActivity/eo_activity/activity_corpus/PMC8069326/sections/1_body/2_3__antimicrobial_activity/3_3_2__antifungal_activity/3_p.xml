<p>Despite these two works, 
 <italic>Camellia</italic> species have been pointed as a great source of bioactive compounds including antifungal ones. 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> seems to be susceptible to several catechins (pH dependent), which also enhance the antifungal effect of amphotericin B and fluconazole [
 <xref rid="B78-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Also, Li et al. [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] reported a pH-dependent activity of commercial tea saponins (isolated from 
 <italic>C. sinensis</italic> seeds) against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>. In this study, low pH values lead to lower minimum inhibitory concentrations while in the Hirasawa and Takada [
 <xref rid="B78-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] work, acidic conditions decreased the effectiveness of the considered catechins. Choi et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-26-02178" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] also studied the antifungal activity of green tea seeds using, however, homemade extracts. The study evaluated three different fractions: F1—non-adsorption fraction; F2—eluted with 40% methanol and F3—eluted 100% methanol against 
 <italic>C. albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Alternaria alternate</italic> and 
 <italic>Rhizoctonia solani</italic> cultures. The results shown a positive correlation between the concentration and inhibitory activity being fractions F2 and F3 the most active.
