<p>Terpenoids are another major group of plant metabolites seen in cannabis. Along with their role in photosynthesis, respiration, and plant defense, terpenoids are responsible for the flavor and aroma of different cannabis varieties and are considered as a major crucial factor of preference of the cannabis users. The therapeutic benefit of medicinal cannabis is that to produce a retinue effect, cannabinoids may function in synergy with terpenoids [

The terpenoids biosynthesis pathway is initiated from isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and its isomer dimethyl-allyl diphosphate (DMAPP) which is derived from the cytosolic mevalonate pathway (MVA) or plastidial deoxyxylulose phosphate/methyl-erythritol phosphate (DOXP/MEP) pathway and ended up with different types of C10, C15 and C30, C20 compounds [
