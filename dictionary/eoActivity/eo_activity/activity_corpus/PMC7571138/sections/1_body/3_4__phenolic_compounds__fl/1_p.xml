<p>Phenolic compounds consist of more than 10,000 diverge ranges of molecules such as phenolic acids, flavonoids, stilbenes, and lignans [

 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-04036" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. These flavonoids have been isolated from leaves, flowers, and pollens and include the

Phenylalanine and malonyl-CoA are two precursors which trigger the enzymatic synthesis cascade of main structures of flavones and flavonols in cannabis [
