<p>Among hundreds of products derived from cannabis, there are growing demands for cannabinoids, mainly CBD, with many diverse therapeutic and nutritional properties in veterinary or human medicine. Today, more and more people around the whole world tend to use different forms of cannabinoids, and there is fierce competition between companies to formulate and receive approval for new products, which indicates that a large part of CBDâ€™s immediate future is the pharmaceutical and food industries. Towards such disciplines, more countries are rapidly adapting regulations to accommodate these new uses, despite the limitations related to THC. The output of such an idea would be that the perception of cannabis as an abuse drug that harms people is progressively changing to cannabis/hemp as a medicine, food, feed, drink, beauty, and health product. Hemp potential as source of supplementary and healthy food remains largely to be investigated in adequately powered clinical trials. However, still the biggest challenges towards acceptance and consensus of such an idea which must be addressed will be THC content, public concerns, lack of knowledge and awareness, gaps in data, ethnic and religious prejudices, national or regional regulations and regulatory authorities, FDA concern regarding health risk assessment, and significant investment of capital and resources.</p>
