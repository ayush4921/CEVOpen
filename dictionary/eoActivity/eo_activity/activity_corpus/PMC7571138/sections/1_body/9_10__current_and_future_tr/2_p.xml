<p>What the international community is witnessing right now is an effort to adjust countriesâ€™ policies and to reach a consensus on cannabis/hemp to have the maximum productivity of this plant. Especially over the past decade, the scientific community and public society have increasingly accepted cannabis specifically hemp as much more than a recreational drug. In fact, the introduction of hemp as a valuable promising source with medicinal and nutritional properties has somewhat alleviated public concerns. However, there is still a lack of awareness and much confusion in the distinction between different types of cannabis. Whether it is accepted or not, the current trend is to improve the value of hemp and its various derived products so that it becomes more visible in human life, while respecting concerns, laws, and regulations.</p>
