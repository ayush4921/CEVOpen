<p>In case of the review and rewriting of the national regulations related to cannabis, Iran can be considered among the best ideal regions for the outdoor growing of cannabis and hemp using original native varieties based on our experience over the past decade. As a snack or bird food, hempseed has long existed in Persian culture. Cannabis is called “Shah-Daneh” in Persian, which means “king of the seeds” and has been cultivated for many years. Hempseed nutritional properties have not really been recognized in Iran as food for humans and feed for domesticated animals. However, a redoubled effort has been made over the past decade to introduce hempseed as food and feed.</p>
