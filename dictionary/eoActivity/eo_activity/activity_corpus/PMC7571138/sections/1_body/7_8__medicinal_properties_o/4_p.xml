<p>Among other amazing pharmacological effects of cannabinoids is related to their effects on psychiatric syndromes. The therapeutic effects of different types of cannabinoids are well known with various drugs being derived from these compounds [
 <xref rid="B131-molecules-25-04036" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]. Multiple clinical, in vivo and in vitro studies have identified the pharmacological effects as well as the positive effects of cannabinoids in psychiatric syndromes. These effects may be due to the agonistic nature of these compounds with endocannabinoids that compete with CB1 and CB2 receptors [
