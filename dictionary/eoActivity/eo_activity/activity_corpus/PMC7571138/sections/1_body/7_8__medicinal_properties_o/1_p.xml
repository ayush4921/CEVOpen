<p>With respect to the over one hundred phytocannabinoids found in cannabis, Δ9-THC is one of the most important psychoactive compounds [

 <xref rid="B116-molecules-25-04036" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. THC is functional and effective in the human system due to its ability to mimic the skin’s natural endogenous agonists of CB receptors-endocannabinoids [

THC has many beneficial activities, for example, antiemetic and analgesic, and could be used for the treatment of anorexia, glaucoma, chemotherapy-induced emesis, and several types of cancer. However, its potent psychoactivity prevents or limits its medical use [

Unlike THC, it can work independently of some cannabinoid receptors because CBD has a limited affinity for some of these traditional receptors. However, CBD has been shown to interact with other different groups of receptors. These include the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), the transient receptor potential channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1), and the orphan G-protein coupled receptor (GPR55), and the exact roles in endocannabinoid signaling are yet to be fully clarified. CBD has anxiolytic properties which may counteract the psychoactive effects of THC [
