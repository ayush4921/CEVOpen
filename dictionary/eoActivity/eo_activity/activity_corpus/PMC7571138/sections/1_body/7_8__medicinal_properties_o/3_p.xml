<p>Apart from its neuromodulatory role, the endocannabinoid system is also involved in the regulation of energy metabolism, the body’s immune responses, and reproductive and cardiovascular processes [

Given the importance of the endocannabinoid system in the control of multiple critical processes, pharmacological intervention in order to correct disorders in processes regulated by ECS is a promising therapeutic approach. For example, cannabinoids have found useful application in the field of palliative medicine. Indeed, two cannabinoid-based drugs, nabilone and dronabinol, have now been approved for human use by the US FDA [

Nabilone (THC synthetic analogue) is currently used for the treatment of sleep disorders and for alleviating the symptoms of nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy. Dronabinol (synthetic THC) is used for treating or reversing the weight loss caused by AIDS and also for the control of nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy. Another drug, nabiximols (Sativex
 <sup>®</sup>, oromucosal spray, THC and CBD in 1:1 ratio), is approved for use in 10 countries in the European Union as well as Canada. In these countries, nabiximols is specifically used to treat multiple sclerosis-related spasticity. The use of cannabinoids in in vitro and animal models has indicated that these compounds exhibit anticancer effects and could potentially be used as a chemotherapeutic agent [
