 <xref rid="B25-molecules-25-04036" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The main cannabis secondary metabolites include cannabinoids, phenolic compounds such as flavonoids, stilbenoids, lignamides, and phenolic amides, terpenoids, alkaloids, noncannabinoid phenols, as well as other common compounds [

 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-04036" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, the most important secondary metabolites from cannabis are the cannabinoids. This group of compounds is found exclusively in cannabis and has been the most thoroughly characterized chemical substances in this plant. Production of such compounds depends on cultivar genetic background, plant developmental stage and maturity, growth conditions, harvest time, storage and poststorage conditions [
