<p>During more than 6000 years of cannabis emergence, over 25,000 different products have been derived and used for various purposes from this plant. Long after using fiber and seeds, cannabis was used as a medicine from the time of Emperor Shen-Nung (2.700 B.C.). In ancient medicine, cannabis was used to treat rheumatic pain, intestinal constipation, female reproductive disorders, and malaria [

Presently, there is an intense scientific competition between the world’s largest research centers in the quest for finding cannabis plants with unique specific genotypes/chemotypes and hemp varieties with low THC (&lt;0.2–0.3%) that can be industrially used or cultivated. Cannabis can be fibrous in nature and can be easily cultivated on a large scale and used as an industrial material. Accordingly, the figures indicate an annual trade of over USD 100 million for these chemotypes [

Given the nutritional and medicinal value of cannabis and the urgent need to provide appropriate medicines for the treatment of major diseases worldwide, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), cancer, and AIDS, the natural medicinal potential of using this plant for disease treatment requires further exploration. In addition, as a result of the well-recognized negative effects of some synthetic drugs and the tendency of physicians and patients to prescribe and use safe and effective drugs, there is an increasing need for the use of safe herbal resources with little or no side effects. Consequently, the demand for research on the discovery of active ingredients of medicinal plants such as cannabis for medical applications has been increasing too. As a result, its genome and transcriptome have now been sequenced [

Some of the most effective drugs for the prevention or treatment of major diseases such as malaria, MS, etc. in humans have been derived from medicinal plants. This has also stimulated the interest of researchers with respect to medicinal plants especially on the therapeutic effects of the resulting compounds extracted from these plants.
