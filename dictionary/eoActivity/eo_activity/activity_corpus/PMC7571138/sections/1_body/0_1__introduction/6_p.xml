<p>Cannabis is not popular just for its narcotic and therapeutic properties but also for many other positive effects on human life such as fiber-based products, textiles, nutritional supplements and seed oil, food and feed, and cosmetics. Cannabis (hemp) has been known for many centuries as an excellent source of fiber because of the cheap processing costs and the high quality of cannabis fibers. The strongest and longest natural fibers are obtained from cannabis with fiber extraction being one of the most important uses of hemp. Fiber is used as a raw material in the manufacture of ropes, sails, and fabric [

Cannabis fiber has been used for many years as a safe, inexpensive, environmentally friendly, and recyclable raw material for the production of paper, paper towels, clothing and hats, and even shoes in many countries in Europe, especially in the Netherlands. Since the hemp is very rich in cellulose, it is now increasingly being used in the production of degradable plastic products. Hemp fibers are also now used as a component of fiberglass production in many industries. Given the pressing need to reduce deforestation and the need for the use of renewable fiber in the wood and paper industries, hemp is a good candidate for promoting the efficient use of natural resources from forests. Despite the decline in cannabis cultivation due to existing legal constraints, some EU policies have been developed to encourage the cultivation of hemp as a natural fiber producing plant species [
