<p>Cannabinoids are synthesized through either the polyketide pathway or deoxyxylulose phosphate/methylerythritol phosphate (DOXP/MEP) pathway which lead to the production of olivetolic acid (OLA) and geranyl diphosphate (GPP), respectively [

The next stage giving rise to CBGA, the central precursor of Δ9- tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (Δ9-THCA), CBDA, and cannabichromenic acid (CBCA) includes alkylation of OLA with GPP which is catalyzed by geranylpyrophosphate:olivetolate geranyltransferase (GOT) (Fellermeier and Zenk, 1998). In the MEP pathway, however, the prenyl side-chain originates provide substrates for GPP synthesis which lead to the production of CBGA by an aromatic prenyltransferase (PT) [
