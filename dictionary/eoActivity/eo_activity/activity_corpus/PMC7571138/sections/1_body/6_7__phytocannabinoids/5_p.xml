<p>Cannabigerol (CBG) is one of the most important cannabinoids you have just heard about as the precursor to both THC and CBD perhaps due to its low concentration and rare trace. Indeed, it devotes itself entirely to creating THC and CBD so that we can get high and/or enjoy good health and aspirations. However, CBG is promising in therapeutic applications, although most strains often contain less than 1% CBG. CBG is found rarely in low THC and CBD hemp cultivars but probably not in THC-rich cannabis and CBD-rich hemp cultivars.</p>
