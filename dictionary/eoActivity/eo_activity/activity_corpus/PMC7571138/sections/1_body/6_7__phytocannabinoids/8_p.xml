<p>Phytocannabinoids (PCs) refer to those cannabinoid compounds synthesized in plants. There are two other different types of cannabinoids made in the mammalians called endocannabinoids (ECs), as well as synthetic cannabinoids (SCs) [

 <xref rid="B85-molecules-25-04036" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. The ECs, mainly anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG), mediate their effects through two groups of receptors designated as cannabinoid-1 abbreviated as CB1 and cannabinoid-2 that is known as CB2 [

 <xref rid="B87-molecules-25-04036" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. The ECs bind to CB1 and CB2 receptors with different levels of affinity. For instance, AEA has a high affinity for CB1, whereas 2-AG exhibits a higher affinity towards CB2 receptors [

 <xref rid="B81-molecules-25-04036" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. The CB1 receptors have been shown to be expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS), presynaptic and axonal compartments, and also at lower levels in some extraneural tissues such as the testis, adrenal gland, bone marrow, heart, lung, prostate, thymus, tonsils, and spleen, as shown in

 <xref rid="B91-molecules-25-04036" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. They are found in particularly high levels in the neocortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, amygdala, cerebellum, and brainstem [

 <xref rid="B94-molecules-25-04036" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. The psycho-activity properties of cannabinoids appear to be related to these receptors. In contrast, CB
