<p>Five chemotypes were defined based on phytocannabinoids composition, quantities, and their ratios to discriminate different cannabis varieties for different applications [

Of course, this is only a widely accepted agreement to determine the restrictions of cultivation in different countries, however, based on our recent screening program, we found accessions in our gene bank that have unique fiber anatomy but contain &gt;1% THC (CGRC, 
 <uri xlink:href="www.medcanabase.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.medcanabase.org</uri>). However, given that THC and CBD levels are more focused largely to determine whether it is a drug-type, fiber-type, or medical cannabis. According to this, a novel native cannabis gene pool was published recently at the Center for Genetic Resources of Cannabis (CGRC, 
 <uri xlink:href="www.medcanabase.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.medcanabase.org</uri>) with three principal chemotypes as follow: THC-chemotype I (high THC/CBD or low CBD/THC ratio, THC content over 0.3–20%, and CBD content lower than 0.5%); an intermediate-chemotype II (the concentration of both THC and CBD are in a ratio close to the unity mainly 0.5–2); CBD-chemotype III (high CBD/THC or low THC/CBD, has mainly CBD, an amount of THC lower than 0.3% to trace an undetectable level). Two other tentative additional chemotypes included chemotype IV which had CBG as the predominant cannabinoid, but also CBD was present, and chemotype V, which referred to a material with undetectable amounts of any cannabinoids, was qualitatively described by some authors. Medical varieties cover both THC and CBD chemotypes. The THC-chemotype, which may be termed marijuana, is defined as a psychotropic or medicinal type (based on THC level) and CBD-chemotype, which termed hemp as a “fiber”, “non-drug” type or “medical”.
