<p>Today, there are growing demands for compounds generally called “cannabinoids” with many diverse therapeutic and nutritional properties, and more and more people and patients from different countries are consuming such products either within the framework of a precise medicine or outside of this framework. However, the international community has not yet reached a consensus on cannabis and the multiple potential advantages; marketing of CBD-based dietary supplements is under intense debate in the scientific community. In recent years, however, the introduction of hemp as a valuable promising source with medicinal and nutritional properties and the emergence of CBD in medicine have somewhat alleviated these concerns. Hemp products can be used as a nutritional supplement for the supportive care of patients or even as a super food in times of crisis such as floods, earthquakes, wars, and quarantines. Despite all concerns regarding cannabis, nobody can ignore the use of cannabinoids as promising tonic, analgesic, antipyretic, antiemetic, anti-inflammatory, anti-epileptic, anticancer agents, which are effective for pain relief, depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, nausea and vomiting, multiple sclerosis (MS), cardiovascular disorders, appetite stimulation and reversing the weight loss in AIDS and chemotherapy.</p>
