<p>There are still many secrets in cannabis/hemp that need to be discovered, and this plant deserves to be nominated as a candidate to save humanity as a promising source of medicine, food, and feed in the difficult future ahead. Even though this review is focused on cannabinoids and their possible impacts on health, it also highlights the lack of data and a great gap between real cannabis values and public acceptance. In this regard, creating a worldwide network to gather all cannabis experts together as the “Cannabis World Union” is proposed to better think about this magic plant and to avoid sowing confusion whether in the medical and scientific community or in public society. This is exactly what we are trying to achieve at MedCannaBase (
