 <xref rid="B43-molecules-25-04036" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. These extraordinary organic secondary metabolites have a wide range of bioactivities serving as end products of metabolism or waste products, storage reservoirs of nitrogen, protective agents against predators and stresses, pyridine nucleotide cycle which supplies the cofactor NAD, and as the precursor of the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylcholine [

 <xref rid="B58-molecules-25-04036" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Different types of alkaloids such as choline, neurine, L-(+)-isoleucine-betaine and muscarine, hordenine and trig pyrrolydine, onelline, cannabisativine, and anhydrocannabisativine were isolated from roots, leaves, stems, pollen, seeds, and hairy roots [
