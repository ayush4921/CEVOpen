<p>Over the past decade, the scientific community and public society have increasingly accepted cannabis, specifically hemp, as much more than a recreational drug. There is still a lack of awareness and studies and much confusion in the distinction between industrial cannabis/hemp, medicinal cannabis/hemp, and drug-type cannabis. Hemp varieties contain THC level less than 0.2–0.3% of the reproductive part of the female plant at flowering. Various parts of the hemp plant, seeds, extract, and oil, and also the cannabis plant with acceptable lower levels of THC, can also be used as drinks, a perfect nutritional dietary supplement, or as a dry super food in times of crisis such as floods, earthquakes, wars and quarantines, and as animal feed.
