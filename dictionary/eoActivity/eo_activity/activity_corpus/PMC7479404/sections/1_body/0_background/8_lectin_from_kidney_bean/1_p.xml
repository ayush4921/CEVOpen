<p id="Par30">Aminou, Alam-Eldin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] also reported that the biologically active glycoprotein, a lectin from the kidney bean (
 <italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</italic>) known to agglutinate (precipitate) cells, induced structural changes in the 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> structure, suggesting that this and other lectins have the potential to act as anti-trichomonad agents. The lectin was also used as a probe against cerebral spinal fluid from patients in an enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA) to determine their risk of developing Alzheimer disease [
