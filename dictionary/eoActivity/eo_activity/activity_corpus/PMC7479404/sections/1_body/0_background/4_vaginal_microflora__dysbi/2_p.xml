<p id="Par21">A normal vagina is acidic with a pH of approximately 4 to 4.5 but can vary between 3.5 and 5. This acidic environment occurs because of the resident microflora. It has been reported that there are five predominant microbiota states or community types (CSTs) that have been isolated from premenopausal women. Four of these CSTs are dominated by 
 <italic>Lactobacillu</italic>s spp. The last CST (CST-IV), however, does not contain lactobacilli but rather the overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria i.e. 
 <italic>Gardnerella vaginalis</italic>, 
 <italic>Atopobium vaginae</italic>, 
 <italic>Prevotella bivia</italic>, and others [
