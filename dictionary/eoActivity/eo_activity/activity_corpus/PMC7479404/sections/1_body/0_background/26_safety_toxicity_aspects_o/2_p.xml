<p id="Par74">Here, we will also briefly mention highlights on the safety of selected anti-trichomonads listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. As mentioned earlier, the higher the value of the selectivity index (SI) of an anti-trichomonad in cell assays, the greater the safety. Cargnin, Vieira [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] reported a high SI for the anti-trichomonad benzopyran HP1 and a low one for uliginosin B. A summary of the widely studied safety of the anti-trichomonad potato glycoalkaloids α-chaconine and α-solanine by Elkahoui, Bartley [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] notes that because high levels of these compounds are reported to induce adverse effects in some cells as well as in vivo, it seems prudent to include safety assessment in any future in vivo studies. Kim, Nam [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] found no apparent adverse effects in mice consuming diets supplemented with the anti-trichomonad tomato glycoalkaloid tomatine. Some individuals consume high-tomatine pickled green tomatoes with no apparent adverse effects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">134</xref>]. The anti-trichomonad caffeic and chlorogenic acids and quercetin from potatoes and resveratrol from grapes are widely consumed safe food ingredients. The use of probiotics in the treatment of trichomoniasis in women seems to reduce the adverse effects of metronidazole [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. Finally, Zhao, Lu [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">135</xref>] reported that because the anti-trichomonad emodin prolonged the lifespan of the invertebrate animal 
 <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, this apparently safe compound might serve as an anti-aging dietary supplement.
