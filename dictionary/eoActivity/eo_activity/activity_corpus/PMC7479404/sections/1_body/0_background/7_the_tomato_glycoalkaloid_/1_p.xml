<p id="Par26">Liu, Kanetake [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] reported the following experimental observations on the inactivation of three pathogenic protozoal strains (G3, human 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic>; D1, cattle 
 <italic>T. foetus</italic>; and C1
 <italic>,</italic> feline 
 <italic>T. foetus</italic>) by the commercial tetrasaccharide tomato glycoalkaloid tomatine (a 9:1 mixture of α-tomatine and dehydrotomatine from tomatoes (
 <italic>Lycopersicon esculentum</italic>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and the aglycone tomatidine lacking the carbohydrate side chain. Under the test conditions, tomatine completely inactivated the three strains, whereas the corresponding inactivation by tomatidine was much lower for all three strains (3.2, 22.9, and 10.2%, for G3, D1, and C1, respectively). The calculated IC

  <italic>50</italic>
 </sub> values for tomatine based on dose-response data of G3, D1, and C1 are 7.9 μM, 2.7 μM, and 2.0 μM, respectively, which compares with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for metronidazole of 0.72 μM, 0.49 μM, and 0.55 μM, respectively (the much lower values indicating inhibition is greater). The results show that the feline trichomonad strain was the most susceptible to inactivation by tomatine. Unlike medicinal antibiotics, tomatine did not affect normal flora bacteria in vitro.
