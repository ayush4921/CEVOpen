<p id="Par33">Three publications by Sirk et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>] describe studies on molecular-dynamics computer simulations of green tea catechins and black tea theaflavins and lipid bilayers of cell membranes. The simulations show that the tea compounds have a strong affinity for the lipid bilayer; some are absorbed into the bilayer and some remain on the surface. The molecular structure of the compounds influences their absorption, as well as the ability of their hydroxyl (OH) groups to form hydrogen bonds with the lipid bilayer headgroups. Insight into these molecular events facilitates a better understanding of the mechanism of disruption of cell membranes in biological processes, including the anti-cancer, antibacterial, and antiprotozoal effects.
