<p id="Par24">Friedman, Huang [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] describe the inactivation, using cell-based assays, of the three pathogenic protozoal strains 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> human G3, 
 <italic>Tritrichomonas foetus</italic> feline C1, and 
 <italic>Tritrichomonas foetus</italic> bovine D1 by the potato (
 <italic>Solanum tuberosum</italic>) glycoalkaloids α-chaconine and α-solanine, their common aglycone solanidine, three potato phenolic compounds (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), and six potato peel powders. The two glycoalkaloids completely inhibited all three strains under the test conditions, with the following IC
 <sub>50</sub> values (concentration that inhibited 50% of the cells under the test conditions) calculated from concentration-response data: for G3, α-solanine 15.8 μM and α-chaconine 35.6 μM; for C1, α-solanine 12.6 μM and α-chaconine 51.5 μM, and for D1 α-solanine 10.9 μM and α-chaconine 35–60 μM. Solanidine was less active, inactivating G3, C1 and D1 to 48.4, 22.6, and 23.0%, respectively. IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were not calculated for inhibitory activities of &lt; 50%. Three potato phenolic compounds also inactivated the three strains. Caffeic acid inhibited G3 to 42.8%; D1 to 43.7%; and C1 to 21.1%. The corresponding values for chlorogenic acid are 11.4, 12.1, and 21.9%, and for quercetin 45.6, 18.9, and 18.5%, respectively. Additional studies found that six potato peel powders containing glycoalkaloids and other bioactive compounds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] also inhibited the three trichomonads. The percentage inhibition of G3 ranged from 1 (red potato peel) to 36.6 (organic Russet potato peel); of D1 from 9.0 (red potato peel) to 41.4 (organic Russet potato peel); and of C1 from 0 (purple potato peel) to 48.6 (organic Russet peel). Disc-diffusion screening revealed no effect on normal microbiota in the vaginal flora.
