<p id="Par48">Abdali, Jahed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>] used a randomized study of 420 women of reproductive age to determine the effect of a vaginal cream containing a medicine made from 
 <italic>Zataria multiflora</italic> (Labiatae family) against 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> vaginal infections and bacterial vaginosis that often accompanies the protozoal infection. The control group was administered oral metronidazole tablets. The results show that the cream is as effective as the drug in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.01) and clinical symptoms associated with 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001). The authors suggest that the cream should also be evaluated for the possible recurrence of 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> following treatment. A study by Sgibnev and Kremleva [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>] found that twice daily intravaginal co-administration of 500 mg metronidazole with 1 capsule of the commercial probiotic Gynophilus® to 90 women with 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>vaginalis</italic> for 7 days significantly increased the therapeutic potency of the drug (88.6 and 42.9% for trichomoniasis and 63.6 and 11.9% for bacterial vaginosis (BV) treated with and without added probiotic, respectively). The binary treatment also decreased the inflammatory response and the pH and increased the redox potential in the vagina. The authors suggest that these changes are the reason for the increased therapeutic potency. The binary therapy merits further study with some of the described highly active natural anti-trichomonad compounds and extracts. A new vaginal cream containing a mixture of extracts of 
 <italic>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</italic> leaves
 <italic>, Viola odorata</italic> root, and 
 <italic>Mentha piperita</italic> leaf completely inhibited 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>vaginalis</italic> strain G1 in vitro in the first 24 h, suggesting its potential value for human use [
