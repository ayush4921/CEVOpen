<p id="Par66">Two investigations describe photodynamic treatment as a potential new anti-trichomonad therapy. da Silva, Ribeiro Cde [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>] found that exposure of 
 <italic>T. foetus</italic> protozoa to light sensitized with an aluminum phthalocyanine tetrasulfonated photosensitizer efficiently killed the bovine pathogen. The associated morphological changes in the cells included membrane projections, nucleus fragmentation, endoplasmic reticulum proliferation, and cytoplasmic vacuolization, suggesting the possible value of the treatment for bovine trichomoniasis. Silva Fonseca, Alacoque [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">119</xref>] exposed metronidazole sensitive and resistant 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> strains to methylene blue as the light-emitting diode (LED). They found that light alone was ineffective, but the sensitized light inhibited up to 81% of the nonresistant and 91.1% of the resistant strains, respectively. The authors suggest that the effective photodynamic therapy offers great potential for routine use in women with trichomoniasis.
