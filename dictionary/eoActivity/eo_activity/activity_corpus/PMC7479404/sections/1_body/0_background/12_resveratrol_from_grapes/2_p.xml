<p id="Par39">The authors also obtained cellular and molecular evidence for the possible mechanism of action of resveratrol against the parasite, as indicated by the following findings. Resveratrol acted primarily as an inhibitor of the enzyme 120-kDA [Fe] hydrogenase (Tvhyd), upregulated the enzyme hydrogenosomal pyruvate-ferrodoxin oxidoreductase, and induced overexpression of the heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp 70), a protective protein found in the hydrogenosome of 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic>. The authors suggest that the deleterious inhibitory effect of resveratrol resulted from the inhibition of hydrogen production in the hydrogenosomes and changes in iron transport, causing a high degree of bioenergetic stress in the treated parasites. This mechanism differs from the antioxidative mechanisms that have been proposed for other multi-beneficial effects of resveratrol, including cancer [
