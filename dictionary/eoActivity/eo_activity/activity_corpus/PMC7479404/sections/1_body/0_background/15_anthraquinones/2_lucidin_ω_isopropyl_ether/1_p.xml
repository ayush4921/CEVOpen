<p id="Par52">Cáceres-Castillo, Pérez-Navarro [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] isolated and characterized the structure of a new anthraquinone (lucidin-ω-isopropyl ether) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) from the roots of the plant 
 <italic>Morinda panamensis</italic> and determined its activity against 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic>. The following methods were used to obtain pure test samples of the anthraquinone. The plant samples were washed under tap water and left to dry inside an oven at 40 °C for 3 days. The dry material was then ground to a 2-mm mesh diameter. The resulting powders were extracted with methylene chloride in a Soxhlet apparatus, and the concentrated residue was then fractionated on a chromatography column packed with silica gel followed by thin-layer chromatography. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) was used to facilitate assigning the structure of the anthraquinone derivative shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. The isolated anthraquinone, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 1.32 μg/mL, was found to be similar to efficacy to the metronidazole concentration tested (6 μM = 1.03 μg/mL). The compound was also subjected to a series of additional bioassays that showed it was highly selective towards trichomonad trophozoites and was capable of inhibiting their ability to kill HeLa cells and to decrease the proteolytic activity of the proteinase TvMP50 from the trichomonad that was associated with decreased expression of the mp50 gene. The authors suggest that the high trichomonacidal activity of the new anthraquinone merits further action-mode studies to define the mechanism of action.
