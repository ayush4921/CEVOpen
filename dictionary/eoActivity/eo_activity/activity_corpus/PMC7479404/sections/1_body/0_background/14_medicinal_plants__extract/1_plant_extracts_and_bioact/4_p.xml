<p id="Par44">Fernández-Calienes Valdés, Monzote Fidalgo [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] found that extracts of leaves and stems of 
 <italic>Scutellaria havanensis</italic>, a plant native to Cuba, and the isolated flavonoid compound wogonin (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) exhibited anti-trichomonad activity against 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> with the following selectivity indices: methanol extract 7.3; chloroform extract 2.8; wogonin 2.0; and metronidazole 322.6. Because antiprotozoal efficacy must have a selectivity index of at least 10, defined as the ratio of concentrations that measures cytotoxic to antiprotozoal activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>], the authors suggest that the observed activities are probably due to unspecific cytotoxic rather than specific anti-trichomonad effects. The test substance also exhibited activity in vitro against 
 <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> parasites, suggesting their possible value against malaria.
