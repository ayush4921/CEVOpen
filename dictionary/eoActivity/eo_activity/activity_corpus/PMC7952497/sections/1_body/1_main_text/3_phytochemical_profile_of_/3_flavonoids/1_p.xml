<p id="Par13">Flavonoids are the complex group of naturally occurring phenolics in plants, characterized by universal presence of phenyl-benzo-pyrone ring system. The flavonoids occur in free state or as glycosides (O-glycosides or C-glycosides) with its diverse derivatives like flavones, flavonol, flavanone, isoflavone, and chalcone anthocyanidins [

In plants, about 2000 types of flavonoids have been reported having antibacterial, antimicrobial, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, anti-aging, antiviral, cardioprotective activity, hence flavonoids are considered to be an important bioactive chemical constituent of pharmacologically reputed medicinal plants. It exhibits its anti-cancer activity by promoting apoptosis, induction of cell cycle arrest, proteasome inhibition, and by adversely interacting with carcinogenic enzymes [

Flavonoids acts as natural anti-inflammatory compounds by acting as potent inhibitor of transcription factors that modulate the expression of gene that produces inflammation inducer like cytokines, chemokines, and eicosanoids that results in inflammatory response by enhancing beta cell function of queretin-3-glucoside in diseases like, cardiovascular impairment, rheumatoid arthritis, leukemia, ileitis, sepsis, psoriasis, asthma, allergic rhinitis, and sclerosis [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Flavonoids produces antioxidative responses by acting free radical scavenger and chelating metal ions such as iron and copper, inhibiting the activity of enzyme like microsomal monooxygenase, glutathione-
 <italic>S</italic>-transferase, mitochondrial succinoxidase, and NADH oxidase because these enzymes are involved in generation of free radical species (ROS); flavonoids are also helping in protecting lipids from oxidative damage caused by free radicals [

 <italic>Hyptis albida</italic> contain flavanoids with hydroxy-methoxy flavones derivatives such as 5-hydroxy-7-4 dimethoxy flavones, 5-hydroxy-7-4-trimethoxy flavones, ermanin, nevadensin, and gardenin while in closely related 
 <italic>Hyptis suaveolens</italic>, the flavonoid content ranges in between 10 and 13% such as gallic acid, Ferulic acid, quercetin, chlorogenic acid, and rutin [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Many flavonoids such as apigenin, catechin, naringenin, quercetin, and rutin are known for their hepatoprotective activity and flavonoids such as hesperidin, apigenin, and aluteolin have anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity [
