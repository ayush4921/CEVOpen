<p id="Par37">When the viral particles enter the host cell, the viral envelope gets dissolved due to the acidic pH of autophagosome and viral genomic positive sense RNA enters inside the host cell. Replication and transcription of viral genome occur at cytoplasmic membrane involving coordinated synthesis of continuous and discontinuous RNA. The 5′ region of the SARS-CoV2 RNA that constitute the first open reading frame ORF 1a/b synthesizes a large polypepeptide, polypeptide a/b [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. These polypeptides are then processed by several virus-encoded proteases viz., chymotrypsin like-3CL

 <sup>pro</sup>-NSp5 and papain like NSP3 proteases into 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps) that constitute the viral replicase-transcriptase system consisting of helicases, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and other nonstructural proteins that are packed in membrane vesicles and involved in viral multiplication and assembly [
