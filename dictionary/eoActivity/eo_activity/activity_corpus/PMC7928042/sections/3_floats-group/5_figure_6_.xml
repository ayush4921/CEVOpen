  <p>Influence of inhibitors MI-1900 and MI-1907 on occludin expression. (A) An immunofluorescence staining of occludin in controls and in inhibitor-treated cells (50 µM) for 24 hours. HIEC-6 cells were cultured on membrane inserts for eight days and subsequently exposed to inhibitors MI-1900 and MI-1907. Cells were labelled for occludin by incubating them with an anti-occludin rabbit polyclonal primary antibody followed by treatment with Alexa-Fluor 546-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies. Scale bar shows 20 µm. (B) Quantitative determination of occludin levels after 24 hours treatment of HIEC-6 with inhibitors MI-1900 and MI-1907 at 50 µM. The data show mean occludin concentration values in ng/mL units ± SDs. There were no differences in occludin levels between control and MI-treated HIEC-6 (

Cells were labelled for occludin by incubating them with an anti-occludin rabbit polyclonal primary antibody followed by treatment with Alexa-Fluor 546-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies. Scale bar shows 30 µm. (D) Quantitative determination of occludin levels after 24 hours treatment of PHH with inhibitors MI-1900 and MI-1907 at 50 µM. The data show mean occludin concentration values in ng/mL units ± SDs. There were no differences in occludin levels between control and MI-treated PHH (
