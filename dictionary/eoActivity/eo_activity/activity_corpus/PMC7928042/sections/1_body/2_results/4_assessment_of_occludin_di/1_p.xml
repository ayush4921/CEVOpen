<p>Localisation of occludin in TJ assembly was assessed in untreated control and in inhibitor-treated HIEC-6 and PHH using immunofluorescence staining. The cells were investigated 24 h after MI-1900 and MI-1907 treatments. It can be seen that the localisation patterns of occludin did not significantly change by continuous inhibitor administration on neither type of cell (
