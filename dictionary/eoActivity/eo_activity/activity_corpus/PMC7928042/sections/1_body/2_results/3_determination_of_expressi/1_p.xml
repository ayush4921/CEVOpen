<p>To assess the pro-inflammatory IL-6 and IL-8 levels of HIEC-6 and PHH after 24 h treatment with inhibitors MI-1900 or MI-1907 at a concentration of 50 µM, human IL-6 and IL-8 sandwich ELISA methods were used. At the used concentration, inhibitor MI-1900 and MI-1907 did not cause significant changes in IL-6 (
