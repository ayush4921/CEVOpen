<p>HIEC-6 and PHH were incubated with inhibitors MI-1900 or MI-1907 at 50 µM for 24 h. Cells were fixed with 100% methanol (MeOH, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) for 10 min and stained on the membrane inserts. Then, both of the cells were blocked for 20 min at room temperature in bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer supplemented with 5% BSA (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Sections were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in presence of anti-occludin rabbit polyclonal primary antibody (1:200, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The antibodies were previously diluted in 5% BSA solutions. Then, the inserts were incubated with Alexa-Fluor 546-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (1:200, Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), which were diluted in PBS. The sialic acid residues in HIEC-6 and PHH cell membrane were stained with wheat germ agglutinin conjugated with Alexa-Fluor 488 (1:200 diluted in PBS, WGA Alexa Fluor 488, Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) for 10 min and cell nuclei were stained in blue using 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (1:500 diluted in PBS, Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) for additional 10 min. Between incubations, the inserts were washed in PBS for 3 × 5 min. Inserts were fixed on glass slides using fluorescent mounting medium (Dako, Agilent Technologies, Glostrup, Denmark). The occludin localisation was analysed using a Zeiss confocal microscope 63x Plan Apochromat 63x/1.4 Oil DIC M27 (Zeiss LSM 710 Confocal Microscope, Oberkochen, Germany).</p>
