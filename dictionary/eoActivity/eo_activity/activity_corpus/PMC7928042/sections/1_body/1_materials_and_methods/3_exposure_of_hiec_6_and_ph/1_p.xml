<p>For the experiments, four different Phe(3-Am)-derived inhibitors, MI-463, MI-482, MI-1900, and MI-1907 were used, and their structures are summarised in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>. 10 mM stock solutions in dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) were prepared and kept at −20 °C. Before treatment, confluent HIEC-6 and PHH were washed twice with plain (serum-free) medium. The solutions of the inhibitors further diluted in plain medium at 5, 20, 50, and 100 µM were prepared freshly from the stock solutions prior to each experiment. After incubation of the cells with the inhibitors for 24 h, the cells were washed twice with plain medium before being subjected to the subsequent procedures.
