<p>The quantification of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> concentrations in cell supernatants was carried out using the Amplex Red Hydrogen Peroxide Assay Kit (Invitrogen, Molecular Probes, Waltham, MA). In the presence of horse radish peroxidase, Amplex Red reagent reacts with H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (in 1:1 stoichiometry) to produce a red fluorescent product called resorufin. Following the exposure of HIEC-6 and PHH to MI-1900 and MI-1907 (50 µM, 24 h), the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> concentrations in the medium were determined using a working solution of 100 µM Amplex Red and 0.2 U/mL HRP. After 24 h, cell free supernatants were taken from the basolateral compartment. Fifty microlitres of the collected cell free supernatants were mixed with the Amplex Red working solutions. The fluorescence intensities were measured with a fluorometer (Victor X2 2030, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) using 560 nm excitation and 590 nm emission wavelengths.
