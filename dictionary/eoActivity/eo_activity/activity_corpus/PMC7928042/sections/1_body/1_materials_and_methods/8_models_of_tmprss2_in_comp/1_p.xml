<p>The homology model of TMPRSS2 was generated with SWISS-MODEL (

 </xref> and is based on the crystal structure of human plasma kallikrein (PDB: 2ANY). For inhibitor MI-1900, the homology model was superimposed with the crystal structure of a structurally related Phe(3-Am)-derived inhibitor in thrombin (PDB: 4E7R

 </xref>). Afterwards, thrombin was deleted and the original inhibitor MI-432 was converted into the structures of analogs MI-1900 and MI-1907 using the builder function of the software Molecular Operating Environment (MOE, version 2019, Chemical Computing Group, Montreal, Canada), followed by an energy minimisation of the complexes using MOE.
