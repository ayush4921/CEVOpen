<p>IL-6 and IL-8 concentrations were determined in HIEC-6 cell free supernatants and PHH supernatants using human IL-6 and IL-8 sandwich ELISA kits (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). To elucidate the cytokine levels after 24 h treatment, the supernatants were treated according to the instructions of the manufacturer and absorbances were measured with an EZ Read Biochrom 400 microplate reader (Biochrom, Cambridge, UK) at 450 nm.</p>
