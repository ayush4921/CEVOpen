<p>It was also proven that MI-1900 and MI-1907 did not generate inflammatory responses in PHH; however, these inhibitors induced oxidative stress at 50 µM. Based on our findings, HIEC-6 appeared to be appropriate

In accordance, the broad-spectrum inhibitors of numerous trypsin-like serine proteases did not cause enhanced extracellular hydrogen peroxide production even at 50 µM in IPEC-J2 cells
