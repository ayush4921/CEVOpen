<p>In our previous work, the inhibition of TMPRSS2 in IPEC-J2 cells via administration of the structurally related inhibitor MI-432 was detected at protein level using Western blot analysis. Under denaturing conditions of the electrophoresis the activated serine protease domain (28 kDa) was absent and a decrease in 62 kDa truncated fragment was also observed when the cells were incubated with this inhibitor at 50 µM for 48 h. Decreased tryptic activity was also measured 48 h after treatment with MI-432 in cell supernatants. It was also ascertained that exposure of IPEC-J2 cells to MI-432 at 10, 25, and 50 µM concentrations for 48 h could reduce the membrane presence of TMPRSS2
