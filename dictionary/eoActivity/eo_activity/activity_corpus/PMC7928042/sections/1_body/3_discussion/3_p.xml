<p>Intestinal epithelium takes part in protection of the host organism against damaging external xenobiotics. Pancreatic digestive serine proteases including trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase could elicit TERs of polarised monolayers for three intestinal epithelial cell lines such as nontumourigenic canine SCBN and human colon adenocarcinoma, Caco-2 and T84. In addition, treatment with these serine proteases increased localisation of occludin into the cell junctional complex presumably mediated by activation of PKCzeta
