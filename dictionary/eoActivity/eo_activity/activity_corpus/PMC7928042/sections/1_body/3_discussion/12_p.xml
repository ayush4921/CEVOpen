<p>Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), IL-6, IL-8 levels were previously studied to elucidate inflammatory responses in HIEC-6 after exposure of IL-17 and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)

Using MI-1900 and MI-1907, the extracellular hydrogen-peroxide production and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-8 were monitored and it was confirmed that both compounds at 50 µM did not induce excessive oxidative or inflammatory responses in HIEC-6 similarly to other Phe(3-Am)-derived inhibitors such as MI-460 and 461 in hepatocytes-based cell cultures
