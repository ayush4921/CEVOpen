<p>The impact of several Phe(3-Am)-derived inhibitors was investigated on porcine intestinal epithelial cell line, IPEC-J2, hepatocyte mono- and hepatocyte-Kupffer cell co-cultures. It was found that 50 µM MI-432, 441, 460, and 461 did not exert any detrimental effects on cell viability of hepatocyte–Kupffer cell co-cultures
