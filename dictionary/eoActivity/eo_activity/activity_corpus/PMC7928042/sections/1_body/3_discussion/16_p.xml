 </xref> found decreased SARS-CoV-2 titres in a dose-dependent manner after treatment with the Phe(3-Am)-derived inhibitors MI-432 and MI-1900, most likely via an inhibition of TMPRSS2. A five times and 25 times reduction in virus titres were obtained using inhibitor MI-1900 and MI-1907 at 50 µM, respectively. Experiments using HEK293 cells cotransfected with pCAGGS-S-Myc-6xHIS and pCAGGS-TMPRSS2 suggested that S cleavage at the S2′ site is only caused by TMPRSS2 and the combination with inhibitors of the proprotein convertase furin such as compound MI-1851, further enhanced the inhibition of the S protein activation at its S1/S2 site, which is activated by furin.
