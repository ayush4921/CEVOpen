 </xref> demonstrated that both TMPRSS2 and furin are responsible for S activation of SARS-CoV-2 in human Calu-3 airway epithelial cells, but at different sites. It was shown that furin cleaves the S protein at its S1/S2 site and TMPRSS2 at the S2′ site. Moreover, Calu 3 cells inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 at low multiplicity of infection (MOI) showed only small foci of infection if they were previously exposed to antisense peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PPMO) leading to knockdown of TMPRSS2 activity. Based on these data, it was ascertained that TMPRSS2 as host cell factor is a prerequisite for SARS-CoV-2 activation and replication in Calu-3 cells and inhibition of TMPRSS2 activity could successfully block viral infectivity. A similar effect was found in vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotype particles bearing the S protein of the SARS-CoV-2

 </xref>. These results suggest that non-toxic and biochemically well characterised inhibitors of trypsin-like serine proteases, like TMPRSS2, could be potential drugs for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Therefore, we characterised several inhibitors of the Phe(3-Am)-type in selected cells.
