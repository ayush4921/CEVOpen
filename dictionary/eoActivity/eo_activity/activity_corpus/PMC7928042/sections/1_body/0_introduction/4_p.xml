 </xref> proved that host cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 depends on the SARS-CoV receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) involving the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. The latter step can be blocked by camostat, a clinically proven inhibitor of numerous trypsin-like serine proteases. Treatment with camostat could exert partial inhibition of S-driven entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human colon adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cells and Vero-TMPRSS2 cells.
