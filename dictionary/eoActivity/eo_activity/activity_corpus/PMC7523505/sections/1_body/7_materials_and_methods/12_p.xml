<p>Ninety-six well sterile flat bottomed microtiter plates were seeded with these suspensions (100 µL/well) and allowed to adhere to polystyrene surface of plates for 2 h at 37ºC in a shaker incubator (75 rpm, Nova Instruments, Brazil), in the presence of different concentrations of 
 <italic>C. verum</italic> leaf oil ranging from 2 mg/mL to 0.0039 mg/mL (100 µL/well). Wells without oil were kept as growth control. RPMI buffered with MOPS+0.05% Tween 80 was added to negative control wells. 120 mg/mL chlorhexidine digluconate in RPMI 1640 buffered with MOPS (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was used as positive control.
