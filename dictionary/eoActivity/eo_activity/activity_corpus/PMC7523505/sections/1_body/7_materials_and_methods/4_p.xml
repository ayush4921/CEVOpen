 <italic>Chemical analysis of the EO</italic> - The chemical analysis of 
 <italic>C. verum</italic> EO was performed using HP-6890 (Agilent, USA) gas chromatograph coupled with HP-5975 (Agilent, USA) selective mass detector; HP-5MS Capillary Column (30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 µm); temperatures: injector (220ºC), detector (250ºC), column (60ºC), 3ºC/min, 240ºC; flow rate of carrier gas (highly dried He) of 1.0 mL/min
