<p>After 2 h incubation, wells were washed with 200 µL sterile normal saline in order to remove non-adherent cells. Attached cells in each well were quantified using XTT metabolic assay. Briefly, 80 μL of XTT [2,3-Bis-(2-Methoxy-4-Nitro-5-Sulfophenyl)-2H-Tetrazolium-5-Carboxanilide, Sigma-Aldrich] and menadione (Sigma-Aldrich) solution (4 µL of menadione in 10 mL XTT) was added to each well and plates were then covered with a piece of aluminium paper to protect from light and incubated for 2 h at 37
 <sup>º</sup>C. Then, the absorbance of resulting solution was measured at 490 nm using microtiter plate reader /Versa MAX, molecular Devices, USA.
