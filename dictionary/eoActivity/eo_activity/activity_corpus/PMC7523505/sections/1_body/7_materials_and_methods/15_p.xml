 <italic>Effect on germ tube formation</italic> - The formation of germ tubes from blastoconidia is the first step in the development of true hyphae and the ability to switch between morphological forms has been suggested as a potential virulence factor. Compared to the unicellular blastoconidial form, hyphae have an increased ability to adhere to and penetrate host tissues.
