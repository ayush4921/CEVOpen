 <italic>In-vivo toxicity of C. verum leaf oil (G. mellonella larvae)</italic> - 
 <italic>In-vivo</italic> toxicity of 
 <italic>C. verum</italic> leaf EO was evaluated by using 
 <italic>in-vivo G. mellonella</italic> larvae model after treatment with different concentrations of EO. 100% survival of the treated larvae was observed at all concentrations tested (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 16.0, 32.0, 64.0, 128.0, 250.0, 500.0, 1000.0 mg/mL) throughout whole experiment period (5 d) which indicates the non-toxicity of 
 <italic>C. verum</italic> leaf EO on experimental model (
