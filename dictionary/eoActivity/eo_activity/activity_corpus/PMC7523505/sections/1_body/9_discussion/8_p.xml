<p>Though, the effect of 
 <italic>C. verum</italic> oil on 
 <italic>Candida</italic> biofilm formation is not well studied, few studies were conducted by various scientists to evaluate the efficacy of Cinnamon oil on virulence and biofilm depletion of different bacterial species. Kalia et al.
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>36</sup>
 </xref> in 2015 studied the anti-quorum sensing activity of cinnamon oil against 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> by measuring the inhibition of biofilm formation and other quorum sensing (QS) associated virulence factors such as proteolytic enzyme production and swarming activity and effective biofilm reduction and antagonist effect on QS. Further, Erfan and Marouf in 2019 observed a downregulation of virulence genes of respiratory bacterial pathogens (
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Avibacterium paragallinarum</italic> and 
 <italic>Pasteurella multocida</italic> etc.) by cinnamon oil. They suggested the possible use of cinnamon oil for the control of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections instead of the routine antibiotics.
