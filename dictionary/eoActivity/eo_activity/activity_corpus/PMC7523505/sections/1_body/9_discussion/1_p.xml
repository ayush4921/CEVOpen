 <italic>Candida</italic> spp. displays many virulent factors that contribute to successfully colonise in host tissues. Adhesion to host surfaces (which is the initial step of biofilm formation), germ tube formation, biofilm formation, secretion of proteinases and other hydrolytic enzymes and aldehyde production are some of them.

 </xref> Phytomedicinal therapeutics is becoming more popular in modern word because of the high occurrence of the antimicrobial resistance and increased virulence of microbial pathogens.

 </xref> This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of such plant derived antimicrobial agent, 
 <italic>C. verum</italic> leaf EO on controlling the virulence mechanisms of the most common human fungal pathogen, 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp. Further the toxicity on 
 <italic>in-vivo</italic> laboratory experiment model, 
 <italic>G. melonella</italic> larvae was also evaluated.
