<p>When considering chlorhexidine digluconate, it exhibited the similar effect as 
 <italic>C. verum</italic> leaf oil (damaging cell walls of 
 <italic>Candida</italic> cells and cause cytoplasmic leakages). Further, according to SEM observations, chlorhexidine digluconate decreased pseudo hyphae formation of 
 <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> compared to negative control. Extracellular polymeric matrix that is characteristic of biofilms was not observed in any of the biofilms analysed using SEM since pre-treatments and electron beam of the equipment can cause the matrix destruction.
