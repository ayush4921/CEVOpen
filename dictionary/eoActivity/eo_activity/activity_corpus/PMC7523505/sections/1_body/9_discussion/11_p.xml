<p>The high occurrence and mortality rates associated with Candidiasis emphasise the urgent necessity for the introduction of new therapeutic approaches to treat candidiasis. Various studies conducted by multiple research groups has provided important knowledge about the pathogenesis of candidiasis,

 <italic>Candida</italic> and other infections. More effective and earliest option among them is the invention of novel anti-virulence approaches for the control and treatment of 
 <italic>Candida</italic> infections.

 </xref> Because germ tube formation, adhesion on to host surfaces and biofilm formation constitute the major virulence factors during candidiasis, they represent a clinically unexploited target for the innovation of such alternative anti-virulence strategies. In this study, felicity of a natural product, 
 <italic>C. verum</italic> leaf EO as a non-toxic, anti-virulence strategy against 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp. was identified using both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiment series.
