<p>SEM images were taken to understand the structure of the 
 <italic>Candida</italic> biofilms developed with the presence of 
 <italic>C. verum</italic> leaf EO. All biofilms of test strains exhibited reduced cell density, cell wall damages, cell wall deformities and leakages of intracellular materials with treatment of cinnamon leaf oil. Importantly, SEM images confirm the dose dependent nature of effects of 
 <italic>C. verum</italic> leaf essential oil. Fluconazole is the known antifungal agent which belongs to azole group and inhibits synthesis of fungal sterol, ergosterol by preventing the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol.

 </xref> On the other hand chlorhexidine digluconate is a biguanide which is used as an antibacterial mouth rinse. It alters the morphology cells and damages the cell wall of microorganisms and releases intracellular components. It has been suggested as a well-known therapeutic antifungal agent for oral candidiasis.

 </xref> Since both antimicrobial agents have an effect on 
 <italic>Candida</italic> cell wall, ultrastructure of forming 
 <italic>Candida</italic> biofilms with 0.25 mg/mL chlorhexidine digluconate (for 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>), 0.125 mg/mL chlorhexidine digluconate (for 
 <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> and 
 <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic>) and 0.008 mg/mL Fluconazole (maximum recommended 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assay concentration, CLSI) were also visualised. Similar observations were obtained with the exposure to MTC of chlorhexidine digluconate and 0.008 mg/mL Fluconazole. The intensity of the post-exposure response of Fluconazole was minimal due to low concentration.
