<p>Toxicological assessment of a natural product prior to its clinical application is an important aspect when the invention of a novel herbal therapeutic agent is concerned. The current study determines the 
 <italic>in-vivo</italic> toxicity of 
 <italic>C. verum</italic> EO using the 
 <italic>G. mellonella</italic> experiment model. 100% survival was observed with 
 <italic>G. mellonella</italic> larvae with all test concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 1000 mg/mL EO. This indicates the non-toxicity of 
 <italic>C. verum</italic> leaf oil on experiment model. Since 1000 mg/mL is the neat concentration (undiluted) of 
 <italic>C. verum</italic> leaf EO all dilutions including neat solution can be considered as non-toxic. Even though previous 
 <italic>in-vivo</italic> studies conducted on animal models have also highlighted lack of significant toxicity with a significantly high therapeutic range of concentration of cinnamon bark oil,
