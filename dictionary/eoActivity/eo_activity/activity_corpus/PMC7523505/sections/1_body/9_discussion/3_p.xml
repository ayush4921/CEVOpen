<p>Germ tube formation is another major virulent factor of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic> that enables the absorption of nutrients from host tissues by invading them. Effect of 
 <italic>C. verum</italic> at sub-MIC (0.25 and 0.5 mg/mL), both 
 <italic>C. verum</italic> leaf oil and chlorhexidine digluconate significantly reduce the germ tube formation of both 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic> whereas MIC (1.0 mg/mL) completely inhibit the germ tube formation of test strains. With time (for 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, after 2 h and for 
 <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic>, after 4 h) the germ tube formation in all groups including control group gradually decreased since produced germ tubes transformed to pseudo hyphae and hyphae. There are no published scientific evidences available on effect of 
 <italic>C. verum</italic> leaf EO on adhesion and germ tube formation of 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp. Current study was designed to find the efficacy of Cinnamon leaf oil on controlling virulent factors of 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp. in order to fill this gap of available data. Adhesion and germ tube formation are key attributes of infection causing ability of 
 <italic>Candida</italic> and therefore antimicrobial substances which interfere with these factors are considered as potential anti-
 <italic>Candida</italic> agents. Hence 
 <italic>C. verum</italic> leaf EO can be developed as a therapeutic alternative against 
 <italic>Candida</italic> infections.
