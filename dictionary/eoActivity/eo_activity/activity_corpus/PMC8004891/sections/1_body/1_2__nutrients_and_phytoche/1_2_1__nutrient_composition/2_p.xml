<p>The same nourishing richness is in

 <xref rid="B15-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] showed a higher protein value of 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> fruit (12.98%) as compared to black mulberry (10.85%), golden berry (9.16%), and strawberry (7.65%). Their great protein amount has proven their capability in contributing to protein’s recommended dietary allowance (RDA), which is 0.8 g/kg of body weight [

 <italic>M. alba</italic> fruits, while a higher ascorbic acid value was obtained from 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> fruit (22.4 mg/100 g) than the 
 <italic>M. rubra</italic> species (19.4 mg/100 g) [
