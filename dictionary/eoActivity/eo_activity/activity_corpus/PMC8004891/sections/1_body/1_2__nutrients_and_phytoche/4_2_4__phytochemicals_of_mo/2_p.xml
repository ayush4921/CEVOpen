<p>Studies have shown that 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> fruit seeds were rich in carbohydrates, fatty acids, and protein [

 <xref rid="B52-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Yılmaz and Durmaz [
 <xref rid="B53-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] have successfully extracted oil amounting to 232–332 mg/g from 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> seed, while lower contents of 220–280 mg/g and 213.3 mg/g were extracted by Yao et al. [
 <xref rid="B54-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and Argon et al. [
 <xref rid="B50-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], respectively. Researchers have claimed that the seed oil contains high amounts of carbohydrates and protein, approximately 38–54.8% and 15–21.6%, respectively [

A high total tocopherol content of about 2031.20–2393.63 mg/kg, mostly comprising δ-tocopherol (1644.70–2012.27 mg/kg), γ-tocopherol (349.74–366.80 mg/kg oil), β-tocopherol (13.11–19.27 mg/kg oil), and α-tocopherol (6.60–12.35 mg/kg oil) were reported [

 <xref rid="B53-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. High antioxidative total phenolic content and total flavonoid content were also found in the seed oil. Moreover, the oil could be fractionized into mono-, di-, and triglycerides (1.47–2.05%, 3.25–4.10%, and 90.08–91.05%, respectively). The total lipids could be fractionized into the three major lipids groups: neutral lipids (92.97–93.10%), glycolipids (2.12–2.43%) and phosphor-lipids (1.85–1.92%) [

 <italic>M. alba</italic> seed oil was reported to be rich in essential fatty acids, including linoleic acid (75.83–81.1%), palmitic acid (7.96–9.51%), oleic acid (5.64–10.38%), stearic acid (3.45–5.01%), linolenic acid (0.41–80.6%), and myristic acid (0.07%) [

 <italic>M. alba</italic> seeds in oil form, it has a high potential, especially as a fat substitute in food and nonfood applications.
