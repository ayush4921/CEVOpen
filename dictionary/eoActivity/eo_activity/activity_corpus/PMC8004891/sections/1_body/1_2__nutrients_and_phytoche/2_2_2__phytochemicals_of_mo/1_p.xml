<p>Flavonoids are essential bioactive compounds with excellent antioxidant properties that are found in 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaves. Thabti et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] reported the presence of three newly identified compounds (kaempferol-7-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside, quercetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-rhamnoside-7-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside, and quercetin 3-
 <italic>O</italic>-β-glucoside-7-
 <italic>O</italic>-α-rhamnoside), along with 10 other known compounds (1-caffeoylquinic acid, 5-caffeoylquinic acid, 4-caffeoylquinnic acid, caffeic acid, rutin, quercetin-3,7-d-
 <italic>O</italic>-β-d-glucopyranoside, quercetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside, quercetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-(6-malonyl)-β-d-glucopyranoside, kaempferol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucopyranosyl-(1,6)-β-d-glucopyranoside, and kaempferol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-(6-malonyl)glucoside). These findings were supported by Sánchez-Salcedo et al. [
 <xref rid="B5-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and Memon et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. They found chlorogenic, gallic, vanillic, p-hydroxybenzoic, syringic, p-coumaric, protocatechuic, ferulic, and m-coumaric acids as the leaves’ major phenolic acids.
