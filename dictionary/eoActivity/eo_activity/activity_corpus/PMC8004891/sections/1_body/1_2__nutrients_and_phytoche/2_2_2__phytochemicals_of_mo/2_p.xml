<p>Several new compounds, including flavan derivatives (moracinflavan A-G [
 <xref rid="B26-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]) and 2-arylbenzofuran derivatives (moracinfurol A and B) were obtained from 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaves [
 <xref rid="B27-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The same significant phytochemical groups—alkaloids, phenolic, flavonoids, tannin, and terpenes—were isolated from leaves of two different maturities, with mature leaves containing higher 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) and secondary metabolite values [
 <xref rid="B28-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, only simple terpenes were isolated via pyrolysis gas chromatography–mass spectrophotometry (Py/GC/MS), possibly due to terpenes’ lack of a polar group, which makes them more easily volatile compared to alkaloids and phenolics. Further analysis with different pyrolysis temperatures might isolate more compounds from 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaves [
 <xref rid="B29-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Ultimately, rutin, apigenin, and quercetin were the three highest bioactive constituents among the major phytochemical classes of 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaves (

 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaves in five different solvents [
