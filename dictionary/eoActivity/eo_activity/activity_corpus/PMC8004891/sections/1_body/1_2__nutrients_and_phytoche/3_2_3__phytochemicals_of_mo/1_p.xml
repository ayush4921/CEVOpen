 <xref rid="B39-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] found a total of 17 phenolic compounds in the fruits, consisting of cinnamic acid derivatives (0.36–1.29 mg/g DW), flavonols (0.07–0.36 mg/g DW), anthocyanins (not quantified), and benzoic acid derivatives (0.81–2.33 mg/g DW); while caffeoylquinic acids (CQAs) lower than in the leaves were detected (0.16–3.62 mg/g DW and 6.78–8.48 mg/g DW, respectively) [
