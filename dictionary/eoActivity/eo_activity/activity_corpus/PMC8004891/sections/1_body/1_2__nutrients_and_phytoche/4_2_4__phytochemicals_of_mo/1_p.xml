 <italic>M. alba</italic> seeds alone are barely researched, as they usually are incorporated in the fruit analysis. The seeds are tiny in size and difficult to separate. However, the content of polyphenol in the seeds alone is currently becoming an interest to be explored. Lee et al. [
 <xref rid="B48-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] have found and quantified 11 polyphenolic compounds in defatted 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> seeds. These compounds are rutin (31.1–60.0 mg/100 g), 4-prenylmoracin (10.5–43.3 mg/100 g), quercitrin (7.2–34.2 mg/100 g), (+)-dihydroquercetin (13.2–33.1 mg/100 g), quercetin (15.8–19.5 mg/100 g), isoquercitrin (5.8–15.4 mg/100 g), chlorogenic acid (0.0–15.3 mg/100 g), moracin (4.7–7.2 mg/100 g), procatechuic acid (0.0–11.6 mg/100 g), and (+)-dihydrokaempferol and trans-resveratrol (&lt;0.1 mg/100 g). Meanwhile, caffeic acid (1.66 mg/g), 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (1.57 mg/g), rutin (1.54 mg/g), and cyaniding-3-rutinoside (1.30 mg/g) were the major compounds in
