<p>Calín-Sánchez et al. [
 <xref rid="B40-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] found 35 volatile compounds and categorized them into aldehydes, esters, ketones, benzene terpenes, and oxygenated terpenes. Moreover, the presence of bioactive compounds in 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> fruit, including rutin (293.5 μg/g), chlorogenic acid (226.9 μg/g), caffeic acid (17.2 μg/g), quercetin (15.2 μg/g), gallic acid (8.9 μg/g), kaempferol (5.8 μg/g), and apigenin (3.5 μg/g), has previously been detected [

 <xref rid="B42-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], three new compounds were isolated: (2S,2″S)-2,3,8,9-tetrahydro-5-hydroxy-8-(1-methylethenyl)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4H-furo2,3-h]-1-benzopyran-4-one; (1″R,2″R)-4-(2-formyl-1H-pyrrol-1-yl)-1-(2-hydroxy-1-methylpropoxy)-butanoate; and (4′S,5′R)-1-[(Tetrahydro-4-hydroxyl-5-oxo-2-furanyl)methyl]-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione.
