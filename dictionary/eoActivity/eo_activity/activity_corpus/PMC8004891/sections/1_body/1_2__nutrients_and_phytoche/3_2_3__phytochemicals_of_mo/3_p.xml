<p>Zhang et al. [

 <italic>M. alba</italic> fruit. The fruit’s polyphenol composition was significantly influenced by their maturity stages. The brackish fully ripe 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> fruit extract contained higher total sugar and anthocyanins, while the ripe red fruit contained higher ß-carotene and ascorbic acid [

 <xref rid="B45-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] found that types of solvent influenced the extraction of phytochemicals. Ethanol (EtOH) extract was the most efficient solvent, as 18 compounds were isolated, mostly esters (96.32%), followed by dichloromethane (DCM) and ethyl acetate (EtOAC) fractions with a total of 12 compounds. The major bioactive compound groups in 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> fruit are shown in

 <italic>M. alba</italic> fruit’s bioactive-compound content suggest its excellent potential for functional food-product development.
