<p>There are significant knowledge gaps between 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaves and fruit regarding their working mechanisms, bioavailability, and biochemistry in the human body. Moreover, the multiple phytochemicals and bioactive compounds contained in different 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> cultivars, maturity stages, extraction conditions, and methodologies have produced heterogeneous data. This has led to difficulty in evaluating and standardizing their activities. For that reason, more suggestive scale trials with well-designed and uniform parameters will provide a substantial input in obtaining homogenous data, which would benefit further comprehension of the in vivo effect on human health of 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaves and fruit, including their bioavailability and biological effect against enzymes, pH, and especially gut microbiota.
