<p>There is limited information available on the application of 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> in the food industry as a functional food ingredient, despite its current presence in commercial products. Studies have found that 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> has promising prospects for functional food applications. Its flavonoids and phenolic acids can act as flavorants, food fortificants, antioxidants, preservatives, and antimicrobial agents against bacteria and fungi. In contrast, its anthocyanins could be used as natural antioxidative food colorants to substitute for synthetic colorant usage. With the wide variations of food, more studies on a broader range of foods such as frozen, ready-to-eat, or processed foods are necessary to understand the reactions and impact of 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> on other food ingredients, as the food system itself is very complex. In the vast food-application potential, research emphasizing the effect of processing and storing on the content and stability of bioactive compounds in 
 <italic>M. alba</italic>-based foodstuffs is needed for a better understanding of the bioactive compoundsâ€™ role and interaction in the food matrix to enhance food quality and properties.
