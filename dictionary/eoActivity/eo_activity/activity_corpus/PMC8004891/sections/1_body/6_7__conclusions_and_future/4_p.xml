<p>Additionally, in regard to the degradation of heat-sensitive bioactive compounds, microencapsulation techniques have been proven to naturally protect and significantly enhance 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> polyphenols’ stability and properties. This result could establish a factual basis for further study of their utilization in heat-processed products and better industrial-processing performance, thus expanding the application of 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> in various food products. However, integration into the industry requires scaling up from the laboratory scale to the pilot plant, and subsequently to the industrial plant, to produce a larger production scale to ensure demand can be met. Regrettably, studies on the pilot scale-up process for 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaves and fruit are still very lacking. This is possibly due to the difficulty of scale-up implementation of bioprocessing. It requires deliberate time, efforts, experiences, in-depth research, and high capital. Unsuitable scale-up factors, procedures, and parameters would critically influence product values, properties, and volumes, leading to undesirable energy and economic losses to a company. In conclusion, 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> indeed possesses beneficial biological properties and is suitable to be included as a functional food ingredient. Nevertheless, the exploitation of 
 <italic>M. alba</italic>’s functionality and properties within the industrial field are still scarcely explored.
