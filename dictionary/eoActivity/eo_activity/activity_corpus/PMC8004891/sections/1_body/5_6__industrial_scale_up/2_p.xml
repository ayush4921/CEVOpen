<p>So far, only a handful of the attempted pilot-scale studies were successful, while most of them require more modification and trials. In Flaczyk et al. [
 <xref rid="B149-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>], the authors obtained about a 4% lower 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaf-extraction yield than at the laboratory scale. The study also reported lower protein (by 13.61%), glucose (by 38.78%), phenolics (by 44.94%), phenolic acids (by 53.03%), and flavonols (by 11.36%), as well lower DPPH (by 35.72%) and ABTS (by 20.1%) activities. Nonetheless, at the pilot scale, they found higher concentrations of saccharose and galactose by 23.77% and 23.68%, respectively. These values were due to intermittent loss during pilot-scale processing, as well as the different extraction and concentration conditions between the two scales. Therefore, further analysis and determination of qualitative indicators are necessary for the optimization process.
