<p>Gang et al. [
 <xref rid="B150-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>] obtained a polysaccharides’ optimal extraction preceding data focusing on 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaves. This study concluded the optimized temperature, sample-to-solvent ratio, and extraction time via a Box–Behnken response surface design (BBD) coupled with response surface methodology (RSM). As such, extraction at 76.7 °C with a 1: 20.6 sample-to-solvent ratio, extracted for 1.87 h, was reported to produce the highest polysaccharides (105.57 mg/g), consistent with their predicted value (106.64 mg/g). A recent pilot-plant study reported the optimal extraction condition for DNJ from 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaves [
 <xref rid="B151-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>]. The RSM exploration showed the best DNJ extraction value (31.62 mg/g) at 79.2 °C with a 1:9.82 sample-to-solvent ratio for 1.46 h. The value was higher than for the small-scale extraction process. These studies showed that extraction-parameter optimization is crucial in obtaining the best outcome value, and that RSM or BBD coupled with RSM were reliable methods for optimization of upscaled extraction. The obtained data on optimized extraction of 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaf polysaccharides and DNJ can be used as a foundation for industrial applications of 
 <italic>M. alba</italic>.
