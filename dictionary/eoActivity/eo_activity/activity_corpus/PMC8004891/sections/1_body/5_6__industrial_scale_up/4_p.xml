<p>Sample-processing parameters aside, the equipment and types of machinery used at the pilot scale also affect the process and outcome. Komaikul et al. [
 <xref rid="B152-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>] found that both stilbenoid and mulberroside A from an 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> cell culture were affected by the usage of different types of bioreactors. The study revealed that round-bottom bioreactors could produce three times higher biomass than the flat-bottom bioreactor, though no significant difference in mulberroside A production was found. However, significantly higher mulberroside A was obtained from shake-flask cultured cells without an air-driven system compared to air-driven bioreactors. Meanwhile, the stilbenoid production preferred smaller air-driven bioreactors (1 L) with low aeration rates. In sum, the production of mulberroside A and stilbenoid in 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> cell cultures could be affected by factors such as biomass circulation, aeration, and endogenous enzymatic hydrolysis. Therefore, a study focusing on target-compound stabilization and reduction of aeration-induced negative effects would be a valuable approach for 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> at the pilot-plant scale. More studies and optimization of 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> pilot-plant processing should include factors of formulae standardization, chemical equilibrium, product-quality maintenance, thermodynamics, processing equipment, energy consumption, etc., to ensure 
 <italic>M. alba</italic>â€™s successful application at the industrial level.
