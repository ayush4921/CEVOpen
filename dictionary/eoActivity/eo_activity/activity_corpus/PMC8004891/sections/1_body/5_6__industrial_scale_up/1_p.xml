<p>The assimilation into industrial and commercial production involves a larger production size to accommodate market demand, thus the need for upscaling, which proceeds from the bench or laboratory scale to the pilot scale, and finally to the demonstration scale for commercial demand [

The bench or laboratory plant is an early-stage study that provides a sample’s successful assessment, clinical trials, and system parameters. This stage provides initial upscaling data and factors before following up with efficient pilot-plant production. However, the procedures and materials operated at a laboratory scale are usually not practical on a larger scale. The unsuitable scale-up factor, policies, and parameters often critically influence products’ values, properties, and volumes, leading to energy and economic losses [
 <xref rid="B148-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. The upscaling process requires deliberate time, efforts, experiences, in-depth research, and high capital before its successful implementation. These difficulties are the reasons for lower upscaling information than the same sample’s laboratory-scale study.
