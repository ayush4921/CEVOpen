<p>The toxicity of 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaves was previously determined in 4 weeks of oral administration of low (1%) and high (5%) doses to both male and female rats [
 <xref rid="B102-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Throughout the observation period, no disturbances to growth or organ weight, nor any effects on the biochemical, hematologic, or pathological examinations were reported, indicating the consumption of 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaves was safe. In an acute toxicity study, an intraperitoneal administration of 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaf extract showed a median lethal dose (LD
 <sub>50</sub>) of approximately 4 g/kg in mice and 5 g/kg in Winstar rats [
 <xref rid="B103-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. However, they found no significant toxicity from the same 5 g/kg leaf extract when orally administered to both subject groups. During the test, the only effect recorded was the depression of the central nervous and respiratory systems, which recovered within 15 to 30 min. In a subchronic toxicity study, 60 days of orally administered 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaf extract (1, 2, and 3 g/kg daily) showed no significant effects on blood chemistry or hematologic values, as well as no significant histopathological abnormalities in the major organs of the mice. There were no deaths reported in any of the studies [
