<p>Furthermore, an in vivo neurobehavioral study of 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> fruit (100, 300, 1000 mg/kg) showed no significant effect on the general health, metabolism, and growth of mice based on their alertness, body weight, daily food and water intake, and organ weight [

 <italic>M. alba</italic> fruit on liver. No indication of renal toxicity was observed, as the levels of renal-function biomarkers (blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, cholesterol, glucose, and albumin) were within normal ranges. The histological analysis confirmed that no morphological changes or internal injuries appeared, even at the highest oral dose of 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> fruit (1000 mg/kg) throughout 28 days, indicating the safe consumption of 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> fruit [

Therefore, to understand the precise mechanism of action, estimating the brain’s neurotransmitter levels is necessary, and could suggest the nontoxic effect of fruit extract on the normal growth of animals.
