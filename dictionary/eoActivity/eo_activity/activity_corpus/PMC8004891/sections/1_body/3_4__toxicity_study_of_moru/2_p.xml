<p>Throughout the 14 days of the trial, the behavioral signals and biomass of the mice were not affected by 300 and 2000 mg/kg of body weight of ethanolic

However, significant reduction of mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC) occurred in the 2000 mg/kg-treated mice. The MCHC of the 300 mg/kg mice was also lower than the control group, indicating the activity of leaf compounds on erythrocytes, leading to lower cell production. Both mice groups showed a lower proportion of lymphocytes with an increase of segmented leukocytes. The 2000 mg/kg-treated mice showed significant alteration in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase enzymes. The liver cells’ instability signal of the Gamma-glutamyl transferase level (GGT) was the same in all groups, which indicated the nonhepatotoxic effect of 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaves. Conversely, the 2000 mg/kg dose altered kidney and liver structure, whereas the 300 mg/kg only altered leukocyte proportion, with no toxicity or any irreversible cellular damages observed [

 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaves could induce biochemical, haematological, and histopathological alterations.
