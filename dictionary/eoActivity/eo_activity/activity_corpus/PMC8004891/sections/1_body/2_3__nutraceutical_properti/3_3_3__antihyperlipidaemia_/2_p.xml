<p>Ten compounds were found to have antiadipogenic activity, in which three were benzofuran derivatives, two were phenolic derivatives, two were flavonoids, one was an alkaloid, one was lignin, and one was coumarin. These compounds possessed 2.1–36.6% of antiadipogenic activity on 3T3-L1 adipocytes [

 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaves to significantly reduce the expression of the key regulator of LDL receptor, the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), was reported by Lupo et al. [
 <xref rid="B72-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. This report was followed with significant reduction of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-3-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) in mRNA levels of HepG2 cells by 51.1% and 37.2%, respectively. Whereas, at the protein level, expression of the LDL receptor was elevated by 1.8-fold. However, in hepatic cells, no significant effect on the PCSK9 promoter activity was found, despite its expression inhibition in both mRNA and protein levels.Both 5% and 10% 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> fruit supplementation have significantly down-regulated serum and liver thiobarbituric-acid-related substances (TBARS) in mice [
 <xref rid="B73-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. In contrast, a significant increment of red blood cells, liver superoxide dismutase, and blood glutathione peroxidase levels only occurred in 10% fruit-supplemented mice. The fluctuated HDL-C and LDL-C in high-fat animals were claimed to be contributed by the total anthocyanin (0.0087%) and flavonoid (0.39%) contents in the fruit [

 <italic>M. alba</italic> fruit to manage hyperlipidaemia. In another study, 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> fruit modulated obesity-induced cardiac dysfunction by inhibiting lipogenesis and fibrosis, and enhancing lipolysis in high-fat diet-induced obesity [
 <xref rid="B74-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Fruit extract also attenuated reactive oxygen species (ROS), vascular function, inflammatory markers, and lipid accumulation while reducing collagen in obese rats; these are considered factors for defense against and remediation of obesity-related cardiac dysfunction cardiac fibrosis. The chemical structures of compounds possessing antihyperlipidaemia can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00689-f003">Figure 3</xref>. To sum up, 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaf and fruit extracts contain significant obesity-repressing and cholesterol-reducing properties, making them an excellent defensive agent against obesity, atherosclerosis, and hyperlipidaemia-related disorder. Nevertheless, the active components’ mechanism to induce the uptake of LDLR and LDL is still unknown. Therefore, further study needs to explore a more profound understanding of 
 <italic>M. alba</italic>’s antihyperlipidaemia mechanism.
