 <italic>M. alba</italic> fruit also has potent antioxidative activities. According to D’urso et al. [
 <xref rid="B59-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], phenylpropanoids and flavonols were the two main compounds responsible for the fruit’s antioxidant activity. High total flavonoid content (187.23 mg/g QUE of DW) expressing strong DPPH (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.518 mg/mL) and FRAP (0.685 at 4.0 mg/mL) were obtained from 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> fruit [

 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> induced in mice. In addition, the inhibition of lipid peroxidation in the liver, microsome, and mitochondria were detected as 45.5%, 42.8%, and 39.4%, respectively. The total antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> fruit was similar to that of strawberry (39.40 and 51.31 mg Trolox/g of fresh weight, respectively) [
