<p>Natural plant extracts can ameliorate insulin production and inhibit intestinal glucose absorption, thus becoming a significant catalyst in managing diabetes [
 <xref rid="B63-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Ahn et al. [
 <xref rid="B64-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] supplemented 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> in diabetic mice for 14 days and found a significant reduction of plasma total cholesterol, hepatic T-C, and triglyceride concentrations. However, the 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaf-supplemented group showed the most significant activities, including decreased plasma glucose and insulin, and elevated levels of protein S6 kinase (pS6K), phosphorylated Akt (pAKT), and phosphorylated (p)-AMP-activated protein kinase (pAMPK). These showed that 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaves have better antidiabetic and antidyslipidemic properties compared to the fruits. Moreover, 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaf extract and oligopeptides (0.5–3 kDa) were found to create potent inhibition of both α-glucosidase and α-amylase enzymes [

 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaves contain 30–170 mg/100 g DW of DNJ, which is a potent α-glucosidase inhibitor that effectively suppresses postprandial blood glucose elevation with just 6.5 mg of its administration [

 <xref rid="B67-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] have isolated eight compounds containing α-glucosidase inhibitory activity, with chalcomoracin (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 6.00 μM) and 4′-prenyloxyresveratrol (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 28.04 μM) holding the most significant inhibition ability.
