<p>That aside, a two-week supplementation of 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> fruit extract could improve insulin sensitivity and reduce hepatic glucose production in type 2 diabetic mice [
 <xref rid="B68-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. The fruit-supplemented mice showed a significantly lower level of blood glucose and blood glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) (9.083%) as compared to the diabetic-control and rosiglitazone mice groups (12.921% and 7.454%, respectively). The fruit extract also significantly enhanced the activation of pAMPK and p-Akt substrate of 160 kDa (pAS160). Consequently, it significantly increased the GLUT4 level in skeletal muscles and decreased the glucose 6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase levels in the liver, thus suppressing the hepatic gluconeogenesis process [
