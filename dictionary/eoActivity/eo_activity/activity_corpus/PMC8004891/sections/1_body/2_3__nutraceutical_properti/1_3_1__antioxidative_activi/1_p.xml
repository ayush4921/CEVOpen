 <italic>M. alba</italic> is rich in bioactive compounds, and its flavonoids contain high antioxidative abilities, based on the analysis of different assays: 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS), and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) (

 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaves that possessed high scavenging activity in DPPH (322.67–876.92 μg/mL), ABTS (141.29–256.59 μg/mL), nitric oxide (5.11–176.38 μg/mL), and FRAP (24.32–258.99 AAE/g). The isolated peptides showed values of 169.55–328.57 μg/mL in ferrous ion chelation and 202.3–315.5 μg/mL in malondialdehyde (MDA) inhibition, which is important in hindering the production of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals.
