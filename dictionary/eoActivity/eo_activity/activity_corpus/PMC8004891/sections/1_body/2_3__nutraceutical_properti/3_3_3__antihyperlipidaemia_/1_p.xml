<p>Studies have found that the

 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaves to work directly on visceral fat mass and attenuated their adiposity and derangements. The abilities of 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaves in suppressing obesity, reducing visceral adiposity, and cardiometabolic alteration was accredited to their polyphenols, particularly chlorogenic acid, quercetin, caffeic acid, rutin, and kaempferol [
