<p>According to Gupta et al. [

 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaves could facilitate gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transmission, thus exhibiting an anticonvulsant ability in rats [

 <italic>M. alba</italic> leavesâ€™ significant antiepileptic activity at 200 and 400 mg/kg at 6.8 and 3.16 s, respectively, was observed by Rayam et al. [
