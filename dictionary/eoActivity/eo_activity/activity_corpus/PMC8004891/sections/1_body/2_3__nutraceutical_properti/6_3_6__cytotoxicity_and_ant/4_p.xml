<p>A newly found indole acetic acid derivative from 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> fruit revealed dose-dependent cytotoxicity on HeLa cells. The apoptosis mechanism was deduced via the death-receptor-mediated extrinsic pathway and mitochondria-mediated intrinsic path owing to the activation of caspase-8 and -9 [

 <xref rid="B101-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>] observed that the leaves exhibited only a slightly better cytotoxicity effect on colon cancer cells as compared to fruit, despite their higher total phenolics, total flavonoids, and antioxidants. However, a nearly similar cytotoxicity effect as the fruit was exerted on liver hepatocellular cells. Many studies have reported 
 <italic>M. alba</italic>â€™s multidirectional mechanism of action, which consists of eliminating reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and reducing the number of negative mutations and inflammation, while promoting apoptosis and activating the immune system. However, further investigations on in vivo studies of 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> cytotoxicity are suggested to be conducted on more aggressive and metastatic cancers or late-stage cancers, thus giving a better chance for advanced-stage cancer patients.
