<p>In the context of Alzheimer’s disease, a 28 day administration of 100 mg/kg ethanolic 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaves enhanced both learning and memory function in spatial-memory-impaired rats, whereas the 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg extracts inhibited memory impairment [
 <xref rid="B78-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. A high dose (160 mg/kg daily) administration of DNJ could improve cognitive impairment, alleviate Aβ deposition in the hippocampus through β-secretase 1 (BACE1) inhibition, and reduce the expression of brain inflammatory factors such as TNF-α, IL1β, and IL-6 in mice [
 <xref rid="B79-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. DNJ minimizes the decline of brain-derived neurotrophic factor/tyrosine kinase receptor (BDNF/TrkB) signal pathway in mouse hippocampus. This therefore implies its ability in improving the hippocampal neuron microenvironment [

 <italic>M. alba</italic> fruit extract, including improved spatial memory and learning aptitude and decreased neuron apoptosis and Aβ plaques in mice hippocampus and cortex tissues were reported [

 <italic>M. alba</italic> fruit also increased anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4) and reduced astrocytes and proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) in both hippocampus and cortex. Thus, it alleviated neuroinflammation [

 <italic>M. alba</italic> fruit extract has significantly reversed the AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> neurotoxin-induced alteration of striatum neurotransmitters and decreased 50% of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the brain. A significant increment in norepinephrine, epinephrine, 5-hydroxytryptamine serotonin, and dopamine neurotransmitter were observed in the treated mice [
 <xref rid="B81-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Based on these data, 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> could attenuate Alzheimer’s disease via Aβ deposition alleviation, inflammatory-factor reduction, and BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway alleviation, thus proving their protective effects on memory and learning abilities.
