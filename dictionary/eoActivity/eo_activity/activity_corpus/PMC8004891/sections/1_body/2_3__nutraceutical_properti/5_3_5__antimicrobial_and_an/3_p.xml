<p>On the other hand, morin isolated from

 <italic>M. alba</italic> fruit (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00689-f005">Figure 5</xref>) showed antibacterial activity against selected Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria: 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, and 
 <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium at concentrations of 500–1000 µg/mL [
 <xref rid="B89-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. In addition, methanolic and water extracts of 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaves were reported to be active against 
 <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B90-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. However, acetone extract expressed better inhibitory activity on Gram-positive bacteria, followed by ethanolic and methanolic extracts. In contrast, no inhibition was detected in any of the extracts against Gram-negative bacteria [
 <xref rid="B91-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. In another study, an attempt at biotransforming 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> fruit extract with 
 <italic>Lactobacillus brevis</italic> DF01 and 
 <italic>Pediococcus acidilactici</italic> K10 yielded effective antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium through the reduction of growth and bacterial-produced biofilm [

 <xref rid="B93-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>], DNJ derived from 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> fruit was shown to exert a positive effect against bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), GB virus-B (GBV-B), woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV), and hepatitis B virus (HBV).
