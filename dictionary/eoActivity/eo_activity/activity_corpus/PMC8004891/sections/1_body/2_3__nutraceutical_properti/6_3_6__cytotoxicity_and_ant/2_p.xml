<p>Interestingly, Fallah et al. [
 <xref rid="B97-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>] observed that flavonoids from 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaves could induce a more potent dose-dependent cytotoxicity in colon cancer, compared to the established chemotherapy drug doxorubicin or their combination (flavonoids + doxorubicin). Dat et al. [
 <xref rid="B2-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] found 10 flavonoid compounds exerting potent cytotoxicity toward HeLa cells (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.64–3.69 μM), MCF-7 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 3.21–7.88 μM), and Hep-3B (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 3.09–9.21 μM). As such, the top three flavonoids with the highest cytotoxicity for each cancer cell were morusin, atalantoflavone, and 3′-Geranyl-3-prenyl-2′,4′,5,7-tetrahydroxyflavone in HeLa cells; 8-Geranylapigenin, sanggenon K, and 3′-Geranyl-3-prenyl-2′,4′,5,7-tetrahydroxyflavone in MCF-7 cells; and sanggenon K, 8-Geranylapigenin, and atalantoflavone in Hep-3B cells. Meanwhile, a more recent study suggested 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaves had in vitro and in vivo cytotoxic activity on a number of compounds, including morusin, morachalcone B, morachalcone C, moracin D, moracin X, chalcomoracin, and DNJ [
