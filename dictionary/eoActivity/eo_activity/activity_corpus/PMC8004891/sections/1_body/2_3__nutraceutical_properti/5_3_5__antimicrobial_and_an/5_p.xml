<p>Based on these studies, the antimicrobial and antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaves and fruit have been demonstrated to be effective, especially against 
 <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium, which is a globally known foodborne enteric pathogen accountable for acute gastroenteritis associated with undercooked or contaminated foods. Moreover, a lack of antiviral drugs could allow 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> to be utilized as an effective alternative to prevent and control virus-related diseases. Nonetheless, further studies focusing on specific high antioxidative compounds and biotransformation are still required to support the antimicrobial and antiviral ability of 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> to better control foodborne bacterial and viral surrogates.
