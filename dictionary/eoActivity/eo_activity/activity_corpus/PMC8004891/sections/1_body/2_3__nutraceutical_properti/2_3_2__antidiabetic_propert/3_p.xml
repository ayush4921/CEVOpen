<p>A recent study reported 16 flavonoids from 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> fruit possessing α-glucosidase-inhibitory ability [
 <xref rid="B42-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Among them, quercetin (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 16.00 μM), kaempferol (27.61 μM), morachalcone (49.07 μM), and isobavachalcone (51.84 μM) were predominant, while the rest presented higher IC
 <sub>50</sub> values than acarbose (122.22 μM). The structures of these compounds are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00689-f002">Figure 2</xref>. The inhibitory ability of flavonoids is interchangeable based on any slight structural changes from the hydroxylation of the C-3 position of dihydroflavones, which significantly increased the α-glucosidase-inhibitory ability of (2R)-eriodictyol (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 168.72 μM) as compared to (2R, 3R)-dihydroquercetin (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 348.12 μM) [

 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaves and fruit contain high α-glucosidase-inhibiting, antihyperglycemic, and antidyslipidemic properties, making them a positive source for diabetes treatment.
