<p>Mulberry species are well known as a source of compounds that inhibit the initiation and development of cancers. The primary anticancer protective ability is due to the number of antioxidants available in 
 <italic>M. alba</italic>. Several studies on various human cancer cells, including cervical cancer, lung carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer have been conducted to verify the anticancer ability of 
 <italic>M. alba</italic>. A study on methanolic 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaf extract used against P19 embryonal carcinoma showed the highest cytotoxic effect with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 273, 117, and 127 μg/mL at 48 h, 96 h, and 144 h of treatment, respectively, as compared to the other 3 plants extracts [

 <xref rid="B95-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>], leaf extract inhibited HepG2 proliferation by repressing nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) gene expression and modulating the biochemical markers alfa-fetoprotein (AFP), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gammaglutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GT), and albumin (ALB). Moreover, the leaves induced morphological changes in HepG2 cells to a more mature hepatocyte form [

 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaves, followed by the formation of flocculent apoptosomes at 150 mM and spherical suspensions of dead/apoptotic cells at 220 mM. This morin-induced apoptosis occurred via multiple pathways, including increment of death-receptor expression, mitochondrial pathway, the elevation of apoptosis-related gene expression, and ROS-induced apoptosis [
