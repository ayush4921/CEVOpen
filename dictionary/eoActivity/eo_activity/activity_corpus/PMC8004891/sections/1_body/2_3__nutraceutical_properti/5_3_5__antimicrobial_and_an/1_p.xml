<p>Over the past decade, the interest in plant-derived antimicrobial drugs has increased dramatically. Due to the high production cost and side effects of antibiotics, as well as their non-targeted mechanism of actions, various medicinal plants have been tested and showed positive effects on bacteria and microorganisms. Therefore, they are being used as a means against bacteria-caused diseases. Accordingly, 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaves were reported to inhibit the growth of 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescence</italic> [

 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. The extracts with the highest total phenolic contents could inhibit the three bacterial strains, verifying the correlation between the leaf extractâ€™s total phenolic content and their antibacterial ability [
 <xref rid="B85-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Thabti et al. [
 <xref rid="B86-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] found that the aqueous and methanolic 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaf extract showed antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> ser. 
 <italic>Typhimurium</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>.
