<p>Meanwhile, 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> seeds exerted an antiviral effect against the foodborne viral surrogates feline calicivirus-F9 (FCV-F9) and murine norovirus1 (MNV-1) [

The addition of 1 mg/mL of seed extract during pretreatment significantly inhibited FCV-F9 and MNV-1 plaque formation by 65% and 47%, respectively. Among the polyphenols, cyanidin-3-rutinoside showed the best reduction of MNV-1 polymerase gene expression. The significant inhibition of viral infection by 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> seeds in the pretreatment stage suggested their best effect was on the initial stage of viral replication.
