<p>Furthermore, in the area of different extraction solvents, n-hexane fractions of 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> fruit expressed the best cytotoxicity on HCT116 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 32.3 µg/mL), while dichloromethane (DCM) fractions expressed best on MCF7 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 43.9 µg/mL) [

Moreover, the DCM fruit fraction was safely recognized based on its zero effect on a normal cell line (Bj1), while EtOAc fraction afflicted 47.3% cytotoxicity on Bj1. Nonetheless, low to no effect was seen from the extracts on HepG2 (0–22.8%) and PC3 cancer cells (0–39.6%). This showed that a sample’s cytotoxicity varied with extraction yields based on the solvent’s varying polarity [

 <xref rid="B99-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>] showed that the cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) from 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> fruit could inflict cytotoxicity and dose-dependently increased human breast cancer cell death. 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> C3G’s active apoptosis occurred via elevation of cleaved caspase-3, reduction of Bcl-2, and DNA fragmentation. Moreover, 25 days of a C3G diet dose-dependently reduced the size of the tumor in tumor-transplanted mice. This proves their capability to inhibit the proliferation and growth of cancer cells in both in vitro and in vivo models [
