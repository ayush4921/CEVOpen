<p>Parkinson’s disease is a dysfunctional motor disorder caused by progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and glyphosate linked to oxidative stress [

 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaf extract’s protective ability could fight the neurotoxicity and harmful effects of glyphosate. At the same time, it attenuated the levels of lactate dehydrogenase, malondialdehyde, and protein carbonyls. Leaf extract also chelated free ions to scavenge H

 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaves are due to synergism or antagonism among the bioactive phenolic components in the leaf extract.
