<p>Moreover, 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> fruit extract also significantly improved and delayed the progression of Parkinson’s-disease-like motor and nonmotor impairment symptoms in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl 1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)/probenecid-rat group [

 <italic>M. alba</italic> fruit has inhibited olfactory dysfunction of rats based on shortened pellet retrieval time; amelioration of hypokinesia and bradykinesia, and inhibition of Gait dysfunction. Fruit extract also inhibited dopaminergic neuron degeneration and Lewy body formation through α-synuclein suppression, while amending the negative effects of MPTP/probenecid on ubiquitin expression in both the substantia nigra and striatum [

 <italic>M. alba</italic> fruit has dose-dependently prevented membrane damage, and conserved mitochondrial function and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) of the primary cortical neurons in rats when exposed to oxygen–glucose deprivation for 3.5 h [

 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaves and fruit. This makes them a promising nutraceutical ingredient to target neurodegenerative disorders, especially Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.
