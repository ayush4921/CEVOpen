<p>Meanwhile, in 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> seeds, stronger DPPH radical activity than L-ascorbic acid (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 31.5 μM) and α-tocopherol (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 52.3 μM) were revealed by rutin (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 20.2 μM), isoquercitrin (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 22.5 μM), quercitrin (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 24.6 μM), quercetin (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 27.8 μM), (+)-dihydroquercetin (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 28.9 μM), and chlorogenic acid (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 30.6 μM) [

 <italic>M. alba</italic> contains antioxidative phenolic compounds potentially useful as nutraceutical agents in functional foods (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00689-f001">Figure 1</xref>). However, temperature influences the contents of phenolic acids and flavonoids during drying processes [
 <xref rid="B60-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Therefore, studies using different drying methods, type of solvents, and extracting conditions that are more efficient and can effectively maintain yields, bioactive components, and biological activities should be pursued. Overall, the existing literature has evidently indicated the efficient antioxidative capacity of 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> both in vivo and in vitro, making 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> a promising ingredient for nutraceutical development.
