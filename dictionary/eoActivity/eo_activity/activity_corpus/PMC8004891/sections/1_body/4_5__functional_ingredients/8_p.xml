<p>In jam processing, the color quality of 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> jam was influenced by storage temperature. The 5 °C-stored jam possessed better color qualities (L* = lightness, a* = green to redness, b* = blue to yellowness) than the 25 °C-stored jam, but the difference was not statistically significant. In addition, during the four months of storage, no significant influence of light conditions on the quality and fluctuation of total anthocyanins and phenolic contents was observed [

 <italic>M. alba</italic> and its anthocyanins as a natural, functional food colorant, since it is safer to consume than synthetics and is capable of delivering enhanced color quality with value-added properties to the product. However, a study on this colorant’s stability in other foods such as jellies, puddings, or yogurts should be explored to reinforce the coloring efficiency. To our knowledge, no one has conducted further analysis of the antioxidant capacity of an 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> anthocyanin-containing finished product, or of other biological benefits, despite the proanthocyanidin-significant antimicrobial effects in the gastrointestinal tract and inhibition of sugar-, protein-, and fat-uptake-related enzymes [
 <xref rid="B121-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>], which are valuable in products targeting concerned about calories or their body weight. Therefore, such studies on 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> anthocyanins and their stabilization methods will determine their benefits as functional food ingredients.
