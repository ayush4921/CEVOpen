<p>According to Zhang et al. [
 <xref rid="B116-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>], 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaf extracts can prevent oxymyoglobin and metmyoglobin oxidation to maintain refrigerated beefâ€™s color. In addition, leaf extract significantly reduced the values of peroxide and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), and increased the superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities during beef storage, which suggested that mulberry leaves were able to reduce the lipid oxidation reaction. Nonetheless, 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaves are a good supplement for ruminants and pigs, as well as a good natural antioxidant to preserve the color and increase the quality and shelf life of meat, which are important in food industries. Further research is needed to find a suitable MLP dietary level with a lower negative impact on pig growth, and a longer observation period is required to find the maximum capability of 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaf extract on meat quality and preservation, to ensure the appropriate amount needed for the desired shelf life to prevent the food-processing industry from economic losses.
