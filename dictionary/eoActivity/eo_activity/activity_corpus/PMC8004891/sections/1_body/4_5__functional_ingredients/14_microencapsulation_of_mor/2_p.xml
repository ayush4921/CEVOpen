<p>The promising results for phenolic-compound recovery was strongly supported by the β-cyclodextrin microcapsule of MP, which showed optimal encapsulation efficiency at a core/wall ratio of 1:6 with ultrasound treatment at 450 W, 25 °C for 90 min. Under the optimized parameters, the processing stability of MMP, including the thermal, light, and storage stabilities, were significantly enhanced. Simultaneously, the encapsulation efficiencies of MMP for total polyphenol, flavonoid, and anthocyanin contents were higher than 97%, thus verifying the success of MP encapsulation in ameliorating the unstable properties of 
 <italic>M. alba</italic>’s polyphenols [
 <xref rid="B144-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. Gum Arabic and β-cyclodextrin are some credible encapsulating agents for 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> polyphenols to add higher nutritional value to food. The results created a solid base for further MMP studies on their natural-pigment and biopreservative abilities in other thermal-processed products when substituted for synthetics. However, detailed laboratory measurements with evaluations of color and sensory characteristics should be the focus of future studies. Moreover, the bioavailability of MMP and its synergistic inhibitory effect on protein and lipid oxidation in functional meat products must be further studied in larger-scale production to accommodate MMP integration at the commercial scale.
