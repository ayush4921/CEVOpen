<p>Furthermore, the investigation of 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> fruit’s polyphenolic compounds (MFPs) in dried minced pork slices (DMPS) revealed a dose-dependent antioxidative activity during processing and storage [

The MFPs effectively inhibited oxidation of muscle protein and oxidation-induced texture deterioration, and reduced the DMPS hardness during heating and storage. MFP also significantly inhibited aerobic bacteria growth on DMPS and masked the odor and flavor of pork. Interestingly, MFP-added samples during the storage and post-heating process revealed higher redness (a*) values as compared to the preparation-stage samples and the control group. Meanwhile, an increment not surpassing the control group occurred for yellowness (b*) and lightness (L*) [

 <xref rid="B123-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. A* and L* elevations were suggested to be caused by anthocyanin degradation during heating and storage. Simultaneously, the rise of b* value was attributed to the oxidation of ferrous heme iron induced by lipid oxidized products. The samples’ hardness showed a good increment, owing to the polyphenols’ physicochemical modifications during storage. Moreover, MFPs at 1.0 g/kg provided protection against lipid- and protein oxidation-induced damage, based on the lower TBARS and carbonyl contents, yet at a higher level of sulfhydryl than sausages without MFPs. Aside from the effective control of volatile base nitrogen (TVB-N) and microbial stability, MFPs also significantly reduced residual nitrite, which indirectly reduced the production of carcinogenic nitrosamine, causing MFPs to be trusted in biosafety [

In summary, MFPs are a promising natural antioxidant with effective protection against TVB-N increment, lipids, and protein oxidation, which could also effectively regulate Cantonese sausages’ biosafety. While this study can be used as a preliminary reference for research on other meat-based products, due to its slight unfavorable color defect, further research using the antioxidant function for better sensory and quality properties should be prioritized.
