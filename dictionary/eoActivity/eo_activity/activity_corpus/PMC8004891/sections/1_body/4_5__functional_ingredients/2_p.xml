<p>The antioxidative properties of

 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaves added revealed an increase in the dough’s protein levels, fat, ash, polyphenol, DPPH, ABTS, and Fe
 <sup>3+</sup>-reducing and chelating capabilities in a dose-dependent manner. However, upon frying, a decrease in polyphenolic compounds (by 0.16–0.21%) and DPPH activity (by 22–34.6%) occurred due to polyphenol degradation caused by heating [

 <sup>3+</sup> reduction (by 1.3–2.9%), and Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> chelation (by 247.5–4906.3%) occurred due to Maillard-reaction products (MRPs) that allowed metal chelation to inhibit oxidation [

 <xref rid="B112-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. Further studies on commercial-range parathas, such as the frozen and the ready-to-cook forms, are more convenient alternatives, and the cooking method should be revised to limit the loss of mulberry’s functional activities.
