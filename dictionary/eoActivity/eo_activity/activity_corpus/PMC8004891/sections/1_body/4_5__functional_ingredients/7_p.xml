<p>Currently, 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> fruit is used in cooking, baking, and for dessert purposes due to its sweet taste and attractive bright color that is ideal for sherbets, jams, fruit tarts, pies, jellies, teas, wines, and cordials [
 <xref rid="B19-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The utilization of fruit as a natural food colorant is derived from their cyanidin and delphinidin glycoside anthocyanins. They are reddish-purple to purple pigments that possess high FRAP and DPPH antioxidant activities [

 <xref rid="B119-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. Previously, Natić et al. [
 <xref rid="B119-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>] isolated 14 anthocyanins compounds with a total of 45.42–208.74 mg cyn-3-glu/100 g frozen weight, whereas a more recent study by Kim and Lee [
 <xref rid="B47-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] obtained 16 types of anthocyanin with total value of 0.95–28.61 mg/g DW. Among them, cyanidin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside and cyanidin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-rutinoside were the two significant anthocyanins in 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> fruit, possessing antioxidant anti-inflammatory properties.
