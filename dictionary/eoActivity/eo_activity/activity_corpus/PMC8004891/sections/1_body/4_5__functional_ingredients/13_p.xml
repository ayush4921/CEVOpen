<p>Leaf EOs aside, 
 <italic>M. alba</italic>-fruit-derived oil revealed rich fatty-acid contents, such as linoleic acids (58.89% DW), palmitic acids (12.46% DW), oleic acids (11.87% DW), and stearic acids (5.67% DW) [
 <xref rid="B136-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. Moreover, 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> seed oil revealed its high content of total phenolics, total flavonoids, tocopherols (1644.70–2012.27 mg/kg oil), and fatty acids such as linoleic acid (75.83–81.1%), palmitic acid (8.80–9.51%), oleic acid (5.64–10.38%), stearic acid (3.96–5.01%), linolenic acid (0.41–0.45%), and myristic acid (0.07%) [

 <xref rid="B55-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The high amount of bioactive compounds in the seeds contributed to its high DPPH (62–72%), ABTS (0.026–0.072 mmol/g), and FRAP (0.15–0.68 mmol Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>/g) abilities, which were proven by the strong correlation between total phenolic content with DPPH and FRAP (r = 0.965 and r = 0.951, respectively) [

 <italic>M. alba</italic> seed oil could be a good source of tocopherol and essential fatty acids, especially linoleic acid, an omega-6 PUFA usable as a blood-vessel cleaner to decrease serum cholesterol and inhibit arterial thrombosis formation [
 <xref rid="B141-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>]. Therefore, the oil derived from 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaves, fruit, and seeds contains many beneficial compounds and is potentially applicable in the food industry as a functional food ingredient. Nonetheless, one of the main complications in utilizing an oil is the quantitative or qualitative diversity of its compound content, which could cause variable biological efficacy [
 <xref rid="B142-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. EOs and oil carry a strong aroma, which might restrict their application due to the complex matrices and different interconnecting microenvironments of foods. It also requires a level of natural flavor complexes for adequate effectiveness that might exceed the organoleptic acceptable range, affecting the natural taste of food and human health [

 <italic>M. alba</italic>-derived EOs and oils are far from enough to solidify 
 <italic>M. alba</italic>’s potentiality in any industry. Therefore, further studies that isolate more of their compounds, and analyses of 
 <italic>M. alba</italic>-derived EOs and oils for their nutrition, biological activities, potential applications, effectiveness, toxicity, and stability in the food system are implored to solidify their place as functional food ingredients.
