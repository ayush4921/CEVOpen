<p>A recent study added 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaves and fruit respectively to liquefied and creamed rape honey to assess their effects on the enriched honey’s phenolic profile, antioxidant, and glycoside hydrolysis activities [
 <xref rid="B124-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. Rape honey is naturally deficient in polyphenols, but its antioxidant activity was enriched and diversified by 70- and 7-fold after the addition of 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaf and fruit extracts, respectively. A similar increment also occurred in 
 <italic>M. alba</italic>-enriched creamed rape honey. Furthermore, dose-dependent elevations of α-glucosidase and β-galactosidase were observed in leaf-enriched creamed honey. Meanwhile, in 
 <italic>M. alba</italic>-fruit-enriched honey, a slight decrease in α-glucosidase and a non-dose-dependent β-galactosidase increase occurred. The addition of 
 <italic>M. alba</italic>, especially the leaves, reduced about 50% of diastase, suggesting their inhibitory effect against carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzymes [
 <xref rid="B124-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. This is advantageous, as it slows down the loss of the diastase enzyme in honey, which allows longer storage while still containing a major amount of beneficial enzymes.
