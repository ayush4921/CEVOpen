<p>Essential oils (EOs) are plant-based aromatic oily liquids usable in several industries, including the food industry, as functional flavoring substances due to their health benefits. They are also integrated into food packaging to increase food shelf-life due to their antimicrobial and antioxidative activities [
 <xref rid="B126-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. Despite EOs’ increasing popularity, there have only been a couple of studies conducted on 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> EO compound constitution. Zhi-ming et al. [
 <xref rid="B127-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>] and Radulović et al. [
 <xref rid="B128-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>] found some volatile compounds in 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaf EOs with noteworthy biological effects. These compounds mainly consist of terpenoids, phytol, heptacosane, hexahydrofamesyl acetone, hexadeconic acids, β-bisabolene, carotenoid derivatives, and geranyl acetone. These compounds are used as food additives and flavor enhancers. For example, phytol contains antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antinociceptive activities [

 <xref rid="B131-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>], whereas β-bisabolene possesses a strong cancer cytotoxicity effect [
 <xref rid="B132-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>] and has a balsamic odor that led to its approval as a food additive. Heptacosane has been used as a nutritional supplement and sweetener to mend aftertaste [
 <xref rid="B133-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. Meanwhile, terpenoids are used for their medicinal, flavor-enhancing, and fragrance properties in various industries [
 <xref rid="B134-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. The same wide application occurred for carotenoid derivatives, which are also extensively utilized as a food colorant and provitamin, and as a fortifier to introduce its health benefits into food [
 <xref rid="B135-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. Nonetheless, no specific analysis of 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> EOs or their compound potentials have been conducted before. Therefore, further studies of their biological properties and applications as a functional food additive are needed.
