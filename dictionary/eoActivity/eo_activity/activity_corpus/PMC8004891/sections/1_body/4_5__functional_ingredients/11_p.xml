<p>The same compound enrichment effect was observed in 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> (leaf extract + fruit) added to baked bread (MAB) studied by Kobus-Cisowska et al. [
 <xref rid="B125-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. They reported significantly high total phenolic acids, flavonols, and antiradical activities in bread after baking and after 30 days of frozen storage. The MAB also revealed substantially high isoquercetin, chlorogenic acids, and protocatechuic acid. Respective positive correlations between the sum of phenolic acid and the sum of flavonols with DPPH inactivation, ABTS, and reducing the power activities were reported. These high values show significant 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> functionality in enhancing health benefits in foods for consumption. MAB also revealed higher sweet and insipid scent intensity, despite its grassier and bittersweet taste compared to the control bread’s sour and salty taste. MAB bitterness is due to 
 <italic>M. alba</italic>’s polyphenols, such as vanillic acids and ferulic acids, that contribute to a bitter, bean-like taste. Meanwhile, the flavonol glycosides affect bitter and sour taste. Despite the differences, MAB received a similar level of scent desirability with higher taste desirability, expressed via sensory profiling compared to bread without 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> enrichment. DPPH and ABTS activity, which expressed the continuous activation of the responsible antiradical compounds, was stable throughout 30 days of frozen storage in another study on MAB [
 <xref rid="B125-foods-10-00689" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. However, changes in the intensity of frozen MAB characteristics did occur; its sweet scent and grassy taste declined, yet its grassy scent and sweet taste intensified. From these data, 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaf and fruit extracts could be used as natural food fortifiers in bread, as they enhanced the nutrition level, bioactive compounds, and antiradical activity without negatively influencing the bread’s sensory and microbiological qualities. Nevertheless, they should have conducted a prior analysis on the dough’s bioactive compounds and antiradical levels in this study in order to know the percentage of compound and antioxidant-activity loss after baking. Despite the positive results from various studies, these data are still far from enough to solidify a food-industry function. A broader food-variety study, concise shelf-life of products, and analysis of 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> extracts’ effects, abilities, and best preservation of shelf-life are some aspects for further exploration.
