<p>For the ABTS assay, 7 mM ABTS and 2.45 mM potassium persulfate were mixed in the dark for 16 h to to allow the formation of the ABTS
 <sup>•+</sup>. Then, 100 μL of the ABTS
 <sup>•+</sup> solution was added to 50 μL of the prepared dilutions of mastic oil (0.00445–45 mg/mL), myrcene (0.004–40.5 mg/mL), and 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene (0.00435–43.5 mg/mL), while 10 μL of DMSO and 190 μL ABTS
 <sup>•+</sup> were used as the negative control. The mixtures were incubated for 15 min at RT in the dark and then the absorbance was measured at 734 nm using an Elisa plate reader (EnSpire Multimode Plate Reader, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). The % inhibition of the ABTS
 <sup>•+</sup> cation for each concentration was determined by making use of the following formula: 
 <disp-formula>% ABTS
  <sup>•+</sup> radical scavenging activity = ((OD
  <sub>control</sub> − OD
  <sub>sample</sub>)/OD
  <sub>control</sub>)) × 100. 
 </disp-formula>
