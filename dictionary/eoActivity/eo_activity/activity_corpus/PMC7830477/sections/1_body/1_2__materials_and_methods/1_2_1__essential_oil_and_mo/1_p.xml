<p>Mastic essential oil was extracted from the resin of the plant 
 <italic>Pistacia lentiscus</italic> var. 
 <italic>chia</italic> (also known as “mastic gum”) by distillation. Extraction of the oil and the volatile profile analysis was described previously [
 <xref rid="B17-antioxidants-10-00127" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The oil is a mixture of volatile monoterpenes and a sesquiterpene present at different percentages covering 94.12% of the total chromatographic area. The two most abundant monoterpenes are 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene and myrcene, accounting for 67.71% and 8.81% of the total chromatographic area, respectively (

 <xref rid="B17-antioxidants-10-00127" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Along with mastic oil, both these monoterpenes were included in the present study to analyze their antioxidant and cytoprotective potential. 
 <italic>α</italic>-Pinene (90–93%; 0.87 g/mL) was obtained from TREATT (Suffolk, UK), while myrcene (91–93%; 0.81 g/mL) was from TAKASAGO (Tokyo, Japan).
