<p>At least three independent experiments were performed for each condition tested. The values are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical analysis was performed with Graph Pad Prism software (version 8.3.0) (Graph Pad Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). The concentration of test samples required to cause an inhibition of free radicals by 50% (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) and the concentration of test samples required to cause a decrease of cell viability by 50% (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) were calculated from the respective dose–response curves by regression analysis using a four-parameter logistic curve using Sigma Plot Software (v.10) (Systat, San Jose, CA, USA). For all assays, statistical differences between groups were evaluated either by Student’s t-test or ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s or Tukey’s test. A level of
