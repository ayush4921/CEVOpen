<p>The human immortalized keratinocyte (HaCaT) cell line was purchased by the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA). The cell line was maintained in high-glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM l-glutamine, and 1% pen/strep (100 U/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin). Cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, grown as monolayers, and sub-cultured at approximately 80–90% confluency.
