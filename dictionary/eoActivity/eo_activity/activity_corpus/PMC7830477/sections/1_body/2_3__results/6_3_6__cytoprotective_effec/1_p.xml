<p>Mastic essential oil and its major components myrcene and 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene were also studied regarding their potential to protect HaCaT cells against a known oxidative agent (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>). HaCaT cells were seeded in 96-well plates and treated with 10 μg/mL of mastic oil, myrcene, or 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene for 24 h. Then, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with culture media with or without 0.2 mM H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> for 24 h. Following H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> treatment, cell viability was determined via SRB assay. Treatment with H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> resulted in significant loss of cell viability (

 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>. The highest protective effect was demonstrated by myrcene, followed by 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene and mastic oil (
