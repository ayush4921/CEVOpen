<p>Τo evaluate the in vitro antioxidant capacity of mastic essential oil and its major components, myrcene and 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene, the cell-free DPPH and ABTS assays were utilized. Overall, no radical scavenging activity was able to be detected for mastic oil due to turbidity problems that interfered with the assays when the concentrations were increased. Weak radical scavenging activity was observed for myrcene and α-pinene at the higher concentrations, however no accurate IC
 <sub>50</sub> values could be determined (
 <xref rid="antioxidants-10-00127-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The IC
 <sub>50</sub> for ascorbic acid, which was used as a positive control, was determined to be 26.23 ± 0.16 μΜ by DPPH assay and 30.71 ± 0.24 μM by ABTS assay (

 <xref rid="antioxidants-10-00127-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). More specifically, 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene demonstrated weak DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activity accounting for 47.9 ± 2.78 and 49.28 ± 3.55% inhibition, respectively (
