<p>Overall, the results of the present study indicated that neither mastic oil, nor its major constituents, 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene and myrcene, exhibited direct radical scavenging activity, as demonstrated by DPPH, ABTS, and plasmid DNA protection assays. However, both the oil and its major components induced alterations in the gene expression profile of the oxidative response-related genes 
 <italic>NRF2</italic>, 
 <italic>GSTP1</italic>, 
 <italic>SOD1</italic>, 
 <italic>NQO1</italic>, 
 <italic>GPX1</italic>, 
 <italic>HMOX1</italic>, and 
 <italic>CAT</italic> in HaCaT cells, suggesting indirect mechanisms of their antioxidative activities. Under conditions of oxidative stress, all test substances demonstrated increased cytoprotective properties against H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, while treatment with mastic oil or myrcene prior to or post UVB exposure, respectively, led to enhanced cell viability in HaCaT cells. Moreover, all tested compounds demonstrated enhanced regenerative wound healing capacities. The proposed mechanisms of the antioxidative actions of 
 <italic>Pistacia lentiscus</italic> var. 
 <italic>chia</italic> are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-10-00127-f007">Figure 7</xref>. Our results provide strong support for the promising candidacy of mastic essential oil for future pharmaceutical applications. However, further studies are required, which are currently underway, to elucidate in more detail the mode(s) and mechanism(s) of action of mastic oil, and also to gain insight into the structure–function relationship and potential synergy effects behind its properties and potencies.
