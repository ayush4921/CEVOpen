<p>Interestingly, our results demonstrated that even though mastic oil and its two main constituents demonstrated only negligible cell-free radical scavenging activity, they exhibited significant indirect antioxidant capacity by upregulating a set of genes associated with antioxidant cellular response in human keratinocytes. Incubation of HaCaT cells with mastic oil, as well as myrcene or Î±-pinene, resulted in significant upregulation of the 
 <italic>NRF2</italic> transcription factor and its target genes 
 <italic>GSTP1</italic>, 
 <italic>NQO1, GPX1</italic>, 
 <italic>GSR</italic> (coding for detoxifying enzymes), 
 <italic>SOD</italic>, 
 <italic>HMOX1</italic>, and

In most cases, this upregulation occurred in a dose-dependent and statistically significant manner, suggesting that mastic oil may exert its antioxidant properties through indirect mechanisms. NRF2 is a central regulator of the adaptive cellular response to oxidative stress. Under normal conditions, NRF2 is constitutively expressed at low levels, being repressed mainly by the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) through ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. When NRF2 is activated in response to oxidative stress, it gets released from KEAP1, thereby avoiding degradation, and is translocated to the nucleus, where it binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE) in the promoter regions of various detoxifying and antioxidant enzymes, amongst others [

Many natural products and small molecules have been characterized as NRF2 activators and exert their cytoprotective properties (neuroprotective, hepatoprotective, skin protective, and chemoprotective properties, etc.) through regulating the NRF2-Keap1-ARE signaling pathway [
