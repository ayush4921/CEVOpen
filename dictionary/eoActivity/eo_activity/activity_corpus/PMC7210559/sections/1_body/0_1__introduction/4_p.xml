 <italic>Cinnamomum zeylanicum</italic> belongs to the 
 <italic>Lauraceae</italic> family that grows wild in India, Sri Lanka, Indochina, and Madagascar. Its inner bark has been used as a potent therapeutic agent in ethnomedicine and as a flavoring ingredient in foods [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The antioxidant, antimutagenic, and antimicrobial activities of 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> extracts have been previously evaluated [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, to our knowledge and as seen in the literature, there are little published reports unraveling the mechanism behind the antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> bark essential oil against the most resistant and sensitive food-borne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria to the oil. Therefore, the present study aimed to assess the antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> essential oil through a mechanistic approach to provide more information about its antibacterial mechanism. The 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antiproliferative effect of the essential oil on adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AT-MSCs) was also investigated.
