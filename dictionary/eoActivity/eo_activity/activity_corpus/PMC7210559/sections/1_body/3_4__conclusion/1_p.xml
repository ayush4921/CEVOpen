<p>The results of the present research showed that the essential oil obtained from 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> is rich in bioactive compounds, and its main chemical constituent is (
 <italic>E</italic>)-cinnamaldehyde, comprising 71.5% of the total oil composition. The essential oil conferred superb antioxidant activity and antibacterial effect, especially towards Gram-positive bacteria. A dose-dependent antiproliferative activity was also observed when AT-MSCs were exposed to the essential oil at dosages from 1 to 200 mg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup> for 24 h. Results have shown to be very positive and indicated good potential of the oil for use in food products as a natural bioactive ingredient. However, further studies are required to unravel the mechanisms underlying the antiproliferative activity of the essential oil of 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> and to scale up its application in many food products.
