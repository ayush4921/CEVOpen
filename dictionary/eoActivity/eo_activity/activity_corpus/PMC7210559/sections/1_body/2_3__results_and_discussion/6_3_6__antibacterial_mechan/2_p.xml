<p>The present results have confirmed the detrimental effect of 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic>-originated essential oils against the cell wall of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>L. innocua</italic>. The corresponding changes in cell walls of bacterial species could be due to the membrane lysis and transformations induced by the damage on the membrane integrity and permeability from the essential oil [

 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> essential oil could act on the membrane and lead to a marked change in its lipid profile and increase in its surface areas, thereby altering its structure. It also has the potential to penetrate the deeper part of the cells and facilitate their death rate [
