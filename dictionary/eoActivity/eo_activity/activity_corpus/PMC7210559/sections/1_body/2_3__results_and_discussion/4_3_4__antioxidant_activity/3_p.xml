<p>The 
 <italic>β</italic>-carotene bleaching assay was employed to evaluate the potential of 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> essential oil to prevent lipid peroxidation. It is a useful and practical assay due to the fact that it is performed in an emulsion and many food products tend to be emulsified during their productions [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> essential oil had a high inhibitory effect (63.08 ± 0.81%) against 
 <italic>β</italic>-carotene discoloration. This means that the oil is able to scavenge and neutralize linoleate free radicals that are responsible for 
 <italic>β</italic>-carotene discoloration [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The present results are in line with the findings of other studies [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and the antioxidant activity of the essential oil is mainly ascribed to its phenolic and other bioactive compounds. For example, the antioxidant activity of (
 <italic>E</italic>)-cinnamaldehyde [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], eugenol [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and eucalyptol [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] has been reported in the literature. It is therefore possible to deduce that the 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> essential oil had strong radical scavenging characteristics along with the potential to suppress lipid oxidation reaction. The oil could be used as a natural alternative to the synthetic antioxidants in the food preservation technologies in order to improve the oxidative stability of many food products.
