<p>Essential oils and their biologically active constituents haveoutstanding antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. Thus, they have been vastly applied in food industry, such as in active packaging and surface sanitation of meat and fresh produce [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The present study has therefore evaluated the chemical constituents, antioxidant effect, and antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> essential oil. GC-MS analysis resulted in the identification of 17 chemical compounds for 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> essential oil, as indicated in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. (
 <italic>E</italic>)-cinnamaldehyde (71.50%), linalool (7.00%), 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene (6.40%), eucalyptol (5.40%), and eugenol (4.60%) were the main components of the essential oil. The other important constituents were 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (1.90%), 
 <italic>α</italic>-humulene (1.70%), 
 <italic>δ</italic>-cadinene (1.40%), 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene (1.30%), and limonene (1.20%). In accordance with our results, several studies have reported that cinnamaldehyde is the major chemical compound of 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> bark essential oil [
