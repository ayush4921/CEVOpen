<p>Essential oils could exert their antiproliferation through several mechanisms including (i) disrupting cell membrane integrity 
 <italic>via</italic> depolarization, permeability increment, or reducing membrane-bound enzymes activity, (ii) altering mevalonate metabolism pathway, or (iii) inducing apoptosis [

 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> essential oil has been previously shown against different cell lines, such as F2408 (normal rat fibroblasts) and 5RP7 (H-
 <italic>ras</italic> active-rat fibroblasts) which may be related to synergic effect of some volatile compounds with antioxidant characteristics present in the extract [
