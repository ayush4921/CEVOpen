<p>The TPC of 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> essential oil was determined by means of Folin–Ciocalteu reagent based on a method described by Abeysekera et al. [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of the essential oil was added to 110 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of freshly prepared Folin–Ciocalteu reagent (10-time diluted) which was followed by adding sodium carbonate solution (70 
 <italic>μ</italic>L), incubating at ambient temperature for 30 min, and recording its absorbance at 765 nm. Gallic acid (0.06–1 mg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) was used to formulate the standard curve, and the TPC of the essential oil was then expressed as mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g dry weight 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> bark.
