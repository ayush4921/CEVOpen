<p>The major source of secondary metabolites in plants of the Apiaceae family is the leaves, stems, flowers, and especially fruits. Secondary metabolite contents are mostly allocated to the essential oils and phenolic compounds, which are more important for industrial use, than other phytochemical compounds. Other favorable compounds with antioxidant properties are mainly used in the food industry, while essential oil is edible and has pharmaceutical properties (Tajkarimi et al.,
