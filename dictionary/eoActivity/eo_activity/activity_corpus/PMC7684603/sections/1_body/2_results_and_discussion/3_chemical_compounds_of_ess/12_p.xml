<p>Sesquiterpene hydrocarbons were one of the other groups of the constituent compounds, and its amount was high at the beginning of the phenological growth time; the highest value was observed at the beginning stage of flowering (21.2%) while its value decreased with increasing plant age. Oxygenated sesquiterpene was another group of the constituent compounds. Analysis of our data showed 26.0% of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons at the vegetative stage; after this phenological stage, this amount significantly reduced (Figure
