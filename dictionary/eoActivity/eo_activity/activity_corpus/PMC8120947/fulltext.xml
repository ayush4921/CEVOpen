Peanut meal a low value farm by-product was used to increase protein content and to add value for growers. Bile acid binding okra with cholesterol lowering potential and jalapeno, turmeric and ginger with healthy phytonutrients were included to increase vegetable consumption. The objective was to have healthy tasty snacks with &#x02265;24% protein content. Gluten-free, whole grain, high protein, Sorghum-Peanut meal-Okra (SPO) and SPO-Jalapeno, SPO-Turmeric root and SPO-Ginger root snacks were sensory evaluated by 73 volunteers. Physical testing of the snacks included water activity, true and bulk density, texture and proximate analyses. Taste and Odor of the SPO and SPO-Jalapeno snacks were similar and significantly (p &#x02264; 0.05) higher than SPO-Turmeric root and SPO-Ginger root. Acceptability of SPO and SPO-Jalapeno snacks were both 88%; this value is quite desirable. Acceptability of SPO-Turmeric and SPO-Ginger were only 56 and 51% respectively. Turmeric and ginger have been reported with many health benefits; however these snacks were not preferred by the tasters. Water activity (Aw) of the snacks tested was SPO (0.42) &#x0003c; SPO-Turmeric (0.52) &#x0003c; SPO-Jalapeno (0.54) &#x0003c; SPO-Ginger (0.62). Water activity indicates that all the snacks were crispy and had longer shelf life. Expansion of these snacks was SPO-Ginger root 84%, SPO-Turmeric root 76%, SPO-Jalapeno 42% and SPO only 14%. Data suggest snacks containing spices were fluffy and would give good presentation in packaging. The objective of attaining protein level was clearly attained, as values ranged 24&#x02013;26%. These snacks are easy to make in house kitchens or by food companies. These healthy snacks offer a gluten-free, high protein, tasty choice for all, including vegetarians and individuals hypersensitive to gluten.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="teaser" id="abs0015"><p>Sorghum; Peanut meal; Okra; Jalapeno; Turmeric root; Ginger root.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Sorghum</kwd><kwd>Peanut meal</kwd><kwd>Okra</kwd><kwd>Jalapeno</kwd><kwd>Turmeric root</kwd><kwd>Ginger root</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">Snacks are generally eaten in between meals. Health promoting nutritious snacks would help reduce the risk of many preventable lifestyle related diseases. Young people often prefer snacks over regular meals (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Prepared Foods 2016</xref>). For children snacks are important in school and after school events. For the elderly, snacks offer all the essential nutrients and dietary fiber that are not adequately consumed by them from their regular meals (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Mother-Jones 2017</xref>). Snacks are preferred to be tasty, healthful, flavorful and easy to carry. Consumers do not meet recommended level of whole grain consumption in their daily diets (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">USDA 2015</xref>). The risk of many life style related diseases could be lowered by including whole grains is our diets (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Whole Grain Council, 2009</xref>). It has been observed that consuming whole grain rye and oats significantly lowered the risk of heart disease (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Halnaes et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). Celiac patients are hypersensitive to gluten. This disease results in impaired intestinal nutrient absorbing lining (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Lebwohl et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). Foods containing less than 20 parts per million, gluten can be labelled as &#x0201c;gluten-free&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">FDA, 2014</xref>). This gluten level can be validly tested and can be tolerated by most gluten-sensitive individuals (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Malgorzata et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). Gluten sensitivity is increasing worldwide. Low cost meat patties are made by binding meat scraps using microbial transaminase. Transamination of gluten could create hypersensitivity. It is possible that increased industrial pollution has changed gut microbiome resulting in loss of gluten tolerance. In celiac disease loss of proper intestinal function could be multifactorial (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Umberto et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>). In US there are 40&#x02013;60 thousand individuals diagnosed as celiac, there may be many more as undiagnosed. High fat, salt and sugary snacks are not good for healthy life style. Children as well as adults do not meet daily required amounts of protein, vegetables and dietary fiber (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Mother Jones, 2017</xref>).

Peanut world production in 2017 was over 47 million metric tons per year (FAO STAT United Nations, 2017). About 23 million tons of peanuts result in estimated 12 million tons of peanut oil and peanut meal. Peanut meal contains 44% protein (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>). Peanut meal is used as animal feed as it is extracted using organic solvents. Higher protein foods can be produced using food grade peanut meal obtained using heat and compression extrusion.

Porosity and Expansion were calculated as [Porosity = 1- (&#x003c1;b/&#x003c1;t)] and [Expansion = (&#x003c1;t/&#x003c1;b)].</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><label>2.5</label><title>Texture analysis</title><p id="p0070">Snack breaking point force (g<sub>f</sub>) and stretchability (mm) were measured using TA.XT Plus Texture Analyzer (Texture Technologies Corp., Hamilton, MA 01982 USA).

Taste, Mouth feel and Acceptability of the SPO and SPO-Jalapeno snacks were similar and significantly (p &#x02264; 0.05) higher than SPO-Turmeric root and SPO-Ginger root. These three sensory parameters were also similar between SPO-Turmeric root and SPO-Ginger root snacks. Data suggest that SPO and SPO-Jalapeno snacks were preferred.

At less than 0.6 Aw, all bacterial growth is inhibited; at 0.75 Aw some yeast and molds may grow (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Water Activity, Safe foods 360, 2014</xref>). <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Labuza (1980)</xref> reported shelf stable dry food with Aw &#x02264;0.6. Data suggests that the snacks tested were shelf stable and crispy. True density (&#x003c1;<italic>t</italic>) for SPO-Jalapeno snacks was significantly higher than other snacks tested. Values for SPO-Turmeric root and SPO-Ginger root were also significantly higher than SPO-snacks. However, &#x003c1;<italic>t</italic> values were in a very narrow range 1.36&#x02013;1.39. Bulk density (&#x003c1;<italic>b</italic>) for SPO-Turmeric root and SPO-Ginger root were similar and significantly lower than SPO- Jalapeno and SPO snacks. Values for SPO-Jalapeno were also significantly lower than SPO snacks. Porosity as well as expansion of SPO-ginger root and SPO-Turmeric root was also similar and significantly higher than SPO-Jalapeno and SPO-snacks. In addition, values for SPO-Jalapeno snacks were significantly higher than SPO snacks. Expansion of SPO-Ginger root 84%, SPO-Turmeric root 76% and SPO-Jalapeno 42% suggests that these snacks were fluffy and would give good presentation in packaging. Break force (g<sub>f</sub>) for SPO and SPO-Jalapeno snacks was significantly higher than SPO-Turmeric root and SPO-Ginger root snacks. Data suggest that SPO and SPO-Jalapeno snacks were crispier than SPO-Turmeric root and SPO-Ginger snacks. Stretchability of SPO, SPO-Jalapeno and SPO-Turmeric root snacks was similar and significantly higher than SPO-Ginger snacks.

Acceptability of SPO-Turmeric root and SPO-Ginger root were only 56 and 51% respectively, these snacks require fortification and/or processing modifications.
