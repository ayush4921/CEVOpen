    "Healthful tasty high protein, vegetable, gluten-free snacks are needed for all as well as those sensitive to gluten for in between meals and for after school events. Peanut meal a low value farm by-product was used to increase protein content and to add value for growers. Bile acid binding okra with cholesterol lowering potential and jalapeno, turmeric and ginger with healthy phytonutrients were included to increase vegetable consumption. The objective was to have healthy tasty snacks with ≥24% protein content. Gluten-free, whole grain, high protein, Sorghum-Peanut meal-Okra (SPO) and SPO-Jalapeno, SPO-Turmeric root and SPO-Ginger root snacks were sensory evaluated by 73 volunteers. Physical testing of the snacks included water activity, true and bulk density, texture and proximate analyses. Taste and Odor of the SPO and SPO-Jalapeno snacks were similar and significantly (p ≤ 0.05) higher than SPO-Turmeric root and SPO-Ginger root. Acceptability of SPO and SPO-Jalapeno snacks were both 88%; this value is quite desirable. Acceptability of SPO-Turmeric and SPO-Ginger were only 56 and 51% respectively. Turmeric and ginger have been reported with many health benefits; however these snacks were not preferred by the tasters. Water activity (Aw) of the snacks tested was SPO (0.42) < SPO-Turmeric (0.52) < SPO-Jalapeno (0.54) < SPO-Ginger (0.62). Water activity indicates that all the snacks were crispy and had longer shelf life. Expansion of these snacks was SPO-Ginger root 84%, SPO-Turmeric root 76%, SPO-Jalapeno 42% and SPO only 14%. Data suggest snacks containing spices were fluffy and would give good presentation in packaging. The objective of attaining protein level was clearly attained, as values ranged 24-26%. These snacks are easy to make in house kitchens or by food companies. These healthy snacks offer a gluten-free, high protein, tasty choice for all, including vegetarians and individuals hypersensitive to gluten."
