<p id="p0050">The characteristic shape and design of the snacks was formed by compression of the dough between both cooking surfaces. Snacks were cooked in a 1050 Watts, Chef's Choice KrumKake Express 839 (EdgeCraft Corporation Avondale, PA, 19311 USA). KrumKake Express heat setting was at control dial setting 4 (Range 1–6). Both sides of the cooking surface were lightly sprayed with Pam non-stick cooking spray (ConAgra Foods, Omaha, NE 68103 USA). When the green ready light turned on, 20g snack dough was placed at the center of the lower cooking surface and the upper side was closed and locked. Snacks were cooked for 2 min. Cooking temperature ranged from 185-208 °C as measured by Fluke 61 Infrared thermometer (Fluke Australia Pty Ltd., Baulkham Hills, NSW 2153).
