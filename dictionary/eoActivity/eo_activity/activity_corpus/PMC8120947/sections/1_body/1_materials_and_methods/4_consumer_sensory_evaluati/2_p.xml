The panelists were instructed to use water as palate cleanser between samples consistently throughout the test and evaluate snacks individually and not on a relative rating. Seventy-three in-house voluntary tasters tested the snacks in four sensory evaluation booths under white lights for Color, Aroma, Taste and Mouth feel on a scale of 1–5 (Like very much = 5, like slightly = 4, neutral = 3, dislike slightly = 2 and dislike very much = 1). The acceptability was evaluated on a scale of 1–2 (Acceptable = 2 and unacceptable = 1).
