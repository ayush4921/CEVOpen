<p id="p0065">Bulk density (ρb) of the gluten-free whole grain SPO snacks was measured using Ottawa Sand volume displacement of 10 g sample in triplicate after shaking in a jar of volume 202 ml. The first reading was taken after shaking for 15 min. Two subsequent readings were taken after additional shaking for 5 min each. True density (ρt) was determined five times at 21.4 ± 0.4 °C using gas displacement pycnometer AccuPycII 1340 (Micromeritics Instrument Co., Norcross, GA 30093 USA). Samples of snacks were dried in triplicate at room temperature for 15 h at 0% relative humidity in vacuum desiccators with anhydrous calcium sulfate (W.A. Hammond Drierite, Xenia, OH 45385 USA). Small pieces of dry samples were compressed into density measuring cylinder of the pycnometer and five true density values were recorded. Porosity and Expansion were calculated as [Porosity = 1- (ρb/ρt)] and [Expansion = (ρt/ρb)].</p>
