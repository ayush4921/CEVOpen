<p id="p0080">Color and Aroma of the whole grain gluten-free Sorghum-Peanut Meal-Okra (SPO), SPO-Jalapeno, SPO-Turmeric root and SPO-Ginger root snacks were similar as judged by 73 in-house volunteer tasters (
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Taste, Mouth feel and Acceptability of the SPO and SPO-Jalapeno snacks were similar and significantly (p ≤ 0.05) higher than SPO-Turmeric root and SPO-Ginger root. These three sensory parameters were also similar between SPO-Turmeric root and SPO-Ginger root snacks. Data suggest that SPO and SPO-Jalapeno snacks were preferred. Water activity (Aw), true density (ρ

 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. Water activity was significantly different between each of the snacks tested: SPO (0.42) &lt; SPO-Turmeric (0.52) &lt; SPO-Jalapeno (0.54) &lt; SPO-Ginger (0.62). At less than 0.6 Aw, all bacterial growth is inhibited; at 0.75 Aw some yeast and molds may grow (

 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Labuza (1980)</xref> reported shelf stable dry food with Aw ≤0.6. Data suggests that the snacks tested were shelf stable and crispy. True density (ρ
 <italic>t</italic>) for SPO-Jalapeno snacks was significantly higher than other snacks tested. Values for SPO-Turmeric root and SPO-Ginger root were also significantly higher than SPO-snacks. However, ρ
 <italic>t</italic> values were in a very narrow range 1.36–1.39. Bulk density (ρ
 <italic>b</italic>) for SPO-Turmeric root and SPO-Ginger root were similar and significantly lower than SPO- Jalapeno and SPO snacks. Values for SPO-Jalapeno were also significantly lower than SPO snacks. Porosity as well as expansion of SPO-ginger root and SPO-Turmeric root was also similar and significantly higher than SPO-Jalapeno and SPO-snacks. In addition, values for SPO-Jalapeno snacks were significantly higher than SPO snacks. Expansion of SPO-Ginger root 84%, SPO-Turmeric root 76% and SPO-Jalapeno 42% suggests that these snacks were fluffy and would give good presentation in packaging. Break force (g
 <sub>f</sub>) for SPO and SPO-Jalapeno snacks was significantly higher than SPO-Turmeric root and SPO-Ginger root snacks. Data suggest that SPO and SPO-Jalapeno snacks were crispier than SPO-Turmeric root and SPO-Ginger snacks. Stretchability of SPO, SPO-Jalapeno and SPO-Turmeric root snacks was similar and significantly higher than SPO-Ginger snacks. Percent acceptability of Sorghum-Peanut Meal-Okra (SPO), SPO-Jalapeno, SPO-Turmeric root and SPO-Ginger root snacks is given in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>. SPO and SPO-Jalapeno snacks had significantly higher acceptability than SPO-Turmeric root and SPO-Ginger root snacks. Acceptability of SPO and SPO-Jalapeno snacks was 88%. These acceptability values were quite desirable. Acceptability of SPO-Turmeric root and SPO-Ginger root were only 56 and 51% respectively, these snacks require fortification and/or processing modifications. Turmeric root and Ginger root have many health promoting properties (

 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Ware and Weatherspoon 2017</xref>), however tasters did not prefer these snacks. Principal Component Analysis was conducted using acceptability vs non-acceptability of four sensory parameters (n = 292).
