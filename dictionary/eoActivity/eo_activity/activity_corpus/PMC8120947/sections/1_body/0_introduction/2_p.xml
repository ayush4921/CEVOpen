<p id="p0010">Snacks are generally eaten in between meals. Health promoting nutritious snacks would help reduce the risk of many preventable lifestyle related diseases. Young people often prefer snacks over regular meals (
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Prepared Foods 2016</xref>). For children snacks are important in school and after school events. For the elderly, snacks offer all the essential nutrients and dietary fiber that are not adequately consumed by them from their regular meals (
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Mother-Jones 2017</xref>). Snacks are preferred to be tasty, healthful, flavorful and easy to carry. Consumers do not meet recommended level of whole grain consumption in their daily diets (
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">USDA 2015</xref>). The risk of many life style related diseases could be lowered by including whole grains is our diets (
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Whole Grain Council, 2009</xref>). It has been observed that consuming whole grain rye and oats significantly lowered the risk of heart disease (

 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Lebwohl et al., 2015</xref>). Foods containing less than 20 parts per million, gluten can be labelled as “gluten-free” (
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">FDA, 2014</xref>). This gluten level can be validly tested and can be tolerated by most gluten-sensitive individuals (
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Malgorzata et al., 2017</xref>). Gluten sensitivity is increasing worldwide. Low cost meat patties are made by binding meat scraps using microbial transaminase. Transamination of gluten could create hypersensitivity. It is possible that increased industrial pollution has changed gut microbiome resulting in loss of gluten tolerance. In celiac disease loss of proper intestinal function could be multifactorial (
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Umberto et al., 2013</xref>). In US there are 40–60 thousand individuals diagnosed as celiac, there may be many more as undiagnosed. High fat, salt and sugary snacks are not good for healthy life style. Children as well as adults do not meet daily required amounts of protein, vegetables and dietary fiber (
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Mother Jones, 2017</xref>). It is desired to have gluten-free, high-protein; tasty, nutritious, vegetable snacks prepared in house kitchens or produced commercially.
