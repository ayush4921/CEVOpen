<p>Moreover, no specific comprehensive studies on the cultivation, processing, quality, and management of 
 <italic>Hydnora</italic> species. Only 
 <italic>H. africana</italic> could be cultivated once outside its native area on 
 <italic>Euphorbia</italic> caput-medusae in California. Additionally, trials to cultivate 
 <italic>H. africana</italic> in the University of Bristol Botanic Garden (UK) since 2008 using seeds planted on 
 <italic>Euphorbia tirucalli</italic> L. have been unsuccessful [
 <xref rid="B12-plants-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Hence, more trials to cultivate these plants will enhance understanding of the life history of this important genus and conservation purposes. This will be helpful to populations, which are endemic to endangered environments, for example, 
 <italic>H. arabica</italic> in the Arabian Peninsula and 
 <italic>H. esculenta</italic> in Madagascar.
