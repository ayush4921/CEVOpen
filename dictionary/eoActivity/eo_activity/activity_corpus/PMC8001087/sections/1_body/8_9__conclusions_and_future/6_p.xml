<p>In conclusion, this review paper summarized the past and current research studies on the ethnobotanical uses, phytochemistry, pharmacological activities, and distribution of the genus 
 <italic>Hydnora.</italic> However, further research studies are encouraged to explore the efficacy of the identified bioactive compounds, and understanding the toxicity of these medicinal plants as well as confirming their safety for clinical use. Additionally, as an essential medicinal holo-parasitic plant in both Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, the ethnobotanical identities of the six remaining species of 
 <italic>Hydnora</italic> and their pharmacology, toxicology, and phytochemistry are underexplored, thus requiring more research attention.
