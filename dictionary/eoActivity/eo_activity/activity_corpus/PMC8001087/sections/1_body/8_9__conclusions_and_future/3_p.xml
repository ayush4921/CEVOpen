<p>A previous study indicated that 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> was used together with other medicinal plants to increase its efficacy in curing several ailments. For example, when mixed with 
 <italic>Justicia exigua</italic> S. Moore leaves, it is used to cure paralysis. When combined with 
 <italic>Microglossa angolensis</italic> Oliv. and Hiern (= 
 <italic>Conyza pyrrhopappa</italic> Sch. Bip. ex A. Rich.) roots, it is used to treat diabetes. Further, when combined with 
 <italic>Passiflora edulis</italic> Sims leaves, it is used to treat hemorrhoids [
 <xref rid="B56-plants-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. However, the clinical application of these combinations has not been confirmed. Additionally, the pharmacological action mechanisms underlying the synergistic effects of these species and their medicinal material applications are yet to be explored and also their therapeutic properties remain unknown. Thus, it is highly recommended to test the clinical applications of 
 <italic>Hydnora</italic> when combined with other medicinal plants in future research. The information available on 
 <italic>Hydnora</italic> species indicates that they are less toxic. Therefore, dosages administered should be carefully determined to avoid adverse effects. Furthermore, most of the studies conducted on 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> and 
 <italic>H. africana</italic> focused majorly on their rhizomes. Consequently, future studies should be conducted to evaluate and analyze the biological activities of their leaves, seeds, and stems.
