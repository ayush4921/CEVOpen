 <italic>Hydnora</italic> being the oldest in the parasitic lineage provides a gap for further research in studying the evolutionary origin of their parasitic nature and more molecular research work is encouraged. Recently, molecular studies on this genus have indicated a spotlight using plastome to understand evolution in parasitic plants. Moreover, more research work is necessary to understand the life history and biology as well as the diversity of this genus.
