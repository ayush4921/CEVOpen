<p>This review employed literature published before December 2020 on the ethnobotanical uses, chemistry, and pharmacological activities of bioactive compounds from the genus 
 <italic>Hydnora</italic>. To understand the worldwide distribution and other information on the 
 <italic>Hydnora</italic> species, data were obtained from the following online data sources from February 2020: Regional floras (flora of Tropical East Africa) [

 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> specimen was collected from Mt. Kasigau, Taita Taveta County, Kenya (SAJIT-Mkala 0001, −3.1941° N, 38.4997° E (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00494-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The voucher specimens were deposited at Wuhan Botanical Garden Herbarium, China, and other herbarium collections (e.g., B, K, W, EA, BM, K, NBG, PREUS, GBG, FT, LISU, P, and BM), as part of ongoing research. An extensive search for ethnobotanical uses, pharmacology, and chemistry of 
 <italic>Hydnora</italic> was made using published articles, journal magazines, Ph.D. and MSc dissertations, conference papers, available data from herbaria, and books published in English. Several papers were obtained from published research articles of the genus 
 <italic>Hydnora</italic>. Web of Science, Google Scholar, Science Direct, PubMed, and SciFinder databases further facilitated our study using keywords, for example; 
 <italic>Hydnora,</italic> pharmacological activities, phytochemistry, and ethnobotanical, without a specific time limit. Species details were named as per collector, species number, and the herbarium. The plant list and Plants of the world were used in the verification of species names. For the classification of families, we used the Angiosperm phylogeny group classification system (AGP IV) [
 <xref rid="B40-plants-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Chemical structures were drawn using ChemBio Draw Ultra version 14.0. Excel @ 2016 Microsoft Corporation and Adobe Illustrator version (2020-24.1) was used to draw all figures and graphs.
