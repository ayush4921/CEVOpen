 <italic>Hydnora</italic> species are rarely found and collected because of their uneven distribution and seasonal flowering. Based on the existing documentation, they are scarce and poorly preserved posing a taxonomic challenge [
 <xref rid="B49-plants-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. 
 <italic>Hydnora</italic> features that are mainly used by gatherers to identify 
 <italic>Hydnora</italic> species include rhizome (protrude after rain season), and presence of flowers. Most gatherers prefer collecting the 
 <italic>Hydnora</italic> species in areas they collected them before.
