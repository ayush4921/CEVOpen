<p>Despite some 
 <italic>Hydnora</italic> species being used in traditional medicine, not much information is available on the ethnobotany of other species since most of them have been hardly studied. Moreover, the distribution of 
 <italic>Hydnora</italic> species in Africa and other parts of the world remains unclear. These challenges are perhaps propelled by a scanty distribution of 
 <italic>Hydnora</italic> species, insufficient sample collection, and poor preservation methods [
 <xref rid="B6-plants-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-plants-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-plants-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Due to their mushroom-like appearance, they can be confused with each other, posing a taxonomic challenge. Thus, a worldwide approach and comprehensive multidisciplinary research are essential to untangle the systematics, distribution, uses, and applications of this underexplored genus. Only a few scientific reports exist for 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> and 
 <italic>H. africana</italic>; hence, further research is required, especially regarding the other hardly studied species in this genus. In this current study, we provided more insights and in-depth investigations on traditional and pharmacological uses of this genus, as well as its distribution, which will help in conservation as an alternative therapeutic and food source. Therefore, this review aimed to summarize up-to-date ethnobotanical uses, chemistry, pharmacology, and distribution of the 
 <italic>Hydnora</italic> species, and also point out possible research gaps.
