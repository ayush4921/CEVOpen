<p>Selecting an appropriate method for extraction depends on the bioactive compounds being targeted [
 <xref rid="B61-plants-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. To enhance the extraction process, plant samples should first be pulverized to increase the surface area of sample contact with the solvent method. Moreover, solvents of varied polarities are used in the extraction process. Some of these solvents include chloroform, ethanol, water, methanol, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol. For example, a previous study conducted by Koffi et al. [
 <xref rid="B62-plants-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] discovered that ethanol was more effective in the extraction of many phenolic compounds from walnut fruits as compared to methanol. Compounds tend to dissolve in these solvents depending on their polarity [
