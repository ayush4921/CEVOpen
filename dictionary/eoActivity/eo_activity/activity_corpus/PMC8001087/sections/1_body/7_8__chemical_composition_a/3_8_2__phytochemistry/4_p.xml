<p>Crude drugs consist of multiple chemical species but only traces of these species contribute to their beneficial or harmful effects as well as potency. The content/yield of compounds in medicinal herbs and plants is believed to influence their biological effects [
 <xref rid="B72-plants-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Thus, estimation of compounds yield in these species is important. In this regard, total flavonoids, tannins, phenolics, anthocyanidins, saponins, and alkaloids contents have been estimated and reported in some 
 <italic>Hydnora</italic> species. Elhassan et al. [
 <xref rid="B64-plants-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] reported high TFC, TTC, and TPC of 1163.43 mg QE/mg, 276.6 mg TAE/mg extract, and 5061.13 mg GAE/mg, respectively, in rhizome ethanol extract of 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic>. A high TPC yield of 662.10 ± 14.4 and 661.58 ± 43.9 mg tannin acid/g was reported in water and ethanol extracts of 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> roots, respectively [
 <xref rid="B73-plants-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. A recent study reported low yields of flavonoids, polyphenolics, and tannins in methanol, methanol-dichloromethane, and water fractions of 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> rhizomes [
 <xref rid="B28-plants-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. A similar study was conducted on 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> roots which reported that total phenolics were the most abundant compounds ranging from 14.40 to 15.50 mg/g while alkaloids were the least abundant, ranging from 0.19 to 0.26 mg/g [
 <xref rid="B26-plants-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The slight variation in the yield contents may be linked to the difference in geographical areas where the plant samples were collected, and different extraction methods used.
