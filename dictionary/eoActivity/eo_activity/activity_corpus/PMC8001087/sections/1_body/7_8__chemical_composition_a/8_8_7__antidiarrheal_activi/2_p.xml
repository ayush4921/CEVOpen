<p>As mentioned earlier, the 
 <italic>Hydnora</italic> species have good antibacterial activities, implying their capability to minimize diarrhea which is implicated as an opportunistic disease of bacterial infection such as 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> [
 <xref rid="B69-plants-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. An in vivo study conducted using albino rats demonstrated that indeed 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> root extract has antidiarrheal activity [
 <xref rid="B85-plants-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Firstly, diarrhea was induced in the animals by feeding them with castor oil. Later, they were treated using different sample doses ranging from 200 to 400 mg/kg. Those that received 400 mg/kg dosage showed the highest antidiarrhea inhibition of 74% and 60% after 4 and 6 h, respectively. The activity was concentration-dependent, but not time-dependent. This activity was linked to the inhibition of prostaglandins and other diarrhea inducers implicated in cytoprotective ability as previously reported [
 <xref rid="B85-plants-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Moreover, since not all pharmacological activities of this genus have been fully explored as well as the clinical evaluations of the crude preparations and isolated compounds, this creates an avenue for more research.
