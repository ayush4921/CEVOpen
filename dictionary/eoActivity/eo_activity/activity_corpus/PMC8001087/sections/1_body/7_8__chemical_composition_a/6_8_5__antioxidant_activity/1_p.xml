<p>Pro-oxidants such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated from pollutants from environs and also intracellularly due to stress and physiological activities in mitochondria [

Antioxidants react with the free radicals, suppressing their deleterious effects and thus establishing cell homeostasis. Some of the mechanisms by which extracts from plants exhibit antioxidant properties include peroxidation of lipids, hydroxyl, oxygen radical scavenging, and metal chelation [
