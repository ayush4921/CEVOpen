<p>Understanding the phytochemical composition and content of 
 <italic>Hydnora</italic> species is necessary to substantiate their ethnopharmacological uses. Moreover, characterizing their chemical components would facilitate the proper dispensing of their crude preparations. Currently, only a few studies are available on the pharmacological significance of the 
 <italic>Hydnora</italic> species and their phytochemical composition. 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> is the only species that has been widely explored in this genus.
