<p>Onyancha et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-plants-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] assayed rhizome methanolic extract of 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> using DPPH assay. This fraction showed higher activity of IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 26.7 µg/mL compared with the ascorbic acid (standard) which had an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 29.3 µg/mL. The radical scavenging potential was concentration-dependent. Moreover, the antioxidant potential of three extracts of 
 <italic>H. africana</italic> (water, methanol, and acetone) were evaluated [
 <xref rid="B25-plants-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In both ferric-reducing antioxidant potential (FRAP) and DPPH assays, methanol extract showed high activity while acetone displayed the lowest. In nitric oxide (NO) scavenging, water extract depicted a higher activity than the control standard (gallic acid). Methanol and acetone extracts had good activities as reported in the ABTS assay. The radical scavenging and antioxidant reducing potential depicted by this species can be wholly or partially linked with the high content of phenols, flavonoids, and tannins that were earlier reported in these species. Additionally, the polarity of the solvents might have influenced the results since the compounds dissolved in them differently according to their polarity.
