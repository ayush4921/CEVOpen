 <italic>Hydnora</italic> species are ascribed with good antibacterial and antifungal activities as shown by various experiments. Particularly, 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> has been extensively studied for antibacterial properties. Solvents of different polarities (water, methanol, dichloromethane, and ethanol) have been used to determine fungal and bacterial growth inhibition. Micro dilution, cup-plate diffusion, and agar disc diffusion were the most used antibacterial techniques. Both Gram-positive and Gram-negative are commonly used in most experimental tests. Some of the frequent bacteria strains used include 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Aspergillus aureus,</italic> and 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>. Additionally, activity results were given in minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). In plants, antibacterial activity is low if the minimum inhibitory concentration is greater than 625 µg/mL, high when the MIC is less than 100 µg/mL, and moderate if the MIC is between 100 µg/mL and 625 µg/mL [

 <italic>Hydnora</italic> species are reported in
