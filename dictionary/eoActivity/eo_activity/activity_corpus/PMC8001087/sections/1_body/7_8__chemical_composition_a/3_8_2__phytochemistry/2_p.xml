<p>Different experimental techniques have been conducted to determine the phytochemical profile of these species, e.g., Qualitative chemical tests (colorimetrically), preliminary phytochemical screening, X-ray fluorescence (XRF), thin-layer chromatography (TLC), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Further, quantities of total tannins, flavonoids, and phenolics have been evaluated. Preliminary chemical screening tests confirmed the presence of diterpenes, alkaloids, fatty acids, glycosides, triterpenes, flavonoids, saponins, sugars, steroids, anthraquinones, and polyphenols in

 <xref rid="B69-plants-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Indeed, FTIR analysis results confirmed the presence of phenolics in 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> roots, whereas XRF analysis confirmed traces of mineral elements such as Na, Al, Mg, Si. P, Fe, Cu, and Zn [
