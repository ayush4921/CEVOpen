<p>Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is an ideal analytical technique reported to analyze less polar and volatile compounds [
 <xref rid="B70-plants-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Only a few compounds of pharmacological importance have been characterized in 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> using this technique. They include myristic acid, oleic acid, palmitic acid, sabinene, acetic acid, γ-Terpinene, D-limonene, stigmasterol, and α-Terpinene [

They include katsumadin, rhodioloside, catechin, tyrosol, cirsiliol, oleic acid, trans 3′,5-dihydroxy-4′,7-dimethoxyflavonol, benzoic acid, 3, 4, dihydroxy-, ethyl ester, 2-hydroxyhexadecyl ester, vanillin, and protocatechuic acid. Additionally, it is worth noting that there has been no liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry work performed on all 
 <italic>Hydnora</italic> species. Similarly, no phytochemical studies have been conducted on the other six 
 <italic>Hydnora</italic> species, which is an opportunity for further exploration.
