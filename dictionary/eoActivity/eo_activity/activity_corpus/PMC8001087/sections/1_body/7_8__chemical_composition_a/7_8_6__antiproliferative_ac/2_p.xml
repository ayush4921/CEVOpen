 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> rhizome was assayed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay on breast cancer (HCC) cells in vitro [
 <xref rid="B65-plants-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The methanol fraction depicted moderate anticancer activity of IC
 <sub>50</sub> value 27.20 ± 1.1 µg/mL with high selectivity of SI = 3.68. Water extract showed low activity of IC
 <sub>50</sub> value 499.3 ± 1.3 µg/mL. Water and ethanol extract of 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> root displayed low cytotoxicity against human KB cell lines with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values &gt; 50 µg/mL [
 <xref rid="B65-plants-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. No antitumor activity was observed in the isolated compounds. Similar findings were reported in other studies [

 <xref rid="B82-plants-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] performed an in vivo study and established that the safe dose of 
 <italic>H. africana</italic> root extract was 5000 mg/kg body weight in both male and female laboratory rats when administered orally. This conclusion was drawn after 4 weeks of treating the animal models with the same dose with no reported cases of adverse reactions.
