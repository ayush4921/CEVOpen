<p>Few studies have been done and documented on the ethnobotanical value of the 
 <italic>Hydnora</italic> species. 
 <italic>H. triceps</italic>, 
 <italic>H. sinandevu</italic>, 
 <italic>H. visseri</italic>, 
 <italic>H. esculenta</italic>, and 
 <italic>H. longicollis</italic> are poorly documented with little information known about them because of their subterranean behavior, and some grow in unsafe zones (
 <italic>H. longicollis</italic> in Angola). They are characterized by a unique flowering system and since they are sparsely distributed, it requires a lot of work to be done to identify more of these species. Some of the existing studies indicate that the roots were used in traditional medicine for alleviating diarrhea, possibly due to their high concentration of tannins.
