<p>Based on the literature, the conservation status of 
 <italic>H. arabica</italic> in Southern Oman is stated as less threatened; however, it is rare in Yemen and Saudi Arabia [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> in South Africa is stated as least threatened, as well as in East Africa Flora [
 <xref rid="B6-plants-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. There is a lack of information on 
 <italic>H. sinandevu</italic> conservation status [
 <xref rid="B29-plants-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. 
 <italic>H. visseri</italic> and 
 <italic>H. africana</italic> have also been documented as less threatened in the South African online red list database [
 <xref rid="B51-plants-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. No documentation is available for 
 <italic>H. longicollis</italic>, while 
 <italic>H. esculenta</italic> is stated endemic in Madagascar but there is no information related to its conservation. Similarly, there is no information available on the conservation status of 
 <italic>H. triceps</italic>. The risk assessment of the Hydnoraceae family is not known in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the number of 
 <italic>Hydnora</italic> species in Herbaria is limited [
 <xref rid="B52-plants-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="B53-plants-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,
 <xref rid="B54-plants-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. There is a need for more efforts to establish a proper habitat and area coverage which has been ignored so far. Effective conservation of 
 <italic>Hydnora</italic> species relies on the existing knowledge of the genetic structure of natural populations and their habitat protection. Their possibility of being propagated as indicated on 
 <italic>H. africana</italic> deserves more research [
