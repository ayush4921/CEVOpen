 <p>The genus 
  <italic>Hydnora</italic> (Hydnoraceae) is one of the basal angiosperms in the order Piperales, found in the semi-arid regions of Africa, and the Southern Arabian Peninsula. Plants in this genus play essential roles in communities around the world as revealed by various studies. Currently, there are eight species of the genus 
  <italic>Hydnora</italic>; seven in Africa and one in the Arabian Peninsula. Notably, 
  <italic>Hydnora abyssinica</italic> A.Br. and 
  <italic>Hydnora africana</italic> Thunb. are widely distributed compared to other species. They are widely used for their medicinal and nutritional values. The information on ethnobotany, chemistry, pharmacology, and distribution of genus 
  <italic>Hydnora</italic> was gathered using phytochemical and ethnobotanical books, electronic sources, and published articles. Preliminary phytochemical screening shows that flavonoids, phenolics, proanthocyanidins, and tannins are the main compounds in 
  <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> and 
  <italic>H. africana</italic>. Furthermore, 11 compounds have been isolated from 
  <italic>H. abyssinica</italic>. The biological activities of 
  <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> and 
  <italic>H. africana</italic> have been reported. They include antibacterial, antiproliferative, antioxidant, antidiarrhea, and antifungal potentials. Despite the 
  <italic>Hydnora</italic> species being practiced in ancient folkloric medicine, their traditional uses and pharmacological value are poorly documented. Based on the available information on ethnobotany, phytochemistry, pharmacology, and distribution, we aim to provide research gaps and challenges for a better understanding of this genus. This may be resourceful in the development of effective phytomedicines, and aid in conservation. The available studies on this genus on some aspects such as phytochemistry, pharmacological activities, and distribution are under-reported hence the need for further research.
