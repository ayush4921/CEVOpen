<p>Among the different pretreatments applied in this study, the simplest was reflux extraction (HD-RE). The incubation of finely milled plant material for 1 h at 40 °C in MiliQ water before hydrodistillation resulted in up to 60% essential oil yield increase. It was previously shown that such soaking of the plant material in water [

Also, swelling and hydration of plant material, which enlarge the pores in cell walls and increase the turgor pressure in the still intact plant cells, might lead to the enhanced diffusion of the oil ingredients into the soaking medium. For example, soaking of agarwood in lactic acid for 168 h [
