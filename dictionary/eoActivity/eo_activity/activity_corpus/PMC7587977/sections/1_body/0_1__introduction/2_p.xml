<p>Essential oils are usually isolated by steam- or hydrodistillation. Although these methods have been successfully used for years, novel extraction procedures are being developed in recent decades, with the aim to increase the yield of essential oils and/or improve their chemical composition, while shortening the extraction time [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-25-04818" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. To get closer to that ideal goal, novel production procedures, like ultrasound or enzymatic degradation of the cell wall, are being applied as pretreatments to distillation. Benefits of ultrasound application in solidâ€“liquid extraction are the intensification of mass transfer, improved solvent penetration into the plant tissue, and capillary effects. The collapse of cavitation bubbles near the cell walls is assumed to cause the cell disruption and at the same time a good penetration of the solvent into the cells through the ultrasonic jet [
