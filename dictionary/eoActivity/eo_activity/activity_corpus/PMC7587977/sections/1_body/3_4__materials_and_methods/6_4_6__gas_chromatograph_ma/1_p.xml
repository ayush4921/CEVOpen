<p>GC-MS analyses were carried out with an Agilent Technologies (Palo Alto, CA, USA) gas chromatograph model 7890 A equipped with a mass selective detector (MSD) model 5975 C (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) and an HP-5MS 5% phenyl-methylpolysiloxane capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm film thickness, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). In brief, the injector and detector temperatures were 250 °C and 300 °C, respectively; the column temperature was held at 70 °C for 2 min, and was then increased from 70 to 200 °C at 3 °C/min, and was finally held at 200 °C for 18 min; 1.0 μL of the sample (10 µL of the oil dissolved in 1 mL of pentane) was injected using split mode (split ratio 1:50). Helium was used as carrier gas (1.0 mL/min). The MSD (EI mode) was operated at 70 eV, the ion source temperature was 230 °C, and the scan range was set to 30–350 amu. Identification of volatile constituents was based on the comparison of their retention indices (RIs), determined relative to the retention times of a homologous series of n-alkanes (C
 <sub>9</sub>–C
 <sub>25</sub>), with those reported in the literature and their mass spectra with those of authentic compounds available in our laboratories or those listed in the NIST 08 and Wiley 9 mass spectral libraries (matches higher than 90%). Relative concentrations of components were calculated by the area normalization method without considering response factors.
