<p>Optimal ultrasonic power and duration, chosen based on the overall maximum total phenol yield, were 30% of maximal ultrasonic power during 10 min (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04818-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In some cases, total phenol yield was slightly higher after 15 min ultrasound treatment (e.g. at 30% of maximal ultrasonic power for rosemary, and 90% for bay laurel). Still, since 15 min ultrasound treatment caused intensive solvent evaporation, the shorter time of 10 min was chosen as optimal.
