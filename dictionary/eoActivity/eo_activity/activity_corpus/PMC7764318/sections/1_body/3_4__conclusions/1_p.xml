<p>Marine organisms are becoming attractive sources of compounds that show value beyond the nutritional one. New discoveries of diverse biologically active compounds and the growth of their possible applications in food, functional food and supplement development are receiving more attention. Chitosan, chitin, fish oil, EPA and DHA, EAA, peptides, gelatin, polysaccharides, polyphenols, pigments, vitamins, minerals, and other materials have been characterized by their antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-tumor, antiviral, antimalarial, anti-obesity, and immunomodulatory properties. Many of these compounds have been used as functional food ingredients or their biological properties have been used to treat/prevent some type of health disorder. They have also been applied in the food industry to enhance the food properties (stabilizer, emulsifier, coating or thickening agent, texture modifier) or to enriched the foods with functional components (Ï‰-3) and allow their application in health-promoting foods for direct consumption.</p>
