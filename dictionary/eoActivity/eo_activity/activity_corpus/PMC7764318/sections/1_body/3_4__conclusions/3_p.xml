<p>The futures prospective for the use of marine-originated components depend on their bioavailability, development of environmental friendly technologies for their high-yield extractions, preservation from degradation and identification of individual components that can be purified for use in a particular form. The sustainability of marine sources should be considered when they are exploited on the industrial level. Farming and cultivation of the organisms for a particular component and determining the conditions needed for its high yield recovery is a complex undertaking that requires development of new cost-effective technologies. The nanotechnology techniques may be used for the production of nanosystems with marine-based bioactive molecules to protect these functional compounds against degradation. Also, clinical studies are needed, especially for newly discovered compounds to confirm their therapeutic effect, establish their role in health promoting and quantities for daily consummation. These would help the food industry develop functional foods appealing to the consumers. </p>
