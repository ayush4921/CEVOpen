<p>The high diversity and dynamics of marine ecosystem makes an ideal reservoir identification of new molecules and development of marine nutraceuticals. More than 20,000 marine bioactive compounds have been isolated, however, only a small proportion of them have been thoroughly studied and exploited to some degree [

In 2018, the global market for marine-derived compounds was over 10 billion US dollars, which is expected to rise to $22 billion by 2025 at a compound annual growth rate of 11.3% from 2019–2025 [

The compounds from marine sources that have shown beneficial health effects and a potential use in food and medical applications, include protein and peptides, polysaccharides, ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), enzymes, polyphenolic compounds, pigments, and vitamins [
