In recent years, functional and bioactive compounds from natural sources such as terrestrial and marine plants, animals, or even microorganisms have become sustainable solution that offers new molecules with strong biological activity. With the increase in the field of health-based research these new molecules are gaining more importance. Modern dietary habits and lifestyle in developed countries have resulted in an increasing number of diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, metabolic syndrome, cancer, or neurodegenerative diseases [
