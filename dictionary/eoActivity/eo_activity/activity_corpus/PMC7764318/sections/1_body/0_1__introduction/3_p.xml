<p>Generally, synthetic chemical drugs are still used in medical practice to treat diverse acute or chronic diseases, mainly various disorders involving the immune system’s chronic inflammatory states, allergic reactions, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, severe human tumors, and cancers or as immunosuppressant during transplantation. Despite their treatment’s effectiveness, there are often significant human health concerns regarding the side effects of many of these synthetic chemical drugs and conventional antibiotics due to the misuse, uncontrolled application, and overuse of these compounds and sometimes even to their proper use. The application and especially misuse of some synthetic antimicrobial drugs may be among the principal factor responsible for the development of antibiotic-resistant microbes (ARM). The power of natural nutraceuticals is in their ability to improve the quality of life, prevent or even treat some conditions without any adverse side effects. The safe nature of marine nutraceuticals makes them more desirable, therefore, it may be beneficial to develop non-toxic but effective natural agents as alternatives to the chemical compounds [
