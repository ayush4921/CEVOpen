<p>This review paper provides an overview of diverse marine-based beneficial compounds with great potential as nutraceuticals or application in the food industry that have been in the focus of research in recent years. These include chitin, chitosan, pigments, polysaccharides, and polyphenols from algae, fish oil, fatty acids (FA), essential amino acids (EAA), peptides, gelatin, vitamins, minerals, and dopamine. Not all of them are bioactive compounds 
 <italic>sensu stricto</italic> but they have positive impact on human health because of their beneficial nutritional properties. Many of them have strong biological properties but are prone to deterioration, thus nanotechnology was also reported as a way to protect these compounds and enhance their bioavailability after their application.
