<p>The potential mechanism of chitosan and chitin antimicrobial action is based on the polycationic nature of the biopolymer (i.e., the presence of NH
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>+</sup> groups) which interact with negatively charged surface components of many microorganisms, in turn leading to leakage of cellular substances, and subsequent, cell death [

 <xref rid="B16-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The greater the number of positively charged amino groups in the structure of a biopolymer, the greater its antimicrobial activity. Chitosan contains a greater number of positively charged amino groups than chitin, and therefore, has higher antimicrobial activity [
 <xref rid="B17-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The antimicrobial activity of chitosan and chitin is influenced by many different factors, i.e., MW, degree of polymerization, pH, and DD [
 <xref rid="B15-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Moreover, the source of chitosan and chitin origin influences their antimicrobial properties. Chien et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] reported that raw chitin from crab shells did not show any antibacterial activity, but after the purification process, it showed activity against 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Chitin from shiitake stipes showed better antimicrobial activity against pathogens than chitin from crab shell. The process of chitin discoloration could have an impact on its antimicrobial activity. After cleaning, chitosan from shiitake stipes and crab shells showed good antimicrobial activity against eight pathogens. However, chitosan from shiitake stipes was more effective than from crab shells.
