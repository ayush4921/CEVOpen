<p>High DD and MW chitosan has higher fat binding capacity than low DD and MW chitosan [

The mechanism of action of hypolipidemic chitosan is attributed to its ability to bind to fats, cholesterol, and bile salts. Hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds between chitosan and lipids as well as the electrostatic attraction between positively charged amino groups of chitosan and negatively charged carboxyl groups of FA and bile salts are the cause of chitosanâ€™s hypolipidemic effects [

 <xref rid="B33-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] applied surface-deacetylated chitin nanofibers (SDCH-NF) in the diets of rats. The oral administration of low molecular weight chitosan increased the levels of ATP and 5-HT in the plasma by activating the intestinal microflora. Their results suggested that the anti-obesity effect of SDCH-NF might be due to changes in the gut microflora population. There are studies in which weight gain reduction in overweight subjects has been confirmed [
