<p>Fish oil has been used in the food, biomedical, and pharmaceutical sectors. Several studies have reported that fish oil can be used to treat various disorders and prevent the progression of several chronic diseases (

 <xref rid="B96-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. Fish oil can be used for human consumption either by directly eating fish (and algae) or by consuming different formulations, such as tablets or capsules [

 <xref rid="B97-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that fish oil enriched with EPA and DHA can be applied in the form of capsules to prevent CVD, by reducing the risk of high TG, hypertension, dyslipidemia, heart disorders, while decreasing blood levels of low density cholesterol [

 <xref rid="B98-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. The regular use of fish oil capsules can help prevent cancers, especially for patients with progressive cancers [

 <xref rid="B96-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. Fish oil enriched with ω-3 FA has been recommended to optimize the functions of the human brain, kidney, liver and heart, and hence, to decrease the progression of cardiovascular, hypertension, cancer, neurodegenerative, auto-immune and renal diseases [

 <xref rid="B99-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Also, fish oil enriched with LC ω-3 PUFA can reduce the amounts of C-reactive protein (CRP) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and thus, reduce the risk of inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis [

 <xref rid="B101-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. De Souza et al. [
 <xref rid="B102-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>] have reported that the FA of fish oil capsules can be used for the treatment of other disorders, such as type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity, and also to decrease the atherogenic factors, principally the atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) in patients with T2DM who suffer from obesity. Earlier studies have reported that fish oil can be used to lower the risk of Alzheimer’s disease [
