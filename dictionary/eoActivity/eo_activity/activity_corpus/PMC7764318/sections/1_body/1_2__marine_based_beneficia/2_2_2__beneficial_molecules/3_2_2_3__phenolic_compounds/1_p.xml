<p>Phenolics can be defined as substances with an aromatic ring having one or more hydroxyl groups, including their functional derivatives. Plants contain a large variety of phenolic derivatives including simple phenols, benzoic acid derivatives, phenylpropanoids, flavonoids, tannins, stilbenes, lignans, and lignins [

 <xref rid="B2-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The natural production of phenolic compounds in marine organisms is related to environmental factors, such as salinity, UV radiation, nutrient availability, and temperature [
 <xref rid="B46-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Marine macroalgae phenolics vary from simple molecules such as phenolic acids to highly complex compounds such as phlorotannins (PHT). Some phenolic compounds, such as bromophenols and PHT have been reported exclusively in marine sources [

 <xref rid="B46-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. PHT, assembled through polymerization of phloroglucinol units, are found in high amounts in brown algae [
 <xref rid="B55-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. They can be found in the cell wall or dissolved in cytoplasm and cell organelles [
 <xref rid="B46-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The high reactivity PHT, particularly against oxidation, has increased the interest for food preservation and antiaging products, but also high-value commercial products within the pharmaceutical, cosmeceutical, nutraceutical, and food industries [
 <xref rid="B85-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Phenolics from macroalgae are considered natural anti-allergic compounds for allergy remission [
 <xref rid="B86-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>], as functional ingredients in pharmaceuticals and foods for the treatment and/or prevention of neurodegenerative disease and CVD [

 <xref rid="B88-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>], and as compounds that have potential antidiabetic effects through the inhibition of both α-amylase and α-glucosidase [
