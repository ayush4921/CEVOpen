<p>Chitin is a naturally occurring polymer with crystalline forms (α, β, γ). α-Chitin is the most stable form of this polymer because it has an anti-parallel orientation of polysaccharide chains [

Chitosan ((1-4)-2-amino-2-deoxy-β-D-glucan) is the most common and natural cationic polysaccharide found in exoskeletons of crustaceans, mollusks, insects, and fungi. It is a product of chitin deacetylation, a process that removes acetyl groups (CH
 <sub>3</sub>–CO) from the molecule, which makes the biopolymer soluble in most dilute acids. In the deacetylation process, the amine (NH) groups are released, thus providing chitosan with cationic properties [
