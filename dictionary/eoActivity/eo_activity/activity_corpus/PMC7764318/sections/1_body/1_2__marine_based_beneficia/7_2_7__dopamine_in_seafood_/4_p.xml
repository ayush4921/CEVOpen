<p>Eating a balanced diet is important for maintaining the DA level in blood. However, if DA is urgently needed, it could be injected. Probiotics, some minerals, vitamins, and fish oil supplements might also be used to help boost DA but have been limited because non-prescription approaches have not been promoted. For example, consumption of squid, cuttlefish or octopus ink soups might be appropriate. Pills with DA produced from squid, cuttlefish, and octopus inks might be beneficial. </p>
