<p>Despite the multiple functional roles of vitamin D in humans, its deficiency has been reported in many different populations worldwide [

Seafood, mainly oily fish species or fish liver from non-fatty fish, are the main source of vitamin D in the human diet, since it is the only food product, other than mushrooms and egg yolk, that have this vitamin at relatively high levels [

 <xref rid="B193-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">193</xref>] indicated that not all products fortified with vitamin D have met with a positive consumer response. To successfully use food fortification as a tool to fight vitamin D deficiency, the following issues have to be addressed: consumers have to have a positive attitude towards the food product, consumers have to see a personal benefit from the fortified food, have cultural appropriateness and have an awareness of the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in society.
