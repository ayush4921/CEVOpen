<p>Besides food applications, the properties of marine gelatin can be improved for other uses as well. The addition of phenolic compounds, e.g., caffeic acid, to gelatin from fish scales enhanced its mechanical biodegradability, and cytocompatible properties, thus making the gelatin more effective material for tissue engineering [

Although the functional properties of gelatin are species-dependent and vary based on the extraction methods, it is accepted as a non-carcinogenic, economical protein compared to many other proteins but significantly more expensive than bovine and porcine gelatin, and biocompatible for many pharmaceuticals. Different biomedical products of collagen and gelatin such as gels, scaffolds, microspheres, and films have been shown to be usefulness in tissue engineering, implants, and wound dressing [
