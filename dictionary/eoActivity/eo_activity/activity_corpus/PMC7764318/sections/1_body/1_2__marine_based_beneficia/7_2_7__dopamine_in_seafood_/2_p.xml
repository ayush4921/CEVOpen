<p>Cephalopods like squid, cuttlefish, and octopus have black inks, which are composed of melanin, some enzymes (tyrosinase), some amino acids, and DA. Cephalopods could be evaluated as a source of DA although there are some inkless octopus species [

 <xref rid="B225-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">225</xref>]. Squid ink has anticancer, antioxidant, anti-retroviral, and antimicrobial activities as described by Jismi et al. [
 <xref rid="B226-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">226</xref>]. Palumbo et al. [
 <xref rid="B227-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">227</xref>] showed that squid ink contains a significant amount of DA. Also, Lucero et al. [
 <xref rid="B228-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">228</xref>] implied that the concentration of L-DA and DA in squid ink were 1.15 and 0.19 mM DA, respectively. Cuttlefish (
 <italic>Sepia officinalis</italic>) ink is also a good source of DA in various forms. According to HPLC analysis results based on crude ink obtained from the whole cuttlefish, the concentrations of dopa and DA were found to be 2.2 ± 0.8 and 0.06 ± 0.02 nmol/mg of protein, respectively [
 <xref rid="B229-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">229</xref>]. DA is obtained from L-tyrosine protein-rich foods. Therefore, the concentration of DA in the protein fraction should be measured. In addition to some cephalopod inks, Naila et al. [
 <xref rid="B230-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">230</xref>] reported that DA could be found in fish, meat, and their products. Thus, these protein-rich foods could be evaluated as options for a person who wants or needs to increase DA levels, i.e., the brain needs tyrosine in protein-rich foods like fish to make DA.
