<p>The protein component of fish and other marine organisms and their by-products have ingredients with potentially important roles as functional and medicinal foods that may prevent and/or treat many chronic diseases. Because of the presence of all EAA in significant amounts, the marine macroalgae are a potential source of high-quality proteins with better nutritional properties than terrestrial plants [
