<p>Besides pigments, polysaccharides, and phenolics, marine macroalgae also contain other beneficial molecules such as fatty acids, proteins and vitamins. Various researchers did in vivo studies on the beneficial effects of algae ingestion in rats. For example, Liu et al. [
 <xref rid="B90-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>] reported that supplementation of 
 <italic>Gelidium amansii</italic> in the diet can improve the increased insulin resistance and hypercholesterolemia induced by feeding high fructose diet in rats. Yoshinaga et al. [
 <xref rid="B91-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>] found that administrating of 1 g of wakame (
 <italic>Undaria Pinnatifida</italic>) per 100 g diet significantly decreased serum total cholesterol levels and lead to a reduced accumulation of body fat in rats. However, in both studies identification of the components from the algae responsible for the results was not determined.
