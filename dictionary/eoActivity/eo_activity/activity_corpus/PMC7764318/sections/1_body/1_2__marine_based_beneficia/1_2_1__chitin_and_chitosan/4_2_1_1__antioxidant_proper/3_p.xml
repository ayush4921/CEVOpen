<p>The antioxidant activity of chitosan depends on its MW, DD, and source of origin. Je et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] tested three varieties of chitosan with different MW (5–10, 1–5, and &lt;1 kDa) from partially deacetylated chitosan preparations (90%, 75%, and 50%). The best O
 <sub>2−</sub>, OH and DPPH capturing could be observed with the 1–5 kDa chitosan preparation containing 90% deacetylated chito-oligosaccharides. Similar results were obtained by Anraku et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], where high (HMWC; 1000 kDa) and low MW (LMWC; 30 kDa) chitosan were used to study its effect on oxidative stress in normal and metabolic syndrome model rats. High antioxidant activity was observed in rats where LMWC was used in the diet. On the other hand, diets with HMWC decreased the levels of pro-oxidants such as low lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) in the gastrointestinal tract, thus inhibiting the subsequent development of oxidative stress in the systemic circulation.
