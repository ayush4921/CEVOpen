<p>Chitosan also has an anti-cancer effect by limiting the growth of cancer cells. The anti-tumor activity results from the potential stimulating effect on the immune system [

Although the expression level of MMP-2 was not altered, the amount of MMP-2 in the cell supernatant was reduced. This behavior can be attributed to the post-transcriptional effect of chitosan on MMP-2. Direct molecular interaction between MMP-2 (using atomic force microscopy) and chitosan was observed, as well as non-competitive inhibition of MMP-2 by chitosan (using a colorimetric test) [
