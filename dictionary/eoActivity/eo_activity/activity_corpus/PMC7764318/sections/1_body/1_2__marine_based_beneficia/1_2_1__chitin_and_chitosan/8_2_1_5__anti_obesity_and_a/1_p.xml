Certain ingredients in seafood are believed to have a positive effect on the fight against obesity [

The use of chitosan in dietary supplementation effectively reduces the level of total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-C in the plasma, and the level of triacylglycerol (TG) in the liver as well as plasma. Lowering the level of lipids in the plasma results from the ability of chitosan to bind dietary lipids and bile acids, and inhibit the activity of pancreatic lipase, thus reducing the absorption of intestinal fat in the gastrointestinal tract [
