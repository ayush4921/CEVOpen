<p>Ca is the main mineral obtained from seafood by-products, mainly fish bones and shells [

 <xref rid="B150-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>]. Ca in shells is usually present in the form of calcium carbonate while the Ca from bones is mostly present in the form of hydroxyapatite or tricalcium phosphate [

 <xref rid="B152-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]. Ca from shells is usually obtained through the process of calcination, during which the shell, which is mostly argonite, is heated to obtain specific structural changes. During heating &gt;500 °C the argonite structure is reorganized into the triagonal-rhombohedral structure of calcite and calcium oxide (CaO) if the temperature is increased to &gt;600–800 °C [
 <xref rid="B152-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]. The calcinations of fish bones using temperature in the range of 600–1200 °C results in calcium phosphates in the form of hydroxyapatite and tricalcium phosphate. The higher the temperature of calcination the higher the rate of transformation of hydroxyapatite to tricalcium phosphate [

Those compounds have a number of health benefits and can be used in tissue engineering scaffolds, implants, dietary supplements or food additives. Both hydroxyapatite and tricalcium phosphate have been used in bioceramics to produce scaffolds for tissue engineering and bone regeneration as well as substrates for coatings of metallic implants [

 <xref rid="B155-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>]. Hydroxyapatite can be also a valuable source of dietary supplements for humans, with higher efficiency and tolerability then commonly used calcium carbonate [
