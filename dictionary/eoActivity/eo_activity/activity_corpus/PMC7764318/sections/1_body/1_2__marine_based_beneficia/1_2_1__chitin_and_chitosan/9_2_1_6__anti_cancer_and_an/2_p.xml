<p>Sayari et al. [
 <xref rid="B39-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] extracted chitin from the by-products of 
 <italic>N. norvegicus</italic>, and then chitosan was obtained by partial deacetylation of chitin. The biopolymer showed antiproliferative activity against HCT116 human colon cancer cells. HCT116 cell proliferation was significantly inhibited between 13.5 and 67.5% at 0.5â€“6 mg/mL chitosan after 24 h of cell treatment.
