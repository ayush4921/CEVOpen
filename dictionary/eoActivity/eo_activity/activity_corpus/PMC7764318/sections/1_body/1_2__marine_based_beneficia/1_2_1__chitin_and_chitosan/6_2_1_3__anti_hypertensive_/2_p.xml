<p>Renin cleaves plasma angiotensinogen to angiotensin-I, which is further converted by ACE to angiotensin-II. Renin inhibition is a potential antihypertensive strategy. Park et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] prepared 6 types of COS with different MW (10–5, 5–1, and &lt;1 kDa) and DD (90% and 50%). The results indicated that both DD and MW have an influence on renin inhibitory activity. Deacetylated COS (90%) showed a higher renin inhibitory activity than 50% deacetylated COS.
