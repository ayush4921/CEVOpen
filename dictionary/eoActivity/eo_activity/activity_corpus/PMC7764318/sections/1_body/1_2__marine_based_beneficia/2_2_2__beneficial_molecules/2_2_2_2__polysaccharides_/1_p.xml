<p>Polysaccharides are sugar polymers, a biological macromolecule with different degrees of sulfation found in many species of marine algae [
 <xref rid="B5-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], but also crabs and krill [
 <xref rid="B58-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The polysaccharides isolated from marine organisms are considered safer and less costly than mammalian polysaccharides, thus more suitable for application in drug development, cosmetics, and functional food products [
 <xref rid="B59-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Alginates, carrageenan, fucoidan, agar, furcelleran, ascophyllan, laminarin, polyuronides carrageenan, agar-agar, fucans, fucanoids, chitin and chitosan are marine-origin bioactive polysaccharides with anti-tumor, anti-coagulant, anti-virus, cardioprotective, anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, anti-oxidant, anti-diabetic, antibacterial, and protease inhibitor activities [
