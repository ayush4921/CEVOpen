<p>Although fish bones consist mostly of Ca and P, which constitute &gt;95% of fish bone minerals, various other microelements are also obtained during the preparation process, resulting in a product with potential food supplement applications [

 <xref rid="B160-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>] developed a simple method for Ca preparations from cod and salmon backbone containing 24.9–27.8% Ca and 12.5–13.4% P but also relatively high levels of Mg (4.6–6.6 g/kg) and microelements: 3.9–6.2 mg/kg Cu, 11–24 mg/kg Fe, 28–53 mg/kg Mn and 50–57 mg/kg Zn. Even higher levels of Ca (38.2%) and P (23.3%) have been found in tuna bone powder. Aside from those two elements the bone powder also contained relatively high levels of Fe (62 mg/kg) and Mg (4700 mg/kg) [

 <xref rid="B162-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>], boiling hake bones further increased the Ca and P content of the bone powder, while significantly decreasing the Na and K content. Such powder showed good cell bioavailability and resulted in significant improvement of rat bone mineralization, comparable to the improvements observed for commercial supplements.
