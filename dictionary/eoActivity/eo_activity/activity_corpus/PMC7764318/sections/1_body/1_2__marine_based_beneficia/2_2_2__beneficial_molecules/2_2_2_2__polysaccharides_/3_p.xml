<p>Fucoidan is a sulfated polysaccharide found in the cell wall of brown macroalgae that has been studied for its biological activities [
 <xref rid="B61-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Fucoidanâ€™s structural complexity ranges from the basic structure that contains sulfate groups attached to fucose units to macromolecules containing a range of different monosaccharide units such as mannose, galactose, glucose, and xylose. This complexity depends on various factors such as species, harvesting time, and environmental conditions [
 <xref rid="B62-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Fucoidan extracts have regulatory approvals for use in foods and dietary supplements for consumption up to 250 mg/day [
 <xref rid="B63-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Anticancer effects of fucoidans on different cancer cell lines have been reported including inducing apoptosis in 5637 human bladder cancer cells [
 <xref rid="B64-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], in human breast (MCF-7) and colon cancer cell (HCT15) lines [
 <xref rid="B65-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], and the colon cancer adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) cell line [
 <xref rid="B66-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Fucoidans from brown algae also have an inhibitory role in colony formation in human melanoma and colon cancer cells [
