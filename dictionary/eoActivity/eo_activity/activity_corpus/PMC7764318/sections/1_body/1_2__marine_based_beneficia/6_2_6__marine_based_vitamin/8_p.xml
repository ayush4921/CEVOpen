<p>Graff, et al. [
 <xref rid="B180-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">180</xref>] have investigated the use of Atlantic salmon fed with a high vitamin D
 <sub>3</sub> and K
 <sub>1</sub> diet on several bone formation markers of human subjects with additional Ca supplementation. They found that the consumption of such treated salmon improved more significantly the bone formation markers then in patients consuming salmon fed only high vitamin D
 <sub>3</sub>. Surprisingly, these results were observed even though the vitamin K was in the form of phylloquinone, meanwhile the positive effect on bone quality is usually associated with menaquinone [
