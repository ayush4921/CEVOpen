<p>Among the biological species, marine algae are classified as one of the primitive producers of whole aquatic biomass making them a sources of natural bioactive molecules [

 <xref rid="B47-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The NPM synthesized by marine algae can be classified into three essential categories: carotenoids, chlorophylls, and phycobiliproteins [
 <xref rid="B43-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Their stability is dependent on their chemical structures, which can be influenced by several factors, such as oxygen, light, heat, air, and pH [
