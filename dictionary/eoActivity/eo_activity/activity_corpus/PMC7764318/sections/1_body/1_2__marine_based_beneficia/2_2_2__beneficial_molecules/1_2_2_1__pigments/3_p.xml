 <xref rid="B47-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. These NPM are classified into the three categories of phycoerythrins, allophycocyanins, and phycocyanins [

These photosynthetic pigments have various significant pharmaceutical and health-improving applications, such as their use in histochemistry, immunoassays, flow cytometry, and cell imaging. They can be used for reactive oxygen substances (ROS) detection based on the antioxidant properties when isolated from
