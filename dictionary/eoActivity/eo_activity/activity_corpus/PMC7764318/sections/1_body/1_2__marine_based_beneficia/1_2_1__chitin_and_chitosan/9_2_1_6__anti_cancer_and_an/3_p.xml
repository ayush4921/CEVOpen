<p>Resmi et al. [
 <xref rid="B40-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] extracted chitosan nanoparticles from shrimp shell waste using two successive steps: demineralization and deproteinization. Compared to chemically synthesized chitosan, chitosan NP showed an inhibitory effect on the proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells and minimal cytotoxicity of normal L929 fibroblast cells. El-Naggar et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] used freshwater crayfish waste from 
 <italic>Procambarus clarkii</italic> as a precursor to obtaining chitin, which was deacetylated to obtain chitosan. The chitosan was transformed into chitosan NP and Schiff bases. Cytotoxic activity against three cell lines (HepG-2, HCT-116 and MCF-7) indicated the best anti-tumor activity for chitosan Schiff bases, followed by chitosan NP. Chitosan showed the lowest anti-tumor activity of all the tested compounds. Sedghi et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] prepared nanofibers of chitosan derivatives. The results of the MMT test indicated that the material had good activity against 4T1 breast cancer cells and did not show any cytotoxic effects on normal cells, suggesting a promising application of nanofibers in the prevention of breast cancer recurrence.
