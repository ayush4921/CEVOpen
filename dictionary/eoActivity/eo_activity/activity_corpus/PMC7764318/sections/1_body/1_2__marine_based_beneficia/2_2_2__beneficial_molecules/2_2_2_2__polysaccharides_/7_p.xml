<p>Ulvan, a water-soluble polysaccharide, is found in green macroalgae of the order Ulvales (
 <italic>Ulva</italic> and 
 <italic>Enteromorpha sp.</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B79-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Its main constituents are sulfate, rhamnose, xylose, iduronic and glucuronic acids [
 <xref rid="B80-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Ulvan has shown various biological activities, including antioxidant, antiviral, anticancer, immunomodulating and antihyperlipidemic, and it also has the capacity to modulate cellular signaling processes in plant and animal systems which lead to beneficial effects on productivity and health [
 <xref rid="B81-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Ulvan has also been reported to reduce total serum cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglycerides while elevating high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels [
 <xref rid="B82-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Abd-Ellatef et al. [
 <xref rid="B83-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>] tested ulvan using in vitro bioassays on a human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) and an in vivo animal model of breast carcinogenesis and found that it had a potential chemo-preventive effect.
