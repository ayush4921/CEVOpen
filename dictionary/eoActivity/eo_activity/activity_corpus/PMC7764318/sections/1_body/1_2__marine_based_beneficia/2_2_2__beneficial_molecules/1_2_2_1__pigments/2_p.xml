<p>Carotenoids are an important class of fat-soluble NPM found in algae biomass and belong to the tetraterpenoids group consisting of a linear polyene chain (C40) [

 <xref rid="B47-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="B51-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Based on their chemical structure the carotenoids can be classified as unsaturated hydrocarbon carotenoids, commonly known as carotenes, including lycopene α-carotene and β-carotene pigments and xanthophylls, known as oxygenated carotenoids, such as astaxanthin, lutein, canthaxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin, and zeaxanthin [

 <xref rid="B52-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Generally, fucoxanthin and astaxanthin are the most abundant and natural carotenoid pigments produced in seaweeds or marine algae [

On the other hand, the stability of carotenoid pigments is mainly affected by the influence of various environmental conditions, which can generate structural modifications due to oxidation, dehydrogenation, and hydrogenation reactions [
 <xref rid="B53-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. These NPM are considered to be antioxidants due to their role in the protection of the cells, retinal epithelium and skin against oxidative damages and thus reducing the risk of CVD, atherosclerosis, neurological and other non-communicable diseases (NCD) [

 <italic>S. polycystum</italic>, was shown to have inhibitory activities on ACE, α-amylase and α-glucosidase, which potentially reduces CVD related risk [

 <xref rid="B55-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Furthermore, the carotenoid pigments and particularly fucoxanthin can act as antitumor, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, anti-obesity and neuroprotective agents, and can treat rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis and diabetic disorders [
