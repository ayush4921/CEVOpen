<p>Laminarin is a brown algal polysaccharide with a low MW (~5 kDa). It is found in 
 <italic>Laminaria</italic> and 
 <italic>Saccharina</italic> species and to some extent in 
 <italic>Ascophyllum</italic> and 
 <italic>Fucus</italic> species. Laminarin is a storage β-glucan composed of (1,3)-β-D-glucan and some β-(1,6)-intrachain links [

 <italic>Cystoseira barbata</italic> (5% cream) significantly enhanced the in vivo healing process, improved wound contraction, accelerated re-epithelization, and allowed restitution of mice skin tissue [
