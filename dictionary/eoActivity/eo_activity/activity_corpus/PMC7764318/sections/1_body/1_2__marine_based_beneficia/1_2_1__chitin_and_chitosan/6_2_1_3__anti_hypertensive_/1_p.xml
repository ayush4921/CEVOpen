<p>Hypertension causes the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). In the human blood, angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) contributes to the regulation of blood pressure by converting inactive angiotensin I into its active form, angiotensin II, and this causes small blood vessels to narrow and blood pressure to rise. To prevent hypertension, inhibition of ACE activity may be beneficial [
