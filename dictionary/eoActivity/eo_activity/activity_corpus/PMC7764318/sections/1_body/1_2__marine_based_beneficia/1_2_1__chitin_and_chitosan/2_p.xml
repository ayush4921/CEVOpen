<p>Chitin and chitosan are natural polymers with the same chemical structure (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-18-00627-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Both consist of a mixture of mainly N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and a small amount of D-glucosamine. Chitin is insoluble in an aqueous environment, while chitosan is soluble in an acidic environment due to the presence of free protonable amino groups present in the D-glucosamine units [

Chitooligomers (COS) are the degraded products of chitosan or chitin, which are obtained by enzymatic or chemical hydrolysis of chitosan. Chitosan has three types of reactive functional groups, an anamine/acetamide, as well as both primary and secondary hydroxyl groups in positions C-2, C-3, and C-6, respectively (
