<p>Seafood, especially seaweeds, can be a valuable source of vitamin A [

 <xref rid="B184-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">184</xref>], who reported that vitamin A in dried 
 <italic>Ulva lactuca</italic> was below the detection limit. Vitamin A can also be obtained from fish and its by-products. Nam et al. [
 <xref rid="B183-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">183</xref>] used an enzymatic hydrolysis of Pangasius catfish filleting by-products which included head, trimmings, viscera, scales, liver, roe and skin, during a zero-waste procedure to obtain protein hydrolysate, hydroxyapatite and, after additional purification, fish oil with a vitamin A content of 334 µg/kg of oil. The vitamin A content, however, was relatively low, when compared to the retinol content in an unspecified fish wastes oil reported by Tyśkiewicz et al. [
 <xref rid="B197-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">197</xref>] (0.70 g/kg).
