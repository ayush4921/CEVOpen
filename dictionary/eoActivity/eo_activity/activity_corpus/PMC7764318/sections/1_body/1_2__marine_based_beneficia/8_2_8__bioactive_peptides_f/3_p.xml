<p>Bioactive peptides are inactive in their parent protein but can be released when large pre-propeptides are broken down to specific protein fragments and modified to have numerous beneficial effects to improve the physiological functions of the body [

The best sources of structurally diverse bioactive peptides with functions such as ACE inhibitory and anti-hypertensive, antioxidative, anticoagulant, and antimicrobial effects are marine organisms. Marine bioactive peptides may be produced by solvent extraction, enzymatic hydrolysis, or microbial fermentation of proteins, resulting in fragments that usually contain 3â€“20 amino acid residues. Their amino acid sequence determines the biological activity. The molecular size and structural characteristics of peptide mixtures in protein hydrolysates contribute to their bioactivity, and low MW fractions (1 to 5 kDa) in general contain more potent antioxidative peptides [

 <xref rid="B236-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">236</xref>]. For example, those with a tripeptide sequence at the C-terminal end of peptides with antihypertensive activity contain hydrophobic amino acid. They have been shown to be ACE-inhibitory peptides [

Commercial ACE inhibitors (benazepril, captopril, enalapril, perindopril, trandolapril, quinapril, lisinopril and moexipril) produce side effects such as coughs, increased blood potassium levels, low blood pressure, skin rashes, headaches, fatigue, fetal and taste disorders [
