<p>A cause of many health disorders, such as diabetes, neurodegenerative and inflammatory diseases, and cancer reflect uncontrolled production of ROS that attack macromolecules such as membrane lipids, proteins, and DNA resulting in cellular or tissue level injuries [

Lipid oxidation is also a major cause of food quality deterioration that leads to rancidity and formation of undesirable lipid peroxidation products, such as malondialdehyde. Oxidation decreases both the sensory and nutritive quality of foods. Lipid oxidation has long been recognized as a major problem during the handling, processing, and distribution of PUFA-rich foods. Natural antioxidants may serve as an alternative to the synthetic antioxidants (propyl gallate, butylated hydroxytoluene, butylated hydroxyanisole, and tert-butylhydroquinone) used to control lipid oxidation but restricted because of their induction of DNA damage and potential toxicity [
