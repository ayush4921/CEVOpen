<p>Gelatin is not a naturally occurring protein. It is, however, one of the most versatile biopolymers, an animal-based protein obtained by thermal denaturation with partial acid/alkaline hydrolysis or enzymatic hydrolysis of collagen. The marine-originated gelatin is primarily composed of crude protein, moisture, and ash, with some carbohydrates. Its properties are different from those from animals sources which has found some suitable applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries, but also for medicinal purposes [

 <xref rid="B273-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">273</xref>]. In 2018 the global gelatin market was estimated at 4.5 billion USD [
 <xref rid="B274-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">274</xref>], with an increased demand for gelatin from sources other than bovine and porcine. The raw materials commonly used for gelatin production are the bones, skins, and connective tissue of terrestrial animals such as cattle and pigs. The need for new sources of collagen reflect both religious reasons and health issues related to the bovine spongiform encephalopathy outbreak which has led to some consumers needing or desiring alternate sources [
 <xref rid="B275-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">275</xref>]. Marine gelatins meet many of their concerns. The viscous liquid state of the marine gelatins at room temperature is both a benefit and an issue, good absorption capacity, the survival of enzymatic digestion products in the gastrointestinal tract, enhanced digestibility, and good film-forming properties are the functional properties that mostly are an advantage of marine gelatins in some applications, particularly in biomedical applications and in food uses [

 <xref rid="B273-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">273</xref>,
 <xref rid="B276-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">276</xref>]. Functional properties of gelatin such as gelling, foaming, stabilizing, or emulsifying ability determine its suitability for many applications in food production, directly or as an ingredient in food coatings, and an active component in packaging material [
 <xref rid="B277-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">277</xref>]. Some characteristics of marine gelatin, such as gel strength, MW, and melting temperature are lower than those of gelatin from terrestrial species and present a challenge in the industrialization of fish gelatin. Also, there is a difference of gel strength and melting temperatures between cold- and warm-water fish, with gelatin from warm-water fish being more similar to bovine or porcine gelatins [

 <xref rid="B278-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">278</xref>,
 <xref rid="B279-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">279</xref>]. This is due to the differences in protein characteristics and amino acid composition between cold- and warm-water species as well as a lower hydroxyproline content of cold-water fish [
 <xref rid="B280-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">280</xref>]. The gel strength of marine-origin gelatin ranges from 98 to 600 g [
 <xref rid="B281-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">281</xref>]. The composite of a particular gelatin’s properties determines the potential applications. Marine-originated gelatins with lower melting points have some advantages in food application. They can be used for microencapsulation of colorants, enhancement of sensory properties of low-fat foods (flavor), as a food emulsifier, stabilizer, and foaming agent [
 <xref rid="B273-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">273</xref>,
 <xref rid="B282-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">282</xref>]. Various approaches have been investigated to improve the functional properties of marine gelatins. Gelatin can be modified using transglutaminase to improve gelatin elasticity and cohesiveness of the gels as well as providing non-thermoreversible gels with lower gel strength [
 <xref rid="B283-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">283</xref>]. Further, if hydrolyzed with papain, fish gelatin may act as a strong antimicrobial agent [
 <xref rid="B284-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">284</xref>]. The strength of gelatin gels may be increased by non-electrolytes (glycerol, sorbitol, sucrose) while the gel strength and melting point of fish gelatin can be increased by incorporation of co-enhancers such as Mg, sulphate, sucrose, and transglutaminase [
 <xref rid="B285-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">285</xref>]. Significant improvement in the gel strength and reduction in viscosity can be obtained using ultraviolet irradiation [
 <xref rid="B278-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">278</xref>]. Jridi et al. [
 <xref rid="B286-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">286</xref>] showed that gelatin from cuttlefish stops β-carotene bleaching suggesting its importance in food protection from drying and exposure to light and its possible application in the production of food packaging material. The application of gelatin in food packaging would contribute to reducing drip loss, oxygen-induced changes such as lipid oxidation and color changes. Production of edible coatings that may carry antioxidants and/or antimicrobials might prolong the shelf-life including flavor and odor loss during storage and change the mechanical and barrier properties of the films [
 <xref rid="B287-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">287</xref>,
 <xref rid="B288-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">288</xref>]. Gelatin does not meet the dietary requirements for proteins as it is nutritionally unbalanced but when combined with other proteins, the expectation is that it functions like any other protein. It can be used to improve the functional properties of food and beverage products and to enhance the nutritional value of food products.
