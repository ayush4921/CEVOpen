<p>Allergies are caused by an interaction between an antigen and the antigen-specific IgE. On the other hand, asthma is an allergic disease characterized by increased respiratory tract responsiveness. Vo et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] showed that with COS with three different MW ranges (1–3, 3–5 and 5–10 kDa), the lowest MW attenuated allergic reactions by inhibiting degranulation and cytokine production in mast cells. Chung et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of LWM COS prepared from HMW chitosan as a result of enzymatic digestion against allergic reactions and allergic asthma in vivo and in vitro. The results indicated that LMW-COS had anti-inflammatory effects related to the regulation of Th2 and proinflammatory cytokines and therefore, may be a promising candidate for the development of a potent therapeutic agent for the treatment of allergic asthma.
