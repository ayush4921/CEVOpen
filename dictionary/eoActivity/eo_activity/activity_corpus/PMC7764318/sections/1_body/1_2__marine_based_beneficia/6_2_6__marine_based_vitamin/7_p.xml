<p>The typical recommended daily intake (RDI) for vitamin K varies depending on the source. The typical recommendations are in the range of 55–75 µg/day (~1 µg/kg of body weight/day), however, some sources recommend a daily intake of ≤600 µg/day [

 <sub>1</sub> and K
 <sub>2</sub> usually within the range of 1.8–11.3 µg/kg. However, there are seafood sources with much higher vitamin K content such as eel (644 µg/kg) or dried seaweeds (1750–12,900 µg/kg) [

 <sub>2</sub>) while algae are a source of phylloquinone (K
 <sub>1</sub>) and those two form of vitamin K often show different functions and health promoting properties, therefore algae should not substitute for fish or other animal-based food products as a source of vitamin K, but rather complement it [
