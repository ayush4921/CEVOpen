<p>Krill are small crustaceans that are particularly abundant in the Northern (Arctic) and Southern (Antarctic) polar seas. Krill oil (KO) is extracted from the Antarctic 
 <italic>Euphausia superba</italic>, the largest of the krill species. Krill is a sustainable source of ω-3 PUFA, including EPA and DHA. While fish oil mainly contains ω-3 PUFA linked to triacylglycerides (TAG), KO contains a significant portion of these FA bound to phospholipids (PL) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) is the most abundant. More than 80% of EPA and DHA in KO are in PC [

Nanoliposomes could effectively control the release of KO in a simulated gastrointestinal system. These results showed that the nanoform of KO could be used to improve the release profile [
