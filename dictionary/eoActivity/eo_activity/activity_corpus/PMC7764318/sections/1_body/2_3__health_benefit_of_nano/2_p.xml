<p>Nanotechnology applications of marine-based products could be integrated with other food materials having probiotic properties. For example, nanoemulsion technology provided improved physicochemical properties of yogurt enriched with fish oil [

 <xref rid="B304-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">304</xref>] showed that the marine algae product fucoxanthin was safe for humans, and its nanosuspension delivery could enhance the efficacy of supplements. Nanostructures generally provide a larger contact area on the surface of the materials and can provide a good controlled release profile.
