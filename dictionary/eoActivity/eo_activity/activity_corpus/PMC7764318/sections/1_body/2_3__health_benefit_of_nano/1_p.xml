<p>Nanotechnology is defined as an emerging technology enabling the development of sustainable foods and medicines. For example, fatty acid and amino acid stability in fish meat are improved using nanofibers [

 <xref rid="B295-marinedrugs-18-00627" ref-type="bibr">295</xref>]. The intake and stability of vitamins are also important and chitosan-based nanofibers and thymol-loaded electrospun chitosan-based nanofibers could be successfully used to provide nicotinamide acid, pyridoxal, pyridoxine and pyridoxamine in fish fillets [
