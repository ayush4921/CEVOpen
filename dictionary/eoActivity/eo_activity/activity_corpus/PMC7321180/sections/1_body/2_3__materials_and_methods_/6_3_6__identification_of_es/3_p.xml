<p>GC/MS analyses were carried out on a GC/MS (Agilent Technologies-5975C-MS, 7890A-GC, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with HP-5MS (30 m × 0.25 mm (i.d) × film thickness 0.25 μm capillary column). The oven temperature was programmed as follows: From 60 °C to 210 °C with a rate of 3 °C/min, then increased to 240 °C with a rate of 20 °C/min, and then the final temperature kept for 8.5 min, run time: 60 min. The electron ionization energy was 70 eV in the electronic ionization (EI) mode, ion-source: 230 °C, detector: MS, interface line temperature: 280 °C, injector: 280 °C, split ratio: 1:50, carrier gas: He, 1 mL/min, mass range: 50–480 amu.</p>
