<p>The percentages of essential oil components were calculated by the area normalization method. The components of the oil were identified by comparison of retention indices (RRI, HP-5) in their mass spectra with those of an Adams library and sorted in NIST and Wiley libraries or with authentic compounds reported in the literature. Retention indices were determined using retention times of 
 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes that were injected after the essential oil under the same chromatographic conditions. Finally, all data except essential oil constituents were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) using JMP8 software and LSD tests at 5% levels for mean comparison.
