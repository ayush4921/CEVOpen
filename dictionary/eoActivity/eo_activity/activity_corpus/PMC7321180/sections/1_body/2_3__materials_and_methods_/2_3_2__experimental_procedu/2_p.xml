<p>For soil application of PSM, 7, 14, and 21 g dry seeds of 
 <italic>Psyllium ovata</italic> were ground and mixed with the soil completely. For the soil + root application of PSM, after preparing the soil as above, the seedlings were dipped (for 2 min) in the different respective concentration solutions of PSM before transplanting. PSM solutions were prepared on the basis of the Marlett and Fischer (2005) method by some modification [
 <xref rid="B60-molecules-25-02503" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Briefly, different weights of grounded 
 <italic>P. ovata</italic> seeds (0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 g) were dissolved in 100 mL distilled water for 10 h at ambient temperature (20 ± 1 °C). Then, the solutions were centrifuged at 10,000 g for 30 min. Next, the seedlings were dipped in the solutions for 2 min and transferred to the pot (30 cm diameter and 10 kg capacity) for growing [
