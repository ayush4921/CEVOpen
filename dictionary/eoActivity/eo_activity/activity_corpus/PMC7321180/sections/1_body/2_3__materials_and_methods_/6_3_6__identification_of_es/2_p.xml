<p>GC analysis was carried out using an Agilent-Technologies−7890A gas chromatograph (Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a HP-5 column (30 m × 0.32 mm i.d) film thickness (0.25 μm). The oven temperature started from 60 °C and was then programmed to rise to 210 °C at a rate of 3 °C /min, and then 210 °C to 240 °C at 20 °C/min and held for 8.5 min. Injector and detector (FID) temperatures were 280 °C and 290 °C, respectively; N
 <sub>2</sub> was used as a carrier gas with a linear velocity of 1 mL/min. The split ratio was 1:50.
