<p>All treatments showed significant effects on basil performance, quantity, and quality of its essential oil and also on water use efficiency over the control treatment. Both polymers (regardless of concentration and method of application) exhibited favorable effects on the chemical composition of essential oil, especially increasing linalool and decreasing eugenol compared to the control. These effects would suggest a different modulation of the secondary metabolic pathways involved in biosynthesis of the essential oil constituents, by stimulating the mevalonate route (leading to linalool) and suppressing the phenylpropanoid pathway (leading to eugenol). The level of methyl chavicol and 1,8-cineole after the application of these polymers did not show a definite trend, but the content was in the allowable limit. PSM application (in both methods and in different concentrations) increased the amount of major constituents more than Stockosorb
 <sup>®</sup> application. This is a promising aspect because PSM is a natural product. Results of this study showed that the major constituent in the essential oil of treated plants by both polymers is linalool. In addition, compounds with restrictions because of toxicity, such as camphor, methyl eugenol, 1,8-cineole, and methyl chavicol, were in the allowable limit, while in the control treatment, eugenol was not within the allowable limit [

Although PSM treatment (mixed with soil + root) had the best results for the vegetative traits and water use efficiency, the highest amount of methyl chavicol and linalool was found in plants treated with PSM. The quantity and essential oil yield were highest in plants treated with Stockosorb
 <sup>®</sup> mixed with soil + root. However, selection of the polymers (Stockosorb
 <sup>®</sup> and PSM) by the farmer depends on the application method and also depends on the cultivation system as direct seeding or seedling transplanting. Degradability of the polymers in soil (shelf life), the HP price, and the availability of the polymer in the market are very important issues to select each HP by farmers. In essence, these results showed that natural compounds could be a good alternative to chemical compounds for increasing water availability in the soil and increasing water use efficiency, especially in arid and semi-arid agricultural environments. In these terms, cultivation of medicinal and aromatic plants could be improved in countries with arid and semi-arid conditions, with economic benefits for farmers in the face of low production costs.
