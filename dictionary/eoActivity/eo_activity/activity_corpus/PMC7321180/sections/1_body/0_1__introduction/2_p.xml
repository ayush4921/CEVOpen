<p>In many regions of the world, including Iran, drought stress is one of the largest factors that decreases agricultural crop production more than any other single environmental factor [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-02503" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Therefore, the water holding capacity of soil and water use efficiency are important issues for increasing yield, especially in arid and semi-arid regions [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-02503" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Nowadays, the application of water-holding compounds like superabsorbent polymers or hydrophilic polymers (HPs) in agricultural and horticultural fields is a simple method to remedy these issues [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-25-02503" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Superabsorbent polymers can be divided into two classes, on the basis of original source, natural and synthetic. Natural types are polysaccharide-based or polypeptide-based (gelatin and collagen). Synthetic types are petrochemical-based [
