<p>Hydrophilic polymers (HPs) are either natural or synthetic. Some natural HPs are polysaccharides, humus, polyuronids, and alginic acid. Mucilages are herbal polysaccharides and commonly include carbohydrates such as arabinose, xylose, and uronic acid along with cellulose and other water-soluble polysaccharides [

 <italic>Agrostis tenuis</italic> [

 <italic>Linum usitatissimum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Matricaria chamomilla</italic> [

Research has also shown that the application of superabsorbent polymers caused an increase in unsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic acid and reduced saturated fatty acids in six cultivars of canola, ultimately leading to an increased quality of canola oil [

Most studies focused on the effect of HPs only on plant growth parameters and the effects of HPs on medicinal plants, and their production of active ingredients has not been extensively investigated. Therefore, more research is needed on medicinal plants for their reaction to HPs, especially for production in arid areas. The aim of medicinal plant production is phytochemical extraction and, in this regard, increasing the yield (dry herb yield), yield components, and phytochemical content is very important. Therefore, the aims of this investigation were to study the effects of HPs on water use efficiency, dry matter, leaf area, essential oil quantity, quality, and yield of basil, and to evaluate its potential application for cultivation of the plant in arid regions.
