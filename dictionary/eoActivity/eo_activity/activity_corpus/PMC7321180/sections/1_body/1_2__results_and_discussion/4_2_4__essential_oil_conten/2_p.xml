<p>According to the Council of Europe (2001) [

 <xref rid="B45-molecules-25-02503" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Overall, the yield and essential oil percentage was severely reduced by the water stress conditions. Medium water stress has been shown to increase secondary metabolites without negative effects on physiological activities, growth, and flowering [
