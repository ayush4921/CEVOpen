<p>According to the results, significant effects (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.01) were recorded in the case of essential oil yield by all treatments. According to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02503-f005">Figure 5</xref>, the lowest essential oil yield (0.06 mL per plant) was observed in control plants and the highest (0.21 mL per plant) belonged to plants treated with Stockosorb
 <sup>®</sup> at 0.2% (soil + root application); furthermore, there was no significant difference with PSM at a concentration of 0.3% (soil + root application). All treatments in comparison to the control decreased the adverse effect of water shortage of the root zone and kept soil water content near to the field capacity. Treatments provided greater support of the plants’ water requirements for proper growth and development, increasing essential oil yield in comparison to the control when the Stockosorb
 <sup>®</sup> and PSM applications were at a concentration of 0.2% and 0.3% (mixed with soil + root), respectively. Essential oil yield is directly related to the essential oil content (on the basis of g/100 g DW) and herb yield. In turn, herb yield depends on cultivar, harvest season, and soil water availability [

 <xref rid="B45-molecules-25-02503" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Essential oil yield in published articles on medicinal plants has been presented as kg/ha [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-25-02503" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] or mL/plant. The former depends on the number of plant/ha and is related to the plant density that is affected by geographical conditions, especially light intensity, whereas the latter could be presented in pot experiments or small plot research projects. In our study, the essential oil yields in different treatments were presented as mL/plant in the range of 0.06–0.21 mL/plant. Ichimura et al. (1995) [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-25-02503" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] by studying the effect of P fertilizer on the growth and essential oil yield of basil showed that phosphorus fertilizer could increase the essential oil yield from 0.006 to 0.04 mL/plant in spring and from 0.035 to 0.06 mL/plant in summer. A higher level of essential oil yield in our study could be related to the cultivar and climatic conditions. They did not express the basil cultivar in their research. Zheljazkov et al. (2008) [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-25-02503" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] studied 38 accessions of basil and reported an essential oil yield in the range of 3.1–58.8 kg/ha. The plant density in their study was near 3 plant/m

 <xref rid="B50-molecules-25-02503" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] showed that Stokosorb treatment prolonged the water supply to plant duration and increased growth in
