<p>According to the GC-MS analysis of the essential oils (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02503-f006">Figure 6</xref>), regardless of the method of application of HPs, linalool and eugenol (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02503-f006">Figure 6</xref>D,B) contents of basil essential oils increased and decreased, respectively. The methyl chavicol content of plants treated with PSM (in soil application methods) was stable (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02503-f006">Figure 6</xref>A), but application of Stockosorb
 <sup>®</sup> (in both methods) increased the constituent drastically. Plants treated with PSM (in both methods and in different concentrations) had a greater amount of major constituents of essential oil than Stockosorb
 <sup>®</sup>-treated plants. The highest amount of linalool (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02503-f006">Figure 6</xref>D) and methyl chavicol (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02503-f006">Figure 6</xref>A) was obtained in plants treated with PSM mixed only with soil at 0.1% and 0.2% concentrations, respectively. Plants treated with PSM mixed with soil + root (at 0.2% concentration) had the maximum 1,8-cineole (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02503-f006">Figure 6</xref>C). Timmerman et al. (1984) [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-25-02503" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] expressed, on the basis of more than 200 essential oil analysis reports, the maximum level of linalool synthesized in wet growing conditions in comparison to dry growing conditions. Bettaieb et al. (2009) [
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-25-02503" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] reported that the highest amount of 1,8 cineole was detected in mild drought stress, which was consistent with the results of this study. Therefore, increased 1,8 cineole and linalool constituents were due to applying the superabsorbent polymer and increasing water availability in the soil and root zone.
