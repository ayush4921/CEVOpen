<p>The results of analysis of variance indicated that essential oil content was significantly affected (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.01) by all treatments. The highest essential oil content was produced in plants treated with PSM and Stockosorb
 <sup>®</sup> at a concentration of 0.3%, and the lowest essential oil content (0.18%

 <sup>®</sup> increased essential oil content. The essential oil content of plants treated with PSM increased by increasing the PSM concentration mixed with soil, while it decreased when it mixed with soil + root (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02503-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Essential oil biosynthesis in herb was controlled by two main factors, endogenous and exogenous. The former related to the plant genetic characteristic but the latter related to environmental conditions such as light, temperature, nutrient level, and moisture. The exogenous factors may exert their effects directly or indirectly [
