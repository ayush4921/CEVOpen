<p>Results of the GC-MS analysis of the basil essential oil are shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-02503-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-02503-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. In total, 49 to 52 components were determined in the essential oil of basil treated with Stockosorb
 <sup>®</sup> mixed with soil + root that represented 98% of the essential oils. The major constituents of the essential oil in the samples were linalool (from 53.4% to 63.4%), 1,8-cineole (from 3.7% to 7.8%), epi-α-cadinol (from 5.1% to 5.9%), trans-α-bergamotene (from 2.7 to 3.1%), methyl chavicol or estragole (from 1.2% to 3.9%), and eugenol (from 2.1% to 2.5%) (

 <italic>O. basilicum</italic> treated with Stockosorb
 <sup>®</sup> mixed only with soil (98.5% of the total essential oils). The main constituents found in the essential oil of these samples were linalool (from 52.4% to 55.2%), 1,8-cineole (from 3.3% to 5.1%), epi-α-cadinol (from 4.98% to 6.6%), trans-α-bergamotene (from 3.5% to 5.3%), methyl chavicol (from 1.9% to 2.9%), and eugenol (from 2.8% to 4.9%) (

 <italic>O. basilicum</italic> treated with PSM mixed with soil + root, 35 to 46 constituents were determined (99% of the total essential oils), linalool (from 57.4% to 63.6%), 1,8-cineole (from 4.8% to 8.8%), epi-α-cadinol (from 4.2% to 5.3%), trans-α-bergamotene (from 3.5% to 5.3%), methyl chavicol (from 1.0% to 4.2%), and eugenol (from 2.3% to 3.1%), which are reported as the main components of volatile oils (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-02503-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). While in plants treated with PSM mixed only with soil (at 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.3% concentration), 41 to 50 constituents were observed (99% of the total essential oils) with the dominant components consisting of linalool (from 59.9% to 62.8%), 1,8-cineole (from 3.6% to 5.1%), epi-α-cadinol (from 3.8% to 6.2%), trans-α-bergamotene (from 2.1% to 2.4%), methyl chavicol (from 0.2% to 9.4%), and eugenol (from 1.3% to 3.6%) (
