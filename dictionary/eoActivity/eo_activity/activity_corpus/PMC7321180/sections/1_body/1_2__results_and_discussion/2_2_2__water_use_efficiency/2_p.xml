<p>According to the results of analysis of variance, in comparison to the control, all treatments increased water use efficiency (WUE) significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.01). For the soil application method, increasing the concentration of both PSM and Stockosorb
 <sup>®</sup> from zero (control) to 0.3% improved WUE (from 0.24 to 0.96 g DW/L H
 <sub>2</sub>O for STS and from 0.24 to 0.69 for PSM). We found Stockosorb
 <sup>®</sup> to be significantly superior to PSM in regard to WUE (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02503-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The WUE in soil + root application was higher than that of soil application in both PSM and Stockosorb
 <sup>®</sup>, and the PSM was superior to Stockosorb
 <sup>®</sup> except at the highest concentration (0.3%) where STS was better than PSM. The highest WUE (1.91 g/L) was observed in plants treated with PSM at a concentration of 0.1% (mixed with soil + root); furthermore, there was no significant difference with PSM at a concentration of 0.2% (mixed with soil + root) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02503-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The lowest WUE (0.24 g/L) resulted from the control plot. The application method of Stockosorb
 <sup>®</sup> had no significant effect on WUE, but in PSM, the method of application had a significant effect on the WUE with soil + root application, resulting in superior performance.
