<p>According to the result, the leaf area/plant was affected significantly by all treatments in comparison to the control treatment (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.01). In the soil application method, both hydrophilic materials increased the leaf area significantly, and at low (0.1%) and medium (0.2%) concentration, Stockosorb
 <sup>®</sup> was more efficient than PSM except at the highest concentration where there were no significant differences between Stockosorb
 <sup>®</sup> and PSM. In the soil + root application method, increasing the PSM concentration decreased the leaf area from 453.1 (in 0.1%) to 184.6 cm
 <sup>2</sup>/plant (in 0.3%). With low and medium concentrations of PSM, the leaf area was significantly higher than Stockosorb
 <sup>®</sup>-treated plants. The highest and the lowest leaf area (553.13 and 98.02 cm
 <sup>2</sup>/plant) were produced in plants treated with PSM (0.1% mixed with soil + root) and the control plot, respectively (

 <italic>Acacia victoriae</italic> [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-25-02503" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], soybean [

 <italic>Pinus halepensis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-02503" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Decreasing leaf area upon increasing the PSM concentration (in soil + root application method) may be related to the negative effect of this high concentration of PSM (0.2% and 0.3% PSM) for direct application on root, and it may be higher than the optimum concentration or more than the tolerant level of the basil root. Other possible explanations for getting this effect may be related to the induction of a high matric water potential effect around plant roots that belongs to the nature of the PSM. To the best of our knowledge, there is no report on the use of PSM on the soil + root of basil or other plants for comparison, and it may related to the concentration that needs more research for evaluating the lower concentration of PSM when applied on soil + root of basil. The soil + root application of hydrogel could be useful in the indirect cultivation of horticultural crops (seedling transplanting). By comparison to other evaluated factors, the 0.1% PSM is a good treatment, and more research needs to evaluate lower PSM concentrations. On the other hand, in the present work, nutrient uptake in different treatments was not evaluated, and much work remains to be done for determining the mode of action of the superabsorbent polymer on the leaf area
