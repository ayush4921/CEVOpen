<p>Lawrence (1988) [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-25-02503" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] classified four major essential oil chemotypes of basil: (1) methyl chavicol-rich, (2) linalool-rich, (3) methyl eugenol-rich, (4) methyl cinnamate-rich, and also numerous subtypes. Bruneton (1993) [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-25-02503" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] obtained results that were generally different to the literature findings concerning the major compounds. The observed differences might be the result of different growing environments, genetic factors, or chemotypes, as well as other potential factors that can influence the oil composition. Lee et al. (2005) [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-25-02503" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] reported that, regardless of environmental, genetic, or chemotype factors, 1,8-cineole, methyl cinnamate, methyl chavicol, and linalool are generally the main compounds responsible for the typical basil aroma [

 <xref rid="B56-molecules-25-02503" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] in three harvest times. They found that in all varieties and all harvest times, linalool was the main constituents (in the range of 39.8â€“75.5%). Simon et al. (1992) [
 <xref rid="B57-molecules-25-02503" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] evaluated the essential oil content and composition of sweet basil upon water stress treatments and confirmed that water stress affects the chemical composition of basil essential oil. They showed that the relative percentage of linalool and eugenol decreased in moderate stress in comparison to the control (from 29.5% to 16.3% and 4.3% to 0.1%, respectively) but methyl chavicol instead increased (from 30.3% to 49.9%). They finally concluded that even mild water stress can increase essential oil content and change the essential oil constituents. In the present research, by increasing the HP concentration (decreasing matric potential of water), the linalool content increased but eugenol decreased and the methyl chavicol content did not show a defined trend. The results may be related to the method of representing each constituent (relative percentage) that increases in one or two constituents should force the other constituents to decrease. For a deeper explanation of the effect of HP application on essential oil constituents, the evaluation of enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of each compound, and also independently measuring each compound content (not relative content), is necessary.
