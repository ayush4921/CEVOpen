<p>The effect of the treatments on total dry matter (biomass) was statistically significant (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.01). According to the results (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02503-f001">Figure 1</xref>), the lowest biomass (3.18 g/plant) was observed in the control plot and the highest biomass (10.42 g/plant) belonged to plants treated with psyllium seed mucilage (PSM) at a concentration of 0.1% (soil + root application). In Stockosorb
 <sup>®</sup> treatments, regardless of the method of application, the medium concentration (0.2%) produced higher biomass. In PSM treatments, increasing the concentration from 0.1% to 0.3% by soil application improved the biomass; however, in soil + root application, we observed a reversed trend with the highest biomass detected in lower concentrations of PSM, and there were no significant differences between 0.1% and 0.2% concentrations. There was no significant difference between biomass produced in the treatment of Stockosorb
 <sup>®</sup> mixed with soil + root and biomass produced in the plot treated with PSM at the concentration of 0.2% (soil + root application).
