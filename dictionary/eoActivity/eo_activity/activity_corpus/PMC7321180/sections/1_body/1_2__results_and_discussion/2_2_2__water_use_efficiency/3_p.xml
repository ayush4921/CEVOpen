<p>Hydrogel application by preventing water leaching from soil, decreasing evaporation and infiltration, improved the WUE [

Greenhouse crop producers also search for methods that could reduce the water requirement and also decrease the watering time during each production season. They use hydrogels or water-absorbent polymers in soil or soilless media such as holly, juniper, and azalea [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-25-02503" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Several authors confirmed an increase in irrigation efficiency through the application of superabsorbent polymers [

 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-02503" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The application of PSM in soil + root in comparison to the application in soil alone was more efficient for increasing the WUE. This is probably because of better water retention in the root zone.
