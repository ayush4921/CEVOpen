<p>Improving the physical and chemical properties of soil by the application of hydrogels was confirmed, as well as the increased water use potential during the establishment of crops [

 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-02503" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Improving the water holding capacity increased plant performance and yield in other agricultural crops such as millet [

 <xref rid="B36-molecules-25-02503" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The buffering environment and water conservation in soil upon application of hydrogel are the main reasons for increasing the plant dry weight after using these types of superabsorbent polymers [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-25-02503" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. It has also been claimed that hydrogel reduced the fertilizer leaching through interaction between the hydrogel and nutrient of fertilizers [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-25-02503" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In the present study, nutrient absorption was not evaluated, but the increase in the dry matter upon application of the superabsorbent indirectly showed the improved nutrient absorption. The increased yield of biomass after application of superabsorbent polymers has also been previously reported [

 <xref rid="B37-molecules-25-02503" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Application of hydrogel on the root (when applied as root dip only) coats the fine roots and protects the root against desiccation, especially after seedling transplanting. One explanation is that the hydrogel could act as natural root exudates and polymeric mucilage produced by healthy roots [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-25-02503" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Other researchers confirmed that root dip application of hydrogels weakens the water potential drop at the root–soil interface and decreases the energy needed to absorb water from soil [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-02503" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The method of the superabsorbent polymer also improves the root-to-soil contact and filling-in air space around seedling roots after transplanting [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-25-02503" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The optimum concentration is very important for obtaining fast results and decreasing the amount of hydro-absorbent needs for field unit area. In total, using the PSM mixed with soil + root improved dry matter more than using it only in soil, but for Stockosorb
 <sup>®</sup> (STS), it is better to use in soil. For cultural practices in horticulture, it will be easy to add synthetic HPs during soil preparation before plant cultivation when direct seeding is proposed, whereas, for indirect cultivation (seedling transplanting), soil + root application will be recommended. The method of application in soil depends on the cultivation system. In furrow cultivation, banding of the polymer needs only 46 kg ha
 <sup>−1</sup>. For fruit trees, several injection machines have been designed to apply dry polymers or hydrated polymers in the root zone [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-25-02503" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In greenhouse production of horticultural crops, nursery crops, seedling production, or rooted cutting, the method of application is adding to soil, soil + root, or soilless media [
