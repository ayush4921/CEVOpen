Inhibition of mTOR phosphorylation down regulates a serine protein kinase (Akt) involved in the regulation of the progression of cancer cells. The work suggests that the new developed nanocarrier for rapamycin could be used as radiosensitizer and could be used for local–regional or peripherical administration for the treatment of glioblastomas.
