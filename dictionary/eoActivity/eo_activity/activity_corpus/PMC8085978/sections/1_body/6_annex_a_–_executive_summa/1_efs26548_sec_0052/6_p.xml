<p>For the quantification of the phytochemical marker 
 <italic>naringin</italic> in 
 <italic>bitter orange extract of the whole fruit</italic> the Applicant submitted a single‐laboratory validated and further verified method based on HPLC‐UV (284 nm). The method has been developed for the determination of total flavonoids (including 
 <italic>naringin</italic> alone) in a mixture of citrus flavonoids. The quantification of 
 <italic>naringin</italic> is performed using the normalisation approach for the estimation of the area percentage of individual components. The Applicant provided validation and verification studies demonstrating the applicability of the method for the analysis of pure 
 <italic>naringin</italic>. Furthermore, 
 <italic>naringin</italic> has been satisfactory quantified in the 
 <italic>feed additive</italic> by the proposed method in 5 different lots of 
 <italic>bitter orange extract of the whole fruit</italic>.
