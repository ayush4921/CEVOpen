<p>For the quantification of the phytochemical markers 
 <italic>11‐keto-β‐boswellic acid</italic> and 
 <italic>3‐O-acetyl‐11-keto‐β‐boswellic acid</italic> in 
 <italic>olibanum extract (wb)</italic>, the Applicant submitted a method using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with spectrophotometric (UV) detection at 250 nm described in the European Pharmacopeia monograph for Indian Frankincense (Olibanum indicum). The quantification of 
 <italic>11‐keto-β‐boswellic acid</italic> and 
 <italic>3‐O-acetyl‐11-keto‐β‐boswellic acid</italic> is performed by means of specific expressions and is indicated as percentage content (absolute value). The Applicant, using the HPLC‐UV method, analysed 5 batches of the 
 <italic>feed additive</italic> obtaining results within the proposed specifications.
