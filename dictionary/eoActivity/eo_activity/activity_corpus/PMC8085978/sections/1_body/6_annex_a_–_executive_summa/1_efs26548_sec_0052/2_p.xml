 <italic>buchu leaves oil</italic> and 
 <italic>d窶人imonene</italic> in 
 <italic>orange terpenless (concentrated 10 times)</italic> oil, the Applicant submitted a method using gas chromatography coupled with flame ionisation detection (GC窶色ID) based on the generic standard ISO 11024. The quantification is performed by using the normalisation approach for the estimation of the area percentage of individual components. The Applicant tested the method, following an experimental design proposed by the EURL, and obtained satisfactory performance characteristics.
