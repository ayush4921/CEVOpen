 <list list-type="bullet" id="efs26548-list-0001">
  <list-item>
   <p>Expressed lemon oil is safe at the maximum proposed use level in complete feed of 40 mg/kg for turkeys for fattening, 90 mg/kg for veal calves, cattle for fattening and dairy cows, 30 mg/kg for sheep, goats and rabbits and 40 mg/kg for salmonids. For the other species, the calculated safe concentrations are 35 mg/kg for chickens for fattening, 52 mg/kg for laying hens, 62 mg/kg for piglets, 74 mg/kg for pigs for fattening, 92 mg/kg for sows and 137 mg/kg for horses. The use level in water for drinking of 10 mg/kg is safe for all animal species (except companion animals).</p>

  <list-item>
   <p>The residual fraction of expressed lemon oil is safe up to the maximum proposed use level in complete feed of 12 mg/kg for laying hens, turkeys for fattening, rabbits and salmonids, 20 mg/kg for ruminants and 35 mg/kg for horses. For the other species, the calculated safe concentrations are 11 mg/kg for chickens for fattening, 20 mg/kg for piglets, 24 mg/kg for pigs for fattening and 30 mg/kg for sows. The FEEDAP Panel considers that the use level in water for drinking is safe provided that the total daily intake of the additive does not exceed the daily amount that is considered safe when consumed via feed (except companion animals).</p>

   <p>The distilled fraction of expressed lemon oil is safe up to the maximum proposed use levels in complete feed of 95 mg/kg for veal calves, cattle for fattening, sheep and goats and 60 mg/kg for dogs, salmons and ornamental fish. For the other species, the calculated safe concentrations are 36 mg/kg for chickens for fattening, 53 mg/kg for laying hens, 48 mg/kg for turkeys for fattening, 64 mg/kg for piglets, 76 mg/kg for pigs for fattening, 94 mg/kg for sows, 91 mg/kg for dairy cows, 56 mg/kg for rabbits, 141 mg/kg for horses and 30 mg/kg for cats. The FEEDAP Panel considers that the use level in water for drinking is safe provided that the total daily intake of the additive does not exceed the daily amount that is considered safe when consumed via feed.</p>

   <p>Lime essential oil is safe up to the maximum proposed use levels in complete feed of 8.5 mg/kg for chickens for fattening, 12.5 mg/kg for laying hens, 11 mg/kg for turkeys for fattening, 15 mg/kg for piglets, 18 mg/kg for pigs for fattening, 22 mg/kg for lactating sows, 21.5 mg/kg for dairy cows, 33.5 mg/kg for cattle for fattening, sheep, goats and horses, 35.5 mg/kg for veal calves (milk replacers),13.5 mg/kg for rabbits, 30 mg/kg for salmons and ornamental fish. The FEEDAP Panel considers that the use level in water for drinking is safe (except companion animals).</p>
