<p>The product specification for the residual fraction is based on the concentrations (expressed as % of GC area) of the main volatile components, namely d‐limonene (51–63%, the phytochemical marker), γ‐terpinene (8–17%), geranial (6–12%), neral (5–9%), pin‐2(10)‐ene (0.3–5.5%) and β‐bisabolene (0.3–4.0%).
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="efs26548-note-1013">11</xref> Analysis of five batches of the additive showed compliance with these specifications with the exception of one batch, which showed a lower d‐limonene content and a higher γ‐terpinene content (Table 
 <xref rid="efs26548-tbl-0009" ref-type="table">9</xref>). These six compounds account for about 90.7% on average (range 85.0–92.9%) of the product, expressed as area % of the gas chromatographic (GC) profile.
