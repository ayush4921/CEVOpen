<p>Lachenmeier and Uebelacker (2010, unpublished report, as referenced in EMA 
 <xref rid="efs26548-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>) ‘have performed a detailed re‐evaluation of the available evidence using the benchmark dose (BMD) approach and found that the application of the appropriate dose‐response modelling on the long‐term chronic toxicity study of the NTP, using clonic seizures as a response, yielded a BMD lower confidence limit for a benchmark response of 10% (BMDL
 <sub>10</sub>) as 11 mg/kg body weight per day.’ Considering that the mixture tested contained 70% of α‐thujone, a BMDL
 <sub>10</sub> of 8 mg/kg bw per day is calculated for α‐thujone.
