<p>IARC (
 <xref rid="efs26548-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>) concluded that there is sufficient evidence in experimental animals and in humans for the carcinogenicity of 8‐MOP plus UVA radiation (Group 1). However, for 8‐MOP without UVA radiation, there is only limited evidence for the carcinogenicity in experimental animals. No epidemiological data relevant to the carcinogenicity of 5‐MOP were available, whereas on the basis of experiments designed to test the carcinogenicity to mouse skin of 5‐MOP (mainly dermal application) in combination with UVA radiation or solar‐simulated radiation, there is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals. The evidence is insufficient in the absence of UVA radiation. The overall evaluation was that 5‐MOP in the presence of UVA radiation is probably carcinogenic to humans (Group 2A; IARC
