<p>Concerning furocoumarins intake from food, in Great Britain, the furocoumarin intake has been estimated to be up to 1.2 mg per person per day corresponding to approximately 0.02 mg/kg bw per day for 60 kg bw (COT, 1996 as cited by SKLM, 
 <xref rid="efs26548-bib-0070" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). In Germany, the estimated average total daily intake of furocoumarins from non‚Äêflavoured and flavoured foods is approximately 0.56 mg/person per day (~ 0.01 mg/kg bw per day for 60 kg bw), flavoured foods contributing to about 10% to the total intake (SKLM,
