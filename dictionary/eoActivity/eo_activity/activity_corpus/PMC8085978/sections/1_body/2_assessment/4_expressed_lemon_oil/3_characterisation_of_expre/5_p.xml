<p>The applicant provided the full characterisation of the volatile constituents in 10 batches obtained by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC‐MS).
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="efs26548-note-1019">17</xref> In total, up to 88 constituents were detected, 71 of which were identified and accounted on average for 99.7% (99.5–99.9%) of the GC area. Besides the seven compounds indicated in the product specifications, 13 other compounds were detected at individual levels &gt; 0.1% and are listed in Table 
 <xref rid="efs26548-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>. These 20 compounds together account on average for 99.0% (98.4–99.3%) of the GC area. The remaining volatile 51 compounds (ranging between 0.002% and 0.1% and accounting together for &lt; 1%) are listed in the footnote.
