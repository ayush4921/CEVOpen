<p>As summarised by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in the public statement on the use of herbal medicinal products containing thujone (EMA, 
 <xref rid="efs26548-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>), ‘Metabolism of thujone has been investigated in mouse, rat and human liver preparations 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and in mice, rats and (partially) rabbits 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Hydroxylation occurs at various positions, mainly at 7‐ and 4‐positions, followed to a different extent by glucuronidation, and reductions as minor reactions are principal metabolic pathways, although 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> metabolic profiles do not necessarily agree with each other (Ishida et al., 
 <xref rid="efs26548-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">1989</xref>; Höld et al., 
 <xref rid="efs26548-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>, 
 <xref rid="efs26548-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>). After 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> liver microsomal incubations with α‐thujone, 7‐hydroxy‐α‐thujone seems to be a major metabolite in mice, rats and humans, whereas with β‐thujone, formation of 4‐hydroxy‐β‐thujone exceeded that of the 7‐hydroxymetabolite in all species. 2‐Hydroxy‐thujone was observed only in mouse liver microsomes.’ (…) ‘In mice, treated orally with α‐thujone 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, 2‐hydroxy‐α‐thujone (mostly as a glucuronide) was the principal metabolite in urine, whereas 7‐hydroxy‐β‐thujone was by far the most abundant urinary metabolite after β‐thujone administration. In the rat, 4‐hydroxythujones were principal urinary metabolites after administration of thujones (Höld et al.,
