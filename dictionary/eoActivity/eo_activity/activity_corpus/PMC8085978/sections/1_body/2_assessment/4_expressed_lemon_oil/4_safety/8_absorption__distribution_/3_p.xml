<p>Perillaldehyde is quickly metabolised, largely by oxidation of the side chain to a carboxylic acid, which is excreted unchanged and as conjugates (WHO, 
 <xref rid="efs26548-bib-0072" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>). Perillaldehyde is also an intermediate metabolite arising from the oxidation of the methyl side chain of limonene to perillic acid and dihydroperillic acid, which are further conjugated with glucuronic acid and excreted as perillyl‐glucuronide and dihydroperillyl‐glucuronide (reviewed in EFSA FEEDAP Panel,
