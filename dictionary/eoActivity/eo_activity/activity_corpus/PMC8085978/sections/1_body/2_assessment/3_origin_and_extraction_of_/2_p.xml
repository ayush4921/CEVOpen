<p>The taxonomy and systematics of the 
 <italic>Citrus</italic> genus, belonging to the Rutaceae family, are complex and the exact number of natural species is unclear. Almost all of the common commercially important citrus fruits found today are hybrids derived from three ancestral species now represented by the cultivars described as the mandarin, pomelo and citron. Thus, lemon is a natural hybrid of citron (
 <italic>Citrus medica</italic>) and the sour orange (
 <italic>Citrus aurantium</italic>), which is itself derived from a cross made with pomelo (
 <italic>Citrus maxima</italic>). The currently preferred botanical name for lemon is 
 <italic>Citrus limon</italic> (L.) Osbeck but the isonym 
 <italic>C. limon</italic> (L.) Burm. f. is still widely used. Limes form a more diverse series of hybrids than lemons with at least five distinct groups recognised. The present application concerns an extract made from limes belonging to ‘small fruit acid limes’ (
 <italic>C. aurantiifolia</italic> (Christm.) Swingle).
