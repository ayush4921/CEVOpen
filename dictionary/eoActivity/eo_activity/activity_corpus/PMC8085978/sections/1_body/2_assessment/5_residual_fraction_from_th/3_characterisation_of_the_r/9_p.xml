<p>Data on chemical and microbial impurities were provided in three batches of the residual fraction.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="efs26548-note-1053">51</xref> The concentrations of heavy metals were below the corresponding LOQ, with the exception of cadmium in one batch (0.08 mg/kg). In the same batches, mycotoxins (aflatoxins B1, B2, G1 and G2) were below the LOQ and pesticides were not detected in a multiresidue analysis with the exception of endosulfan (0.029–0.032 mg/kg), endosulfan sulfate (0.033 mg/kg), chlorpyrifos ethyl (0.63–0.70 mg/kg) and 2‐phenylphenol (3.2–3.9 mg/kg). In the same batches, PCDD, PCDF and PCBs were below the corresponding LOQ and the calculated upper bond for the sum of the WHO PCCD/F + PCB TEQ ranged between 1.67 and 1.87 pg/g fat. None of the data on chemical impurities raised concerns.
