<p>This application concerns the essential oil obtained by steam distillation from unpeeled fruits of the plant species 
 <italic>C. aurantiifolia</italic> (Christm.) Swingle from a single origin (Mexico). Briefly, lime fruits are pressed, and the peels are removed. Steam is passed through the remaining lime juice and oil. The steam carries up the volatile constituents which are condensed. The essential oil is then separated from water by decantation.
