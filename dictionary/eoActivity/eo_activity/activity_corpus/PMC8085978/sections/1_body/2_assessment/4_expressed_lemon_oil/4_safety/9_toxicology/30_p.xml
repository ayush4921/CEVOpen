<p>As summarised in the toxicological assessment performed by SKLM (SKLM, 
 <xref rid="efs26548-bib-0069" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>), limited data are available on the subchronic toxicity of furocoumarins. When 8‐MOP was tested in a 90‐day study in rats at daily doses of 0, 25, 50, 100, 200 or 400 mg/kg bw per day, in the absence of UV light, a dose‐dependent increase in the relative liver weight was observed at all doses tested. At the two highest doses tested, several adverse effects were observed, including increased mortality, reduced body weight, lipid deposits in the liver and the adrenal glands, atrophy of the prostate, seminal vesicles and the seminiferous tubules (Dunnik et al., 1984, as reported in SKLM, 
 <xref rid="efs26548-bib-0069" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>; NTP, 
 <xref rid="efs26548-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">1989</xref>). Other studies with 5‐MOP in dogs and rats were considered insufficient to identify an NOAEL. From the available data, the SKLM concluded that a NOAEL for the repeated intake of furocoumarins could not be identified.
