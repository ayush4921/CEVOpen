<p>The applicant submitted published reviews on the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) of furocoumarins and methoxycoumarins (

 <xref rid="efs26548-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Generally, furocoumarins are well and rapidly absorbed, both in experimental animals and humans. Some of the furocoumarins present in the additive under assessment, i.e. psoralen, 5‐MOP, 8‐MOP, oxypeucedanin and imperatorin, were administered by the oral route to rats at 10 mg/kg body weight (bw), and their presence in plasma analysed by GC‐MS. The T
 <sub>max</sub> ranged between 0.5 h and 2 h and the highest concentrations were lower than 10 μg/mL (Zhao et al., 2013, as referenced in Kozioł and Skalicka‐Woźniak,
