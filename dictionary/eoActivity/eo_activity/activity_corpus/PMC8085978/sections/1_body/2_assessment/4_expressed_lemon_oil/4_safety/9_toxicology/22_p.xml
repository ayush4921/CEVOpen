<p>In a reproductive toxicity study reported by the same authors (Caldas et al., 
 <xref rid="efs26548-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>), pregnant rats were randomly distributed into eight groups (n = 7–10 per group), four of which were assigned to treatment during the preimplantation period (day 1–6 of pregnancy) and four to treatment during organogenesis (day 7–14 of pregnancy). In both periods, the control group received a 1% Tween‐80 aqueous solution (0.1 mL/10 g), while the treated groups received 1,8 cineole by gavage at doses of 250, 500 or 1,000 mg/kg bw per day for 7 days. High‐dose females gained significantly less weight during the treatment period and this was associated with a higher level of dead fetuses and lower total fetus mass in the preimplantation group. The study suggests that possibly 1,8‐cineole presents maternal and fetal toxicity at doses ≥ 250 mg/kg bw.
