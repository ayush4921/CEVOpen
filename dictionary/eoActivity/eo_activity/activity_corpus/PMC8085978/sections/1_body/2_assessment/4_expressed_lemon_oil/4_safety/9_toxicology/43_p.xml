<p>Furocoumarins are genotoxic 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo,</italic> especially in combination with UVA radiation. In the absence of UVA radiation, the potency is low. Linear furocoumarins in combination with UVA radiation are carcinogenic in rats and mice. Dietary furocoumarin exposures of the general population below the phototoxicity threshold dose have not been associated with an additional risk of skin cancer. The available carcinogenicity data (both in humans and experimental animals) are not suitable for benchmark dose modelling and no reference point can be calculated to be used in a quantitative risk assessment of oral furocoumarin exposure.
