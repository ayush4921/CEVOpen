<p>The product specification for the distilled fraction is based on the concentrations (expressed as % of GC area) of the main components, namely d‐limonene (66–78%, the phytochemical marker), pin‐2(10)‐ene (5–20%), α‐terpinene (1.5–9.5%), pin‐2(3)‐ene (0.5–3.0%) and or sabinene (0.5–3.0%). Analysis of five batches of the additive
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="efs26548-note-1013">11</xref> showed compliance with these specifications (Table 
 <xref rid="efs26548-tbl-0016" ref-type="table">16</xref>). These five compounds account for about 90.7% on average (range 85.0–92.9%) of the product, expressed as area % of GC area.
