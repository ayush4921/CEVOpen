<p>Furocoumarins are extensively biotransformed predominantly in the liver via cytochrome P450 (CYP)‐dependent monooxygenases and excreted mainly in urine. In mice and humans, more than 90% of an orally administered dose of 8‐MOP was found within 12 h as metabolites in the urine. The main biotransformation pathways are epoxidation, hydroxylation, glucuronide conjugation and hydrolytic opening of the lactone ring (SKLM,

By using an LC/time of flight (TOF) mass spectrometry system, the extensive metabolism of imperatorin was confirmed and 51 metabolites were identified in urine of rats after a single oral administration of 80 mg/kg bw (Qiao et al., 2013, as referenced in Kozioł and Skalicka‐Woźniak, 
 <xref rid="efs26548-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Several metabolic pathways were proposed, mainly oxidation, cleavage of side chain and ring hydrolysis followed by conjugation reactions with sulfate and glucuronide.
