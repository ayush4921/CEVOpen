<p>At the proposed use levels for the different species, the lowest MOET is ≥ 151. Therefore, with respect to the exposure to the volatiles present in the additive, no safety concern was identified for lime oil when used as a feed additive at the proposed use levels except for cats. Owing to the unusually low capacity for glucuronidation in cats (Court and Greenblatt, 
 <xref rid="efs26548-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">1997</xref>), safe concentration in feed should be reduced to 10 mg/kg to ensure an MOET of about 500. No specific proposals have been made by the applicant for the use level in water for drinking. Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel considered the same use level in water for drinking as proposed for feed. When used in water for drinking, the intake of the additive via water would be two to three times higher than the intake via feed for poultry, pigs and rabbits (EFSA FEEDAP Panel, 
 <xref rid="efs26548-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). The Panel considers that the use level in water for drinking is safe.
