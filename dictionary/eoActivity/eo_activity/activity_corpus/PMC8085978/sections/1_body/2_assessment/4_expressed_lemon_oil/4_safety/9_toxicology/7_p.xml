<p>As summarised by EMA (

 <xref rid="efs26548-bib-0060" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>, TR No. 570), the genotoxic potential of racemic thujone
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="efs26548-note-1029">27</xref> (used in the carcinogenicity study) and α‐thujone were investigated according to the NTP protocols. The Ames test results of both compounds were negative in the presence or absence of the activating enzyme system. 
 <italic>In vivo</italic>, daily exposure by gavage to racemic thujone (6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 or 75 mg (α,β‐thujone/kg bw) for 3 months did not result in an increase in micronucleated erythrocytes in the peripheral blood of male B6C3F1 mice. However, female mice had a small but significant increase in micronucleated erythrocytes in the peripheral blood at the end of the 3‐month study. Racemic thujone did not induce bone marrow toxicity.’
