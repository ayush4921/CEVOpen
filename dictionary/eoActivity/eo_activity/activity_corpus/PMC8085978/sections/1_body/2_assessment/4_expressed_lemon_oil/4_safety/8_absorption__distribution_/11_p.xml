<p>Furocoumarins from grapefruit juice have been reported to inhibit CYPs, especially CYP3A4 at the intestine level, and to compete for substrate binding, increasing the bioavailability of drugs metabolised by these enzymes (Meluogh and Chun, 
 <xref rid="efs26548-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). On the other hand, furocoumarins have been reported to induce hepatic glutathione S‐transferases (GSTs) and CYP activities in mice. Particularly, the linear furocoumarins bergamottin and isopimpinellin have the potential to induce substantially increased the activity of hepatic murine CYP2B and CYP3A, suggesting a modulating effect of furocoumarins on hepatic drug‐metabolising enzymes depending on their chemical structure (Kleiner et al.,
