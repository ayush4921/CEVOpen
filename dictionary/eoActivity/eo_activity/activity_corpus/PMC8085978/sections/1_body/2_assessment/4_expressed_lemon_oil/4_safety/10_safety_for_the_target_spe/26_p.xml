 <xref rid="efs26548-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>), the occurrence of perillaldehyde in lemon by‐products was estimated to be 0.0002%. Based on citrus by‐product intake (see above), the intake of perillaldehyde via feed was calculated to be 16 μg/kg bw for poultry, 18 μg/kg bw for pigs, 12 μg/kg bw for ruminants, 8 μg/kg bw for horses, 20 μg/kg bw for rabbit and 7 μg/kg bw for fish.
