<p>The approach followed, i.e. the allocation of the components to the (sub‐)assessment groups, the estimate of exposure for the target species, the identification of a reference point for each constituent (hazard characterisation) and the calculation of the MOET for each assessment group (risk characterisation), is described in Section 
 <xref rid="efs26548-sec-0017" ref-type="sec">3.2.2.3</xref>. The compounds resulting individually in an MOE &gt; 50,000 were not further considered in the assessment group as their contribution to the MOE(T) is negligible.
