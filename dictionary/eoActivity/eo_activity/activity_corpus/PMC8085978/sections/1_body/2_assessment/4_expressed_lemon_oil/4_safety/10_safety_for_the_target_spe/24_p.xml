<p>Low concentrations of perillaldehyde were detected in one batch of the additive under assessment (0.023%). The use of expressed lemon oil at the proposed use levels in feed would result in a perillaldehyde intake up to 0.8 μg/kg bw for poultry, 0.9 μg/kg bw for pigs, 0.7 μg/kg bw for ruminants, 0.8 μg/kg bw for horses, 0.4 μg/kg bw for rabbit and 0.2 μg/kg bw for fish.
