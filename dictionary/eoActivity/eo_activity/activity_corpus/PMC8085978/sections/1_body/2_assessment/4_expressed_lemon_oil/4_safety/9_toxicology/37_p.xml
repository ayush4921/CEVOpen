<p>From exposure studies in adult volunteers, it is concluded that the oral threshold dose for furocoumarin mixtures for the induction of erythemas in combination with sunlight is in the order of 10 mg 8‐MOP plus 10 mg 5‐MOP or 15 mg 8‐MOP equivalents (0.25 mg/kg bw for 60 kg bw, corresponding to blood levels of 8‐MOP and 5‐MOP at 30 min after intake of approximately 10–15 ng/ml each) (Schlatter et al., 1991, as referenced in SKLM, 2006). This phototoxic threshold dose was not reached by normal conventional dietary intake of vegetables, such as celery roots (experimental intake of 2–8 mg furocoumarin mixture per person resulting in blood levels of 8‐MOP and 5‐MOP which were below the limit of detection (LOD) of 2 ng/ml) (Schlatter et al., 1991 as referenced in SKLM,
