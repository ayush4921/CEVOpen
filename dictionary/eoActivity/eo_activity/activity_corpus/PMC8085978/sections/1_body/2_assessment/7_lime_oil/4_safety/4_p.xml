<p>Among the volatile components, 24 substances have not been previously assessed for use as flavourings. The FEEDAP Panel notes that they are aliphatic mono‐ or sesquiterpenes structurally related to flavourings already assessed in CG 31 and 8 and a similar metabolic and toxicological profile is expected. These lipophilic compounds are expected to be rapidly absorbed from the gastro‐intestinal tract, oxidised to polar oxygenated metabolites, conjugated and excreted (EFSA FEEDAP Panel,

For 10 out of the 24 compounds (γ‐eudesmol, α‐cadinol, 3‐methylene‐1,5,5‐trimethylcyclohexene, (3R‐trans)‐3‐methyl‐6‐(1‐methylvinyl)cyclohexene, cis‐α‐bergamotene, (E)‐α‐bergamotene, 1,1,7‐trimethyltricyclo[2.2.1.0.(2.6)]heptane, α‐fenchene, 3,7,10‐humulatriene and germacrene B), the genotoxic potential of the was predicted using the OECD QSAR Toolbox.
