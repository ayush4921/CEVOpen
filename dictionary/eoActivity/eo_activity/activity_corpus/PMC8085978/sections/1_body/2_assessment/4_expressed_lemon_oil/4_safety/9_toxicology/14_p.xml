<p>The carcinogenicity of 8‐MOP without UVA irradiation was studied in F344/N rats (males and females) given oral doses of 0, 37.5 or 75 mg/kg per day for 5 days a week for a total of 103 weeks (NTP, 
 <xref rid="efs26548-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">1989</xref>). Treated male rats showed significantly increased numbers of tubular cell hyperplasia, adenomas and adenocarcinomas of the kidney and of Zymbal gland carcinomas but without dose dependency.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="efs26548-note-1032">30</xref> There was a positive trend in the occurrence of alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas as well as of subcutaneous tissue fibroadenomas. No increase in tumour incidences were observed in treated females. The carcinogenicity data in male rats are not suitable for benchmark dose modelling as only two doses were tested and both doses led to a similar increase of the tumour incidence. Therefore, there is little dose‐response information in these data and no reference point can be calculated to be used in a quantitative risk assessment of oral furocoumarin exposure.
