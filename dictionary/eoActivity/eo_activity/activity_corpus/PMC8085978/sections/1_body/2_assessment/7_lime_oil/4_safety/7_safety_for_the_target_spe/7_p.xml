<p>As shown in Table 
 <xref rid="efs26548-tbl-0022" ref-type="table">22</xref>, for all the assessment groups, the MOET was ≥ 100. Therefore, no safety concern was identified for lime essential oil when used as a feed additive for chickens for fattening at the proposed use levels (8.5 mg/kg). From the lowest MOET of 350 for chickens for fattening, the MOET was calculated for the other target species considering the respective daily feed intake and conditions of use. The results are summarised in Table
