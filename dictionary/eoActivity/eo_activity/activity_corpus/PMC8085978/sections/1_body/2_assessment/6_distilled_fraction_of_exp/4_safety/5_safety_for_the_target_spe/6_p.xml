<p>Table 
 <xref rid="efs26548-tbl-0019" ref-type="table">19</xref> shows an MOET below the value of 100 for poultry, pigs, dairy cows, rabbits and horses. In order to ensure an MOET ≥ 100, the concentration in feed should be reduced to 36 mg/kg for chickens for fattening, 53 mg/kg for laying hens, 48 mg/kg for turkeys for fattening, 64 mg/kg for piglets, 76 mg/kg for pigs for fattening, 94 mg/kg for sows, 91 mg/kg for dairy cows, 56 mg/kg for rabbits and 141 mg/kg for horses. For the other species, the FEEDAP Panel concludes that the use of the distilled fraction at the maximum proposed use levels in feed is safe for all animal species, except for cats. Owing to the unusually low capacity for glucuronidation in cats (Court and Greenblatt, 
 <xref rid="efs26548-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">1997</xref>), safe concentration in feed should be reduced to 30 mg/kg to ensure an MOET of about 500. No specific proposals have been made by the applicant for the use level in water for drinking. Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel considered the same use level in water for drinking as proposed for feed. When used in water for drinking, the intake of the additive via water would be two to three times higher than the intake via feed for poultry, pigs and rabbits (EFSA FEEDAP Panel, 
 <xref rid="efs26548-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). The Panel considers that the use level in water for drinking is safe provided that the total daily intake of the additive does not exceed the daily amount that is considered safe when consumed via feed.
