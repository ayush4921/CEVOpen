<p>After oral administration of 40 mg of 
 <sup>14</sup>C labelled 8‐MOP to humans, the plasma T
 <sub>max</sub> was achieved about 2 h after dosing and the radioactivity recovery in urine was 74% within 48 h and 14% in faeces after 3 days (Busch et al., 1978, as referenced in Melough et al., 
 <xref rid="efs26548-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2018a</xref>). Data on oral absorption in humans indicate that bioavailability and kinetics vary greatly between individuals and cannot be predicted (Herfst and De Wolff, 1982, as referenced in SKLM,
