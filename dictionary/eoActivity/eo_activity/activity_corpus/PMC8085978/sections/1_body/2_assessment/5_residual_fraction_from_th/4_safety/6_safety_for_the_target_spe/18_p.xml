<p>The FEEDAP Panel concludes that the residual fraction of expressed lemon oil is safe up to the maximum proposed use level in complete feed of 12 mg/kg for laying hens, turkeys for fattening, rabbits and salmonids, 20 mg/kg for ruminants and 35 mg/kg for horses. For the other species, the calculated safe concentrations are 11 mg/kg for chickens for fattening, 20 mg/kg for piglets, 24 mg/kg for pigs for fattening and 30 mg/kg for sows. These target species are fed citrus by‐products as part of daily feed. For these species, the use of the residual fraction of expressed lemon oil in feed is not expected to increase the exposure to furocoumarins and methoxycoumarins and perillaldehyde to a relevant extent (&lt; 10%). For companion animals and ornamental fish not normally exposed to citrus by‐products, no conclusion can be drawn.</p>
