<p>Table 
 <xref rid="efs26548-tbl-0006" ref-type="table">6</xref> shows an MOET below the value of 100 for chickens for fattening, laying hens, pigs and horses. In order to ensure an MOET ≥ 100, the concentration in feed should be reduced to 35 mg/kg for chickens for fattening, 52 mg/kg for laying hens, 62 mg/kg for piglets, 74 mg/kg for pigs for fattening, 92 mg/kg for sows and 137 mg/kg for horses. For the other species, the MOET is close to or exceeds the value of 100 at the maximum proposed concentrations. This excludes a concern for the target species arising from the volatile components of expressed lemon oil (except perillaldehyde). Because glucuronidation is an important metabolic reaction to facilitate the excretion of these compounds (see Section 
 <xref rid="efs26548-sec-0015" ref-type="sec">3.2.2.1</xref>), their use as additives in cat feed needs a wider margin of exposure. Considering that cats have an unusually low capacity for glucuronidation (Court and Greenblatt, 
 <xref rid="efs26548-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">1997</xref>), an MOET of 500 is considered adequate.
