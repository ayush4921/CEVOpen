<p>In another study (Xu et al., 
 <xref rid="efs26548-bib-0074" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>), groups of 10 mice of undefined sex were given 1,8 cineole in solution daily by gavage for 30 days to provide doses of 0, 21.38, 64.15 or 192.45 mg/kg per day. Examination included daily observation, body weight, food and water intakes; organ weights and gross and microscopic pathology. No changes in body weight gain and the absolute and relative weight of organs were observed in treated mice compared to controls. Histopathological examination showed that the highest dose (192.5 mg/kg per day) of 1,8‐cineole caused serious damages in liver and kidneys, with main lesions of granular and vacuolar degeneration and vascular congestion, whereas the two lower doses (21.4 and 64.2 mg/kg per day) caused no or only mild such damages in liver and kidneys. Due to the limitations in the study design and the limited background knowledge of the mice used, this kind of studies does not allow to derive an NOAEL, but the FEEDAP Panel considers that the results confirm the liver and the kidneys as target organs, similar as in the rat study.
