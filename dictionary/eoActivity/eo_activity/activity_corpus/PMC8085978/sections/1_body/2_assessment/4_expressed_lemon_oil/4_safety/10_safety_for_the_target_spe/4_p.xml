<p>As the additive under assessment is sufficiently characterised (&gt; 99.5%), the FEEDAP Panel applied a component‐based approach to assess the safety for target species of the volatile constituents (except perillaldehyde) of expressed lemon oil. For furocoumarins and citropten, the only methoxycoumarin congener detected in the additive and therefore considered as representative for the class, their toxicological properties and the available data set do not allow to identify a reference point for the risk assessment or to derive a safe level. On the other hand, feeding animals citrus by‐products is a common practice with no report of adverse effects (Bampidis and Robinson,

 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="efs26548-note-1040">38</xref>). Therefore, the assessment of the safety for target species is based on the comparison between the combined furocoumarin and citropten intake via the consumption of citrus by‐products as feed material and that via the use of lemon essential oil as a feed additive. The same approach is applied for perillaldehyde, occurring in citrus peel.
