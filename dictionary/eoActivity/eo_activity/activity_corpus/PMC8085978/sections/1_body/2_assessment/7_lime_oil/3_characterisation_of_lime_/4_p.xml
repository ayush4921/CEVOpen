<p>The product specification for lime essential oil is based on the concentrations (expressed as % of GC area) of the main components, namely d‐limonene (45–52%, the phytochemical marker), α‐terpinene (10–14%), terpinolene (5.5–10.5%), α‐terpineol (6–8%) and β‐caryophyllene (0.2–0.8%). Analysis of five batches of the additive showed compliance with these specifications when analysed by GC‐FID.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="efs26548-note-1062">60</xref> When analysed by GC‐MS, these five compounds account for about 74.8% on average (range 73.7–76.3%) of the product, expressed as area % of the GC profile (Table 
 <xref rid="efs26548-tbl-0020" ref-type="table">20</xref>). The FEEDAP Panel notes that the concentration of d‐limonene determined by GC‐MS was underestimated, resulting in higher concentration of the other constituents.
