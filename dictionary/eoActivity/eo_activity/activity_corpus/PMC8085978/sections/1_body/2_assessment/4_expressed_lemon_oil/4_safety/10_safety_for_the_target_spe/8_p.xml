<p>For hazard characterisation, each component of an assessment group was first assigned to the structural class according to Cramer classification. For some components in the assessment group, toxicological data were available to derive NOAEL values. Structural and metabolic similarity among the components in the assessment groups was assessed to explore the application of read‐across allowing extrapolation from a known NOAEL of a component of an assessment group to the other components of the group with no available NOAEL or, if sufficient evidence were available for members of a (sub‐)assessment group, to derive a (sub‐)assessment group NOAEL.</p>
