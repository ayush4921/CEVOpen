 <xref rid="efs26548-tbl-0018" ref-type="table">18</xref>, for all the assessment groups, the MOET calculated for chickens for fattening at the proposed use level of 40 mg/kg complete feed was ≥ 89. From the lowest MOET of 89 for chickens for fattening, the MOET was calculated for the other target species considering the respective daily feed intake and conditions of use. The results are summarised in Table
