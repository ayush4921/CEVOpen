<p>Six compounds, δ‐cadinene [01.021], β‐cubebene [01.030], δ‐germacrene [01.042], 3,7,10‐humulatriene [01.043], β‐phellandrene [01.055] and tricyclene [01.060], evaluated in FGE25.Rev2 by applying the Procedure described in the Guidance on the data required for the risk assessment of flavourings to be used in or on food (EFSA CEF Panel, 
 <xref rid="efs26548-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). For these compounds, for which there is no concern for genotoxicity, EFSA requested additional toxicity data (EFSA CEF Panel, 
 <xref rid="efs26548-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2011c</xref>). In the absence of such toxicological data, the EFSA CEF Panel was unable to complete its assessment. As a result, these compounds are no longer authorised for use as flavours in food. In the absence of toxicity data, the FEEDAP Panel applies the threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) approach (EFSA FEEDAP Panel, 
 <xref rid="efs26548-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2017b</xref>) or read‐across from structurally related substances.
