<p>As the distilled fraction of expressed lemon oil is sufficiently characterised (&gt; 99.9%), the FEEDAP Panel applied a component‐based approach to assess the safety for target species. The approach followed, i.e. the allocation of the components to the (sub‐)assessment groups, the estimate of exposure for the target species, the identification of a reference point for each constituent (hazard characterisation) and the calculation of the MOET for each assessment group (risk characterisation), is described in Section 
 <xref rid="efs26548-sec-0017" ref-type="sec">3.2.2.3</xref>. The compounds resulting individually in an MOE &gt; 50,000 were not further considered in the assessment group as their contribution to the MOE(T) is negligible.
