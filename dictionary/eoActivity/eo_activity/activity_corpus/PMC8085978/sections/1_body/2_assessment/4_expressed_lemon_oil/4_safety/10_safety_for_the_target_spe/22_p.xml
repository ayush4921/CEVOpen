<p>When used in water for drinking, the intake of the additive via water would be two to three times higher than the intake via feed for poultry, pigs and rabbits (EFSA FEEDAP Panel, 
 <xref rid="efs26548-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). The applicant proposed a maximum use level of 10 mg/kg for the use in water for drinking, which would ensure a comparable or lower exposure. Therefore, the FEEDAP PanelÂ concludes that with respect to the exposure to the volatiles present in the additive the use of expressed lemon oil at the maximum proposed use levels in feed and in water for drinking is safe for all animal species.
