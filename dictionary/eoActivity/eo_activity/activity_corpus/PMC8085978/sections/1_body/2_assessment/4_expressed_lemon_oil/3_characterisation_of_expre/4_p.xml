 <italic>C. limon</italic>,
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="efs26548-note-1018">16</xref> which were adapted to reflect the concentrations expressed as % of gas chromatographic peak area (% GC area) of the main volatile components of the essential oil, namely d‐limonene (60–73%, the phytochemical marker), pin‐2(10)‐ene (hereinafter referred to as β‐pinene, 9–18%), γ‐terpinene (6–12%), pin‐2(3)‐ene (hereinafter referred to as α‐pinene, 1.3–3.0%), 4(10)‐thujene (hereinafter referred to as sabinene, 0.5–3.0%), trans‐3,7‐dimethylocta‐2,6‐dienal (hereinafter referred to as geranial, 0.1–2%) and neral (cis‐3,7‐dimethylocta‐2,6‐dienal, 0.1–1.8%). Analysis of 10 batches of the additive
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="efs26548-note-1015">13</xref> showed compliance with these specifications (Table 
 <xref rid="efs26548-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). These seven compounds account for about 94.2% on average (range 92.4–95.5%) of % GC area.
