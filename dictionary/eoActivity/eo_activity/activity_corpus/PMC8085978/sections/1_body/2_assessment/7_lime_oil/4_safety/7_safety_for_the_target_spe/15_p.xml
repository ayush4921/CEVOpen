<p>The FEEDAP Panel concludes that the lime oil is safe up to the maximum proposed use level in complete feed of 8.5 mg/kg for chickens for fattening, 12.5 mg/kg for laying hens, 11 mg/kg for turkeys for fattening, 15 mg/kg for piglets, 18 mg/kg for pigs for fattening, 22 mg/kg for lactating sows, 21.5 mg/kg for dairy cows, 33.5 mg/kg for cattle for fattening, sheep, goats and horses, 35.5 mg/kg for veal calves (milk replacers), 13.5 mg/kg for rabbits and 30 mg/kg for salmonids. These target species are fed citrus by‐products as part of daily feed. For these species, the use of the lime oil in feed is not expected to increase the exposure to furocoumarins and methoxycoumarins to a relevant extent (&lt; 1%). For companion animals and ornamental fish not normally exposed to citrus by‐products, no conclusion can be drawn.</p>
