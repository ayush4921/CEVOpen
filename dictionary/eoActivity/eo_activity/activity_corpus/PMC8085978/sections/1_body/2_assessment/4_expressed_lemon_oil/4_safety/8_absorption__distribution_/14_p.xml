<p>No specific data exist about the ADME of methoxycoumarins. Because of its lipophilic nature, it is expected that citropten is also rapidly and completely absorbed after oral uptake and distributed to tissues. It is assumed that the same metabolic pathways that are relevant for furocoumarins, such as demethylation followed by conjugation also apply to methoxycoumarins, such as citropten.</p>
