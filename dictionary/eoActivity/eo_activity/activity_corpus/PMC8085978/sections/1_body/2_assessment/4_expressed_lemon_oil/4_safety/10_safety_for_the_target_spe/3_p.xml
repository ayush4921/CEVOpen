<p>In the absence of these data, the approach to the safety assessment of a mixture whose individual components are known is based on the safety assessment of each individual component (component‚Äêbased approach). This approach requires that the mixture is sufficiently characterised. The individual components can be grouped into assessment groups, based on structural and metabolic similarity. The combined toxicity can be predicted using the dose addition assumption within an assessment group, taking into account the relative toxic potency of each component.</p>
