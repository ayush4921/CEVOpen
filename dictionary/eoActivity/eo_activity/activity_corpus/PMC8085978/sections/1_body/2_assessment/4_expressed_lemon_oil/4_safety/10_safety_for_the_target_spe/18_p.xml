<p>For risk characterisation, the margin of exposure (MOE) was calculated for each component as the ratio between the reference point and the exposure. For each assessment group, the combined (total) margin of exposure (MOET) was calculated as the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals of the MOE of the individual substances (EFSA Scientific Committee, 
 <xref rid="efs26548-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2019a</xref>). An MOET &gt; 100 allowed for interspecies‐ and intra‐individual variability (as in the default 10 × 10 uncertainty factor). The compounds resulting individually in an MOE &gt; 50,000 were not further considered in the assessment group as their contribution to the MOE(T) is negligible.
