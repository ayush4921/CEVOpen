<p>Mutagenicity, chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) have been observed with 8‐MOP in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in the dark. Exposure of CHO cells treated with 5‐MOP and 8‐MOP to UVA leads to the formation of DNA adducts, DNA‐interstrand crosslinks, SCE and mutations. Raquet and Schrenk (
 <xref rid="efs26548-bib-0064" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) compared the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of a combined treatment of 5‐MOP, 8‐MOP, angelicin and citropten and UVA irradiation in V79 Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts and found concentration additivity. 5‐MOP was the most potent, followed by 8‐MOP. The relative potency of the angular furocoumarin angelicin and the methoxycoumarin citropten for gene‐mutation and clastogenicity after UVA exposure was 50‐fold and &gt; 100‐fold lower than that of the most potent furocoumarin, 5‐MOP.
