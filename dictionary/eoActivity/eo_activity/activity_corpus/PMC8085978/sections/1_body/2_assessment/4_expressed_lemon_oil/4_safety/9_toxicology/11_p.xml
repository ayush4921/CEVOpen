<p>Because of their structure including a linear condensed aromatic ring system, furocoumarins form noncovalent intercalation complexes with DNA, like anthraquinones and anthracyclines. Upon irradiation with ultraviolet A (UVA), the compounds are activated to form covalent monoadducts with DNA bases (mainly thymidine). Further activation with UVA can lead linear furocoumarins (psoralen, 5‐MOP and 8‐MOP) to form a second covalent linkage to cause DNA‐crosslinks. Angular furocoumarins, such as angelicin, can also form mono‐adducts with DNA but no DNA‐crosslinks, which explains the lower genotoxic potency of these compounds compared to linear furocoumarins. Furocoumarins irradiated with UVA may produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), which induce photo‐oxidative damage to various macromolecules (IARC, 
 <xref rid="efs26548-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). No comparative information is available for methoxycoumarins, however, because of their structural similarity, it can be expected that methoxycoumarins show a similar behaviour as furocoumarins. Psoralen, 8‐MOP and angelicin were shown to be weak frameshift mutagens in

Upon UVA irradiation 5‐MOP and 8‐MOP bind covalently to DNA of bacteria and yeasts and exhibit strong mutagenic effects. Mutagenic effects in bacteria were also observed for other psoralens, such as imperatorin.
