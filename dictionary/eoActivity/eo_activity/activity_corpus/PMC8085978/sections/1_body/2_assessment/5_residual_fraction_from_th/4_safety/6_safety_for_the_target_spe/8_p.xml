<p>Table 
 <xref rid="efs26548-tbl-0013" ref-type="table">13</xref> shows an MOET below the value of 100 for chickens for fattening, piglets, pigs for fattening and sows. In order to ensure an MOET ≥ 100, the concentration in feed should be reduced to 11 mg/kg for chickens for fattening, 20 mg/kg for piglets, 24 mg/kg for pigs for fattening and 29 mg/kg for sows. For the other species, the FEEDAP Panel concludes with respect to the exposure to the volatiles (except perillaldehyde) present in the additive that the use of the residual fraction of expressed lemon oil at the maximum proposed use levels in feed is safe for all animal species, except for cats. Owing to the unusually low capacity for glucuronidation in cats (Court and Greenblatt, 
 <xref rid="efs26548-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">1997</xref>), an MOET of 500 is considered adequate. No specific proposals have been made by the applicant for the use level in water for drinking. Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel considered the same use level in water for drinking as proposed for feed. When used in water for drinking, the intake of the additive via water would be two to three times higher than the intake via feed for poultry, pigs and rabbits (EFSA FEEDAP Panel, 
 <xref rid="efs26548-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). The Panel considers that the use level in water for drinking is safe provided that the total daily intake of the additive does not exceed the daily amount that is considered safe when consumed via feed.
