In both species, the increased mortality observed in the top dose group was associated with indications of neurotoxicity (hyperactivity, tremors, tonic seizures). The 3‐month NTP study was essentially similar to the 2‐week study except the duration. α‐Thujone and isomeric mixture were administered by gavage to B6C3F1 mice and to Fischer 344 rats at doses of 0, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 or 100 mg/kg for 13 weeks. In both species the increased mortality observed in the higher dose groups (from 25 or 50 and greater) was associated with seizures.’
