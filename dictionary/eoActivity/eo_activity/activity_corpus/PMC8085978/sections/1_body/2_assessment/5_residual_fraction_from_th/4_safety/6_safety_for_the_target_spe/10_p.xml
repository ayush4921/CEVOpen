<p>Low concentrations of perillaldehyde were detected in one batch of the additive under assessment (0.092%). The use of the residual fraction of expressed lemon oil at the proposed use level in feed (12–35 mg/kg) would result in an intake of perillaldehyde up to 1.0 μg/kg bw for poultry, 1.4 g μg/kg bw for pigs, 0.6 μg/kg bw for ruminants, 0.7 μg/kg bw for horses, 0.6 μg/kg bw for rabbit and 0.2 μg/kg bw for fish.
