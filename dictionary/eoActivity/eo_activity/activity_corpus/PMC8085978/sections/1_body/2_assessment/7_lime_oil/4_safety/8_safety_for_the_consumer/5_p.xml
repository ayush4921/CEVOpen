<p>No data on residues in products of animal origin were made available for any of the constituents of the essential oil. However, the Panel recognises that the constituents of lime oil are expected to be extensively metabolised and excreted in the target species (see Section 
 <xref rid="efs26548-sec-0015" ref-type="sec">3.2.2.1</xref>). Therefore, a relevant increase of the uptake of the individual constituents by humans consuming products of animal origin is not expected.
