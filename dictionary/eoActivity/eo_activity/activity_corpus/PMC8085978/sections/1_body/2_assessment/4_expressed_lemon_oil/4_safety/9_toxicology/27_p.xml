<p>In the chronic study, ‘an isomeric mixture of thujone
 <sup>23</sup> was administered by gavage to B6C3F1 mice at doses of 0, 3, 6, 12 and 25 mg/kg body weight/day and to Fischer 344 rats at doses of 0, 12.5, 25 and 50 mg/kg body weight/day for 2 years. In both species, increased mortality was observed in the top dose group, and in the rat also in the middle dose group. Clonic and tonic seizures were observed in the middle and top dose groups in rats and in the top dose group in mice. A small increase in clonic seizures was observed also in the low dose group in rats. The administration of α,β‐thujone resulted in increased incidences of non‐neoplastic lesions in the brain

In the rat, the no observed effect level (NOEL) value was 12.5 mg/kg bw for mortality and tonic seizures (no NOEL for clonic seizures). In the mouse, the NOEL was 12 mg/kg bw for seizures and mortality.’
