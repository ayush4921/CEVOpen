<p>Lime oil contains trace amounts of 5‐MOP and methoxycoumarins, mainly citropten and 5‐geranyloxy‐7‐methoxycoumarin. The ADME of 5‐MOP has been addressed in Section 
 <xref rid="efs26548-sec-0015" ref-type="sec">3.2.2.1</xref>. In the absence of specific data on the ADME of methoxyoxycoumarins, it is assumed that the same metabolic pathways described for furocoumarins also apply to citropten and 5‐geranyloxy‐7‐methoxycoumarin (see Section 
 <xref rid="efs26548-sec-0015" ref-type="sec">3.2.2.1</xref>).
