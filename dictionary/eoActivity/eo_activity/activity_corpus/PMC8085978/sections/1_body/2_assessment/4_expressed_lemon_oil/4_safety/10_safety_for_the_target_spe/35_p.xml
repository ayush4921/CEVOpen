<p>The FEEDAP Panel concludes that expressed lemon oil is safe up to the maximum proposed use level in complete feed of 40 mg/kg for turkeys for fattening, 90 mg/kg for veal calves, cattle for fattening and dairy cows, 30 mg/kg for sheep, goats and rabbits and 40 mg/kg for salmonids. For the other species, the calculated safe concentrations are 35 mg/kg for chickens for fattening, 52 mg/kg for laying hens, 62 mg/kg for piglets, 74 mg/kg for pigs for fattening, 92 mg/kg for sows and 137 mg/kg for horses. These target species are fed citrus by‐products as part of daily feed. For these species, the use of the expressed lemon oil in feed is not expected to increase the exposure to furocoumarins and methoxycoumarins and perillaldehyde to a relevant extent (&lt; 10%). For companion animals and ornamental fish not normally exposed to citrus by‐products, no conclusion can be drawn.</p>
