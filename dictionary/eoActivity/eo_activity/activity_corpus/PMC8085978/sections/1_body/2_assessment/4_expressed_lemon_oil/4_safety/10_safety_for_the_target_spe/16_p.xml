<p>As the result of the hazard characterisation, a reference point was identified for each component in the assessment group based on the toxicity data available (NOAEL from 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> toxicity study or read across) or from the 5th percentile of the distribution of NOAELs of the corresponding Cramer Class (i.e. 3, 0.91 and 0.15 mg/kg bw per day, respectively, for Cramer Class I, II and III compounds). Reference points selected for each compound are shown in Table
