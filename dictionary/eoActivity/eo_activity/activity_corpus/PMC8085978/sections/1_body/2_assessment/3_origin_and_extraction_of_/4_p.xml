<p>Extraction by mechanical pressing is the most commonly used method to obtain essential oils from the peel of citrus fruits, and since it does not require heat, it is often referred to as ‘expression’ or ‘cold pressing.’ In the mechanised process, the surface of the lemon peel is first scarified to encourage cells containing the essential oil to break open and release their contents. Water is then sprayed over the fruit to collect the released oil and the aqueous suspension filtered to remove cell debris. Centrifugation is then used to separate the oil/water mix and to remove any fine particles. In addition to the direct use of cold‐pressed lemon oil, the applicant also uses distillation of the expressed oil to obtain two further preparations – a volatile fraction collected after condensation and a residual fraction.
