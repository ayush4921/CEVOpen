<p>The non‐volatile residue (residue on evaporation) of expressed lemon oil accounts for 1.8–3.6% of the oil according to the European Pharmacopoeia (PhEur, 
 <xref rid="efs26548-bib-0061" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). The applicant performed a literature search to document the relative percentage and the composition of the non‐volatile fraction in lemon oil.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="efs26548-note-1022">20</xref> The non‐volatile fraction contains furocoumarins and methoxycoumarins, which together account for 0.5–0.8% of the oil (Comments on the PhEur, 
 <xref rid="efs26548-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). Besides furocoumarins and coumarins, the presence of hydrocarbons, sterols, waxes, carotenoids and flavonoids has been reported (Mehl et al.,

However, in the quantitative study by Russo et al. (
