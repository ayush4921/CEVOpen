<p>Several single generation reproduction studies have been reported in rats and rabbits for 5‐MOP and 8‐MOP in the presence of UVA light, using doses ranging from 20 to 560 mg/kg bw per day. In all of the studies, there was an adverse effect on the parent generation, sometimes resulting in reduced litter size and weight. Effects on offspring were limited to reduction in body weight; one study claiming malformations in offspring was rejected by IARC as being inadequate.</p>
