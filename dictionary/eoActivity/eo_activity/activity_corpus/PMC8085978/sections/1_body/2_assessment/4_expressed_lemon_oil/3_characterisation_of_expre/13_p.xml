<p>Data on chemical and microbial impurities were provided in five batches of lemon oil expressed of different origin (three of Mediterranean origin).
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="efs26548-note-1025">23</xref> The concentrations of heavy metals were below the corresponding limit of quantification (LOQ) in five batches. In the same batches, mycotoxins (aflatoxins B1, B2, G1 and G2) were below the LOQ and pesticides were not detected in a multiresidue analysis with the exception of chlorpyrifos ethyl (0.14–0.9 mg/kg), chlorpyrifos methyl (0.11 and 0.43 mg/kg, detected in two batches), 2‐phenylphenol (0.74–4.6 mg/kg detected in three batches) and imazalil (0.33 mg/kg, detected in one batch). In three batches of different origin (two of Mediterranean origin), polychlorinated dibenzo‐
 <italic>p</italic>‐dioxin (PCDD), polychlorinated dibenzofuran (PCDF) and dioxin‐like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were below the corresponding LOQ and the calculated upper bond for the sum of the World Health Organization (WHO) PCCD/F + PCB (Toxic Equivalent) TEQ ranged between 0.83 and 0.92 pg/g wet weight. None of the data on chemical impurities raised concerns.
