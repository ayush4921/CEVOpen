<p>In 2004, the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) Senate Commission on Food Safety (SKLM) issued a toxicological assessment of furocoumarins in foodstuffs (translated in English in 2006) (SKLM,

 <xref rid="efs26548-bib-0070" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). The SKLM concluded for food that may contain furocoumarins, a final assessment of the carcinogenic risk was not possible due to the complexity of the influencing factors, such as levels of exposure, the underlying metabolism and the influence of light. An additional risk of skin cancer arising from the intake of typical quantities of flavoured and non‐flavoured furocoumarin‐containing foods, which leads to an exposure well below the phototoxic dose‐range, was regarded as negligible. For phototoxic effects, the SKLM (
 <xref rid="efs26548-bib-0070" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>) did not see a significant risk associated with the consumption of typical quantities of correctly stored, processed foods that may contain furocoumarins.
