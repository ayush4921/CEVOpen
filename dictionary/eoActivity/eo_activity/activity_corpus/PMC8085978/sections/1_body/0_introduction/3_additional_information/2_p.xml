<p>The three preparations under assessment, namely expressed lemon oil and distilled lemon oil from 
 <italic>C. limon</italic> (L.) Burm. f., and lime oil from 
 <italic>C. aurantiifolia</italic> (Christm.) Swingle, are currently authorised as feed additives according to the entry in the European Union Register of Feed Additives pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 (2b natural products – botanically defined). They have not been assessed as feed additives in the EU. The FEEDAP Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) notes that two different additives fall into the definition ‘lemon oil distilled’ obtained by distillation of expressed lemon oil, a residual fraction and a volatile fraction.
