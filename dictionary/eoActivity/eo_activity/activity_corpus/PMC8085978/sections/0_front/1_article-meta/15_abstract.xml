 <p>Following a request from the European Commission, the 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">EFSA</styled-content> Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">FEEDAP</styled-content>) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety and efficacy of expressed lemon oil and distilled lemon oil from 
  <italic>Citrus limon</italic> (L.) Osbeck and lime oil from 
  <italic>Citrus aurantiifolia</italic> (Christm.) Swingle, when used as sensory additives in feed for all animal species. The use of the expressed lemon oil and its residual fraction and the use of lime oil in feed is not expected to increase the exposure to furocoumarins and methoxycoumarins and perillaldehyde of those target species that are already fed citrus by‐products a relevant extent (&lt; 10%). For companion animals and ornamental fish not normally exposed to citrus by‐products, no conclusion can be drawn. For the other species and for the distilled fraction of expressed lemon oil, the 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">FEEDAP</styled-content> Panel concludes that the additives under assessment are safe at the maximum proposed or at reduced use levels in complete feed. The Panel considers that the use in water for drinking is safe provided that the total daily intake of the additive does not exceed the daily amount that is considered safe when consumed via feed. No concerns for consumer safety were identified following the use of the additives at the maximum proposed use level in feed. The additives under assessment should be considered as irritants to skin and eyes and the respiratory tract and as skin sensitisers. Since expressed lemon oil and its fractions contain furocoumarins, they may cause phototoxicity. The use of the additives under the proposed conditions of use in animal feed is not expected to pose a risk for the environment. Since 
  <italic>C. limon and C. aurantiifolia</italic> and their preparations are recognised to flavour food and its function in feed would be essentially the same as that in food, no further demonstration of efficacy is considered necessary.
