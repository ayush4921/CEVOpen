<p>Structural similarities of the LACs seem to cause antagonistic-like interaction between compounds, resulting in a decrease or loss of sedative effect. This means the overall sedative activity of agarwood arises from the collective effect of the different classes of constituents (i.e., LACs, sesquiterpenes) it contains. A future study exploring a broad range of doses and compound combinations is recommended to firmly establish interaction between constituents.</p>
