<p>The characteristic aroma of agarwood is made up of numerous complex constituents. Among them are LACs which had been previously identified as consistent pyrolysis products of non-volatile chromones. In the present study, these LACs were proven to have inhalational sedative effects, demonstrating their importance in the aroma as well as substantiating the use of agarwood as a sedative in traditional medicines. Similarly, this suggests the potential of LACs as independent sedating agents. The compounds may be investigated further using other animal models for better insight on the sedative effects.</p>
