<p>The sedative activity of each LACs and DEGEE were investigated through behavioral observation method, specifically the open field test (OFT). The simplicity of OFT and the straightforward interpretation of results makes it a suitable method in screening compounds for pharmacologic activity [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-26-01320" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Reduced locomotion and prolonged immobility of mice in an hour-long OFT can be construed as sedation or sleep [

 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-01320" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], which was also the indicator used by previous studies to evaluate sedative activity in mice [

With doses ranging from 0.0001 g/L to 1 g/L, a volume of 400 μL of pure compounds were individually administered to mice by vapor inhalation. These doses were determined based on the effective concentration range in earlier studies that employed the same experimental model [

 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-01320" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Since the compounds under investigation have simple and related structures, one set of control group was considered appropriate for evaluation. Additionally, benzylacetone—an important volatile constituent in agarwood oil and smoke [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-26-01320" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-26-01320" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]—served a dual purpose of being a test compound and positive control. Benzylacetone had been established to possess an inhalational sedative effect through olfactory stimulation [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-26-01320" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-26-01320" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-01320" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and was used as a positive control in numerous animal studies [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-26-01320" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-01320" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,

 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-01320" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The structure of benzylacetone is also closely related to the other compounds in the study; thus, evaluation of their sedative activity was more reliable. Coincidentally, benzylacetone is also abundantly emitted by some flowering plants like 
 <italic>Nicotiana attenuata</italic> where it acts as the most attractant component [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-01320" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Other plants found to have benzylacetone as a major component includes 
 <italic>Rhododendron anthopogonoides</italic> and 
 <italic>Lavandula angustifolia</italic> which are both used in traditional medicines to treat lung problems and to induce sleep, respectively [

 <xref rid="B30-molecules-26-01320" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. At a dose of 0.0001 g/L, benzylacetone exhibited a strong sedative activity (58% reduction against control) confirming the validity of the experimental model. A similar dose-response pattern (i.e., U-shaped) shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-01320-f002">Figure 2</xref> was also demonstrated from previous studies [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-26-01320" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-26-01320" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-01320" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], although there were differences in the observed most effective dose maybe because of interpersonal variation. Hence, an additional 0.00001 g/L dose was performed to verify the results in the present study.
