<p>Compounds investigated in the study exhibit inhalational sedative effects individually. Given that they exist together to create the characteristic aroma of agarwood, it is important to see their combined effects or interaction from the pharmacologic perspective. There are several possible combinations of compounds in varying dose levels that can be tested. In order to simulate agarwood to some extent, mixtures of the compounds were made according to their presence in K1 and K2 aroma. The dose of each compound in the mixture was based on their respective most effective dose determined from individual administration. Mixture 1, representing LACs in K1 aroma, was composed of 1/7-part benzylacetone at 0.0001 g/L; 1/7-part compound 
 <bold>1</bold> (benzaldehyde) at 0.001 g/L; 1/7-part compound 
 <bold>2</bold> (DEGEE) at 0.01 g/L; 1/7-part compound 
 <bold>3</bold> (
 <italic>p</italic>-vinylanisole) at 0.01 g/L; 1/7-part compound 
 <bold>4</bold> (
 <italic>p</italic>-anisaldehyde) at 0.0001 g/L; 1/7-part compound 
 <bold>5</bold> (acetanisole) at 0.001 g/L; and 1/7-part compound 
 <bold>6</bold> (anisylacetone) at 0.1 g/L. On the other hand, Mixture 2, representing LACs in K2 aroma, was composed of 1/4-part benzylacetone at 0.0001 g/L; 1/4-part compound 
 <bold>1</bold> (benzaldehyde) at 0.001 g/L; 1/4-part compound 
 <bold>2</bold> (DEGEE) at 0.01 g/L; and 1/4-part compound 
 <bold>4</bold> (
 <italic>p</italic>-anisaldehyde) at 0.0001 g/L. Since compound 
 <bold>2</bold> is structurally different and had not been identified from agarwood analyses before, separate mixtures were also created without it (i.e., Mixture 1 without Compound 
 <bold>2</bold> and Mixture 2 without Compound 
 <bold>2</bold>). Initially, four different mixtures were made. Each mixture (400 Î¼L) was administered to mice and the sedative effects were evaluated using the same experimental model employed during individual administration. Results are shown in
