<p>Compound 
 <bold>2</bold> is a known solubilizer that can enhance skin and mucosal permeation of active ingredients in cosmetics and drug formulations [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-26-01320" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, its inertness as an excipient is an ongoing debate because it was reported to cause neurolepsis in mice (minimum symptomatic dose = 50 g/kg, intraperitoneal) and various CNS effects in rats (continuous inhalation at 0.27 and 4.5 ppm for 4 months) [

 <xref rid="B34-molecules-26-01320" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Results in this study further confirm that inhalation exposure of compound 
 <bold>2</bold> at 0.01 g/L for an hour can cause sedation in mice.
