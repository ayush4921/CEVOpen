<p>Interestingly, mice treated with Mixture 1 showed an increase in spontaneous motor activity by 20% compared to the control group. Excitation behaviors were also observed such as jumping, unsupported rearing, and seemingly attempting to climb walls. Moreover, it is evident from the locomotor transition activity chart (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-01320-f004">Figure 4</xref>b) the mice kept moving during the entire OFT. This suggests possible antagonism between the seven compounds. The reason may be due to the large number of different molecules (i.e., seven different compounds) present in the mixture which crowded and overwhelmed the receptors; thus, stimulated movements of mice. In contrast, mice treated with Mixture 2 exhibited 54% reduction in spontaneous motor activity against control, indicating the combination of benzylacetone, compounds 
 <bold>1</bold>, 
 <bold>2</bold>, and 
 <bold>4</bold> has significant sedative activity. This is probably because of the smaller number of different molecules (i.e., only four compounds) present in the mixture. Although the sedative activity of Mixture 2 and single administration of benzylacetone (0.0001 g/L) were not significantly different, it appears the latter is more effective in inducing sedation in mice. Hence, further supporting the influence of the number of diversified molecules in the sedative activity.
