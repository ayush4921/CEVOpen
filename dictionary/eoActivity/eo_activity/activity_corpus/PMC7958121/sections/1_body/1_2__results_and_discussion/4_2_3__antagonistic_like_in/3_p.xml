<p>The absence of compound 
 <bold>2</bold> in Mixture 1 decreased spontaneous motor activity by 13%, but hardly enough to generate a significant effect. Removing compound 
 <bold>2</bold>, which has a mucosal permeation enhancing functionality [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-26-01320" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], likely decreased contact time of the LACs in the mucus layer of mice. Accordingly, this relieved overcrowding of the large number of molecules rushing to the receptor; and a decrease in spontaneous motor activity was observed when compound 
 <bold>2</bold> was removed from the mixture. On the other hand, a 47% reduction in spontaneous motor activity was observed when compound 
 <bold>2</bold> was removed from Mixture 2, which was slightly less effective than having it in the mixture. This result might appear contradicting with the preceding argument but to reiterate, a relatively small number of molecules was present in Mixture 2. Therefore, further removal of compound 
 <bold>2</bold> probably means decreased contact time of the LACs in the mucus layer and less chances for the few molecules present in interacting with the receptors. In addition, aldehydes (i.e., compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>4</bold>) which made up most of Mixture 2 are prone to fast enzymatic conversion in mouse mucus [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-26-01320" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Thus, it is possible the lack of permeation enhancement brought by compound 
 <bold>2</bold> placed the LACs in Mixture 2 at a disadvantage, resulting in less effective sedation in mice. Additional experiments on compound 
 <bold>2</bold> with other combinations of compounds or even with a single compound may aid in better demonstration of its effects.
