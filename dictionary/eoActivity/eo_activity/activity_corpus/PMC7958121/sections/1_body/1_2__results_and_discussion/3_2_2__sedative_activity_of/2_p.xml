<p>Inhalational administration results of the rest of the compounds are likewise presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-01320-f002">Figure 2</xref>. All of them reduced total spontaneous motor activity at almost all tested doses in a dose-dependent manner. This is a good indication that despite their low molecular weights, the compound molecules were successfully contained inside the make-shift open field arena; and thus, effectively administered to mice. The U-shape partly drawn by the area under the curve (AUC) graphs representing total spontaneous motor activity suggests a biphasic effect of the compounds; that is, sedative at lower doses and stimulatory at higher doses. This is a characteristic of drugs acting on the central nervous system (CNS) [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-26-01320" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and a description of CNS depressant effects brought by volatile aromatic hydrocarbons used as solvents, like the compounds investigated in this study [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-26-01320" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The U-shaped pattern might not be too obvious because of the narrow therapeutic window and limited explored dose range. Moreover, a W-shaped pattern is apparent when analyzing the entire AUC graph of each compound (i.e., from 0.0001 g/L to 1 g/L), specifically compound 
 <bold>2</bold>â€“
 <bold>6</bold>. It might be related to the presence of an additional substituent to the ring, particularly the alkoxy group which also happens to be in compound 
 <bold>2</bold>. Nevertheless, reduced spontaneous motor activity at higher doses was dismissed as false sedative activity since excitation behaviors (e.g., jumping, excessive rearing) were seen in mice. This was true for all compounds. After the initial 20 min, the mice suddenly became indolent, yet generally remained awake and continuously moved until the end of experiments (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-01320">Figure S2</xref>). Therefore, the effective dose of most compounds in this study appears narrow and more confined at the lower end of the explored range. The obtained results agree with the previous findings that individual administration of low doses of pure agarwood compounds is highly potent in terms of sedative activity [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-26-01320" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Strongest sedative effect was observed at a dose of 0.001 g/L for compound 
 <bold>1</bold> (benzaldehyde); 0.01 g/L for compound 
 <bold>2</bold> (DEGEE); 0.01 g/L for compound 
 <bold>3</bold> (
 <italic>p</italic>-vinylanisole); 0.0001 g/L for compound 
 <bold>4</bold> (
 <italic>p</italic>-anisaldehyde); 0.001 g/L for compound 
 <bold>5</bold> (acetanisole); and 0.1 g/L for compound 
 <bold>6</bold> (anisylacetone) as evidenced by more than half reduction (64%, 67%, 63%, 66%, 61%, and 58%, respectively) in total spontaneous motor activity compared to control. Looking at the locomotor transition activity in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-01320-f003">Figure 3</xref>, a sharp decline in movements that almost approached zero in the first 30 min is observed in all compounds. This appears contradictory to the exploratory nature of mice. The less time spent in ambulation may be interpreted as easily reaching the comfortable state of sleepiness; and hence, forgoing the need to investigate the novel environment. Mice under the influence of LACs also exhibited low spontaneous motor activity at the outset of OFT; thus, suggesting an instantaneous and potent effect of these compounds.
