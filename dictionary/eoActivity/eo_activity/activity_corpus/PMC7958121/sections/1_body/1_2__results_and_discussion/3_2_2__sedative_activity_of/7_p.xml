<p>Compound 
 <bold>5</bold> is a structural analogue of acetophenone, which had been previously determined to be highly active in terms of inducing sedation in mice [

 <bold>5</bold>. Aside from agarwood, compound 
 <bold>5</bold> is also a main volatile constituent of Propolis essential oil (collected from Albania), which is slowly becoming popular for its promising biological activities [
