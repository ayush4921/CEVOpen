<p>The sedative activity of agarwood oil administered via inhalation and intraperitoneal injection had been successfully demonstrated from previous pharmacological studies [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-26-01320" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-26-01320" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In both cases, majority of the oil composition were sesquiterpenes. Takemoto et al. specifically identified α-gurjunene and (+)-calarene as the main volatile constituent in the agarwood oil and confirmed the inhalational sedative effect of individual administration of pure compounds [

A lower dose of the individual sesquiterpenes as compared to their actual content in the oil was also found to be more effective in exerting the sedative effect. Clearly, sesquiterpenes present in agarwood oil has sedative effects. In the same study, the effect of pure (+)-calarene was compared to that of (+)-calarene-containing crude extract of spikenard. It was revealed the crude extract has a wider range of effective doses, implying the many compounds present in the extract caused a collective sedative effect through a combination of various biological activities [

Relating it to the present study, the LACs have sedative effects, and along with other constituents (e.g., sesquiterpenes)—which are probably acting on different receptors, through different mechanisms or signaling response—they give rise to the overall sedative activity of agarwood.
