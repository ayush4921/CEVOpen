<p>Furthermore, aromatic compounds (or odorants, in general) are known to be capable of binding with several olfactory receptors; and conversely, olfactory receptors can accommodate several aromatic compounds. Still, activation of the receptor is not only dependent on the binding affinity of the aromatic compound with the receptor, but also on the intrinsic activity of the aromatic compound or the ability to activate the receptor [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-01320" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Taking Mixture 1 as an example, the higher dose of compound 
 <bold>6</bold> (0.1 g/L) relative with other compounds present suggests it had the largest number of molecules in the mixture, which implies higher chances of binding with the receptor. However, this also means compound 
 <bold>6</bold> is weakly activating since it required that much dose to elicit a sedative effect or a 58% reduction in spontaneous motor activity. Compound 
 <bold>6</bold> possibly occupied but only partially activated the receptors, leaving the strongly activating molecules of other compounds incapable of binding with the receptors. As a result, no significant effects or only comparable sedative activity with a single administration of benzylacetone were observed using the mixtures. Therefore, similarities in the structure of compounds and the number of molecules in a mixture may justify the demonstrated antagonistic-like interaction between LACs and the resulting decrease or loss of sedative activity.
