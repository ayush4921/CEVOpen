<p>The exact nature of the observed interaction is difficult to ascertain and it is presumptuous to outright claim antagonism between test compounds. Nonetheless, it is possible the many different compound molecules were competing for the same target receptor. Resemblances between compounds investigated in the study are quite evident in

The presence of more LACs (i.e., Mixture 1) likely created a tougher competition between structurally alike compounds, while the presence of fewer LACs (i.e., Mixture 2) means less competition; thus, a more effective sedative effect was seen in the latter. Target competition between structurally related compounds was also the assumption drawn by Suberu et al. when anti-malarial active artemisinin was combined with its analogues 9-epi-artemisinin and artemisitine having anti-plasmodial activity of their own but still ended up antagonizing artemisinin’s activity [
