<p>True to their name, the compounds under investigation in the study apart from compound 
 <bold>2</bold> are well-known for their strong aroma. As such, it is obvious they are capable of stimulating olfaction by binding to olfactory receptors. The interaction initiates a signaling response that will eventually reach cortical and subcortical regions of the brain for higher processing [

 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-01320" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-26-01320" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-01320" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Results obtained in the present study implies the outcome of that processing induced sedation in mice. It had been suggested before that the alternating Ï€-bonds in a six-membered ring structure is necessary for the sedative effect [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-01320" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The planar orientation and hydrophobic nature of the aromatic ring clearly enabled the LACs to interact easily to the flat, hydrophobic pocket of the olfactory receptor [

 <xref rid="B41-molecules-26-01320" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Moreover, the carbonyl group on the substituents probably provided additional linkage with the receptor through hydrogen bonding [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-26-01320" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]; thus, resulting in a strong interaction. Correspondingly, the hydroxyl group of compound 
 <bold>2</bold> seemed to allow interaction with the receptor in a similar manner (i.e., hydrogen bonding) [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-26-01320" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]; thus, a sedative effect was seen despite the absence of aromatic ring. Future study using more structural analogues of the compounds is recommended to firmly establish structure-activity relationship.
