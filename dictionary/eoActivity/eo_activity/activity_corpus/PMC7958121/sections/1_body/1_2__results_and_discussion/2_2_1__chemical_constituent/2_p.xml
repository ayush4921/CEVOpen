<p>For clarity, LAC is defined in this study as a simple aromatic compound following rules of aromaticity. Having said that, six compounds out of the 27 identified in the aroma of K1 were classified as LAC; whereas only three LACs were present in the aroma of K2, namely: benzylacetone, benzaldehyde—
 <bold>1</bold>, and 
 <italic>p</italic>-anisaldehyde—
 <bold>4</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-01320-f001">Figure 1</xref>). In addition to those three, the other LACs present in K1 were 
 <italic>p</italic>-vinylanisole—
 <bold>3</bold>, acetanisole—
 <bold>5</bold>, and anisylacetone—
 <bold>6</bold>. All of them had been previously identified from analytical studies on either agarwood oil or smoke [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-26-01320" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, compound 
 <bold>5</bold> was dismissed as an artifact by Hashimoto’s team when they analyzed agarwood that undergone neutralization treatment [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-26-01320" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The structurally related acetophenone appeared more frequently [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-26-01320" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-26-01320" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Regardless, compound 
 <bold>5</bold> was the exact compound identified in the present analysis; thus, it was the one tested in pharmacologic experiments. In addition to the abovementioned LACs, another compound was also included in the evaluation of sedative effects: diethylene glycol monoethyl ether (DEGEE)—
 <bold>2</bold>. It is evident DEGEE does not satisfy requirements for aromaticity, but the compound was deemed structurally simple enough and it also has a subtle, ethereal odor. Moreover, it was detected in both K1 and K2 aroma; although to the best of our knowledge, it had not been identified in previous agarwood analyses.
