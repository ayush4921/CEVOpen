<p>HS-SPME works by virtue of multiphase equilibration system between the sample matrix, the gas phase surrounding the sample (i.e., headspace), and the fiber coating that extracts the analytes. Thus, solid samples like agarwood can be extracted without the need for any solvent or treatment. Moreover, the technique usually employs heating to facilitate mass transfer between phases [

 <xref rid="B12-molecules-26-01320" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], which is more than favorable in the present study. Aside from the fact that the usually encountered form of agarwood is smoke, application of heat was also necessary because the target compounds (i.e., the LACs) are presumed to be pyrolysis products of other constituents, particularly of the lignin and non-volatile chromones [

 <xref rid="B14-molecules-26-01320" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Indeed, the major chromone derivative agarotetrol was confirmed to break down into LACs, namely benzylacetone and benzaldehyde, upon heating [

 <xref rid="B11-molecules-26-01320" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, samples in this study were heated at about 120 °C for 30 min before SPME. Subsequent analysis with GC-MS allowed separation of the extracted analytes as well as characterization of individual constituents. Results revealed chromatographic profiles of the two agarwood samples were different (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-01320">Table S1</xref>) representing 98.13% of the total volatiles, with more than half of the composition being spathulenol (51.78%). Meanwhile, a total of 35 compounds were detected in the aroma of K2 (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-01320">Table S1</xref>) representing 99.28% of the total volatiles. Major components were δ- and α-guaiene (18.87% and 16.05%, respectively), along with capsidiol (14.73%). Nonetheless, the aroma of the two samples had 16 compounds in common and both were predominantly made up of sesquiterpenes. These profiles complemented previous analyses on high-quality agarwood smoke, which was characterized by the presence of more complex constituents (i.e., sesquiterpenes) and less aromatic compounds or pyrolysis products [
