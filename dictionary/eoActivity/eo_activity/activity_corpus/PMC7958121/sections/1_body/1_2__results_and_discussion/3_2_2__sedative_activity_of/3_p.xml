<p>Inhalation of compound 
 <bold>1</bold>, a major constituent of 
 <italic>Tilia</italic> (lime blossoms) essential oil used in folk medicine and aromatherapy for sedation, had already been reported to cause a decrease in spontaneous motor activity of mice [

 <bold>1</bold> in this study), as well as anisylacetone (compound 
 <bold>6</bold> in this study) which is an analogue of benzylacetone, have potent sedative activity through the same route of administration [
