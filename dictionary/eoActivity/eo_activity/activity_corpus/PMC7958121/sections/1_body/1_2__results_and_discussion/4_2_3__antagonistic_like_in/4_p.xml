<p>To further confirm the interaction between compounds, Mixture 1 and 2 were each diluted to 1/10 of the original dose mixture. Results are incorporated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-01320-f004">Figure 4</xref>. Diluted Mixture 1 significantly reduced spontaneous motor activity of mice, which is almost half of the original mixture. This shows a lower dose of Mixture 1 caused a significant sedative effect in mice, supporting the results obtained using the original mixtures; that is, fewer molecules have less tendency to overcrowd receptors and oppose each otherâ€™s sedative activity. Likewise, loss of sedative activity of Diluted Mixture 2 corroborates the assumption made on the influence of the number of molecules present in the mixture, as well as the less effective sedative effect observed when compound 
 <bold>2</bold> was removed from the original mixture. There were already a small number of molecules in Mixture 2, enough to generate a sedative effect; thus, a further decrease in molecule count (e.g., through dilution or removal of compound 
 <bold>2</bold>) results in less opportunity for interaction with receptors and loss of sedative activity.
