<p>Compound 
 <bold>4</bold>, an analogue of compound 
 <bold>1</bold>, is a naturally occurring flavoring agent commonly found in spices such as 
 <italic>Pimpinella anisum</italic> and 
 <italic>Foeniculum vulgare</italic> [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-26-01320" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. It is interesting to note the two seemingly equal significant sedative effects (at 0.0001 g/L and 0.1 g/L) displayed in AUC graph of compound 
 <bold>4</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-01320-f002">Figure 2</xref>). A similar motor activity pattern was demonstrated when thymol was evaluated for inhalational effect in mice; and through rotarod test, the decrease in spontaneous motor activity at higher dose was considered due to muscle relaxation instead of sedation [

 <xref rid="B37-molecules-26-01320" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Hence, it is possible at 0.1 g/L dose, compound 
 <bold>4</bold> exerts a direct effect on peripheral muscles through those receptors. Intraperitoneal administration of compound 
 <bold>4</bold> was found to prolong pentobarbital-induced sleeping time in mice [
