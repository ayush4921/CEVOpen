<p>In this study, low molecular weight aromatic compounds (LACs) identified in the aroma of two high-quality agarwood (
 <italic>Kyara</italic> grade)—sampled by means of headspace-solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and analyzed through gas chromatography-tandem with mass spectrometry (GC-MS)—were individually evaluated for inhalational sedative activity in mice through open field test (OFT). Furthermore, mixtures of LACs (representing the components in each agarwood sample) using their most effective dose determined from the individual administration were evaluated to confirm sedative activity and to elucidate the interaction between compounds.
