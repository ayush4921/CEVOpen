<p>Four-week-old male ddY mice (weighing 18–20 g) were purchased from Japan SLC, Inc (Shizuoka, Japan). Upon arrival, the animals were housed in colony cages (33.8 cm wide, 22.5 cm long, 14 cm high; 6 mice per cage) lain with approximately 1 cm-thick chip wood bedding. Cages were kept in the animal housing facility at a temperature of 23 ± 2 °C and relative humidity of 50 ± 10%, under a 12 h light-dark cycle with the light phase beginning at 8:00. All mice had free access to tap water and standard pellet chow. They were allowed to acclimatize for a week prior to use in experiments.</p>
