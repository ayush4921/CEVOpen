<p>After each experiment, the arena was wiped with 70% ethanol and soft micro wiper, then left to dry for about 5 min to remove any olfactory cues from the previous mouse before proceeding to the next trial. Control (TEC) and treatment groups were randomly and simultaneously performed throughout the study to account for variation; and at the same time, to reduce the number of mice. The results were reproducible; thus, using six mice for each administration group were found to be sufficient.</p>
