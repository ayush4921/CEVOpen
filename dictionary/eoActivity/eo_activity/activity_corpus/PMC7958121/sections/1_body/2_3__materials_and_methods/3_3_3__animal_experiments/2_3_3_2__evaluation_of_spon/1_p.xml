<p>The experiment was carried out as described in previous studies [

The open field arena (60 cm wide, 30 cm long, 34 cm high) was made of clear acrylic, with floors (divided into 10 cm× 10 cm squares) and walls in white background. Two filter paper discs (90 mm diameter) were cut in half and attached using adhesive tape to each top corner of the arena. Then, each piece was loaded with 100 μL of the prepared dose of either benzylacetone (positive control), test compound or mixture (400 μL in total for every administration). The arena was immediately covered allowing the fragrant molecules to permeate inside by natural diffusion. After exactly 1 h, a mouse was placed in the center; and ambulation was recorded by a video camera suspended above the arena for another hour. Spontaneous motor activity was evaluated by counting the number of squares crossed with the four paws every 5 min. AUC, representing total locomotor activity, was calculated using the trapezoidal rule. The same procedure was followed for the control group, replacing the test compound with a similar volume of TEC only.
