<p>Qualitative analysis of the volatile components was performed using GC-MS (GC-2030/GCMS-QP2020 NX; Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) under the following operating conditions: column was DB-WAX (60 m × 0.25 mm, film thickness: 0.25 μm; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA); column oven program was 60 °C initially held for 2 min, increased by 4 °C/min to 120 °C and maintained for 10 min, then increased by 3 °C/min until 210 °C, further increased by 5 °C/min to 230 °C, and maintained for 9 min. Injection temperature was 160 °C; carrier gas was helium set at 1 mL/min; and MS interface temperature was 240 °C. Peaks were identified based on retention times and mass fragmentation patterns available on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) database. Linear retention index values of volatile components were obtained by running a mixture of 
 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes (C
 <sub>10</sub>–C
 <sub>22</sub>) as standard under the same condition. Relative amount of the compounds was estimated using peak area normalization method since using an internal or external standard is not feasible given the solid state of the samples.
