<p>Aroma of agarwood samples were extracted using HS-SPME and analyzed through GC-MS. One milligram of agarwood chip sample, shredded by hand, was placed in an SPME vial (Supelco, Inc., Bellefonte, PA, USA). The vial was heated on a hot plate for 30 min. The temperature of the bottom surface of the vial was continuously measured using a digital thermometer and strictly monitored by adjusting the controls of the hot plate. The actual heating temperature ranged from 126 °C to 148 °C. After heating, the SPME fiber (polydimethylsiloxane, 100 μm; Supelco, Inc., Bellefonte, PA, USA) was inserted into the headspace at room temperature for 10 min to adsorb the volatile components.</p>
