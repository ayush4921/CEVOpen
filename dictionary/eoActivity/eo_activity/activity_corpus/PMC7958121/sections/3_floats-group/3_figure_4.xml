  <p>Total spontaneous motor activity (
   <bold>a</bold>), locomotor transition activity of mice treated with mixtures relating to K1 (
   <bold>b</bold>), and locomotor transition activity of mice treated with mixtures relating to K2 (
   <bold>c</bold>). Mixture 1, representing aroma constituents present in K1, contained all seven compounds; whereas Mixture 2, representing aroma constituents present in K2, only included benzylacetone, compounds 
   <bold>1</bold>, 
   <bold>2</bold>, and 
   <bold>4</bold>. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM (
   <italic>n</italic> = 6). Statistical differences vs. control group and benzylacetone (0.0001 g/L) were calculated using One-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s test. (significant against control: * 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, ** 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01; significant against benzylacetone: # 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, ### 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).
