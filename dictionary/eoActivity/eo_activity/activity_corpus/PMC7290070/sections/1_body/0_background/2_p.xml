<p id="Par51">Plants’ essential oil content and composition, and in-turn, its biological activity, has proved to be related to several factors including altitude, genetic, climate, topography, genotype, growing conditions and harvest time. Also, different chemotypes have been described for a number of medicinal plants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Moreover, studies have shown that the different characteristics of medicinal plant may be affected by a variety of ecological factors such soil composition, temperature, humidity and other climatic conditions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Consequently, these changes in content and composition would definitely affect the pharmacological activity of the essential oil. Specifically, several studies show that chemical metabolic profile of Lamiaceae plants is strongly affected by environmental conditions such as geographical cultivation area, cultivation and harvesting period as well as local ecological conditions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. For example, altitude is one of the factors that affect plant metabolism [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Previous reports revealed that phenol-rich Lamiaceae species have shown that the great diversity in the content of thymol and carvacrol in the essential oils is associated with climatic factors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Altitude affected the quantity and quality of the essential oil of several studied plants like 
 <italic>Thymus kotschyanus</italic> (Lamiaceae), 
 <italic>Teucrium hyrcanicum</italic> (Lamiaceae), 
 <italic>Cymbopogon olivieri</italic> (Poaceae), 
 <italic>Mentha piperita</italic> (Lamiaceae), 
 <italic>Tanacetum polycephalum</italic> (Asteraceae), 
 <italic>Ziziphora clinopodioides</italic> (Lamiaceae) and 
 <italic>Lavandula angustifolia</italic> (Lamiaceae) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. To further investigate the effect of altitude on the Libyan-growing medicinal plant; 
 <italic>Satureja thymbra</italic>, the present work aimed at studying the impact of two different altitudes (Wasita and Safsaf in Al Jabal Al Akhdar region in Libya), on the chemical profile, antimicrobial, anthelmintic and cytotoxic activity of the essential oils of 
 <italic>S. thymbra</italic> aerial parts collected during fall 2017 and 2018.
