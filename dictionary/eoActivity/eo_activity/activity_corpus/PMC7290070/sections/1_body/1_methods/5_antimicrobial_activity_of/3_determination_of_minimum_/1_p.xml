<p id="Par58">Broth dilution method was used for determination of minimum inhibitory and minimum lethal concentrations of the oil (MIC/MLC) against the previously mentioned standard microorganisms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Determination was achieved on 96 well culture plates using a microorganism suspension at a density of 10
 <sup>5</sup> CFU/ml with Casein Soy Broth (CSB) incubated for 24 h at 37 °C for bacteria, and Sabouraud Dextrose Broth (SDB) incubated for 48 h at 25 °C for yeasts. Serial dilutions of essential oils (0.125–5 μl/ml) were prepared with Brain Heart infusion (BHI) broth medium in test tube and mixed with bacterial suspensions to give a volume of 4 ml and a final concentration of bacteria of approximately 5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> CFU/ml. Final solutions were incubated at the temperatures mentioned earlier. The MIC is the lowest concentration which gave no visible growth, while the MLC was determined by sub-culturing 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l from each negative test tube onto plate count agar (PCA) plates. MLC was defined as the lowest concentration resulting in a negative subculture or giving presence of only one colony after incubation. Negative controls lacking the oil were assayed simultaneously. The experiments were carried out in three replicates.
