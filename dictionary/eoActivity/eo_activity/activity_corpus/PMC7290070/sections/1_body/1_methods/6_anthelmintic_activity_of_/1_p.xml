 <italic>Allolobophora caliginosa;</italic> an adult earthworm, was used to evaluate the anthelmintic activity of the essential oils at different concentrations. To obtain different concentrations of the essential oil (1, 2 and 3% v/v), 3% essential oil was diluted in 1% aqueous tween 80. Anthelmintic assay was carried out by dividing the earth worms into three groups each containing 6 worms (each worm ≥10 cm long). A control containing 3% aqueous tween 80 was used. The reference anthelmintic drug piperazine citrate (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was also prepared in 0.1% solution using tween 80. Time of paralysis was recorded when no movement was observed, while time of death when the worms didn’t move after being dipped in warm water (50 °C) [
