<p id="Par61">The essential oils at different concentrations (0–10 μg/ml in 2% DMSO) were tested for cytotoxicity against the fore mentioned human tumor cell lines adopting sulforhodamine B stain (SRB) assay [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The relation between survivals and the oil concentration was plotted to get the survival curve of each tumor cell line after the application of specific concentration. The results were compared to those of the standard cytotoxic drug; doxorubicin (10 mg adriamycin hydrochloride, in 5 ml IV injection, Pharmacia, Italy) at the same concentration was used as standard anti-tumor. The dose of the test solutions which reduces survivals to 50% (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) was calculated as well as selectivity index. A blank prepared from the same concentration of Tween 80 was included.
