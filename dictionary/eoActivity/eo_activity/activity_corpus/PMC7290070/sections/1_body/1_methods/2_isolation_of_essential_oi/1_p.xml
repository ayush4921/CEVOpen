<p id="Par53">Samples (100 g of dried plant in 500 ml distilled water), were separately hydro-distilled with a Clevenger apparatus for 4 h. Percentage oil yield was calculated/dry weight using the eq. (W1/W2 × 100, where W1 is the weight if the oil in grams and W2 is the total weight of dried plant used). The obtained essential oil was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and kept refrigerated in sealed amber vials till analysis. Specific gravity of the obtained essential oils was determined according to the Egyptian Pharmacopoeia (2005).</p>
