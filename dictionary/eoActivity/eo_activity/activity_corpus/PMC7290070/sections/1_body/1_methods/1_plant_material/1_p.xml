<p id="Par52">Samples of aerial parts of 
 <italic>S. thymbra</italic> were obtained from two different localities (50 plants from random locations in each locality), during fall 2017 and fall 2018 from plants in Al-Jabal Al-Akhdar in Libya, from Wasita locality (32°52′30.68″N, 13°11′14.86″E) at 150 m above sea level and from Safsaf locality (32°78′19.51″N, 21°95′23.92″E) at 661 m above sea level. The plant is not endangered, so no permission was needed for its collection. Plants identity was authenticated by staff members of the Plant Taxonomy Department of the Faculty of Science at Omar Al Mokhtar University, Al Bydaa, Lybia. Voucher specimens were deposited at the Faculty of Pharmacy, Omar Al-Moukhtar University (STTB-8 and STTB-9). Plants were dried in shade, powdered and refrigerated in closed containers until use.
