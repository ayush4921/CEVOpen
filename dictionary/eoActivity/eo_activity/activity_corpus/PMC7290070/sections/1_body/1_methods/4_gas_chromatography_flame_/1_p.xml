<p id="Par55">The GC analyses were carried out on a Focus GC® (Thermo fisher scientific®, Milan, Italy) equipped with TR5-MS fused bonded column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) (Thermo fisher scientific®, Florida, USA) and FID detector; carrier gas was nitrogen (1.5 ml/ min); the operating conditions were: initial temperature 40 °C, 1 min. Isothermal followed by linear temperature increase till 230 °C at a rate of 4 °C / min. 230 °C, then 5 min. Isothermal. Detector and injector temperatures were 300 and 220 °C, respectively. The split ratio was 1: 20. Chrom-card® chromatography data system ver. 2.3.3 (Thermo Electron Corp.®, Florida, USA) was used for recording and integrating of the chromatograms. Average areas under the peaks of three independent chromatographic runs were used for calculation the % composition of each component.</p>
