<p id="Par64">GC/MS analysis of WEO and SEO allowed the identification of 21 and 23 compounds, representing 88.17 and 93.84% in both oils, respectively during fall 2017 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Monoterpene hydrocarbons had almost the same percentage in both oils (16.6 and 16.1% in WEO and SEO, respectively) represented mainly by α-thujene and 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene which had higher percentage in SEO (8.7 and 2.3% in SEO and 3.8 and 7.5% in WEO, respectively). On the other hand, two monoterpene hydrocarbons; α-terpinolene and allo-ocimene were detected in WEO only. Oxygenated monoterpenes was the most prevailing class in both oils (35.6 and 32.1% in WEO and SEO, respectively) represented mainly by the phenolic constituents; thymol and carvacrol. Thymol was the major identified compound in WEO (29.6%), while carvacrol was the major identified compound in SEO (14.3%). Sesquiterpene hydrocarbons were represented mainly by viridiflorine in WEO (3.4%) and δ-cadinene in SEO (6.4%). Oxygenated sesquiterpenes had a much higher percentage in WEO than SEO (27.2 and 2.1%, respectively). Iso-spathulenol was the only oxygenated sesquiterpene in SEO (2.1%) which was also the major oxygenated sesquiterpene detected in WEO (13.4%) among other oxygenated sesquiterpenes present. Other classes of compounds were 27.2% in SEO and only 1.1% in WEO, represented by 2-tetra-butyl-4-methyl-phenol, which was completely absent in SEO. Generally, no significant difference in the results was observed during fall 2018 than those obtained during fall 2017.
