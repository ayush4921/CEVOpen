<p id="Par66">Determination of MIL/MLC for the essential oils was performed using broth dilution method (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). The results showed variable effects of the oils against the tested microorganisms. Highest bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects were observed for SEO against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> and 
 <italic>K. pneumonia</italic> with MIC/MLC 0.125/0.25 μg/ml, while lowest activity was for both oils against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and the fungi 
 <italic>A. niger</italic> with MIC/MLC ranging 1- &gt; 1.5 μg/ml. SEO collected during fall 2018 had also better effect against 
 <italic>B. subtilus</italic> with MIC/MLC 0.125/0.25 μg/ml. WEO had better bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity than SEO against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, while no significant effect was observed between the activity of both tested samples against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>.
