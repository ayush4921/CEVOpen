<p id="Par65">Testing of antimicrobial activity of the oils by agar-well diffusion method revealed that highest inhibition zone was observed for SEO collected during fall 2017 (55.7 ± 0.7 mm) against the gram-negative 
 <italic>K. pneumonia</italic>, while the weakest activity was observed for WEO collected during the same season, against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> with inhibition zone 11.4 ± 0.2 mm (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Both oils had significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, paired
 <italic>-t-</italic>test) higher activity than ampicillin against the tested gram-positive bacteria. SEO had significantly higher activity than WEO against 
 <italic>B. subtilus</italic> with inhibition zones 49.2 ± 1.1 mm and 39.2 ± 1.5 mm, respectively. However, the difference in activity between both oils against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> was not significant. Also, activity of both oils was significantly higher than ciprofloxacin against all tested gram-negative bacteria, except for SEO against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, which had the same activity as ciprofloxacin, while WEO had significantly lower activity than ciprofloxacin. Antibacterial activity of WEO was significantly higher than SEO against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic>. WEO had significantly higher antifungal activity than SEO; however, both oils’ antifungal activity was significantly higher than the standard amphotericin B against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, but significantly lower than the standard amphotericin B against 
 <italic>A. niger</italic>.
