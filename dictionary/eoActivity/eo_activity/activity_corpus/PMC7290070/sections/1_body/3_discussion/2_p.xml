<p id="Par70">The tested essential oils gave a promising antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi. This was evidenced by larger inhibition zones given by the oils compared to the standard antimicrobial agents used, especially against 
 <italic>S. aureus, B. subtilus, E. coli, P. mirabilis, K. pneumonia</italic> as well as 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Values of MIC/MLC were 0.125/0.25 μg/ml for SEO against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> and 
 <italic>K. pneumonia</italic> and for WEO against 
 <italic>B. subtilus</italic>. It was observed that plants growing at lower altitude in Wasita locality had better antifungal activity, while those growing at higher altitude at Safsaf locality had better activity antibacterial activity. Compared with other studies, 
 <italic>S. thymbra</italic> essential oil proved to be an available and natural antimicrobial agent that could be used in food industry to prevent the growth of food borne bacteria or to increase the shelf life of different processed foods [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. A study showed that the oil of 
 <italic>S. thymbra</italic> showed bacteriostatic activity at 0.001–0.1 mg/ml and was bactericidal at 0.002–0.2 mg/ml and fungistatic effects at 0.001–0.025 mg/ml and fungicidal effects at 0.001–0.1 mg/ml, while the oil main constituents thymol and carvacrol e also showed strong antimicrobial activity and antifungal activity that was even higher than the commercial fungicide bifonazole [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The oil is active against certain microbial strains like 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>Moniliophthora perniciosa</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This strong antimicrobial activity may be attributed to the phenolic constituents: thymol and carvacrol which proved to interfere with the cell wall enzymes of bacteria and fungi [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Studies also revealed that thymol’s antimicrobial effect, especially against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> could be due to the perturbation of the lipid fraction of the bacterial plasma membrane resulting in the leakage of intracellular materials [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Also data show that both carvacrol and thymol had desired antimicrobial effect on 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, possibly due to their ability to permeabilize and depolarize the cytoplasmic membrane [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. A study showed that at higher altitudes, plants are exposed to extreme environmental conditions, which stimulate the accumulation of secondary metabolites that causes a further enhancement in the medicinal activity including the antimicrobial effect [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Results of the anthelmintic studies augmented that of the antimicrobial results. In literature, the essential oil of 
 <italic>S. thymbra</italic> is well recorded for its anthelmintic, larvicidal, acaricidal and genotoxic activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].
