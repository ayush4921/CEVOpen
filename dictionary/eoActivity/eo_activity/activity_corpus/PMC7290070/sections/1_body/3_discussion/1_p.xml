<p id="Par69">At higher altitudes
 <bold>,</bold> average temperatures are lower than those at the base of the mountains. Elevation plays a great role in the health and growth of plants. The type and amount of sunlight, amount of water that plants can absorb and the nutrients that plants receive differ at different altitudes. The main difference observed in the composition of the essential oils was in the major identified compound which was thymol in WEO and carvacrol in SEO. It was also observed that the percentage of total phenolic constituents of WEO is 36.77% while that of SEO is 32.18%. Present results are in agreement with the previously identified compounds in 
 <italic>S. thymbra</italic> essential oil (thymol and carvacrol as well as their precursors; 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene and γ-terpenene) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Several studies showed that a variation in the essential oil composition occurred in 
 <italic>S. thymbra</italic> plants due to the effect of different factors such as different ecological conditions and even harvesting time [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Other studies showed that altitude affects the chemical composition of the essential oils of several plants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Essential oil of 
 <italic>S. hortensis</italic> gave a higher yield of carvacrol at higher altitude [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], which is the case in this present work. Qualitative and quantitative variation in secondary metabolites may be due to several other different environmental, agricultural and genetic factors such as temperature, humidity, amount of rainfall, amount of sunlight, variety of the plant, collection season and even collection timing through the day as well as method of drying and extraction of the plant [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. It is thus interesting to study the composition and biological activity at different geographical areas in order to choose the optimum source of possible drug.
