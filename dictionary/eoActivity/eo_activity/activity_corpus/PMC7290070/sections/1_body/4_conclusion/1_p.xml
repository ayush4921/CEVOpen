<p id="Par72">In conclusion, altitude may influence the chemical composition and biological activity due to a collection of conditions like temperature and climate changes. In this study, 
 <italic>S. thymbra</italic> plants collected during two successive years, growing at a lower altitude gave a better essential oil yield, higher yield of thymol as well as better antifungal activity. However, plants growing at higher altitudes gave better yield of carvacrol, improved antibacterial, anthelmintic activity and better cytotoxic activity against colon and breast cancer cell lines. Therefore, altitude at which the plant grows should be considered according to its intended use. Moreover, further studies on samples collected from more altitudes, as well studying the effect of other different environmental factors at these altitudes, such as temperature, humidity and amount of sunlight, should be employed in order to augment the results of this study.
