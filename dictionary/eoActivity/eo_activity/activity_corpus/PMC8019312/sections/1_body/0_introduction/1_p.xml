<p>Methane (CH
 <sub>4</sub>) is the world’s second most abundant greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide (CO
 <sub>2</sub>), accounting for 16% of total greenhouse gas emissions (
 <xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr">De Visscher &amp; Van Cleemput, 2003</xref>). The potential global warming effect of CH
 <sub>4</sub> is 28-fold higher than that of CO
 <sub>2</sub> (
 <xref rid="ref-107" ref-type="bibr">Stocker et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, rumen CH
 <sub>4</sub> emissions from ruminants account for 13% to 19% of the global CH
 <sub>4</sub> emissions (
 <xref rid="ref-65" ref-type="bibr">Liu &amp; Whitman, 2008</xref>); therefore, ruminant feeding is a major factor in exacerbating global warming. Therefore, reducing rumen CH
 <sub>4</sub> emissions could decrease the rate of global warming, which would be of great significance to efforts to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. CH
 <sub>4</sub> emissions also represent energy losses during ruminant farming. On average, approximately 8–12% of the energy consumed in feed is wasted in the form of CH
 <sub>4</sub> emissions (
