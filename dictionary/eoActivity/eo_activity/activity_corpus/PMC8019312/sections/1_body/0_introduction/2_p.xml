<p>Accordingly, to remedy the low production efficiency and mitigate the potential damage caused by livestock CH
 <sub>4</sub> emissions to the environment, researchers have begun to explore the roles of different feed additives in reducing ruminant CH
 <sub>4</sub> emissions. Among them, N
 <sub>2</sub>-containing compounds, probiotics, prebiotics, and plant extracts, which are feed additives that are not harmful to animal health, have been the first subjects of research and are expected to become ideal CH
 <sub>4</sub> inhibitors in the future. This article reviews the mechanism of CH
 <sub>4</sub> emission production in ruminants and the potential influence of nitrogenous compounds, probiotics, prebiotics, and plant extracts on ruminal CH
 <sub>4</sub> production.
