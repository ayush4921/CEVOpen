<p>Lactic acid bacteria, which have been used as feed additives for a long time, not only reduce CH
 <sub>4</sub> emissions per unit volatile fatty acid (VFA) output, but also improve the fermentation quality and fiber digestibility of silage (
 <xref rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, the denitrifying bacterium 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> 79R4 could prevent NO

 <sub>2</sub>-N poisoning and microbial ecosystems from impairing fermentation efficiency (
 <xref rid="ref-60" ref-type="bibr">Latham et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, 
 <italic>Bacillus licheniformis</italic> reduces CH
 <sub>4</sub> production and increases feed energy and protein utilization (
 <xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">Deng et al., 2018</xref>). However, the inhibitory mechanism of lactic acid bacteria on CH
 <sub>4</sub> is still unclear; therefore, in the future, more research will need to be conducted on the influence of lactic acid bacteria on rumen microbes and hydrogen competition to elucidate the mechanism of inhibiting CH
 <sub>4</sub> production.
