<p>In recent years, the effects of plant-derived feed additives on rumen microbial fermentation, rumen CH
 <sub>4</sub> production, and ruminant performance have been increasingly recognized. Many previous studies have demonstrated that natural plant-derived compounds are promising anti- CH
 <sub>4</sub>-generation compounds, including tannins, essential oils, and saponins (
 <xref rid="table-4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Although plant extracts have potentially significant effects on CH
 <sub>4</sub> emission reduction in ruminants, most of the inhibition mechanisms are not clear. According to research findings, the effects of plant-derived feed additives on ruminant methane emission reduction are mainly based on competition for hydrogen and rumen microbes. Competing for hydrogen is manifested in the form of increased propionic acid contents in fermentation products. Effects on rumen microbes are manifested in the number and activity of protozoa, methanogens, and total bacteria, and the results vary based on types of plant-derived feed additives.
