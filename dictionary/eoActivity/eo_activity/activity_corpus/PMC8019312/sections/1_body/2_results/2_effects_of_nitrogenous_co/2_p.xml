<p>A novel N-containing compound, 3-nitrooxypropanol (3-NOP), has recently been introduced; it can continuously reduce CH
 <sub>4</sub> production without adversely affecting animal growth or development (
 <xref rid="ref-98" ref-type="bibr">Romero-PÃ©rez et al., 2016</xref>). It is an ideal CH
 <sub>4</sub> inhibitor. The structure of 3-NOP is similar to that of methyl-coenzyme M, which is associated with the last step of CH
 <sub>4</sub> production, and 3-NOP can inhibit the activity of the reductase. Nitroethane (NE), 2-nitroethanol (NEOH), and 2-nitro-1-propanol (NPOH) can also inhibit methanogenic bacteria and significantly reduce the expression of the methyl-coenzyme M reductase gene (

 <sub>4</sub>production in turn (
 <xref rid="ref-132" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2020a</xref>). There are numerous other N-containing compounds that inhibit methanogen activity and alter the structure of rumen microbial flora, the activity of enzymes involved in CH
 <sub>4</sub> production, and the distributions of volatile fatty acids, leading to the consumption of H
 <sub>2</sub> and reduction of CH
 <sub>4</sub> production in turn.
