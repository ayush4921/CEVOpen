<p>Prebiotics are substances that are not easily digested or absorbed by the host. They selectively stimulate the growth and activity of one or several ruminal microorganisms with a positive effect on ruminal fermentation (
 <xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">De &amp; Schrezenmeir, 2002</xref>). Prebiotics suppress ruminal CH
 <sub>4</sub> production in ruminants. Prebiotics mainly reduce rumen CH
 <sub>4</sub> production by altering the bacterial community structure, influencing the permeability of the cell walls of methanogenic archaea, and stimulating other bacteria to compete with methanogens for H
 <sub>2</sub> (
 <xref rid="table-3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). According to 
 <xref rid="ref-111" ref-type="bibr">Tong et al. (2020)</xref>, the prebiotic chitosan can influence bacterial community structures by altering microbial population compositions, for example, by replacing fibrinolytic enzyme-producing microbes (
 <italic>Firmicutes</italic> and 
 <italic>Fibrobacteres</italic>) with amylolytic enzyme-producing microbes (
 <italic>Bacteroides</italic> and 
 <italic>Proteus</italic>); in turn, reducing CH
 <sub>4</sub> production.
