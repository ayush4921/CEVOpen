<p>Probiotics are a class of beneficial active microorganisms or their cultures. Probiotics could reduce CH
 <sub>4</sub> emissions in ruminants (

 <sub>4</sub> emissions. For example, the GA03 strain of 
 <italic>Acetobacter</italic> is more effective at inhibiting CH
 <sub>4</sub> production than other isolated strains (

 <sub>4</sub> production by influencing the activities of ruminal microorganisms, with no adverse effects on animals. In addition, probiotics enhance ruminal fermentation.
