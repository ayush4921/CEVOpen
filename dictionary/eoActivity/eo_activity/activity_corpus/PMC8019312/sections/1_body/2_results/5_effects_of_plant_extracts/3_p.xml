<p>Generally, plant extracts have a significant effect on reducing methane emissions from ruminants, but most of its mechanism of action is still unclear. Almost all tests are in vitro tests, which are short-term tests. At present, research on plant extracts in animals is still lacking, and the effect of long-term use of plant extracts on animals is still unclear. Therefore, in the future, we should focus on using plant extracts in animals and study the effects of long-term use on animals.</p>
