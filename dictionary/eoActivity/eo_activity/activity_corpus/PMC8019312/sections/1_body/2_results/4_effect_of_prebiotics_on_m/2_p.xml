<p>According to 
 <xref rid="ref-102" ref-type="bibr">Seankamsorn, Cherdthong &amp; Wanapat (2020)</xref>, chitosan could influence the ruminal fermentation process by altering VFA distributions and increasing propionic acid concentrations, which reduces CH
 <sub>4</sub> production in turn. However, according to some researchers, the reduction in CH
 <sub>4</sub> is associated with the degree of chitosan deacetylation, which could alter the permeability of the methanogen cell wall. In addition, 
 <xref rid="ref-112" ref-type="bibr">Vallejo-Hernández et al. (2018)</xref> observed that various yeast products could reduce CH
 <sub>4</sub> emissions by stimulating acetic acid-producing bacteria to compete with methanogens or metabolize hydrogen. Overall, compared with other feed additives, prebiotics are still relatively less applied in feed, and their types are limited. Therefore, future research should target strategies to promote the adoption prebiotic feed additives. For example, when conducting scientific research, it is necessary to strengthen contact with breeding companies so that companies can see the effects of prebiotic additives and reduce penalties due to pollution. It is also necessary to enforce the guidelines and requirements of the national environmental protection department for low environmental pollution and exploit consumers’ demand for healthy food to promote the widespread use of prebiotic additives.
