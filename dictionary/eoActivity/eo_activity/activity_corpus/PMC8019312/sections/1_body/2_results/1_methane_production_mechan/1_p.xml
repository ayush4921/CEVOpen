<p>After ruminant ingestion, the nutrients (proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates) in feed are degraded by rumen microorganisms to produce hydrogen (H
 <sub>2</sub>) and primary fermentation products that contain methyl groups such as formic acid, acetic acid, methanol, and methylamine. Afterward, methanogens convert the primary fermentation products into CH
 <sub>4</sub> and energy is obtained. There are three pathways of ruminal CH
 <sub>4</sub> production (
 <xref rid="ref-109" ref-type="bibr">Thauer et al., 2008</xref>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Fig. 1</xref>), including (1) the CO
 <sub>2</sub>-H
 <sub>2</sub> reduction pathway; (2) synthesis pathways using short-chain fatty acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, and butyric acid as substrates; (3) and synthesis pathways using methyl compounds such as methanol and ethanol as substrates. Among the three, the CO
 <sub>2</sub>â€“H
 <sub>2</sub> route is the primary pathway (

 <italic>Methanococcus</italic> that exploit acetic acid are low (
 <xref rid="ref-65" ref-type="bibr">Liu &amp; Whitman, 2008</xref>), and acetic acid-producing bacteria have a low affinity for H
 <sub>2</sub> (

 <sub>4</sub> (
