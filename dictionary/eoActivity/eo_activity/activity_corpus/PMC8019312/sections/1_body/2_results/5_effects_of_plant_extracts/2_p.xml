<p>Medicinal plant extracts (for example: patchouli, atractylodes, and honeysuckles), tannins, and essential oils have all been shown to suppress the production of CH
 <sub>4</sub> by altering ruminal microbial structure and abundance (

 <sub>4</sub> reduction are influenced by their molecular weight (

However, if the molecular weights of tannins are too high, the palatability of the diet would be adversely affected, and, in turn, the performance of animals. Therefore, it is critical to determine the optimal tannin supplementation levels. The effects of plant essential oils on rumen microorganisms could be linked to their antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, and insecticidal properties. Plant essential oils contain various active ingredients that can regulate rumen fermentation and reduce CH
 <sub>4</sub> emissions (

 <sub>4</sub> emission reduction (
