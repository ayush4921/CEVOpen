<p>Considering the results of the studies that have been published over the past 5 years, the application of nitrogenous compounds, probiotics, prebiotics, and plant extracts has been shown to reduce ruminal CH
 <sub>4</sub> emissions. There are three main ways of reducing CH
 <sub>4</sub> production: (1) reducing the number of rumen protozoa and inhibiting methanogen activity; (2) increasing propionic acid production to compete with methanogens for hydrogen; (3) inhibiting the activity of enzymes involved in methanogen activity. However, the mechanisms of action of most plant extracts remain unclear; and almost all studies are based on in vitro fermentation tests. In addition, most plant extracts have no adverse effects on animals, and they are rich in resources. Consequently, research on the effects of plant extracts in animals and their mechanisms of action should be the main research direction in the future, to enhance their application in animal production and the mitigation of the adverse effects of global warming.
