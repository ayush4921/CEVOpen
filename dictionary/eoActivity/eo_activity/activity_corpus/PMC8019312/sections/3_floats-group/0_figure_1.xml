  <title>Schematic diagram of methane production.</title>
  <p>There are three basic pathways of ruminal methane production: (1) represents the CO
   <sub>2</sub>-H
   <sub>2</sub> reduction pathway, (2) represents the synthesis pathway of short chain fatty acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, and butyric acid as substrates, and (3) represents the synthesis pathway with methyl compounds such as methanol and ethanol as substrates. Among these, route (1) is considered to be the primary route of methane production.
