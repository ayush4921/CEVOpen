<p>In terms of blood serum enzyme activity and indicators of antioxidant status, in comparison to control broilers, the experimental group broilers demonstrated an increase in gamma-glutamyl-transferase, an enzyme associated with amino acid metabolism; this increase was especially notable in Group III broilers (37% increase, p≤0.05). Broilers in all experimental groups demonstrated a higher content of amylolytic enzyme (α-amylase, p≤0.05), whereas broilers in Groups II and III demonstrated a lower concentration of pancreatic amylase (p-amylase), in comparison to broilers from the control group. All experimental group broilers had higher levels of triglycerides and lipase enzyme, especially in Groups I and II (p≤0.05). Levels of superoxide dismutase and catalase, indicators of antioxidant status, were higher in the experimental groups than the control group, with differences of 30.4-56.2% (p≤0.05) and 33.3-83.3% in Groups I and II (p≤0.05). Conversely, levels of malondialdehyde, a marker of fat peroxidation and oxidative stress, were lower in e experimental group broilers (p≤0.05,
