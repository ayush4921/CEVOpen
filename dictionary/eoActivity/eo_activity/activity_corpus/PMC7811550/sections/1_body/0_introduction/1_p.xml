<p>As an alternative to natural and chemically ­synthesized direct-acting bactericides, there has been an increase in the use of approaches that aim to suppress a microorganism’s ability to parasitize and damage biological substrates by altering its physiology. More specifically, this approach involves the search and creation of quorum-sensing (QS) inhibitors in bacteria. QS inhibitors are considered an attractive alternative to traditional infection treatments, especially for infections caused by multiresistant strains of microorganisms [

In bacteria, QS is understood to be a density-dependent means of communication, mediated by small diffusing molecules (autoinducers) and, on reaching a threshold population density, leading to functional and morphological differentiation of its constituent cells [

At the same time, discovery of this phenomenon of the ­collective behavior of bacteria has enabled a fundamental reevaluation of many examples of the functional and morphological differentiation of prokaryotes, including the formation of virulence factors and biofilm, conjugation, and sporogenesis [
