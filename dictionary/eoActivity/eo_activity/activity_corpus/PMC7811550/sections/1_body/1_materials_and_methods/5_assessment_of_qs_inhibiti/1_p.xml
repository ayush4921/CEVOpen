<p>Four different LuxI/LuxR bacterial test systems were used to determine the ability of gamma-octalactone to inhibit QS; each test system was induced by a specific acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) and contained the corresponding LuxR-like receptor protein. Three of the test systems were based on 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> JLD271, with a mutation in the 
 <italic>sdiA</italic> gene responsible for the perception of exogenous AHL; this excluded interference with genetically engineered bioluminescent constructions cloned in the host strain [
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In turn, the genetic constructs themselves were represented by plasmids with the gene sequences rhlR + rhlI :: luxCDABE, luxR + luxI :: luxCDABE, and lasR + lasI :: luxCDABE, specifically reacting to luminescence with C4-AGL (N-butanoyl-L-homoserine lactone), C6-oxo-AHL (N-(oxohexanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone), and C12-oxo-AHL (N-(oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone), respectively. The fourth test system encompassed 
 <italic>C. violaceum</italic> NCTC 13274, with the insertion of the Tn5 transposon into the 
 <italic>cviI</italic> gene. This gene is responsible for synthesizing C6-AHL (N-hexanoyl-L-homoserine lactone) and maintaining the functionally active 
 <italic>cviR</italic> gene and the receptor protein encoded by it, which is responsible for the perception of this autoinductor [
 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Due to its genetic organization, in the presence of exogenously introduced Cg-AHL, this strain forms the blue-violet pigment violacein, which can be optically registered (575 nm).
