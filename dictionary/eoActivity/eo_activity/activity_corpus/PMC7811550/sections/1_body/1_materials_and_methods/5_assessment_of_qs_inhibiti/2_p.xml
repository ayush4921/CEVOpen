<p>The ability of gamma-octalactone to inhibit the aforementioned QS systems was assessed through a series of 2-fold dilutions into a liquid nutrient media containing bacterial biotest and the corresponding AHL. Inhibitory effects were assessed through EC
 <sub>50</sub> values, expressed in mM. EC
 <sub>50</sub> corresponds to the concentration of gamma-octalactone that suppresses bioluminescence or prevents the formation of violacein pigment by 50% of the maximum possible pronounced effect, calculated relative to the following corresponding controls: 0% in the absence of AHL; 100% in the presence of only AHL.
