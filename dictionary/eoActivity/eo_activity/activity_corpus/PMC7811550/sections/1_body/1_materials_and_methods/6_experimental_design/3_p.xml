<p>At the end of each period (starter and finisher), broiler body weights were assessed. At the end of the experiment, feed consumption and mortality were assessed. Body weight gain, daily feed intake, and feed conversion ratio were calculated for each group. At the end of the experiment (42 days of age), 10 birds with an average weight were selected, and their blood was sampled through wing vein puncture while still alive.</p>
