<p id="Par14">Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was assayed by using Ellman’s reagent, DTNB [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] at 412 nm. The reaction mixture composed of 10 µL enzyme sample with 180 µL Ellman’s reagent was diluted with 10 µL dH
 <sub>2</sub>O in the presence of 20 µL Acetylthiocholine (20 mM) as substrate. The enzyme activity was measured in U/mg of extract.
