<p id="Par13">The α- and β-glucosidase activities were determined as per the method described previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] using p-nitrophenol as standard. The reaction mixture contained 50 µL of enzyme sample with 75 µL of 5 mM 
 <italic>p</italic>-N-α-D-glucopyranoside or 
 <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenyl–β–d-glucopyranoside (as substrates) for α- and β glucosidase, respectively. To the reaction mixture, 125 µL of universal buffer (100 mm, pH-7.0) was added, followed by incubation for 30 min at 25 °C. Reactions were stopped by 2 mL of 0.1 M Sodium carbonate or NaOH, and absorbances were read spectrophotometrically at 405 nm. The enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required to liberate 1 mg maltose under standard assay conditions.
