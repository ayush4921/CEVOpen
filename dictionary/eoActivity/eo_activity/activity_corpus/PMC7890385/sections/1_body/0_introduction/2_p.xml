<p id="Par4">Since EOs are mixtures of organic compounds that can accomplish multiple functions such as protein denaturation, enzymatic inhibition and membrane disintegration in animals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Some compounds may act as insect growth regulators (IGR) affecting the neuromuscular system of pests and mimic the symptoms of organophosphates. While others absorb through the cuticle and function as fumigants causing respiratory damage [

Since every pesticide has its pros and cons but the specialty of plant-based formulations being species-specific and biodegradable makes them an ideal choice for future pest management practices. The EOs from LG and TT are known to be stress relievers bearing many medicinal properties for humans. However, their valorization for pest management in general and house flies in particular has remained to be explored. Thus, in the present study, we investigated the effects of LG and TTEOs against the menacing house fly, 
 <italic>M. domestica</italic>. The efficacy of EOs were tested on different life stages of the model insect by using various biochemical techniques while the morphological alterations imposed by EO treatment were also determined using FESEM. Moreover, attempts were made to explore the composition of EOs under consideration in order to confirm the active ingredients responsible for insecticidal properties.
