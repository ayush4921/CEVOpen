<p id="Par30">To determine the insecticidal potential of EOs from LG and TT against 
 <italic>M. domestica</italic> different experiments were carried out on different stages of the model insect. In most of the experiments, tested compounds showed significant effects for the control of 
 <italic>M. domestica.</italic> In adulticidal and repellency assays, TTEO proved more effective than LGEO. In contrast, LGEO showed more potential as fumigant for (14.49 µL/0.25 L of air) pupae of house fly. The present study concludes the significant efficacy of EOs under consideration against 
 <italic>M. domestica</italic> which could be employed to breakdown its population below threshold levels to prevent the menace of some vector-borne diseases. The treatment of TTEO significantly decreased sugar, glycogen and lipid contents whereas LGEO highly affects the total protein content of 
 <italic>M. domestica.</italic> A considerable reduction of α- and β- glucosidase activities was found in treated larvae as compared to the control. The above all findings of the present study brands TT and LGEOs as potential agents for eco-friendly management of houseflies under IPM program encouraging field trials.
