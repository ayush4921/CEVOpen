<p>DPPH free radical scavenging activity of MEHA was assessed by following the method of Braca et al. [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-26-00975" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. This method has been simplified by Adnan et al. [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-26-00975" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Briefly, MEHA (100 μL) at various concentrations (50–800 μg/mL) were added to 3 mL of a 0.004% methanol solution of DPPH. After 30 min incubation absorbance was measured at 517 nm and percentage of scavenging activity was determined by using the equation: Percentage (%) of scavenging activity = [(A
 <sub>0</sub> − A
 <sub>1</sub>)/A
 <sub>0</sub>] × 100. Where, A
 <sub>0</sub> is the absorbance of control and A
 <sub>1</sub> is the absorbance of extract sample. After preparing the curve, IC
 <sub>50</sub> value was calculated using linear regression analysis. The result was obtained in triplicate and expressed as mean ± SEM.
