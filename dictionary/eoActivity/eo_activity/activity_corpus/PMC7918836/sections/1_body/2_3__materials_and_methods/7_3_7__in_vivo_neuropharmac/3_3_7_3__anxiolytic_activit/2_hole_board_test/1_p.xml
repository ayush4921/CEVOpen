<p>The hole board apparatus was used as delineated by Clark et al. [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-26-00975" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In this experiment, a grid-pattern containing 16 holes of 3 cm diameter in a flat platform with an enclosed space (40 cm × 40 cm × 25 cm) setting up by elevating 25 cm from the floor was used. The instrument contains a hole in the middle of the two connecting frames. The control (1% Tween 80, 10 mL/kg, p.o), standard (diazepam, 1 mg/kg, i.p) and treatment (200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg, p.o) groups’ mice were allowed to have free movement from middle of the board after 30 min of treatment. Total number of head dipping through the holes were counted for 5 min during the exploration by mice.
