<p>The test was accomplished based on the method described by Pello et al. [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-26-00975" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. We concurred the method used by Adnan at al. [
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-26-00975" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Briefly, the apparatus which was elevated 40 cm from the floor containing two open arms (5 cm × 10 cm) and two closed arms (5 cm × 10 cm × 15 cm) that were merged together in a central platform (5 cm × 5 cm) and exposed as plus sign symbol. The mice were distributed randomly into control, standard and treatments groups where each containing 3 mice. Treatment groups mice were orally administered 200 and 400 mg/kg body weight of MEHA, whereas control groups mice received vehicle (1% Tween 80 dissolved in water, 10 mL/kg) orally; and diazepam (1 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) was administered to the standard groups. After 30 min, each mice was kept in the middle of the platform, facing to closed arms and allowed free movement for 5 min. During experiments, open arms entries and total time spent by mice was recorded.
