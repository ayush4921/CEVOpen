<p>In the case of the computer-aided antioxidant docking study, the outcomes of the docking investigation against xanthine oxidoreductase for antioxidant activity are shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00975-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. 4-Terpineol (−6.457 kcal/mol) and T-cadinol (−6.882 kcal/mol) showed better docking scores than ascorbic acid (−6.407 kcal/mol). Contrariwise, bullatantriol (−6.260 kcal/mol) and oplodiol (−6.182 kcal/mol) also demonstrated good binding scores close to ascorbic acid. T-Cadinol showed the best docking score among all compounds in our antioxidant assays along with standard drugs by interacting with one hydrogen bond (LEU257) and six hydrophobic bonds (LEU257, ALA301, ILE353, LEU257, ILE403 and LEU404) showed in
