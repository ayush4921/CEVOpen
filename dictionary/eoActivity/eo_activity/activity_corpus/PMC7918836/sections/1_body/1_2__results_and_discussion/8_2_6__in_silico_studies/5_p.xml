<p>In the case of the antidepressant activity assay, the compounds T-cadinol (−6.892 kcal/mol), oplodiol (−6.948 kcal/mol) and α-cadinene (−7.188 kcal/mol) of essential oils in leaves of 
 <italic>H. aromatica</italic> showed the docking score near about while standard drug imipramine hydrochloride has 8.171 kcal/mol docking score (
