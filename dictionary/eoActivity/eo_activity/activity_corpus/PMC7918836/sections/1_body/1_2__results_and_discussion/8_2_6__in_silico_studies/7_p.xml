<p>There are three major compounds which have been identified based on the computational study showing the best docking scores (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00975-f010">Figure 10</xref>). It has been observed that T-cadinol showed the best results in the antioxidant as well as thrombolytic assays against xanthine oxidoreductase and tissue plasminogen activator receptor, respectively. The compound 4-terpineol exhibited the best anxiolytic results while Î±-cadinene displayed the greatest binding affinity for antidepressant activity. Moreover, It has been previously reported that essentials oils have the capability to show thrombolytic [
