Among them, we have selected 13 compounds for in silico studies to verify their target receptor binding affinity to prove the basis of their potential antioxidant, thrombolytic, antidepressant and anxiolytic activities. Previous studies have shown the best activity of certain compounds of this plant such as T-cadinol, which is an antioxidant and thrombolytic compound [
