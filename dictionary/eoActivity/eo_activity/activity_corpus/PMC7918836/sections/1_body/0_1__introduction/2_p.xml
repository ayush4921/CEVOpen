<p>Neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression are a common but serious mood illness resulting in severe symptoms such as sadness, feelings of guilt, loss of interest affecting sleeping, eating and other daily activities. If untreated, depression along with anxiety may aggravate the symptoms, worsen the complications, and ultimately lead to suicidal ideation risks [

 <xref rid="B3-molecules-26-00975" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The excessive production of oxidative reactive species (ROS) in the brain creates a cellular discrepancy condition that causes cognitive deteriorations and neurological mechanism damage [

Antioxidant therapies may be used to ameliorate the progressive tissue damage, preventing imbalance of ROS production in the nervous system. The beneficial effects in mild depressive conditions of using currently available antidepressants is still in doubt and moreover, they also produce many unwanted side effects [

Therefore, pharmacotherapy for a longer period of time, for example co-administration of antioxidants along with psychiatric agents is suggested to treat such critical health diseases. In this circumstance, the investigation of possible bioactive leads from medicinal plants covering multiple pharmacological targets is a main aim of worldwide research, because medicinal plants some of the most abundant sources of pharmacological active compounds for the development of a new drugs. Nowadays, in vitro and in vivo model in silico methods are also widely used to scrutinize the biological activities of phytochemicals with better safety, economic and drug-likeliness properties [
