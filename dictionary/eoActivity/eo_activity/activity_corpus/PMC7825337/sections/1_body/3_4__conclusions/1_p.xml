<p>The association of existing populations of 
 <italic>Ferula drudeana</italic> with the locations of former Greek villages in Anatolia and morphologic comparability between the silphion plant, 
 <italic>F. drudeana</italic>, and descriptions of the ancient scientists, implies a relation between the silphion plant and 
 <italic>F. drudeana.</italic> Furthermore, qualitative and quantitative richness of its secondary metabolites, plausible similarities between their pharmacologic activities and medicinal usages of silphion described by the ancient authors, as well as limited archaeobotanical evidence strongly suggests that 
 <italic>F. drudeana</italic>, presumably, is the silphion plant. However, until the head-to-head comparison of an archaeologic silphion sample with the extracts or resin of 
 <italic>F. drudeana</italic> is conducted, we cannot confirm the identity of 
 <italic>F. drudeana</italic> as being that of the silphion plant. We will continue to investigate the secondary metabolites of 
 <italic>F. drudeana</italic> and try to identify suitable agricultural techniques for the effective propagation, and conservation of this invaluable species.
