<p>Following the production of a fruiting stem, the green color of the stalk starts to turn into purplish-red, which is due to the senescent signaling of dying plant (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00102-f012">Figure 12</xref>). After the dispersion of mericarps, the fruiting stem dries and remains in its place for at least a year. Perhaps the remnant of the dead stalk was the source of Theophrastus’ statement about the longevity of the stem of the silphion plant: “The stalk lasts only a year, like that of Ferula”. Theophrastus also suggested that the leaf of silphion is “of a golden color” [

 <italic>F. drudeana</italic> are green, as is the case for the other extant 
 <italic>Ferula</italic> species, in late summer before they become completely dry as the leaves start losing their chlorophyll and turn into a golden color as described by Theophrastus (
