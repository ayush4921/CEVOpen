<p>In addition, HPLC-MS analyses of the methanol extract of 
 <italic>Ferula drudeana</italic> roots confirmed the presence of luteolin-7-Î²-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucoside (cynaroside) (
 <bold>29</bold>), cynarin (
 <bold>30</bold>) and chlorogenic acid (
 <bold>31</bold>) as bioactive polar metabolites [
 <xref rid="B54-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Chemical constituents of the 
 <italic>F. drudeana</italic> were highly diverse; such chemical and pharmacological diversity is unique among the investigated 
 <italic>Ferula</italic> species.
