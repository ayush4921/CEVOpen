<p>Several Apiaceae plants have been proposed to be the Cyrenaic silphion, such as 
 <italic>Feula tingitana</italic> L. [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], 
 <italic>F. communis</italic> L. [
 <xref rid="B18-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], 
 <italic>Thapsia garganica</italic> L. [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B147-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>] and 
 <italic>Cachrys ferulacea</italic> (L.) Calestani [
 <xref rid="B147-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>,
 <xref rid="B148-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>] were just a few examples to name. 
 <italic>Ferula tingitana</italic> and 
 <italic>F. communis</italic> along with the other associated North African/Mediterranean basin 
 <italic>Ferula</italic> species (i.e., 
 <italic>F. tunetana</italic> Pomel ex Batt., 
 <italic>F. marmarica</italic> Asch. and Taub. ex Asch. and Schweinf., 
 <italic>F. glauca</italic> L. and 
 <italic>F. sinaica</italic> Boiss.) were taxonomically placed in the section 
 <italic>Anatriches</italic> Korovin of Subgenus 
 <italic>Euferula</italic> (Boiss.) Korovin in the Korovinâ€™s monograph [
 <xref rid="B25-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Typical chemical compounds of these species are highly oxygenated daucane esters and sesquiterpene coumarins [
 <xref rid="B103-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>,
 <xref rid="B149-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>,
 <xref rid="B150-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>,
 <xref rid="B151-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>,
 <xref rid="B152-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>,
 <xref rid="B153-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>,
 <xref rid="B154-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>,
 <xref rid="B155-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>]. Although oleo-gum-resins of these species contain biologically active sesquiterpenoids, the noxious smell of their resins does not suggest any relation of these species to silphion. An endemic chemotype of the 
 <italic>Ferula communis</italic> associated with symbiotic interaction with a fungus has also been proposed as a potential source of silphion, however, such ecological interaction of 
 <italic>F. communis</italic> can generate a deadly variety of this plant with the production of toxic 4-hydroxycoumarin derivatives [
 <xref rid="B156-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>,
 <xref rid="B157-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>]. Due to the presence of highly poisonous compounds in its resin, 
 <italic>Thapsia garganica</italic> could not have been the source of silphion [
 <xref rid="B158-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>]. Based on its heart-shaped fruits and presence in the Cyrenaic region of Libya, 
 <italic>Prangos ferulacea</italic> (L.) 
 <italic>Lindl.</italic> (Syn., 
 <italic>Cachrys ferulacea</italic>) was also suggested as the source of silphion plant [
 <xref rid="B147-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. However, this plant is widely distributed in the Mediterranean region and is not an endemic species of the Cyrenaic region. Furhermore, the presence of 3,5-nonadiyne, an acetylenic compound with endogenous nitric oxide inhibitor activity, in its essential oil [
 <xref rid="B148-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>] does not provide sufficient evidence for the wide variety medicinal use as in the case of silphion.
