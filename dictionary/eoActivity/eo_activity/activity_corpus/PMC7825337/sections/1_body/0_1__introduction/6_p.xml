<p>A rare and endemic species of 
 <italic>Ferula</italic> growing near Central Anatolia closely resembles the description and numismatic figures of silphion (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00102-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Furthermore, the organoleptic qualities of its oleo-gum-resin exudate are also in close agreement with the description of silphion juice by Dioscorides [
 <xref rid="B13-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Preliminary phytochemical analyses of the resin indicate the presence of highly complex sesquiterpenoids and coumarins with novel structures as well as other, known compounds. The known compounds have been previously described from other medicinal plants such as sweet flag (i.e., 
 <italic>Acorus calamus</italic> L.), 
 <italic>galbanum</italic> (i.e., 
 <italic>Ferula gummosa</italic> Boiss.), rosemary (i.e., 
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> L.), sage (i.e., 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> sp.) and artichoke (i.e., 
 <italic>Cynara scolymus</italic> L.). The known biological activities of these compounds corroborate the medical uses of silphion mentioned in the monograph of Dioscorides and other sources [
