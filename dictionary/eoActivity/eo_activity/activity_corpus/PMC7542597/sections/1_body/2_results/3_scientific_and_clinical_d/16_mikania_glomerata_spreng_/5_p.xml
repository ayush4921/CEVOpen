 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Brandao et al., 2009</xref>). A clinical trial sponsored by the Brazilian government showed that the infusion of 
 <italic>M. glomerata</italic> (5, 10, and 15 g in 200 ml of water) had an unequivocal bronchodilator action and evident dose-dependent antitussive effect (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Amaral et al., 2006</xref>). A randomized study involving 62 patients compared the bronchodilator effect of 
 <italic>M. glomerata</italic> syrup and salbutamol inhaler and found 
 <italic>M. glomerata</italic> syrup did not present effect (
 <xref rid="B205" ref-type="bibr">Garcia et al., 2020</xref>). However, the overall problem with this study refers to the differences between the investigated pharmaceutical preparations. Overall, the clinical evidence is High for asthma, but Low for other types of cough.
