<p>A second group of twelve herbal medicines is to be considered as promising candidates, due to their reasonable safety margins and emerging evidence for efficacy: 
 <italic>Allium sativum</italic>, 
 <italic>Andrographis paniculata</italic>, 
 <italic>Echinacea angustifolia, Echinacea purpurea, Eucalyptus globulus</italic> essential oil
 <italic>, Justicia pectoralis, Magnolia officinalis, Mikania</italic> glomerata 
 <italic>Pelargonium sidoides</italic>, 
 <italic>Pimpinella anisum</italic>, 
 <italic>Salix</italic> sp, and 
 <italic>Zingiber officinale</italic>. The authors recommend the scientific community to prioritize working on these herbals towards their full integration into clinical use. These two groups are, in the opinion of the authors, comparable in terms of safety -and sometimes efficacy- with the three reference drugs currently in clinical use for the target symptoms, so these herbal medicines may help to mitigate the discomfort in the early stages of the disease, based on their anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antitussive properties.
