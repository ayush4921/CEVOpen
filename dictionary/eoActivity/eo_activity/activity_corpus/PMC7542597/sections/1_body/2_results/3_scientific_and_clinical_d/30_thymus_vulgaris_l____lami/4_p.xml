<p>Preclinical evidence. 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> has not been experimentally proven for symptoms of respiratory disease. However, the myorelaxant effect of ethanolic extract and flavonoids from 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> was evaluated in isolated guinea-pig trachea contracted by acetylcholine. The extract promoted relaxation, similar to DL-isoprenaline (
 <xref rid="B495" ref-type="bibr">Van Den Broucke and Lemli, 1981</xref>). The most active flavonoids were cirsilineol, thymonin, and 8-methylcirsilineol, acting as non-competitive and non-specific Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> antagonists (
 <xref rid="B496" ref-type="bibr">Van Den Broucke and Lemli, 1983</xref>). An evaluation of 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> essential oil in rats, through classic methods, showed that the essential oil presents anti-inflammatory activity. Additional experiments showed that carvacrol plays an important role in the activity, with anti-edematogenic and anti-chemotactic action. The inhibition of chemotaxis was also proven by 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments. On the other hand, thymol promoted the release of histamine acting as an irritative agent (

 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> also presents myorelaxant activity 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> (

 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> presented 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> activity against 
 <italic>Herpes simplex</italic> virus type 1 (HSV-1), type 2 (HSV-2), and HSV-1 acyclovir-resistant (
