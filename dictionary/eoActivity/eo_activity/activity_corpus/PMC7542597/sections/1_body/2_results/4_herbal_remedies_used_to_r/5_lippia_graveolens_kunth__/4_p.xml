<p>Preclinical evidence. This species has not been experimentally proven for respiratory disease. Flavonoid and terpenoid fractions from 
 <italic>Lippia</italic> genus have demonstrated a significant inhibitory effect on ROS and NO production and mitochondrial activity in LPS-induced inflammation in RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. Additionally, these fractions exhibited non-selective inhibitions against the activity of the cyclooxygenases COX-1 and COX-2 (
