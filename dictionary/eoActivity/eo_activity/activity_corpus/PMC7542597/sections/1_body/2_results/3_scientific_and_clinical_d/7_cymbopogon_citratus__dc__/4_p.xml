 <italic>Cymbopogon citratus</italic> has been experimentally evaluated for fever. However, the evaluation of the antipyretic activity of 
 <italic>C. citratus</italic> herbal tea in rats (p.o. or i.p.) did not result in body temperature reduction (

 <italic>C. citratus</italic> has been reported to suppress inhibition of TNF-α-induced neutrophil adherence, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and other lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced pathways, suppression of COX-2 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α) (

 <italic>C. citratus</italic> led to the reduction of inflammatory cells and eosinophils, as well as the expression of NF-kB/p65, in mice sensitized by Bt-antigen (
