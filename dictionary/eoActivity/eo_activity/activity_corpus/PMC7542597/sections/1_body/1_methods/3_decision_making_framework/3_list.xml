  <p>Frame the problem. The appearance of early/mild respiratory symptoms during the pandemic including fever, cough, catarrh, aches, and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, cough, sneezing (= 
   <italic>Condition</italic>) in adults otherwise healthy (= 
   <italic>Target Population</italic>). The patient did not have a test or was negative for COVID-19, but continues at risk of infection (= 
   <italic>Uncertainty</italic>). The patient uses herbal medicines alone or with drugs (= 
   <italic>Treatment</italic>, main or adjuvant). The patient experiences relief of upper respiratory symptoms within 1-2 weeks (= 
   <italic>Favorable effect</italic>). The treatment interferes with hospital/emergency treatment in case of severe acute respiratory syndrome (
   <italic>Unfavorable effects</italic>).

  <p>Set criteria for Favorable/Unfavorable effects. We followed the “General Guidelines for Methodologies on Research and Evaluation of Traditional Medicine-World Health Organization” for clinical evidence (
   <xref rid="B506" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2000</xref>) (
   <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">
    <bold>Table 1</bold>
   </xref>). We agreed on six key criteria for safety (

    <bold>Table 2</bold>
   </xref>).

  <p>Consider options to be evaluated against the treatment. Currently available over-the-counter (OTC) medications endorsed by health authorities are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (ibuprofen, naproxen, etc.), antipyretics (acetaminophen/paracetamol), and cough medicines (dextromethorphan, codeine, etc.). They may be taken as monotherapy or alternating therapies. Therefore, one of each category (ibuprofen, paracetamol, and codeine) was chosen to be evaluated based on the same criterion.</p>
 </list-item>
 <list-item>
  <p>Assess the balance between favorable and unfavorable effects and the associated uncertainty. All possible combinations of clinical and safety grades lead to four possible results: “positive”, “promising”, “negative”, and “unknown”. The last two categories allowed for the inclusion of two different degrees of uncertainty (
   <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">
    <bold>Table 3</bold>
