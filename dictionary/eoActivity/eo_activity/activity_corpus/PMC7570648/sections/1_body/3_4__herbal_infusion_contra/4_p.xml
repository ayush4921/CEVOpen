<p>Despite the potential activity of phytochemicals as therapeutics for chemoprevention, they have certain limitations that are related to the complex mixture of metabolites, biphasic effects (hormesis), and their bioavailability [
 <xref rid="B248-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">248</xref>]. Hormesis is known as a biphasic dose-response phenomenon such that a chemical has a stimulatory effect at low doses but is toxic at high doses. It is charecterized by either a U-shaped or an inverted U-shaped dose-response curve, based on the end-point measured [

 <italic>P. granatum</italic> seed oil exhibited a hormetic effect when applied to mouse mammary organ culture. This was evident by the high inhibitory effect on on tumor at low tested concentration [
