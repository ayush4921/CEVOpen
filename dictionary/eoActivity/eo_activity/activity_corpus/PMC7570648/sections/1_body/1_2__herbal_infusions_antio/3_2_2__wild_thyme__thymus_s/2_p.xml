<p>In osteosarcoma cells, rosmarinic acid showed anticancer effects by suppressing DJ-1 via regulation of the PTEN-PI3K-Akt signaling pathway [

The hexane extract of Thymus serpyllum was cytotoxic to six different cancer cell lines.The highest anticancer activity was found in HepG2 (Liver Carcinoma Cell Line), followed by HCT 116 (a colon cancer cell line), MCF7 (breast cancer cell line), MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer cell line), PC3 (prostate cancer cell line), and A549 (lung carcinoma cell line) [
