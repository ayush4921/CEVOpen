Rosmarinic acid possesses a variety of biological features, including anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, and anti-bacterial effects [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].The strong protective impact of wild thyme infusions is proposed to be the consequence of large amounts of rosmarinic acid and flavonoids (quercetin, eriocitrin, luteolin-7-

 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside, luteolin, apigenin) [

By using the pFRAP method, wild thyme infusion extracted for 30 min showed significantly the highest average antioxidant activity (268.01 mg GAE/100 g), while extraction for 60 min showed lowest antioxidant activity (111.56 mg GAE/100 g). It is concluded that the antioxidant activity of the tea of wild thyme depends on extraction time [
