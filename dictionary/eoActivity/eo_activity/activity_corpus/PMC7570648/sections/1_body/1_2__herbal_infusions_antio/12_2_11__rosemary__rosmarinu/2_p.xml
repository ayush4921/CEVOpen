<p>In view of the antioxidant and antiproliferative activities of R. officinalis, many in vitro studies confirmed these effects depending on the polyphenolic content. For example, Ðilas et al. investigated the effect of a number of oil-soluble rosemary extracts with varying content of carnosic acid, carnosol and methylcarnosol. Results of this study revealed that the extract with the highest content of carnosic acid had the most powerful scavenging ability to hydroxyl, superoxide and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)-free radicals. Tested rosemary extracts also exhibited significant antiproliferative effect indifferent cell lines. In both breast adenocarcinoma (MCF7) and cervix epitheloid carcinoma (HeLa) celll lines, the extracts yielded low IC
 <sub>50</sub> (9–10 μgmL
 <sup>−1</sup>) [

Supporting this finding, rosemary extract inhibited MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell proliferation, prevented the phosphorylation/activation of Akt and mTOR and enhanced the cleavage of PARP, a marker of apoptosis, indicating that rosemary extract modulates key signaling molecules involved in cell proliferation and survival [

 <sub>0</sub> cell population along with suppression of G
 <sub>1</sub>-S phase transition and reduction of cyclin D1 expression. As a result, the colonies of 184-B5/HER cells were reduced significantly [
