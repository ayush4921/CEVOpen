<p>Damask rose (
 <italic>Rosa damascena</italic> Mil.) belongs to the Rosacea family. It is a deciduous shrub and is the most significant aromatic medicinal plant. The damask rose is mainly used in the perfume industry and as a flavoring agent in food products [
 <xref rid="B99-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. In 
 <italic>R. damascena</italic> essential oil, a total of 22 compounds were detected by GC-MS analysis. Both citronellol (23.43%) and geraniol (34.91%) were the main scent compounds of the fresh rose flowers [
 <xref rid="B100-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. The entire flavonoid content of aqueous and ethanolic extracts of 
 <italic>R. damascena</italic> flower petals were found to be 12.73% and 32%, respectively. These flavonoids work as potent antioxidant agents [
 <xref rid="B101-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Moreover, the main volatile component of rose water is geraniol (3.3–6.6%); meanwhile, in the essential oil, the geraniol component represents 8.3–30.2% [
 <xref rid="B102-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. The rose oil showed a remarkable inhibition against acetylcholinesterase (60.86 ± 1.99%) and butyrylcholinesterase (51.08 ± 1.70%) at 1000 μg/mL and moderate activity in DPPH radical scavenging and ferric reducing antioxidant power tests [
 <xref rid="B103-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Leaf methanolic extracts (hot and cold) of 
 <italic>R. damascena</italic> displayed anti-free radical activity at a concentration of 50 μg/mL. The leaf cold extraction had the most potent antioxidant activity measured with the FRAP assay at the concentration of 100 μg/mL, compared with the hot methanolic extraction [
 <xref rid="B104-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. Fresh and spent 
 <italic>R. damascena</italic> flower extracts showed 74.51% and 75.94% antiradical activities, while the antioxidant activity of fresh flower extract (372.26 mg/g) was higher than that of spent flower extract (351.36 mg/g) [
 <xref rid="B105-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. The damask rose essential oil was found to have significant cytotoxic impacts against the cancer cell line (A549) in comparison with the normal cell line (NIH3T3) [
