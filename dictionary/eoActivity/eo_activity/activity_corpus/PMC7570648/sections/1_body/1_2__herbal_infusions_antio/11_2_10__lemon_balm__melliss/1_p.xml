 <xref rid="B169-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>]. Although distributed worldwide, lemon balm is originated from Asia and Europe [
 <xref rid="B170-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>]. The chemical composition of 
 <italic>M. officinalis</italic> oil has been analyzed using the GC-FID technique. The major components were geranial (34%) and neral (26%) [

 <xref rid="B175-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">175</xref>]. The most abundant phenolic compound found in lemon balm was rosmarinic acid (derived from caffeic acid), as well as some flavonoids such as luteolin-7-

 <italic>M. officinalis</italic> exhibited strong antioxidant activity, which were 10 times stronger than the antioxidant effects of vitamin C and vitamin B [
 <xref rid="B177-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">177</xref>]. An in vivo study has shown the efficacy of 
 <italic>M. officinalis</italic> aqueous extract in reducing Mn-induced brain oxidative stress in mice [
 <xref rid="B178-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">178</xref>]. Furthermore, antioxidant properties of four Lamiaceae species have shown that 
 <italic>M. officinalis</italic> has the highest total phenolic content and antioxidant activity compared to the other species [
 <xref rid="B173-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>]. In this regard, lemon balm extract and its major constituent, rosmarinic acid, effectively attenuated the oxidative stress by inducing antioxidant enzymes and alleviating liver damage in an animal model of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [
 <xref rid="B179-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">179</xref>]. Another study has also reported that 
 <italic>M. officinalis</italic> extracts have strong antioxidant capacity and DPPH radical scavenging activities compared to butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) [
