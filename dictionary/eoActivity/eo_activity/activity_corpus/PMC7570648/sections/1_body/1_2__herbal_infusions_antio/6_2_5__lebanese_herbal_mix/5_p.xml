<p>The antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>M. chamomilla</italic> was investigated using DPPH assay [
 <xref rid="B107-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. The antioxidant effect of water and alcohol extracts of chamomile flowers on long-term storage of anhydrous butter fat was measured by peroxide value and free fatty acids. The results of this study revealed a moderate effect in controlling hydrolytic rancidity. However, the antioxidant effect of the water extract was described to be significantly higher than the alcohol extract [
 <xref rid="B109-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. The antioxidant activity and stability were investigated with three methods, DPPH free radical scavenging system, determination of the peroxide, in addition to thiobarbituric acid numbers. The antioxidant activity of the essential oil was evaluated in 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1 mg/mL concentrations by measuring peroxide and thiobarbituric acid numbers in crude sunflower oil as a greasy food. The antioxidant activities of the extracts were increased by increasing the extract concentrations [

The highest total phenolic content and maximum antioxidant capacity of aqueous extract of chamomile tested at temperatures 25, 80, and 100 °C were achieved at 80 °C. For the aqueous herbal extract, total phenolic content was significantly correlated with antioxidant activity [

In a single-blind randomized controlled clinical trial conducted on 64 subjects (males and females; age between 30 to 60 years), the antioxidant capacity, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase activities were significantly (
