<p>Previous studies have shown that 
 <italic>H. sadbariffa</italic> is a promising anticancer plant against different cancer types. The aqueous extract of 
 <italic>H. sadbariffa</italic> was able to reduce cell viability and induced apoptosis of human adenocarcinoma cell line (MCF-7) [

 <italic>H. sadbariffa</italic> calyx was able to inhibit tumor growth, lung metastasis, and tumor angiogenesis. All these effects could be mediated via inhibition of tumor Ras, NF-ÎºB, CD31, and VEGF/VEGF-R-induced angiogenesis [

It has shown the ability of the extract to reduce the growth of breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231) and estrogen receptor-expressing breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and T-47-D) [
