<p>A review of the literature showed that cinnamon has various cytotoxic activities against different cancer cell lines, namely basal cell carcinoma, human epithelioid cervix carcinoma (HeLa), human cancer promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60), human colorectal carcinoma (HCT 116, HT 29, and SW 480), epidermoid carcinoma (A431), and human cervical carcinoma (SiHa) [

 <italic>Cinnamomum malabatrum</italic> possess protective effects against Dalton’s Ascitic lymphoma-induced cancer in mice. Such activity is due to the presence of flavonoids, essential oils, amino acids, tannins, and phytosterols [

At a concentration of 1.28 mg/mL (including 10.24 µM cinnamaldehyde), aqueous cinnamon extract treatment resulted in 35–85% growth prevention of the majority of the cancerous cells. Similarly, a concentration of 10 µM cinnamaldehyde treatment resulted in a 30% growth prevention of only SK-N-MC cells with no effect on other cancer cell lines. These results suggest that aqueous cinnamon extract had a significant inhibitory effect on the majority of cancer cells [
