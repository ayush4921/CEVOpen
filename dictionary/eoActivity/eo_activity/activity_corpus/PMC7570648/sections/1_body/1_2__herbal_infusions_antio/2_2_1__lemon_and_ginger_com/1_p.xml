 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. It was found that peels of citrus fruits are a significant source of various antioxidants, and such by-products of the juice extraction industry could be utilized as natural antioxidants. Using the whole extract instead of individual antioxidants allows taking advantage of additive and synergistic impacts of diverse phenolics, flavonoids, ascorbic acid, carotenoids, and reducing sugars present in the samples [
