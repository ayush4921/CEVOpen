  <p>The role of the oxidative stress in cancer. ROS are generated by enzymes such as xanthine oxidase (XO), NADPH oxidase (NOX), nitric oxide synthases (NOS), arachidonic acid (AA) and cyclooxygenase (COX) and by mitochondrial respiration chain, this production is countered by endogenous antioxidant enzymes (e.g., superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidases (GPXs) and peroxiredoxins (PRXs). However, over production of ROS activate several transcription factors including nuclear factor (NF)-κB, hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α, activator protein (AP)-1, p53, Wnt, and Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which regulate the expression of genes included in inflammatory responses, carcinogenesis and metastasis, tissue remodeling and fibrosis. Furthermore, ROS activate signaling pathways associated with cell growth, e.g., JAK/STAT, JNK, ERK, RAS and AKT. Moreover, ROS oxidize cysteine residues in phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and decrease their activities, hence, these changes reveal activation of the PI3K/AKT pathways. Also, HIF-1 actuate transcription of angiogenic factors, such as Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), leading to neovascularization. In addition, NOX1-derived ROS upregulate VEGF, VEGF receptors and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).</p>
