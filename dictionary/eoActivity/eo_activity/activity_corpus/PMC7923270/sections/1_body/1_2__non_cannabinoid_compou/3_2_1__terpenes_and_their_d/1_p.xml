<p>The word “terpene” was devised in 1866 by August Kekulé, a German organic chemist. Terpenes are hydrocarbons and are made up of isoprene units (5-carbon building blocks) [

This oxidation occurs during the drying and curing processes when the plant is exposed to open air. Terpenes are typically classified by the number of isoprene units in the molecule. Isoterpene is the only hemiterpenes. Hemiterpenes and hemiterpenoids such as prenol and isovaleric acid only have a single isoprene unit. Monoterpenes and monoterpenoids such as pinene (most common terpene produced across plant species), limonene, myrcene, geraniol, and terpineol have two isoprene units. Sesquiterpenes and sesquiterpenoids such as humulene and farnesol have three isoprene units. Triterpenes, such as squalene—the precursors to all steroids [
