<p id="Par33">Aerial parts (stems with leaves and flowers) of 
 <italic>S.</italic>
 <italic>hortensis</italic> were gathered in the summer of 2017 when at least 50% of the flowers were in bloom, and the volatile oil content reached its maximum. The plants were harvested in late July from a local producer (21º 19′ E longitude and 46º 9′ N latitude), Arad county. Harvested plant material was dried at 35ºC for 7 days using a drying oven (Model FD23, Binder, Germany), and voucher specimens were taken and stored at the Institute of Technical and Natural Sciences Research-Development-Innovation of "Aurel Vlaicu" University of Arad.
