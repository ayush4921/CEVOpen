<p id="Par39">SHEO constituents were determined by a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu2010, Kyoto, Japan) coupled with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (TQ 8040, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The used column was an optima 1MS + WAX column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 µm film thickness, Macherey–Nagel, Duren, Germany) with He as a carrier gas and a 1 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup> flow. The oven temperature was initiated at 70 ºC for 11 min, and raised to 190 ºC at a rate of 5 ºC min
 <sup>−1</sup> and then to 240 ºC at a rate of 20 ºC min
 <sup>−1</sup> where it was left for 5 min. Injector and MS source temperatures were set to 250 ºC and 200 ºC, respectively. The injection volume was 1 µL, with a split ratio of 10:1. SHEO constituents have been identified based on their mass spectra using the NIST 14 library and Wiley 09 library.
