<p id="Par5">TG/DTG/DTA is a useful thermo-analytical technique to investigate the mass loss of a sample as a function of time or temperature. The decomposition temperature corresponding to the maximum slopes of each mass-loss stage recorded on the ThermoGravimetric curve is seen as a peak when the Derivative ThermoGravimetric (DTG) curve is plotted
