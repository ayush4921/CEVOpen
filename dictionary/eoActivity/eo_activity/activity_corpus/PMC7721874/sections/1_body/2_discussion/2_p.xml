<p id="Par14">The chemical composition of essential oil samples unheated or subjected to heating treatment at different temperatures (160, 175, 190 ºC) and periods (0.5 and 2.5 h, respectively), is entirely different. In SHEO the principal components were γ-terpinene, carvacrol, 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, and 
 <italic>α</italic>-terpinolene, while for SHEO190-2.5 carvacrol is the major component. Depending on temperature and heating time, γ-terpinene content in the mixture had decreased linearly from 42.35% to 0%, while, carvacrol concentration increased from 32.83% to 91.36%.
