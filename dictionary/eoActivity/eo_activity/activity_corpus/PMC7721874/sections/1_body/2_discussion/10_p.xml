 </sup>, the thermal resistance or susceptibility of the essential oils may be correlated to their chemical composition. From the GC–MS and FT-IR recorded data, it was observed that SHEO contains in similar proportions two categories of monoterpenes (~ 48% γ-terpinene + α-terpinolene and ~ 42% carvacrol + p-cymene). Most likely, this particular composition determines the two-recorded steps accompanied by mass-loss. The mass-loss steps recorded on TG/DTG/DTA curves for other plant essential oils were due to the evaporation processes, as was highlighted in previously published results

 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. The TG/DTG/DTA curves of the SHEO sample recorded in air, respectively, in the nitrogen decomposition atmosphere are similar and show the stability of the sample between 30–50 ºC. In contrast, in the 50–220 ºC temperature range, TG curves present continuous mass-loss. The DTA profile curves suggest that the endothermic processes which take place are complex and involve at least two overlapped steps. These steps are better highlighted on the DTG curves.
