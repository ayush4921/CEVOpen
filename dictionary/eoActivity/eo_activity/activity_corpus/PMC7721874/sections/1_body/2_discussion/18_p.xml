<p id="Par30">All essential oil samples investigated in the present work showed this behavior of the DTG curves, and this can be seen in Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. Aiming to determine their vaporization kinetic parameters, we considered this process to be a zero-order. The kinetic vaporization parameters obtained for SHEO in air/nitrogen flow and SHEOx-y in nitrogen flow, as well as a typical Arrhenius plot used for the

  <italic>a</italic>
 </sub> calculation, are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. As the vaporization of γ-terpinene + α-terpinolene from the samples progresses, it can be observed that, in the range of 50–175 °C, the

 <sub>
  <italic>a</italic>
 </sub> values increase (from ~ 45 kJ mol
 <sup>−1</sup> to ~ 49.6 kJ mol
 <sup>−1</sup>) with the rise in the samples thermal stability and the decrease of mass-loss values. For the SHEO175-0.5 and SHEO190-2.5 samples, the

  <italic>a</italic>

 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, which are more stable to heating.
