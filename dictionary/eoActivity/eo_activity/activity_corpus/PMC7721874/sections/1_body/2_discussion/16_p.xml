<p id="Par28">Based on these observations, the first degradation step recorded in the TG/DTG/DTA curves for SHEO between 50–175 ºC can be due to vaporization mainly of γ-terpinene + α-terpinolene and to a small fraction of carvacrol + 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, while the second step, recorded between 175–220 ºC, can be attributed to the vaporization of the remained major fraction of carvacrol. Regarding the 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene compound, this vaporizes on the 175–220 ºC range but at a lower temperature than 190 ºC.
