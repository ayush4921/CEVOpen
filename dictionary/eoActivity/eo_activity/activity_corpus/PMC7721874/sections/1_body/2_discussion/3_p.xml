<p id="Par15">Starting with SHEO175-0.5, some components volatilized completely (α-phellandrene, limonene), while more thermal resistant components began to increase. In the case of SHEO175-2.5, the changes are greater, more components volatilized (sabinene, cis-sabinene hydrate) while previously detected components are now quantified (cis-α-bisabolene and caryophyllene oxide). For SHEO190-2.5 only stable thermal components remained:
