<p id="Par21">In the case of SHEO190-2.5, the total disappearance of the bands at 781, 946, and 2818 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> was found, while the band at 812 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> is given by out-of-plane C–H wagging vibrations, and the band recorded between 3200–3600 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> provided by OH stretching vibration, increase in intensity. Regarding the
