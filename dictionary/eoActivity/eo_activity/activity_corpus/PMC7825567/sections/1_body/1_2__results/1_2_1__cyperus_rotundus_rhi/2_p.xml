<p>The EO of 
 <italic>C. rotundus</italic> contains various components of terpene derivatives. According to Sofia et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-antibiotics-10-00051" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], the EO of 
 <italic>C. rotundus</italic> contains 27 components including α-Cyperone (26.15%), ß-selinene (17.99%), and Cyperene (15.73%) [
 <xref rid="B16-antibiotics-10-00051" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Similarly, the EO from the rhizome of another species of 
 <italic>Cyperus</italic> contained Cyperone (47.6%), alpha-pinene (18.8%), 1,8-cineole (14.5%), and caryophyllene oxide (7.3%) as major principles [
 <xref rid="B22-antibiotics-10-00051" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The composition and percentage of the EO can vary depending upon the geographical location of the plant and its growing conditions. Since α-Cyperone is the major component of 
 <italic>C. rotundus</italic> (26%) [

 <xref rid="B17-antibiotics-10-00051" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and its antifungal property is unknown, we obtained α-Cyperone commercially (Adooq Bioscience, Irvine, CA, USA) and investigated it further. The α-Cyperone used in this study was 99.45% pure and an analytical high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) chromatogram is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-antibiotics-10-00051">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>. The chemical structure of α-Cyperone is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00051-f001">Figure 1</xref>b. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of α-Cyperone against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, 
 <italic>C. krusei</italic>, 
 <italic>C. glabrata</italic>, and 
 <italic>Cryp. neoformans</italic> was 500, 250, 500, and 500 µg/mL, respectively. Although these MIC concentrations for α-Cyperone were higher than the MICs of clinical antifungal drugs known, we wanted to investigate α-Cyperone further for its antifungal synergy and its effect on the capsule of 
 <italic>Cryp. neoformans</italic>.
