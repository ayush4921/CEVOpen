<p>Since 
 <italic>C. krusei</italic> and other species of Candida are resistant to fluconazole [
 <xref rid="B4-antibiotics-10-00051" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], antifungal compounds with potential synergistic activity will be useful in combination therapy. Antifungal synergy was determined using a broth microdilution based checkerboard assay [
 <xref rid="B23-antibiotics-10-00051" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Results presented in 
 <xref rid="antibiotics-10-00051-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> indicate that α-Cyperone acts synergistically with fluconazole and reducing the MIC of both the antifungal agents from 31.3 µg/mL to 1.95 µg/mL for fluconazole (16-fold reduction) and from 250 µg/mL to 31.25 µg/mL for α-Cyperone (8-fold reduction). The FICI value was calculated to 0.31, which suggests synergy [
