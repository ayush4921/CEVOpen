<p>The ABTS assay was performed by bleaching the cationic radical ABTS
 <sup>•+</sup> as described by Soto et al. [
 <xref rid="B48-metabolites-10-00414" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. For the preparation of the radical ABTS
 <sup>•+</sup>, 2.5 mL of the 7 mM ABTS solution was mixed with 2.5 mL of 2.45 μM sodium persulfate for 12 h in the dark at 4 °C. Then, the resulting solution was diluted with absolute ethanol until an initial absorbance of approximately 0.70 ± 0.03 was obtained at 734 nm. The radical discoloration was initiated by adding 50 µL of the extract to 150 µL of the ABTS
 <sup>•+</sup> solution. After 15 min of incubation at 25 °C, the absorbance was measured at 734 nm and compared with a calibration curve using Trolox as standard and ethanol as blank. Results were expressed as millimoles of Trolox equivalents per gram of dry sample (mmol TE/g).
