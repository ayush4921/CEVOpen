<p>This work determined the chemical composition of the essential oil of 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> grown in the arid Andean region (Putre, Chile). The main components of the essential oregano oil were thymol (15.9%), Z-sabinene hydrate (13.4%), Î³-terpinene (10.6%), and 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (8.6%). The antioxidant activity found was not related to its chemical composition. We also investigated the use of oregano essential oil as an antimicrobial agent against several bacteria. In this context, 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> oil is a natural source of antibacterial compounds and has strong potential as a food additive or for agricultural applications. Nonetheless, safety and toxicity issues of this essential oil still need to be evaluated.
