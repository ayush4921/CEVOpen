<p>On the other hand, a study in the semi-arid zones of North Africa shows that the essential oil from oregano grown in this region is mainly composed of thymol,

 <xref rid="B29-metabolites-10-00414" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In short, we have made it clear that the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites of the essential oil of oregano grown in the arid Andean region studied is strongly affected by environmental factors. Agricultural practices also have a critical effect on the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of plant-derived metabolites.
