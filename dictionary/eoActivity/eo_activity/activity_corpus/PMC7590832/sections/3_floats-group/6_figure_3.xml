  <title>Effect of 
   <italic>P. minus</italic> essential oil on apoptosis gene expression in the liver of cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity rats. The expression of 
   <italic>p53</italic>, 
   <italic>caspase 8</italic>, 
   <italic>Bax</italic>, 
   <italic>Apaf-1</italic> and 
   <italic>caspase 3</italic> in PmEO100CP and BCP groups were significantly lower compared to cisplatin group, however, the expression of 
   <italic>Bcl-2</italic> showed significantly higher values. However, PmEO400CP groups showed contrary findings from PmEO100CP and BCP groups.

  <p>Values are mean Â± SEM (n = 6). 
   <sup>a</sup>Significantly different from control group at p&lt;0.05;
