  <title>Effect of P. minus essential oil on CYP2E1 gene expression in the liver of cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity rats. PmEO100CP and BCP groups have significantly lower expression of CYP2E1 compared to cisplatin group. In contrast, the expression of CYP2E1 was significantly higher in the PmEO400CP group. </title>
  <p>Values are mean Â± SEM (n = 6).
