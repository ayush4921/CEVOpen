 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">(Fig. 1)</xref> shows mRNA expression level of CYP2E1 gene was significantly increased in the cisplatin group compared to the control group at p&lt;0.05. Meanwhile, PmEO100CP and PmEO200CP has significantly lower CYP2E1 gene expression than cisplatin group and PmEO400CP at p&lt;0.05. BCP group also showed significantly decreased CYP2E1 gene expression compared to the cisplatin group at p&lt;0.05. Supplementary Table 1 shows mean and SEM of CYP2E1 expression level in rats.
