<p>Level of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 was significantly increased in the cisplatin group compared to the control group at p&lt;0.05 as shown in Figure 2
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">(Fig. 2)</xref>. Contrarily, IL-10 level was significantly decreased in the cisplatin group compared to the control group at p&lt;0.05. The levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-10 in the PmEO100CP group were all significantly corrected compared to the cisplatin group at p&lt;0.05. Interestingly, this reduction was significant compared to the PmEO200CP and PmEO400CP groups at p&lt;0.05. Meanwhile, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 decreased significantly while IL-10 increased significantly in the BCP group compared to the cisplatin group at p&lt;0.05. Supplementary Table 2 shows mean and SEM of the effect of cisplatin and
