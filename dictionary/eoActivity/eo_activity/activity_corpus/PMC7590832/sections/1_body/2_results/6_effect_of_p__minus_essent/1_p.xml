<p>mRNA expression of p53, caspase 8, Bax, caspase 3, Bcl-2 in rat liver treated with cisplatin and 
 <italic>P. minus</italic> essential oil is shown in Figure 3
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">(Fig. 3)</xref>. The mRNA expression of all the genes except for Bcl2, increased significantly in the cisplatin and PmEO400CP groups compared to the control group p&lt;0.05. However, the expression of these genes was significantly decreased in PmEO100CP and BCP groups compared to the cisplatin group at p&lt;0.05. In contrast, expression of Bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic gene) was significantly lowered in cisplatin, PmEO200CP, PmEO400CP and PmEO400 compared to the control group. Conversely, PmEO100CP showed a significant increase in Bcl2 gene expression at p&lt;0.05. Supplementary Table 3 shows mean and SEM of the effect of cisplatin and 
 <italic>P. minus</italic> essential oil on expression of genes related to apoptosis.
