<p>ALT, AST, ALP and total bilirubin levels were all significantly increased in the cisplatin group when compared to the control group at p&lt;0.05 (Table 3
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="T3">(Tab. 3)</xref>). Conversely, a significant reduction was also observed for ALT, AST and ALP and total bilirubin in PmEO100CP and PmEO200CP groups compared to the cisplatin group at p&lt;0.05. However, the result showed no significant difference between the PmEO400CP group and the cisplatin group. For all measured parameters, PmEO400CP group showed a significant increase compared to all treatment groups at p&lt;0.05. The supplementation of 400 mg/kg of 
 <italic>P. minus</italic> essential oil alone showed significant increase in ALP and total bilirubin compared to the control group at p&lt;0.05. Meanwhile, BCP group showed significantly improved ALT, AST, ALP and total bilirubin compared to the cisplatin group at p&lt;0.05.
