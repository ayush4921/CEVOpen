<p>Following cisplatin administration, level of GSH and activities of GPx, CAT and SOD decreased significantly corresponding to the significant increase in MDA, protein carbonyl and 8-OHdG level (all p&lt;0.05 vs. control) (Table 4
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="T4">(Tab. 4)</xref>). The PmEO100CP group showed significantly improved GSH, GPx, CAT and SOD status whilst MDA, protein carbonyl and 8-OHdG were significantly lowered compared to the cisplatin group at p&lt;0.05. PmEO100CP showed a better antioxidant status significantly compared with the PmEO200CP and PmEO400CP groups at p&lt;0.05. Meanwhile, the BCP group showed significant improvement in all measured biomarkers compared to the cisplatin group at p&lt;0.05.
