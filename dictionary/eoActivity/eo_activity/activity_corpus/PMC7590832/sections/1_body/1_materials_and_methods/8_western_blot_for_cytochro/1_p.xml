<p>Liver tissue homogenates were prepared for Western blotting as mentioned by Omar and colleagues (2016[
 <xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]). Briefly, protein concentration in the cytosolic fraction was determined using protein assay kit (Bio Rad, USA). According to Chen and colleagues (2000[
 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]), the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into cytosol is the critical early event leading to apoptosis. Protein samples were then separated by SDS-PAGE (10 µg per lane) and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. The membrane was blocked using 5 % (w/v) of bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Tris-buffered saline with Tween-20®, incubated for overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody (Cytochrome C (D18C7) Rabbit, cat. n. 11940; Cell Signalling, USA) with dilution factor 1:1000, rinsed and then incubated with 1:2000 secondary antibody (Anti-rabbit IgG, HRP-linked antibody; cat. n. 7074; Cell Signalling, USA) for 1 hour at room temperature before the detection using Clarity Western ECL Substrate (Bio Rad, USA). β-Actin (β-Actin (D6A8) Rabbit; cat. n. 8457; Cell Signalling, USA) was used as a loading control. Band density in intermediately exposed films was quantified using Image Lab
 <sup>TM</sup> 6.0 (Bio Rad, USA).
