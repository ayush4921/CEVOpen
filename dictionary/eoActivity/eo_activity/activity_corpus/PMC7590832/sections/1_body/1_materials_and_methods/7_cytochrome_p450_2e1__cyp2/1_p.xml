<p>Total RNA was isolated from the liver tissue using an RNeasy Plus Minikit (cat. n. 74136; Qiagen, Germany). The method was performed according to the manufacturer's guideline. RNA content and purity were measured using Nanodrop (DeNovix DS-11+ Spectrophotometer, DE USA). A total of 5 µg of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using Quantinova
 <sup>TM</sup> Reverse Transcription Kit (cat. n. 205413; Qiagen, Germany). For qPCR analysis, the cDNA samples were run in triplicate and β-actin was used as a reference gene. Each PCR amplification cycle includes non-template controls that consist of all reagents except for cDNA. qPCR reactions were performed using Quantinova SYBR
 <sup>®</sup> Green RT-PCR Kit (cat. n. 208154; Qiagen, Germany) and was conducted using the CFX96 Touch
 <sup>TM </sup>Real-Time PCR Detection System (BioRad, USA). After the qPCR reaction, the quantitation cycle (Cq) was determined for each sample from the amplification plot. ΔΔCq value was calculated by subtraction of the β-actin Cq from each sample Cq and used for data analysis. PCR primers for
