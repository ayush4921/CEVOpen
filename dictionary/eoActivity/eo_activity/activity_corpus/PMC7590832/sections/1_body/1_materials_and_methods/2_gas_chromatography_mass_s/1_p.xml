 <italic>P. minus</italic> essential oil compounds were identified using GC-MS analysis (Ahmad et al., 2014[
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]) using the Clarus 600 GC-MS system (PerkinElmer, USA). Volatile compounds were separated using a 30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 µm Elite-5MS column. The injector port was heated to 250 °C with helium as carrier gas at a constant flow of 1 mL·min
 <sup>-1</sup>. All mass spectra were acquired in the electron impact mode (EI). The MS parameters were as follows: EI mode, an ionization voltage of 70 eV, an ion source temperature of 200 °C and a scan range of 40 - 600 Da. The peaks were tentatively identified based on a library search using NIST and Wiley Registry 8 Edition (Ahmad et al., 2014[
