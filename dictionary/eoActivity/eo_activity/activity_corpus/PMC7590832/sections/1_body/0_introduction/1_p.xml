<p>Cancer has emerged as one of the major causes of death worldwide. Cisplatin is an effective chemotherapeutic drug used to treat various types of cancers such as cancers of testis, lung, colon, cervix and ovary (Ko et al., 2014[
 <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]); however its usage may also cause various side effects including hepatotoxicity. Cisplatin tends to accumulate in liver (Gong et al., 2015[
 <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]; Lebwohl and Canetta 1998[
 <xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]) and caused hepatotoxicity in cancer patients after a high dose of treatment (40 - 100 mg/m
 <sup>2</sup>) (Al-Malki and Sayed, 2014[
 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]; Cersosimo, 1993[
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]). Oxidative stress plays an important role in cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity. Administration of cisplatin especially at higher dose results in hepatotoxicity via formation and activity of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Cichoż-Lach and Michalak, 2014[
 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]; Cüre et al., 2016[
 <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]). Excessive ROS can stimulate oxidative damage through oxidation of macromolecules such as protein, lipid and DNA. Dysregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and unregulated apoptosis also play an important role in cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity (El-Shitany and Eid, 2017[
