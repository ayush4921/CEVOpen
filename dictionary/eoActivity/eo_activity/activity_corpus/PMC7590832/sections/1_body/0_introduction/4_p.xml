<p>Previous studies have shown that essential oil has hepatoprotective effects in various animal models (Bouzenna et al., 2016[

 <italic>P. minus</italic> contains various medicinal values and yields high levels of essential oil (72.54 %) mainly of aliphatic aldehydes, terpenoids and organic acids (Baharum et al., 2010[
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]). Previous researchers also identified monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes in 
 <italic>P. minus</italic> essential oil including ɑ-humulene, ɑ-curcumene, β-caryophyllene, δ-cadinene, farnesol and nerolidol (Baharum et al., 2010[
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; Rusdi et al., 2016[
 <xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]). To the best of our knowledge, hepatoprotective effects of 
 <italic>P. minus</italic> essential oil in cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity model is unknown although it yields high levels of essential oil with proven antioxidant activities. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate the possible protective effects of 
 <italic>P. minus</italic> essential oil on cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity in adult male rats with emphasis on oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis.
