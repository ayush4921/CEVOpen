<p>Meanwhile, the supplementation of 
 <italic>P. minus</italic> essential oil at a higher concentration especially in PmEO400CP showed contrary results with the PmEO100CP group. This finding suggested that at higher concentration of 
 <italic>P. minus</italic> essential oil might not protect the liver from oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis in cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity. However, these negative observations were not significantly in PmEO400 alone. The expression of CYP2E1 was also found significantly higher in the PmEO400CP group. These findings suggested that the compounds present at a higher dose in 
 <italic>P. minus</italic> essential oil might interact with cisplatin to increase CYP2E1 which then augments oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis.
