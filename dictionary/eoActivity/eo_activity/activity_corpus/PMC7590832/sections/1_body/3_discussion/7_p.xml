<p>The supplementation of 400 mg/kg of 
 <italic>P. minus</italic> essential oil in PmEO400CP group up-regulates the CYP2E1 expression compared to control and cisplatin group in rat's liver. This might be due to the presence of aldehydes and alcohols in 
 <italic>P. minus</italic> essential oil at high concentration in PmEO400CP which enhanced the CYP2E1 activity in the liver. Acetone, aldehyde and alcohol were cytochrome P450 isoenzyme inducers especially CYP2E1 (Ahmed Laskar and Younus, 2019[
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]; Sánchez-Catalán et al., 2008[
 <xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]). The current findings is concurrent with Lu and Cederbaum (2006[
 <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]) who demonstrated the combination of cisplatin and acetone increases the CYP2E1 activity two to four-fold as compared to cisplatin group alone. ROS produced by CYP2E1 together with the presence of aldehyde and alcohol might promote the formation of hydroxyl radicals and these radicals induce toxicity by interrupting the cell membrane through lipid peroxidation and the formation of MDA. In addition, Quintanilha and colleagues (2017[
