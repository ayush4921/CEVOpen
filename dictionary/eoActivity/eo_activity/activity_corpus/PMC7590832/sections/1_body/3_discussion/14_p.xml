<p>Supplementation of 
 <italic>P. minus</italic> essential oil at the dose of 100 mg/kg lowered the gene expression of p53, Bax, cytochrome c, caspase 8, Apaf-1, caspase 9, caspase 3 and higher the Bcl-2 compared to the cisplatin group. This might be due to the antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties of 
 <italic>P. minus </italic>essential oil as suggested by Dasari and Tchounwou (2014[
 <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]). α-Caryophyllene and β-caryophyllene are sesquiterpenes that were reported to have anti-oxidant property which reduced the lipid peroxidation, increased the antioxidant status, protected against the DNA damage (Sheweita et al., 2016[
 <xref rid="R76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]) and ameliorated apoptosis (Mahmoud et al., 2014[
 <xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]). In addition, β-caryophyllene reduced caspase 3 activity in cisplatin-induced cell death model 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (Horváth et al., 2012[
 <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]). Meanwhile, valencene and seychellene are also among sesquiterpene compounds in 
 <italic>P. minus</italic> essential oil. Valencene was believed to efficiently enhance Bcl-2 and decrease caspase 3 expression in 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1)-induced apoptosis (Hemanth Kumar et al., 2013[
 <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]). Seychellene is one of the main compound in 
 <italic>P. cablin</italic>, and has been suggested to prevent the release of cytochrome c into cytosol in human neuroglioma cell line induced by hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) (Kim et al., 2010[
 <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]). Therefore, at the dose of the 100 mg/kg 
 <italic>P. minus</italic> essential oil, sesquiterpenes compound was suggested to play the main role in protecting apoptosis.
