 <italic>P. minus</italic> essential oil also consists of α-caryophyllene and according to Fernandes and colleagues (2007[
 <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]), α-caryophyllene was found to inhibit TNF-α signaling pathway and suppress the IL-1β and IL-6 generation in carrageenan-induced rats. Besides, β-caryophyllene also exhibited the anti-inflammatory effect against cisplatin-induced nephropathy in a murine model. In addition, α-caryophyllene and β-caryophyllene were found to inhibit the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NF-kB activation and neutrophil migration in animal models of inflammation (Medeiros et al., 2007[
 <xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]). Valencene, and seychellene were found to be among sesquiterpenes found in 
 <italic>P. minus</italic> essential oil. Tsoyi and colleagues (2011[
 <xref rid="R82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]) proved that valencene, which is the main active compound in 
 <italic>Cyperus rotundus,</italic> induced expression of Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) responsible for anti-inflammatory reaction in mice. On the other hand, seychellene which was found in 
 <italic>Pogostemon cablin</italic> also down-regulated the expression of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells (Su et al., 2012[
 <xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]). Bisabolene, α-bergamotene and β-farnesene commonly found in 
 <italic>P. minus</italic> essential oil which possessed anti-inflammatory effects against adjuvant-induced arthritis in rats also showed an effective result in decreasing oxidative stress in the liver (Castro Ghizoni et al., 2017[
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]).
