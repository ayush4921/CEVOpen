<p>To the best of our knowledge there is no previous study using either 
 <italic>in vitro </italic>or
 <italic> in vivo</italic> research models to identify the beneficial effects of 
 <italic>P. minus</italic> essential oil. However, there were studies on 
 <italic>P. minus</italic> using aqueous, methanolic and ethanolic extract which showed no toxic effect at as much as 2000 mg/kg dose. Ebada (2018[
 <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]) has shown that chamomile essential oil at a dose of 250 mg/kg and cumin essential oil at a dose of 400 mg/kg increased the serum transaminase and serum bilirubin in acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity. In addition, Rojas-Armas and colleagues (2019[
 <xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]) demonstrated that in a subacute toxicity study, a dose of 100 mg/kg 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> essential oil did not cause a significant difference in serum transaminase and total bilirubin level compared to the control group. Therefore, in order to determine the effective dose of 
 <italic>P. minus</italic> essential oil, doses of 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg were chosen based on Ebada (2018[
 <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]), as well as Rojas-Armas and colleagues (2019[
 <xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]).
