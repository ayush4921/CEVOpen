<p>Meanwhile, the supplementation of 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg 
 <italic>P. minus</italic> essential oil showed significantly higher level of TNF-α, IL1-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and significantly lower level of IL-10 compared to control group and also no differences compared to cisplatin group, which revealed that higher concentration of 
 <italic>P. minus</italic> essential oil might not protect the liver from inflammation process. The interaction of cisplatin and aldehyde through the activation of CYP2E1 will accelerate the production ROS which activate the TNF-a signaling pathways and the release of inflammatory cytokine such as IL-1a, IL-1B and IL-6 (Vyas et al., 2014[
 <xref rid="R84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]). This finding is probably due to high concentration long-chain aldehyde such as decanal and dodecanal (dodecyl aldehyde) at 10.4 % and 39.4 %, respectively as well as the presence of cisplatin.
