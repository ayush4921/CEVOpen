<p>The major volatile compound in 
 <italic>P. minus</italic> essential oil are aldehydes, terpenoids and organic acids. Aldehydes, such as decanal and dodecanal while cyclolongifolene oxide, α-caryophyllene, β-caryophyllene, seychellene, α-bergamotene, valencene and isolongifolol are the main sesquiterpenes found in 
 <italic>P. minus</italic> essential oil. These findings were similar with Rusdi and colleagues (2016[
 <xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]) as well as Ahmad and colleagues (2014[
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]). α-Caryophyllene and β-caryophyllene were found to reduce the anti-inflammatory mediators in rats (Rogerio et al., 2009[
 <xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]). Besides that, β-caryophyllene was also found to improve cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in a cannabinoid 2 receptor-dependent manner (Calleja et al., 2013[
 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]). Seychellene, α-bergamotene and valencene were found to have high antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and also anti-apoptotic properties against chemical-induced toxicity in rats (Huang et al., 2018[
 <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]; Su et al., 2012[
 <xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]; Tsai et al., 2010[
