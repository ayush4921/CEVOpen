<p>β-Caryophyllene is a FDA-approved food additive that contains many medicinal properties such as antioxidant (Sharma et al., 2016[
 <xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]), anti-inflammatory (Bento et al., 2011[
 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]), antimicrobial (Donati et al., 2015[
 <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]), anti-apoptosis (Horváth et al., 2012[
 <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]) and chemopreventive effects (Bridgeman and Abazia, 2017[
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]). The protective effects of β-caryophyllene on liver have been confirmed in a liver fibrosis model induced by surgical ligation of the common bile duct (Mahmoud et al., 2014[
 <xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]) and in carbon tetrachloride-induced liver fibrosis (Calleja et al., 2013[
 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]) whereby it normalized liver transaminase and bilirubin level. Furthermore, when combined with silymarin, it was also found to ameliorate ketoprofen-induced hepatotoxicity in rats (Kelany and Abdallah, 2016[
 <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]). In the present study, the supplementation of β-caryophyllene significantly lowered the level of liver enzyme and bilirubin. Therefore, this explains its role as a potential hepatoprotective agent. The present finding supports (Horvath et al., 2012[
 <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]) where in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity, β-caryophyllene was found to reduce the antioxidant status, inflammatory markers (TNF-α and IL-1β) and apoptosis marker (caspase 3).
