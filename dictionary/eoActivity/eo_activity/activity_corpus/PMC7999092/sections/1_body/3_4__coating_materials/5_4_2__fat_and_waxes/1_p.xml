<p>Commonly, lipids are known as oils or fats depending on their physical form at room temperature, e.g., liquid or solid state. Furthermore, these substances are organized as nonpolar (cholesterol or triacylglycerol) or polar (phospholipids) compounds, which leads to important variations in their solubility and functional properties. Lipid-based delivery systems possess several advantages including possibility of trapping BACs with different solubility. In particular, instable molecules with high hydrophobicity can be preserved from degradation, thus providing their better stability during storage [
