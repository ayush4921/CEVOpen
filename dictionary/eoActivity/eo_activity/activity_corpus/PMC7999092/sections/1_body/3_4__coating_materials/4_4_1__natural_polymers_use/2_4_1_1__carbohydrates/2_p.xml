<p>Walls made of chitosan have several advantages for nanocapsules synthesis, such as controlled release, use of safe organic solvents, and simple application in comparison to other polymers [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Specifically, the one formed from the total or partial deacetylation of chitin has been approved as GRAS, and recently it is receiving much attention for its use in the encapsulation of bioactive ingredients and nutraceuticals [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Mainly, due to non-toxicity, antimicrobial properties, biocompatibility, stability, biodegradability and its ability to develop films and particles [

 <xref rid="B36-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Chitosan with sodium alginate were efficiently used to nanoencapsulate bioactive substances extracted from Egyptian prickly pears for application in guava juice [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], since it allowed the improvement of the antioxidant activity of the BACs at the same time that it enhanced their quality and stability. The NPs formulated with chitosan–sodium alginate and with chitosan were those showing the best results. Chitosan can also be efficiently nanoencapsulated in combination with γ-poly glutamic acid to improve the antimicrobial activity of rosemary (
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> L.) extract characterized by being poorly soluble [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The combination of the recognized properties of this plant as a significant source of antimicrobial and antioxidant compounds (mainly attributed to carnosic acid and carnosol) and the improvement of stability and solubility achieved through nanoencapsulation resulted in a successful application as antimicrobial NPs in beverages. This is demonstrated by the reduction in the microbial counts of 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (0.5–3.6 log CFU/mL) in a ready-to-drink barley tea beverage. This reduction was size dependent, so that highest activity was observed for the largest particles (no counts vs. &lt;4.0 log CFU/mL and ≅6 log CFU/mL for 600.6 nm, 212.2 nm and control samples, respectively).
