<p>Proteins are biological polymers made of amino acids connected together by peptide bonds. There are diverse amino acids that are arranged according to their features in the side groups as aliphatic, aromatic, charged (positive or negative) or polar. Proteins widely used in food manufacturing are extracted from herbal (soy and zein) and animal (casein, egg and whey protein) sources or by hydrolysis. Proteins have significant dietary value and abundant functional properties, for example gelation, emulsification or water binding capacity. Due to their versatility, a variety of structures can be generated (particles, films, fibers, tubules and hydrogels), offering the opportunity for delivering hydrophobic or hydrophilic bioactive components [
