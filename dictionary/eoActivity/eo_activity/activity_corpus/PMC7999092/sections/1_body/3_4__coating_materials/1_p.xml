<p>Choice of adequate coating materials for particular purpose is vital for encapsulation. A number of parameters should be evaluated prior designing encapsulation system, e.g., the particle size, the final physical state, safety and environmental concerns and the economic issues. Regarding the function of the different ingredients, the wall material should be selected in order to satisfy specific target requirements [

More specifically, the features of an adequate shell include: (1) stabilization and preservation the core material against humidity, oxygen and light; (2) promote controlled diffusion under specific conditions; (3) inert with the BACs; (4) be food-grade and containing no adverse tastes and flavors; (5) present film-forming ability, low viscosity and high solubility and (6) low cost.
