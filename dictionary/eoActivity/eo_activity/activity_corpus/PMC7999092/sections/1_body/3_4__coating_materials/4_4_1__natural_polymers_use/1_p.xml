<p>Today the trend is towards the use of biodegradable polymeric NPs due to their favorable properties such as good biocompatibility, easy design and preparation, structure variations and interesting biomimetic characters [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. These natural biopolymers are produced by controlled assembly of two different biopolymers such as protein and polysaccharide molecules. In addition, the protection of bioactive ingredients by nanocomplexes production through electrostatic attractions between negatively charged polysaccharides and positive proteins emerges as a novel and promising technology, since provides higher stability of NPs. Therefore, the polysaccharide–protein nanostructures are more interesting than pure single biopolymer NPs. Substances as chitosan, cellulose, maltodextrins, sodium alginate, gelatin, albumin, zein or whey protein are biopolymers that have been extensively studied for food encapsulation [

 <italic>w/w</italic>) were used to nanoencapsulate 
 <sc>d</sc>-limonene at different pH values (3, 6 and 9) [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The results suggested that these wall materials would be able to nanoencapsulate (EE of 88%) appreciable amounts of D-limonene at high stability (83.0–98.5%).
