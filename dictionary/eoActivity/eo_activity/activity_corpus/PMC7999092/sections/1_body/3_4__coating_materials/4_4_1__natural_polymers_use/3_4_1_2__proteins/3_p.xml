<p>Whey, sodium caseinate and soy protein isolates have been used routinely for encapsulation of target compounds. Casein micelles have been suggested as appropriate carriers for different active ingredients, such as vitamin D3, curcumin, polyphenols, Î±-tocopherol, quercetin or polyunsaturated fatty acids [

 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic>), which has been related with numerous health benefits, including inhibition of cancer cell proliferation, antitumor activity, antibiotic (against bacteria and viruses), antioxidant potential, decrease of ageing, anti-inflammatory capacity and antitumor activities [

Despite its promising medicinal utilities, the efficient and wide application of curcumin have been limited owning to its low bioavailability derived from a high hydrophobicity, poor aqueous solubility, poor absorption, low stability and rapid metabolism. In this sense, nanoencapsulation can be a useful technique to avoid the technological obstacles and to improve the conservation of this functional compound and its delivery [

In this regard, a recent study developed casein NPs of sodium caseinate with curcumin or quercetin by hierarchical approach (ligand binding to sodium caseinate and then either reassembling the micellar nanostructures or formation casein NPs) [
