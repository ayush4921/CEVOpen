<p>Zein is a proline-rich storage protein from corn commonly utilized in food industry, which is characterized by a ratio of three quarters hydrophobic and one quarter hydrophilic amino acid units, which results in a lack of solubility in aqueous media. In contrast, it presents good solubility in various organic solvents, such as ethanol. Due to this, zein is a promising building block for preparing encapsulation and delivery systems for water-insoluble compounds, such as Ï‰-3 fatty acids, essential oils, vitamin D3, resveratrol, quercetin, curcumin and lutein [
