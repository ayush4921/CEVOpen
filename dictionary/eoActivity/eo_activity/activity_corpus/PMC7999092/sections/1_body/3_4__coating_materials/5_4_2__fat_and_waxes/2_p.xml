 <xref rid="B66-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] summarized the most recent nanoencapsulation developments incorporating formulations that are mainly based on lipid components. Authors concluded that nanocapsules containing lipids are interesting alternatives to other carriers due to a series of features they offer. They include improved solubility, high bioavailability and a controlled release of the nanoencapsulated food active ingredients. Likewise, Kiani et al. [
 <xref rid="B67-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] described lipids as suitable carriers to achieve a good solubility, stability and efficacy of BACs. In fact, these authors produced novel form of vitamin D3 loaded in lipid nanocapsules by phase inversion method, and after a sensory evaluation, proved their potential application for development of fortified milk.
