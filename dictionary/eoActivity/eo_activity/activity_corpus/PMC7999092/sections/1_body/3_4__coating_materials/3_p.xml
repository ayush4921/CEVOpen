<p>Despite nanoencapsulation offers a large number of benefits there is increased awareness about the possible negative side effects, since some materials can be harmful to human health and, in fact, some substances that are well known and previously used in diverse products present new potential risks due to fact that nanomaterials have novel properties and different molecular and atomic dimensions. The most appropriate nanoscale carrier materials for food applications are carbohydrate-, protein- or lipid-based alternatives [
