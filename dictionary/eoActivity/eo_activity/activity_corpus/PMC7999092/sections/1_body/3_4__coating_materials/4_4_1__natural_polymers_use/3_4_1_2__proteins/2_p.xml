<p>Both, single or a combination of different proteins can be applicable to nanodelivery structures. Fathi et al. [
 <xref rid="B56-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] reviewed protein-based nanoencapsulation approaches, including the physicochemical characteristics. Protein modification processes were useful to extend the functionality and behavior of bioactive agents in different protein-based nanocarriers, hence it is the main candidate for the formation of nanoparticles, nanogels and nanofibers from different origins. In this sense, Balandrán-Quintana et al. [
 <xref rid="B57-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] obtained NPs from α-lactalbumin with an average diameter of 404 nm and an average inner diameter of 71 nm, while Monteiro et al. [
 <xref rid="B58-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] mixed two proteins (α-lactalbumin and lysozyme) to produce micro- and nanostructures.
