 <italic>Humulus lupulus</italic> L. (Hop) is a perennial and climbing plant from the family of Cannabaceae, being flavonoids, humulones (α-acids) and lupulones (β-acids) the main components of hop extract. Lupulon is the main component of β-acids that along with the xanthohumol are used to substitute synthetic additives in food products. In this way, lupulon–xanthohumol loaded nanoliposomes were incorporated as promising nitrite replacer in cooked beef-sausage. In addition to preventing microbial growth and lipid oxidation, nanoencapsulation allowed it to mask the associated bitter taste, avoiding adverse effects on sensory properties [
