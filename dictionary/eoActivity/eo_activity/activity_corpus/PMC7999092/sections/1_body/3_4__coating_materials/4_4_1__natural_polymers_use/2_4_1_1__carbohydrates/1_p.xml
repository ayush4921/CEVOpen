<p>The most commonly used carbohydrates are chitosan, pectins, maltodextrins, corn syrup solids, acacia gums (gum Arabic), starch, maltodextrins and Î²-cyclodextrins. They have important properties, e.g., non-toxicity, good stability, biodegradability and bioadhesibility, which promote their application as delivery systems [

In particular, their thermal stability makes them suitable carriers for protecting thermolabile compounds during food processing under high temperatures, hence acting as an interesting option that is superior to lipid- or protein-based materials [

Frequently these polysaccharide-based delivery systems are classified by their origin as: herbal (e.g., pectin, starch or cellulose), algal (e.g., alginate and carrageenan), microbial (e.g., dextran and xanthan gum) and animal (e.g., chitosan) sources [
