<p>Cyclodextrins and its derivatives have been recommended as food additives with a variety of purposes, including the protection of lipophilic compounds, being able to improve the solubility of food colorings and vitamins, stabilize flavors, essential oils and other edible constituents, and to mask undesirable tastes or odors. Among cyclodextrins, β-cyclodextrin is the most frequently used. Recently, Quilaqueo et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] reported the convenience of using β-cyclodextrin complexes to protect the bioactive properties of piperine, a beneficial nitrogenous compound with poor solubility in water, increasing its bioaccessibility and its in vitro antioxidant capacity along the gastrointestinal tract. The higher ratio β-cyclodextrin complexes: piperine (4:1) allowed it to obtain the highest loading efficiency and release in the colon. In contrast, despite the fact that nanoencapsulation is associated with masking some types of unpleasant odors and tastes [

In the same way, the nanoencapsulation of lutein with hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose phthalate protected this functional food component, thus improving the application of lutein in the food industry [
