<p>All this makes zein has been widely used in the food industry as a coating material [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In this regard, there are some studies about the electrospinning of zein in the food science, especially by inclusion functional compounds inside them. Dai et al. [
 <xref rid="B65-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] investigated the formation mechanism, structural characterization and stability of curcumin in zein-lecithin composite NPs formed by antisolvent coprecipitation. Authors stated that these NPs could be a potential carrier for water-insoluble bioactive components with enhanced EE (99.83%) and chemical stability.
