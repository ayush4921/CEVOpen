<p>In recent times, nanotechnology is getting more and more attention from food and health care sectors due to the large number of benefits it offers [

Both the minimum particle size and a significant surface area give nanostructured materials their exceptional properties and capabilities for their application in the food industry. Although, in comparison to other fields, nanotechnology in food science only began to address its application that could provide important benefits for global society. Major improvements have been focused on modifying the texture of food products, encapsulating edible substances or additives, elaborating original flavors and improving the bioaccessibility/bioavailability of dietary components [

 <xref rid="B6-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] stated that there is evidence to declare that the present direction of nanotechnology studies in food sector cover five general areas: (1) food manufacturing, (2) packaging, (3) safety and quality, (4) nutraceuticals and (5) functional foods.
