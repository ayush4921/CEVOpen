<p>Furthermore, nanostructures can be also organized into two basic classes: single-core and multicore. Particularly, in the case of nanocarriers, two mechanisms of nanosphere and nanocapsule have been described by Jafari [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This author classified nanoencapsulation techniques into five groups, which takes into account the main procedure/component used to develop the nanocapsules, including: (1) lipid formulations (nanoemulsions, nanoliposomes and nanostructured lipid carriers); (2) natural nanocarriers (caseins, cyclodextrins, nanocrystals and amylose nanostructures); (3) specialized equipment (electrospun nanofibers, electrosprayed NPs and nanospray dried particles); (4) functional biopolymeric NPs and (5) disparate techniques (protein nanotubes and carbohydrate nanogels).
