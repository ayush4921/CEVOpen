<p>Finally, Pisoschi et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] compiled a specific list of nanostructure and nanoencapsulation techniques that are adequate for antioxidants and antimicrobials as: (1) association micelles-based nanoencapsulation; (2) lipid-based nanoencapsulation (nanoemulsions, nanoliposomes and solid lipid NP incorporation); (3) encapsulation based on biologically-derived and non-biological polymeric nanocarriers (coacervation, ionic gelation, electrostatic complexation, incorporation in layer-by-layer deposited nanolaminates, emulsification-solvent evaporation, nanoprecipitation and supercritical fluid technique); (4) cyclodextrin-based nanocapsule incorporation-molecular inclusion; (5) nanofiber encapsulation-electrospraying and electrospinning; (6) carbon nanotube and nanocomposite encapsulation; (7) drying techniques that follow some of the nanoencapsulation techniques (freeze-drying and spray-drying) and (8) encapsulation in specialized nanostructures (
