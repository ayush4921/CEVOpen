<p>Particle size is considered the primary characteristic, which would determine the functional properties of the nanoencapsulated product [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. A further increase in polymer concentration and/or double-walled NPs gave rise to an increase in the particle size but also to a change in the morphology [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In this way, smaller particle size leads to better dissolution behavior, probably due to the increase in surface area to volume ratio of NPs. Moreover, polydispersity index (PDI) is also an important factor that indicates size distribution. It has been established that values higher than 0.6 are regarded to indicate polydispersity, while values under 0.3 are considered to indicate monodispersity. Therefore, this parameter could indicate that size of NPs was or not distributed uniformly in suspensions [
