<p>On the other hand, relatively new electrospinning techniques for food science, received notable attention over the last years due to simplicity, versatility and effectiveness [

In the same sense, nanofibers formed by electrospinning have numerous structural and functional benefits, for instance a large surface-to-volume ratio owed to large porosity, encapsulation efficiency (EE) (without thermal energy) and the better stability of the final encapsulated ingredients [

Similarly, electrospraying or electrohydrodynamic atomization is an original and simple approach based on handling the high electrostatic potential. In particular, electrospraying has been reported as suitable for encapsulation of heat sensitive food ingredients due to the nonthermal nature of this method [
