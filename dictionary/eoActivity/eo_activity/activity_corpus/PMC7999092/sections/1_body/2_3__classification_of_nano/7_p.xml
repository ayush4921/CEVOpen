<p>In the case of zeta potential (ZP), which establishes the potential differences between the immobilized and dynamic ionic layers on the charged particles, plays an important role in the stability of NPs [

In addition to these parameters, ionic strength, pH, type and concentration of coating materials, and the ratio between them, are effective on the amount of surface charges and electrophoretic mobility resulting in variable ZPs of complexes [
