<p>The benefits offered by these nanodelivery systems depend on the compatibility of NPs properties with the properties of the BACs and the desired application [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], which allow their usage in a wide diversity of solid foods and beverages [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It is essential to take into account several parameters for optimal NP preparations, including pH, selection of organic solvents, processing time, type of polymer(s), presence of surfactants, target compound(s)-to-polymer(s) ratio and method(s) of drying [
