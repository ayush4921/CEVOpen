<p>Traditionally, nanoencapsulation technologies have been divided into two general mechanisms for the elaboration of nanomaterials: “top-down” and “bottom-up”. According to the “top-down” technique, particle size is decreased with encapsulation by the application of accurate tools. On the other hand, the “bottom-up” method has the particle size increased. Techniques such as self-assembly and self-organization of molecules, supercritical-fluids, coacervation, inclusion complexation and nanoprecipitation are considered bottom-up methods, while emulsification is a top-down approach. In some cases, both approaches can be combined to yield optimal results. This classification is not used currently [
