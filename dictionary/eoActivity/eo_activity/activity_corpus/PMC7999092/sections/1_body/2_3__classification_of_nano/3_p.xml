<p>A variety of nanoencapsulation processes for food BACs or nutraceuticals have been performed in the last years. For instance, methods resembling nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), nanoemulsions, nanosuspensions, nanoliposomes, biopolymer nanoparticles (NPs) or micelles made of polysaccharides and/or proteins have been developed [

 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] described the liquid-based processes (nanoprecipitation), emulsificationâ€“solvent evaporation, coacervation, ionotropic gelation, supercritical fluid extraction of emulsion (O/W) and electrochemical-based techniques (electrospinning and electrospraying) as suitable techniques for nanoencapsulation.
