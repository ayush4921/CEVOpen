<p>Another suitable method for the generation of steady nanosized particles is ionic gelation, a simple, mild and solvent-free technique. This alternative approach consists of the interaction between positively charged polymers, as chitosan and polyanions. This results with the formation of inter- and intramolecular cross-linkages without employing toxic agents or high temperatures [

 <xref rid="B37-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], as earlier known as ion-induced gelation, leads to NPs and microparticles with some shortcomings. These include inappropriate surface morphology, high dispersibility index, delicate particulate mechanism and absence of proper surface modification spaces to connect functional moieties.
