<p>Micelles have been applied to raise the solubility of bioactive components, such as vitamins, enzymes, β-carotene, soy isoflavones or ω-3 fatty acids. A nanotechnology-based carrier system containing 30 nm micelles was created by a German company Aquanova (Darmstadt, Germany) to encapsulate bioactive substances. The nanoscale carrier system, called NovaSol
 <sup>®</sup>, improves the bioavailability and potency of the target compounds [

In the meantime, the development of nanoliposomes has been described as interesting for food technologists due to the attractive opportunities it offers in a variety of areas (encapsulation, controlled release, increased stability and bioavailability). Nanoliposomes were applied in the food industry to provide flavors and, lately, their capacity has been examined to integrate nutraceuticals, nutrients, enzymes or food additives and food antimicrobials [
