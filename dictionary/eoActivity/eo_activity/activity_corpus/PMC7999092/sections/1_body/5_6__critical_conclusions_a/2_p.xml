<p>Nanoencapsulation-based technologies are unique and current, their operation in both, the food and pharmaceutical areas results in new opportunities for commercialization. In particular, their application involves the production of nanostructured food ingredients, which allow the improvement of the solubility, stability flavor, color and texture of foods during processing and storage. For instance, encapsulation is a valid option to hide unpleasant flavors or aromas. Additionally, it increases the bioavailability and controlled release of the different nutrients in food (protecting bioactive target compounds from light, oxygen or pH variations) while at the same time volatility of encapsulated compounds decreases. Therefore, food businesses can benefit from incorporating NPs to their novel food and beverage products [

Moreover, it is necessary to establish the interactions between the bioactive ingredients and the multiple encapsulating carriers in food systems.
