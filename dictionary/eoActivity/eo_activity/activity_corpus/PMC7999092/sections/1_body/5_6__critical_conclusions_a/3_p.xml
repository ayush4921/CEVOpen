<p>Since a great variety of novel materials are continuously added to foods, many countries established substantial scientific platforms to control food safety and provide risk assessments [

It should be clear that there is still limited data on the toxicological repercussions and ethical issues of nanomaterials, so they must be rigorously tested before being commercialized. This should be done by appropriate in vivo models, which will allow the establishment of legal regulations to protect consumersâ€™ safety [

From another point of view, nanotechnology can also play a notable role in the development of programmable food, an original futuristic concept that promise consumers to obtain their food with the desired nutritional, color, flavor and texture characteristics [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Overall, there is an optimistic attitude and perspective to fully implement and introduce nanoencapsulation in the food industry, which seems to expand in near future and improve the standard of living of the people.
