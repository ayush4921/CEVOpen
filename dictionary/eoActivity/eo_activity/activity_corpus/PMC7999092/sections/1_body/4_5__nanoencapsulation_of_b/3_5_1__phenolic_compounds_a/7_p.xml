<p>Novel synergistic formulation based on the combination of linalool, methyl cinnamate and thymol has been developed applying low molecular weight chitosan dissolved in acetic acid solution. These compounds, known by their strong antimicrobial activity, are the major BACs of the essential oils obtained from the aromatic plants 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum alatum</italic>, 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> and 
 <italic>Cananga odorata</italic>. The nanoencapsulated formulation, characterized by an EE of 35–40% and a loading efficiency 6–7%, showed remarkable antifungal and anti-aflatoxin B1 protection both in vitro and in a food system (
 <italic>Pennisetum glaucum</italic>) without affecting the sensory properties [

 <xref rid="B8-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The obtained results are promising for the encapsulation of hydrophilic nutraceuticals. The delivery systems, dependent on pH, were characterized by a spherical shape and large amount of EE (85%).
