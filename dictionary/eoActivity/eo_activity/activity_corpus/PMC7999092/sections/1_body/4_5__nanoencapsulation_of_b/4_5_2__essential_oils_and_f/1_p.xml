<p>Plant essential oils (EOs) have notable antimicrobial efficacy; hence they are promising alternative for synthetic additives [

 <xref rid="B99-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>] described EOs as volatile plant secondary metabolites that have already been extensively used in medicine, cosmetics and food industry for their antimicrobial, antifungal and antioxidant activity. However, their application is still not completely effective due to some drawbacks (low water solubility, bioavailability, volatility and stability in the foods). The progress made in nanotechnology in recent years allows one to address these obstacles for use of EOs as preservatives.
