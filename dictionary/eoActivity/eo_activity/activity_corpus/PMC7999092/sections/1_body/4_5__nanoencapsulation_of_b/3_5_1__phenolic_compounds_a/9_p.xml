<p>Total phenolics and anthocyanins from blueberry pomace were recently encapsulated after successfully developing a food-grade water-in-oil-in-water or double nanoemulsion system. Particularly, the influence of critical physical parameters (homogenization pressure, stirring speed and time) on the characteristics of double emulsions was evaluated [

The authors found that particle size, size dispersity, ZP and EE greatly impact the stability and functional performance of nanoemulsions (e.g., appearance, texture and bioavailability) and of the final products in which they are used [

 <xref rid="B7-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] nanoencapsulated resveratrol (a naturally occurring polyphenolic compound from the stilbenes family, mainly found in peanuts and grape skins) in trimethyl chitosan NPs cross-linked with tripolyphosphate and/or alginate to acquire controlled release and improved cellular uptake. The combination of both materials with alginate showed higher particle size (575 nm) and EE (56.9%), better distribution (0.339), and the effective controlled release of bioactive materials from chitosan NPs, probably due to the high molecular weight and viscous property of alginate.
