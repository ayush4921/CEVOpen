<p>Bezerra et al. [
 <xref rid="B92-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>] evaluated the use of yellow passion fruit albedo flour, with important pectin content, as encapsulating component for the development of nanodispersions of carotenoid extract from 
 <italic>Spirulina</italic> sp. LEB 18. Nanodispersions were characterized for their stability, antioxidant capacity, physicochemical features and retention of carotenoids after 60 days of storage at 4 Â°C. Concluding remark identified flour as a natural alternative to commercial polymers, containing the possibility of their introduction into several food formulations.
