<p>Polyphenols comprise a considerable diverse group of molecules, which include phenolic acids, flavonoids and many others. They have gained great interest in food production from both, society and industry. These compounds are widely recognized for their antioxidant capacity and interesting health benefits, including anti-inflammatory effects and the prevention of diet-related chronic disorders such as cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, type 2 diabetes and some cancers [
