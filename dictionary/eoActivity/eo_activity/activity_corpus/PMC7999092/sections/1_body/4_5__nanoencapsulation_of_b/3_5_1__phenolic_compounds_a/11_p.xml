<p>In this regard, dos Santos et al. [
 <xref rid="B95-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>] described a series of carotenoids delivery systems and the application of different techniques to determine the parameters that could restrict the effective use of nanoencapsulation technology in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food industry. NPs obtained from tomato carotenoid lycopene have been prepared and accepted as GRAS and were currently used as a food additive. They can be incorporated in baking products and in soft drinks to provide not only color, but also to promote health benefits [

It has been reported that tomato coproducts represent a valuable source for the extraction of potential natural food colorants, antioxidants or supplements with a variety of health benefits. However, as already mentioned, it is not easy to integrate carotenoids into various products due to their inherent instability. Hence, a novel study performed by Horuz and Belibağlı [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] evaluated the use of an electrospinning technique for the nanoencapsulation of carotenoids isolated from tomato peel into zein nanofibers to increase their antioxidant capacity and stability, showing the possibility of its promising use in food processing.
