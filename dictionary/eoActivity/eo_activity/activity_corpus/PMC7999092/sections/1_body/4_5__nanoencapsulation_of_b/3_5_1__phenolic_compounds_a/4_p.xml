<p>Another compound, with increased scientific and industrial interest, is aspalathin that exerts particular capacity to improve glucose and lipid metabolism. This substance can be found in high amounts in 
 <italic>Aspalathus linearis</italic>, traditionally used for the production of rooibos tea. Nevertheless, similar to curcumin, aspalathin has poor bioavailability and peculiar structure that limits its intestinal absorption with high sensitivity to oxidation. For this reason, Human et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] investigated the production of NPs of aspalathin by electrospraying using both natural (chitosan and lecithin) and synthetic biodegradable esters (poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and Eudragit S100
 <sup>®</sup> (methacrylate acid copolymer, ES100) polymers, comparing the results with those found with conventional methods. The most favorable NPs characteristics were obtained using synthetic polymers and electrospraying method (55.4% and 50.8% vs. 1.6% and 1.2% for ES100 and PLGA in electrospraying and conventional methods, respectively). On the contrary, natural polymers reflected higher efficiency with conventional methods (31.1% and 86.8% vs. 4.4% and 74.4% for chitosan and lecithin, respectively). To sum up, high EE (55.4%) and LC (12.7%), small particle size (189.9 nm), high ZP (−44.3 mV) and a controlled slow-release profile were shown by ES100.
