<p>Furthermore, a recent study evaluates the possibility of encapsulating fish oil with high content in Ï‰-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in lecithin-oil mixture nanoliposomes. The aim was to evaluate its influence on the technological and sensory quality of fortified bread, since this oil is characterized by strong odor and easy oxidation. The results revealed that nanoencapsulation of fish oil exerted higher resistance to lipid oxidation and its incorporation into bread had no negative effects on both textural and sensory quality [
