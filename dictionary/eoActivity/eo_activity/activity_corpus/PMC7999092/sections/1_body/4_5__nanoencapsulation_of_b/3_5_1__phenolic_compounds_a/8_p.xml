<p>Currently, other delivery systems for phenolic compounds are being developed. In this regard, lipid NPs such as nanoemulsions, nanoliposomes, solid lipid NPs (SLN) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) have been used in the food industry. For instance, nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) have been used and optimized by response-surface methodology to protect BACs from

The impact of the emerging technology used for the extraction of phenolic compounds, microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) or pressurized liquid extraction (PLE), lipid and surfactant concentration on the average NPS, PDI and ZP were evaluated. MAE-NLC resulted in EE of 52.9 and 60% for quercetin and anthocyanins, respectively, and NPs characterized by a mean size of 470 ± 8 nm, PDI of 0.47 and ZP of −26.3 mV. These NPs retained 55% of total phenolic compounds (TPC), while PLE-NLC NPs resulted in higher retentions (73%) and EE (93 and 84% for quercetin and anthocyanins, respectively) with a lower NPs size and PDI but higher ZP (344 nm, 0.34 and −25.7 mV, respectively). These NLC showed additional favorable attributes compared to those found in other NPs, such as more loading capacity and longer physicochemical stability, due to the combination of solid and liquid lipids forming their matrix [
