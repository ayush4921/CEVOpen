<p>Regarding the development of functional foods, Tang et al. [
 <xref rid="B84-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>] used chitosan and poly (Î³-glutamic acid) to produce nanostructures for oral delivery of tea catechins, which can be applied as food additives for drinks, foods and dietary supplements. These polyphenolic bioactives are responsible for most of the favorable health effects (antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, anticarcinogenic or antihypertensive) of green tea extracts [
 <xref rid="B85-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. However, their bioefficacy will depend on their bioavailability [
 <xref rid="B86-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. This complex process, which involves several phases (liberation, absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination) is relatively poor for catechins [
 <xref rid="B87-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Puligundla et al. [
 <xref rid="B87-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] discussed the advances related to improvement of in vitro and in vivo bioavailability of green tea polyphenols using nanotechnology approaches. The nanoencapsulation in the form of biopolymer-based NPs, is the most popular approach to enhance their intestinal permeability and absorption. In addition, nanoencapsulation would also avoid the potential antinutritional properties of tea polyphenols.
