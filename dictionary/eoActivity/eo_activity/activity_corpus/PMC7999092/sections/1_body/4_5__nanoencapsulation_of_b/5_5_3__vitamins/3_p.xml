<p>Chapeau et al. [
 <xref rid="B102-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>] investigated coassembly to bind lactoglobulin and lactoferrin as biocarriers of the vitamin B9, and concluded that natural food components have an important potential as carriers of functional ingredients. Other natural carrier materials are alginate and chitosan that were used by Azevedo et al. [
 <xref rid="B103-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>] for developing vitamin B2 NPs. Riboflavin was also encapsulated in food-grade water/oil/water double emulsions with a variety of lipid sources (chia oil, sunflower oil, olive oil or rendered pork backfat).
