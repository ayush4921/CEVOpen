<p>Carotenoids are important phytonutrients, essential for the health since humans are unable to synthesize them in their bodies. These compounds are interesting functional ingredients in the human diet that also can be used as coloring agents in processing. Therefore, in addition to their immense importance in photosynthetic organisms as natural pigments, they are considered as valuable health-promotional compounds. Nevertheless, they are susceptible to environmental and processing stress while having low bioavailability and water solubility. Changes of their chemical structure are prone to influence of pH, light, oxygen and heat, limiting their pharmaceutical/food exploitation [

In this context, nanotechnology through lipid-based nanodelivery structures (nanoemulsions, nanoliposomes or surfactant-based nanocarriers and SLN) offered safe and positive options for the entrapment of carotenoids. As a result, an efficient controlled release is obtained, which would allow the expansion of its industrial applicability [
