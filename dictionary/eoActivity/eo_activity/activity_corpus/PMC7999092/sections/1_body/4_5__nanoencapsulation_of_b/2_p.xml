<p>In this sense, nanoencapsulation could be an encouraging method for shielding many food constituents against certain physiological circumstances or degradation with masking some types of unpleasant odors and tastes [

Reducing the particle size of BACs may enhance their stability, bioavailability, solubility and delivery, thus promoting their functional activity. In fact, nanotechnology has already been successfully used to solubilize and disperse lipophilic components in water and fruit beverages (carotenoids, phytosterols and antioxidants). In addition, nanoencapsulation can control the release of active ingredients (phenolic compounds, proteins, enzymes, vitamins, minerals and others) and improve the characteristics of the final food product [
