<p>Another attractive trend reported by Alfadul and Elneshwy [
 <xref rid="B111-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>] is the nanoencapsulation of live probiotic microbes for the promotion of gastrointestinal health. They can be incorporated into different food and drink products, including fermented milk, cheese, yoghurt and fruit-based drinks. Particularly, the main genera of probiotic microorganisms preferred by the food industry are 
 <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> and 
 <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic>. However, the application of probiotics in food products is not an easy procedure, since several of these microorganisms might lose their viability before consumption (during processing and storage) or during digestion [

 <sup>6</sup> CFU/g of intestinal content of probiotic bacteria are present in the final food product [
