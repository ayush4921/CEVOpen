<p>The nanoencapsulation of saffron hydrophilic apocarotenoids, as crocins and picrocrocin, using maltodextrin and spray-drying was also reported. The production and the characterization of the product stability were evaluated in the study by examining the influence of size and core: wall ratio on the product yield and the EE. Three were the core: wall weight ratios, 1:5, 1:10 and 1:20 (
 <italic>w/w</italic>) evaluated. The effect of the core: wall ratio on EE was similar for crocins and picrocrocin. Thus, as the ratio increases, there is a decrease in EE (≅54% vs. ≅80% and ≅56% vs. ≅82% in crocins and picrocrocin for 1:5 and 1:20, respectively). This behavior could be related to the fact that a thin layer of wall material is formed when a higher ratio is used due to the low content of wall material in the initial feed solution [
