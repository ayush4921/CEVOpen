<p>The possible carrier agents for low doses of EOs are researched by industries in order to improve the quality of their final products. Actually, many applicable methods have been developed to encapsulate EOs and improve their stability [

Furthermore, essential and fish oils can exert unpleasant flavors, which limits their direct inclusion into food formulations, due to their negative impact on the sensory quality. In this sense, nanoencapsulation is useful for masking unwanted flavors [
