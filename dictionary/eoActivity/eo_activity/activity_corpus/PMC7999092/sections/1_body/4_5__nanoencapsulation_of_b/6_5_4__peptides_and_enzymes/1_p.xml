<p>There were not many studies about the nanoencapsulation of peptides and enzymes. Maherani et al. [
 <xref rid="B107-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>] successfully encapsulated natural dipeptide antioxidants in nanoliposomes, while Wen et al. [
 <xref rid="B108-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>] applied liposomes in the oral delivery of enzymes, proteins, flavors and antimicrobial substances. In one study, two-fold reduction for cheese elaboration was possible through the entrapment of proteolytic enzymes into liposomes without affecting texture and flavor [

 <xref rid="B77-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Free nisin served as a control while encapsulated nisin demonstrated better inhibitory properties in milk and cheese at refrigeration temperatures [
 <xref rid="B109-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. Likewise, Janes et al. [
 <xref rid="B110-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>] developed chitosan NPs of polypeptides, observing that the prepared particles presented improved uptake through mucosal cells.
