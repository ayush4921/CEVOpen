<p>Nanoencapsulation can protect many vitamins against a wide range of conditions and substances that could otherwise affect their integrity during food processing. As an example, David and Livney [
 <xref rid="B83-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>] used potato proteins as a natural material to protect and deliver vitamin D3 (VD) in beverages. VD-potato protein nanocomplexes had better results regarding the shelf life of the samples with reduced loss of vitamins. In addition, Abbasi et al. [
 <xref rid="B101-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>] encapsulated VD by whey protein isolates NPs and evaluated its stability for 7 days in the presence of air. They observed higher content of vitamin D in NPs than in control sample.
