<p>In respect of the technological application, a recent study evaluated the use of whey protein wall system to nanoencapsulate roasted coffee bean oil through nanospray drying process [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This product is considered as a substantial by-product obtained from the coffee industry, which is commonly used as flavor ingredient in food products. However, coffee oil is highly susceptible to oxidation with the consequent formation of undesirable flavors. Therefore, its use in nanoemulsion form would allow to improve its stability and to protect coffee oil constituents, probably related to the emulsifying properties of whey protein isolate and the lower oil-to-wall ratio used. Ghasemi et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] studied the encapsulation of orange peel oil by pectin–whey–protein nanocomplexes. This oil is a valued flavoring agent in the food industry, but it is volatile under environmental conditions. Thus, applying nanoencapsulation technology by complexation method, where the core substance is protected with a complex of two different biopolymers, is optimal way to preserve and control the release of the oil.
