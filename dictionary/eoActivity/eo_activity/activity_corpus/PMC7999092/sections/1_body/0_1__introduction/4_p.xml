<p>The process of encapsulation is based on enclosing a bioactive compound in liquid, solid or gaseous states within a matrix or inert material, usually a polymer. An enclosed wall can preserve the coated substance (food or flavor molecules/ingredients), increasing its stability in the corresponding environment. Encapsulation can promote greater stability of bioactives in foods with improved regulation of their release at the active physiological place [

 <xref rid="B2-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], the encapsulated particles can be classified as nanocapsules (&lt;0.2 μm), microcapsules (0.2–5000 μm) and macrocapsules (&gt;5000 μm). One of the main benefits of applying nanoencapsulation is the homogeneity it imparts, resulting in better encapsulation efficiency and suitable physical and chemical properties. This process is an appealing alternative for the redesign of functional food components that can strongly influence the processability, bioavailability and stability of products [
