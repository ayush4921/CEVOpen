<p>In food science, nanotechnology is an emerging area that is important for the future industrial productions, where newly developed properties from the particle reduction will probably provide improved sensory properties of foods (e.g., color, taste and texture). In addition, nanosubstances could be suitable for food protection while extending the storage [

 <xref rid="B5-molecules-26-01547" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], this technology offers new applications such as food packaging and the design of delivery systems for bioactive compounds (BACs). For this purpose, functional nanocapsules are developed with the aid of surfactants, reverse micelles and emulsion layers [
