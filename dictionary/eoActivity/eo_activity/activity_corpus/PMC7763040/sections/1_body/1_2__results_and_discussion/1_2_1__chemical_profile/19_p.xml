<p>Karik et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-05826" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] reported the EO composition of 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> collected in Turkey. The most abundant oxygenated monoterpene was β-thujone (34.59%), followed by α-thujone (12.60%) and camphor (10.09%). A great variability was found in 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> grown in northern India [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-25-05826" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Indeed, the most abundant compounds were cis-thujone (19.8–42.5%), (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene (1.2–16.1%), manool (3.6–15.1%), viridiflorol (3.1–12.8%), 1,8-cineole (2.8–13.8%), and camphor (1.4–22.1%).
