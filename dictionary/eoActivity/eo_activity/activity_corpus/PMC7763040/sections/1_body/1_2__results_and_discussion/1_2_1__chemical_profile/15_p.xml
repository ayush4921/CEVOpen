<p>Russo et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-25-05826" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] confirmed that the variability in EOs constituents depending on environmental factors such as altitude, water availability, and pedoclimatic conditions, analyzing eighteen EOs from 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> collected in Molise (Italy) in three different climatic macroenvironments such as lowland, low hill, and high hill. Results showed that the main components for all investigated oils are α-thujone (7.8–20.1%), camphor (8.4–20.8%), borneol (2.5–16.9%), γ-muurolene (2.9–13.8%), and sclareol (5.9–23.1%). These compounds are common constituents of the essential oil from 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> leaves, but present with different percentages depending on sampling techniques, geographic origin, environmental factors, season, extraction methods, and genetic differences.
