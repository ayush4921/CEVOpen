<p>In our analysis, β-thujone was combined to β-pinene (CR group) and to α-thujone and viridiflor (AB and few samples from MO and SE), whereas all other compounds were diversely combined in a group where it was difficult to find a clear limit between two subgroups. Calabrian populations were grouped together with a subgroup from AL for a combination in camphor, camphene, and bornyl acetate that has not been identified in other studies.</p>
