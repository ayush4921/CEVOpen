 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> (sage) is characterized by a rather high level of genetic diversity in the plastid genome as well as at the nuclear DNA level [

 <xref rid="B7-molecules-25-05826" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-25-05826" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Spatial analysis of the genetic diversity of 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> in Balkan peninsula revealed a typical pattern of isolation by distance, indicating that presumably 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> survived in microrefugia and expanded from there resulting in secondary contact zones [
