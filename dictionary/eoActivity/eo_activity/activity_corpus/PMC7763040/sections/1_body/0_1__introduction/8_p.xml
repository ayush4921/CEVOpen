<p>Several studies reported chemical analyses of its phytochemicals including essential oil, which is acknowledged worldwide because of its beneficial properties. However, it is important to take into account that the relative quantities and the presence and/or absence of some constituents are strongly affected by environmental conditions and agronomic management practices including plant genetic, elevation, topography, harvest time, as well as ecological and climatic conditions. For these reasons, essential oils (EOs) from plants collected in different countries at different seasons comprise different chemical compounds and may exert different biological effects [

The antioxidant activity of aromatic plants has been widely explored and found to have health applications in prevention and reducing risk of diseases such as Alzheimer’s diseases (AD). This neurodegenerative disorder is the most common form of dementia, often characterized by cognitive decline and memory impairment that can affect behaviour, speech, the motor system, and orientation [

During AD progression, different types of neurons deteriorate, although there is a profound loss of forebrain cholinergic neurons, which is accompanied by a progressive decline in acetylcholine [
