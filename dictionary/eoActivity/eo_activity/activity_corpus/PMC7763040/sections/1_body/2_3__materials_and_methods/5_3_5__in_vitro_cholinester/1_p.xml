<p>AChE and BChE inhibitory properties of 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> EOs were evaluated by applying the Ellmanâ€™s method as previously reported [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-25-05826" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. AChE from 
 <italic>Electrophorus electricus</italic> (EC 3.1.1.7, Type VI-S) and BChE from equine serum (EC 3.1.1.8) were used. Acetylthiocholine iodide and butyrylthiocholine iodide were employed as the reaction substrates. Physostigmine was the positive control. The absorbance was read at 405 nm.
