<p>Four in vitro tests, namely, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), ferric-reducing ability power (FRAP), and β-carotene bleaching assays, were used to assess the antioxidant effects of 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> essential oils as previously described [
 <xref rid="B61-molecules-25-05826" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. DPPH and ABTS tests were applied to examine the radicals scavenging effects of sage essential oils. In DPPH assay, samples were tested at different concentrations in the range of 62.5–1000 μg/mL. Absorbance was measured at 517 nm and ascorbic acid was used as positive control. In ABTS assay, samples were analyzed at concentrations ranging from 1 to 400 μg/mL. The absorbance was read at 734 nm. Ascorbic acid was used as positive control.
