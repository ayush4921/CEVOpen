<p>In conclusion, in this work, three sage EOs (S1â€“S3) from Southern Italy (Calabria) were chemically and biologically investigated. The interest in these species is due to the fact that Southern Italian populations are at the South-West border of the distribution area of the species, representing possible differentiated populations inside the species variability.</p>
