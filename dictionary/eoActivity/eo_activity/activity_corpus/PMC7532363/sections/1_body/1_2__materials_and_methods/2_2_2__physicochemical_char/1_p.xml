<p>Physicochemical characterization of babassu oil was determined according to the Instituto Adolf Lutz [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] as follows: relative density was measured using a 10 mL pycnometer at 25°C; refraction index was determined using a Abbé refractometer at 40°C; acid values were determined by titration with KOH 0.1 M; peroxide values were calculated from the iodine release from potassium iodide; while the lipid oxidation (rancidity) was determined by Kreis reaction using phloroglucinol in acid medium.
