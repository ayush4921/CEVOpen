<p>Ear edema induced by multiple applications of croton oil was used to assess the topical anti-inflammatory of babassu oil. Shortly, mice received 20 
 <italic>µ</italic>L of a 5% croton oil in acetone on both ears on alternate days for 9 days. From day 5, mice were treated topically with 10 
 <italic>µ</italic>L/ear of acetone or babassu oil twice a day. Positive control received 0.1 mg/ear of dexamethasone dissolved in acetone. On the 9
 <sup>th</sup> day, 6 h after the administration of croton oil, mice were euthanized, and 6 mm diameter samples were collected from each ear using a biopsy punch. Both samples were weighed for the determination of edema.
