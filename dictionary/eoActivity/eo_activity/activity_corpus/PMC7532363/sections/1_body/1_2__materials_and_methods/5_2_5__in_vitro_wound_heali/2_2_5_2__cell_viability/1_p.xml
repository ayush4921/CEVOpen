<p>The effect of babassu oil on L929 cell viability was determined by the method of 3-(4, 5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2, 5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT). Firstly, L929 cells (3 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/mL) were plated in 96-well tissue culture plates for 24 h. Then, babassu oil (100–1.56 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL) was added to the wells, and the cells were incubated for 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h. DMSO 0.5% was used as control. After each interval, 25 
 <italic>µ</italic>L of MTT solution (5 mg/mL) was added to the wells, and the plates were incubated for another 3 h. At the end of that period, the supernatant was aspirated and 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of DMSO was added in each well for the dissolution of the formazan crystals. The absorbance was measured at 560 nm in a microplate reader. Babassu oil was tested in triplicate in three independent experiments.
