<p>The scratch assay was used to evaluate the effect of babassu oil on the migration of L929 fibroblasts. Briefly, L929 cells (2 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/mL) were plated in 24-well tissue culture plates for 24 h to reach confluence. Cell monolayers were scratched using a sterile 200 
 <italic>µ</italic>L pipette tip to produce a wounded area with 1,2001,500 
 <italic>µ</italic>m width. Then, the wells were washed with fresh medium without FBS to remove any unattached cells. Babassu oil (1.56, 3.12, and 6.25 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL) and 10% FBS, used as positive control, were added to the wells in triplicate. Cell migration was measured each 6 h using an inverted microscope Novel XD202 under 40x magnification [
