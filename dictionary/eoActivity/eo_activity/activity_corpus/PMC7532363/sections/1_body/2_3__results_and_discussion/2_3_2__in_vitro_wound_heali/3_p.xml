<p>Since inflammation plays an essential role in wound healing and chronification, LPS-stimulated peritoneal macrophages were used to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity of babassu oil in vitro (
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Babassu oil inhibited the production of NO by macrophages, which could be beneficial in the healing process since NO is an important chemoattractant during the initial inflammatory phase, with iNOS expression peaking until 48h of wounding [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Increased NO level induces keratinocyte apoptosis, while the proper modulation of NO is crucial for the postwounding angiogenesis [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Deakin et al. [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] showed that NO inhibition increases IL-6 levels in LPS-stimulated macrophages. IL-6 plays a vital role in all wound healing phases, including proliferation and remodeling phases, and not only in the inflammatory phase [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, an excess of IL-6 signaling may lead to keloid scarring [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Babassu oil also increased the levels of IFN-
 <italic>γ</italic> and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, both known for enhancing wound healing. Treatment with IFN-
 <italic>γ</italic> results in faster restoration of tissue integrity in both full-thickness incision skin wound models [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> plays a dual effect in wound macrophages; in the early phase, it induces M1-phenotype through NF-k
 <italic>B</italic> signaling to promote host defense, while in the later phase, it induces M2-phenotype through INF-
 <italic>γ</italic> signaling to promote resolution and healing [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Membrane-bound TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> is responsible for neutrophil apoptosis induced by wound macrophages, decreasing the oxidative stress in the wound bed [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Another cytokine modulated by babassu oil was IL-2, which reduces inflammation in the wounds and prevents over deposition of extracellular matrix, preventing aberrant wounds [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This result set incited us to further evaluate the in vivo wound healing effects of babassu oil.
