<p>Nevin and Rajamohan [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] showed that coconut oil was able to accelerate wound healing in rats, increasing the collagen deposition and limiting oxidative stress in the wound tissue. The authors attributed the effect to the presence of medium-chain fatty acids (C:6 to C:12) and also to minor compounds found in the nonsaponifiable fraction of the oil, such as polyphenols, vitamin E, and provitamin A. Both major fatty acids found in babassu oil and lauric and oleic acids have been reported to positively affect wound healing. Lauric acid and its monoglyceride are known for their antimicrobial properties, which could maintain the wound bed's necessary sterility for the healing process [

 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] described a proinflammatory effect of oleic acid topical administration on rat skin wounds on the first days, which may speed up the healing process. This result agrees with the increase in inflammatory cells in the wounds treated with babassu oil and Dersani (
