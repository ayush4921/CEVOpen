<p>Macroscopically, babassu oil decreased the erythema on the third day and the scab formation in the 14
 <sup>th</sup> day after wounding. At the same time, it increased the reepithelization at the end of the experiment (

 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). In the histomorphometric analysis, babassu oil increased neutrophil infiltration on the 3
 <sup>rd</sup> day, decreasing the mononuclear infiltration after 7 and 14 days. It stimulated the blood vessels formation at all periods analyzed and increased the count of fibroblasts and collagen deposition after 7 and 14 days (
