<p>In conclusion, babassu oil stimulates L929 fibroblasts migration and modulates the inflammatory response induced by LPS in mice peritoneal macrophages. 
 <italic>In vivo</italic>, babassu oil was able to accelerate the healing process in a full-thickness splinted wound model due to an increase in the fibroblasts number, blood vessels, and collagen deposition in the wounds. The babassu oil also increased the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the wound site and showed an anti-inflammatory effect in a chronic ear edema model, reducing the ear thickness, epidermal hyperplasia, and myeloperoxidase activity. Thus, these data corroborate the use of babassu oil in folk medicine as a remedy to treat skin wounds.
