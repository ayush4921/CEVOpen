<p>Essential oils (EOs) from aromatic and medicinal plants display a wide range of biological properties, namely antibacterial, antifungal, and antioxidant [

 <xref rid="B3-molecules-26-02342" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-26-02342" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], thus being good candidates as food preservatives [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-26-02342" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The EOs’ antioxidant properties may be linked to the interaction with bacterial/fungal metabolism, which can cause oxidative spoilage (indirect antioxidant activity), and/or to the delay of lipid oxidation through the scavenging of formed free radicals (direct antioxidant activity) [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-26-02342" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Their direct antioxidant activity has been mainly associated with the presence of chain-breaking antioxidants such as the phenols carvacrol, eugenol (Eug), or thymol [

 <xref rid="B7-molecules-26-02342" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Certain terpenoids, namely α-/γ- terpinene, α-phellandrene, etc., can also contribute by enhancing the free radical termination reactions (radical-radical coupling) [
