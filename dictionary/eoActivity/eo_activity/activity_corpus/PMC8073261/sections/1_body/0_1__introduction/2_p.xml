<p>The wide use of herbs and spices rich in EOs is an integral part of the Mediterranean diet [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-26-02342" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Among them, there are some, either native Mediterranean (oregano, thyme) or non-native (clove) plants, the EOs of which are highly effective preservatives with significant radical scavenging potential owing to their abundance in phenolic compounds [

 <xref rid="B13-molecules-26-02342" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The EO obtained from bay laurel (
 <italic>Laurus nobilis</italic> L.), an evergreen tree or shrub native to southern Europe that is used not only as a flavoring agent in various dishes, food, and beverage preparations but also for its preservative properties [

 <xref rid="B16-molecules-26-02342" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], is characterized by a low content of phenolic type antioxidants. This leads to the hypothesis for a poor contribution to the EO preservative properties through a direct antioxidant activity mechanism. Specifically, this EO has been reported to contain only Eug in a concentration ranging from traces up to ~12.0% [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-26-02342" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This phenol is much more active than other compounds reported to be present in abundance such as 1,8-cineole (typically, the major one), linalool, γ-terpinene, and ϐ-pinene [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-02342" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Except for the aforementioned constituents, the EO contains also methyl eugenol (MEug), which is formed from Eug due to the activity of certain enzymes (e.g., 
 <italic>O</italic>-methyltransferase) [

 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-02342" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This compound, usually detected at a higher concentration than Eug [

 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-02342" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], is a limiting factor for the use of bay laurel EO in food applications [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-02342" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] due to its toxicity [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-02342" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Although it lacks a free -OH moiety in the aromatic ring, some experimental data indicate that it presents radical scavenging activity [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-26-02342" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-02342" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-02342" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Taking into consideration the above, in the present study, the radical scavenging potential of the two compounds was first examined theoretically via calculation of appropriate molecular indices widely used to characterize chain-breaking antioxidants [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-26-02342" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Calculations were carried out in the gas and liquid phases aiming at approximating the activity in a solution (methanol and water) or bulk oils (
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane) and membrane lipids (
 <italic>n</italic>-octanol). For mechanistic purposes, other related compounds were also studied. Then, with the purpose to test experimentally the theoretical suggestions and hypothesis, the DPPH
 <sup>•</sup> assay was applied to MEug, Eug, other main components (1,8-cineole, linalool, α-pinene), as well as to a set of chemically characterized with GC-MS/GC-FID bay laurel EOs. Our work aimed at contributing to the ongoing research on bay laurel EO as a source of multifunctional constituents for food and pharmaceutical applications.
