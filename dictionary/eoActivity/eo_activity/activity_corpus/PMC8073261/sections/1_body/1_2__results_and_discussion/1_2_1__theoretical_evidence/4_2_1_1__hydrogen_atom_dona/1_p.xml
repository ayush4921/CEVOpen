<p>As shown, based on the gas-phase BDE values presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02342-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, it was evident that MEug, though lacking an -O-H group in the aromatic ring, could act as a hydrogen atom donor through the abstraction of an allyl hydrogen atom located in the side chain. The computed BDE value for the corresponding C-H bond (72.7 kcal/mol) was low, as a consequence of the influence of the aromatic ring and the double bond at the end of the side chain. The value was almost the same as that for the equivalent bond in Eug (72.3 kcal/mol) showing that it was not influenced by the substitution pattern in the aromatic ring. This was further verified by the -C-H BDE value calculated for Est (72.5 kcal/mol) lacking an -O-H (Eug) at C-4 or an -OCH
 <sub>3</sub> (MEug) substituent at 
 <italic>o</italic>-position and the published BDE values for Est and Eug in the liquid phase (72.7 and 72.8 kcal/mol, respectively) [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-02342" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Lower BDE value by 10.1 kcal/mol of the C-H bond to that of the O-H one in Eug suggests that the compound should preferentially donate first a hydrogen atom from the side chain. A similar observation has been already made theoretically in the past by other authors who reported a lower difference in the corresponding BDE values (6â€“8.6 kcal/mol) in the gas or liquid phase [

 <xref rid="B33-molecules-26-02342" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The donation of the hydrogen atom from the -O-H group can follow during sequential HAT. Such a donation should be much easier as the BDE value becomes significantly lower (66.6 kcal/mol) due to the formation of a fully conjugated compound that is very stable (
