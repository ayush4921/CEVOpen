<p>The latter surprisingly was not completely planar as the end of the side chain deviated by 32.5 Ǻ. Nevertheless, this seems to be the most stable structure as the repeating of the optimization process using an input with a complete planar structure resulted in the same structure depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02342-f002">Figure 2</xref>. Such a finding was different from that reported for a catechol derivative, namely dihydro-caffeic acid, for which it was shown computationally in the gas phase that the allyl hydrogen atom could only be abstracted after the formation of an
