<p>Next, experimental evidence was sought for bay laurel EOs. The DPPH
 <sup>•</sup> scavenging activity expressed as Trolox or α-tocopherol equivalents, and the % concentration of the most abundant components identified are given in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02342-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. The EOs differed in the concentration of 1,8-cineole widely (34.1–63.0%), which is in line with what has been previously reported for this constituent [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-26-02342" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-02342" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Similarly, the EOs differed in their percent composition in MEug, Eug, and their ratio, which is also backed by the literature [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-02342" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Considering that traceability is an issue in commercial EO samples, such composition variations are expected and can be attributed to differences in, among others, the origin of plant material [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-02342" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-26-02342" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], the plant organs used [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-02342" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-26-02342" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-26-02342" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and also to the extraction methods applied [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-26-02342" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The presence of Eug was found to be affirmative for assigning radical scavenging activity to bay laurel EO as evidenced via Pearson correlation analysis between antioxidant activity values and the % concentration values of the EOs’ major constituents. Results show the highest correlation for Eug (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.916, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.000). MEug followed (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.785, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.000), despite the ~270-fold lower activity than that of pure Eug. Other compounds indicated to contribute less were linalool (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.587, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.007) and α-terpinyl acetate (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.484, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.031). Pure linalool, however, was not found active even after 20 h of reaction with the radical upon testing at a high concentration ([linalool]/[DPPH
 <sup>•</sup>], mol/mol = 90). Such an observation is corroborated by the high IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of the compound using the DPPH
 <sup>•</sup> assay and the higher BDE value by ~6.5 kcal/mol compared to that of Eug according to literature data [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-02342" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. α-Pinene, not correlating with the antioxidant activity values, was also found inactive. The same was evidenced for 1,8-cineole, the most abundant EO compound when examined at a high concentration ([1,8-cineole]/[DPPH
 <sup>•</sup>], mol/mol = 90), even after 20 h of reaction monitoring. The lower activity of 1,8-cineole even than that of MEug is in agreement with the work of Ballesteros et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-26-02342" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], who reported a 2-fold lower potency toward the DPPH
 <sup>•</sup> scavenging for the former. The high BDE values computed in the present study in methanol for different C-H bonds (88.0–93.0 kcal/mol) of the compound and, as verified by published data in the aqueous phase [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-02342" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], may justify this finding. The corresponding monoterpenoid, except for being rather inactive, had a negative influence in DPPH
 <sup>•</sup> scavenging activity of the EOs as its levels were negatively correlated (
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.642, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.002) with the Trolox equivalent values. A similar trend to that has been reported by Chrysargyris et al. [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-26-02342" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] upon studying various aromatic and medicinal plants with DPPH
 <sup>•</sup> including a set of laurel EOs. The authors attributed that negative correlation to its low activity. However, such a trend could also be linked to a molecular crowding effect due to the high concentration of 1,8-cineole. As a consequence, the access to the free radical by other active compounds present at lower concentration is hindered [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-26-02342" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], with the effect expected to be more pronounced at higher 1,8-cineole levels of concentration. A multivariate approach (partial least square regression, PLS-R) that takes into account the concomitant contribution of the concentration of EOs’ components to the antioxidant activity values verified the observations made by Pearson correlation for MEug, Eug, and 1,8-cineole via a statistically significant model (
 <italic>F</italic> = 81.71, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.000, 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.956, 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>
 <sub>(prediction)</sub> = 0.820). Thus, the standardized coefficient obtained for Eug was the highest (2.28903), ~8.3-fold higher than that of MEug (0.27670), whereas that of 1,8-cineole was negligible (0.00227).
