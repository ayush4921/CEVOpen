<p>The scavenging activity of the DPPH radical (DPPH
 <sup>•</sup>) by pure MEug was examined comparatively to that of pure Eug in methanol to test experimentally the theoretical findings. The determination of IC
 <sub>50</sub> values showed that MEug had some activity but low (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 80 [MEug]/[DPPH
 <sup>•</sup>], mol/mol) in comparison to that of Eug (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.3 [Eug]/[DPPH
 <sup>•</sup>], mol/mol). This result is in general agreement with that of other publications employing the DPPH
 <sup>•</sup> assay [

 <xref rid="B36-molecules-26-02342" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The magnitude of the reported difference varies (Eug vs. MEug: 1.23-fold up to &gt;21-fold more efficient). Joshi [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-26-02342" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] reported MEug as inactive toward DPPH
 <sup>•</sup>; however, this could be related to both the short monitoring period (20 min) of the reaction and the low [AH]/[DPPH
 <sup>•</sup>] ratio selected upon testing (0.004–0.032). As the C-H BDE values for both MEug and Eug were found to be comparable, and electron donation is expected to have little influence on their activity, the experimental findings for MEug (higher RSA% values when prolonging reaction monitoring to 20 h) indicate that if an allyl hydrogen atom donation takes place, this occurs at a rather slow pace. The observation is further supported by Amorati et al. [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-26-02342" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] who, working on literature data, found that α-tocopherol (O−H BDE value 77.2 kcal/mol) reacted by 10
 <sup>6</sup>-fold faster with DPPH
 <sup>•</sup> than 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C-H BDE value 77.9 kcal/mol). The explanation given by Denison and Denisova [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-26-02342" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] about the reaction of aminyl radicals with the C-H bonds of alkylperoxyl radicals or the O-H bonds of hydroxyperoxyl radicals could account for the aforementioned observations. Specifically, the argument that the reaction with O-H bonds is fast due to “virtually no activation energy”, which is associated with the triplet repulsion in the two reaction centers (C…H…N vs. O…H…N) and the difference in the electronegativities of the interacting atoms. Therefore, despite the lower C-H BDE value in Eug the hydrogen atom donation should be favored due to the presence of the O-H group. The much higher activity should eventually be related to the donation of its allyl hydrogen as well, through a sequential HAT, leading to the formation of the compound depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02342-f002">Figure 2</xref>. The latter suggestion could be supported by the higher RSA% values observed for Eug when prolonging the reaction monitoring from 1 to 20 h.
