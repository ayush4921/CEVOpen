<p>The selection of the 6-31G level was based on past studies for various phenolic compounds [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-26-02342" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. MEug was found non-planar. Although the methoxy group at C-4 in the input was set to be coplanar with the aromatic ring, after optimization, it was found to deviate from the plane by 126.217 Ǻ due to steric crowding. Such a conformation is different than that given by Chowdhry et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-26-02342" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] who, using spectroscopy (IR, Raman) and a different DFT approach, reported that the orientation of the two methoxy groups should be “
 <italic>trans</italic>” to minimize the steric hindrance. Examination of such a conformer with our approach showed that it can co-exist as its gas-phase enthalpy is only higher by 0.04 kcal/mol from the most stable structure we found. The side chain deviated from the plane by 50.16 Ǻ owing to the absence of extended conjugation when compared to iEug, MiEug, and Aneth. Similar observations were made for MEug in the liquid phase, where the corresponding angle was slightly higher (52.07 Ǻ in 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane; 55.01 Ǻ in 
 <italic>n</italic>-octanol; 55.27 Ǻ in methanol; 55.49 Ǻ in water). The value of the dihedral angle formed by the carbon atoms of the side chain (122.29 Ǻ) was in close agreement with that reported in the literature (123.18 Ǻ) using a different computational approach for gas-phase calculations [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-26-02342" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Non-planarity regarding the side chain (50.73 Ǻ) was also found for Eug and in agreement with our past study in the gas phase at 6-31 + G(d) [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-26-02342" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] as well as for Est (51.09 Ǻ). As a consequence, MEug, Eug, and Est are expected to be located in the interphase of systems containing dispersed lipids such as liposomes, which is of high importance considering that it is the main site of oxidation [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-26-02342" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. MEug due to the presence of the second -OCH
 <sub>3</sub> group becomes more lipophilic according to the Log 
 <italic>P</italic> (logarithm of partition coefficient 
 <italic>P</italic>) values (3.21 vs. 2.69) obtained theoretically (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot3-molecules-26-02342">Section 3.3</xref>). This was further supported by the dipole moment values obtained upon single-point energy calculations in the gas (2.1364 D vs. 2.5917 D) or the liquid phase (data not shown).
