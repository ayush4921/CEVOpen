<p>In terms of the corresponding computed values, it was evident that MEug was a less potent electron donor in comparison to the gas-phase study as the ΔIP values were in the range −9.5 to −11.9 kcal/mol, significantly lower than in the former (−25.0 kcal/mol). Contrary to gas-phase calculations, the replacement of an -O-H group by an -OCH
 <sub>3</sub> at C-4 reduced the electron donation activity, as the IP value was higher in all solvents than that of Phe. Introduction of a second -OCH
 <sub>3</sub> in 
 <italic>o</italic>-position did not have a clear positive effect. Thus, in all solvents, MEug was found slightly less active than Eug as the corresponding IP values were higher by 1.9 to 3.1 kcal/mol. The same reverse trend was observed for the pair iEug-MiEug. The finding for Aneth-Est indicating the superiority of the extended conjugation was in line with gas-phase data. Taking into account that the ΔΙP values of the various compounds were smaller than those calculated in the gas phase indicates that lower is the possibility of an electron-donating mechanism even in the polar media. The second mechanistic route, SPLET, was rather not probable granted that the calculated PA values were found to be higher than that of phenol for most of the compounds (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02342-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). In those cases that the PA values were lower, the difference was negligible (≤1.0 kcal/mol). The ionization of -O-H was much easier than that of the C-H.
