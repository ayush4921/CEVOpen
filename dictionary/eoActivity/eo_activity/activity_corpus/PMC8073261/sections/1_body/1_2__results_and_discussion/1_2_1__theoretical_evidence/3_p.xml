<p>After locating the most stable conformation, appropriate molecular indices were calculated in the gas and liquid phases to characterize the scavenging of free radicals via the three prevailing mechanisms, namely hydrogen atom transfer (HAT), single-electron transfer followed by proton transfer (SET-PT), and sequential proton loss followed by electron transfer (SPLET). The examination was first carried out in the gas phase aiming at exploring the role of the structural characteristics without any external influence. Calculations in the liquid phase were carried out to simulate, as previously mentioned, real systems. To get insight into the role of structural features in the predicted activity, except for Phe, which was selected as a reference compound with no or negligible activity, other structurally related compounds, most of which are constituents of natural EOs, were included (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02342-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The computed indices in the gas phase are given in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02342-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. For SET-PT and SPLET mechanisms, the values of ionization potential (IP) and proton affinity (PA) are only provided considering that these values are critical to highlight whether test compounds can follow any of these two mechanisms. In the same table, the relative difference (Î”) of each value to that computed for Phe (reference) is also provided for better evaluation of the activity.
