<p>The BDE values in the four selected solvents are given in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02342-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Based on the BDE values for the test compounds bearing labile -O-H and/or -C-H, the same trend in activity was observed in all solvents. The C-H BDE values remained lower than those of the -O-H and, in agreement with gas-phase findings, slight was the influence of aromatic ring substitution. MEug was found to be a potent hydrogen atom donor with the activity estimated to be higher according to the calculated ΔBDE values in comparison to that obtained in the gas phase. The contribution of an -OCH
 <sub>3</sub> at 
 <italic>o</italic>-position was more pronounced, especially in more polar environments as Guai, Eug, and iEug were also more potent than in the gas phase. The extension of conjugation in the side chain (iEug) reduced the BDE value by 2.7–3.0 kcal/mol.
