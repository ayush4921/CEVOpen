<p>Electron donation is favored in polar media as the process, regardless of SET-PT or SPLET, leads to charge separation. In the first mechanistic route, IP is the rate-determining parameter. In terms of the corresponding computed values, as well as that of the compounds examined for comparison, it was also evident that all the introduced structural features to MEug contributed to the lowering of the IP value by 25.0 kcal/mol compared to Phe (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02342-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). More specifically, the introduction of a -OCH
 <sub>3</sub> in the aromatic ring (Guai) or replacement of a phenolic -O-H group by an -OCH
 <sub>3</sub> (Anis) favored the electron donation more. Both these features should account for the significant lowering of IP value in MEug considering the finding for Ver. Less was expected to be the contribution of the side chain as the further reduction by comparing the IP values of MEug and Ver was calculated to be only 3.8 kcal/mol. Similar were the findings for Eug (reduction by 6.4 kcal/mol) comparing the IP value to that of Guai. As also observed for HAT, the influence of the prop-2-en-1-yl chain was lower than that observed for those compounds with extended conjugation (prop-1-en-1-yl) in the side chain of the same length (the IP values of iEug, MiEug, and Aneth were 9, 8, and 11.4 kcal/mol lower than that of Eug, MEug, and Est, respectively). This is further supported by the difference (14.5 kcal/mol) reported in the literature for Aneth and Est according to the vertical ionization potential values in the aqueous phase [

Based on the obtained values, MEug was predicted to be a better electron donor than Eug. It should be mentioned, though, that taking into account the observations made by Wright et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-26-02342" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], none of these compounds should act via SET as the computed gas-phase ΔIP values, even the larger ones for iEug and MEug, were lower than those reported for tocopherols (30.5–36.1 kcal/mol) for which mechanistic studies indicate that HAT is the preferable route of action. Therefore, there was no need to calculate proton-dissociation enthalpy values characterizing the second step of SET-PT. The second mechanistic route, SPLET, was not feasible because the formation of anions was not expected according to the calculated proton affinity values (PA) in the gas phase, which were found to be higher than that of Phe (348.0 kcal/mol) or negligibly lower (−0.5 kcal/mol for iEug). The case of the compounds lacking an -O-H group formation of anions through ionization of a carbon atom was expected to be even less possible in terms of gas-phase PA values (360.9–364.6 kcal/mol). This is in accordance with the PA values computed in the gas and aqueous phase by Boulebd [
