<p>Conclusively, theoretical suggestions indicated that MEug may contribute to the preservative activity of bay laurel EO through radical scavenging via allyl hydrogen atom donation. Such a contribution should be lower than that of Eug which may donate two hydrogen atoms following a sequential HAT mechanism. Experimental evidence supported theoretical suggestions and additionally indicated that Eug despite being found at low concentration in bay laurel EO influences the most its radical scavenging efficiency. Our findings contribute to the knowledge for MEug and Eug radical scavenging activity per se or as constituents of bay laurel EO.</p>
