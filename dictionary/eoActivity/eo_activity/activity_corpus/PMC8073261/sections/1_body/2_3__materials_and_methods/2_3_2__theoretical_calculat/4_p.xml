<p>No spin contamination was found for radicals, the total spin operator ⟨S2⟩ values being about 0.750 in all cases, suggesting that the used wavefunctions were reliable regarding geometries, energies, and population analyses. Implicit solvent effects (water) were taken into account with the aid of integral equation formalism of the polarized continuum model (IEF-PCM) and the united atom for Hartree−Fock (UAHF) solvation radii [

Structure optimization of the parent molecules and derived species was carried out in the liquid phase using the above model at the 6-31G level of theory. Then single-point electronic energies were obtained using the 6-311++G(2d,2p) basis set. All the computed values of thermodynamic molecular descriptors were expressed in kcal/mol (1 Hartree = 627.509 kcal/mol).
