<p>All calculations for tested compounds were performed by the Gaussian 09W rev. A.02- SMP program [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-26-02342" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The B3LYP functional was used for geometry optimization and computation of harmonic vibrational frequencies using the 6-31G basis set (unrestricted B3LYP for the resulting phenoxy and cation radicals). Single-point electronic energies were then obtained using the 6-311++G(2d,2p) basis set, including dipole moment values (Debye, D). Employing the electronic energies (298 K) at 6-311++G(2d,2p) and thermal contributions to enthalpy obtained at 6-31G, the bond dissociation enthalpy (BDE) values that characterize hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) activity were determined according to the equation:
