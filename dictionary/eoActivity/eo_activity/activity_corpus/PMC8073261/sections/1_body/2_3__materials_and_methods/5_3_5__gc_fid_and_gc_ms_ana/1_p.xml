<p>The GC-FID analyses were accomplished with an Agilent 6890A gas chromatograph equipped with a split-splitless injector. Samples were analyzed on a TR-FAME capillary column (60 m × 0.25 mm i.d., film thickness 0.25 μm) (Thermo Scientific, Bellefonte, PA, USA). Helium was used as carrier gas at a constant flow rate (2 mL/min). Samples were diluted in dichloromethane 2% (
 <italic>v/v</italic>) and then injected (2 μL) manually onto the GC in split mode with a 25:1 ratio. The injector and detector were both kept at 240 °C. Separation conditions used were as follows: oven temperature was initially set at 40 °C for 5 min, then raised to 100 °C at 15 °C/min, then to 140 °C at 5 °C/min, held for 1 min, and finally raised at 240 °C at 15 °C/min and kept for 5 min. All analyses were performed in duplicate. The repeatability was checked (CV% = 2.9, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 5). For the GC-MS analyses, an Agilent 6890A gas chromatograph (GC) was employed equipped with a Mass Selective Detector MSD 5973 mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) and a DB-WAX capillary column (polyethylene glycol: 30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.33 µm film thickness) (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The carrier gas, sample preparation, injection, and separation conditions were as previously described. The transfer line temperature was set at 240 °C. MS conditions were as follows: ionization energy, 70 eV; electronic impact ion source temperature, 230 °C; scan rate, 2.36 scan/s; mass range, 35–350 amu. The solvent delay time was set at 7 min. Selected volatile constituents were identified by comparing their retention time (t
 <sub>R</sub>) with that of standard compounds and their mass spectra with data from the NIST library (Version 2.0f, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, USA, 2008) and published literature. In addition, retention indices (RIs) were determined relative to the t
 <sub>R</sub> of series of 
 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes (C
 <sub>8</sub>–C
 <sub>30</sub>).
