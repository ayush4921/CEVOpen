<p>The concentration of MEug and Eug that caused 50% radical scavenging (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) was calculated by plotting the RSA% values vs. the corresponding [AH]/[DPPH
 <sup>•</sup>], mol/mol, ratio. RSA% values obtained for the EOs were converted to µmol Trolox or α-tocopherol per mg EO via the construction of 5-point standard curves using solutions of 0.1–0.55 mM (0.06–0.32 [AH]/[DPPH
 <sup>•</sup>], mol/mol).
