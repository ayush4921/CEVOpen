<p>The antioxidant activity of bay laurel EOs, as well as that of standards, was determined using the DPPH
 <sup>•</sup> assay according to Sellami et al. [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-26-02342" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] with some modifications. A radical solution was prepared in methanol at a concentration of 0.06 mM. Methanolic solutions of standard compounds were prepared in a range of concentrations namely 0.5–6 mM for Eug, 4–400 mM for MEug, α-pinene, 1,8-cineole, and linalool, whereas those of the EOs were at 5 mg/mL. An aliquot of 40 and 100 μL of standards and EOs solutions, was mixed with 2960 and 2900 μL of DPPH
 <sup>•</sup> solution, respectively. After mixing for 20 s using a vortex, the absorbance of the test solutions was recorded at 515 nm with a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV 1601, Kyoto, Japan) after storage in the dark at room temperature for 1 h. The absorbance of standards solutions was also recorded after 20 h. Each measurement was carried out in triplicate and appropriate blanks were used for correction. The repeatability of the procedure was checked (CV% = 5, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 5). Radical scavenging activity % (RSA%) was calculated using the following equation:
