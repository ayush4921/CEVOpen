  <p>The following are available online. Table S1: Internal coordinates of the optimized structures of the test compounds in the gas-phase at B3LYP/6-31G, Figure S1: GC-MS chromatograms of bay laurel EO samples. Peaks 1–7 were cross-referenced against the NIST mass spectral library (version 2.0f, 2008) and assigned to (1) limonene, (2) 1,8-cineole, (3) linalool, (4) terpinen-4-ol, (5) α-terpinyl acetate, (6) MEug, and (7) Eug.</p>
