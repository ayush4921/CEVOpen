 <p>Kuromoji (
  <italic>Lindera umbellata</italic>) is a tree that grows throughout Japan. The components of kuromoji essential oil have antitumor and aromatherapy effects. However, the composition of the hydrosol, obtained as a by-product of the essential oil process, is unknown. Furthermore, it is unknown whether kuromoji essential oil has a deodorizing effect. Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to compare the chemical composition of kuromoji essential oil and hydrosol, as well as evaluate the deodorizing effect of the former. The chemical composition of samples was evaluated using gas chromatographyâ€“mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Additionally, the deodorizing effect of Kuromoji essential oil was investigated with the detector tube method using ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan, and isovaleric acid. Linalool was the most abundant component in both the essential oil and hydrosol; however, its proportion was higher in the hydrosol (57.5%) than in the essential oil (42.8%). The hydrosol contained fewer chemical components, but higher proportions of trans-geraniol and ethanol. Moreover, the essential oil eliminated 50% of ammonia and 97.6% or more of isovaleric acid. Interestingly, linalool was soluble in the hydrosol and did not irritate the skin. This suggests that the hydrosol may be an effective foot care product.
