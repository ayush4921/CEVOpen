<p>Maeda et al. (2012) reported that kuromoji essential oil contains linalool (65.78%), geranyl acetate (17.59%), geraniol (5.29%), and 1,8-cineole (2.34%) [

The content of geranyl acetate determined in the latter study was higher than that of the essential oil in the present study (1.02%), and was not detected in the hydrosol. In the present study, 1,8-cineole constituted 13.7% and 13.9% of the essential oil and hydrosol, respectively. These differences may be due to variations in the kuromoji production area and harvest season.
