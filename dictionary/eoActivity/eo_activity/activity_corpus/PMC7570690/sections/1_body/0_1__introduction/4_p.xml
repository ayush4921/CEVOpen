<p>In this study, we compared the chemical components of kuromoji essential oil and kuromoji hydrosol. Furthermore, we evaluated the deodorizing effect of kuromoji essential oil against ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and methyl mercaptan, which were used to emulate toilet and human waste odors; isovaleric acid was used as an index of body and foot odor. Although hydrosols do not have the immediate effect of drugs, they are gentle and effective. Therefore, we anticipate their application for deodorization purposes.</p>
