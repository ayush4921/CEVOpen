<p>One-liter Erlenmeyer flasks were charged with malodorous substances, such as ammonia (150 ppm), hydrogen sulfide (20 ppm), methyl mercaptan (5 ppm), and isovaleric acid (50 ppm). After adding 1 g of kuromoji essential oil, the mixture was left to stand at room temperature for 30 min. Thereafter, the residual concentration of each substance in the flask was measured using a kitagawa gas detector tube (Komyo rikagaku kogyo K.K., Kanagawa, Japan) connected to an aspirating pump (AP-20) and used to calculate the deodorizing rate. These experiments and analyses were performed once for each odor at Biostir Inc. (Osaka, Japan).</p>
