<p>The analysis of the constituents of kuromoji essential oil and hydrosol was carried out using GC-MS (QP2010 Plus; Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan). The GCMS-QP2010 Plus was equipped with a DB-5ms column (Agilent J&amp;W; Agilent Technologies Japan Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and a Stabilwax column (Shimadzu) for the analysis of the essential oil and hydrosol, respectively. The column oven temperature was programmed as follows: 40 °C for 2 min, increased by 10 °C/min afterward till the temperature reached 240 °C. The constituents were identified by matching computer-generated mass spectral data with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) mass spectral database. These experiments and analyses were performed at Kohga International Trading Co., Ltd. (Fukuoka, Japan).</p>
