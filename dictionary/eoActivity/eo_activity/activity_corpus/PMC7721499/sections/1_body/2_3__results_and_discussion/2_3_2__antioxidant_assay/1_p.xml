<p>The radical quenching activities of the samples were measured by using various methods (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The radical scavenging ability of the fraction increased considerably in comparison with the waste in ABTS, DPPH, and nitric oxide assays. Furthermore, the fraction was more powerful to reduce Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> to Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> in the FRAP method in comparison with waste water.
