<p> Bicyclol was shown to have antiviral activity 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> but also 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Preliminary studies in mice have started using a combination of bicyclol and heat shock proteins as a potential adjuvant and, in some reports, the wide use in China since 2004 is mentioned 
 <xref rid="RE0408-14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> . Bicyclol might be active against the hepatitis C virus (HCV) as well, but contractionary data published do not give full evidence for the safety and efficacy of the drug 
 <xref rid="RE0408-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> . The mechanism is still unclear, although modulation of MHC-I-mediated cytotoxicity of T cells against virus infected cells is discussed. In the case of HIV-1, lignans have been shown to inhibit reverse transcriptase activity 
 <xref rid="RE0408-16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> . Schr√∂der et al. 
 <xref rid="RE0408-16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> conducted structure-activity studies on various lignans and showed that the lactone pharmacophore is essential and later, Eich et al. 
 <xref rid="RE0408-17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> documented that the pattern and number of aromatic hydroxyl substituents are important for the antiviral activity as well. Besides these two most important lignans, others have been studied and tested as well. Some with significant antiviral activities are listed in
