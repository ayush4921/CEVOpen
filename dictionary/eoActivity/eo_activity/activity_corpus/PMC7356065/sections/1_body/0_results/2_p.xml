<p> For example, enveloped viruses (e.g., coronavirus, influenza virus, or RSV) have an envelope of a lipid bilayer derived from cellular membrane systems of the host cell 
 <xref rid="RE0408-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> . These virus envelopes are relatively easily attacked by many exogenous compounds (e.g., solvents, detergents, lipophilic substances such as essential oils). The lipid layer often also contains (glyco)proteins, which can protrude in an exposed manner 
 <xref rid="RE0408-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> . In many cases, these proteins are responsible for the highly specific recognition of the respective host cells, the associated physical interactions, the subsequent adhesion, and thus ultimately also for the invasion of the virus into the host cell 
 <xref rid="RE0408-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> . Well-known examples are the haemagglutinin of influenza viruses 
 <xref rid="RE0408-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> or the S-proteins of coronaviruses 
 <xref rid="RE0408-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> . The typical point of entry for such pathogens via droplet infection is the nasopharynx. For influenza viruses, the subsequent colonisation of the epithelia is more likely to occur in the bronchial area, whereas COVID-19 infections, for example, become manifest by interaction of the viral envelope proteins with complementary binding structures in the throat area.
