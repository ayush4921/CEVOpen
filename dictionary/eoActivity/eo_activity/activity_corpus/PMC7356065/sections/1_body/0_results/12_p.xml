<p> There are many natural products and medicinal plants that are supposed to modulate immune functions

 <xref rid="RE0408-29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> . Preparations from 
 <italic>Echinacea</italic> species are probably most widely used and best investigated. They have traditionally been used against sepsis and have shown direct antiviral effects under 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions, and also modulatory effects on macrophages and NK cells

 <xref rid="RE0408-36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> . There has also been intensive research on the active principles. Alkamides seem to play a major role. They are readily bioavailable and bind to cannabinoid receptors, which are the key to stimulating the immune system

 <italic>Echinacea</italic> is an excellent example of how natural product research from bench to bedside can create a lot of scientific evidence for the usefulness of herbal medicine in viral infections. There are many more such plants used in global ethnomedicine that still wait for evaluation.
