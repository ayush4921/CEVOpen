<p> What about activating a compromised immune system by natural products or medicinal plants? It is primarily our immune system that protects us from viral infections. As soon as the immune system notices a viral infection, it begins to fight the invaders, for example, with antibodies and proteins that prevent docking and penetration into the cells

Host cells that are already infected by viruses begin to produce interferon and release it to neighbouring cells, which slows down the multiplication of viruses. Interferons also attract natural killer (NK) cells that detect and eliminate virus-infected cells

Also, with advancing age, starting at about 60 years, the formation of B- and T-lymphocytes is reduced, resulting in a higher susceptibility to infections. It is of special interest in the current situation that obesity also obviously impairs the functionality of NK cells
