<p> Besides tannins, certain essential oils also appear to have antiviral potential against enveloped viruses

 <xref rid="RE0408-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> . In addition, in this case, the interaction with viral envelope proteins, which reduces the docking or uptake of the viruses into the cell, is of particular importance. Most of the investigations were performed on 
 <italic>herpes simplex</italic> viruses (HSV-1/2), but for 1,8-cineol, the main component of eucalyptus oil, protective effects were also observed in mice infected with influenza virus C (IFV-C) 
 <xref rid="RE0408-20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> . These effects seem to be mainly caused by a reduction of the inflammatory reactions that affect the lungs during pneumonia rather than by a direct antiviral effect. Some high-quality preparations are available in some markets, and there is a huge potential for improved and novel products. Furthermore, of course, there are substantial differences in the phytochemical composition and thus in the biological activity of essential oils. An interesting example in the current situation is the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> activity of laurel oil against SARS-CoV. The essential oil from the aerial parts of the laurel tree ( 
 <italic>Laurus nobilis</italic> ) inhibited the replication of the virus 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> more strongly than other essential oils from other species investigated 
 <xref rid="RE0408-18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> . Laurel oil contains larger amounts of the monoterpenes 1,8-cineol and 
 <italic>β</italic> -ocimen and the sesquiterpene dehydrocostus lactone 
 <xref rid="RE0408-18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> . However, sage oil, rich in 1,8-cineol, showed a weaker effect 
 <xref rid="RE0408-18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> . Inhalative applications of laurel oil would therefore be conceivable here, but its allergenic potential should be considered. In addition to essential oil, sage leaves ( 
 <italic>Salvia officinalis</italic> L.) contain tannins (depsides), so preparations such as gargle solutions could also be applied successfully.
