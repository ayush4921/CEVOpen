<p>In the current situation with a shortfall of surgical masks, there is an urgent need for protection strategies for populations at high risk such as the elderly, immunocompromised patients, or patients with respiratory disease as well as for personnel in nursing homes, ambulatory care, and hospitals. Placebo-controlled randomised clinical trials to assess the efficacy of shelter strategies using natural products are ethically problematic to conduct in groups at high risk for infection. This would mean to withhold a possible effective product in half of the subjects. However, the use of such preparations in high-risk groups could be accompanied by non-interventional observational studies. This could gain at least some knowledge on the feasibility of such a protection strategy using natural products.</p>
