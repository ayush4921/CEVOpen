<p>Since early 2020 coronaviruses, mainly severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV‑2, have become a global concern, and also SARS‑CoV‑1 and MERS‑CoV caused epidemic problems in former years. For many many decades, influenza viruses have been a plague, rhinoviruses and the annual cold, adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and bronchial diseases caused many problems – virus particles do indeed make our lives difficult. The use of potent antiviral drugs is possible in some cases and is also established within relevant therapies (e.g., against influenza), but – and this is the bad news – against most viral pathogens in the throat and upper airways, we do not have specific and highly effective substances. On the other hand, there could well be ways to protect oneself going beyond general public health recommendations. While currently all sorts of claims are being advocated in the popular press, here we call for a careful assessment of what might be meaningful adjuvant approaches, especially in milder forms of such respiratory infections.</p>
