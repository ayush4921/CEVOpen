<p> Why not consider protecting the mouth and throat area against the penetration of such virus particles? Enveloped virus particles can be attacked by exogenous noxae – would it be conceivable to achieve a certain degree of protection through a topical treatment of the oral mucosa? In the field of natural substances, we know some drugs that contain large amounts of tannins. This very heterogeneous group of natural substances includes the proanthocyanidins (syn. condensed tannins), hydrolysable tannins (syn. gallotannins), and the so-called Lamiaceae tannins (depsides). They all have in common that they interact with proteins and are able to considerably change or inhibit protein structure and functionality. Tannins therefore often have nonspecific antimicrobial effects but can also inhibit the functionality of viral envelope proteins. Inhibitory effects of condensed tannins or extracts containing tannins on the influenza virus or RSV are known from several publications 
 <xref rid="RE0408-5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> ,  
 <xref rid="RE0408-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> . Mechanistic investigations using a purified proanthocyanidin (procyanidin B2-3- 
 <italic>O</italic> -digallate) showed that this polyphenol rather specifically inhibits the binding domain of haemagglutinin of the influenza A virus, which makes it impossible for the virus particle to adhere to the host cell 
 <xref rid="RE0408-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> . Similar effects have also been reported against 
 <italic>herpes simplex</italic> viruses (HSV-1), where the corresponding adhesion proteins in the virus envelope could as well be considered as a target

 <xref rid="RE0408-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> ,  
 <xref rid="RE0408-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> . Such proanthocyanidins are quite widespread in the medicinal plant sector (e.g., green tea, common sorrel, 
 <italic>Cistus</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Pelargonium</italic> spp., etc.). Of course, these plants cannot be used as a therapeutic agent for manifesting viral infections. In the authorsʼ view, it would be quite conceivable to use dosage forms to locally apply concentrated tanning extracts for local application in the oral cavity for prophylaxis and as an adjuvant therapy (provided that there are no risks of interactions). Sorrel prepared as lozenges or chewing gums, which contain proanthocyanidins in the highest possible concentration, offer such opportunities. In addition, other pharmaceutical preparations like gargle and mouthwash solutions containing such extracts have been used locally and traditionally and may offer novel opportunities. One could argue that such prophylactic methods only offer short-term protection as long as the lozenge is sucked, or the gargle solution is kept in the mouth. However, one can expect that such preparations reduce the pathogen load in the oral cave and these measures could be used during a possible exposure or immediately thereafter. There are further possible points of attack, but this would have to be further substantiated by specific investigations, especially in human volunteer studies. Tannins also interact with protein components in the oral cavity, e.g., salivary proteins and with surface proteins of the mucous membrane epithelia 
 <xref rid="RE0408-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> . Everyone is certainly aware of the change in how the mouth feels after ingestion of preparations containing tannins (e.g., long-brewed black tea). In principle, this is due to tannin interactions on and with the epithelial cells, i.e., we slightly tan the buccal and tongue surface easily. The tannins are naturally immobilized on the epithelia, so they should be present for a longer period of time and perhaps also retarded. Perhaps this could also inhibit an incoming virus from adhering? This remains to be investigated, but there is a good chance that this hypothesis could be correct.
