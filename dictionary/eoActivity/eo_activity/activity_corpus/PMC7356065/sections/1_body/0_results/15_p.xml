<p>Medicinal plants and natural products provide a huge potential to fight against pathogens! During evolution, plants and also other organisms have developed excellent and highly efficient defence mechanisms and antipathogenic defence compounds. We should strengthen activities to explore and to develop this potential. This needs more and intensified science for pinpointing the active medicinal plants, identifying active compounds, and investigating potential synergistic effects when dealing with complex mixtures. We also have to explore the chemistry behind the active ingredients. We have to develop sustainable technology for efficient production (not only milligrams are needed, but economically relevant amounts at affordable prices), and we have to initiate preclinical, toxicological, and clinical trials. There is definitely a long way to a more evidence-based phytotherapy or integration of highly active natural products into clinical practice.</p>
