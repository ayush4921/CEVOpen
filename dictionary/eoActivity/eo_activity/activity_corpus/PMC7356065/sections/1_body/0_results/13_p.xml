<p> Globally, local and traditional medicines remain a major source of health care 
 <xref rid="RE0408-39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> . In China, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has already played an important role treating SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 infections. During the first SARS epidemic in Guangdong, all patients received Chinese medicine treatments over different stages of the disease in addition to biomedical treatments. The most commonly used formulations were

 <italic>Qing Ying Tang</italic> , containing mixtures of many different herbs. In Hong Kong, a combination of

 <italic>Yu Ping Feng San</italic> , plus two other botanicals, Isatidis folium ( 
 <italic>Isatis tinctoria</italic> L.) and Scutellariae radix ( 
 <italic>Scutellaria</italic> spp.), have been used with success to protect high-risk hospital workers against Sars-CoV infection

 <xref rid="RE0408-41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> , during the first SARS-CoV crisis in China, 40 to 60% of the infected patients received Chinese medicine treatment on top of standard modern medicine treatment at some stages of the disease. The results indicate positive but inconclusive indications about the efficacy of the combined treatments using Chinese medicine as an adjuvant
