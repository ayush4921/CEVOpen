<p> During the recent SARS-CoV-2 infections, TCM has been again widely applied in China. According to a recent report, more than 85% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients have received TCM treatment in China 
 <xref rid="RE0408-42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> . The used formulations and natural products have been recently reviewed 
 <xref rid="RE0408-42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> . In one survey, Luo et al. 
 <xref rid="RE0408-43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> found that

 <italic>Cyrtomium fortunei</italic> J. Sm. were the ten most commonly used Chinese medicinal plants in the treatment of COVID-19. Yang et al. 
 <xref rid="RE0408-42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> concluded that more and better controlled clinical studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of TCM in the treatment of SARS-CoV. In addition, standardised products should be used rather than self-prepared formulations. They also recommended that the safety of TCM treatment should be evaluated. It shows that there is huge potential, but a lot of basic and clinical research is still needed to understand the mechanisms of action in order to end up in evidence-based medicine. Importantly, the underlying philosophical concepts differ 
 <xref rid="RE0408-44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> and it is certainly difficult to assess many of these approaches in bioscientific terms. At the same time, it would be negligent to just ignore this large body of scholarship and, more importantly, the widespread use of preparations derived from, in this case, TCM. There is a tremendous research agenda with which we need to engage, and this will be a core task for research to develop novel therapeutic approaches.
