  <italic>Tarchonanthus Camphoratus</italic> L. is traditionally known for its various medicinal purposes. In this study, the 
  <italic>T. camphoratus</italic> essential oil (TCEO) was isolated via steam distillation, and its chemical constituents were determined using GC–MS. The 
  <italic>in vitro</italic> antiproliferative effects of TCEO on A549, HepG2, MCF-7 cancer cells, and HUVEC non-tumor cells was investigated using an MTT assay. Flow cytometry analysis was conducted to evaluate cell cycle distribution using propidium iodide staining, and cell death mode using Annexin V-FITC/PI assays. The expression of some apoptosis related genes was investigated using qRT-PCR. Major constituents of TCEO included fenchol, borneol, 3-cyclohexene-1-methanol and 3-ethyl-3-methyl. Cell viability test showed that TCEO is highly effective against MCF-7 cells with IC
  <sub>50</sub> 12.5 µg/mL. Cell cycle arrest at the G1/S phase, and apoptosis mediation were evident in the presence of TCEO. Gene expression analysis of several pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes revealed the initiation of apoptosis in TCEO-MCF-7 cells. In conclusion, our study confirms the antiproliferative activity of the 
  <italic>T. camphoratus</italic> essential oil.
