<p id="p0035">The proliferation of breast (MCF-7), liver (HepG2), lung (A549) cancer cell lines, and non-tumorigenic (HUVEC) cells were assessed using MTT assay, according to 
 <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et al., (2018)</xref>, with slight modification. In 96-well plates, cells were plated at 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cell/ml, then incubated for 24 h. TCEO at 12.5, 25, 50, 100 and 200 μg/mL was added after 24 h of incubation, then allowed to incubate for another 24 h. After 48 h of incubation, MTT solution (5 mg/ml) was added (10 μL/well) and incubated for 2–4 h at 37 °C. After the incubation, formazan crystals end product was dissolved with 0.1 mL acidified isopropanol, and the plate was put on a shaker for 10–15 min. The plate was read using a plate reader (BioTek, USA) at 570 nm. The inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) was calculated from the dose-dependent curve using OriginPro 8.5 software. The cell viability percentage was calculated using the following formula: Cell Viability % = (O.D. of TCEO wells/O.D. of untreated wells) × 100.
