 <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">Blowman et al. (2018)</xref>, reviewed that several EO can induce different pathways of apoptosis. Therefore, the manner of cell death induced by TCEO in MCF-7 cells was also inspected. In this study, apoptosis induction was confirmed by Annexin V staining and supported by RT-PCR data. It is well known that Bcl-2 family genes play a crucial role in the initiation of apoptosis. In addition, the elevated levels of activated caspases ultimately lead to apoptotic cell death as a results of decrease or increase expression of these genes (

 <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">Kale et al., 2018</xref>). Based on this, our gene expression results showed that the level of Bcl-2 decreases, while that of Bax increases in MCF-7 treated cells. Furthermore, treatment of MCF-7 cells with TCEO triggers a dose-dependent expression of P53, caspases-9,8 and 3, confirming the involvement of apoptosis in TCEO-induced cell death. Our data are in line with different studies that reported the involvement of EO in inducing apoptosis through the alteration of the expression levels of Bcl-2 and Bax genes (
