<p>For many years, parsley (
 <italic>Petroselinum crispum</italic> (Mill.) Fuss) and its concentrated preparations have been used in South America and Italy to induce abortion, which often ended in death due to severe post abortive vaginal bleeding [
 <xref rid="B136-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. The abortifacient effect is attributed to parsley apiole, a main component in most parsley leaf and seed oils. Parsley apiole and dill apiole are bicyclic phenylpropenoid ethers. Parsley apiole is found in parsley seed oil (11.3–67.5%) [
 <xref rid="B58-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] while dill apiole is found in Indian dill (
 <italic>Anethum sowa</italic> Roxb. ex Flem.) seed oil (20.7–52.5%) [
 <xref rid="B23-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and parsley leaf oil (0.2–5.2%) [
 <xref rid="B22-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B57-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Parsley apiole poisoning causes severe neurotoxicity which presents a risk of abortion [
 <xref rid="B137-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. Signs of parsley apiole intoxication include fever, severe abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, abortion, convulsions, vomiting, and diarrhea [
 <xref rid="B138-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. A single gavage dose of parsley apiole (10 mL/kg) was sufficient to kill all experimental mice within 60 hours due to liver and kidney toxicity [
 <xref rid="B139-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. Doses of 5–14 g caused severe hemorrhage and induced abortion in pregnant rabbits [
 <xref rid="B140-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. Parsley leaf and seed oils are hepatotoxic, nephrotoxic, and may be abortifacient if taken orally. Topical application of parsley oils is also inadvisable during pregnancy [
 <xref rid="B88-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Since there are no safety thresholds for parsley apiole in humans, internal and external use of parsley apiole-rich essential oils is not recommended in pregnancy due to the high risk of abortion. The structural similarity to parsley apiole suggests that dill apiole could carry the same toxicity and could be hazardous in pregnancy. Therefore, it is best to avoid apiole-rich oils (all routes) throughout pregnancy and breastfeeding [
