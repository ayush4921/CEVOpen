<p>Citral is not mutagenic or carcinogenic [
 <xref rid="B155-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>]. However, it has shown some reproductive toxicity in animal studies. Citral reduced the fertility of female Wistar rats through decreasing the number of normal ovarian follicles [
 <xref rid="B156-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>]. Citral is a well-known retinoic acid synthesis inhibitor [
 <xref rid="B157-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>,
 <xref rid="B158-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>,
 <xref rid="B159-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>,
 <xref rid="B160-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>]. In epithelial tissues, citral has been shown to antagonize the activity of vitamin A and prevent the oxidation of retinol to retinoic acid [
 <xref rid="B161-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>]. In mouse epidermis, citral inhibited tissue morphogenesis and tumor production [
 <xref rid="B159-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>,
 <xref rid="B162-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>]. When tested on embryos of white Leghorn chicken, citral showed a dose-dependent teratogenic effect represented by inducing malformations and abnormal eye development [
 <xref rid="B163-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>,
 <xref rid="B164-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>,
 <xref rid="B165-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>]. Citral was reported to act via suppressing the activity of the enzyme ALDH1A1 responsible for retinoic acid synthesis, which in turn affects fetal development [
 <xref rid="B166-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>]. Citral (55 mM) partially inhibited the initiation of meiotic division in human fetal ovary tissues which relies partially on retinoic acid [
 <xref rid="B166-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>]. The oral NOAEL for citral-induced prenatal toxicity was set as &lt; 60 mg/kg/day [
 <xref rid="B167-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>]. Orally administered citral (at 60, 125, 250, 500, and 1000 mg/kg on days 6 to 15 of pregnancy) produced signs of embryo-fetotoxicity (growth retardation, skeletal abnormalities, and spleen weight increase) and maternal toxicity (decreased maternal weight gain, increased resorptions, and impaired implantation) in pregnant Wistar rats [
 <xref rid="B167-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>]. Citral was teratogenic in studies with chick embryos [
 <xref rid="B168-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">168</xref>,
 <xref rid="B169-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>]. The teratogenic effects of citral were also observed in 
 <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos treated with 60 mM [
 <xref rid="B170-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>]. After exposure to 1.75 mM of citral for 24 h, tooth development was completely inhibited in 70% CD-1 Swiss mouse embryonic mandible explants while the addition of retinoic acid restored odontogenesis [
 <xref rid="B171-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>]. When injected intra-abdominally into pregnant BALB/c mice (&gt;35 mmol/g on the 9th gestational day), citral caused fetal cranial chondrogenesis and osteogenesis restrictions that diminished by adulthood [
 <xref rid="B158-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>]. However, when given to pregnant Wistar rats (by gavage at 125, 250, 500, or 1000 mg/kg on gestational days 6–15), citral caused maternal toxicity, a dose-dependent increase in resorptions per implantation, and a slight teratogenicity [
 <xref rid="B167-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>]. The mechanism of action seems to involve competing with estrogen for estrogen receptors [
 <xref rid="B172-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>]. When applied directly to the rat’s vagina, citral showed estrogenic effects and caused vaginal hyperplasia [
 <xref rid="B172-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>]. Inhalation of citral (for 6 hr/day on gestation days 6–15 at 10 or 34 ppm as vapor, or 68 ppm as an aerosol/vapor mixture) did not cause teratogenicity in Sprague-Dawley rats [
 <xref rid="B168-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">168</xref>]. Due to their high citral content, Australian lemon balm, honey myrtle, lemon basil, lemon petitgrain, lemon myrtle, lemon thyme, lemongrass, lemon tea tree, May chang, Melissa, and lemon verbena EOs are teratogenic and their internal use should be restricted during pregnancy [
