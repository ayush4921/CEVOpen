 <italic>E</italic>)-Anethole was reported to have anti-hypernociceptive, anticancer, antiplatelet, anti-inflammatory, and anesthetic properties [

 <xref rid="B77-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. However, administration of (
 <italic>E</italic>)-anethole-rich EOs (by any route) should be avoided in pregnancy, breastfeeding, and estrogen-dependent cancers. Additionally, internal use of (
 <italic>E</italic>)-anethole-rich EOs is not advisable in childbirth due to its antiplatelet aggregation activity. There is enough evidence for the estrogenic action of (
 <italic>E</italic>)-anethole. (
 <italic>E</italic>)-Anethole was estrogenic in yeast assays (in vitro) [

 <xref rid="B78-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. It was reported to bind to estrogen receptors in engineered yeast cells [

 <italic>E</italic>)-anethole) was estrogenic in vivo [
 <xref rid="B79-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. A notable increase in uterine weight was observed in immature female rats following (
 <italic>E</italic>)-anethole treatment (80 mg/kg/day for 3 days), confirming its estrogenic effect [
 <xref rid="B80-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. (
 <italic>E</italic>)-Anethole showed an anti-implantation effect in pregnant rats. Oral administration of (
 <italic>E</italic>)-anethole (50, 70, and 80 mg/kg on gestational days 1–10) to pregnant albino Charles Foster rats caused a dose-dependent reduction in implantation as a result of a disruption of hormonal balance [
 <xref rid="B80-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. It is worth mentioning that both mice and humans can metabolize (
 <italic>E</italic>)-anethole in a similar way, while rats metabolize it differently [
 <xref rid="B81-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. A metabolite of anethole, anethole-1’,2’-epoxide, was carcinogenic and caused the formation of hepatomas and papillomas in mice [
