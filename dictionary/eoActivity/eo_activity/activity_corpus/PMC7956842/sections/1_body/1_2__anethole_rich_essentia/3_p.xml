<p>Anethole-rich essential oils such as aniseed, star anise, bitter fennel, sweet fennel, and aniseed myrtle are estrogenic in one or more in vitro assays and may cause reproductive hormone modulation [

 <xref rid="B78-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. These oils are hepatotoxic due to their high (
 <italic>E</italic>)-anethole content. Bitter fennel oil is hepatotoxic due to the metabolite, anethole-1’,2’-epoxide [
 <xref rid="B83-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Like bitter fennel EO, sweet fennel EO is a reproductive hormonal level modulator, fetotoxic, and hepatotoxic [
 <xref rid="B84-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Sweet fennel tea (containing 1.3–10.0% of the oil [
 <xref rid="B85-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]) showed in vivo estrogenic activity in humans and its prolonged use caused premature breast development and significantly higher serum estradiol levels [
 <xref rid="B79-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. A sweet fennel oil (with 72% (
 <italic>E</italic>)-anethole, 12.0% fenchone, and 5% estragole) was teratogenic at 0.93 mg/mL and produced about 50% reduction in differentiated rat embryo limb bud foci. It dose-dependently decreased the intensity of oxytocin or prostaglandin E2-induced uterine contractions ex vivo [
 <xref rid="B86-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] which is why the use of sweet fennel oil is not advisable during slow-progressing labor. Therefore, consumption of anethole-rich essential oils is unsafe and should be avoided (by any route) during pregnancy, breastfeeding, and in some estrogen-dependent cancers [

 <xref rid="B88-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. These oils are potentially carcinogenic based on their estragole and safrole (minor components) content [
 <xref rid="B89-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. (
