<p>This review has been prepared based on a comprehensive survey of major scientific databases for the effects of some EOs and their constituents on the female reproductive system during pregnancy and on the development of the fetus. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02380-f001">Figure 1</xref> presents the chemical structures of key essential oil components discussed in this review, while the chemical composition of these oils is summarized in 
 <xref rid="ijms-22-02380-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. It should be noted that because of the ethical and safety issues in human toxicity testing, a substantial weight is usually given to animal testing for reproductive toxicity despite the major differences in reproductive physiologies. EOs or components that showed animal reproductive toxicity should either be prohibited (strictly avoided) or restricted (used with some degree of caution) during pregnancy and lactation.
