<p>In this work, SBPO microcapsules were produced by spray drying. Based on the single‐factor experiment, RSM was used to optimize the operating conditions including GA to MD ratio, total solids content of emulsion, wall to core ratio, and inlet air temperature. The optimal conditions were as follows: GA to MD ratio 2.38, total solids content 39%, wall to core ratio 5.33, and inlet air temperature 154°C. Under the optimal conditions, the ME of microcapsules was 94.96 ± 1.42%, which was satisfactory for the quality requirements of oil microcapsules. The physicochemical properties presented that SBPO microcapsules had low water activity, low moisture content, high water solubility, high bulk density, and good thermal stability, which were useful for subsequent processing.</p>
