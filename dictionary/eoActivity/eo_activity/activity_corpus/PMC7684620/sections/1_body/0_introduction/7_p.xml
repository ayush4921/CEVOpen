<p>In this work, spray‚Äêdrying technology was used to encapsulate SBPO and made the GA and MD as the wall materials. The effects of main factors such as GA to MD ratio, a total solids content of the feed, wall to core ratio, and inlet air temperature on the ME were investigated. As well as, the physicochemical properties of microcapsules including water activity, moisture content, solubility, hygroscopicity, bulk density, morphology, particle size, fatty acids, and peroxide stability were also studied.</p>
