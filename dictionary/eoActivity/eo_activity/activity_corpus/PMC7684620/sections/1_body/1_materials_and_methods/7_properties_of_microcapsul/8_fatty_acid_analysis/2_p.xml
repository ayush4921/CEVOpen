<p>For the fatty acid analysis of encapsulated and unencapsulated SBPO, the methyl esterification of samples was performed by boron trifluoride–methanol method (Moigradean, Poiana, Alda, &amp; Gogoasa, 
 <xref rid="fsn31828-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). The chromatography‐mass spectrometry (GC‐MS) (Thermo Trace 1300‐ISQ QD, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., USA) was used to the analysis of the relative percentage of fatty acids. TG‐5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 µm × 0.32 mm) was used, and helium (purity 99.99%) was taken as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min and a split ratio of 1:30. The warm‐up procedure was as follows: the initial temperature was set at 80°C and increased to 150°C at the rate of 20°C/min for a hold of 1 min. Then, it was increased to 280°C at the rate of 3°C/min for a hold of 10 min. The injector temperature was 280°C. MS spectrum was analyzed in full‐scan mode with the mass range of 33–550 amu and the ionization voltage was 70 eV.
