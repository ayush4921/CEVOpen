<p>The SBPO microcapsules and SBPO were placed in an oven at 60°C to accelerate the oxidation process, and the PV was measured weekly for 4 weeks. 30 g of microcapsules was used to extract the wrapped oil by the following method: Firstly, the microcapsules were placed in a breaker with 300 ml of hexane and the sample was kept a vortex movement for 1 min to remove the surface oil of microcapsules. Then, the solvent was filtered and the microcapsules were air‐dried in the shade and then treated by the same procedure described previously for the extraction of the total oil. The PV of oil was determined referring to the method described by Karaca, Low, and Nickerson (
