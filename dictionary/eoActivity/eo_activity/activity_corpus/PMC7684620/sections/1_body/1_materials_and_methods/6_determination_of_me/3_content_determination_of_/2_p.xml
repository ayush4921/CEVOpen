<p>The method was referred to as Partanen's method (Partanen, Yoshii, Kallio, Yang, &amp; Forssell, 
 <xref rid="fsn31828-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). 4 g of microcapsules were placed in a beaker and added 20 ml of 60°C water. The sample was then mixed with 2 ml of ammonia (25%) and stirred for 30 min at 50°C. Then, the 10 ml ethanol and 25 ml diethyl ether were added in order and gently shaken for 5 min. Finally, 25 ml petroleum ether was added and gently shaken for 5 min. The sample was kept still in some minutes, and phase separate on was allowed to occur. The upper organic phase was collected, and the lower aqueous phase was re‐extracted using ethanol, diethyl ether, and petroleum ether as the above method. Triplicate determinations were performed. All upper phase was collected in the evaporating dish, and the solvent was evaporated. The total oil content was weighted.
