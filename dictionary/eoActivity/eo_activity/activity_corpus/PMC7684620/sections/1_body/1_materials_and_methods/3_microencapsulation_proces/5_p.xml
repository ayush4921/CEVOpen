<p>Spray‐drying emulsion. The O/W emulsion was sprayed by a YC‐1500 laboratory spray dryer with a 0.70 mm diameter rotating atomizer (Yacheng experimental Co. Ltd.). In order to keep homogeneous and stability, the emulsion was stirred constantly by a magnetic stirrer (SHJ‐3, Shuangjie Experimental Instrument Factory) at a constant temperature 50 ± 1°C during the entire process. The inlet temperature was set to test temperature. The pressure of compressed air was set to 0.2 MPa. The microcapsules were harvested and stored in 4°C fridge.</p>
