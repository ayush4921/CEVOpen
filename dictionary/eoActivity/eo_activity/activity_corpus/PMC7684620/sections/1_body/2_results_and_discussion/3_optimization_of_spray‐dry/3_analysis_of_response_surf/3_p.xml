<p>Based on the Equation (
 <xref rid="fsn31828-disp-0007" ref-type="disp-formula">7</xref>), the optimal experimental conditions were as follows: GA to MD ratio 2.38, total solids content 39.08%, wall to core ratio 5.33, and inlet air temperature 153.78°C. Taking into account the actual situation, the experimental conditions were modified slightly as follows: GA to MD ratio 2.38, total solids content 39%, wall to core ratio 5.33, and inlet air temperature 154°C.
