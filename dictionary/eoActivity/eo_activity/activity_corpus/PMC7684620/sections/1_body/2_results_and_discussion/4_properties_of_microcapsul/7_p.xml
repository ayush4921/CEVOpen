<p>Peroxide value was an important indicator of the oxidation degree of oils. The PV of products made from oils was used to identify the quality and degree of spoilage. Changes in PV of unencapsulated and encapsulated SBPO under 60°C were shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31828-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. The initial PV of encapsulated SBPO was higher than that of unencapsulated SBPO, which indicated that spray drying increased the PV of SBPO. A similar phenomenon was also observed in the microencapsulation process of other oils by spray drying, such as crude palm oil (Ferreira et al.,

 <xref rid="fsn31828-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Lavanya et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31828-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>), chia oil (Lavanya et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31828-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>), almond oil (Hoyos‐Leyva, Bello‐Perez, Agama‐Acevedo, Alvarez‐Ramirez, &amp; Jaramillo‐Echeverry, 
 <xref rid="fsn31828-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>), and flaxseed oil (Can Karaca, Low, &amp; Nickerson, 
 <xref rid="fsn31828-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). The increase in PV was often attributed to high temperatures during spray drying. During the high‐temperature acceleration experiment for 4 weeks, the PV of unencapsulated SBPO increased from 5.31 to 52.08 mmol/kg, while the PV of encapsulated SBPO increased from 8.31 to 14.34 mmol/kg. The results presented that the microencapsulation could effectively protect SBPO from oxidation.
