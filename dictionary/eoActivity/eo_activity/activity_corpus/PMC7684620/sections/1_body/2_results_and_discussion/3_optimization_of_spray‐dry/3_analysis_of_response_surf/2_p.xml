<p>The visual interactions among tested variables were presented in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31828-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. As exhibited in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31828-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, wall to core ratio and inlet air temperature had a significant effect on the ME, which demonstrated that the suitable wall to core ratio and inlet air temperature were in favor of the ME. As presented in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31828-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, the ME was given as a function of GA to MD ratio and wall to core ratio when total solids content was fixed at 30% and inlet air temperature at 160°C. At a fixed GA to MD ratio, the ME increased significantly with increasing wall to core ratio until the value of 4 was reached after which the trend of increasing became less significant. Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31828-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2c</xref> showed the interactions between GA to MD ratio and inlet air temperature when total solids content was fixed at 30% and wall to core ratio at 4. At a fixed GA to MD ratio, the ME initially increased and then declined with increasing inlet air temperature. A higher inlet air temperature caused an excessive evaporation and resulted in the crack of microcapsules during spray drying. Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31828-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2d</xref> also showed that the ME initially increased and then declined with increasing GA to MD ratio. As observed in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31828-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2e,f</xref>, at a given inlet air temperature or wall to core ratio, the ME initially increased and then became stabilized with increasing total solids content.
