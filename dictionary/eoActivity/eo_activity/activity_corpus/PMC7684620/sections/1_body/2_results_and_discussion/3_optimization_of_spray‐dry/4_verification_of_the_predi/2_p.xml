<p>In order to test the accuracy of the predictive model, the validation experiment was conducted under the following conditions: GA to MD ratio 2.38, total solids content 39%, wall to core ratio 5.33, and inlet air temperature 154°C. The experimental value of ME was 94.96 ± 1.42% and very close to the predicted value (95.96%). The results suggested that the optimized conditions obtained from the mathematical model were reliable and practical.</p>
