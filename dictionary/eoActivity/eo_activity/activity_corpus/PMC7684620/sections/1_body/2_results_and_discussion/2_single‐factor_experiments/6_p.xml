<p>Meanwhile, inlet air temperature could also affect produced yield and other properties of microcapsules, such as moisture content, water activity, hygroscopicity, color differences, particle size, bulk density, and glass transition temperature. Generally, in the appropriate temperature range, the moisture content and water activity of spray‐dried products decreased with the increasing of inlet air temperature due to high heat transfer and the higher color differences were obtained under higher temperature because of the non‐enzymatic browning reactions. The bigger particles were easily produced under high temperature, which was often contributed to the rapid formation of a hard crust on the surface of the droplets hindered the shrinkage of microparticles. However, there were controversial reports on the effect of inlet air temperature on the hygroscopicity, bulk density, and glass transition temperature of products, which might be contributed to the differences in the properties of raw and wall materials, processing conditions and so on. The detail reports and analysis had been reviewed by Tontul and Topuz (
