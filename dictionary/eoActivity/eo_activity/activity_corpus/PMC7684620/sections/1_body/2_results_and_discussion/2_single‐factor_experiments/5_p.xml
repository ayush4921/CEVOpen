<p>As shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31828-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>, the ME slightly increased from 89.23% to 90.41% with inlet air temperature increasing from 140 to 160°C. When inlet air temperature was further increased to 170°C, the ME slightly decreased to 89.15%, which might have resulted from bursting of the droplet during spray drying. Generally, the ME increased with the increasing of inlet air temperature, the similar phenomenon was also reported by other researchers (Aghbashlo, Mobli, Madadlou, &amp; Rafiee,

Once the hard crust was formed around the particles, it produced a protective effect similar to that of a semi‐permeable membrane and prevented the further leaching of oil droplet to the particle surface, leading to a high ME. When the temperature was too low, the poor microcapsules, with the characteristics of easy clumping, high in water content, and density membrane, would be more prone to appear, caused by the low evaporation rate. However, if the temperature was too high, some bad states would be occurred, such as thermal damage, “ballooning,” excessive bubble growth, and surface defect (Jafari et al.,
