<p>For oil powder, the bad phenomenon of oil oxidation and microbiological growth can occur more easily with high water activity and moisture content. As seen in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31828-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>, the value of water activity and moisture content for microcapsules was 0.44 and 3.18%, respectively, which can be considered quite microbiological stable during storage. The microcapsules had considerable solubility, with a WSI value of 85.56%, due to the excellent water solubility of MD and GA, which were often used as wall materials in the spray‐drying process (Quek, Chok, &amp; Swedlund,
