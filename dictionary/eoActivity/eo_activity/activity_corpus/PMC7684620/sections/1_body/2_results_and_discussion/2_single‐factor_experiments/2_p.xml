<p>The effect of different ratios of GA to MD on ME was studied as shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31828-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>. When the GA to MD ratio was 100:0, ME was 76.45%. With the proportion of MD in wall material increased from 0% to 30%, ME was increased from 76.45% to 88.80%. However, ME continued to decrease once the proportion of MD was more than 30%. The ME was only 44.30% when MD was used as the only wall material. The structure of GA was a highly propped hybrid of glucuronic acid, sugars and a small amount of protein that was covalently linked to the carbohydrate chain through serine and hydroxyproline residues, making it a special emulsifier and film‐forming (Rosenberg et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31828-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">1990</xref>). So the ME was satisfactory when GA was used as the only wall material. The similar result was reported by some researches (Bertolini et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31828-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>; Fang et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31828-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>; McNamee et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31828-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>). The fact that ME was the lowest when MD was used as the only wall material could be explained as a result of the weak emulsification and film formation of MD. The results showed that the blend of GA and MD could improve the ME of sea buckthorn pulp oil, but the proportion of MD should be control in an appropriate extent.
