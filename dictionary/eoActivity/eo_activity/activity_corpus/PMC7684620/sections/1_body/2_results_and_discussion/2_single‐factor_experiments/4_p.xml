<p>As shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31828-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, increasing the wall material content in emulsion could significantly increase the ME. The ME increased from 46.47% to 86.05% with the ratio of wall to core increased from 2 to 4. At the low ratio of wall to oil, the wall material could not effectively wrap more oil, causing some oil to remain on the surface of the microcapsules. At the same time, the low content of wall material may also result in an increase in shell forming time during drying process. With the increasing of wall to core ratio, more oil was sufficiently encapsulated by more wall material, resulting to the increasing of ME. However, the ME was not increased significantly on further increasing wall to core ratio to 6 and 8. Kha et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31828-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) detailedly studied the effect of wall material concentration and oil load on the qualities of gac oil microcapsules by spray drying. The results showed that the ME and encapsulation yield were increased when the gac oil load decreased. Meanwhile, the PV, moisture content, and water activity of gac oil microcapsules were all decreased with the increase of wall material concentration. In the microencapsulation of flaxseed oil by spray drying, Tonon et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31828-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>) also found that the increase in oil concentration directly affected powder properties, resulting in lower ME and higher lipid oxidation. The ME of fish oil microcapsules by spray drying was decreased from 92.10% to 57.39% when the ratio of wall to oil decreased from 2 to 0.67(Tan, Chan, &amp; Heng, 
 <xref rid="fsn31828-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). Therefore, the ratio of wall to core also had important effect on the qualities of product during spray drying.
