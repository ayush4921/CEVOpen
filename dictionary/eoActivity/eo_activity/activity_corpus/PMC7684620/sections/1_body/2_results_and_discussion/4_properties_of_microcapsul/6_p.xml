<p>The main fatty acids of unencapsulated and encapsulated SBPO in the term of peak area (%) were present in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31828-tbl-0004" ref-type="table">4</xref>. Oleic acid was the highest concentration in the unencapsulated and encapsulated SBPO. The concentration of oleic acid reduced from 21.23% to 18.40% after microencapsulation, which could be due to oxidation during the spray‐drying process. The concentration of palmitoleic acid, palmitic acid, and linoleic acid also showed a decreasing trend. However, on the whole, there were no significant changes in the content of the main fatty acids in SBPO before and after spray drying. Wan, Bankston, Bechtel, and Sathivel (
 <xref rid="fsn31828-bib-0060" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>) reported that the content of total saturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids of menhaden fish oil had a slightly increasing after encapsulation by spray drying with soluble rice bran fiber as wall material. Compared to unencapsulated menhaden fish oil, the content of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid in the encapsulated menhaden oil was reduced from 14.49% to 11.52% and from 6.15% to 4.51%, respectively. The similar results were also reported by Lavanya, Kathiravan, Moses, and Anandharamakrishnan (
 <xref rid="fsn31828-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>) in the microencapsulation of fish oil by spray drying with whey protein as wall material. Adamiec and Kalemba (
 <xref rid="fsn31828-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>) compared the changes in compositions of elemi oil and peppermint oil after microencapsulation by spray drying with maltodextrin as wall material. After microencapsulation, the proportion of the main components in elemi oil including α‐thujene, α‐pinene, β‐pinene, p‐cymene, and γ‐terpinene reduced by 10%–30% and the proportion of the main components including sabinene and terpinene‐4‐ol increased 7% and 62%, respectively. However, the proportion of all major components in peppermint oil including menthone, isomenthone, neomenthol, menthol, menthyl acetate, and monoterpene hydrocarbons differed only slightly from the initial oil after microencapsulation. In the process of oil microencapsulation by spray drying, the degree of change of components was influenced by several factors, such as inlet air temperature, properties of wall materials, and self‐thermal stability of components. Therefore, it was important to select appropriate wall materials and operating parameters to reduce the loss of ingredients.
