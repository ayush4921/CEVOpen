<p>It was shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31828-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> that the ME was also affected by total solids content of emulsion. Blow 30% solids, particularly, as the solid content increases, the value of ME increased dramatically. When more than 30%, the increased degree was not markedly. The speed of forming the semi‐permeable membrane was accelerated by increasing the solids of emulsion, which resulted in the reduction of the feed loss (Soottitantawat et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31828-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). The similar phenomenon was also recognized by some researchers (Eccleston et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31828-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>; Kallio, Yang, Peippo, Tahvonen, &amp; Pan, 
 <xref rid="fsn31828-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>; Roccia, Martínez, Llabot, &amp; Ribotta,

 <xref rid="fsn31828-bib-0061" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>). Rosenberg et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31828-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">1990</xref>) recommended that the highest total solids content should be used, while some results showed that a suitable total solids content was practical (Gallardo et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31828-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Gharsallaoui et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31828-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>; Pitalua et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31828-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Roccia et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31828-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Beyond some total solids content, excessive wall materials would not be dissolved due to the limited solubility of wall materials, which made the undissolved wall materials being useless. At the same time, a high emulsion viscosity would be induced with high total solids content, making some difficulties in feeding and atomizing. So there was an optimum total solids content for spray drying.
