<p>The bulk density of microcapsules was 0.48 g/cm

 <xref rid="fsn31828-bib-0059" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). Generally, the power with high bulk density is required because of the need for smaller volumes of packaging. Moreover, the high bulk density suggested a low amount of air inhaled in the space between particles, which helped prevent oxidation and improve stability.
