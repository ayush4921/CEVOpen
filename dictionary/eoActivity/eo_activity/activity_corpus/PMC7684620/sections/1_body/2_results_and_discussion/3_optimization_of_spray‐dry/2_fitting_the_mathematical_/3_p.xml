<p>Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31828-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref> listed the results of ANOVA. The model with the larger absolute value of 
 <italic>F</italic> and the smaller value of 
 <italic>p</italic> was the more significant. Thus, the value of 
 <italic>F</italic> (
 <italic>F</italic> = 94.86) and 
 <italic>p</italic> (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001) suggested that the model was significant. The value of “lack of fit” 
 <italic>F</italic> (
 <italic>F</italic> = 5.09) and the associated 
 <italic>p</italic> (
 <italic>p</italic> = .0655) was not significant, which meant that the model was accurate and applicable. The correlation coefficient (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = .9896) and adjusted correlation coefficient (

   <mi>R</mi>

 <italic>C.V</italic>.% = 3.28) reflected that the experimental values had a good reliability.
