<p>The morphology of microcapsules was shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31828-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. As seen from Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31828-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, there were microcapsules with different morphological features, including round particles and particles with surface dents. It was also shown that the microcapsules with surface dents occupied a large proportion. Many studies had confirmed that the drying temperature taken an important effect on the morphology of microcapsules (Janiszewska &amp; Witrowa‐Rajchert,

At high drying temperatures, the moisture of the particles evaporated quickly, resulting to most of particles having a smooth and hard outer shell. When the drying temperature was low, more residual moisture made the surface of the particles soft, the particles tended to have a shrinking surface. Cracks and pores were not observed in most microcapsules, which was beneficial for the protection of compounds in microcapsules. It was shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31828-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref> that the particle size of microcapsules ranged from 0.01 to 5 μm. The
