 <p>The aim of this work was to encapsulate sea buckthorn (
  <italic>Hippophae rhamnoides</italic> L.) pulp oil (SBPO) by spray drying. Gum Arabic (GA) and maltodextrins (MD) were used as wall materials. The effects of several factors, including GA to MD ratio, total solids content of emulsion, wall to core ratio, and inlet air temperature, on the microencapsulation efficiency (ME) were investigated. The optimization of operation conditions was realized by response surface methodology (RSM). The optimal conditions were as follows: GA to MD ratio 2.38, total solids content 39%, wall to core ratio 5.33, and inlet air temperature 154°C. Under the optimal conditions, the ME of SBPO microcapsules was 94.96 ± 1.42%. The physicochemical properties of microcapsules were also invested. SBPO microcapsules obtained had low water activity, low moisture content, high water solubility, and high bulk density. For the morphological characteristics, cracks and pores were not observed in most microcapsules, which was beneficial for the protection of ingredients in microcapsules. The particle size of SBPO microcapsules ranged from 0.01 to 5 μm, and the mean diameter

  <sub>4,3</sub> was 2.55 μm. The analysis results of fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) informed the presence of SBPO in microcapsules. There were no significant differences in the content of the main fatty acids in SBPO before and after spray drying. The results of oxidative stability showed that the microencapsulation by spray drying could effectively protect SBPO from oxidation and extend the shelf life of SBPO.
