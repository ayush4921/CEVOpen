 <p>Spray‚Äêdrying technology was used to encapsulate sea buckthorn (
  <italic>Hippophae rhamnoides</italic> L.) pulp oil, and the effects of main factors were investigated. As well as, the physical properties of microcapsules including water activity, moisture content, solubility, hygroscopicity, morphology, and particle size were also studied. Under the optimal conditions, the microencapsulation efficiency and qualities of microcapsules were satisfactory.
