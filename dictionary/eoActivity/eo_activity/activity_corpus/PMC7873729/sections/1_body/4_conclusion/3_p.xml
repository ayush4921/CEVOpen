<p id="p0200">This is the first study documenting the traditional uses based on herbal medicine for thyroid management in Algeria. The obtained results reveal an important local knowledge along with a variety and a large number of aromatic and medicinal plants used in Algerian traditional medicine to treat thyroid disorders. Overall, informants have described 63 medicinal plants belonging to 59 genera and 34 families. The most represented botanical families were Lamiaceae, Fabaceae, Apiaceae, Amaranthaceae and Asteraceae respectively. However, the most cited plant species were 
 <italic>Atriplex halimus</italic> L., 
 <italic>Bunium incrassatum</italic> (Boiss.) Amo, 
 <italic>Nigella sativa</italic> L., 
 <italic>Aquilaria malaccensis</italic> Lam. and 
 <italic>Saussurea costus</italic> (Falc.) Lipsch. Evidently, it is the time to increase effective scientific studies on mechanisms of action of these medicinal plants in order to validate their popular usages.
