<p id="p0100">Honey was widely cited by the informants in the present study (FC = 57). It was used as additive to prepare mixtures based on more than one ingredient. Informants have preconized mainly that of 
 <italic>Ziziphus lotus</italic> flowers but most of them have stated that any pure honey could be of interest if this later is not available. Honey was administered fresh or in infusion, alone or in combination with the other natural products from different origins. In addition, informants have reported the use of milk and butter of goat (FC = 5 and 13 respectively), olive oil (FC = 5) and Yoghurt (FC = 2). Informants believe that these additives are able to enhance healing, improve the taste and reduce side effects of the herbal medicine.
