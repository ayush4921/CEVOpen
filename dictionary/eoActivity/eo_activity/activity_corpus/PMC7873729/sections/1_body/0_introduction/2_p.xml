<p id="p0005">The thyroid glandÂ is an important butterfly-shaped organ of the human endocrine system. This soft and reddish parenchymal organ secretes thyroxine (T4) and tri-iodothyronine (T3) which play critical roles in the regulation of basal metabolism processes indispensable for normal growth and development (

The T4 is deiodinated to T3 in the periphery. It should be noted that the thyroid produces all the circulating T4 but only 5 to 10% of circulating T3 while the rest is being derived from peripheral monodeiodination of T4 by the type I deiodinase in tissues such as heart, liver, kidney, and gut mucosa. However, the type II deiodinase provides intracellular T3 in specific sites such as central nervous system and pituitary gland (

Throughout the activation of specific genes, these hormones stimulate proteo-synthesis, promote nervous system development, and regulate oxygen metabolism and calcium homeostasis (

On the other side, TSH level is regulated by the hypothalamus and further controlling mechanisms producing a feedback loop closed by the action of T4 and T3 on the pituitary gland (
