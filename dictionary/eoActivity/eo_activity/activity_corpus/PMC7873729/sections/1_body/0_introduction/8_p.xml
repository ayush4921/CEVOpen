<p id="p0035">The current study aims to document the ethnopharmacological relevance of medicinal plants used traditionally for the management of thyroid disorders in Algeria. The obtained data are thought to enrich national and worldâ€™s databases of traditional knowledge and safeguard the cultural heritage as recognized by the UNESCO in 2003. Up to knowledge of authors, this study represents the first ethnopharmacological investigation carried out on thyroid disorders management in Algeria and therefore, it might constitute the basis for further studies seeking for eco-friendly green drug discovery.</p>
