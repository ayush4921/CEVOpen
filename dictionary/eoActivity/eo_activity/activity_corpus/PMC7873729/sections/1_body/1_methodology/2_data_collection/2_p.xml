<p id="p0040">Ethnopharmacological study was conducted through field studies achieved during two years from June 2017 to July 2019. The study was engaged in eleven different locations in Algeria i.e. Adrar, Aflou, Chlef, Laghouat, Mila, Mostaghanem, Oran, Ouargla, Relizane, Tiaret and Tissemsilt reflecting both, the traditional and the modern regions encompassing both modern Western-style healthcare and traditional, culture-based healthcare. The regions covered in this study are characterized by their ecological and climatic diversity reflecting the most characteristic ecosystems of the country including the coasts, mountains, forests, arid high plains, steppe and Sahara. These various ecosystems shelter significant faunistic and floristic biodiversity of international importance as defined by the Ramsar Convention.
