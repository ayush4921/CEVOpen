 <italic>Bunium incrassatum</italic> (Boiss.) Batt. &amp; Trab. is an economically important endemic medicinal plant in the north of Algeria (
 <xref rid="b0280" ref-type="bibr">Quezel and Santa, 1963</xref>). This plant has a long history in Algeria since it contributed to save many Algerian populations from starvation during the French colonization where people resorted to dry and ground the harvested tubers of this plant to prepare bread and couscous. The dried powder of its tubers is usually used as astringent, anti-diarrheal, anti-inflammatory as well as for bronchitis and cough treatments in local traditional medicine. This species has been widely reported throughout the present study for the management of both hyper and hypothyroidism. Essential oils and extracts from some 
 <italic>Bunium</italic> spp. have revealed a potent antioxidant activity (
 <xref rid="b0310" ref-type="bibr">Shahsavari et al., 2008</xref>) but there is still insufficient data about its phytochemical composition and its use in Algeria and worldwide. At this point the study could offer valuable information for the use and valorization of such neglected genetic resources. Thereby, phytochemical studies of 
 <italic>Bunium microcarpum</italic> (Boiss.) Freyn &amp; Bornm., 
 <italic>B. brachyactis</italic> (Post) H. Wolff and 
 <italic>B. pinnatifolium</italic> Kljuykov have revealed the presence of apigenin, chlorogenic acid, isoquercitrin, rutin, pantothenic acid, esculin, quinic acid, scopoletin, coumarins, monoterppenoids and sesquiterpenes. However, the presence of angelicin, diosmin, vitexin, cosmosiin, luteolin, salcolin B, vicenin-2, naringenin, afzelin, kaempferol and orientin was species dependent (
