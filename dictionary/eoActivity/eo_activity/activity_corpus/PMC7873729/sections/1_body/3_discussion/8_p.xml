<p id="p0140">Practically the majority of participants have informed the use 
 <italic>Atriplex halimus</italic> L. as anti-hyperthyroid while others reported its use as anti-hypothyroid however, almost all the informants have cited its potent use for thyroid cysts treatment. The phytochemical studies of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>halimus</italic> have demonstrated that it contains up 10% sodium chloride along with several active compounds such as phenolic acids, flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins, saponins and resins acting as potent reducing agents and singlet oxygen quenchers (

 <italic>A. halimus</italic> while 
 <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">Clauser et al. (2013)</xref> have isolated other four new glycosylated flavonoids along with other known phenolic compounds. Almost all of these molecules, mainly flavonoids glycosides, are known by their anti-hyperthyroid activity since they are able to inhibit the synthesis of thyroid hormones by acting as alternative substrates for the key enzyme in thyroid hormones biosynthesis thyroperoxidase (TPO), and therefore to a rise in TSH levels in male Sprague–Dawley rat treated by 50 mg/kg quercetin during 14 days (
