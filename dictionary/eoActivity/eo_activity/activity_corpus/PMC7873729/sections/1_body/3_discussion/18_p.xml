<p id="p0190">It is important to know that traditional medicines are not free of side effects and many substances might induce health problems if dosage and method of administration are inappropriate (
 <xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">Izzo et al., 2016</xref>). Despite their therapeutical properties, some of the reported plant species are toxic at higher doses and thus are not recommended for patients i.e. 
 <italic>Peganum harmala</italic> L., 
 <italic>Artemisia herba-alba</italic> Asso
 <italic>, Berberis vulgaris</italic> L., 
 <italic>Crocus sativus</italic> L.
 <italic>, Haloxylon scoparium</italic> Pomel
 <italic>, Juniperus phoenicea</italic> L.

 <italic>, Lepidium sativum</italic> L.
 <italic>, Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> L. (

 <italic>Prunus</italic> spp. rich with glycosides, cyanogen and amygdaline might cause weakness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and spasms followed by terminal coma and death due to cyanide poisoning at higher doses (
 <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">Chaouali et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, patients must have sufficient information about their preparation, dosage and toxicity. In fact, ethnopharmacological studies are not only appreciated for conservation of traditional knowledge and resources but also valuable for the populationâ€™s healthcare and drug discovery (
