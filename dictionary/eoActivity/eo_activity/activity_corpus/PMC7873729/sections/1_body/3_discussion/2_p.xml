<p id="p0110">Ethnopharmacological studies constitute a less expensive way of finding natural drug candidates for several diseases. The search for natural hormone analogs in medicinal plants to substitute synthetic compounds is extremely promising. Several molecules from medicinal plants have been described as modulators of nuclear receptors (
 <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2012</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0255" ref-type="bibr">Ong and Tan, 2007</xref>) including thyroid hormone receptors (
 <xref rid="b0290" ref-type="bibr">Reis et al., 2018</xref>). The target medicinal plants molecules should not be only hormones analogs, but also further similar compounds capable to modulate existing nuclear receptors (such as ligands, agonists, antagonists, co-activators, co-repressors, and responsive elements) since transcription factors control practically the whole genetic activity and subsequently the corresponding physiology. In addition, 
 <xref rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al. (2007)</xref> have reported that the innumerable molecules contained in plant extracts might act synergistically in modulating nuclear receptors. 
 <xref rid="b0255" ref-type="bibr">Ong and Tan (2007)</xref> have described also that plant extracts are able to enhance the nuclear receptor activity through binding outside the hormone pocket, even when the receptor is saturated with endogenous ligands.
