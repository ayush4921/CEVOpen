<p id="p0120">In general, 63 medicinal plant species have been reported traditionally used for thyroid disorders management in Algeria. The reported plant diversity was distributed within 34 families and 59 genera. Lamiaceae, Fabaceae and Apiaceae were respectively the most represented families. The prevalence of these plant families is well known in the Algerian medicinal flora (

However, the respective frequent used parts were seeds (17%), tubers (14%), roots (11%), bark and bulbs (7%) which means that the underground plant parts represent almost 40% of the total. Probably, their use is due to their richness with bioactive ingredients (
