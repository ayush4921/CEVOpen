    "Nigella sativa (N. sativa) is extensively used as medicinal plant all over the world. It has the potential properties as the antiviral and antibacterial application. Its seed contain thymoquinone (TQ), thymohydroquinone (THQ), thymol (THY), p-cymene as major and other minor components. TQ and THQ exhibit broad spectrum of antimicrobial properties against the activity of bacteria, viruses, parasites, schistosoma and fungi. This work provides credence to the fabrication of antibacterial nanofibrous membrane by electrospinning machine from N. sativa extract with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution for wound dressing. The morphology of the developed membrane is also characterized using scanning electron microscope. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) data has been showed that the functional groups of N. sativa are present in the prepared PVA-N. sativa nanofibrous membrane and its antibacterial activity was investigated. The disk diffusion method has been used to evaluate the antibacterial activity of PVA-N. sativa nanofibrous membrane against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) bacteria and the inhibition zone with a value of 10Â mm is formed. Considering the inherent properties of N. sativa, a conceptual reaction mechanism has been proposed to deactivate the viral proteins by the action of TQ and THQ."
