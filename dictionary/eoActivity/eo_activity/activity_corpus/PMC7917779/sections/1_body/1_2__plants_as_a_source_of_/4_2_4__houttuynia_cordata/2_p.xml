 <italic>Houttuynia cordata</italic> showed significant inhibition on SARS-CoV. The 
 <italic>Houttuynia cordata</italic> (HC) extract successfully inhibited the SARS-CoV3C such as protease (3CLpro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) [

 <italic>Houttuynia cordata</italic> extract was non-toxic to animal models at an oral administration dose of 16 g/kg. Through flow cytometric analysis, Lau et al. [
 <xref rid="B52-medicina-57-00169" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] showed that 
 <italic>Houttuynia cordata</italic> extract in mice model significantly increases the CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with a significant increase in the secretion of IL-2 and IL-10 cytokine in mouse splenic lymphocytes.
