<p>Ethanolic extract of the stem cortex of the plant successfully inhibited the SARS-CoV. [
 <xref rid="B57-medicina-57-00169" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The active component that probably inhibited the SARS-CoV was lycorine (C16H17NO4), which was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Although the mechanism of action of lycorine on the SARS-CoV is still unclear, it has shown promising results as an antiviral. Li et al. [
 <xref rid="B57-medicina-57-00169" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] also showed that commercially available lycorine inhibited the SARS-CoV.
