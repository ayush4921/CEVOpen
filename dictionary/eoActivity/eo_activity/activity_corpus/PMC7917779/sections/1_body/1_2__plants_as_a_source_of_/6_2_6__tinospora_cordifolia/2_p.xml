<p>The stem extract of 
 <italic>Tinospora cordifolia</italic> has antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral properties. The stem extract of 
 <italic>Tinospora cordifolia</italic> successfully inhibited the herpes simplex virus by 61.43% in the Vero cell line [

 <xref rid="B60-medicina-57-00169" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] showed that 60% of the patients who received 
 <italic>Tinospora cordifolia</italic> extract and 20% on placebo showed a decrease in the incidence of various symptoms associated with HIV. However, they did not study all the parameters but hypothesized that 
 <italic>Tinospora cordifolia</italic> extract could be used as an adjunct to HIV management. The in silico approach against SARS-CoV-2 was tested by Sagar and Kumar [
 <xref rid="B61-medicina-57-00169" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The key targets they considered for the docking were surface glycoprotein, receptor-binding domain, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and protease. The natural compounds from 
 <italic>Tinospora cordifolia</italic> such as berberine, isocolumbin, magnoflorine, and tinocordiside showed high binding efficacy against all four key targets [
