 <italic>Lycoris radiata</italic>, which is commonly known as red spider lily, hell flower, red magic lily, or sometimes called equinox flower, belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae. 
 <italic>Lycoris radiata</italic> has shown its effect against H5N1 [
 <xref rid="B53-medicina-57-00169" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Lycorine the active component of 
 <italic>Lycoris radiata</italic> successfully inhibited the influenza virus, which is responsible for avian influenza infection [
 <xref rid="B54-medicina-57-00169" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Proteomic analysis revealed that lycorine alters protein expression in avian influenza virus-infected cells and the treatment with lycorine also decreased the levels of nuclear pore complex protein 93(Nup93, E2RSV7), which is a part of nuclear-cytoplasmic transport [

 <italic>Lycoris radiata</italic> have also shown the anti-hepatitis C virus activity [
 <xref rid="B55-medicina-57-00169" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Furthermore, it has also been observed that Lycorocidine derivates possess inhibitory activity against the tobacco mosaic virus [
