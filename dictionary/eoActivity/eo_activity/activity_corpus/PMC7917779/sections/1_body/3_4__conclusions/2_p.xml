<p>This review is based on the treatments given in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS, which could also be effective against SARS-CoV-2 since SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV and have 80% sequence identical [

Plants are a good source of natural medication and an alternative to antibiotic treatment because the excessive use of antibiotics is responsible for drug resistance. Secondly, the main advantage of using plants is that they are economically efficient, have high scalability and safety because the plants can be cultivated in a very low amount, and they also do not support the growth of human pathogens [

Medicinal plants may be a good source of antivirals, but the accurate dosage and plant parts that have medicinal properties, such as root, shoot, etc., should be known prior to the consumption; otherwise, the adverse effect could also exist. Although the exact mechanism of action of plants on to the virus is still unknown, we are of opinion that healthy food helps in boosting the immune system, which further prevents disease including SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, a nutritious diet that includes different vitamins, minerals should be consumed regularly.
