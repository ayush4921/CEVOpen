<p id="p0115">EPS is a physical important barrier for bacteria which helps to produce DNA, nucleic acid, extra cellular leakage materials for adhesion, protection and prevention of bacteria from external antibiotics (

 <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">Maruthupandy et al. (2020)</xref>, purified plant EO has the EPS ability through capsular polysachharide, which is dangerous for biofilm formation in human. The proposed mechanism was agreed by previous report of 
 <xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">Vaillancourt et al. (2018)</xref>. Inhibition of EPS was major key factor to eradicate complete biofilm formation, because it lost the production of extracellular polysachharide and damaged binding site modification (
