<p id="p0095">The preparative HPLC method was used to purify the active anti-bacterial EOs fraction, and the purified fraction was scanned by analytical HPLC. Based on the retention time, percentages of area and percentages of height, 9 different compound peaks (fractions) were identified from the purified essential oil. All the peaks and their retention time, occupation, height and area percentage of analytical HPLC result was inserted in table format (
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Among the 9 AEOF, fractions 2 and 4 exhibited 16 and 24 mm zone of inhibition against CRBF 
 <italic>K. pneumonia</italic> at 35 μg/mL was observed (
 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>b, c). These two fraction peaks occupied the most of the area and height percentages was 5,793,629, 4,955,624 and 15.479, 28.838 observed respectively. These were comparatively very high than other fraction peaks. These two fractions were further purified separately by preparative HPLC using same mobile phase, retention, flow rate, temperature and fraction time. It was confirmed by analytical HPLC. Both the peaks and their retention time, occupation, height and area percentage of analytical HPLC result was inserted in table format (
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Finally, both the fractions were mixed together and exhibited 30 mm zone of inhibition at 35 μg/mL was observed (
 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>d). The differentiation between all the purified fractions was available in 
 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>a. This purification result also suggests, the EO was surrounded with some bioactive compounds constituents that present inside of the essential oil. Therefore, the present result confirmed that the plant 
 <italic>H. rosa-sinensis</italic> could play an effective role against biofilm producing CRBF 
 <italic>K. pneumonia.</italic>
