 <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">Kartinah et al., 2019</xref>, also, excellent anti-bacterial compounds were also present in the purified extract. Some reports identified the MIC of bioactive compound from plant purified compound has high concentration. In the present study, the tested range was minimum 10 µg/mL and maximum 50 µg/mL with excellent anti-bacterial activity against BF 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>. Recently, 
 <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">Lingesh et al. (2018)</xref>, reported that the 
 <italic>H. rosa-sinensis</italic> essential oil has excellent anti-bacterial activity against MDR of GNB by different environmental factors such as temperature, pH, NaCL and other stresses. Previously, cineole, β-biotol, α-atlantone, α-terpiniol has excellent anti-bacterial activity when compared with bioactive compound (
 <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">Gandhi et al., 2019</xref>). Mechanistically, anti-bacterial activity of some petals mediated compounds have more capacity to elevate the permeability to fat soluble compounds, while the bioactive compound constituents were also present highly in inside of the essential oil with low efficiency. They may play active role in inside of the bacterial that leads to cell wall damage, QS inhibition, enzyme alteration and biofilm inhibition activity (
