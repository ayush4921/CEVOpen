<p id="p0120">Further, the CRA plate method result was also confirmed that the AEOF has excellent bacteriostatic effect. In result, control plate of untreated BF 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> exhibited black color colonies, whereas treated plates exhibited loss of black color and no black color colonies (
 <xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>a-inset figure). At 90 μg/mL concentration, bacteria lost their complete EPS production was observed when compared with any other concentration. It indicates, the AEOF did not allow developing the bacterial virulence factors in inside of the bacteria. At half inhibition concentration of 60 μg/mL may start their function against DNA replication, nucleic acid synthesis and EPS secretion. In addition, surface charges of antigenicity were more sensitive to external antibiotics (
