<p id="p0110">Further, aliquot the evaluated result of XTT in MHA plates also proved that the AEOF has excellent bacteriostatic effect (
 <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>b-Inset figures). The colonies of MHA plates were shown with distribution at 10 μg/mL. There was no colony at 90 μg/mL also when compared with control. Both XTT and MHA plate results proved that the AEOF has anti-biofilm activity due to the reduction of metabolic activity. Our result was agreed by

 <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">Francesco et al. (2011)</xref>, also reported that the EO disrupted the antigenicity of protein and alters the DNA replication due to the arrest of formazan production. Hence, the indirect and direct method of AEOF results were indicated that the significant reduction on metabolic activity of selected biofilm producing
