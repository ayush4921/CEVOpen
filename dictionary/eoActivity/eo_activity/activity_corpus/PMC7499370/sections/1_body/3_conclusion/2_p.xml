<p id="p0135">In this research, the purified HPLC fraction of 
 <italic>H. rosa-sinensis</italic> EO shows enhanced anti-biofilm activity against BF 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>. All the invitro experiments showed that the oil exhibited excellent activity over BF 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae.</italic> Microscopical images of SEM indicated that the EO altered the bacterial replication and internal structure due to the interference of exopolysaccharide layer damage. Also, the structural and shape arrangement was entirely modified at very low concentration. From the identified results, we confirm that the 
 <italic>H. rosa-sinensis</italic> EO could be acted as a promising anti-biofilm agent for BF 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae.</italic>
