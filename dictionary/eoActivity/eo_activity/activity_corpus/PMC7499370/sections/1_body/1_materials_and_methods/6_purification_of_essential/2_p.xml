<p id="p0045">Anti-bacterial effect of the EO was measured by analytical HPLC for detection of active EO fraction (AEOF). The mobile phase of acetonitrile:methanol:ammonium acetate:water (45:10:10:35) was used for purify the EOs. After, all essential oil fractions were purified separately using preparative HPLC. The agar well diffusion method was used to detect the purified EOs fraction at 37 °C for 24 h. Whereas, third generation chaphalosporin chephalosporin piperacillin/tazobactam and methanol was served as a positive and negative control respectively. Finally, active essential oil fraction (AEOF) was separated by preparative HPLC and proved by analytical HPLC followed by lyophilization at 40 °C for study. The instrument of preparatory HPLC was set up with 150 mm × 4.6 mm of C18 column, linear gradient of 4.6 µm and 1 mL/min flow rate was used. The temperature of 0–10 min with 10–90% A, 90–100% B and 100% C at 10–11 min, 11–20 min and 15–25 min were maintained in gradient elution program. The 20 µL column injected volume at 40 °C temperature was used (
