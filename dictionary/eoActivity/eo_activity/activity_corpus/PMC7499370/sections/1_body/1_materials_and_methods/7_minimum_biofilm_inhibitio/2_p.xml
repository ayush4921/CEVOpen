<p id="p0050">The biofilm eradication of BF 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> at different concentration of AEOF was identified by crystal violet staining assay with some modification (
 <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">Jardak et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 μg/mL of EOs was added into previously filled TSB containing 24-well polystyrene plate and subsequently inoculated 100 μg/mL of 10
 <sup>-5</sup> bacterial suspension at 37 °C for 24 h. After incubation, the discarded 24-well plate was rinsed thoroughly with PBS, followed by 0.5% crystal violet solution at 5 min. Next, unstained cells were washed to discard by PBS and solubilized with 2 mL of ethanol and quantified by O.D at 540 nm. Untreated bacterial culture containing well acted as a control.
