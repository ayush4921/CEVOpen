<p id="p0040">Anti-bacterial activity of the purified EO was evaluated against selected BF 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> by agar well diffusion method (
 <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">Ebani et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, the 24 h old BF 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> culture was spread on the muller hinton agar plate (MHA). The wells were cut by using sterile gel borer and different concentration 10, 25, 50 μL of EO was added into the well. Whereas, 10 μL of methanol and third generation cephalosporin ceftazidime was served as a positive controls and methanol added well was acted as a negative control at 37 °C for 24 h. After incubation, the zone of inhibition around the wells was noted in diameter and the experiment was conducted in triplicate.
