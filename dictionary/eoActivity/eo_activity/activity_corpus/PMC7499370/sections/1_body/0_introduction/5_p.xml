<p id="p0020">The seeds of the HRS are mostly used for oil production in many countries, and phytochemical compositions of the oils are applied in various biological process. In the daily meals of West Africa, the HRS leaves and powders are used frequently (

In addition, the more polysaccharide composition of the HRS as a format of secretory idioblasts oil or mucilage, which were associated with the parenchyma of HRS. Plant mucilages are complex polysaccharide polymers, it has high molecular weight. All the mucilages are either acidic or neutral polysaccharides (

Eos has very low toxicity compared with other phytochemical compounds and also, it damaged the bacterial cell wall through hydrophobic channels. Finally, it could enter the inside of the cells and destroy the cell cycle process and cytoplasmic leakages materials (
