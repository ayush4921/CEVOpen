<p id="Par40">Compared to the control rats, MIA’s intra-articular injection caused a significant reduction of paw withdrawal latencies to heat stimuli (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). Statistical analysis showed that the difference between the CO and OA groups on days 4, 7, and 14 after the injection is significant (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). All treatments significantly increased the withdrawal latency compared to the osteoarthritis group (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). Also, the data analysis showed that the anti-nociceptive effect of nanoemulsion was higher than essential oil gel (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05), and the difference between the NG and DG groups was not significant (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.09).
