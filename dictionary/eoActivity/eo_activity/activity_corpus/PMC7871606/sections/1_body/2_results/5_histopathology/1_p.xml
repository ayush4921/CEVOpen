 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. The control rats that received intra-articular saline showed no change in the knee joint after 14 days, i.e., the articular tissue structures, including the synovial tissue, synovium, adjacent ligaments, tendons, and tendon sheath, and subcutaneous tissues, had typical tissue architecture. Chronic inflammatory reactions accompanied by tendon adhesion were observed in the MIA injected animals. Also, the formation of granulation tissue with neovascularization, edema, infiltration of mononuclear was noticed. Moreover, chondrocyte necrosis with loss of matrix caused a decrease in the articular cartilage thickness and led to the separation of the necrotic cartilage from the subchondral bone. In the NG and DG animals, inflammatory cell infiltration and cartilage injury significantly declined. In both groups’ animals, a few scattered mononuclear cells were observed, and the cartilage thickness increased compared to the OA group (Figs.
