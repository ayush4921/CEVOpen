<p id="Par33">The oxidative stress parameters were evaluated in tissue homogenates. Briefly, 0.2–0.3 g of each tissue sample was homogenate with ice-cooled KCl (150 mM), and then the mixture was centrifuged (3000 g for 10 min). Determining lipid peroxidation, the MDA content of the sample was measured using thiobarbituric acid (TBA) reaction as follows: 0.5 ml of homogenate supernatant was mixed with 1 ml trichloroacetic acid (20%) and centrifuged at 2500 g for 10 min, and then 1 ml of TBA 0.067% was added to the sample (0.5 ml of centrifuged solution). The reaction solution was heated 80 for 15 min and then chilled in Ice. The absorbance of the solution was measured spectrophotometrically at 532 nm. The amount of MDA was expressed as nmol/mg protein [
