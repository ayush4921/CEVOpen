<p id="Par30">Paw withdrawal latency in response to radiant heat was measured using the plantar test apparatus (UgoBasile, Varese, Italy). Rats were placed within plexiglass on a transparent glass floor. An infrared ray that constitutes the heat source was moved under the mid-plantar surface of the hind paw (temperature: 52 °C). The latency (seconds) between the heat stimulus onset and paw withdrawal was defined as thermal withdrawal latency. A cut-off time of 22 s was considered to avoid tissue damage. Each paw was tested three times with inter-stimulus intervals. Mean withdrawal latency time for ipsilateral (injected), and contralateral paw was calculated separately [
