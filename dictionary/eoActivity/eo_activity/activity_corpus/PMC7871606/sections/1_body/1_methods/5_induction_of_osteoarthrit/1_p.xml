<p id="Par26">Evaluating the anti-nociceptive effects of the nanoemulsion, osteoarthritis was induced by intra-articular injection of monosodium iodoacetate (MIA). Briefly, rats were anesthetized with Ketamine-Xylazine (100–10 mg/kg, I.P.) (Alfasan, The Netherlands) and 2 mg of MIA (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) dissolved in 25 μl sterile normal saline was injected into the left knee joint with a 27-gauge needle inserted through the intra-patellar tendon. Control animals were given a single injection of the vehicle into the left knee joint [

 <italic>n</italic> = 6 for each) including Control (CO), Osteoarthritis (OA), Osteoarthritis received gel contained the nanoemulsion (NG), Osteoarthritis received gel contained Mentha and Rosemary essential oils (EG), Osteoarthritis received the nanoemulsion solution (NS), and Osteoarthritis received gel contained 1% diclofenac sodium (Razak Co., Iran) (DG). Gels and solutions were topically applied at a dose of 1 ml on injected knee daily for 14 days.
