<p id="Par28">Mechanical allodynia was evaluated by measuring the hind paw withdrawal response to von-Frey filament stimulation (with increasing forces ranging from 2 to 60 g, Stoelting Inc., Wood Dale, IL). Rats were placed in a plexiglass cage with a mesh floor and allowed to acclimate for 15 min or until exploratory behavior ceased. Filaments were applied at a 90° to the mild plantar of the rat’s left hind paw (ipsilateral side of MIA injection). The stimulation was used three times consecutively by pushing down on the hind paw until the rat withdrew its paw or the fiber bowed. Lifting the paw due to normal locomotor behavior was ignored. The smallest filament size, which evoked at least two withdrawal responses during three consecutive applications, was considered as the withdrawal threshold. Each filament was applied approximately 1 s, and intervals between each stimulation were about 1 min [
