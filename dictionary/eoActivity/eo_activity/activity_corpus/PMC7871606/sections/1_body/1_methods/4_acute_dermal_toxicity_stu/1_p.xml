<p id="Par25">Acute dermal toxicity test was performed following the guideline of OECD number 402 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This study was done on two groups of animals: control and nanoemulsion receiving groups. Each group included three male and three female rats were kept individually. Approximately 24 h before the test, fur was removed from the trunk’s dorsal area with an electrical clipper. Care was taken to avoid irritating the skin, and only rats with intact skin were used. A dose of 2000 mg of the nanoemulsion was applied to 10% of animals’ body surface area and covered with gauze patch and fixed with cloth glue for 24 h. The residual test substance was removed after the exposure period. Then, animals’ skin was studied at 30 min and 1, 2, and 4 h(s) for edema, erythema, and any other types of dermal change. Animals were kept under observation for any changes in the skin, eyes, mucus membranes, behavior patterns, diarrhea, salivation, tremor, and mortality for 14 days post-exposure. Body weight was recorded on days 0 (before treatment), 7, and 14. At the end of the study, animals were anesthetized and sacrificed for blood sampling. Biochemical and hematological parameters were detected.
