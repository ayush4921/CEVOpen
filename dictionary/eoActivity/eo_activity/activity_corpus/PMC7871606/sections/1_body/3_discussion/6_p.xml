<p id="Par51">One of this study’s future aims was to evaluate the nanoemulsion’s efficacy in patients with osteoarthritis. We loaded the nanoemulsion in a gel formulation to easily use and control the drug’s applied amount. To investigate gel formulation’s effect on the nanoemulsion efficacy, we added the NS group to the study groups. Our results demonstrated the difference between NG and NS group was not significant in none of the tests. We can conclude that the formulation of the nanoemulsion in the gel doesn’t change the effect of nanoemulsion on behavioral, biochemical, and histopathologic parameters.</p>
