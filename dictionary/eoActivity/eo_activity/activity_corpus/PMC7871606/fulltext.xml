The main complaint of patients is debilitating pain, which influences their quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and it gradually becomes more resistant to treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Since no disease-modifying drugs are available, treatments&#x02019; main goals are symptomatic such as analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Although these treatments effectively reduce pain, inflammation, and symptoms of the OA, but do not have a significant impact on the prevention of the disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Knowledge in herbal medicine and its use has increased in recent years due to higher safety and a reasonable price. The effect of the various herbs on osteoarthritis treatment and prevention has been investigated.</p><p id="Par16"><italic>Mentha piperita</italic> (peppermint), a natural hybrid between <italic>Mentha spicata</italic> and <italic>Mentha aquatica</italic>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] contains about 1.2&#x02013;1.5% of essential oil, and menthol, as its main active ingredient, has various therapeutic effects such as anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-bacterial, anti-cancer, and analgesic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Taher has revealed that peppermint can reduce the writhing number induced by acetic acid injection in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Using acetic acid-induced nociception and carrageenan-induced paw edema tests, Kehili et al. have proved the anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects of peppermint essential oil in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Also, Belemkar and colleagues have shown analgesic effects of <italic>Mentha piperita</italic> methanolic extract by both the hot-plate and tail immersion tests in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A study showed that topical application of a cream containing <italic>Mentha piperita</italic>, <italic>Cinnamomum camphora</italic>, and <italic>Pinus roxburghii</italic> essential oil reduces pain and swelling in patients with osteoarthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">In traditional medicine, <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> L. (rosemary) uses as a treatment for asthma, renal colic pain, and dysmenorrhea. The main components isolated from rosemary essential oil monoterpenes have anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-nociceptive effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Raskovic et al. have demonstrated that rosemary essential oil can alleviate pain in the hot-plate test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Also, Belkhodja et al. have studied the effect of rosemary and white poplar essential oils in an animal model of knee osteoarthritis. Radiographic and histologic data of this study have shown that the essential oil has a protective effect against osteoarthritis in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Ghasemzadeh and colleagues have evaluated the anti-allodynic and anti-hyperalgesic effects of rosemary extract in rats with neuropathic pain. This study also has demonstrated that rosemary extract has anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects that can treat neuropathic injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Besides, an in vitro study on bovine articular cartilage cells has revealed that rosemary extract slows down cartilage degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Despite the medicinal properties of essential oils, some factors such as volatility, sensitivity to light and oxygen, and hydrophobicity have restricted the use of essential oils in pharmaceutical formulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Nanoemulsion-based delivery systems are favorite methods for improving the stability, decreasing volatility, and enhancing water solubility of the essential oils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The nanoemulsification of essential oils can increase their stability and improve antimicrobial efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Nanoemulsions are transparent and thermodynamically stable dispersion of oil and water balanced by an interfacial layer of surfactant and co-surfactant molecules. The droplet size in nanoemulsion is approximately 10&#x02013;200&#x02009;nm. The tiny size of nanoemulsion droplet provided greater surface area, enhancing skin absorption and making these systems suitable for transdermal delivery. The nanoemulsion improved the bioavailability of the drug and increased the solubility of the lipophilic agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">Due to the medicinal properties of peppermint and rosemary essential oils and their limitations as a drug, the present study aimed to evaluate the effect of nanoemulsion containing rosemary and peppermint essential oils in a rat model of osteoarthritis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Nanoemulsion preparation</title><p id="Par20">Rosemary and peppermint essential oils were purchased from the Barij-Essence pharmaceutical company (Kashan, Iran). A spontaneous emulsification technique was used to make the nanoemulsion. To achieve the best formulation for a stable nanoemulsion, various ratios of emulsifiers and essential oils were examined (results not published). The results showed that the best ratio for emulsifiers is 1: 1: 3 for crudert, tween 20 and tween 80, respectively. Also, the optimum ratio of propylene glycol and polyethylene glycol 400 as co-solvent was obtained 1:2. To prepare nanoemulsion, the aqueous phase was assisted by solvents and water, and an oily phase consisting of emulsifiers and essential oils were prepared separately. The beaker was sealed with parafilm and placed into bain-marie at 35&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. In the next step, the aqueous phase was added dropwise to the oil phase, which was placed in a hot water bath on a heater stirrer (37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, 200 RPM).

Comparing the lipid profile in the CO and NG groups showed that the nanoemulsion did not alter the lipid profile. Also, serum levels of the NG group&#x02019;s aminotransferase enzymes, as markers of liver function, did not significantly change compared to the controls. Besides, no change in serum creatinine and urea after receiving the nanoemulsion indicated the animal&#x02019;s kidney&#x02019;s normal activity. The examination of hematologic factors showed that the nanoemulsion did not cause blood cell death and did not alter erythrocyte parameters such as hemoglobin and hematocrit. Based on our knowledge, there is no study to evaluate the effect of acute dermal treatment of a nanoemulsion on the hematological and biochemical parameters in an animal model. However, the Ribeiro et al. study has shown that oral administration of nanoemulsion containing <italic>Eucalyptus staigeriana</italic> essential oil did not alter the rats&#x02019; hematological parameters after the treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Ragavan and colleagues have shown that acute oral treatment of garlic oil nanoemulsion did not change renal markers such as urea and creatinine and hematologic factors of rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Also, we did not observe any dermal reactions after applying the nanoemulsion gel on the rabbit skin. Researchers have shown that nanoemulsion containing natural origin drugs had no dermal toxicity and can lead to better interaction with the skin and enhance skin penetration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Mou et al. have demonstrated that nanoencapsulation of menthol and camphor provides better interaction with the skin and permeation enhancing ability and might be a promising carrier for topical drug delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Furthermore, Sugumar and colleagues made a nanoemulsion containing eucalyptus oil, which had no irritancy and improved the wound healing process than the neomycin treated rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par47">In the second part of the study, we induced osteoarthritis by intra-articular injection of MIA to evaluate the nanoemulsion&#x02019;s analgesic effect. Previous studies showed that MIA injection into the knee joint causes chondrocyte apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], which results in an imbalance in the extracellular matrix and cartilage damage leading to the OA progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The MIA injection to the joint leads to the release of peripheral pro-inflammatory mediators and neuropeptides such as prostaglandins, substance P, and bradykinin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. This inflammatory response can induce sensitization of the nociceptive receptor and hyperactivates the pain pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Our results showed that all the treatments improve the cartilage change induced by MIA injection and reduce the joint pain. Also, the nanoemulsion and diclofenac, an analgesic and anti-inflammatory drug for relieving pain in many inflammatory diseases were more efficient.</p><p id="Par48">Studies have previously shown that rosemary and peppermint essential oils have an analgesic effect. Ghannadi et al. demonstrated that combined rosemary and lavender essential oil ointment reduces pain and improves physical function in patients with knee osteoarthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Another study showed that rosemary essential oil inhibits pain during both neurogenic and inflammatory phases of the formalin test, reduces the number of acetic acid-induced writhing, and inhibits the edema formation after carrageenan injection in the rat paw edema test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Atta and Alkofahi have confirmed the anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects of peppermint. Their results demonstrated that peppermint could delay the reaction time to the hot-plate-induced thermal stimulation and inhibit acetic acid-induced writhing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. These findings were consistent with another study showing that the peppermint leaf extract has significant analgesic effects against thermal stimulation and writhing tests in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The more reducing pain in the NS in comparison to the EG group can be attributed to the small size of nano-droplets. Also, polyethylene glycol in nanoemulsion structure can bind to the active ingredients and results in their controlled release. Moreover, the presence of tween 20 and tween 80 in its structure reduces the surface tension between the nanoemulsion&#x02019;s components and water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p id="Par49">Previous studies have indicated the role of oxidative stress and inflammatory reactions in degenerative processes in OA. Jiang et al. demonstrated that chondrocytes apoptosis is mitochondrial-dependent and related to reactive oxygen species (ROS) elevation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Ashkavand et al. reported that the pro-inflammatory mediators such as interleukin 1-B and nitric oxide elevates in animals received MIA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Their results also showed that MDA content in the articular tissue increases, indicating that lipid peroxidation increases after pro-inflammatory mediators elevation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The SOD activity is representing the ability of the body to scavenge free radicals. Gan et al. have demonstrated that the SOD activity positively correlates with the severity of damage in osteoarthritis disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Our results are inconsistent with previous studies. All applied intervention significantly decreased the MDA level and increased SOD and GPx activity compared to the OA group. Based on our knowledge, although no study evaluates the antioxidant effect of peppermint and rosemary essential oils in osteoarthritis, it has been previously proven in the other disorders. For example, Khalil et al. have shown that peppermint essential oil decreases the MDA and increases the activity of SOD and GSH in the liver exposed to CCL4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Also, Roskovic et al. have reported that rosemary essential oil can normalize the elevated MDA amount and reverse the oxidative stress-related enzymes in rats receiving CCL4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Furthermore, Hussein and colleagues have demonstrated that nanoencapsulation increased the rosemary essential oil&#x02019;s stability and antioxidant activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p id="Par50">In line with our results, Belkhodja et al. have shown that the rosemary essential oil reduces osteoarthritis histological score in rats with MIA injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Their results have demonstrated that although rosemary decreases the degradation of articular cartilage and inflammation in the joint, but causes surface fibrillation and deep fissures in cartilage. Moreover, rosemary essential oil reduces the number of migrated cells and the volume of inflammatory exudates after intrapleural injection of carrageenan in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p id="Par51">One of this study&#x02019;s future aims was to evaluate the nanoemulsion&#x02019;s efficacy in patients with osteoarthritis. We loaded the nanoemulsion in a gel formulation to easily use and control the drug&#x02019;s applied amount. To investigate gel formulation&#x02019;s effect on the nanoemulsion efficacy, we added the NS group to the study groups. Our results demonstrated the difference between NG and NS group was not significant in none of the tests. We can conclude that the formulation of the nanoemulsion in the gel doesn&#x02019;t change the effect of nanoemulsion on behavioral, biochemical, and histopathologic parameters.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par52">Our findings showed that the nanoemulsion containing peppermint and rosemary essential oil did not cause any irritation in the rabbit skin and any dermal toxicity and change in biochemical and hematological parameters in male and female rats. Moreover, the nanoemulsion reduced mechanical and thermal allodynia, thermal hyperalgesia, and ambulatory-evoked pain via increasing SOD and GPx activity, decreasing MDA levels, and improving the pathological features of rats&#x02019; knee joint with osteoarthritis. In conclusion, this novel nanoemulsion formulation can escalate the therapeutic effect of rosemary and peppermint essential oil as a topical treatment for osteoarthritis.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>OA</term><def><p id="Par5">Osteoarthritis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MIA</term><def><p id="Par6">Monosodium iodoacetate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TBA</term><def><p id="Par7">Thiobarbitoric acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SOD</term><def><p id="Par8">Superoxide dismutase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GPx</term><def><p id="Par9">Glutathione peroxidase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EDTA</term><def><p id="Par10">Ethylene-diaminetetrachloroacetic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ROS</term><def><p id="Par11">Reactive oxygen species</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PWT</term><def><p id="Par12">Paw withdrawal threshold</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PWF</term><def><p id="Par13">Paw withdrawals frequencies</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PWL</term><def><p id="Par14">Paw withdrawal latencies</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p>We would like to thank S.M.
