<p>The huge amount of natural antimicrobial compound applications and their direct inhibition of bacteria are detailed in terms of a range of applicationsâ€”for instance, in the avoidance of biofilms. The food industry may well benefit from this in-depth study, and it is likewise useful as a basis from which to obtain more potent compounds. We do expect that this group of manuscripts will be of great help to every scientist or professional interested in the biocontrol of bacteria, fungi or even other biological agents, using a natural alternative instead of the classical chemical compounds.</p>
