<p>Additionally, there are, as has been stated above, 12 research papers studying, firstly [
 <xref rid="B6-antibiotics-09-00217" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], the effect of protein extracts from 
 <italic>Loranthus europaeus</italic> berries against phytopathogenic fungi as well as foodborne bacteria. The already mentioned extracted experiments have shown an important activity against bacteria, though no effect against fungi was found. Bear in mind that you will also find the use of medicinal plants in this use against diarrhea [
 <xref rid="B7-antibiotics-09-00217" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This highlights an interesting aspect that needs further study as far as the metal content of these plants is concerned. Another research paper studies the properties of witch-hazel plants and Green tea extracts upon the pathogenesis inhibition of staphylococci [
 <xref rid="B8-antibiotics-09-00217" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In another extract worth mentioning, Hibiscus activity against multidrug-resistant bacteria is thoroughly described [
 <xref rid="B9-antibiotics-09-00217" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], along with the elucidation of the extract compounds by means of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (as well as other techniques). Two more papers covering the research on the use of natural compounds in animal production are also included within this Special Issue. They comprise broiler and laying hens, using Chicory (
 <italic>Chicorium intybus</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B10-antibiotics-09-00217" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] resulting in gut microbiota improving. Fermented defatted Alperujo is also focused upon, including its role in enhancing the absorption capacity of intestinal mucosa [
 <xref rid="B11-antibiotics-09-00217" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Furthermore, not only have we studied the effect of natural compounds on gut microbiota, but we have also covered those natural compounds produced by gut microbiota—the short-chain fatty acids (studied by Lamas et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-antibiotics-09-00217" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]; the latter study regarding the effect on the biofilm formation, gen expression, and motility of 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic>). Their effect against biofilm has also been observed using both honey [
 <xref rid="B13-antibiotics-09-00217" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and 
 <italic>Allium sativum</italic> fermented extract, and cannabinol oil extract [
 <xref rid="B14-antibiotics-09-00217" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The essential oil of 
 <italic>Zataria multiflora</italic> and hops extracts have also been tested in fresh sausages [
 <xref rid="B15-antibiotics-09-00217" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], so as to avoid using other conventional preservatives. They have shown, however, that using natural compounds does not always imply an antimicrobial effect, which introduces the need to study which types of application are most advisable for these compounds. Finally, two extra chapters focusing on natural antimicrobial compounds are included. These natural antimicrobial compounds can be used directly, as well as either in a modified or mixed way, so as to increase their activity. You will find, for example, mixtures of chitosan oligomers with ε-polylysine acting as antifungals against three 
 <italic>Botryosphareiaceae</italic> species [
 <xref rid="B16-antibiotics-09-00217" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Likewise, in the last paper [
 <xref rid="B17-antibiotics-09-00217" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], some berberine derivatives can be more potent than berberine itself in attenuating MexXY efflux-dependent aminoglycoside resistance in 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, demonstrating that natural compounds are not only useful when used in direct applications, but also to obtain derivative compounds with enhanced antimicrobial properties.
