<p>This book details the manuscripts in the Special Issue of Antibiotics: “Natural Compounds as antimicrobial agents”. Our in-depth study comprises 17 manuscripts, which focus on an important group of aspects related to biocontrol once this wide range of compounds has been used. Firstly, we start with two interesting reviews; one which deals with the use of traditional medicinal plants against clinical pathogens, documenting [
 <xref rid="B1-antibiotics-09-00217" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] a huge series of minimal inhibitory concentrations, using over 200 medicinal plants to fight pathogens off. The other is an analysis of the major applications of natural compounds for one of their main uses—food preservation so as to enhance food safety—in a review by prof. Quinto and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B2-antibiotics-09-00217" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Edible films as well as nanoparticles are also included. The food use of these compounds is perceived benevolently by consumers, so not only was the study of natural compounds as growth bacteria inhibitors examined in this present issue, but also the effect of these compounds on the virulent related factors of specific bacteria, i.e., T3SS (Type III Secretion System used by many Gram negative bacteria [
 <xref rid="B3-antibiotics-09-00217" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]). Further in the issue, you will also find two interesting reviews on the conventional meaning of “Natural Compounds” and conventional antibiotics, between which the borders are very thin. So thin, in fact, that many believe in the richness of extreme ecosystems for finding Actinobacteria-producing antibiotics [
 <xref rid="B4-antibiotics-09-00217" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and in the use of secondary metabolites from 
 <italic>Burkholderia</italic> as new sources in antibiotic development [
 <xref rid="B5-antibiotics-09-00217" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].
