<p>An indirect mechanism involved with antitrypanosomal activity is related with macrophage activation, particularly the nitric oxide (NO) induction. The NO-mediation directly kills

 <italic>T. cruzi</italic>-stimulated peritoneal macrophages treated with 
 <italic>A. rosaeodora</italic> essential oil or linalool. However, a significant decrease in nitrite levels was observed in cells non-stimulated with 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> and treated with 
 <italic>A. rosaeodora</italic> essential oil or linalool. Reactive oxygen species decrease was also observed in cancer cells lines treated with 
 <italic>A. rosaeodora</italic> essential oil, inhibiting apoptosis in these cells [
