 </sup> Researchers have used these methods for numerous studies of plants to analyze their physicochemical composition, particularly techniques such as gas chromatographyâ€“mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), which are highly sensitive. Even though the chemical composition of the essential oils extracted from
