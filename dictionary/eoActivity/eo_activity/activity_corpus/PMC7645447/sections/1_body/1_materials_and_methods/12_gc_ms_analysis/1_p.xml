<p>GC-MS analysis was performed on a 5975C Series GC/MSD instrument (Agilent Technology, Santa Clara, CA, USA) coupled with an HP-5ms fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm). The GC oven temperature was first raised from 60°C to 120°C at a rate of 10°C/minute, then increased at a rate of 3°C/minute to 175°C, 5°C/minute to 205°C, 0.8°C/minute to 210°C, and then 5°C/minute to 280°C. The temperature was then held at 280°C for 5 minutes, giving a total runtime of 55.583 minutes. The temperature of the split injector was set at 240°C and the split ratio was 1:10. The essential oil (1 µL) was injected into the GC. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 1.0 mL/minute. The mass spectrometer was operated in full-scan mode with an ionization energy of 70 eV and an interface temperature of 280°C. The MS source temperature and MS quadruple temperature were 230°C and 150°C, respectively. The scan range was from
