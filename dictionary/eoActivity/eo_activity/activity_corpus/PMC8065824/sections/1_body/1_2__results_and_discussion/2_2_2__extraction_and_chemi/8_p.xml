<p>Its 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectrum compared with the limonene one showed: (1) a methylene group with protons that had a chemical shift of 4.95 and 5.05 ppm instead of the methyl group of the limonene isopropenyl at the 1.70 ppm, (2) a methyl group with a typical acetate chemical shift at 2.07 ppm, (3) vinyl protons with a shifted signal, due to the presence of the acetate group, at 4.58 ppm instead of the typical one in limonene at 4.70 ppm. Similarly, the chemical shifts of 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectrum were assigned comparing with the limonene one [
