<p>Mutagenic activity was tested using the widespread and consolidated Ames test to verify the genotoxic safety of 
 <italic>H. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>aristatus</italic> essential oil. There are numerous strains of salmonella produced for mutagenic activity tests, each possessing a different mechanism and sensitivity. We have decided to test the sample on two different salmonella strains that can detect almost all potential mutagens; among the most stable strains and most commonly used in this type of test there are TA98, TA100. The TA98 strain is useful for detecting mutations that cause frameshifts, deletions or genomic insertions, it only changes the mutation site, which makes them complementary and most sensitive to some substances rather than others. TA100 mainly detects substances that cause base-pair replacement and have a different genome repair system. The results (
