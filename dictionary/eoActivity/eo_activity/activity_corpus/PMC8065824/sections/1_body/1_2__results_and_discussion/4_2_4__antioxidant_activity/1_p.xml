<p>Plants growing under unfavorable conditions generate high concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can cause oxidative stress. To prevent this, cells bring into play enzymatic and non-enzymatic elements that constitute the complex plant antioxidant system [
 <xref rid="B19-plants-10-00631" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The non-enzymatic part of this important system consists of molecules (e.g., phenols) that have various mechanisms of action, such as the inhibition of enzymes, the chelation of trace elements involved in the production of free radicals, or the absorption of reactive species.
