<p>The structure of limonen-10-ol methyl ether was deduced by comparing the fragmentation pattern to that of limonen-10-ol and observing the following differences: the molecular ion (
 <italic>m/z</italic> 166) lost a methyl radical (
 <italic>m/z</italic> 15) to give the cation ion (
 <italic>m/z</italic> 151) corresponding to limonen-10-ol one. Moreover, the shift of arithmetic index of a couple of compounds, thymol and thymol methyl ether (AI: 1289 and 1232, respectively) [
 <xref rid="B15-plants-10-00631" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], was comparable to that of limonen-10-ol and limonen-10-ol methyl ether (exp.AI: 1291 and 1235, respectively; AI: 1288 for limonen-10-ol from literature [
