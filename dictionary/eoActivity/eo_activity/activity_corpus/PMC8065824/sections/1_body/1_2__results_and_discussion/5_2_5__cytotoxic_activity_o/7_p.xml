 <italic>trans</italic>-thujone, 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene) and apoptosis-inducing (e.g., α-pinene, 
 <italic>cis</italic>- and 
 <italic>trans</italic>-thujone) activities. Moreover, this phytocomplex also contains methyl eugenol (15.8%) that is used as molecular scaffolding for the pharmacophore modeling of breast cancer invasion inhibitors [

 <xref rid="B35-plants-10-00631" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Therefore, the activity of this phytocomplex, although slight, could be motivated by the presence of the molecules listed above, but also by the synergies that can be created among them. Moreover, when ingested in liquid form, the T
 <sub>max</sub> (predicted times for phytochemicals to reach maximum plasma concentration) of EOs phytochemicals ranged from 0.8–1.2 h (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-10-00631">Figure S1</xref>) for all essential oils with predominant peaks and the prevalent phytochemicals are re-distributed without being swept away. Therefore, according to this simple model, we can assume the temporal conservation of the relative fraction composition after ingestion.
