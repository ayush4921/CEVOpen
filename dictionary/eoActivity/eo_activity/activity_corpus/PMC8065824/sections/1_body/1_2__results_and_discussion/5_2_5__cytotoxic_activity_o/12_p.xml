<p>To confirm these observations, the Pk-Sim PBPK model simulation for oral administration of one gram of the three ethanolic extracts, showed a substantial reduction of the quantified compounds in lung intracellular, interstitial and plasma concentration compared to the effective concentrations tested in the MTT assay, but the relative amounts of the three molecules are conserved without a substantial variation in the concentration ratios of the three components in the ethanolic extracts. PK-Sim simulation modeled on a healthy human subject 30th years old, with 73 Kg body weight and Body Mass Index of about 24 Kg/m
 <sup>2</sup> for an oral intake of comparable dose of caftaric, chlorogenic and rosmarinic acid in ethanolic extract, shows a substantial reduction of one order of magnitude in the lung interstitial concentration when compared to the administered doses. These results must be evaluated by considering that the in vitro concentration simulate interstitial concentrations, and that effective doses in MTT test are of one order of magnitude higher of the interstitial concentrations. Nevertheless, it should be considered that simulations are performed regardless drugs reciprocal interactions, as additives, synergistic, or inhibitory effects mediated by hepatic, renal, intestinal metabolism, or drug efflux protein. Kinetic parameters related to these effects are till now not available it will be the challenger for future implementations.
