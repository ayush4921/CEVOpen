<p>HaCat cell line incubated in presence of increasing concentrations of EOs (10, 20, 50, 100, 150, 200 Î¼g/mL) showed no significant differences compared to the negative control (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05), indicating lack of toxicity towards the considered cell line. This result, i.e., the lack of cytotoxicity of the EOs on the HaCat cell line, underlines their safety for possible health-care/cosmetic use regardless of the chemotype considered.
