<p>Among all ethanolic extracts, the one obtained from the sample CIV17-UAE did not show enough toxicity to calculate an IC
 <sub>50</sub> against the adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cell line. Unlike the latter extract, the other two showed a slightly higher activity exhibiting IC
 <sub>50</sub> values: NAV19-UAE showed an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 148.15 ± 5.97 μg/mL, while the extract CdG19-UAE showed an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 97.30 ± 3.08 μg/mL. These two samples also had cytotoxic effects on HaCat cell line, for concentration above 100 μg/mL, although without ever reaching 50% inhibition of viability (
