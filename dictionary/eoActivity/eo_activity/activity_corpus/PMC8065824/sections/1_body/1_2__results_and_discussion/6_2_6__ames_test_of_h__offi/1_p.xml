<p>We tested the essential oil obtained from the sample collected on 09/2017 in the Civitaretenga area because it consists of an unpublished chemotype characterized by limonen-10-yl-acetate (
 <italic>p</italic>-mentha-1,8-dien-10-yl acetate). EFSA, in the report “Scientific Opinion on Flavouring Group Evaluation 208Revision 2 (FGE.208Rev2): Consideration of genotoxicity data on alicyclic aldehydes with α,β-unsaturation in ring/side-chain and precursors from chemical 2.2 of FGE.19” [
 <xref rid="B38-plants-10-00631" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], concluded that 
 <italic>p</italic>-mentha-1,8-dien-7-al is genotoxic in vivo and, therefore there is a safety concern for its use as flavouring substance.
