<p>Cancer is one of the most important health problems of modernity. In particular, the World Health Organization (WHO) indicate the lung cancer as the most common type of cancer in both men and women with 2.09 million cases in 2019 [

 <xref rid="B26-plants-10-00631" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The path of prevention could be the key to improve this global situation and could be based on healthy habits that could ward off the risk of developing cancer, such as a healthy diet [

This approach aims at hitting several targets together, and in this context, plants naturally follow precisely the multi-target approach to life due to their resilient nature, and due to the fact that they need to defend themselves against a multitude of pests and predators without the ability to move. Their secondary metabolites, exhibiting various mechanisms of action, can play a key role in cancer prevention. Moreover, the idea that the pharmacological action of a phytocomplex is due to a single compound is now almost definitively abandoned. In its place, the belief that plant extracts can rely on additive and synergistic effects between their constituents for their pharmacological action has taken hold. They can perform their activity in concert, and this may involve the protection of an active substance from degradation by enzymes, modification of transport across barriers, circumvention of multi-drug resistance mechanisms or other signals to the hostâ€™s cell that results in a changed efficacy of the botanical drug when compared with isolated compounds [
