<p>On the basis of our results, there was instead a substantial difference in the composition of CIV17-EO when compared to the previous chemotypes. It showed a fingerprinting with the predominance of (-)-limonen-10-yl-acetate (67.9%) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00631-f003">Figure 3</xref>), which is not detectable in the previous literature data, followed by 1,8-cineole (15.5%), limonene (5.8%), limonen-10-ol (2.8%), limonen-10-ol methyl ether (1.9%), Î²-pinene (1.7%) and germacrene D (1.2%). It was therefore composed of a greater content of monoterpenes, deriving from limonene and a 2% of sesquiterpenes. To date, no authors has described this particular chemical composition for the essential oil of this subspecies.
