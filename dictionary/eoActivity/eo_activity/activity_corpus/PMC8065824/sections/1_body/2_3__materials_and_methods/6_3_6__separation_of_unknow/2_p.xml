<p>An aliquot of 250 μL of CIV17-EO was dissolved in 2 mL of mobile phase: hexane: ethyl acetate (98:2). Precoated silica-gel plates (silica gel 60 F
 <sub>254</sub>; thickness 0.25 mm; Merck) with the same above mobile phase were used to control the fraction separations: after development, the plate was sprayed with phosphomolybdic acid solution (20% phosphomolybdic acid in EtOH) [
