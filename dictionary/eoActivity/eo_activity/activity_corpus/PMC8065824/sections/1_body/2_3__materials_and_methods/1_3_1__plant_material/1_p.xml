 <italic>aristatus</italic> were collected from wild population of plants at early flowering stage in proximity of Gran Sasso Massif, at Civitaretenga (L’Aquila, Italy, GPS coordinate: 42.248534, 13.713459; 800 m asl), in September 2017, and at Navelli (L’Aquila, Italy, GPS coordinate: 42.245255, 13.733620; 720 m asl) and 2019 (sample CIV17 and NAV19, respectively) and on Majella Massif, at Campo di Giove (L’Aquila, Italy, GPS coordinates 42.005993, 14.030021, 1450 m asl) in October 2019 (sample CdG19). Plant material collection were carefully performed in order to not damage the wild population and obtaining a representative sample from no less than 10 plants. The samples authentication was performed by prof. Luigi Menghini according to Pignatti [
 <xref rid="B13-plants-10-00631" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and voucher specimens for each sample were deposited in the Herbarium of Giardino dei Semplici (Chieti, Italy). Plant material, represented by stems, leaves and flowers, was dried in ventilated oven at 40 °C. Reached a constant weight, the samples were transferred in vacuo plastic bag and stored in the dark at room temperature until used for ultrasound assisted extraction (UAE) or hydrodistillation to obtain the essential oil (EO).
