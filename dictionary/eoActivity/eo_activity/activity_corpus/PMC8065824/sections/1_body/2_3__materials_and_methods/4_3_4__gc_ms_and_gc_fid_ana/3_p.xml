<p>The experimental arithmetic index (AI) of each component was determined adding a C
 <sub>8</sub>-C
 <sub>32</sub> n-alkanes mixture (Sigma-Aldrich Italy, Milano, Italy) to the essential oil before injection in the GC-MS equipment and analyzing it under the same conditions reported above. The identification of compounds was performed by comparing their AI
 <sub>s</sub> and the MS fragmentation pattern with those of pure compounds, of mass spectra libraries and of literature data.
