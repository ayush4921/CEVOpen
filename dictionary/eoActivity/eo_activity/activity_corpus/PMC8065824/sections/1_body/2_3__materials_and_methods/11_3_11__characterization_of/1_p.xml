<p>Phytochemical pharmacokinetic profiles were explored as described in Selby-Pham et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-plants-10-00631" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] with some modifications. In brief, relative abundances (%A) of phytochemicals were sourced from gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The ‘functional fingerprints’ of phytochemical extracts, describing the relative accumulation of phytochemical abundances against predicted plasma T
 <sub>max</sub>, were produced as per Selby-Pham et al. using molecular mass and lipophilicity descriptor log P, sourced from the Molinspiration online property calculation toolkit [
 <xref rid="B45-plants-10-00631" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The phytochemicals clustering according to their pharmacokinetic prevalence can be used as a semi-quantitative tool oriented to extrapolate prevailing, synergistic, or additive effects observed in vitro to in vivo action.
