For this purpose, we used the PK-Sim software, Version 3.0 (Bayer Technology Services GmbH, Leverkusen, Germany). PK-Sim is based on a generic PBPK-model with 17 organs and tissues, including lung. Due to the lack of experimental data, pharmacokinetic properties are sourced from pkCSM online property calculation toolkit, and from ChemAxon online calculator toolkit for the pKa value [
