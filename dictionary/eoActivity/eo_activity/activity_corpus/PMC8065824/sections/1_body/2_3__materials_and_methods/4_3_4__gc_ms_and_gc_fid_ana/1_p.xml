<p>The GC-MS technique was used to qualitatively analyze the essential oils of 
 <italic>H. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>aristatus</italic>, the GC-FID to obtain quantitative data. The GC-MS analysis was performed with a Varian 3800 chromatograph (Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a Varian Factor Four VF-5ms column (5%-phenyl-95%-dimethylpolysiloxane, internal diameter: 0.25 mm, length: 30 m) interconnected with a Varian mass spectrometer SATURN MS-4000, with electronic impact ionization, ion trap analyzer and software provided with the NIST database for the identification of components. The experimental conditions used were the following: helium carrier gas (1 mL/min), split ratio of 1:50, ionization energy (EI) 70 eV, emission current of 10 μA, the scan rate of 1 scan/s, mass range 40–400 Da.
