<p>All samples of 
 <italic>H. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>aristatus</italic> dry aerial parts were milled through a 2 mm sieving ring of a Variable Speed Rotor Mill (Fritsch, Idar- Oberstein, Germany). Afterwards, 5 g of each milled plant material was added to 35 mL of ethanol and 15 mL of distilled water (drug/solvent ratio of 1:10) to obtain 70% ethanolic solution. The extractions were performed by an ultrasound device (Branson Bransonic CPXH Digital Bath 3800F, Emerson, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 30 min at room temperature. After centrifugation the 70% ethanolic extract was reduced in volume with a rotary evaporator (RV 10 digital, IKA
 <sup>®</sup>-Werke GmbH &amp; CO. KG, Staufen im Breisgau, Germany), then lyophilized to eliminate residual water. To produce the essential oil of 
 <italic>H. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>aristatus</italic>, 25 g of each milled plant material was weighed in a 1000 mL flask, then 300 mL of distilled water was added. The hydrodistillation was performed through a Clevenger type equipment. The distillation time was 3 h. At the end of the extraction process, the essential oils were stored in the dark at −18 °C.
