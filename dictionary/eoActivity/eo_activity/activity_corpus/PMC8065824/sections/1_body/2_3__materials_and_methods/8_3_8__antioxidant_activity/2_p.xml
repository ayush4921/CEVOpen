<p>The ABTS scavenging activity was evaluated using the method of Horszwald and Andlauer [
 <xref rid="B42-plants-10-00631" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. EO, alcoholic extracts, and pure molecules (rosmarinic acid, eugenol, and Trolox) were tested in a range of concentrations, respectively, 0.58–37 μg/mL, 2.08–133.33 μg/mL, and 0.21–13.33 μg/mL. Aqueous solution (7 mmol/L) of ABTS (10 mL) and 51.4 mmol/L aqueous solution of K
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> (0.5 mL) were mixed to obtain a radical cation solution that has been adjusted spectrophotometrically to 0.7 ± 0.05 at 734 nm. After 6 min of incubation in the dark at room temperature, microplates were analyzed with a microplate reader (BioRad 680 XR), and the absorbance was read at 734 nm in triplicate and against a blank. Antioxidant activity of the samples was expressed as IC
 <sub>50</sub>, the concentration providing 50% radical inhibition. All experiments were assessed in triplicate and values were reported as mean ± standard deviation.
