<p>HPLC analyses of ethanolic extracts of 
 <italic>H. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>aristatus</italic> were performed using a model PU 2089 modular HPLC system (JASCO, Tokyo, Japan,) coupled to a diode array apparatus (MD 2010 Plus) and a FinniganMAT LCQ (ThermoQuest Corp./FinniganMAT; San Jose, CA, USA) mass spectrometer module linked to an injection valve with a 20 μL sampler, according to previously described [
 <xref rid="B39-plants-10-00631" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. A Kinetex-C18 column (150×4.6 mm, 100 Å) was used. The method of quantification was validated and parameters are the following: for caftaric acid the calibration range was 2.5–50 µg/mL, the correlation coefficient (r
