<p>The present study points out the morphological, phytochemical and bioactivity aspects of 
 <italic>H. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>aristatus</italic> samples collected in different years in three representative locations in the Abruzzo Region (Central Italy) during the balsamic period. A pharmaceutical biology and pharmacognostic approach have been applied for morphological characterization of the samples to point out any possible significant morphological differences between the samples collected in different years. Similarly, the crude drugs have been subjected to standardized extraction procedures to obtain EOs and phenolic extracts, that have been chemically characterized and subjected to in vitro biological assays to point out differences among the harvested samples. The research would give a contribute to the recent publications regarding 
 <italic>H. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>aristatus</italic>, shedding light on a new EO chemotype, to improve the standardization of herbal products based on this extract, while also evaluating its safety and efficacy.
