<p>The chemical profile of plants is known to reflect the resilience of plants within the same species due to different climatic conditions, date of collections, allelopathy and many other environmental conditions and 
 <italic>H. officinalis</italic> with its subspecies clearly reflects this aspect. For what concerns 
 <italic>Hyssopus</italic> essential oils, that we may consider as the paradigmatic subject of the relationship between plant resilience and plant phytochemistry, there are strong compositional differences among the subspecies and between plants belonging to the same subspecies as clearly pointed out by literature and despite ISO 9841 directive [

 <italic>H. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>aristatus</italic> collected in different areas characterized by different environmental and climatic conditions and in different years, revealed important differences in essential oil composition [

 <xref rid="B12-plants-10-00631" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. For what concerns the phenolic fraction, the differences where less evident and seemed regard mainly the relative compounds proportions, in particular between chlorogenic acid, 4-O-caffeoylquinic acid, 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid and 4-O-feruloylquinic acid [

As a consequence of this chemodiversity, the bioactivity of essential oils and of the phenolic fraction may significantly vary, affecting the standardization of efficacy and safety of the crude drug and its phytocomplexes, as evidenced by related literature regarding in vitro and in vivo studies, mainly reflecting antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-viral, immunomodulatory, spasmolytic, platelet aggregation properties, the most relevant being [

 <xref rid="B10-plants-10-00631" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In light of these premises, 
 <italic>Hyssopus officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>aristatus</italic> (Godr.) Nyman represents a valuable research subject to clarify these variability aspects.
