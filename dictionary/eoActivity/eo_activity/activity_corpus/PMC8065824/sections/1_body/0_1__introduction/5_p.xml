<p>Cancer is one of the most important health problems of modernity, and natural compounds are considered more and more valuable candidates for the development of new intervention strategies to improve the low therapeutic index and the frequent occurrence of chemoresistance of the current anticancer therapies. The initial stages of carcinogenesis could be suppressed by antioxidants from plant sources through several modalities, for this reason the evaluation of antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>H. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>aristatus</italic> was accompanied by an assessment, albeit preliminary, of chemopreventive activity. These evaluations have been supported by in silico studies, used to obtain preliminary information on the absorption and distribution, after oral intake, of secondary metabolites present in the extracts in order to evaluate if the effects obtained in vitro can be hypothesized also in vivo. Therefore, this approach aims to take the first steps toward an assessment of in vitro biological activity that could exhibit an in vivo correspondence.
