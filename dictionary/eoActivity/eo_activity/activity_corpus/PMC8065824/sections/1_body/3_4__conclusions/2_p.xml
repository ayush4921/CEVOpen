<p>The Abruzzo region (Italy), since it reflects a typical Mediterranean plant biodiversity, has been chosen as the study area of 
 <italic>H. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>aristatus</italic> with the object to define its phytochemical and pharmaceutical biology profile. Samples from three different areas have been collected during two years and chemically characterized for their secondary metabolite profile. Therefore, the present work presents for the first time, alongside two already known EOs chemotypes, the evidence of a new chemotype never detected before, characterized by the prevalence of limonen-10-yl-acetate (67.9%). Being rich in this compound, which is part of a molecular category under observation by EFSA for its genotoxic potential, this EO was tested to first evaluate in vitro its safety with regard to this criticality. It did not show any mutagenic potential (Ames test), nor cytotoxicity (MTT test) towards the human cell line HaCat. Toxicity towards this cell line, however, was shown by the hydroalcoholic extract, but at a relatively high dose (&gt;100 Î¼g/mL).
