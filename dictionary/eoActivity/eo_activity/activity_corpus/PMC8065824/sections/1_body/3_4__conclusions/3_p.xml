<p>The three samples of 
 <italic>H. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>aristatus</italic> showed a different phytochemical composition reflecting different biological effects. The CdG2019-EO was the only one that showed a slight antioxidant activity, while all EtOH extracts, especially the CIV17-UAE one, evidenced interesting antioxidant activity, although with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of an order of magnitude lower than the positive control and the pure molecules identified. Phytocomplexes with antioxidant activity could exert anti-cancer effects through several mechanisms, including alterations in cell signaling, changes in cell cycle progression and modulation of enzymatic activities [

Moreover, considering their characteristics, natural compounds could be considered excellent candidates for the development of new intervention strategies to improve the low therapeutic index and the frequent occurrence of chemoresistance of the current anticancer therapies. The evaluation of the biological activity of 
 <italic>H. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>aristatus</italic> extracts against human cancer cell line started from these premises, and showed, although in a preliminary way, a statistically significant decrease in cell viability. Although far from the US National Cancer Institute reference values [
 <xref rid="B47-plants-10-00631" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], the extracts showed a degree of specificity towards A549 compared to the HaCat cell line, being therefore a starting point for the evaluation of an additional preventive tool for maintaining health status.
