<p>The variation in the heating temperatures influenced the compositions of saturated, unsaturated, and cyclic fatty acids. The observed effects of heating on fatty acid compositions were the same as those observed by Alil et al. [
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The compositions of saturated fatty acids responded differently to the changing temperatures. During heating of the baobab oil, chemical reactions occurred. One among the reactions was that oxygen which reacted with unsaturated fatty acids resulted in hydroperoxide formation. A study by Ludger [
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] observed that the geometrical isomerization of double bonds resulted in the formation of 
 <italic>trans</italic> fatty acids during heating of oils. For the saturated fatty acids, the compositions increased with an increase in temperatures in our study (
