<p>The highest values of free fatty acids were obtained from Kilimanjaro region (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). However, the values from all the three regions were lower than the values of 2.6 for baobab oil reported by Passera [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The low free fatty acids of baobab oil indicated that the oil may have a long shelf life and can be stored for a long time [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Baobab oil is extremely stable, and with proper storage conditions, it can have a highly variable shelf life of up to 5 years [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Furthermore, the fatty acid profile could significantly change due to the storage and climatic conditions; the profile could increase with period of storage, air, heat, traces of metal, peroxides, light, or double bonds present in the oil and thus leading to the deterioration of the quality [
