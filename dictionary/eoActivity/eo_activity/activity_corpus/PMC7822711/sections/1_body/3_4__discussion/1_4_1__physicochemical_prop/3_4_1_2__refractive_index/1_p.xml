<p>Our results for the baobab crude oil refractive index from the three regions were lower than the results reported by [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] which indicated baobab oil refractive index values of between 1.436 and 1.459 (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Our findings indicated slightly lower values than the values reported by [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] possibly because the oil solidified after exposure to air [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].
