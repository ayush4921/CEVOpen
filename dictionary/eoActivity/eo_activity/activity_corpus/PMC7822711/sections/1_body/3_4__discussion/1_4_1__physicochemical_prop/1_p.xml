<p>The physicochemical properties from the three different regions, except for refractive index and unsaponifiable matter, did not show any significant differences (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). This might be due to the fact that there were no variations in the environmental conditions in the regions where baobab fruits were collected (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The observed differences might be caused by the genotype of individual baobabs and the growth environments which affected the protein and subsequently changed the refractive index and unsaponifiable matter of the crude oil.
