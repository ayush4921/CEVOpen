<p>The study was conducted in the semiarid region in Tanzania located between latitude: 2°39′5.225
 <sup>″</sup>S, longitude: 34°8′29.364″E and latitude: 8°2′53.048
 <sup>″</sup>S, longitude: 35°3′18.731

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The altitude of the area ranges from 490 m to 1400 m. The semiarid areas in Tanzania receive rainfall of less than 800 mm annually and are characterized by a low amount of rainfall, high evapotranspiration rates, and erratic temporal and spatial distribution of rainfall [
