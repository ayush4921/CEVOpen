 <italic>(4) Saponification Value (SV)</italic>. About 2.0 g of crude oil sample was added into a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask, and then, 25 ml of the alcoholic potassium hydroxide solution was added. A blank sample was then prepared by placing 2.0 g of distilled water. The sample and the blank flasks were boiled in the boiling water bath for 1 hour under a reflux condenser. After boiling, the flask and the condenser were cooled with about 10 ml of hot ethyl alcohol neutral to phenolphthalein. The excessive potassium hydroxide was titrated with 0.5 N hydrochloric acid using about 1.0 ml phenolphthalein indicator. The saponified matter was obtained using equation (3).
