 <italic>(6) Peroxide Value (PV)</italic>. Five (5) grams of baobab crude oil sample was weighed into a 250 ml stoppered conical flask. Then, 30 ml of acetic acid-chloroform solvent mixture was added and swirled to dissolve. About 0.5 ml saturated potassium iodide solution was added and left to stand for 1 min in the dark with occasional shaking, and then, about 30 ml of water was added. The obtained mixture was slowly titrated against the liberated iodine of 0.1 N sodium thiosulphate solution and vigorously shaken until the yellow colour was almost gone. About 0.5 ml starch solution was added as an indicator and continued titration while shaking vigorously to release all I
 <sub>2</sub> from the CHCl
 <sub>3</sub> layer until the blue colour disappeared. If less than 0.5 ml of 0.1 N Na
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> is used, the process is repeated using 0.01 N Na
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>. Peroxide value expressed as milliequivalent of peroxide oxygen per kg sample (mEq/kg) was obtained by using equation (5).
