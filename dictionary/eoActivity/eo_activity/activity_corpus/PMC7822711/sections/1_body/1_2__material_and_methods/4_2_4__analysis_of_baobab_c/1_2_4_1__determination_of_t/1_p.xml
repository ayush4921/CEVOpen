<p>The physicochemical properties of baobab crude oil were determined following the methods of [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The baobab crude oil was obtained from 20 mature and intact baobab fruits (harvested from 3 trees per region) in which the physicochemical property parameters were analysed in three replicates per region. These parameters include free fatty acid (mEq/100 g oil), specific gravity (25°C/25°C), refractive index (27°C), unsaponification value, saponification matter, peroxide value, and iodine value. A total of twenty-one (21) samples were analysed for the physicochemical properties of baobab crude oil which included three replicated per region.
