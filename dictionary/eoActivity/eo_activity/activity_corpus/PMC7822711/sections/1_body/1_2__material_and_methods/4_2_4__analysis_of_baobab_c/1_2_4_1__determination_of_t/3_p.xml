 <italic>(2) Specific Gravity (SG)</italic>. Five (5) grams of baobab crude oil sample was warmed to 45°C to melt oil molecules. Then, the samples were left to cool until they reached a temperature of about 30°C. The dry pycnometer was filled with the prepared sample in such a manner that prevented entrapment of air bubbles after removing the cap of the sidearm. The stopper was inserted, immersed in a water bath at 30°C, and held for 30 minutes. The bottle was removed from the water bath, cleaned, dried thoroughly, and weighed ensuring that the temperature did not fall below 30°C. Specific gravity was calculated using equation (2).
