 <italic>(1) Preparation of Baobab Crude Oil Sample for FA Profiling Analysis</italic>. The fatty acid (FA) profiles of the crude oils were determined as fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) by gas chromatography through a method whereby alkaline hydrolysis is combined with boron trifluoride (BF
 <sub>3</sub>) catalyzed desterification [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The baobab crude oil was methylated by putting 2 mg of the sample in a flask and refluxing with 5 ml of 95 percent of methanol-HCL for 1 hour. The methyl esters were extracted with three portions of hexane (5 ml) and then washed with distilled water (5 ml). The hexane layer was dried in a vacuum rotary evaporator, and the residue was redissolved in 1 ml of hexane. Then, 1 
 <italic>μ</italic>l was injected into the GC under split mode of 60°C (Shimadzu GC-2010 equipped with an autosampler) with a capillary column, Supelco Carbowax size 30 m × 0.53 mm, injection temperature of 240°C, and detection temperature of 260°C under a flame ionization detector. Fatty acid methyl esters were identified by comparing the retention with standard times and expressed as percentages of the total methyl esters.
