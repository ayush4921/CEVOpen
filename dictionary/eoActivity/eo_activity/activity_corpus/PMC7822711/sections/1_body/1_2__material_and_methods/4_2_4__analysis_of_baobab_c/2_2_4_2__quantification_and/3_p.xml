 <italic>(2) Preparation of the Methyl Esters for Cyclopropenoid</italic>. Methyl esters were prepared from oils by refluxing approximately 100 mg of the crude oils with 5 ml of a solution of 1 percent sodium methoxide (0.5 N) in methanol. After 20 minutes, the solution was cooled, flooded with 15 ml of distilled water, and the methyl esters extracted twice with 10 ml of petroleum ether (BP 30-60°C). The esters were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and evaporated in a gentle stream of nitrogen just to dryness.
