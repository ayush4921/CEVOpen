<p>Descriptive statistics were performed to quantify the amount of fatty acids (saturated and unsaturated fatty acids) and cyclic fatty acids (CPFAs) in baobab seed crude oil using the MS Excel spreadsheet. The samples were analysed in triplicate, and the data were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to test for significant differences between the composition of fatty acids and CPFAs in three different regions and treatments. ANOVA with Tukey's least significant difference (LSD) test was used in SPSS version 17.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) to evaluate the differences between and within fatty acids and CPFAs. The differences were considered statistically significant at
