 <italic>(1) Free Fatty Acids (FFA)</italic>. Five (5) grams of homogenized and sieved crude oil sample was weighed in a 250 ml conical flask. About 50-100 ml of freshly neutralized hot ethyl alcohol was added to the oil sample followed by the addition of about 1 ml of phenolphthalein indicator. The mixture was boiled for about five minutes and titrated while hot, against standard 0.1 N potassium hydroxide solution while shaking vigorously until the mixture formed a pink colour, which persists for about 15 minutes.
