 <italic>(7) Iodine Value (IV)</italic>. About 5 g of baobab crude oil sample was weighed into a 250 ml conical flask with a glass stopper, and thereafter, 25 ml of carbon tetrachloride was added to it. The contents were thoroughly mixed followed by addition of 25 ml of Wij's solution, and a glass stopper was placed on it. The mixture was left to stand for 30 minutes with occasional stirring. Simultaneously, a blank was prepared by adding of 5 g of distilled water instead of a sample. After standing for 30 minutes, 15 ml of saturated potassium iodide solution was added, and then, 100 ml of recently boiled and cooled water was added, rinsing in the stopper. The liberated iodine was titrated with 0.1 N sodium thiosulphate solution using starch as an indicator until the formed blue colour disappeared after thorough shaking with the stopper on. Iodine value was calculated by using equation (6).
