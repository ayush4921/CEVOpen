 <italic>(5) Unsaponified Matter</italic>. Five (5) grams of well-mixed baobab crude oil sample was weighed into a 250 ml conical flask; then, 50 ml of alcoholic potassium hydroxide solution was added, and the content was gently boiled under a reflux air condenser for one hour. After boiling, the condenser was washed with 10 ml of ethyl alcohol; the mixture was cooled and transferred to the separating funnel. About 50 ml of petroleum ether was added to the mixture in the separating funnel, shaken vigorously, and layers were allowed to separate. The lower soap layer was transferred into another separating funnel. The combined ether extract was washed three times with 25 ml portions of aqueous alcohol and then washed with 25 ml portions of distilled water to ensure that the ether extract is free of alkali (washing is no longer alkaline to phenolphthalein). The ether solution was transferred into a 250 ml beaker, evaporated to about 5 ml, and transferred quantitatively using several portions of ether into a 50 ml Erlenmeyer flask previously dried and weighed. The residues were dissolved in 50 ml of warm ethanol which was neutralized to a phenolphthalein endpoint and titrated with 0.02 N NaOH. The unsaponified matter was calculated using equation (4).
