<p>The baobab crude oil from the three regions was subjected to three different high temperatures (150°C, 200°C, and 250°C) and boiling duration of 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes in the microwave oven (800 watts). The unheated crude oil sample was used as control (corresponding to 0 min). In these 3 × 4 factorial experiments, temperature and time were the treatments. After the heating experiment, the quantification of fatty acid and CPFA composition was carried out as shown in
