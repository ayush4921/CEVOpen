<p>The results showed that the average peroxide values of the baobab crude oil samples were 3.8 ± 0.61, 3.69 ± 0.10, and 3.83 ± 0.35 mEq/kg for Iringa, Dodoma, and Kilimanjaro regions, respectively. The highest values for baobab crude oil samples were obtained from Kilimanjaro, and the lowest values were obtained from Dodoma region. In this study, the average iodine values for baobab oil were 87.16 ± 5.3, 87.69 ± 0.61, and 90.70 ± 1.71 g/100 g for Iringa, Dodoma, and Kilimanjaro, respectively (
