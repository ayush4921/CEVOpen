<p>The specific gravity value is a good measure of purity of oils. Fatty acids in the oil affect the specific gravity of oil; therefore, the higher the value in the chain length of fatty acid present in oil, the higher the rise in the specific gravity of oils. The average specific gravity of baobab crude oil samples at 25°C was 0.928 ± 0.001 in all the three sampled regions (
