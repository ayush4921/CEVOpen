<p>The results showed that the CPFA compositions decreased with an increase in temperature (&gt;150°C). The decomposition of all cyclic acids was relatively higher at the temperature of 200°C in 20 minutes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The decomposition decreased by about 2-8 percent and 5-15 percent of the original concentration in sterculic and dehydrosterculic fatty acids, respectively. There is a significant difference (
