<p>The quality of crude baobab seed oil samples was determined by evaluating the physicochemical properties. The parameters analysed were free fatty acids (FFA), specific gravity, saponification value, unsaponifiable matter, peroxide value, and iodine value. Except for refractive index and unsaponifiable matter, no significant differences (
