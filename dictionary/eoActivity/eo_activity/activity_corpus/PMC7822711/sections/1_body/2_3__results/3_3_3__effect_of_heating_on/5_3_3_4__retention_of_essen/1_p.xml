<p>At 250Â°C, the results showed that CPFA compositions decreased with time. Regarding essential fatty acids, oleic and palmitic acid increased, while linolenic decreased with heating time. Likewise, dehydrosterculic and sterculic acids decreased with heating time. After 15 minutes, the results showed that all CPFAs had reached the composition of below 0.4 percent, which was recommended by TFDA, while the essential fatty acids were retained (
