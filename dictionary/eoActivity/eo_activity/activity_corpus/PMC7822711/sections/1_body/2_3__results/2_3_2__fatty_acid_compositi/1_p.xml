<p>In this study, twelve fatty acids were identified and quantified from baobab seed oil collected from three different regions in the semiarid areas of Tanzania (
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). In our study, we found that the total composition of fatty acid in the baobab crude oil was 98.09â€‰wt percent. The composition percentages of fatty acid in baobab crude oil were 68.59, 28.39, and 3.02 percent for unsaturated, saturated, and cyclic fatty acids, respectively. There were no significant differences (
