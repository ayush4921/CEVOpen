<p>The unsaturated fatty acids identified were oleic, vaccenic, linoleic, linolenic, and arachidonic. Baobab seed oil was found to contain both mono (oleic and vaccenic) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (linoleic, linolenic, and arachidonic). Furthermore, there were no significant differences (

 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The range of the amount of unsaturated fatty acid found in baobab oil was vaccenic 3.64-5.48%, oleic 24.4-29.52%, linoleic 21.20-24.86%, linolenic 12.14-26.69%, and arachidonic 0.54-1.30%. Furthermore, the study identified two cyclic fatty acids, namely, sterculic (0.97-1.45%) and dehydrosterculic (0.80-1.29%). There were significant differences (
