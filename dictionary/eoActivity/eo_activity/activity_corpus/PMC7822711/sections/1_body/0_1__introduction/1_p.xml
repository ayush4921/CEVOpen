<p>The baobab (
 <italic>Adansonia digitata</italic> L.) is a tree species native to the semiarid areas of Africa, Australia, and Madagascar [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The tree is among the eight global species of baobab in the genus 
 <italic>Adansonia</italic> from the family Malvaceae and subfamily Bombacaceae [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. 
 <italic>A. digitata</italic> is one of the most important tree species of nontimber forest products (NTFPs) that significantly contribute to the food and nutrition security of rural communities [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. For example, pulp, leaves, and seeds of the tree are rich in food nutrients such as minerals, fatty acid, and vitamins [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The baobab leaves are rich in calcium ranging from 307 to 2640 mg/100 g dry weight (dw) and proteins with a chemical score of 0.81 [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The baobab pulp is rich in vitamin C; the consumption of 40 g of baobab pulp contains more than 80 percent of the Recommended Daily Intake (RDI) of vitamin C [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], which is suitable for pregnant women. The baobab seeds and its kernels contain high lipid content ranging from11.6 to 33.3 g/100 g dw and 18.9 to 34.7 g/100 g dw, respectively [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The pulp and leaves exhibit antioxidant properties with higher activity in the pulp than in the leaves [
