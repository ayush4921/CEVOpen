<p>The Malvaceae family has seed oil that contains essential fatty acids including palmitic, oleic, linolenic, and cyclic fatty acids (cyclopropene fatty acids) [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It has been reported that cyclopropene fatty acids are often accompanied by a smaller proportion of cyclopropanic fatty acids such as dihydrosterculic and dihydromalvalic acids, which are the dihydro analogues of cyclopropene fatty acids [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Studies revealed that CPFAs occur in lipids of the plant species including the seeds of baobab of the order Malvaceae, Tiliaceae, Bombacaceae, and Sterculiaceae families [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The CPFAs, which have been reported as frequent and dominant in baobab seed oil include sterculic acid [8-(2-octyl-1-cyclopropenyl) octanoic acid] and malvalic acid [7-(2-octyl-1-cyclopropenyl) heptanoic acid] [
