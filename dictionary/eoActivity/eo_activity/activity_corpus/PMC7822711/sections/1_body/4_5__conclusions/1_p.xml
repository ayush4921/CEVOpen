<p>Our study identified 12 fatty acids, namely, myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic, stearic, arachidic, oleic, vaccenic, linoleic, linolenic, arachidonic, sterculic, and dehydrosterculic from the baobab oil. The presence of oleic and linoleic fatty acidy contributed to the medicinal value of the baobab oil. The physicochemical property values indicated that baobab oil has low unsaturation fatty acids making it edible as it is in liquid form at room temperature. The fatty acid profile of baobab seed oil is similar across all regions in the semiarid zone of Tanzania. Oleic, linoleic, and palmitic acids were found to be the major FAs, while stearic and linolenic acids were minor FAs. The possible existence of similar environmental conditions in the semiarid regions of Tanzania would not affect the FA pattern but might influence the quantities of some FAs of the seed oil. There is a need of assessing the pattern of FAs which are not included in this study in order to determine whether other FAs could be potential markers for baobab seed oil. The heating of baobab oil causes an increase of saturated fatty acids at temperatures of 150°C and 200°C. Sterculic and dehydrosterculic fatty acids were the CPFAs detected during this study. Further studies should be carried out to investigate the presence of malvalic acid in the baobab oil. It has been observed that a major breakdown of CPFA was at 200°C. The present results indicated that heating the baobab oil has an effect on the fatty acid composition as well as the amount of CPFAs. The temperature ranging from 200°C to 250°C of could be the optimal in the refining process of the baobab crude oil especially on the reduction of CPFA to the level that is recommended for human consumption.</p>
