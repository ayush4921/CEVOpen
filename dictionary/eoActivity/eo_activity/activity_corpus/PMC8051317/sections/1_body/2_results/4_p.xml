<p>Wolfberry can provide almost twice vitamin A that a person needs in a day (Liu et al., 2018
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>). It has almost a third of the daily recommended vitamin C. Moreover, wolfberry is rich in some important and essential minerals including iron and potassium. Endes et al. (2015)
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref> reported that this crop includes essential oils, vitamins (A, A, and C), amino acids, mineral elements (K, P, Ca, Mg, Fe, and Na), and betaine. Wolfberry contains high levels of fibre and protein, which means that itcan help to provide a feeling of fullness without the need to take an inordinate amount of calories. The nutritional and functional properties of wolfberryare provided by a rich variety of components, including amino acids, polyphenols, carotenoids, polysaccharides, organic acids and their derivatives (Bertoldi et al., 2019
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>; Zhao et al., 2019
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>). Mocan et al. (2018)
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref> reported that wolfberry isa rich source of bioactive compounds with functional properties that need further risk/benefit evaluation when used in foods or health promoting formulations. There are many varieties of wolfberry grown in differentparts of the world. As the popularity of the berry continues to grow, more and more varieties will likely appear as the vine is cultivated for commercial purposes. But it is said that the most powerful and nutrient rich wolfberryin China still comes from the vines of Himalayan valleys. Goji is a good source of fibre, protein, carotenoids, and polysaccharides (Shahrajabian et al., 2018
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>). It also has a lot of biological activities, including antidiabetes, antiproliferative activity, preserving retinal function, and antioxidant activity (Song and Xu, 2013
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>; Magiera and Zareba, 2015
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>; Zhang et al., 2016
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>). Donno et al. (2015)
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref> mentioned that wolfberry is as a rich source of antioxidant compounds with health promoting properties comparable with other common fruit species. Recent studies have shown that antioxidant activities of some natural products are correlated with defence against oxidative stress and different human diseases including cancer, arteriosclerosis and aging process (Willcox et al., 2004
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>). Compounds of nutritional value in gojiare diverse and theyincludepolysaccharides, carotenoids, polyphenols, essential oils, betaine, vitamins, amino acids and oligo elements (Forino et al., 2016
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>). Wolfberry is rich in sugars and lipids (Blasi et al., 2017
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>). Wojdylo et al. (2018)
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref> indicated that apart from being natural, nontoxic colorants in drinks and cosmetics, gojicarotenoids show biological activity (e.g. they act as antioxidants or precursors of vitamin A). Xie et al. (2016)
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref> reported that 
 <italic>LyciumBarbarum</italic> can be utilized as a pharmaceutical for treatment and as an ingredient in Chinese cooking. Cheng et al. (2015)
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref> reported that wolfberry has long been used to promote fertility and as a potent anti-aging and antioxidant agent. Wolfberry also has fatty acids (hexadecanoic acid, linoleic acid and myristic acid) (Blasi et al., 2017
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>), and amino acids (proline, betaine and taurine) (Potterat, 2010
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>). Yan et al. (2014)
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref> in their experiment, indicated that the contents of nutritional components in the different tissues were significantly different. The pollen and the fruit contained highly unsaturated fatty acids. All the tissues were good sources of mineral elements, polysaccharides and phenolic compounds. Furthermore, they have found that Ningxia wolfberry pollen, leaf and flower can be a potential source of nutrients for humans and animals.It has also effectiveness in aging, increased metabolism, immune system, liver function and glycemic control (Silva et al., 2017
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>). However, their benefits are attributed to the bioactive component polysaccharide-protein complex 4 (LBP4), which is composed of six monosaccharides (galactose, glucose, rhamnose, arabinose, and mannoseandxylose) (Lu and Zhao, 2010
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>; Carnes et al., 2013
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>). Soaresde Sousa et al. (2016)
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref> noted that gojiis rich in vitamins and minerals that protect the central nervous system, reduces the risk of glaucoma and has antitumor activity, prevents chronic diseases such as hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, hepatitis, and helps in reducing fatigue and greater resistance in exercise, being a strong ally in the prevention of aging. It has been found that the flavonoids from wolfberryprotect the blood cells and mitochondria against oxidative damages (Luo et al., 2004
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>). Jin et al. (2013)
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref> demonstrated that 
 <italic>L. barbarum </italic>polysaccharides have various important biological activities, such as antioxidant, immunomodulation, antitumor, neuroprotection, radioprotection, anti-diabetes, hepatoprotection, anti-osteoporosis and anti-fatigue. Masci et al. (2018)
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref> also concluded that the purified components of wolfberrymay be potentially useful as adjuvants in the treatment of diabetes and its correlated illnesses. A human supplementation trial showed that daily intake of wolfberryincreased plasma levels of zeaxanthin (Hempel et al., 2017
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>). Some health benefits of wolfberry are boosted immune system and flu protection, potential weight loss aid, antioxidants for eyes and skin, maintain blood sugar, increased testosterone, restored body homeostasis and strengthened body energy (Protti et al., 2017
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>). Some researchers reported that the carotenoid profile of wolfberryis the subject of different reports, where zeaxanthin-dipalmitatewas confirmedas the major carotenoid of wolfberry (Hempel et al., 2017
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>; Fratianni et al., 2018
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>). Fratianni et al. (2018)
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref> mentioned that the dried samples of wolfberrycould be used as a dietary source of carotenoid and be worthy of development and utilization. Dried fruits can be eaten raw and used in confectionary or in bakery products, added to trail mix, cereals, muffins, energy bars or soups. Wolfberrycontains not only high amounts of antioxidants, carotenoids, vitamin A and zeaxanthin, but also it is rich in vitamins B and C and polysaccharides (Skenderidis et al., 2018
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>; Senica et al., 2018
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>). In addition, flavonoids such as rutin, gentistic acid and quercetin are the main active compounds present in the leaves of 
 <italic>Lycium barbarum</italic> (Dermesonlouoglou et al., 2018
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>). Goji extracts were proven to possess biological activities, e.g. anti-ageing effects, increased metabolism, antioxidant properties, anti-diabetes and glucose control, immunomodulation, anti-glaucoma, neuroprotection, anti-fatigue/endurance, cytoprotection and antitumour activity (Potterat, 2010
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>). Numerous studies indicated the powerful antioxidant potentialities achieved from 
 <italic>L. barbarum </italic>molecules, with various health protective effects (Abdennacer et al., 2015
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>). It waswell documented that several traditional herb and plant extracts have antioxidant properties and are potential candidates for the prevention and treatment of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced diseases (reactive oxygen species) (Leontopoulos et al., 2017
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>). Driedgojifruits (
 <italic>L. Chinese</italic>) havethe highest content of total polyphenols and vitamin C based on the cellular juice concentration due to fruits dehydration. The DPPH (2, 2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate) method was affected by the content of vitamin C(Rocchetti et al., 2018
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>). Macronutrients include carbohydrates, protein, fat, and dietary fibre. It was shown that 68% of the mass of dried wolfberryexists as carbohydrate, 12% as protein, and 10% each as fibre and fat each, giving a total caloric value of 370 (kilo) calories in a 100 gram serving, of which 272 come from carbohydrates and 90 from fat. Yu et al. (2006)
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref> mentioned that the pharmacological activities associated with 
 <italic>L. barbarum</italic> include hypoglycemia, immunomodulation, anti-hypertension, lipotropic, protecting hepatic function, anti-aging, anti-fatigue, antioxidant, etc. Some researches indicated that components of berry fruits especially wolfberry may inhibit replication oftheinfluenzavirus both directly and indirectly, e.g. by blocking surface flycoproteins of influenza virus and stimulating the immune system of the organism; Inconsequence to its properties berry fruits, wolfberry included, are raw materials of potential use in the prevention and treatment of influenza (Gramza-Michalowska et al., 2017
