<p>Goji (
 <italic>L. Barbarum</italic> L.) which is also called wolfberry is very hard, spiny, shrubby vines in the tomato-nightshade family Solanaceae (Amagase and Farnsworth, 2011
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>). Wolf berry has different vernacular names; the most common name, wolfberry, comes from the character“gou”as it is related to the one that means wolf. The name goji is an extrapolation of a number of native words, and it was originally coined in 1973 by researchers at the Tanaduk Botanical Research Institute (TBRI) (Amagaseand Farnsworth, 2011
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>). Goji plants are native to China, where they grow from the subtropics in the south to the cold, dry climate on Inner Mongolia. Commercial fruit production is concentrated near Inner Mongolia. The fruits are red like a tomato, with a green calyx near the stem. Seeds are small and edible, similar to tomato seeds. Flowers havea purple colour which fades to yellow (Amagase and Farnsworth, 2011
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>). Geographical origin is one of the most important quality parameters for many foods, as differences in climate, soil and cultivation methods cause differences in the chemical composition of the plants. Ningxia is recognized as the daodi region of goji, increasing market demands pushed the cultivation into new regions in China and gojifields now stretch over different geographical and climatic environments between 82
 <sup>o</sup>E and 115
 <sup>o</sup>E, 30
 <sup>o</sup>N and 45
 <sup>o</sup>N. These include temperate monsoon climate (Hebei), temperate continental semi-arid climate (Ningxia, Gansu and Inner Mongolia), plateau continental climate (Qinghai), and continental arid climate (Xinjiang) (Li et al., 2017
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>). These different environmental conditions influence both the appearance and the metabolite profile ofgoji (e.g. amount of polysaccharides, flavonoids, betaine, and carotenoids) (Shen et al., 2016
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>). Gojiprefers a moderately moist, well-drained soil, but it isalso fairly drought tolerant. The berries are produced and ripen the best in full sun. Wolfberry shrubs have long, arching branches that hold up better with some structural support. The famers can also train gojisonto a trellis, fence or any other solid structure. Due to their vigorous growth habit,goji can be pruned anytime to control its height and shape. Yao et al. (2018)
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref> reported that it does not justify superiority of a specific production area over other areas. Instead, it will be essential to distinguishgoji from different regions based on the specific morphological and chemical traits with the aim to understand what its intended uses are. From an agronomical point of view, each region produces specific cultivars that may differ in chemical composition and biological properties (Wojdylo et al., 2018
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>). Their undocumented legend, however, is considerably older, as wolf berries are often linked in Chinese lore to ShenNung (Shennong), China
 <sup>’</sup>s legendary First Emperor, mythical father of agriculture, and herbalist who lived circa 2800 BC. The book was named “Shennong Ben Cao Jing” and supposed to contain all of the emperor
 <sup>’</sup>s knowledge on the subject of agriculture. There is another important Chinese book written by Li Shi-Zhen in the 16
 <sup>th</sup> century that also included important information on the subject of the wolfberry. From a TCM point of view, the nature of wolfberry is calm, and its flavour is sweet. According to TCM theory and practice, wolf berry can act on both the liver channel and the kidney channel, and the major health benefits of wolfberry are its ability to nourish and tonify the liver and kidney (Cieslik and Gebusia, 2012
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>). It should be noted that wolfberry is used not only as a drug in TCM prescriptions to treat diseases but also as a popular food consumed by Chinese people in their daily life for promotion of general health. According to the regulations of the China State Food and Drug Administration, wolfberry is one of the 87 TCM ingredients that can be used as both normal and functional food (Fiorito et al., 2019
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>; Shahrajabian et al., 2019
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>). One theory as to the origin of the wolfberry name stems from speculation that Chinese farmers saw wolves sheltering among the dense wolfberry vines. Most of theworld
 <sup>’</sup>swolfberry production centres are around areas in North western China, where there are 200,000 acres of farmland dedicated to wolfberry cultivation. Wolfberry plantations can also be found in Inner Mongolia and Shaanxi.Wu et al. (2018)
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref> also reported that northwest regions of China are the main producing area of 
 <italic>L. barbarum</italic>, including Xinjiang, Tibet, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Qinghai and Gansu. Wolfberries provide 8 essential amino acids that the body cannot synthesize. One of the most important reasons for the popularity of wolfberryis the fact that they contain a high concentration of an antioxidant called Zeaxanthin. According to various studies, a diet that contains wolfberry can increase a person
 <sup>’</sup>szeaxanthinlevels by as much as 26. Wolfberry is frequently added to soups, hot pots, and herbal teas, and is also popularly soaked in wines alone or together with other TCM ingredients to make functional wines (Zhang et al., 2015
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>). On the basis of TCM view, wolfberry is mainly used in treating yin deficiency in the liver and kidney. The dried fruit is commonly used in TCM preparations at a dose of 6-15 g, taken twice or thrice daily (Liu and Tseng, 2005
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>). Wolfberry can also be a part of a mix of Chinese herbs that is ground to a fine powder and used in honey pills. Nutricosmetics are used for the promotion of skin and hair health. Only angelica and pearl powder are more frequently found in nutricosmetic products in China (Bucheli et al., 2011
