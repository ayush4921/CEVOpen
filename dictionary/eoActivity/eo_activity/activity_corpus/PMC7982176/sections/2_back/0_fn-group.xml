  <p>The above proposal was reviewed on June 29, 2018. The proposal did not appear to involve “human subjects" as defined in 45 CFR 46. 102(f); and therefore, is not subject to oversight by the Institutional Review Board. This research activity determination of “research that does not involve human subjects” required that the investigator and study personnel only receive information that is totally deidentified, meaning the data did not contain any direct or indirect HIPAA identifier.</p>
