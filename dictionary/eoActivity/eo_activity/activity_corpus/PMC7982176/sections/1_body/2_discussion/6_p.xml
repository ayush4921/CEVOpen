<p>In cells from patients with CHF, CB

 </sup> Cell culture studies from patients with MIs, and large ischemic insults, showed no change in CB
 <sub>1</sub> and an upregulation of CB
 <sub>2</sub>.

 </sup> In addition, CB
 <sub>1</sub> antagonism promotes cardiac remodeling following MI.

 </sup> Thus, the downregulation of CB
 <sub>1</sub> observed in CHF might be maladaptive.
