<p>Several hypotheses outline the importance of upregulated CB
 <sub>2</sub> in cardiomyocytes following cardiovascular insult. Most notably, CB
 <sub>1</sub> and CB
 <sub>2</sub> are hypothesized to play a dual role in regulating positive/negative inotrope through GPCRs. Specifically, the inhibitory Gi and Go proteins, and/or Gq proteins that resemble myocardial 5-HT
 <sub>2A</sub>.

 </sup> CB
 <sub>2</sub> agonists are even known to be cardioprotective during times of acute ischemia, limiting myocardial damage during prolonged oxygen deprivation. An increase in CB
 <sub>2</sub> might be responsible for the compensatory and beneficial mechanisms observed in CHF.
