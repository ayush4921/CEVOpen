<p>Starkly contrasting cannabis-induced AMI, emerging data explore a multifactorial role of MC in the treatment of UA and CAD via modulation of the ECS, CB
 <sub>1</sub>, and CB
 <sub>2</sub>. Altered expression of the CB
 <sub>1</sub> and CB
 <sub>2</sub> receptors has been demonstrated in the myocardium of mice, as well as in human cell culture, for models of cardiovascular disease, CHF, and ischemic insult.
