 </sup> CBD, however, has little affinity for CB
 <sub>1</sub> or CB
 <sub>2</sub>. Instead, acting as a CB
 <sub>1</sub> inverse agonist indirectly via GPCRs. CBD also acts on noncannabinoid targets, that is, as a GPR-55 antagonist and 5-HT
 <sub>1A</sub> agonist. CB
 <sub>1</sub> blockade is a proposed druggable target in cardiomyopathies because inhibition reverses negative inotropy.
