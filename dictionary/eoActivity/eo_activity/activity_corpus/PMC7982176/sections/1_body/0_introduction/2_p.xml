<p>Upon consumption, cannabis rapidly stimulates the endocannabinoid system (ECS) with an onset 20 minutes to 2â€Šhours after ingestion or from 2 to 20 minutes after inhalation. The ECS consists of the neurotransmitters anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol, the CB
 <sub>1</sub> and CB
 <sub>2</sub> receptor system, as well as other noncannabinoid targets (g-protein coupled receptor [GPCRs]).

 </sup> The CB
 <sub>1</sub> receptor is most concentrated in the hippocampus, periaqueductal grey, spinal trigeminal nucleus, amygdala, cerebellum, basal ganglia,

 </sup> The CB
 <sub>2</sub> receptor system is largely concentrated outside of the central nervous system and primarily exhibits its effects on the immune system, systemic inflammatory state, the gut, cardiomyocytes, and vascular smooth muscle.
