<p>The physiological response to ingestion or inhalation of cannabis in an acute setting is well defined and consists of hypertension and reflex tachycardia.

 </sup> Whereas, in long-term users, or under chronic administration, cannabis produces bradycardia and hypotension.

 </sup> It is largely believed that these physiological effects are controlled by a fluctuating excitation/inhibition of CB
 <sub>1</sub> receptors on postsynaptic sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers, during acute and chronic administration, respectively.

 </sup> Cannabis has also been shown to have significant properties as a vasodilator, acting through noncannabinoid targets, such as the newly discovered GPCRs class known as the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1.

 </sup> These effects are seen within minutes to hours of administration and mediated by the ECS; playing an essential role in cardio metabolic risk, atherosclerosis, and limiting damage to cardiomyocytes during ischemic events.
