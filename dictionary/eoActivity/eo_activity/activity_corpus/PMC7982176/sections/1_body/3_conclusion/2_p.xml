<p>This case report supports MC as an adjunctive treatment for UA and CAD. We hypothesize that our patient's improved metabolic exercise tests, UA, CP, reduced ischemic changes during stress tests, and overall increase in cardiovascular health/functional capacity, to be the result of a multifactorial mechanism. The mechanism of the ECS, its role in cardiovascular function, CP, and other systemic pathological states, have yet to be fully elucidated. It is, however, possibly the result of mixed CB
 <sub>1</sub> and CB
 <sub>2</sub> agonists/antagonists acting systemically on cardiomyocytes, vascular smooth muscle, and inflammatory cytokines/proinflammatory cells. Thus, increased appreciation of the involvement of the ECS in cardiac function and CP could result in greater use of agents targeting this system for CAD and related conditions.
