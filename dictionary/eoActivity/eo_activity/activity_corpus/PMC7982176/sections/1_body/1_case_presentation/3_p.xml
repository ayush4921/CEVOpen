<p>Stents were placed for diffuse atherosclerotic changes (see supplemental Table 1, summary of cardiac history [2009â€“2010]), and inoperable triple-vessel CAD which was identified via percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. The RMCA was small, nondominant, with subtotal occlusion. There was 10% luminal compromise of the LMCA. Heavy calcification was noted within all of the diagonals of the LAD, whereas the LAD itself was diffusely diseased with areas of ectatic dilation and moderate stenosis, 60% to 70%. There was an aneurysmal dilation in the proximal LAD and a bare-metal stent was deployed distal to the dilation, in the mid-LAD. The left circumflex (LCX) was the dominant vessel and the AV segment was diffusely dilated and ectatic. The first and second obtuse marginal (OM1 and OM2) were 100% occluded and were noted to fill retrograde. A cutting balloon was unable to cross the area of disease in the both the OM1 and OM2. The obtuse marginal 3 (OM3) had multiple stenotic regions with the worst being 90% occluded and a bare-metal stent was deployed at the location of the near-total occlusion. The posterior descending artery was large and also diffusely atherosclerotic with multiple angiographic stenotic areas of varying severity; the worst located in the distal segments. During follow-up he reported little relief from the stent(s) and presented with angina for the first time.</p>
