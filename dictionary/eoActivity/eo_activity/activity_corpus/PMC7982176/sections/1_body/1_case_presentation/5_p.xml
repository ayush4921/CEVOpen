<p>The patient underwent a cardiac recatheterization in April 2010 to visualize his coronary anatomy, assess the patency of the previous stents, and to place drug-eluting stents in other areas of significant disease, if necessary. The left heart catheterization demonstrated an RMCA with diffuse disease and total distal occlusion, LMCA with 40% occlusion, and an LCX with a fully occluded diagonal OM1 with a patent bare-metal stent in the proximal-OM3. The bare-metal stent in the mid-LAD was also patent. The LAD-1, however, was functionally occluded with poor run-off; it is noted that the vessel originally supplied a large area of myocardium. Drug-eluting stents were not placed, and the patient continued to report significant episodes of pain and discomfort consistent with stable angina.</p>
