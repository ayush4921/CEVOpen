<p>In late October of 2017, the patient sought evaluation for medicinal cannabis (MC). On initial visit, he presented with chronic chest pain due to UA that had not been totally relieved with long-term morphine treatment (morphine instant release [IR], 15 mg/8 h) and cardiac medications (rosuvastatin, amlodipine, clopidogrel, ranolazine, aspirin, carvedilol, lisinopril, and zolpidem; see table supplemental 2, for all medications and dosages [2009–2019]). His chest pain was 3/10 during evaluation but reported it may reach a level of 7/10 and would radiate to the left side of his chest. The patient says he was unable to walk long distances or perform mild/moderate physical activity. His symptoms were usually relieved by rest. He would, however, also experience frequent occurrences of angina unprovoked by physical activity or exertion, thus defining the presence of UA. He was started on MC at that time.</p>
