<p>This case describes a 63-year-old man, former narcotics officer, with a complex cardiac history who first presented 22 years ago after a suspected myocardial infarction (MI). He has a 21-pack year history of smoking, but stopped immediately after his MI. In 2009, the patient re-presented to cardiology and underwent a nuclear stress test demonstrating moderate ischemia in the anterior and anterolateral walls. A subsequent angiogram showed significant calcification in the left main coronary artery (LMCA) and the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD). Disease in the right main coronary artery (RMCA) was also noted. He was referred for a 2D echocardiogram (ECHO) and recatheterization to explore the extent of his coronary artery disease (CAD; see supplemental Table 1, summary of cardiac history [2009–2010] and see supplemental Table 3, which illustrates both the single-photon emission computerized tomography and exercise tolerance test [ETT] findings [2010–2018]).</p>
