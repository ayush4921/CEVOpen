<p>In late November 2017, the patient was seen for his first follow-up and presented with a decrease in the frequency of his chronic pain (CP). He stressed how the pain used to occur a few times/day and is now noticeably less often. He was also able to walk more than he previously was, but he still cannot do any strenuous activity. He was using a combination of high Δ
 <sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and low cannabidiol (CBD) strains (1:340 CBD:THC) (see table, supplemental 4, which displays the various medical cannabis strains used by our patient). It was discussed that he should be decarboxylating his MC and using it in edible form. The patient was able to reduce his morphine dosage from every 8 hours to once per day (q.d. morphine IR, 15 mg).
