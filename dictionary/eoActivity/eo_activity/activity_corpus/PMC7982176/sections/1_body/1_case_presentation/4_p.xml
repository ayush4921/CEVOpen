<p>An ECHO in March of 2010 showed a large wall-motion abnormality in the lateral and inferolateral walls. A low-normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), 40% to 50%, was also noted despite first-line mediations, which were modified for maximal impact and failing. Medications at that time where aspirin 325 mg, clopidogrel 75 mg, atorvastatin 40 mg, niacin 500 mg, omega-3, and carvedilol 3.125 mg (see table supplemental 2, for all medications and dosages [2009–2019]). The atorvastatin was subsequently terminated and rosuvastatin 20 mg was initiated, as was lisinopril 25 mg. The carvedilol was also increased to 6.25 mg (1.5 tabs, daily). These changes in his pharmacologic treatment produced significant results in his functional capacity, as demonstrated by his LVEF of 60% during a cardiac cath later in April 2010.</p>
