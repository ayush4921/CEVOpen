<p>In 2011, the patient underwent a Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) study. Using a modified Bruce protocol, he completed 2 minutes of stage III until he began to experience significant pain. The patient chose to continue the test using regadenoson to ensure complete vasodilation. The EKG showed diffuse 1.5 mm ST depression (see supplemental Table 3, which illustrates both the SPECT and ETT findings [2010–2018]). The ischemic changes first presented at the end of stage III of the modified Bruce protocol and were present up to 4 minutes in the recovery phase; they reversed to baseline after administration of aminophylline. Partial inferior wall scarring was noted; the LVEF was 54%. The Single-photon emission computed tomography ETT myocardial perfusion imaging study showed a mild intensity small-sized ischemic anterior wall defect extending from the mid to basal segments, a large size moderate intensity ischemic defect involving the anterolateral, inferolateral wall extending form the mid to the basal segments, and a small size mild to moderate intensity ischemic defect in the inferior wall. Compared to the prior test from 2010, the apical ischemia was no longer present, and the left ventricular wall hypokinesis was improved.</p>
