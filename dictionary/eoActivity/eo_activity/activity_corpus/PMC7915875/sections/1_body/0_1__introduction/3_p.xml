 <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> provides nutrients that benefit health, making it a key food for food security in areas with fewer economic resources [
 <xref rid="B16-plants-10-00318" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], this review summarises recent knowledge on bioactive compounds from 
 <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> plants and their potential use in the formulation of food products, especially bakery products. The objective of this review is to know the uses and applications of 
 <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> in bakery products, in order to know what the quantity or concentration of 
 <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> is that allows maintaining the sensory characteristics of the product.
