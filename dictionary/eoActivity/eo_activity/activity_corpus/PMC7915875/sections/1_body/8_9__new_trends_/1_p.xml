The study of molecules of protein nature with bioactive effects on human health, such as antiproteolytic, procoagulant, antidiabetic, antihypertensive and anti-inflammatory properties, opens up new strategies for the design of nutritional supplements and the design of functional foods. This plant is also economical in all respects and has been used by many people due to its many advantages. Today, there is a great demand for plant-based medicine, food supplements, health products, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, etc. in the national and global market. However, most of the quality of food supplements has not been well evaluated. In addition, there are some types of conventionally used foods, which have some ethnopharmacological importance, but have not been clinically tested. The main mission of this research is to develop the scientific rationale behind their use. This effort aims to explore the therapeutic uses of a food plant, which has medicinal importance in a wide range. The result shows that the plant provides a tremendous source of micronutrients and macronutrients. Therefore, it can be further explored for the development of nutritional supplements in the future, which may be useful to treat various diseases and thus promote a better quality of life.
