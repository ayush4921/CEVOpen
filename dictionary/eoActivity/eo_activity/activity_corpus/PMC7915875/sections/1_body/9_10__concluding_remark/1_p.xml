<p>Taking into account all the considerations outlined in this review, it is important to note that bioactive compounds from 
 <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> have a potential application in food, especially in bakery products. However, there are scarce results regarding the isolation of phytochemical compounds to identify new natural bioactive agents from 
 <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> plants and to better understand the role of these compounds in the food matrix. The study of these molecules is a starting point for a better understanding of the role in the food matrix and for a correct technological, nutritional and sensory development of functional foods.
