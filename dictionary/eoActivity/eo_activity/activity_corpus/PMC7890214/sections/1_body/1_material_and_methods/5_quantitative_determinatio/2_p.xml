 <italic>C. longa</italic> was performed as described in 
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Pothitirat and Gritsanapan (2006)</xref> with some modifications. For the preparation of the standard solution, standard curcumin (100 mg) (cat # C-75300, purity &gt;95%) was accurately weighed and transferred to a 100 mL volumetric flask. The stock solution was prepared by adding methanol and adjusting to a final volume of 100 mL. Then 2 mL stock solution was added to 25 mL volumetric flask, and the volume was made with methanol. From this solution, concentrations of 1.6, 3.2, 4.8, 6.4 and 8.0 μg/mL were prepared and used for the preparation of the calibration curve.
