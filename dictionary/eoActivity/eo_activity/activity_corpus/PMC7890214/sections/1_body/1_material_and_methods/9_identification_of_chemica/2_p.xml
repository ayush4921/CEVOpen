<p id="p0075">Characterization of chemical components from EO of 
 <italic>Curcuma domestica</italic> was done based on their retention time; retention indices (RI) determined using a homologous series of n-alkanes (C
 <sub>8</sub>â€“C
 <sub>18</sub>) under the same temperature-programmed conditions, co-injection with standards (Aldrich and Fluka). Compounds were identified by comparing their retention indices and mass spectra with National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Wiley, and then by comparing the given mass spectral data with literature data (
