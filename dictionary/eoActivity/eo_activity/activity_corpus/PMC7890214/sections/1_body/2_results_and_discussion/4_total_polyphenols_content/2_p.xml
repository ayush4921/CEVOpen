<p id="p0105">The mean values of TPC in turmeric rhizomes of different varieties are shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. These multiple means comparison results revealed that TPC of Bonga 51/71 and Dame varieties are not significantly different from each other at the 5% level of significance. The two highest TPCs were found in Dame (97.55 mg GAE/g) and Bonga 51/71 (96.52 mg GAE/g), whereas the lowest was found in HT3/2002 (83.21 mg GAE/g). This difference among varieties is in line with a previous study by 
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Tanvir et al. (2017)</xref> who reported that different turmeric varieties cultivated in Bangladesh gave different TPC. A similar pattern was obtained in Japan (
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Akter et al., 2019</xref>) where the minimum (37.9) and the maximum (157.4) mg GAE/g TPC were obtained from a methanolic extract of 
 <italic>C. aromatica</italic> and Ryudai gold turmeric varieties, respectively.
