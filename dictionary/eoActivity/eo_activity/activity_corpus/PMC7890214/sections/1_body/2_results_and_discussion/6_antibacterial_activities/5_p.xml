 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> shows the quantitative antibacterial activity of essential oils and methanol extracts from three varieties of 
 <italic>Curcuma domestica</italic> against the 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. It is visible in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> that, unlike EOs, there is no significant difference among the mean inhibition zones of the three varieties when the type of extract is methanol. In this study, EO was more effective than methanol extracts within each turmeric variety. A more potent inhibition was achieved from EO of Dame (16.85 mm) followed by HT3/2002 (15.15 mm). Methanol extract from HT3/2002 showed a minimal inhibitory zone (12.90 mm). Our results agree with those obtained by 
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al. (2002)</xref> regarding the minimal inhibition zone exhibited by methanol extracts than EOs. A critical review by 
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Shahidi and Hossain (2018)</xref> revealed that the reduced potential toxicity of methanol extract against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> was due to poor solubility and low bioavailability of curcumin in the extract. In this case, 
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Teow et al. (2016)</xref> suggested that the addition of antibiotics or combination with several phytochemicals such as cinnamaldehyde, ellagic acid, and eugenol with curcuminoids/curcumin could create a synergistic antibacterial effect on 
 <italic>S. aureus.</italic>
