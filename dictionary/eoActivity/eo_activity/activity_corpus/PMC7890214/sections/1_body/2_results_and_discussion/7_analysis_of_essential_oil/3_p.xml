<p id="p0160">This study also reveals a new insight into the chemical composition of essential oil from turmeric varieties cultivated in Ethiopia. When our results are compared with those of 
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Oyemitan et al. (2017)</xref>, there is a high level of similarity with the most abundant components of the volatile oil obtained from 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> rhizome in Ondo (Nigeria) (i.e., oxygenated sesquiterpenes with α-Turmerone [35.9%], curlone [12.9%], and ar-turmerone [10.0%]). However, their finding on α-phellandrene (15.5%) was very different from ours (0.57–0.41%).
