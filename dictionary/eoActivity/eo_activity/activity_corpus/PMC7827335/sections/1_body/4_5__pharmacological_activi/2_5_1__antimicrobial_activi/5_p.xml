<p>Collectively, it can be concluded that the antimicrobial properties of 
 <italic>Parkia</italic> plants depend on the species and parts of 
 <italic>Parkia</italic> as well as solvent (polar and non-polar). Most of the published report are in in vitro evaluations, which do not assure the same outcomes in animal models and clinical setting. In the rise of resistant pathogenic bacteria to antimicrobial therapy, it is an urgent need to develop new antimicrobial agents, and phytoconstituents from plants like 
 <italic>Parkia</italic> could be good candidates.
