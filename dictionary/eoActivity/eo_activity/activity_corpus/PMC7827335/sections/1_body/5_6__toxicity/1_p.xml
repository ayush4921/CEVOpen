<p>Daily consumption of cooked pods of 
 <italic>P. roxburghii</italic> does not impose any significant adverse effect [
 <xref rid="B218-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">218</xref>]. However, eating raw pods may result in bad breath owing to its rich content in volatile disulfide compounds, which are exhaled in breath and the odor can persist for several hours (Meyer, 1987). Many substances have been identified or isolated from 
 <italic>Parkia</italic> seed, such as lectins, non-protein amino acids, and alkaloids [
 <xref rid="B219-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">219</xref>]. However, no acute mortality and observable behavioral change were recorded at doses up to 2000 mg/kg ethyl acetate fraction of 
 <italic>P. roxburghii</italic> pod in rats [
 <xref rid="B18-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Investigation on acute and sub-acute toxicity profiles of the aqueous and ethanol extracts of the stem bark of 
 <italic>P. biglobosa</italic> showed that the oral median lethal dose (LD
 <sub>50</sub>) was higher than 5000 mg/kg for both extracts in rats [
 <xref rid="B36-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, in another report, LD
 <sub>50</sub> values of the leaves, stems and roots in an acute toxicity study were within the range of 500â€“5000 mg/kg body weight of fish, suggesting that they are only slightly toxic and, therefore, not potentially dangerous. The adverse effects included respiratory distress and agitated behavior [
 <xref rid="B220-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">220</xref>]. Apart from the barks of 
 <italic>P. biglobosa</italic>, the pods also possess the piscicidal activity that can be used in the management and control of fishponds to eliminate predators [

 <xref rid="B221-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">221</xref>]. Fatty acids and oils identified from the seeds of 
 <italic>P. biglobosa</italic> and 
 <italic>P. bicolor</italic> were reported to be non-toxic [
