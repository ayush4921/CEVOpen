<p>To date, few terpenoid compounds have been reported in 
 <italic>Parkia</italic> plants. Most of these compounds were identified from barks, roots, leaves, and seeds of 
 <italic>Parkia</italic> plants. One is monoterpenoid 
 <bold>50</bold> with two of its glucosides 
 <bold>57</bold> and 
 <bold>58</bold>, a diterpene 
 <bold>49</bold>, while the rest are triterpenoid 
 <bold>49</bold> and 
 <bold>51</bold>–
 <bold>56</bold> (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00618-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Seven out of the triterpenoids 
 <bold>52</bold>–
 <bold>58</bold> were reported as new compounds. Only 
 <bold>49</bold> is reported in three species (
 <italic>P. biglobosa</italic>, 
 <italic>P. bicolor</italic>, and 
 <italic>P. speciosa</italic>). Two of the new compounds 
 <bold>57</bold> and 
 <bold>58</bold> are iridoid type of terpenoidal glycoside purified from methanol extract of 
 <italic>P. javanica</italic>, together with ursolic acid and other steroidal compounds [
 <xref rid="B42-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Compounds 
 <bold>52</bold>–
 <bold>56</bold> are isolated through different chromatographic techniques from 80% methanol extract of 
 <italic>P. bicolor</italic> root, with a known diterpene 
 <bold>59</bold> and a benzene glucoside 
 <bold>105</bold>. These compounds are reported to exhibit moderate antiproliferative activity with median inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) ranging from 48.89 ± 0.16 to 81.66 ± 0.17 µM [
