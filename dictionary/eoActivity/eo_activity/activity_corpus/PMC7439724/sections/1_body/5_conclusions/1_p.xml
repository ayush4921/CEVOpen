<p id="Par40">DMMs have long maintained, currently have, and will continue to maintain a good reputation on the basis of their excellent curative effects. In our review, DMM is the specific term for pure, superior medicinal herbs with the following characteristics: optimum harvest season (reflecting the appropriate developmental stage of the plant), scrupulous processing, traditional preparation technology, etc. Historical literature, modern phytochemical and pharmacological methods have provided additional scientific data and a theoretical basis to validate the mechanisms of DMMs. In addition, every procedure in the production chain of CMMs should be standardized to guarantee the prominent curative effect of medicinal materials. Effectively establishing a correlation among the active components, clinical efficacy and identity of DMMs is an important aspect in the quality evaluation of CMMs. The core scientific elucidation of DMMs should be continuously carried out, and multidisciplinary measures should be adopted to explore scientific and practical methodologies for the further research of DMMs. </p>
