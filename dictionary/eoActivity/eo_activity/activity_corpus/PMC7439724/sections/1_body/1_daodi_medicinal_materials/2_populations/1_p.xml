<p id="Par29">Different growing environments may greatly influence the quality and chemical components of closely related populations. Modern experimental research, especially molecular biological identification, has validated that the different production areas of CMMs are closely related to the quality and DNA sequence divergence of CMMs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. For example, as the dominant constituents, patchoulol and pogostone are the basis for the anti-inflammatory activity of 
 <italic>Pogostemon cablin</italic> (Blanco) Benth. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. And it has been found that pogostone also exhibits potent anti-fungal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], antiapoptotic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], antioxidant [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and immunosuppressive [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] properties. In our previous study, 
 <italic>P. cablin</italic> produced in Shipai (in Guangzhou city, Guangdong province, SP) and Gaoyao (in Zhaoqing city, Guangdong province, GY) differed from 
 <italic>P. cablin</italic> cultivated in Hainan province (HN) and Zhanjiang city (in Guangdong province, ZJ) not only in the total amount of volatile oil but also in genotype [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. According to the composition of the volatile oil, 
 <italic>P. cablin</italic> is divided into two chemotypes: SP and GY cultivars belong to the pogostone-type, while the HN and ZJ cultivars belong to the patchoulol-type (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Moreover, we have demonstrated that the sequence divergence of both the 
 <italic>mat</italic>K and 18S rRNA genes among 6 samples of 
 <italic>P. cablin</italic> from different locations was well correlated with the regions of cultivation and intraspecific essential oil chemotypes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The same is true for other medicinal herbs. The major pharmacological components in 
 <italic>Cnidium monnieri</italic> (L.) Cuss. are coumarins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Similarly, according to the coumarin chemotypes, 
 <italic>C. monnieri</italic> has been classified into three chemotypes, the osthol-linear furanocoumarins-type (chemotype I), principally cultivated in regions of Jiangsu and Hunan provinces; the angular furanocoumarins-type (chemotype II), mainly produced in Heilongjiang province; and the transition-type (chemotype III), largely came from Henan and Hebei regions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. It was found that there were 12 variable sites in the 
 <italic>mat</italic>K gene sequence of 
 <italic>C. monnieri</italic> from different populations. A phylogenetic tree constructed by the neighbor-joining (NJ) method showed that the phylogenetic relationship of 6 
 <italic>C. monnieri</italic> cultivars was well correlated with their geographical distribution and intraspecific coumarin chemotypes of (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Likewise, Laboratory research showed a clear correlation between the rDNA ITS sequence and the phenotype of 
 <italic>Dendrobium officinale</italic> Kimura et Migo from different populations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The phylogenetic relationship predicted by the 5S rRNA spacer region data correlated well with the essential oil chemotype of 
 <italic>Acorus calamus</italic> L. collected from various locations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, the difference in the alkaloid content of 
 <italic>Fritillaria thunbergii</italic> Miq. from various habitats did not result from variation in the 5S rRNA sequence but from the microenvironment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. It’s reported that 5S rRNA is highly-conserved arcoss all species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], thus, different environments did not produce changes in 5S rRNA of different 
 <italic>F. thunbergii</italic> populations, but produced differences in secondary metabolites. In these cases, it can be concluded that genetic diversity existed among different populations is relevant to the cultivation regions except some highly-conserved DNA markers.
