<p id="Par31">Sunshine is an important factor for the formation of DMMs. For example, the content of volatile components in 
 <italic>Houttuynia cordata</italic> Thunb. was closely related to light intensity: monoterpenoids and nonterpenoids were positively and negatively associated with light intensity, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In 
 <italic>Viola yedoensis</italic> Makino, the content of flavonoids and coumarins was positively correlated with light intensity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Although it has been demonstrated that higher concentrations of total patchoulol corresponded to lower light intensity in 
 <italic>P. cablin</italic>, there was no statistically significant correlation between patchoulol content and shade [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In recent years, circadian clocks that temporally organize many aspects of growth and metabolism have even been found in numerous plant species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. For example, in 
 <italic>Antirrhinum majus</italic> L., 
 <italic>monoterpene synthase</italic> mRNA levels and corresponding monoterpene emission, which followed diurnal rhythms, were controlled by a circadian clock [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. A similar daily fluctuation was found in the endogenous level of geranyl acetate and in the expression of its biosynthetic gene, 
 <italic>alcohol acetyl transferase</italic> in 
 <italic>Rosa rugosa</italic> Thunb. [
