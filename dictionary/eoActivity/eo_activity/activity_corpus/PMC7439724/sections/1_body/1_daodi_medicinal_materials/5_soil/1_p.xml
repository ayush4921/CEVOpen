<p id="Par32">Soil is also important for the identification of DMMs and for the evaluation of quality. Modern pharmacologic studies have proven that the specific composition of soil has a large influence on the quality and quantity of the chemicals in medicinal herbs. For example, soil available iron (Fe) could promote the accumulation of flavonoids, while soil available manganese (Mn), total potassium (K), and available K had an inhibitory effect on flavonoid content in

 <italic>Citrus grandis</italic> ‘Tomentosa’, the content of soil available copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), Mn, boron (B), and molybdenum (Mo) was positively associated with flavonoid concentrations and naringin concentrations [

 <italic>Schisandra sphenanthera</italic> Rehd. et Wils., as a significant correlation was also found between these factors [
