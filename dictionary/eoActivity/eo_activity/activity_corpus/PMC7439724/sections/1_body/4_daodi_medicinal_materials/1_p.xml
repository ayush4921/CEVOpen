<p id="Par39">CMMs are the materials processed into decoction ingredients or used to produce proprietary drugs. The identification of DMMs is important in quality evaluation and disease treatment. In addition to the optimum harvest season, the processing and standard prescription of CMMs produce the unique characteristics of DMMs, and a plausible production chain of CMMs is hypothesized in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>. The production chain of CMMs is based on the content we described above, including populations, designated growing regions (
 <italic>daodi</italic>), and harvest season, as well as the extensive quality control knowledge accumulated for CMMs by Liu et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. Compared to previous production chain of CMMs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>], factors such as populations, designated growing regions and harvest time directly influenced the quality of CMMs were emphasized. Every procedure in the production chain should be standardized to guarantee the prominent curative effect of medicinal materials. For example, the manufacturing procedure for 
 <italic>Pinellia ternata</italic> (Thunb.) Breit. was standardized by orthogonal design [

 <italic>Coptis chinensis</italic> Franch. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>], 
 <italic>Xanthium sibiricum</italic> Patr. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>], 
 <italic>Siegesbeckia orientalis</italic> L. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>], 
 <italic>Descurainia sophia</italic> (L.) Webb. ex Prantl. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>], 
 <italic>Cassia obtusifolia</italic> L. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>], etc. Additionally, cooperation among universities, research institutes and pharmaceutical manufacturers should be strengthened to communicate information regarding CMMs.
