<p id="Par24">In recent years, as the use of Chinese medicinal materials (CMMs) has increased, the international attention paid to the safety, stability and efficacy of CMMs has increased. Some authentic and superior CMMs that are grown in specific regions and widely recognized as having better therapeutic effects are called 
 <italic>daodi</italic> medicinal materials (DMMs) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. DMMs, based on the theory, origin, processing, and prominent curative effect of CMMs, are the essence of Chinese cultural heritage [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. DMMs were first recorded in 
 <italic>Zhen Zhu Nang Yao Xing Fu</italic> (Precious Drus in Rhyme), a book written 700 years ago. The term “
 <italic>daodi</italic> medicinal material” is widely found in 
 <italic>Ben Cao Pin Hui Jing Yao</italic> (Essentials of Materia Medica Distinctions), a book compiled by the Imperial Hospital during the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644 A.D.), in which 268 medicinal herbals are listed. The entry “original source” was formally listed under each medicinal herb heading, specifying 
 <italic>daodi</italic> production regions. It has been suggested that the quality of CMMs is highly correlated with their geographical origins. In ancient times, the identification of DMMs was commonly carried out based on the characteristics of the superficies, and this approach depended to a certain extent on empirical experiences and assumptions. Currently, modern scientific analytical techniques may be applied to confirm the validity of associations between high-quality medicinal products and DMM to ensure their utility, clarifying the scientific understanding of 
 <italic>daodi</italic> medicinal materials.
