<p id="Par27">DMM can be very effective if proper consideration is given to the characteristics of the original sources, growth and seasonal changes of the material; however, the same medicinal herb grown in different areas does not have the same effectiveness even if they are the same plant. In China, traditional Chinese medicine doctors usually select a superior populations or variety to prescribe based on geographical features. In addition, different harvest times or processing methods can greatly influence the quality of CMMs in terms of chemical components and pharmacological functions. Thus, DMM, as an authentic and superior medicinal product, needs to be validated by modern analytical methods for each CMM. In this paper, the scientific elucidation of DMMs will be introduced, as well as a putative production chain for processing traditional, experience-based CMMs.</p>
