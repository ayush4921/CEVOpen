<p id="Par25">The word “
 <italic>dao</italic>” (in “
 <italic>daodi</italic>”) is an ancient Chinese unit of measurement used to divide administrative districts, and this term can be retraced to the Eastern Han Dynasty (25–220 A.D.) as described in 
 <italic>Hou Han Shu</italic> (Book of Later Han, 432–445 A.D.) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In the Tang Dynasty (618–907 A.D.), the nation was divided into 10 “
 <italic>dao</italic>” according to landscapes in the 
 <italic>Zhenguan</italic> Period, and then the number was increased to 15 “
 <italic>dao</italic>” in the 
 <italic>Kaiyuan</italic> Period. Currently, “
 <italic>dao</italic>” is conceptually similar to the modern organizational system of provinces. The word “
 <italic>di</italic>” (in “
 <italic>daodi</italic>”) refers to regions and geography. Nowadays, “
 <italic>daodi</italic> medicinal materials” refers to the distinctively higher quality of the medicinal materials that grow in a certain area.
