<p id="Par38">Pharmacological functions are actually the outside manifestations of CMMs. In the case of DMMs, the conditions in a certain region are thought to confer clinical superiority, and for this reason, DMMs are considered the most efficacious among CMMs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Scientific evidence supporting the alleged clinical superiority of DMMs is the subject of ongoing research. For example, 
 <italic>Dendrobium huoshanense</italic> C. Z. Tang et S. J. Cheng produced in Huoshan (in Anhui province) is considered to be superior in quality. Accordingly, the hepatoprotective effect is the best for the Huoshan cultivar, second for the Yunnan cultivar, and last for the other region cultivars [

 <italic>P. cablin</italic> has been classified into two chemotypes, the patchoulol-type, including cultivars HN and ZJ, and the pogostone-type, including cultivars SP and GY. Accordingly, this cultivars produced in GY are more potent than those from ZJ in terms of promoting digestion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>] and antibacterial [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>] effects. In addition, the toxicity of DMMs is often less potent than that of non-DMMs. For instance, 
 <italic>P. multiflorum</italic> is principally cultivated in region Deqing county of Guangdong province, which has the largest output and the longest history of medicinal use. Accordingly, cultivar Deqing showed less potent cytotoxicity than cultivar Chongqing in HepG2 and LO2 cells [
