<p id="Par37">As we described above, ecological environments such as topography, sunshine, soil, and water directly influence the secondary metabolites (many of which are bioactive components) in medicinal herbs. The many names of DMMs reflect the connotations of production regions; for instance, “
 <italic>qin pi</italic>” (
 <italic>Fraxinus chinensis</italic> Roxb.), “
 <italic>fen qi</italic>” (
 <italic>Astragalus membranaceus</italic> (Fisch.) Bge.), “
 <italic>huai di huang</italic>” (
 <italic>Rehmannia glutinosa</italic> Libosch.) and “
 <italic>ba dou</italic>” (
 <italic>Croton tiglium</italic> L.), where “
 <italic>qin</italic>”, “
 <italic>fen</italic>”, “
 <italic>huai</italic>”, and “
 <italic>ba</italic>” refer to the names of regions used over the course of ancient Western Zhou Dynasty (1046–771 B.C.) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Modern experimental research has validated that DMMs growing in a certain production region are often of high quality (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). For example, the ancient Chinese medicine book 
 <italic>Xin Xiu Ben Cao</italic> (Newly Revised Materia Medica, 659 A.D.) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] said that “
 <italic>Fraxinus chinensis</italic> Roxb., which can change the color of water to a fluorescent color after soaking, is thought to be superior in quality” (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Currently, scientific evidence supporting the rational for such description is available. 
 <italic>F. chinensis</italic> produced from Shaanxi province has a higher content of aesculin and aesculetin than that produced in Sichuan province and Liaoning province, and its stronger fluorescence reaction is consistent with the description written in ancient times [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. The same observation is true for 
 <italic>Astragalus membranaceus</italic> (Fisch.) Bge. This herb is principally cultivated in a region in Shanxi province, and the cultivar produced in this region contains more astragaloside than do cultivars produced in Shandong, Inner Mongolia, Hebei and Jilin provinces [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. It is generally recognized that 
 <italic>Rehmannia glutinosa</italic> Libosch. cultivated in Henan province is of particularly high quality. Modern experimental studies have demonstrated that higher levels of the active constituent catalpol content are present in 
 <italic>R. glutinosa</italic> grown in this region than in cultivars grown in areas of Xianyang (in Shaanxi province) and Dali (in Shaanxi province) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Similarly, 
 <italic>A. villosum</italic> cultivated in Yangchun (in Guangdong province) is believed to be superior in quality. The effective medicinal elements in 
 <italic>A. villosum</italic> is bornyl acetate. Modern experimental research has validated that Yangchun-cultivated 
 <italic>A. villosum</italic> has the highest effective component content among different populations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. In other example, 
 <italic>P. cablin</italic> cultivated in Shipai (in Guangzhou city, Guangdong province) is of particularly high quality. It produced higher levels of the active constituent pogostone than that cultivated in Gaoyao (in Zhaoqing city, Guangdong province), Leizhou (in Zhanjiang city, Guangdong province), Wuchuan (in Zhanjiang city, Guangdong province) and Hainan province [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Interestingly, the same is true for toxicology. 
 <italic>A. carmichaelii</italic> produced from plantation sites at Jiangyou county of Sichuan province is believed to be superior in quality. The proportions of the major bioactive constituents monoester alkaloids to toxic constituents diester alkaloids amount among 5 samples of 
 <italic>A. carmichaelii</italic> from different localities were well correlative with their regions of cultivation. The highest proportion occurred in cultivar Jiangyou (in Sichuan province), followed by cultivars Hanzhong (in Shaaxi province), Butuo (in Sichuan province), Weishan (in Yunnan province), and Anxian (in Sichuan province) [
