<p>Obtained biocellulose films were washed with distilled water, and then incubated in 1% NaOH at 90 °C for 45 min to remove bacterial cells and medium components. After this stage, the films were neutralized with acetic acid and washed with distilled water [

After sterilization, BC films were dried at 23 °C under laminar chamber. Thicknesses of each sample of BC from two different strains of acetic bacteria were measured at 10 different positions, using thickness gauge. The results were expressed as the mean values of ten determinations of the BC membranes [
