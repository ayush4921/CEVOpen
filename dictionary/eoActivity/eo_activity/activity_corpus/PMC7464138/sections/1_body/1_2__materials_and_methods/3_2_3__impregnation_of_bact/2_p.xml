<p>BC discs after impregnation with OEO were weighed on an analytical balance (accurate to 0.0001 g, Radwag, Warsaw, Poland). OEO holding capacity was calculated by the formula (1) [
 <xref rid="B40-polymers-12-01647" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]:
 <disp-formula>OEO holding capacity (%) = (W
  <sub>h</sub> − W
  <sub>d</sub>)/W
  <sub>d</sub> × 100
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula> where W
 <sub>h</sub> is the weight of the hydrate BC disc and W
 <sub>d</sub> is the weight of the dry BC disc; each measurement was carried out in triplicate.
