<p>The antibacterial activity of BC impregnated with OEO was tested against five strains of 
 <italic>Cronobacter</italic> sp. using the disc diffusion method. Bacterial inoculum was prepared from overnight culture on soybean agar with tryptone (TSA, Argenta, Poznan, Poland). Colonies were openly suspended in 0.85% physiological salt to obtain a turbidity comparable to the McFarland standard turbidity of 0.5 (approximately 8 log CFU mL
 <sup>−1</sup>). Aliquots (0.1 mL) were distributed over the surface of pre-dried tryptone soy agar plates using a sterile swabs. BC discs and discs of filter paper with an OEO and negative control without essential oil were placed onto plates with seeded bacteria and incubated for 24 h at 35 °C according to our previous methods [

The diameters of the inhibition zones were measured in triplicate in millimeters using an electronic caliper. The measurement scale was as follows: strong inhibition zone of inhibition ≥ 20 mm (including disc diameter), moderate inhibition zone &lt; 20–12 mm, and no inhibition zone &lt; 12 mm. All analysis were carried out in triplicate. Valuesare presented as mean ± standard deviation.
