<p>As an antimicrobial agent for impregnating the biocellulose films, undiluted volumes of OEO was used (origanum oil, Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany, W282812, 100% pure essential oil). For impregnation of BC, discs were immersed in 5 mL OEO for 24 h at 23 Â°C in a tightly closed container to prevent evaporation of the oil. The discs were then taken out and wiped in sterile filter paper to remove the non-absorbed oil. Pure BC discs without oregano essential oil were used as a negative control and sterile filter paper with OEO as a positive control [
