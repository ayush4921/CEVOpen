 <italic>C. condimenti</italic> s37, 
 <italic>C. muytjensii</italic> s50, 
 <italic>C. sakazakii</italic> lv27, 
 <italic>C. turicensis</italic> lv53, and 
 <italic>C. malonaticus</italic> lv31. Those strains were isolated by our team from market products of plant origin [
 <xref rid="B35-polymers-12-01647" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The tested strains were stored at −48 °C. Prior to use, they were grown freshly on a tryptone soya broth (TSB, Argenta, Poznan, Poland) according to reference [
