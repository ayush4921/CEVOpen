<p>The use of essential oils (EOs) or natural plant-derived compounds as food additives could be one of the possible ways to control 
 <italic>Cronobacter</italic> spp. in various types of food products. The use of natural essential oils inscribes well into the “clean label” trend and allows a reduction to some extent of the amounts of chemical preserving agents. The literature data on the susceptibility of 
 <italic>Cronobacter</italic> genus bacteria to inhibitory effects of EOs are limited and they mainly concern the 
 <italic>C. sakazakii</italic> bacteria species. There are insufficient scientific reports that have investigated the inhibitory effects of several EOs and carvacrol, thymol, eugenol, and cinnamic acid/trans-cinnamaldehyde against 
 <italic>C. sakazakii</italic> and 
 <italic>C. malonaticus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B32-polymers-12-01647" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The knowledge about the potential susceptibility of other species from the genus 
 <italic>Cronobacter</italic> to EOs and active substances of plant origin is still very scanty.
