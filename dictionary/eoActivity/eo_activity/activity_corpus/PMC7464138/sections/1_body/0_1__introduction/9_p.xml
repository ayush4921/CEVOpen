<p>Bacteria genus 
 <italic>Cronobacter</italic> spp. have been isolated from food and environmental, human, and clinical sources. 
 <italic>Cronobacter</italic> can occur in a wide variety of foods including plant materials, infant formula, cheese, dried foods and meats as well as water. [
 <xref rid="B23-polymers-12-01647" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The genus of 
 <italic>Cronobacter</italic> has been associated with rare but life-threatening diseases mainly in newborns and infants including meningitis, septicemia, and necrotizing enterocolitis [

 <xref rid="B25-polymers-12-01647" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], but also in the elderly and immunocompromised adults including pneumonia, septicemia, osteomyelitis, splenic abscesses, and wound infections [

 <xref rid="B27-polymers-12-01647" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. According to the molecular identification, the genus 
 <italic>Cronobacter</italic> consists of seven species: 
 <italic>C. sakazakii, C. turicensis s, C. malonaticus, C. condimenti, C. dublinensis, C. muytjensii</italic>, and

 <xref rid="B29-polymers-12-01647" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The first three are the most frequently isolated from human infections [
 <xref rid="B30-polymers-12-01647" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The recently reclassified species are 
 <italic>C. zurichensis, C. helveticus, C. colletis</italic>, and
