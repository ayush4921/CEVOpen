<p>The main goal of this research was to study the antimicrobial activity of bacterial cellulose produced by 
 <italic>Gluconacetobacter hansenii</italic> ATCC 23769 and 
 <italic>Komagataeibacter</italic> sp. GH1 soaked with oregano essential oil against strains representing the genus of 
 <italic>Cronobacter</italic>. The indirect aim was to check whether BC with OEO could in the future be an effective material for the production of active food packaging that could extend the shelf life of some products by preventing the growing of 
 <italic>Cronobacter</italic> bacteria.
