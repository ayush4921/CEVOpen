<p>Based on this study, it was concluded that bacterial cellulose impregnated with oregano essential oil has strong and moderate antimicrobial activity against all presented strains of the genus 
 <italic>Cronobacter</italic> isolated from plant matrix. Bacterial cellulose of strain 
 <italic>Komagataeibacter</italic> sp. GH1 was a better carrier of oregano essential oil as it has the best antagonistic activity compared to bacterial cellulose obtained from 
 <italic>G. hansenii</italic> ATCC 23769 and strength compared to filter paper. Based on this conclusion, bacterial cellulose of strain 
 <italic>Komagataeibacter</italic> sp. GH1 can be further investigated as food packaging to improve the safety and shelf-life of food.
