<p>Based on these results, it is worth providing similar research based on antimicrobial properties of bacterial cellulose with oregano essential oil. The next stage of research will concern the design of active packaging based on bacterial cellulose with oregano oil and carrying out load tests on the example of ready-to-eat vegetable lettuce. The obtained results give hope that in the future, it will be possible to replace synthetic materials (which are not environmentally friendly) with biodegradable materials such as bacterial cellulose enriched with active substances.</p>
