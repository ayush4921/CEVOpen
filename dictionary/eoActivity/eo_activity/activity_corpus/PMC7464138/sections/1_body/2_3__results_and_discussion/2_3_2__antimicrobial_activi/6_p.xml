<p>Although the filter paper soaked in OEO showed greater antimicrobial activity, the aim of the research undertaken was to strive to develop an active packaging prototype based on natural polymer. The research described in this manuscript provides valuable information that it is possible to soak bacterial cellulose with a natural biologically active substance and such a combination has a strong effect on inhibiting the growth of 
 <italic>Cronobacter</italic> bacteria. BC is insoluble in water, unlike traditional paper, and has a definite advantage in mechanical strength. This is sufficient argument to continue work on the use of BC with OEO as active biodegradable packaging intended for contact with food.
