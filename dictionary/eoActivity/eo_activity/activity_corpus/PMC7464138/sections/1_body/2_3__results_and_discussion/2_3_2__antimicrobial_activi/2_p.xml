<p>It was found that BC films and filter paper impregnated with OEO showed a strong and moderate inhibition zone of inhibition against all five 
 <italic>Cronobacter</italic> strains and the diameter was from 13.6 ± 0.8 to 36.0 ± 0.7 mm. Filter paper showed definitely better inhibition properties of test strain growth in comparison with BC in the case of 
 <italic>C. condimenti</italic> s37, 
 <italic>C. muytjensii</italic> s50, and 
 <italic>C. sakazakii</italic> lv27 (36.0 ± 0.7; 35.8 ± 0.9; 33.5 ± 1.5, respectively) (
 <xref rid="polymers-12-01647-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). However, in the case of 
 <italic>C. turicensis</italic> lv53 as well as 
 <italic>C. malonaticus</italic> lv31, the diameter of zone inhibitions caused by soaked filter paper was smaller than with using impregned BC obtained from 
 <italic>Komagataeibacter</italic> sp. GH1 (
 <xref rid="polymers-12-01647-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Similar antimicrobial activity of OEO in the paper disc diffusion assay was obtained against 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>, 
 <italic>Eschericha coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Brochothrix thermosphacta</italic>, and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic>. It was shown that the zone of inhibition of 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> was 14.1 ± 0.8 mm [
 <xref rid="B45-polymers-12-01647" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], which was two times less than that of 
 <italic>Cronobacter condimenti</italic> 32.75 ± 2.8 mm BC of GH1 in our study. It was shown that BC produced by 
 <italic>Komogataeibacter</italic> sp. GH1, impregnated with OEO, showed a strong antimicrobial effect against all 
 <italic>Cronobacter</italic> strains from 16.39 ± 0.7 mm to 32.75 ± 2.8 mm and the inhibition zones were similar against 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> 16.3 ± 0.09 mm, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> 26.8 ± 0.08 mm, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> 16.8 ± 0.09 mm, 
 <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> 16.5 ± 0.07 mm, 
 <italic>Salmonella choleraesius</italic> 29.0 ± 0.08 mm [
 <xref rid="B46-polymers-12-01647" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], and against 
 <italic>Citrobacter</italic> spp. 24.0 ± 0.5 mm, 
 <italic>Salmonella Typhi</italic> 22.4 ± 1.5 mm, and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> 19.0 ± 2.2 mm [
