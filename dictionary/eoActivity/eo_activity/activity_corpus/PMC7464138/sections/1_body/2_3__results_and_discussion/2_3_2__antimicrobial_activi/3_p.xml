<p>Bacterial cellulose obtained from 
 <italic>Komagataeibacter</italic> sp. GH1 soaked with oregano essential oils showed better inhibition properties in comparison with the bacterial cellulose obtained from 
 <italic>G. hansenii.</italic> This fact is probably connected with the thickness of each biopolymer, which was in a range of approximately 30–45 ± 0.2 μm for 
 <italic>Komagataeibacter</italic> sp. GH1 and about 20–28 ± 0.4 μm for 
 <italic>G. hansenii</italic>. It was shown that the thickness of bacterial cellulose can be different for each strain, even while keeping the same cultivation conditions. This parameter depends on calcium source and general medium components, strain and methods of drying [

Despite the cultivation of acetic bacteria under the same conditions and for the same period of time, the thickness of the membrane varied. You-Jin et al. demonstrated that the longer the cultivation time, the thicker the cellulose membrane and the better the absorption properties, so in the future, the cultivation time should be lengthened to obtain a more inhibitory effect [
