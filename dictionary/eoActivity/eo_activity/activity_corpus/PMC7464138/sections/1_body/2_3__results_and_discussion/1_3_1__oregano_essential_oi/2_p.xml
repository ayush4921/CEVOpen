<p>As a result of the work, it was determined that the BC films impregnated with OEO had good holding capacity. BC from the strain 
 <italic>Komagataeibacter</italic> sp. GH1 was able to better absorb and retain OEO compared to BC produced by the 
 <italic>G. hansenii</italic> ATCC 23769. Obtained results showed that BC from ATCC 23769 strain had less holding capacity, but it made this sample more predictable and consistent. It is likely that this difference in OEO holding capacity resulted from different arrangements of cellulose fibers as well as pore size and pore volume [

BC samples were dried at different periods of time, although the same drying method was used, but no ambient humidity was measured. Based on the literature data, it can be assumed that this could have been a factor influencing the difference in holding capacity between BC obtained from ATCC 23769 and from GH1 strains [
