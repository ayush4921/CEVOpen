<p>Based on the obtained results, it can be concluded that the biologically active components of OEO can exhibit antimicrobial activity against several pathogenic bacteria. The largest diameter of the inhibition zone was observed in all samples with OEO against the 
 <italic>C. condimenti</italic> s37 strain. However, filter paper as a carrier had higher inhibition zones compared to BC, but it should be taken into account that BC has higher mechanical strength compared to plant cellulose, so it is worth using this biomaterial in further research [

In bacterial cellulose, the type Iα content is approximately 60%, while that in cotton is 30%. BC has the best water-holding ability of 98%, while plant cellulose is 60% [
