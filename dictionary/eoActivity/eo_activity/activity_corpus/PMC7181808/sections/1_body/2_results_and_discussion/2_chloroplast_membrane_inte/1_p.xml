 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>
 </sup>. This was observed here, where both 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> species grown under water stress exhibited a significant increase in H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> generation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). However, melatonin treatments significantly compensated for oxidative damage caused by the water stress in both 
 <italic>Salvia nemorosa</italic> and 
 <italic>Salvia reuterana</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The protective role of melatonin may be due to its effect in maintaining a steady state of intracellular ROS concentrations, thereby reducing membrane damage from drought stress

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>
 </sup>. Our results are consistent with those reported in other studies using 
 <italic>Cucumis sativus</italic> L. seedlings

 </sup> and grapevines
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>
 </sup> under water and salinity stress. Lipid peroxidation expressed as MDA accumulation is a good representation of the oxidative damage in plants. Therefore, the increased MDA production as a result of water stress (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) can be considered as evidence of oxidative plant stress leading to cell production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> generation
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>
 </sup>. This was further evidenced by the increase in electrolyte leakage in response to increasing deficit irrigation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Similar to H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, melatonin treatment had a significant effect on mitigating MDA production and EL in both 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> species (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Meng 
 <italic>et al</italic>.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>
 </sup> reported that under water stress conditions, grapevines leaves of melatonin-treated cuttings accumulated less MDA and had lower relative electrolytic leakage than cuttings that did not receive any melatonin treatment. As expected, the negative effects of mild and severe water stress (60 and 40% FC, respectively) on the quantum efficiency of Photosystem II (
 <italic>Fv/Fm</italic>) were significantly reduced in 
 <italic>Salvia reuterana</italic> when compared to 
 <italic>Salvia nemorosa</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). These results are consistent with Huang 
 <italic>et al</italic>.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>
 </sup> and Ahmad 
 <italic>et al</italic>.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>
 </sup> who reported that melatonin application alleviated the negative effects of oxidative stress and ROS production. Even at mild water stress (60% FC), a reduced 
 <italic>Fv/Fm</italic> ratio was recorded in the two species, and a more intense water stress (40% FC) had a further negative effect on this physiological parameter (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). However, both 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> species sprayed with melatonin reported a positive response, with an improved ratio of 
 <italic>Fv/Fm</italic> under water stress (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In accordance with the results reported by Wang 
 <italic>et al</italic>.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>
 </sup>, melatonin has the potential to maintain high photosynthetic efficiency in plants and our results proved that melatonin application relieved water stress improving the efficiency of 
 <italic>Fv/Fm</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In support of our findings, melatonin has been already reported that improves electron transport in chloroplast under different environmental stresses
 <sup>

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>
 </sup> and consequently photosynthetic efficiency (
 <italic>Fv/Fm</italic>). Melatonin has the potential to protect plants from the adverse effects of drought stress by enhancing the ROS scavenging efficiency. It helps in protection of photosynthetic apparatus and reduction of drought induced oxidative stress
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>
 </sup>. These results demonstrated that foliar application of melatonin improved photosynthetic capacity and reduced the oxidative damage in 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> species under water stress conditions, and supported the hypothesis that exogenous application of melatonin could effectively enhance stress tolerance in plants
