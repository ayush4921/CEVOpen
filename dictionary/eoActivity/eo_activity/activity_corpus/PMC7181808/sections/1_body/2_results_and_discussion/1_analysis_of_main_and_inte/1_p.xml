<p id="Par15">Our study evaluated the responses of 
 <italic>Salvia nemorosa</italic> L. and 
 <italic>Salvia reuterana</italic> Boiss. to foliar melatonin under reduced irrigation; in conditions of water stress (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The results reported significant main and interactive effects (at 5% and 1% probability levels) of species, water stress, melatonin, species × water stress, species × melatonin, water stress × melatonin and species × water stress × melatonin on electrolyte leakage (EL), essential oil content (EOC), essential oil yield (EOY), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), total glutathione (GT), reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione reductase (GR), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) (Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). 
 <italic>Fv/Fm</italic>, MDA, H

 <sub>2</sub>, GSH/GSSG, CAT and POD activity showed significant change in response to all main and interactive effects other than the interactive effect of species × water stress × melatonin (Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Interactive effect of water stress × melatonin was significant on all the above-mentioned traits at 1% probability levels (Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The interactive effect of species × melatonin was regarded non-significant only in terms of MDA accumulation, GR and POD activities (Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). However, interactive effects of species × melatonin and species × water stress on GSH/GSSG ratio and CAT activity showed no significant differences (Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Similar effect of species, melatonin, water stress, and species × water stress significantly triggered different responses in 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> species were recently reported

 <italic>Salvia</italic> cultivars studied in our experiment were also in line with the results obtained in another
