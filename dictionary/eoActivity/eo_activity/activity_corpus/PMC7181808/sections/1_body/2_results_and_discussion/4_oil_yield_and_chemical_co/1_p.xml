<p id="Par18">Mild water stress had a similar impact on both EOC and EOY, with 60% FC having the highest values, and 80% FC, the lowest. Previous research has reported a decrease in essential oil content in different 
 <italic>Lamiaceae</italic> species under water stress
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>
 </sup>, while others have shown an increase in essential oil content in 
 <italic>Lamiaceae</italic> species under drought conditions
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>
 </sup>. As seen here, cultivar-specific responses to water stress may factor into the differences observed by these studies. Likewise, increasing levels of foliar melatonin application had a positive impact on EOC and EOY in both 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> species (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Taken together, the highest essential oil content (1.15%) and essential oil yield (0.58%) were recorded with 200 µM melatonin applied on 
 <italic>Salvia nemorosa</italic> grown under mild water stress (60% FC) conditions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Despite the clear effect of both water stress and melatonin, the impact of water was greatest. This is displayed by the 60% FC treatment with 0 µM melatonin having a greater EOC and EOY than the other irrigation treatments at 200 µM melatonin for 
 <italic>Salvia nemorosa</italic>. The composition of essential oil produced under different water stress regimes and melatonin treatments are reported in Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>. Eighteen compounds, accounting for 81.87%-98.87% of the total essential oil content, were identified in 
 <italic>Salvia nemorosa</italic> (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The main essential oil components of 
 <italic>Salvia nemorosa</italic> were β- caryophyllene (37.53–40.13%), germacrene- B (19.83–21.37%), spathulenol (6.37–8.72%), and cis- β- farnesene (5.75–7.83%) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Evaluation of essential oil yields of 
 <italic>Salvia reuterana</italic> also resulted in fourteen components representing 81.34–98.46% of the total essential oil content. Among the characterized compounds, (E) - β- ocimene (35.76–38.82%), α- gurjnnene (16.23–17.66%), germacrene-D (10.7–13.15%), hexyl acetate (6.55–9.21%), and aromadendrene (3.33–5.65%) were the major constituents (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Those results demonstrated that the highest percentage of major essential oil constituents were observed when both 
 <italic>Salvia nemorosa</italic> and 
 <italic>Salvia reuterana</italic> were exposed to mild water stress (60% FC) compared to those that were under severe water stress (40% FC). The various levels of melatonin affected the constituents of essential oils of both 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> species in different ways. Treatment of 
 <italic>Salvia nemorosa</italic> with 150 µM of melatonin resulted in the accumulation of β- caryophyllene, Germacrene- B, spathulenol and cis- β- farnesene to a significant extend and more than the other treatments (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), while for 
 <italic>Salvia reuterana</italic>, 150 µM of melatonin enhanced the accumulation of hexyl acetate and aromadendrene and 200 µM of melatonin caused an increase in (E) - β- Ocimene, α- gurjnnene and germacrene-D more than other treatments (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Similarly, Sarrou

 </sup> also observed that melatonin treated lemon balm (
 <italic>Melissa officinalis</italic>) reported an increase in several compounds, in particular nerol, a result similar to our study. Although the role of melatonin in the biosynthesis of essential oil in medicinal plants has not been well understood, one of the mechanisms proposed is related to the similarity in plant function and chemical structure between indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and melatonin

 </sup>, which are both derived from chorismate

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>
 </sup>, and given that melatonin has an auxin-like (IAA) activity, it would be expected that melatonin also promotes the synthesis of essential oils. It has been hypothesized that the increased amount of essential oil of 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> species in response to foliar melatonin application can be attributed to the potential enhancement of meristematic cells, site of production of several chemical compounds that are fundamental for oil biosynthesis
