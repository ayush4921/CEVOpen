<p id="Par19">Cluster analysis of the combined treatments (foliar applied melatonin and irrigation regimes) is reported in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, based on similarity. The cluster analysis was conducted in relation to enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant properties and essential oil yield of the two 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> species, which divided the 30 treatment combinations into 3 major clusters. Cluster I includes different foliar melatonin treatments for both 
 <italic>Salvia nemorosa</italic> and 
 <italic>Salvia reuterana</italic> under the normal irrigation regime (D
 <sub>1</sub>). Cluster II contains 
 <italic>Salvia nemorosa</italic> and 
 <italic>Salvia reuterana</italic> and foliar application of melatonin under mild drought stress (D
 <sub>2</sub>). Cluster III shows the foliar treatments of melatonin for 
 <italic>Salvia nemorosa</italic> and 
 <italic>Salvia reuterana</italic> grown under severe water stress (D
 <sub>3</sub>). These results demonstrated that the effect of water irrigation regimes was more prominent in modifying the physiological responses of the two 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> species, followed as second level of importance by the impact of the foliar applied melatonin and lastly as third level of importance the genetic diversity of the two species of 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> utilized in the research (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The cluster analysis suggests that irrigation is the best tool for controlling essential oil production in 
 <italic>Salvia</italic>, but that the effect of melatonin was also great enough to induce similar responses to two 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> cultivars differing in their response to water stress.
