<p id="Par17">When exposed to oxidative stress, plants can activate their oxygen scavenging systems by increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes or by mobilization of their non-enzymatic antioxidants, such as reduced glutathione (GSH)

 </sup>. In this study, both non-enzymatic and enzymatic antioxidants were evaluated. Glutathione Reductase (GR) exists primarily in the chloroplast and reduces glutathione disulfide (GSSG) to glutathione (GSH). GSH participates in enzymatic and non-enzymatic H

 <italic>Brassica napus</italic>. Here, increasing drought stress produced higher cell H

 <sub>2</sub> concentrations, but was mitigated by increasing melatonin concentration (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In response, GT, GR, and GSH were similarly modulated, reaffirming this the role of this system in ameliorating drought stress. A similar effect of melatonin on total glutathione content was observed also by Wang 
 <italic>et al</italic>.

 </sup> on apple leaves when treated with a foliar melatonin application. Additionally, oxidized glutathione (GSSG) reported a significant increase when both 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> species were subjected to water stress, but decreased with increasing melatonin (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The GSH/GSSG ratio is considered as an indirect indicator of oxidative stress and damage. When plants are exposed to oxidative stress GSSG is accumulated and the ratio of GSH to GSSG decreases

 </sup>. In our study, mild and severe water stress decreased the GSH/GSSG ratio in both 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> species, indicative of stress (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). However, the increasing ratio of GSH/GSSG in response to exogenously applied melatonin showed the beneficial effect of melatonin in reducing oxidative stress and improving water stress tolerance, in line with the research reported by Galano 
 <italic>et al</italic>.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>
 </sup> that also showed that foliar application of melatonin in wheat plants exposed to stress conditions elevated total GSH content, as well as significantly enhanced the ratio of GSH/GSSG compared to control plants and stressed plants without melatonin. Similar to glutathione, enzymatic antioxidant activity in plants subjected to increasing water stress regimes was enhanced, with the exception of SOD in 
 <italic>S nemorosa</italic>. SOD, POD and CAT levels indicate that the main protective enzymes in the enzymatic defence system, can effectively scavenge reactive oxygen species

 </sup> suggested the higher activity of SOD in medicinal plants was due to their increased resistant to drought stress, suggesting that 
 <italic>Salvia nemorosa</italic> with higher SOD activity (0.058) could be more water stress tolerant than 
 <italic>Salvia reuterana</italic> (0.052), as reported in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. Additionally, the activity of catalase (CAT) activity increased with higher levels of melatonin application, whereas POD and SOD saw an opposite response in most cases (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Catalase is a member of the haem peroxidase family of enzymes that are distinctly responsible for the dismutation of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> into H
 <sub>2</sub>O and O
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>
 </sup>. Given this, and that POD and SOD have other roles within the redox system, it is understandable how only CAT activity increased similar to that of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>. Interestingly, Munne-Bosch 
 <italic>et al</italic>.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>
 </sup> found that in response to the oxidative burst (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) marking the start of the ripening process in guava, MDA concentration, POD, and SOD activity increased, whereas, GT, GR, GSH, and CAT decreased. These results suggest that CAT operates similarly to GR in response to oxidative stimuli, but are not related with POD and SOD activity, a result seen here in response to the redox-modulator melatonin.
