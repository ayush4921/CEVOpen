<p id="Par20">The treatment of two 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> cultivars with melatonin improved their antioxidant defence system against drought stress. This consequently enabled plants to increase their production of essential oil, especially under mild drought stress conditions. A particular effect of melatonin was observed on CAT activity compared with other antioxidant enzymes, which warrants further research in order to understand their role in increasing essential oil production in 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> plants. Irrigation had the greatest impact on essential oil production in two 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> cultivars, however, melatonin also had a significant added effect.
