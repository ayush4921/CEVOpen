 </sup> using 120 days old plants (from seed germination to full bloom stage). Plant tissue collected from the flowering stems of 
 <italic>Salvia nemorosa</italic> L., and 
 <italic>Salvia reuterana</italic> Boiss., were dried in a stove at 30 °C until constant weight was obtained, then crushed into small fragments by a grinding machine and stored in a freezer at −20 °C until the beginning of the distillation process. The essential oils were extracted by hydro-distillation in a Clevenger-type apparatus over 3 h in 1.5 L of water. Water was then removed from the essential oil using anhydrous sodium sulphate and then weighed. The essential oil content was determined based on the volume extracted per 100 g of leaf dry biomass (% w/v). The essential oil yield was also determined by multiplying the essential oil content by the leaf dry biomass (g plant
 <sup>−1</sup>).
