<p id="Par14">The composition of essential oils of 
 <italic>Salvia nemorosa</italic> L. and 
 <italic>Salvia reuterana</italic> Boiss was detected using a gas chromatograph attached to a mass spectrometer (tandem GC-MS), including a Shimadzu GC-9 gas chromatograph equipped with a DB-5 (dimethylsiloxane, 5% phenyl) fused silica column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 m), with internal diameter of the column 0.25 mm, film thickness of 0.25 µm. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 2 ml/min with a linear velocity of 32 cm/s. The flame ionization detector (FID) temperature was 265 °C and the injector temperature was 250 °C. The percentage of the different compounds was calculated by the area normalization method, without considering response factors. Identification of the components was based on a comparison of their mass spectra (MS) with a computer library or with the authentic compound (standard spectra) and confirmation of compound identities was also obtained using relative retention indices (RI). Moreover, the percentage of each component of the essential oil was calculated by utilizing the peak height as well as the peak area.
