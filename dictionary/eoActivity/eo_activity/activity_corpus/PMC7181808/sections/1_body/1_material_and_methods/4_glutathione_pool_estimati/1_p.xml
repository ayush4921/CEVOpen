 </sup>. The fresh leaf samples were centrifuged at 11500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and the 0.4 mL of the supernatant was then added to 1 mL of 0.5 M potassium phosphate buffered at pH 7.5. Then, 100 µL 2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB, 10 mM), 200 µL bovine serum albumin (BSA, 10 mM), 100 µL nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH, 0.5 mM) were added to the vial and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Finally, the mixture was allowed to cool and the change in absorbance at 412 nm was measured against a blank containing 0.4 mL of water. The results were expressed as nmol per gram fresh weight (nmol

The extract (100 µL) was mixed with 600 µL reaction buffer (100 mM potassium phosphate buffer containing 5 mM EDTA, pH 7.5), 100 µL of diluted yeast glutathione reductase (GR, 20 U/mL), and 100 µL of 10 mM DNTB. The reaction was initiated by adding 100 µL of 2.5 mM nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), and after mixing thoroughly, the rate of absorption change at 412 nm was measured spectrophotometrically. The results were expressed as nmol per gram fresh weight (nmol
