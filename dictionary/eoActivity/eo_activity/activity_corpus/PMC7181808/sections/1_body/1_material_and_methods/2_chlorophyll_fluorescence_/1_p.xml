<p id="Par8">The maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (
 <italic>Fv/Fm</italic>) was measured with a fluorometer (Walz, Effeltrich, Germany) after 30 min of leaf dark adaptation. The 
 <italic>Fv/Fm</italic> ratio was calculated as: 
 <italic>Fv/Fm</italic> = (
 <italic>Fm- F0</italic>)/
 <italic>Fm</italic>, where, Fm and F0 represented the maximum and minimum yields of dark-adapted leaves, respectively. Electrolyte leakage (EL) was measured by using a conductivity meter according to Ozden 
 <italic>et al</italic>.
