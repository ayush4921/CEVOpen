<p id="Par12">Fresh foliar tissue (0.2 g) from 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> seedlings (uppermost leaves) was harvested, weighed, washed with distilled water and then homogenized with a mortar and pestle with 5 ml chilled sodium phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.8). The homogenates were centrifuged at 15,000 g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was stored at 4 °C and used for CAT, POD, SOD and GR assays. CAT activity was measured by the method of Blume and McClure (1980). CAT activity was expressed as μmol of hydrogen peroxide oxidized per minute per milligram of protein. POD activity was determined spectrophotometrically, by measuring the oxidation of o-dianisidine (3, 3- dimethoxybenzidine) at 460 nm as described by Ranieri 
 <italic>et al</italic>.

 </sup> and expressed as units (μmol of dianisidine oxidized per minute) per mg of protein. SOD activity was estimated by recording the decrease in absorbance of superoxide-nitroblue tetrazolium complex by the enzyme (Cavalcanti 
 <italic>et al</italic>.)

 </sup>. A 3 mL of reaction mixture was prepared with 0.1 mL of 13 mM L-methionine, 0.1 mL of 75 µM 
 <italic>p</italic>- nitroblue terazolium chloride (NBT), 0.1 mL of 100 µM EDTA, 0.1 mL riboflavin (2 µM) in a 1.5 mL of 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.8, 50 µL of the enzymatic extract and distilled water. The reaction was started under illumination of fluorescent lamp (30 W) at 25 °C and stopped 5 min later by turning the lamp off. The blue formazane produced by NBT photo-reduction was measured as an increase in absorbance at 560 nm. The control reaction mixture had no enzyme extract (with maximal colour formation). The blank solution had the same complete reaction mixture, but was kept in the dark. One SOD unit was defined as the amount of enzyme required to inhibit 50% of the NBT photo-reduction in comparison with tubes lacking the plant extract and expressed as a unit of enzyme activity per mg of protein. Glutathione reductase (GR) activity was identified by following the rate of NADPH oxidation at 340 nm according to Balabusta 
 <italic>et al</italic>.

 <sub>2</sub> in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), and 100 µL of the enzyme extract in the total volume of 400 µL. GR activity was expressed as µmol of NADPH oxidized during 1 min per 1 mg of proteins (µ mol min
 <sup>−1</sup> mg protein
