<p id="Par7">After deducting pot weight and weight of the dry soil, the amount of water stored in the FC condition was determined and irrigation treatments (80, 60 and 40% FC) were calculated accordingly. Therefore, pots were weighed daily based on each treatment and water was added to maintain the specific FC level in each pot. Two weeks after full flowering stage, 120-day old plants were harvested by cutting stems 5â€‰cm above the soil surface and the measurements were made on freshly mature leaves. All the data were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) and means were then separated using the Least Significant Difference (LSD) using SAS (version 8.2; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) and MSTAT-C software
