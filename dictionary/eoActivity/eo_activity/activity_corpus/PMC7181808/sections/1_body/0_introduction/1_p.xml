<p id="Par2">Plants growing in arid and semi-arid regions often experience conditions of reduced precipitation and erratic rainfall patterns. Water stress reduces chlorophyll content and consequently, photosynthetic performance

 </sup>. Severe water limitations can cause an imbalance between cellular redox components, where antioxidant defences do not counteract the greater production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This induces a series of oxidative damages, leading to impaired growth and development

 </sup>. Additionally, high ROS concentrations within particular organelles can oxidize cellular constituents, such as membrane lipids, indicated by an increase in the lipid peroxidation by-product malondialdehyde (MDA), as well as carbohydrates, proteins, and DNA
