 <italic>Salvia reuterana</italic> is present in the central regions of Iran with arid and semi-arid climate, while 
 <italic>Salvia nemorosa</italic> is more likely to be originated from the northern regions of Iran with higher humidity and rainfall. Despite their importance as medicinal plants, 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> are drought sensitive, and oxidative damages have previously been reported in drought-stressed
