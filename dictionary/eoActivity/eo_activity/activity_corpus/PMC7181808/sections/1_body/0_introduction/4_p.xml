 </sup>. Between the two 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> species reported on here, drought resistance in 
 <italic>Salvia reuterana</italic> is known to be higher than 
 <italic>Salvia nemorosa</italic>. In this contest, improvement in drought resistance in both 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> species has an important practical significance for the agricultural production of medicinal herbs. Currently, there is no report on the potential use of exogenous melatonin in 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> production. Therefore, the present study was conducted to investigate the impact of foliar melatonin on growth, photosynthetic rate, oxidative stress, and essential oil production under drought stress conditions of two 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> species. The results would grant new insights into melatonin function in plants and provide a new tool for medicinal plant cultivation to consistently improve yield and quality.
