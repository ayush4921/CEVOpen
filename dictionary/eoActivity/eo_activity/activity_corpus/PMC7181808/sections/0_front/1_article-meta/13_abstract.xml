 <p id="Par1">This research was conducted to understand the influence of foliar applied melatonin (0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 μM) on two 
  <italic>Salvia</italic> species (
  <italic>Salvia nemorosa</italic> L., and 
  <italic>Salvia reuterana</italic> Boiss) under conditions of water stress. Water stress was applied using a reduced irrigation strategy based on re-watering at 80%, 60% and 40% of the field capacity (FC). Increasing water stress, while significantly enhancing malondialdehyde (MDA), H
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>2</sub>, electrolyte leakage, oxidized glutathione (GSSG), and total glutathione (GT), reduced glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione reductase (GR) activities, which led to a marked reduction in fluorescence (
  <italic>Fv/Fm</italic>). Foliar application of melatonin alleviated the oxidative stress by increasing GT, CAT, POD, SOD and GR activities and reducing GSSG. In particular, melatonin heightened GSH content as well as the ratio of GSH/GSSG when compared to non-sprayed water stressed plants. Melatonin-treated plants had significantly lower SOD and POD activities than control plants under drought stress, while the CAT activity was enhanced with the foliar treatment. Essential oil yield of both 
  <italic>Salvia</italic> species increased with the decrease in irrigation from 80% to 60% FC but diminished with the more severe water deficit (40% FC). Essential oil components of 
  <italic>Salvia nemorosa</italic> were β- caryophyllene, germacrene- B, spathulenol, and cis- β- farnesene, while (E) - β- ocimene, α- gurjnnene, germacrene-D, hexyl acetate and aromadendrene was the major constituents of 
  <italic>Salvia reuterana</italic>. When plants were subjected to water deficit, melatonin treatment increased the concentration and composition of the essential oil. In particular, melatonin treatments improved the primary oil components in both species when compared to non-melatonin treated plants. In conclusion, reduced irrigation regimes as well as melatonin treatments resulted in a significant improvement of essential oil production and composition in both 
  <italic>Salvia</italic> species.
