<p>Most of the studies included in this review were animal and cell-based evaluations, providing only foundational evidence for the efficacy of the aforementioned plants in human studies. Only six clinical studies were considered in this paper and higher levels of evidence are essential to examine the medicinal suggestions of TPM in clinical settings. Although there are several ongoing clinical trials on the effect of TPM formulas on COVID-19, no published data is available. Despite the challenges in decision-making for the clinical assessment of natural products in SARS-CoV-2, high-quality trials have evaluated the effect of such products with valuable outcomes (

The National Health Commission of China has also added some TCM recommendations to the latest guidelines for the management of COVID-19 patients, even in severe cases (

Thus, the trial design and inclusion/exclusion criteria for patients, as well as drug preparation can be defined in a way that is comprehensively approved. Natural compounds may have some advantages in comparison to conventional drugs. For instance, there are concerns about the currently available TNF-α inhibitors because they can suppress the immune system, leading to secondary bacterial/viral infections (

Further studies in healthy individuals that assess the prophylactic activity of these supplements as well as trials in patients with less severe symptoms would pave the way for further clinical evaluations.
