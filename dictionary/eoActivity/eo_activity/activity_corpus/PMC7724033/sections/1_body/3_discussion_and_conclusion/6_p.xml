<p>Some of the included compounds such as quercetin, pyrogallol, and fructan polysaccharides are considered ubiquitous, i.e. they can be found in several foods and spices of the human diet and do not belong to a specific medicinal plant. Despite the abundance of these compounds, their pharmacological activity cannot be denied and further interpretation of the results of studies is of great importance. For example, in an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> study by 
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">Mahmood etÂ al. (1996)</xref> quercetin showed the highest antiviral activity against HIV amongst several evaluated phytochemicals. This does not mean that any quercetin-containing plant can be effective against viral infection. Instead, the effective dose of this compound should be measured in preclinical studies and a dose translation calculation is needed to suggest accurate human doses of quercetin and to observe related pharmacological activity.
