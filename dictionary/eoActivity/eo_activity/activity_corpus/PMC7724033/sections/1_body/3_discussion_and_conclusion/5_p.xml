<p>On the other hand, some phytochemicals have revealed direct antiviral activity

Although the life cycle and target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 may differ from the assessed viruses to some extent, there would be similarities that are worth assessing in terms of the antiviral activity of these compounds against the virus. As has been reported in virtual screenings (
 <xref rid="B163" ref-type="bibr">Zhang etÂ al., 2020a</xref>), some of these compounds have shown significant interactions with SARS-CoV-2 structures, further confirming their antiviral activity. In this regard, molecular docking analyses would help in selecting structures with the highest binding affinity and the ability to inhibit viral enzymes. The virtually selected antiviral phytochemicals can then be evaluated in cell-based and animal studies. Likewise, they can be considered as molecular backbones in the design of new semisynthetic structures and in creating new compounds with higher safety and antiviral efficacy.
