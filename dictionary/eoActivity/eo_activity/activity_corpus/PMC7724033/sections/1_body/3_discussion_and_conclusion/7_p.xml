<p>An important limitation of the studies included in this review is that many of them lacked a positive control group. Some of the reports used dexamethasone as a standard anti-inflammatory agent in antiviral evaluations, however, most of the studies did not consider a standard treatment. This methodological problem makes any judgment regarding the potency of the assessed materials difficult. Some antiviral phytochemicals have significantly lower SI compared with conventional antiviral agents which excludes them from further assessment. Lack of a positive control makes such comparisons difficult since SI reported in other studies do not provide an accurate comparison due to these methodological differences. The same problem exists in the evaluation of the other pharmacological properties of the plants. Thus, future studies should consider the use of a gold standard drug for a better presentation of the potency of test agents.</p>
