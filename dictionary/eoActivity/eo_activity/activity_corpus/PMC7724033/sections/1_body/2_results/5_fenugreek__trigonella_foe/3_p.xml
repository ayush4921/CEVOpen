<p>There are also several studies on the cardioprotective effects of fenugreek (

 </xref>). Dietary fenugreek powder (
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">Mukthamba and Srinivasan, 2015</xref>), trigonelline (a pyridine alkaloid), and digoxigenin-3-O-rutin (a cardiac glycoside) have reversed isoproterenol-induced cardiotoxicity in rats (
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">Panda and Kar, 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">Panda et al., 2013</xref>). Both compounds exerted modulatory effects on the cardiac biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation, including CK-MB, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and lipid peroxidation. Trigonelline showed the highest pharmacological activity at a dose of 40 mg/kg. On the other hand, digoxigenin-3-O-rutin was effective at 2.5-10 mg/kg which was comparable with 5 mg/kg of digoxin as the gold standard drug (
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">Panda and Kar, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, trigonelline could reduce the level of heat shock protein (HSP)-27 and αB-crystallin, two novel biomarkers of oxidative damage, in the myocardium damage, further confirming the cardioprotective activity of fenugreek (

 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, possibly due to their antioxidant activity and prevention of DNA damage (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Feki et al., 2019</xref>). Aside from antioxidant activity (
 <xref rid="B143" ref-type="bibr">Tripathi and Chandra, 2009</xref>), inhibition of pathologic NO production by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and markers of cardiac fibrosis, such as fibronectin and collagen, seem to be the main cardioprotective mechanisms of fenugreek demonstrated in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced cardiac damage (
