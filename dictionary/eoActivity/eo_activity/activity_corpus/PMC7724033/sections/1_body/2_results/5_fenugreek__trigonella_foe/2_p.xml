<p>Fenugreek seed extract has demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory properties in an animal model of pulmonary inflammation, evident from the reduction of leukocytes infiltration to the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung fibrosis. Pro-inflammatory cytokines and endogenous enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants were also restored to near normal levels. Stimulation of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) by fenugreek, an antioxidant cascade, prevents the hemeoxigenase-1 (HO-1) overproduction, subsequently ameliorating pulmonary fibrosis. The effectiveness of the extract with 5-40 mg/kg dose range in most of the investigated parameters were equal or higher than 10 mg/kg of methylprednisolone as the gold standard drug (

Likewise, the antiasthmatic effect of fenugreek seed syrup, designed based on the lung protecting properties of the plant in TPM, was assessed in a clinical trial. Four weeks of treatment with the syrup caused a significant improvement in spirometry parameters in comparison to the baseline values (
