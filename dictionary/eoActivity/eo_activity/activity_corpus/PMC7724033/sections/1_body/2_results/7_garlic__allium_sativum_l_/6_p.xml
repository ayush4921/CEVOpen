<p>Diallyl trisulfide has also exhibited nephroprotective activity in arsenic-induced kidney damage. In addition to the improvement of BUN and creatinine as routine markers of renal function, the compound could modify several markers of inflammation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress (

Furthermore, p-53, an initiator of apoptosis, and its downstream proteins B-cell associated X protein (Bax) and Bcl-2 were regulated by this compound. Poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), a DNA repairing enzyme during apoptosis which is also under regulation of p-53, was decreased as well, revealing the reversal of cisplatin-induced DNA damage (
