<p>Rhubarb anthraquinones have also demonstrated cardioprotective properties. Emodin could increase the secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), a molecule secreted by cardiomyocytes with a multitargeted role in cardioprotection (

Chrysophanol has shown an inhibitory effect on PARylation, the process of PARP attachment to its target proteins, overactivation of which participates in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. In addition, apoptotic markers, as well as mitochondrial damage were reduced by chrysophanol both
