<p>The methanolic and aqueous extracts of clove have shown inhibitory effects on HCV protease enzyme with an IC

 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Hussein et al., 2000</xref>). Eugenol has exhibited antiviral effects against the influenza A virus through direct reduction of viral replication, as well as inhibition of autophagy, a supporting mechanism for viral replication and cell death which results in acute lung damage. It should be mentioned that the potency of eugenol at the concentration of 5 μg/ml was equal or higher than 25 μg/ml of ribavirin as the gold standard antiviral agent, recommending eugenol as a potent antiviral compound (

Furthermore, eugenol could regulate cellular inflammatory cascades such as nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, nitric oxide (NO), the release of pro-inflammatory ILs, and endogenous antioxidant defense mechanisms (
