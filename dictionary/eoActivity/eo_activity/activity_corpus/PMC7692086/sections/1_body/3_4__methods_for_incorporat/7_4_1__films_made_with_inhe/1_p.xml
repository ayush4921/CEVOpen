These types of materials have great potential because, in addition to containing biopolymers such as proteins, fibers and starch, they may also contain bioactive compounds such as phenolic compounds with antioxidant and antimicrobial activities in their composition, which allow the production of bioactive films with functional properties differentiated from conventional materials [
