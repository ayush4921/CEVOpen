Unlike conventional packaging, active packaging (AP) has some characteristics that allow the packaging material to interact positively with food and the environment, extending product shelf life. The active packaging can come in various forms, such as sachets or compresses containing bioactive compounds, coating or adsorption of active compounds on the polymer surface; immobilization of active compounds in polymers by ion or covalent bonds; polymeric films with direct incorporation of bioactive substances or packaging even produced with inherently bioactive polymers [
