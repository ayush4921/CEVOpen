<p>Films produced with saffron flour obtained from the extraction residue of saffron dye showed antioxidant activity due to the presence of curcuminoids in the flour [

According to the authors, the film exhibited antioxidant activity with 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH) and 2,2â€²-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) radical scavenging activities of 52.63% and 54.74%, respectively, due to the phenolic compounds inherent in the gum [
