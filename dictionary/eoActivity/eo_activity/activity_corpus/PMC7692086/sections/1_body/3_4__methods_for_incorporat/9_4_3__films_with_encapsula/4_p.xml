<p>The encapsulation of some bioactive compounds enables their use in packaging applications, which is the case of 2-phenyl ethanol, for example. The encapsulation of 2-phenyl ethanol was essential to reduce losses due to volatilization or degradation during the film production process. Zarandona et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-polymers-12-02518" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] observed this behavior when they studied the release of 2-phenyl ethanol from chitosan films with free 2-phenyl ethanol and chitosan films with Î²-cyclodextrin: 2-phenyl ethanol (encapsulated) during immersion of the films in 95% ethanol for 4 days. The results of releasing the films without the inclusion complex indicated that 2-phenyl ethanol was lost before or during the preparation of the films due to its high volatility, and only 8% of the total bioactive was retained in the film, while more than 90% of the 2-phenyl ethanol was retained in the films with the inclusion complex, confirming the improvement on the retention of the bioactive with its encapsulation [

Different methods have been used for encapsulating bioactive compounds so that they can later be incorporated into a film-forming solution. Thymol nanoemulsions, an antimicrobial essential oil, was produced by mixing gelatin and soy lecithin [

 <xref rid="B29-polymers-12-02518" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The spray drying technique was also used for the microencapsulation of blackberry pulp [

 <xref rid="B127-polymers-12-02518" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>] observed the effect of oregano essential oil microencapsulated by ionic gelation on soy protein concentrate. The internal ionotropic gelation of sodium alginate and pectin was used for the production of hydrogel particles from Immortelle (
