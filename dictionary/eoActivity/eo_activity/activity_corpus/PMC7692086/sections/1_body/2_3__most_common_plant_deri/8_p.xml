<p>A recent study showed the influence of different factors (four parameters of soil physical properties, twelve parameters of soil chemical properties, thirty-year climate records and genetic diversity) on the bioactive compounds of 
 <italic>Glechoma longituba</italic>, a plant widely spread in China that has long been used as a beneficial health ingredient in human diet. In addition to the great variations in the levels of extracts soluble in ethanol, total flavonoids, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, rosmarinic acid, oleanolic acid and ursolic acid proven among different populations of 
 <italic>Glechoma longituba</italic>, it was observed that the chemical property of the soil and the climatic condition exerted significant influences on the concentrations of bioactive compounds present in the plant [
