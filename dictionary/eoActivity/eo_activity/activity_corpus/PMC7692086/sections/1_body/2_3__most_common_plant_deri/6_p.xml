<p>There is still a wide range of plant-derived bioactive compounds that have not been characterized in terms of physical–chemical properties, toxicity and edibility. This fact implies that extensive investigations, including tests that assess the in vitro and in vivo (food product) efficiency of plant-derived bioactive compounds, are still needed for improving food safety. The choice of specific plant-derived bioactive compounds for application depends on their bioactive properties (antioxidant, antimicrobial), availability and cost–benefit ratio [
