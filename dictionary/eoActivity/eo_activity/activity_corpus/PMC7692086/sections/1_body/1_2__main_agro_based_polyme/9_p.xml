<p>Despite the promising characteristics of edibility, biocompatibility and biodegradability presented by polymer from agricultural sources, it is still evident that there are limitations to be overcome for the commercial success of these films (mainly low elongation, low resistance to gases and liquids), especially when compared to synthetic plastics [

In general, it is noted that films produced from polysaccharides tend to have a good barrier against gases, but have low resistance to water vapor and low mechanical resistance, while the films produced from proteins also have low resistance to water vapor, but good mechanical resistance [
