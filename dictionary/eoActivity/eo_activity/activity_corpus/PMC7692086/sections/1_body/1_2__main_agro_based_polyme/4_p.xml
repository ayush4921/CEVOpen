<p>Alginate and pectin are anionic polysaccharides. Pectin is derived from the plant cell wall and it is obtained commercially by aqueous extraction of pectic material from some fruits, being found in higher amounts in citrus fruits and apples [
 <xref rid="B49-polymers-12-02518" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. It consists mainly of the methoxy esterified α, d-1, 4-galacturonic acid units [
 <xref rid="B50-polymers-12-02518" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Alginate is composed of β-
 <sc>d</sc>-manuronic acid and α-
 <sc>l</sc>-guluronic acid, joined linearly by α-1,4 glycosidic bonds, obtained from cell walls of brown algae [

Both biopolymers are widely applied in the food industry for being able to form gels with the presence of divalent cations, such as calcium ions. Moreover, they are able to create biodegradable edible films with measurable characteristics [
 <xref rid="B52-polymers-12-02518" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The combination of both polysaccharides generated continuous, homogenous and transparent films [
 <xref rid="B53-polymers-12-02518" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The addition of alginate into pectin-based formulations improved the strength of zinc ions crosslinking network [

 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranosamine)), is a biodegradable cationic polymer derived from chitin, a polysaccharide of animal origin. Chitosan shows antimicrobial properties [
 <xref rid="B55-polymers-12-02518" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] and the ability to form films [
 <xref rid="B56-polymers-12-02518" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. According to Vargas et al. [
 <xref rid="B56-polymers-12-02518" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], due to its high to water vapor permeability, its barrier properties can be improved by its combination with other hydrocolloids. Chitosan is an ideal biopolymer for the development of antimicrobial films due to its non-toxicity [
 <xref rid="B57-polymers-12-02518" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], biocompatibility [
 <xref rid="B58-polymers-12-02518" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], biodegradability and intrinsic antimicrobial action.
