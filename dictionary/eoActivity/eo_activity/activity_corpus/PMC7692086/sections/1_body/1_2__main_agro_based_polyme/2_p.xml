<p>Some characteristics and properties of these biopolymers of agricultural origin have been reported. The most abundant organic compound in nature is cellulose, its derivatives with the methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and carboxymethylcellulose are widely used as raw materials that form edible films, as they are naturally odorless and tasteless [
