<p>So, it is clear that the solubility of the encapsulating agent in the polymeric matrix and in the food simulants significantly influence the release rate of the bioactive compound from the film to the surrounding environment. This resource has great potential for controlling its release. In addition to the type of encapsulating agent used, the technique used for the incorporation of the encapsulated bioactive compounds into the film-forming solution also seems to influence its release rate.</p>
