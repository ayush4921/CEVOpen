<p>Encapsulating some types of bioactive compounds has become essential to improve their compatibility with the film-forming polymer, which is the case of essential oils, for example. Their encapsulation improved their interaction with polymers of agricultural origin, which in their majority have hydrophilic characteristics. The addition of microencapsulated oregano essential oil also improved the mechanical properties and reduced the water vapor permeability of films. Although the microparticles are large (250 ± 6 μm), the good interaction between soy protein concentrate, a material used for forming the film, and the alginate used as a wall material in the microencapsulation of the oil resulted in a more continuous film matrix with few cavities, which led to improvements to them [

The incorporation of gelatin microparticles, containing papaya skin as a filling material, into films also made from gelatin allowed a good interaction between these materials, resulting in a more continuous film matrix and an increase in tensile strength and Young’s modulus [
