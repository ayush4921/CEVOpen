<p>Li et al. [
 <xref rid="B115-polymers-12-02518" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>] observed that the incorporation of thymol nanoemulsions (co-emulsified by blend of gelatin and soy lecithin) weakened the hydrogen bonds of the gelatin molecules and decreased the cohesiveness of the biopolymer network, causing an increase in the water vapor permeability and elongation at break of gelatin film and a decrease in the moisture content and tensile strength. Nevertheless, due to the fact that the particles are uniform and nano-scale, smooth and continuous surfaces were observed for gelatin films containing thymol nanoemulsions [

On the other hand, the incorporation of α-tocopherol nanocapsules into carboxymethyl cellulose films led to a decrease in water vapor permeability, tensile strength and Young’s modulus. The incorporation of nanocapsules caused porosity and changes in the film matrix structure [
