<p>Films incorporated with mango, acerola (
 <italic>Malpighia glabra</italic> L.) or seriguela (
 <italic>Spendias purpurea</italic>) pulps caused an antioxidant effect on dendê oil during 40 days of storage and can be applied to control product oxidation. A reduction of 50%, 49% and 56% in the total phenolic compounds of the films incorporated with mango, acerola and seriguela pulps was observed during storage of dendê oil. This suggests the migration of these compounds from the films to the dendê oil during storage [
