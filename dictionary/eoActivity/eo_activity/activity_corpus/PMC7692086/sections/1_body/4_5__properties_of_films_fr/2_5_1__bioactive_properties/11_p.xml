<p>Kevij et al. [
 <xref rid="B75-polymers-12-02518" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] came across a different behavior; in their study, the release of curcumin from whey protein isolate films was faster and higher with the fatty food simulant (95% ethanol, fatty simulant medium) than with the semi-fatty food simulant (50% ethanol, semi-food simulant medium). This behavior is explained by the lipophilic nature and better solubility of curcumin in 95% ethanol [
