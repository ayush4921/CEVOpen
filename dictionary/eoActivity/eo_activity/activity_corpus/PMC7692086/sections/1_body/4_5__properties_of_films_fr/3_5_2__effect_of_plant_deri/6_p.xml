<p>Plasticizers are used in films to improve both their physical and mechanical properties, joining possible cracks in the biopolymer matrix. When added to the film-forming solution, they modify the molecular organization of the network by increasing the free volume between the molecules. This action usually causes a reduction in intermolecular interactions between the adjacent chains of the biopolymer, increasing the mobility of these chains (
