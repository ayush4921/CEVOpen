<p>The incorporation of blueberry extract into films containing isolated soy protein also transferred antioxidant capacity to the film, delaying the oxidation and hydrolysis of the pork fat packed with it during storage (36 °C, 40% relative humidity, for 5 weeks) [

 <xref rid="B74-polymers-12-02518" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] used films containing guabiroba pulp to store extra virgin olive oil for a period of 15 days. Although the guabiroba pulp is a rich source of bioactive antioxidant compounds, adding it to the films did not show any additional effect on the oxidative stability of this oil. Wu et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-polymers-12-02518" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], on the other hand, observed a significant decrease in the value of peroxides for soy oil packed with pomelo peel flours and tea polyphenol film stored in an oven at 50 °C for 30 days, showing that the bioactive compounds present in the film were able to delay oil oxidation during storage.
