<p>The curcumin released from the composite films into different food simulants is favored by lipophilic substances and can be controlled by reducing the polarity of the starch nanovehicle by acetylation [

Apparently, the highest level of lecithin (1%) decreased the gelatin networkâ€™s cohesiveness, which resulted in an increase in the film porosity, favoring the release of thymol [

 <xref rid="B3-polymers-12-02518" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] observed that the amounts of essential oils from medicinal plants released from sodium alginate films increased when increasing the time of contact with water, reaching the maximum oil release rate at the hundredth minute, when the complete solubilization of the films occurred. The solubility of sodium alginate, a material used for the formation of films in water, seems to have contributed to this release. It is also possible that the volatility of oils also facilitated their release [
