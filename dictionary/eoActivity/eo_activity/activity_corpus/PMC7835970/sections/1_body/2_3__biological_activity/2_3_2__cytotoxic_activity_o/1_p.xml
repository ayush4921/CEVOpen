<p>Nectrianolins A–C 
 <bold>11</bold>, 
 <bold>12</bold>, and 
 <bold>13</bold> were evaluated for their in vitro cytotoxicity against HL60 (human leukemia 60) and HeLa cell lines by the MTT method using a published protocol. Compounds 
 <bold>11</bold>, 
 <bold>12</bold>, and 
 <bold>13</bold> exhibited cytotoxic activity against the HL60 cell line with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 1.7 µM, 1.5 µM and 10.1 µM, respectively. Additionally, compounds 
 <bold>11</bold>, 
 <bold>12</bold>, and 
 <bold>13</bold> exhibited cytotoxicity against the HeLa cell line with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 34.7 µM, 16.6 µM and 52.1 µM, respectively [
