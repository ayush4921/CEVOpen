<p>Compounds 
 <bold>371</bold>–
 <bold>373</bold> were assayed for their antimicrobial activities against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumonia</italic> and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Compounds 
 <bold>371</bold>–
 <bold>372</bold> exhibited significant inhibitory activities against 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> with MIC values of 15 µg/mL and 18 µg/mL, respectively. Compound 
 <bold>373</bold> showed moderate inhibitory activities against 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (MIC 35 µg/mL) and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MIC 39 µg/mL). Ampicillin (MIC values: 8 µg/mL, 3.5 µg/mL, 10 µg/mL, 10 µg/mL and 2.5 µg/mL against the 5 bacteria mentioned above) and kanamycin (MIC values: 4 µg/mL, 1.0 µg/mL, 8 µg/mL, 9 µg/mL and 4 µg/mL against the 5 bacteria mentioned above) served as the positive control. In addition, morphological observation showed the rod-shaped cells of 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> growing into long filaments, which reached 1.5- to 2-fold of the length of the original cells after treatment with compounds 
 <bold>371</bold>–
 <bold>372</bold>. The coccoid cells of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> exhibited a similar response and swelled to a 2-fold volume after treatment with compounds 
 <bold>371</bold>–
 <bold>372</bold> [
