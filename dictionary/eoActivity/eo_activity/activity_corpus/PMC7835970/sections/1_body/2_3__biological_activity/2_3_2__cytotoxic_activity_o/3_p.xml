<p>The cytotoxic activity of the isolated compounds 
 <bold>78</bold>–
 <bold>79</bold> and 
 <bold>113</bold>–
 <bold>114</bold> were tested against Hela cells. Compound 
 <bold>79</bold> showed weak cytotoxic activities against Hela cells with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 43.7 ± 0.43 µM. Compound 
 <bold>78</bold> did not show significant cytotoxic activity. As the oxoindoloditerepene epimers, the 3α-epimer 
 <bold>79</bold> was clearly more cytotoxic than the 3β-epimer 
 <bold>78</bold>, suggesting that their cytotoxic activity depended on their stereochemistry. The acetoxy derivatives 
 <bold>113</bold> and 
 <bold>114</bold> showed weak cytotoxic activities against Hela cells with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 83.8 ± 5.2 µM and 53.5 ± 2.1 µM respectively [
