<p>α-Glucosidase inhibitors are helpful to prevent deterioration of type 2 diabetes and for the treatment of the disease in the early stage, so the α-glucosidase inhibitory effects of the isolated compounds were evaluated. As a result, compounds 
 <bold>247</bold>, 
 <bold>248</bold> exhibited potent α-glucosidase inhibitory activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 25.8 µM, 54.6 µM, respectively, which were much better than acarbose (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 703.8 µM) as a positive control. Compounds 
 <bold>7</bold> and 
 <bold>249</bold> showed moderate inhibitory activity against α-glucosidase with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 188.7 µM and 178.5 µM, respectively. The results indicated that the configureuration at C-5 in compounds 
 <bold>6</bold> and 
 <bold>7</bold> might affect α-glucosidase inhibitory activity. Moreover, the methoxy group at C-15 in the lasiodiplodin derivatives decreased the activity (
 <bold>248</bold> vs. 
 <bold>H</bold> (

 <bold>247</bold>, 
 <bold>I</bold> (

 <bold>J</bold> (

 <bold>K</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00959-f013">Figure 13</xref>), compounds 
 <bold>247</bold> and 
 <bold>I</bold> showed potent α-glucosidase inhibitory effects, whereas 
 <bold>J</bold> and 
 <bold>K</bold> were inactive, which attested that the position of the hydroxyl group had a significant impact on the activity [
