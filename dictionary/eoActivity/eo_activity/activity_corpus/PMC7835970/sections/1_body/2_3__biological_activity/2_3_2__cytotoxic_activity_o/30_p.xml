<p>Compounds 
 <bold>396</bold>–
 <bold>397</bold> were evaluated for their cytotoxic activity against four human tumor cell lines (SF-268, MCF-7, HepG-2 and A549) by the SRB (Sulforhodamine B) method. As a result, compounds 
 <bold>396</bold>, 
 <bold>397</bold> showed weak inhibitory activities against the four tumor cell lines with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 30 to 100 µM (IC
 <sub>50</sub> values against SF-268, MCF-7, HepG-2 and A549 
 <bold>396</bold>: 41.68 ± 0.88 µM, 37.68 ± 0.3 µM, 48.33 ± 0.1 µM and 53.36 ± 0.91 µM, 
 <bold>397</bold>: 69.46 ± 7.08 µM, 97.71 ± 0.72 µM, 79.43 ± 0.63 µM and 0 ≥ 100 µM). Cisplatin was used as a positive control with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 3.39 ± 0.29 µM, 3.19 ± 0.12 µM, 2.42 ± 0.14 µM and 1.56 ± 0.08 µM against the four human tumor cell lines [
