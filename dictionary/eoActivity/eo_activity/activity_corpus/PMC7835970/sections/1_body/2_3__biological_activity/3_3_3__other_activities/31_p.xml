<p>Human carboxylesterases (hCE 1 and hCE 2) are the important enzymes that hydrolyze chemicals with functional groups, such as a carboxylic acid ester and amide, and they are known to play vital roles in drug metabolism and insecticide detoxication. The isolated compounds 
 <bold>379</bold>–
 <bold>385</bold> were assayed for their inhibitory activities against hCE 2. Loperamide was used as a positive control with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 1.31 ± 0.09 µM. Compounds 
 <bold>379</bold>, and 
 <bold>383</bold>–
 <bold>385</bold> displayed significant inhibitory activities against hCE 2 with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 10.43 ± 0.51, 6.69 ± 0.85, 12.36 ± 1.27, 18.25 ± 1.78 µM, respectively [
