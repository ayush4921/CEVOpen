<p>Compounds 
 <bold>222</bold>–
 <bold>223</bold> were evaluated for in vitro inhibition of cell proliferation by the MTT method using a panel of four human cancer cell lines: NCI-H460 (non-small cell lung cancer), SF-268 (CNS glioma), MCF-7 (breast cancer), and PC-3 (prostate adenocarcinoma) cells. Compounds 
 <bold>222</bold> and 
 <bold>223</bold> showed moderate cytotoxicity against four human cancer cell lines with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 18.63 ± 1.82, 20.23 ± 2.15, 23.53 ± 2.33 and 20.48 ± 2.04 µM, and 16.47 ± 1.63, 17.57 ± 2.12 20.79 ± 2.39 and 19.43 ± 2.02 µM, respectively, while compound 
 <bold>D</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00959-f013">Figure 13</xref>) was found to be inactive (&gt;50 µM), which suggested -NH
 <sub>2</sub> group might play a very important role for their cytotoxicity. Doxorubicin (Adriamycin) was used as positive control in this assay (IC
 <sub>50</sub> values against the 4 human cancer cell lines: 0.43 ± 0.12 µM, 0.61 ± 0.09 µM, 0.41 ± 0.11 µM and 0.25 ± 0.08 µM respectively) [
