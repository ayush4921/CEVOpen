<p>The in vitro cytotoxicity assay was performed according to the MTS method in 96-well microplates. Five human tumor cell lines were used: human myeloid leukemia HL-60, human hepatocellular carcinoma SMMC-7721, lung cancer A-549, breast cancer MCF-7, and human colon cancer SW480, which were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). Cisplatin was used as the positive control for the cancer cell lines (IC
