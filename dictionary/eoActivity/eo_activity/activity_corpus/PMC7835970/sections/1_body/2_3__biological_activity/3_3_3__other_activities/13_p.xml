<p>A colorimetric α-glucosidase (Sigma-Aldrich Co. CAS number: 9001-42-7, E.C 3.2.1.20) assay of compounds 
 <bold>176</bold>–
 <bold>180</bold> was performed. 1-deoxynojirimycin (St. Louis, MO, USA) was used as a positive control. In addition, The DPPH radical scavenging assay of these compounds was also conducted with 96-well plates using a revised method. The positive control was used by Vitamin C. Compounds 
 <bold>176</bold>–
 <bold>178</bold> showed significant α-glucosidase inhibitory activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 35.8 μM, 53.3 μM and 60.2 μM, respectively, compared to 62.8 μM for the positive control (1-deoxynojirimycin). Moreover, compound 
 <bold>179</bold> exhibited radical scavenging activity against DPPH with EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 68.1 μM, the EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of positive control ascorbic acid was 22.3 μM [
