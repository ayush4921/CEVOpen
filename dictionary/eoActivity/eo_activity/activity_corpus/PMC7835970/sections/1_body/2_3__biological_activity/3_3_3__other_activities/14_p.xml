<p>The tested compounds 
 <bold>200</bold>, 
 <bold>276</bold>, 
 <bold>344</bold>–
 <bold>346</bold> were investigated for their capacity to inhibit biofilm formation in the reference strains of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. Aacetylquestinol 
 <bold>276</bold>, 
 <bold>345</bold> and 
 <bold>200</bold> were found to cause a significant reduction inbiofilm production by 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> ATCC 25922 with the percentage of biofilm formation: 50.6 ± 17.6%, 23.7 ± 24.8% and 57.6 ± 8.1%, respectively. On the other hand, emodin 
 <bold>344</bold> and 
 <bold>345</bold> showed inhibition of biofilm production in 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 25923 (21.1 ± 11.5% and 21.8 ± 18.9%). Interestingly, 
 <bold>345</bold>, which is the most effective in inhibiting biofilm formation in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> ATCC 25922, also caused nearly 80% reduction of the biofilm production in 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 25923 [
