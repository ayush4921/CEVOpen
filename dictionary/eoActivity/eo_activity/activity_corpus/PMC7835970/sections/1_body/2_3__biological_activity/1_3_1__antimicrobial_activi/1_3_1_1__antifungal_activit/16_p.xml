<p>The new compound, penochalasin K 
 <bold>343</bold> was tested for its antifungal activity against four phytopathogenic fungi including 
 <italic>C. musae</italic>, 
 <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic>, 
 <italic>P. italicm</italic>, and 
 <italic>R. solani</italic>. Compound 
 <bold>343</bold> displayed excellent selective activities against the two phytopathogenic fungi 
 <italic>Colletotrichum gloeosporioides</italic> (Penz) Sacc. (
 <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic>), and 
 <italic>Rhizoctonia solani</italic> Kühn 
 <italic>(R. solani</italic>), with MIC values of 6.13 µM and 12.26 µM, respectively. Moreover, the activity towards 
 <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic> and 
 <italic>R. solani</italic> were about ten-fold and two-fold better than those of the positive control carbendazim, respectively. Whereas only moderate or weak inhibitory activities were exhibited by compound 
 <bold>343</bold> towards 
 <italic>Colletotrichum musae</italic> (Berk. and M. A. Curtis) Arx. (
 <italic>C. musae</italic>) and 
 <italic>Penicillium italicum</italic> Wehme (
 <italic>P. italicm</italic>). Carbendazim and the solvent were adopted as positive and negative control, respectively. The MIC values of Carbendazim against 
 <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic>, 
 <italic>R. solani</italic>, 
 <italic>C. musae and P. italicm</italic> were 65.38 µM, 32.69 µM, 32.69 µM and 16.34 µM [
