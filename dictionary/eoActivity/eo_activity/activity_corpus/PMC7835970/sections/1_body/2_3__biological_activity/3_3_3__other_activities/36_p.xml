<p>Compound 
 <bold>421</bold> was tested for osteoclastic differentiation activity using murine macrophage derived RAW264.7 cells. 
 <bold>421</bold> significantly increased the number of mature osteoclasts at the comparable levels to the positive control of kenpaullone, compared to the negative control (DMSO), suggesting that 
 <bold>421</bold> activated a signaling pathway in osteoclastic differentiation [
