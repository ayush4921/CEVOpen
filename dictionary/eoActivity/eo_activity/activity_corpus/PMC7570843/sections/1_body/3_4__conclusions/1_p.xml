<p>The results demonstrated that the vacuum assisted solvent free microwave extraction method is beneficial for extraction of essential oil from sweet lime peel. Microwave power and extraction time had a significant positive effect on essential oil yield. Whereas, they have shown negative effect on the antimicrobial property of essential oils. Microwave power was shown to exert more effect on both essential oil yield and antimicrobial property compared to extraction time. The optimized values for microwave power and extraction time were 797.844 W and 30 min respectively. The predicted experiment essential oil yield and antimicrobial property were 0.757% and 16.50 mm. In addition, ultrasound pretreatment was found to have a positive impact on essential oil yield. Consequently, the combined effect of ultrasound and microwave extraction may lead to greater essential oil yield. The increase in yield due to ultrasound pretreatment was 37.66%. The extracted essential oil may be useful as an ingredient of food and pharmaceutical industries. The possible future work is to utilize essential oil as a natural antimicrobial agent for application to food or packaging materials.</p>
