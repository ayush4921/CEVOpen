<p>The essential oils obtained under optimized condition were analyzed by gas chromatography (7890A GC System coupled with 240 Iron trap MS, Agilent Technologies Palo Alto, CA, USA). In order to perform the analysis, capillary column (Agilent 19091J-413 HP5; 30 m × 320 µm × 0.25 µm; Agilent Technologies Palo Alto, CA, USA) was used with a 5% phenyl methyl siloxane stationary phase. GC-MS analysis conditions were as follows: carrier gas: Helium (He), flow rate: 1 mL/min; mode of injection: splitless mode; injection volume: 2 µL; inlet temperature: 250 °C; oven temperature program, from 35 °C to 150 °C with 3 °C/min, holding at 150 °C for 10 min, and then to 250 °C with 10 °C/min; MS transfer line temperature, 250 °C; MS quadrupole temperature, 150 °C; ionization temperature, 230 °C; ionization mode, electronic impact at 70 eV. The solvent delay was 4 min [

Identification of compounds was done by comparison with the available National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) V2.0 library in the MS system and quantification was done by calculating the percentage area of the obtained peaks in the chromatogram graph.
