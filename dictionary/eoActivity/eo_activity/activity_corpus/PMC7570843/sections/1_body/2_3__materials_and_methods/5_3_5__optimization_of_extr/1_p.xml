<p>In order to investigate the performance of the vacuum assisted solvent free microwave extraction (VASFME) process, an optimization of the operating condition was achieved. The operational parameters viz. microwave power (P) and processing time (t) were chosen for study. Optimization was done by numerical method with the software Design Expert 10 (Version 5.1; Stat-Ease, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) and was carried out for obtaining maximum yield and antimicrobial activity of essential oils extracted from sweet lime peel where the yield and antimicrobial activity of essential oils were maximized and power and time were maintained in range.</p>
