<p>The specific gravities and refractive indices of sweet lime peel essential oil extracted by VASFME under optimum conditions were 0.864 ± 0.002 and 1.463 ± 0.001, respectively. These physical properties are comparable with findings reported by Chenni, El Abed [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-04072" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] for sweet basil essential oil obtained by solvent free microwave extraction process. The composition of essential oil from sweet lime peel obtained at the optimum condition was analyzed by GC-MS. A total of 49 compounds were identified by mass spectrometry. Out of that the seven major compounds of sweet lime peel essential oil are shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04072-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. The compound d-limonene showed a highest concentration (43.47%), followed by bergamol (7.26%), β-pinene (6.84%), linalool (5.60%), α-pinene (4.49%), 1,8 cineole (4.05), α-terpineol (3.16) and the remaining compounds are in very minor quantity. The composition of essential oil compounds are in line with study reported by Megha and Mumtaj [

The higher microwave extraction power used in this study might affect the yield of d-limonene. The compounds found in sweet lime peel oil are also in agreement with previous reported composition [
