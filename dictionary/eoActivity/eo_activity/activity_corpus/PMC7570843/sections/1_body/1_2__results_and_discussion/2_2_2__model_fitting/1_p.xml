<p>The coefficient of regression of the intercept and linear terms of the model were calculated using the least square technique. Regression analysis and ANOVA were used for fitting the model and for examining the statistical significance of terms. The results of ANOVA are given in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04072-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The correlation coefficients (R
 <sup>2</sup>) for the essential oil yield and antimicrobial property were 0.9498 and 0.8903, respectively. Based on t-statistics, the regression coefficient significant at 95% probability levels was selected for developing the model below (Equations (1) and (2)). These equations were developed to show the relationship between independent variables (microwave power and extraction time) on dependent variable (yield and antimicrobial activity of essential oils) [

 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05), and the model F values were 94.64 and 40.59. There is only a 0.01% chance that a model F value could occur due to noise. The coefficient of variation (C.V.) was 1.99% and 17.76%, suggesting that the model was reliable and reproducible. The results thus indicated that the model could work well for the prediction of essential oil yield and antimicrobial property from sweet lime peels.
