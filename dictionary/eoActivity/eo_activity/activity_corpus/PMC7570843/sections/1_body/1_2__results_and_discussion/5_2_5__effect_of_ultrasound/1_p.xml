<p>Ultrasound pre-treatment had a significant impact on the yield of essential oils from sweet lime peel. The yield varied from 0.84 to 1.06% with ultrasound pre-treatment followed by vacuum assisted solvent free microwave extraction (VASFME) and was significantly higher than that of the only vacuum assisted solvent free microwave extraction at (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05). This may be due to breakdown of plant matrix and the release of intracellular components due to cavitation phenomenon that can cause the high shear force in samples due to ultrasound pre-treatment process [

 <xref rid="molecules-25-04072-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> shows variation of essential oil yield with respect to treatment time. The achieved yields were higher in ultrasound traded VASFMW than that of VASFMW. However, the increase in yield was 7.69%, 16.67%, 37.66% and 23.38% for the peels exposed to ultrasound for 30, 60, 90 and 120 min, respectively. Ultrasound pre-treatment before extraction is capable of enhancing the extraction efficiency and shortening the processing time [

 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05) time dependent. The yield increased with extended ultrasonic times but slowly decreased from 90 to 120 min due to the squeezing out of essential oil from the solvent media as a result of the prolonged ultrasound treatment. The efficient extraction period for achieving the maximum yield was 90 min which was 37.66 % more compared to VASFME. This difference can be attributed to the fact that extraction requires two stages. The first stage involves the penetration of the solvent into the cellular structure followed by the dissolution of soluble constituents in the solvent. The second stage involves the external diffusion of soluble constituents through the porous structure of the residual solids and its transfer from the solution in contact with the particles to the bulk of the solution [
