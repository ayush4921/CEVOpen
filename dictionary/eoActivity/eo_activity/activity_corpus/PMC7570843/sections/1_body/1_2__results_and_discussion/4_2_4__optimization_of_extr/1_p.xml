<p>The numerical optimization technique was used for optimization of extraction process based on the desirability approach. This technique was carried out in order to obtain the maximum essential oil yield and antimicrobial property and thus helped to determine the optimum condition for the extraction of essential oil from sweet lime peel. For optimization, microwave power and extraction time was kept in range and maximized the essential oil yield and antimicrobial property. The optimized microwave power value for the extraction of essential oil was found to be 797.844 W for 30 min. The predicted experiment values for the essential oil yield and antimicrobial property were 0.757% and 16.50 mm, respectively, and the actual experiment values were 0.792 ± 0.03% and 18.25 ± 1.45 mm, respectively.</p>
