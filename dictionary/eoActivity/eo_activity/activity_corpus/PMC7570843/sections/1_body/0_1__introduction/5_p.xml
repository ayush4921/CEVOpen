<p>Microwave extraction is well known for selective and volumetric heating of the target, and it uses less solvent or no solvent, with less extraction time and a higher product quality. In the microwave extraction process, microwave heating and distillation are combined as materials (e.g., plant materials) are subjected to extraction without the use of a solvent. The glands and oleiferous receptacles of plant materials burst due to heating of in situ water which helps to free the essential oil along with production of water vapor. The water vapor and essential oil condense and are collected in the receiving flask. The water and essential oil layer can be easily separated and collected without the addition of any solvents [
