<p>In microorganisms such as 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, the ligands are occupying the same binding pocket of 4-diphosphodicytidyl-2-C-methylerythritol synthase and ornithine delta-aminotransferase, respectively. Moreover, the chance of 
 <italic>Ageratum conyzoides</italic> to be antibacterial and antimalarial agents is opened due to the relatively lower binding energies as well as its stable conformations during interaction with the corresponding proteins (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).
