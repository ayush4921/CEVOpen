 <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> illustrates the name, family, utilized parts, and the traditional uses of plants that were employed in this experiment. Plant identification was carried out by Prof. Dr. Ibrahim Mashaly from Botany Department, Faculty of Science, Mansoura University, Egypt. Plant materials were dried and ground into min pieces. Afterwards, they were extracted thrice at ambient temperature using 70% methanol (48 hr/time). Crude extracts were obtained by evaporating the filtrates under vacuum in a rotary evaporator. The obtained extracts were mixed with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 100 mg/ml and preserved at −30°C.
