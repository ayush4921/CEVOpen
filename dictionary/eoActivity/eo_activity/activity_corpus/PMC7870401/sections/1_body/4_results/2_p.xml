 <xref rid="tbl_003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> illustrates, according to 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> screening, that the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of plant extracts showed high anti-
 <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> activities. All examined plant extracts showed lower IC
 <sub>50</sub> values than sulfadiazine (IC
 <sub>50</sub>=99.4 µg/ml). The methanol extracts of 
 <italic>C. colocynthis</italic> and 
 <italic>L. nobilis</italic> and the oil extracts of lemon grass and marjoram had high anti-
 <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> activities (IC
 <sub>50</sub>=22.86 µg/ml, 31.35 µg/ml, 4.6 µg/ml, and 26.24 µg/ml, respectively). However, their selectivity index values were relatively low, as the selectivity index (SI) values for 
 <italic>T. gondii</italic> were 1.21, 5.5, 6.25, and 5.67, respectively. Interestingly, the methanol extract from 
 <italic>M. chamomilla</italic> and oil extract from citronella had the lowest IC
 <sub>50</sub> values (3.56 µg/ml and 2.54 µg/ml, respectively) and the highest SI values (130.33 and 15.02, respectively) for 
 <italic>T. gondii</italic>.
