<p>To investigate the anti-
 <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> effects of herbal extracts, we examined the fluorescence intensity of RH-GFP. 
 <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref> and
 <xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table"> 2</xref> show the activities of the aforementioned plant extracts against 
 <italic>T. gondii</italic> at concentrations of 50 and 10 µg/ml. The methanol extracts obtained from 
 <italic>M. chamomilla</italic> (
 <italic>German chamomile</italic>), 
 <italic>C. colocynthis, and L. nobilis</italic> had high 
 <italic>anti-Toxoplasma</italic> activities compared with 1 mg/ml sulfadiazine (67.93%). They inhibited RH-GFP growth at 50 µg/ml showing 83.36 ± 7.69, 97.07 ± 8.7, and 7478 ± 12.01% inhibition, respectively (
 <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, among the oil extracts at 50 µg/ml, lemon grass, citronella, and marjoram showed high percentage inhibition of 93.20 ± 8.16, 87.69 ± 3.33, and 63.36 ± 6.66, respectively (
 <xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Figures 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">2 </xref> show the anti-
 <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> activities of sulfadiazine (1 mg/ml), 
 <italic>M. chamomilla</italic> (50 µg/ml), 
 <italic>C. colocynthis</italic> (10 µg/ml), 
 <italic>L. nobilis</italic> (50 µg/ml), lemon grass oil (10 µg/ml), citronella oil (10 µg/ml), and marjoram oil (50 µg/ml).
