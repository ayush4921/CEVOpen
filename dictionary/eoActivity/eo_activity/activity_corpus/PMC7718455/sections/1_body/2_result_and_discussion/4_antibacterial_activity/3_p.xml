 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> which indicate that the minimum zone of inhibition of the bacterium (1.7 cm) was observed at 10 ppm concentration of silver nanoparticles while this zone was found maximum (2.45 cm) at 30 ppm concentration of AgNPs. The zone of inhibition caused by 20 ppm concentration of nanoparticles ranges in between. Thus the maximum ZOI of 2.45 cm was recorded at 30 ppm concentration (
