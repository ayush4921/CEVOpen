<p id="p0070">Samples were investigated by Nova Nano FE-SEM 450 (FEI) scanning electron microscope to obtain topological, morphological and compositional information. Lens mounted DBS and LVD offer best selection of information and image optimization. Beam landing energy cam go down from 30 KeV to 50ev and resolution of 1.4 nm at 1 kV (TLD-SE) and 1 nm at 15 kV (TLD-SE). The entire sample was coated with gold before SEM analysis.</p>
