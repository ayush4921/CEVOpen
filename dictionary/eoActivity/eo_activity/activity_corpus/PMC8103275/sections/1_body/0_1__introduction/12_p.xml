<p>It is therefore important to explore more plants that are locally widely available and of low cost, as potential sources of novel antibiotics (specifically against wound infected bacterial pathogens) to contribute to effective management of wound infections. To help achieve this goal, the current study evaluated ethanolic and aqueous extracts of five medicinal (
