 <xref rid="medsci-09-00023-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> presents results on mean zones of inhibition recorded for the aqueous and ethanolic plant extracts against the clinical bacteria isolates (See 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-medsci-09-00023">Supplementary File Tables S5â€“S7</xref> for zones of inhibition of individual isolates). For the clinical MDR isolates, 
 <italic>A. cordifolia</italic> from this study showed highest inhibition to growth of all bacteria, with the highest activity observed against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (mean zone of inhibition 21.4 mm = for aqueous extract and 23.4 mm for ethanolic extracts) (
 <xref rid="medsci-09-00023-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Activity of 
 <italic>J. flava</italic> against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> was highest (6.4 mm for aqueous and 1.6 mm for ethanol) as compared to that of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Similar observation was made for the other plants where high activity was observed against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>; 
 <italic>M. arboreus</italic> (1.3 mm for aqueous and 0.6 mm for ethanol) and 
 <italic>M. charantia</italic> (9.9 mm for aqueous and 11.1 mm for ethanol). Also, 
 <italic>P. guajava</italic> showed highest activity (16.1 mm for aqueous and 17.6 mm for ethanol) against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, followed by 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> with zone of inhibition of 2.4 mm for aqueous and 9.2 mm for ethanolic extract (
