<p>Regarding the antimicrobial activity of aqueous and ethanolic extracts against reference strains of bacteria, all plant extracts were observed to have some antimicrobial activity against at least one reference strain (
 <xref rid="medsci-09-00023-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). For 
 <italic>A. cordifolia</italic>, relatively high antimicrobial activity was observed for aqueous extracts with zone of inhibition ranging from 19 to 29 mm and ethanolic extracts with zone of inhibition ranging from 17 to 28 mm. For 
 <italic>J. flava</italic> and 
 <italic>M. arboreus</italic> mean zone of inhibition was zero for both 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> ATCC 25922 and 
 <italic>S. typhi</italic> ATCC 33458 with both aqueous and ethanolic extracts. However, 
 <italic>J. flava</italic> showed a relatively moderate activity against MRSA (zone of inhibition; aqueous = 15 mm, ethanol = 13 mm) and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 25923 (zone of inhibition; aqueous = 18 mm, ethanol = 16 mm). Similarly, 
 <italic>M. arboreus</italic> showed a relatively moderate activity against MRSA (zone of inhibition; aqueous = 15 mm, ethanol = 12 mm) and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 25923 (zone of inhibition; aqueous = 0 mm, ethanol = 12 mm).
