<p>With regards to the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, for Gram negative clinical isolates tested in this study, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> isolates showed the highest resistance of 79% (19/24) against cefepime but was highly susceptible to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (100% susceptibility) and meropenem (88% susceptibility). Also 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> isolates recorded resistance of 75% and 71% against amikacin and piperacillin/tazobactam respectively. The resistance recorded for 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> clinical isolates ranged from 21% (4/19) to 84% (16/19) among the antibiotics tested. The highest resistance of 84% was recorded among three antibiotics, namely; ciprofloxacin, cefepime and colistin (
