<p>The preliminary phytochemical analysis of the leaves of the five plants showed the presence of saponins, phenolics, and reducing sugars in all the plants with the exception of ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>J. flava</italic> which did not have saponins and the ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>M. charantia</italic> which did not have saponins and phenolics (

The presence of phytochemical compounds such as flavonoids, polyuronides, cardiac glycosides, anthracenosides, triterpens, phytosterol and alkaloids were not detected in the leaves of most of the plants used in this study in both aqueous and ethanolic extracts (
