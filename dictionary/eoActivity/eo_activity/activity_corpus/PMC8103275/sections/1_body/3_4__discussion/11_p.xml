<p>Additionally, some of the resistance displayed by the bacterial isolates could be due to biofilm formation. Biofilms provides protection to the bacteria, giving additional resistance power which makes them to not only tolerate harsh conditions but also resistant to antibiotics, which may lead to multi drug resistant, extensively drug resistant and totally drug resistant bacteria [
