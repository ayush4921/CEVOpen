<p>In this study, 
 <italic>P. guajava</italic> showing activity against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> confirms the observation by Abdelrahim et al. [
 <xref rid="B55-medsci-09-00023" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], who indicated that, in their study, all clinical isolates tested including that of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> were sensitive to extracts of 
 <italic>P. guajava</italic> [
 <xref rid="B55-medsci-09-00023" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. This observation confirms the traditional uses of this plant [
 <xref rid="B56-medsci-09-00023" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], which is also available in most parts of the study location (Ghana). According to Lins et al. [
 <xref rid="B56-medsci-09-00023" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], 
 <italic>P. guajava</italic> has numerous properties including antioxidant, anti-allergic, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial. This is likely the reason for which this plant and others investigated in the current study are widely used in traditional medicine for wound healing [
