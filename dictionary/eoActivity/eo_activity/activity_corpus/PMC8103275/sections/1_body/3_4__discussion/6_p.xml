<p>The antimicrobial investigations from this study showed 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> clinical isolates to have the highest resistance to cefepime, followed by amikacin and piperacillin/tazobactam, but was highly susceptible to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and meropenem. This observation is in contrast to what was recently observed in Ethiopia by Tekele et al. [
 <xref rid="B35-medsci-09-00023" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] where 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (from various clinical specimens such as urine, pus, body fluids, sputum, stool, ear and eye discharges) showed the highest resistance to ampicillin followed by amoxicillin with clavulanic acid. Also, although 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> isolates from this study showed the highest resistance to cefepime, followed by amikacin, a study by Yılmaz et al. [
 <xref rid="B36-medsci-09-00023" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] showed to 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (from urinary tract infections) as having the highest resistance to ampicillin. In that study [
 <xref rid="B36-medsci-09-00023" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] cefepime and amikacin recorded the 6th and 10th resistant antibiotics out of the 15 antibiotics they tested. However, similar to this study, Yılmaz et al. [
 <xref rid="B36-medsci-09-00023" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] observed high susceptibility to meropenem.
