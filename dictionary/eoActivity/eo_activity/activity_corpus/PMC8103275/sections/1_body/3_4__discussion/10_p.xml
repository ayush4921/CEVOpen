<p>Generally, possible reasons for these differences in resistance levels observed for all the isolates in this study as compared to other studies can be due to the methods employed for antimicrobial testing, variations in the pattern of indiscriminate usage of antibiotics, patients conditions (isolates from this study were solely from post-operative wound infections) and the nature of bacteria in these countries. Also, some of these drugs (like meropenem) have been on the Ghanaian market for a relatively short period of time compared to others whiles some are also very expensive and usually prescribed for serious infections compared to others. Thus, accounting for the relatively low levels of resistance observed in this study.</p>
