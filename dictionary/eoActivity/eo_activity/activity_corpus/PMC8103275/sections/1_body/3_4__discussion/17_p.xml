<p>The antimicrobial activity of the extracts could be attributed to the presence of flavonoids and other secondary metabolites. According to Agyare et al. [
 <xref rid="B53-medsci-09-00023" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] terpenoids are known to play a role in the antimicrobial activity of some plants due to the possible effect on the nonmevalonate pathway; a pathway that is very essential in most microorganisms (including Gram-negative bacteria) for the synthesis of cell membrane components and as a secondary source of carbon [

Therefore, as indicated earlier, future investigations using HPLC fingerprinting or HPTLC screening for all major phytochemicals and finding correlations between such secondary metabolites and the antimicrobial activity is in the right direction.
