 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> isolates showed highest susceptibility to standard antibiotics such as ampicillin (92% susceptibility) and vancomycin (75% susceptibility), but highly resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid with 83% (10/12). This pattern is similar to observations in Ethiopia where 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> was 100% sensitive to vancomycin [

 <xref rid="B41-medsci-09-00023" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] also observed 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> to show 75% resistance to ampicillin, however vancomycin recorded 11% resistance compared to 75% resistance recorded in this study. Deyno et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-medsci-09-00023" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] concluded that 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> in Ethiopia has gotten notoriously resistant to almost to all of antimicrobial agents in use, including, penicillin, cephalosporins, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, methicillin, vancomycin and sulphonamides. In the current study, the resistance level observed for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid is bothersome and requires due attention. Meanwhile, studies conducted in Ethiopia and Nepal found 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> to be susceptible to aminoglycosides, such as amikacin [
