<p>Akbari et al. [
 <xref rid="B31-medsci-09-00023" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] indicated that the recoveries of bioactive phytochemical compounds from plants are potentially affected by the conditions of extraction methods and different solvent formulations. Other investigators also asserted that the concentration of these compounds, which may or may not be detected in a phytochemical analysis, depends on the nature of the chemical used as solvent in the extraction process, as well the growth and storage conditions [

 <xref rid="B34-medsci-09-00023" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Based on all these reasons which may affect the detection of these compounds in the plants, it is therefore not surprising that some of these compounds were not detected. However, the absence of phenolics in 
 <italic>M. charantia</italic> leaves observed in the current study can be considered an interesting finding, since it is against previous knowledge; warranting further investigation. Meanwhile, the current study did not employ HPLC fingerprinting or HPTLC screening for the phytochemical analyses; a limitation that can be considered in future investigations, since these techniques may provide more comprehensive phytochemical investigation.
