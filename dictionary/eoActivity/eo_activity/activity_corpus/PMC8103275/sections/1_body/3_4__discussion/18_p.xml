<p>For 
 <italic>J. flava</italic> Agyare et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-medsci-09-00023" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] demonstrated that methanol leaf extract was active against 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ATCC 25922, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> ATCC 4853 and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC 25923. However there seem to be limited studies showing its efficacy against clinical strains, especially those of MDR isolates from post-operative wound infection. Generally, there seems to be just few studies on the medicinal properties of 
 <italic>J. flava</italic> although commonly available in Ghana [
