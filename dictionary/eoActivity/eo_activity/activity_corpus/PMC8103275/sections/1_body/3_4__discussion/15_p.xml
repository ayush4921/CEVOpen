<p>A study by Adeyemi et al. [
 <xref rid="B50-medsci-09-00023" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] on activity of three different plants (including 
 <italic>A. cordifolia</italic>) on isolates different from those studied in the current investigations showed all their three plant extracts to exhibit varying degrees of activity with 
 <italic>A. cordifolia</italic> being the most active. According to Adeyemi et al. [
 <xref rid="B50-medsci-09-00023" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] the antibacterial properties of 
 <italic>A. cordifolia</italic> has been extensively studied. Earlier Okeke et al. [
 <xref rid="B51-medsci-09-00023" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] had shown that it was very active against seventy four bacterial strains studied in vitro. Ajali [
 <xref rid="B52-medsci-09-00023" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] also made similar observations and the current finding is in line with these earlier reports; however adding that 
 <italic>A. cordifolia</italic> may be useful in management of post-operative wounds. Also, considering the abundance of 
 <italic>A. cordifolia</italic> in most parts of Ghana, this plant would be of benefit to many people in the study location.
