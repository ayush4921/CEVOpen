<p>Similar observation was made for the other plants where more activity was observed against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> for 
 <italic>M. arboreus</italic>, 
 <italic>M. charantia</italic>, 
 <italic>P. guajava</italic> and 
 <italic>J. flava</italic>. According to Agyare et al. [
 <xref rid="B53-medsci-09-00023" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] extracts of 
 <italic>Myrianthus arboreus</italic> and 
 <italic>Alchornea cordifolia</italic> show some level of antimicrobial activity against common pathogens that cause infections in wounds (especially 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aureginosa</italic>). For 
 <italic>M. charantia</italic>, similarly, Mwambete et al. [
 <xref rid="B54-medsci-09-00023" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] has shown antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. These pathogens (
 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> sp. and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp.) which are known to be among those commonly associated with wounds infections are also common in Ghana [
 <xref rid="B53-medsci-09-00023" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Therefore, finding various plants to have activity against these pathogens in the current study presents individuals who may prefer traditional medicine in the treatment of their post-operative wounds infected with MDR pathogens with a number of options; thus, readily using which of them is closely available to them.
