<p>The preliminary phytochemical screening of the aqueous and ethanolic extracts of the leaves of 
 <italic>Psidium guajava</italic>, 
 <italic>Myrianthus arboreus</italic>, 
 <italic>Alchornea cordifolia</italic>, 
 <italic>Momordica charantia</italic>, and 
 <italic>Justicia flava</italic> in this study showed that the predominant compounds present in the plants were saponins, phenolics and reducing sugars. This observation is similar to several studies with regards to the phytochemical constituents of these plants [

In terms of health benefit, both saponins and phenolic compounds existing in plants have demonstrated potential medicinal values for the treatment of numerous diseases such as cancers, heart-related illnesses, tumor, bacterial infections, and diabetes [
