<p>Like many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, Ghana hosts a number of plants with medicinal properties [

 <xref rid="B18-medsci-09-00023" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. For instance, Boakye et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-medsci-09-00023" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] determined the in vivo wound-healing activity of aqueous aerial part extract of a medicinal plant using the case of only Phyllanthus muellerianus. Agyare et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-medsci-09-00023" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] also evaluated the antimicrobial and wound healing potential of two plants; 
 <italic>Justicia flava</italic> and 
 <italic>Lannea welwitschii</italic>. However, most of these studies did not include a wide variety of plants and also did not target MDR wound isolates. Also, to the best of our knowledge, there seem to be limited attention given to post-operative wounds in this regard. To help fill this gap, the current study mainly evaluated ethanolic and aqueous extracts of five medicinal plants (
 <italic>Psidium guajava</italic>, 
 <italic>Myrianthus arboreus</italic>, 
 <italic>Alchornea cordifolia</italic>, 
 <italic>Momordica charantia</italic>, and 
 <italic>Justicia flava</italic>) for their antimicrobial activities against multidrug-resistant (MD-R) bacterial pathogens isolated from post-operative wounds. These low cost and easily accessible plants in Ghana have been suspected by natives to have wound healing properties, however, not all of these plants have been investigated. The current study therefore provides evidence supporting the antimicrobial activity of extracts of these plants against clinical bacterial isolates from wounds; alongside the preliminary phytochemical constituents of these plants.
