<p>For the antimicrobial activity of aqueous and ethanolic extracts against the clinical isolates, 
 <italic>Alchornea cordifolia</italic> from this study showed highest inhibition to growth of all bacteria used; the highest activity was observed against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> for both aqueous and ethanolic extracts whiles 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> was affected more by ethanolic extracts. Similarly, Igbenegu et al. [
 <xref rid="B48-medsci-09-00023" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] also reported that 
 <italic>A. cordifolia</italic> was active against multi-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Ebi [
 <xref rid="B49-medsci-09-00023" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] investigated the antimicrobial properties of methanol extracts of 
 <italic>A. cordifolia</italic> and observed that some fractions of the extracts, notably those containing phenolics and terpenoids, exhibited significant activity against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. It is worth noting that, in this study, 
 <italic>A. cordifolia</italic> also contained phenolics in both aqueous and ethanolic extracts. However, the isolates used in the current study are MDR and from post-operative wounds unlike that of Ebi [
 <xref rid="B49-medsci-09-00023" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] which could not be ascertained. Therefore, this plant may be very useful among individuals who may prefer traditional (herbal) medicine in the treatment of their post-operative wounds infected with MDR pathogens, such as those investigated in the current study.
