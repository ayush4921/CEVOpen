 <italic>P. aureginosa</italic> from this study was resistant to most antibiotics tested, with highest among them being ciprofloxacin, cefepime and colistin with 84% resistance. Similarly, Yayan et al. [
 <xref rid="B37-medsci-09-00023" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] have reported an elevated resistance of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and MDR 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> for cefepime in Germany. In a study by Siddiqua et al. [
 <xref rid="B38-medsci-09-00023" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] using 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> from clinical specimens (wound, pus and urine), the isolated pathogens showed resistance to cefepime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and gentamicin from 47% to 88%. All the isolates from their study were comparatively better susceptible to meropenem, similar to what is observed in this study with 79% susceptibility. However, ciprofloxacin which showed high resistance in this study also showed better susceptibility in their study. Studies in Ethiopia and India have noted 
 <italic>P. aureginosa</italic> to be highly resistant to many antibiotics [
 <xref rid="B39-medsci-09-00023" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-medsci-09-00023" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Therefore, judicious and rational treatment prescription by physicians to limit further the spread of antimicrobial resistance among the 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, as recommended by Siddiqua et al. [
 <xref rid="B38-medsci-09-00023" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] is highly supported by this study.
