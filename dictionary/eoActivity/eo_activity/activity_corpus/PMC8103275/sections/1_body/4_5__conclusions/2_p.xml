<p>Given the findings of this study, it is recommended that other plants which are being used by people in the treatment of wound infection be scientifically screened against MDR isolates. Also, since topical application of antimicrobials is an efficient therapeutic method of destroying microbial population because of the availability of the drug at the wound sites, further studies aimed at development of the plants investigated in the current study into topical forms for use in management of post-operative wounds is recommended.</p>
