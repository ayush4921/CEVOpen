<p>To detect cardiac glycosides, anthracenosides and flavonosides, 25 mL of the extracts was mixed in 10% 
 <italic>v/v</italic> hydrochloric acid (15 mL), refluxed for 30 min, cooled and extracted with diethyl ether (36 mL) in portions of 12 mL each. For cardiac glycosides, to a residue obtained by evaporating to dryness extracts (10 mL) was added acetic anhydride (0.50 mL) and chloroform (0.50 mL) and transferred into a dry tube. Concentrated Sulphuric acid (2 mL) was added by means of a pipette at the bottom of the tube forming reddish-brown ring at the contact zone of the two layers. For anthracenosides, the extract (4 mL) was added to concentrated Sulphuric acid (2 mL) and shaken with 25% 
 <italic>v/v</italic> ammonia solution (2 mL) forming cherished-red solution on the top layer. For, flavonosides the residue obtained by evaporating the extracts (5 mL) was heated in 50% methanol (2 mL). Metallic magnesium (0.5 g) and concentrated Hydrochloric acid (5 drops) was added forming a red solution.
