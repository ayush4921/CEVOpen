<p>For saponins, diluted solution of the extracts (2 mL) was placed in a test tube and shaken for 15 min. A soapy like column of about 2 cm formed above liquid level. For alkaloids, the extracts (15 mL) were evaporated to dryness in an oven at 55 °C and residue dissolved in 10% 
 <italic>v/v</italic> Hydrochloric acid (10 mL). Ten milliliters (10 mL) of 10% 
 <italic>v/v</italic> ammonia solution was added to precipitate the alkaloids and then extracted with ether (15 mL). The ether portion was evaporated to dryness and 1.5 mL of hydrochloric acid added. To 0.5 mL of the acidic solution was added 2–3 drops of Mayer’s reagents forming opalescence precipitate.
