<p>The agar well diffusion method (CLSI) was used to screen for antibacterial activity of the leaves with reference strains (

 <italic>Salmonella typhi</italic> ATCC 19430, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> ATCC 27853 and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC 25923, and a Methicillin-Resistant 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> strain) as well as the MDR clinical isolates from the wounds (
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>CoNS</italic>). About three to four isolated colonies of similar morphology were picked from the 18–24 h agar plate of pure cultures using a sterile loop, and then inoculated individually into 4 mL peptone broth (Sigma, P0556, Sigma-Aldrich Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA). The density/turbidity of the inoculum was adjusted to 0.5 McFarland turbidity standard, resulting in a suspension of 1.5 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU colony forming units.
