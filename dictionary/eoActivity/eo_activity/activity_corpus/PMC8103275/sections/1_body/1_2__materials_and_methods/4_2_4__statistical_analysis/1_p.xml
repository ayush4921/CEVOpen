<p>The data collected in the study were entered into MS Excel and analyzed using Minitab software version 15 (Minitab Inc., State College, PA, USA). Descriptive analysis was carried out on the various plant extracts. For the antibiotic susceptibility testing of bacterial isolates, zone diameters around the antibiotic discs were measured and classified as sensitive or resistant based on the CLSI break point system [

Isolates that were resistant to 3 or more antibiotics were labeled as multidrug resistant isolates and the proportions of such isolates were also recorded. For the antimicrobial activity evaluation of the plant extracts using agar well diffusion method, the zone diameters around the wells were measured in millimeters and recorded.
