<p>Preliminary phytochemical analysis using standard procedures described by Evans [
 <xref rid="B20-medsci-09-00023" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] was used to determine the phytochemical constituents present in the plants. Saponins, phenolics, reducing sugar, flavonoids, polyuronides, cardiac glycosides, anthracenosides, triterpenes, phytosterol and alkaloids were determined. Briefly, for reducing sugars, 1 mL of extracts was diluted with water (2 mL) in a test tube. Fehling’s solutions I (1 mL) and Fehling’s solution II (1 mL) were added and heated in a water bath at 90 °C, forming a brick-red precipitate.
