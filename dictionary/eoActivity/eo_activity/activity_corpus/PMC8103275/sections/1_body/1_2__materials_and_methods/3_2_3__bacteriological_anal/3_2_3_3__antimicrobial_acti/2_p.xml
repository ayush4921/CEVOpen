<p>Mueller Hinton agar plates (Oxoid, CM0337, Oxoid Ltd., Basingstoke, UK) were seeded with the test organisms and the plates left to dry for five minutes. After drying, wells were made in the agar using sterile cork borer measuring 9 mm in diameter. Hundred microliters (100 µL) of the aqueous and ethanolic extract of leaves were dispensed into the labelled wells. The plates were then kept in the refrigerator for one hour for the extract to diffuse into the medium. The plates were then incubated at 37 °C for 24 h (h) and the zones of inhibition were measured in millimeters. Analysis were done in duplicates.</p>
