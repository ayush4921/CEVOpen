<p>The antibiotic susceptibility testing procedure employed is briefly described as follows. The test organism was emulsified in peptone water until the turbidity was comparable with 0.5% McFarland’s standard. A loopful of the suspension was transferred onto a Mueller-Hinton agar plate (Sigma-Aldrich Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA), and then a sterile cotton swab was used to streak the entire surface of the plate. Sterile forceps were used to apply the antibiotic discs to the surface of the agar plate and incubated at 37 °C for 18–24 h. Zone diameters around the antibiotic discs were measured and classified as sensitive or resistant based on the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) break point system [
