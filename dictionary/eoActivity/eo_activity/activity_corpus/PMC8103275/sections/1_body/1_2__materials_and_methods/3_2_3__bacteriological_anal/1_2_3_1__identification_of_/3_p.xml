<p>Characterization of the bacterial isolates was done phenotypically based on colonial morphology, Gram staining and biochemical tests. Below are detailed description of the isolatesâ€™ characterization:
 <list list-type="simple">
  <list-item>
   <p>
    <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>: These isolates were characterized based on their presentation as Gram-negative rods in singles, indole-positive, motility-positive and lactose fermentation.
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>
    <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>: Characterization was based on their presentation as Gram-negative rods in singles, oxidase-positive and Pyocyanin (green pigment) production.
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>
    <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>: These isolates were characterized based on their presentation as Gram-positive cocci in clusters, catalase-positive and coagulase positive.
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>
    <italic>Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS)</italic>: Characterization was based on their presentation as Gram-positive Cocci in clusters, catalase-positive and coagulase negative.
