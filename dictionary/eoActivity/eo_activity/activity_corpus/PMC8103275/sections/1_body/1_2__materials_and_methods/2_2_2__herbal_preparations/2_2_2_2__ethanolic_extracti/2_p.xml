<p>Three and half liters of 70% 
 <italic>v/v</italic> ethanol was added to it and left to macerate for 4 days at room temperature (28–32 °C), with occasional stirring. After the 4 days, the 70% ethanol was decanted and filtered through a Whatman No. 1 filter paper (Sigma-Aldrich Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA). The extracts were then concentrated in an oven with relatively lower heat at 38 °C for 24 h and stored in a refrigerator at 4 °C.
