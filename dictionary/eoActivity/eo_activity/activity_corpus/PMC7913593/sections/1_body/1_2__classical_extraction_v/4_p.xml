<p>As a pro argument for modern extraction techniques, in addition to the reduced costs and energy, there is the use of a cascade of different solvents, which is due to the existence of a complex matrix of MAPs; this approach is conducive to the recovery of a large range of bioactive compounds. This is the case of Algerian

The recuperation of the solvents, especially the toxic ones such as acetone, can be performed under vacuum conditions, removing the possibility of contamination on the environment or on the final products. In addition to oxygenated monoterpenoids, such as camphor (11.7%) and geraniol (7.5%), and sesquiterpenoids and monoterpenoids, such as (E)-nerolidol (13.7%), terpinen-4-ol (10.6%), and camphor (7.6%), researchers also obtained geranyl acetate (6.3%) and β-terpinyl acetate (5.1%), caryophyllene oxide (5.1%) and borneol (5.6%), respectively β-terpinyl acetate (4.8%) and linalool (4%).
