<p>Modern extraction methods have attracted a great amount of interest in the last few years, especially due to their scale-up possibilities and their ability to provide superior quality extracts with economic benefits; a scientific and analytical approach must be conducted for this step. The classical extraction method can be also scaled up, but factors such as instrumentation, batch/flow process, kinetics, economics, energy consumption, and amounts of wastes tilt the balance toward the scale up of non-conventional extraction techniques, such as microwaves or ultrasonic-assisted, supercritical fluid, negative cavitation, pressurized fluid, etc. [
