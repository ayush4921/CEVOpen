<p>Even from the beginning of the 1990s, the interest in using natural compounds in industrial applications started in controlling the postharvest disease of citrus fruits [

 <italic>Thymus capitatus</italic> essential oil) as an alternative method to prolong the shelf life of perishable fruits (strawberries) [

 <italic>Eryngium campestre</italic> essential oil encapsulated in chitosan nanoparticles was developed to reduce the microbial counts and to extend the shelf life of sweet cherries, farnesene being identified as the main responsible compounds for the antimicrobial effects [
