<p>OEO has also a beneficial effect when it is encapsulated in polymeric matrixes, and different studies being conducted toward both developing new materials that can limit the volatility of the essential oil and obtaining a controlled release for the topical application. This is the case of nanocomposite films based on poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and alphachitin nanocrystals (α-CHNC, from shrimp and lobster), which are conductive to a “green” character of the treatment [
