<p>In this context, there are many studies reporting biological effects that can be attributed to MAPs or derived products, against several diseases, such as cancer, neurological, respiratory, inflammatory, cardiovascular diseases, and many others [

Using phytoconstituents or natural-based products as complementary treatments improved the oxidative status, which is due to their activity in compensating the inefficacy of the endogenous defense systems and in the enhancement of the overall antioxidant response [
