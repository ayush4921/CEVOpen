 <title>Ethics approval and consent to participate</title>
 <p id="Par52">This study was reviewed and approved by the Research Deputy at the University of Jiroft. The organization of the institute does not involve an Ethics Committee; therefore, there is no specific ethics code assigned to this study. However, each research proposal, like the one corresponding to the current study, is comprehensively reviewed by the university until an approval code is granted (No: 3818-97-6). We would like to clarify that this study did not involve any intervention and all questions from local informants were performed with prior verbal consent.</p>
