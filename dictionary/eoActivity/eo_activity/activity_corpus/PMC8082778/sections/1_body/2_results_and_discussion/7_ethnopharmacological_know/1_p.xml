<p id="Par44">In the hot and dry regions of Kerman province like Kahnuj, Roodbar, Anbarabad, Qale Ganj, Manojan, Faryab, Bam, Fahraj, Narmashir, Rigan, and plain part of Jiroft, most inhabitants are from Baluch tribe and the natives of Jiroft and Kahnooj. Based on the results, medicinal plants such as 
 <italic>Berberis integerrima</italic>, 
 <italic>R. persica</italic>, 
 <italic>Calotropis procera</italic>, and 
 <italic>R. stricta</italic> are widely used to treat dermatological diseases. The rate of drug abuse in these regions is more than in mountainous areas because these cities are in the neighborhood of Afghanistan and the availability of drugs is thus higher. Hence, medicinal plants such as the plant from the genus 
 <italic>Achillea</italic> (
 <italic>A. wilhelmsii</italic>, 
 <italic>A. eriophora</italic>, 
 <italic>A. santolinoides</italic>), 
 <italic>Berberis integerrima</italic>, and 
 <italic>R. persica</italic> are used individually or in combination by the locals for stopping drug abuse.
