 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Field discussion and other similar reports [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] indicated that availability, abundance, efficiency of use, and attention to the conservation points are the main reasons for the maximum usage of the leaves by local healers. In fact, local informants believed that different parts of the medicinal plants could have different therapeutic effects. In other words, plant organs have received varying degrees of attention based on traditional herbal medicine experiences of the ethnic communities. For instance, the root of 
 <italic>Berberis integerrima</italic> is decocted and taken orally to treat diabetes while its leaf is used to treat hypertension. In addition, latex of 
 <italic>Calotropis procera</italic> was used to cure eczema but its leaf is taken in the form of poultice to treat bruise and diabetes.
