    "COVID-19, a new pandemic of coronavirus (CoV), was reported in Wuhan, China, in 2019. No specific drugs are available and investigations regarding COVID-19 treatment are proceeding. Lan et al. (2020) successfully crystallized the COVID-19 spike receptor-binding domain bounding to the ACE2 receptor, which is a potential drug target. The present study aimed to assess 716 bioactive compounds found in the South Atlantic Ocean as potential COVID-19 Spike inhibitors, using a molecular docking study. Molecular docking was performed using Autodock Vina to analyze the probability of docking. COVID-19 Spike was docked with several compounds, and docking was virtually screened by Chimera, Pymol, and Biovia Discovery Studio and test for draggability using SWISSADME. The analysis shows that 11 NPs out of 716 are predicted to be Spike inhibitors by blocking the amino acids responsible for binding Spike to ACE2. However, further findings are necessary to experimentally investigated for their potential medicinal use."
