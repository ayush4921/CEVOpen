<p>CAT activity was measured using 1 mL of 10% PMS with equal volumes of 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer and 0.09 M H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>. The decrease in sample absorbance was recorded after every 30 s at 240 nm and CAT activity was expressed as nmol H

 <sub>2</sub> consumed/min/mg of protein. For tissue GST estimation, change in absorbance of reaction mixture (0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, 1 mM 1-choloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), 1 mM reduced glutathione and 10% PMS) was recorded at 340 nm and values were expressed as nmol of CDNB conjugates formed/min/mg of protein.
