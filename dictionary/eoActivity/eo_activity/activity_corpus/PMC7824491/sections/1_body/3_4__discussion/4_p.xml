<p>Lipid peroxidation is an extensively used biomarker to assess oxidative-stress-related damages in animal tissues [
 <xref rid="B35-animals-11-00048" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In our study, dietary black seed supplementation decreased lipids peroxidation level in all the studied tissues of rohu. 
 <italic>Sparus aurata</italic> fed with 
 <italic>Trigonella foenum graecum</italic> supplemented diets for three weeks showed decreased lipid peroxidation levels in their muscles [

 <xref rid="B34-animals-11-00048" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The results of the present study revealed increased CAT, GST, GPx and GSH levels in all the studied tissues of rohu fed black seed supplemented diets. The dietary 
 <italic>Ocimum gratissimum</italic> supplementation increased serum CAT and GST activities in 
 <italic>Clarias gariepinus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B40-animals-11-00048" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Dietary 
 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> supplementation for two months increased hepatic GPx and GSH levels in 
 <italic>Ctenopharyngodon idella</italic> [
 <xref rid="B55-animals-11-00048" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The increased activities of these antioxidant enzymes are attributed to the bioactive phytochemical components found in black seed (O-cymene; 2-isopropylidene-5-methylhex-4-enal; limonen-6-ol, pivalate; longifolene; phenol,4-methoxy-2,3,6-trimethyl; l-(+)-ascorbic acid 2,6-dihexadecanoate and 1-heptatriacotanol), which has free radicals scavenging properties, thus making them a potent antioxidant agent [
