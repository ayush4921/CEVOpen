  <p>Antinociceptive effect of the topical application of NanoBEO (1 mg/mouse) on the 0.5% formalin test. The nociceptive behavior induced by formalin has been scored as the amount of time spent licking and biting the injected paw. Empty cream (1 mg/mouse) has been used as a control and this has failed to affect the formalin-induced nociceptive response. Values are expressed as mean Â± SEM (
   <italic>n</italic> = 8). Values of 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 have been considered statistically significant. Improvement over control of 59.78%, ** 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01.
