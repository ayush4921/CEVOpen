  <p>Antinociceptive effect of topical application of NanoBEO (1 mg/mouse) on capsaicin-induced licking/biting behavior. The duration of licking/biting induced by capsaicin has been determined using the 5-min period starting immediately after the injection of capsaicin. Empty cream (1 mg/mouse) has been used as a control and this has failed to affect the capsaicin-induced nociceptive response. Values are expressed as mean Â± SEM (
   <italic>n</italic> = 8). Values of 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 have been considered statistically significant. Improvement over control of 59.26%, ** 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01.
