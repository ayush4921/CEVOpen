  <p>Anti-scratching effect of intradermal (i.d.) administration of NanoBEO on 4-methyl-histamine-induced behavior. The NanoBEO (1 mg/mouse) was used as pretreatment (30 min) (
   <bold>a</bold>) or immediately after (
   <bold>b</bold>) and has resulted as effective on the scratching behavior under both circumstances. The scratching time has been scored as seconds per 30 min. Empty cream (1 mg/mouse) has been used as a control and this has failed to affect itching. Values are expressed as mean Â± SEM (
   <italic>n</italic> = 8). Values of 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 have been considered statistically significant. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Improvement over control of 53.13%, *** 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; (
   <bold>b</bold>) improvement over control of 56.67%, *** 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001.
