<p>To evaluate BEO-BF content, the α-TFS-SLN formulation (1 mL) was diluted to 10 mL with methanol and analyzed by spectrophotometric detection at wavelengths of 281 nm for linalool, 208 nm for linalyl acetate, and 247 nm for limonene. The results indicated the presence of 27% of linalool, 31% of linalyl acetate, and 36% of limonene. After two and six months of light exposure, these percentages declined by 10% and 18%, respectively, with no further degradation at twelve months, demonstrating that α-TFS-SLNs effectively slowed down the degradation of BEO-BF.</p>
