<p>In conclusion, our data lend support to the use of the engineered nanotechnology delivery system based on SLN loaded with BEO-BF and devised in the pharmaceutical form of an odorless cream (NanoBEO) in the control of agitation in dementia. In fact, NanoBEO maintains the analgesic properties of the phytocomplex and it is smell-devoid, now allowing efficacy and safety to be established in double-blind clinical trials in demented patients.</p>
