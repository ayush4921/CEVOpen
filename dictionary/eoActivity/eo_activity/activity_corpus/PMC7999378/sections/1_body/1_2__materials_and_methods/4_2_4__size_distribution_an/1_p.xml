<p>The size of the α-TFS-SLN was determined by dynamic light scattering using a 90 Plus Particle Size Analyzer (Brookhaven Instruments Corporation, Holtsville, NY, USA) at 25 °C by measuring the autocorrelation function at a 90° scattering angle. Cells were filled with 100 µL of the sample solution and diluted to 4mL with filtered (0.22 µm) water. The polydispersity index indicating the measure of the distribution of the nanoparticle population was also determined [
