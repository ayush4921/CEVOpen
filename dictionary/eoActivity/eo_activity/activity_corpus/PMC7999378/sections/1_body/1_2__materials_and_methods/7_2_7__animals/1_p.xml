<p>Male ddY (SD) mice (Shizuoka Laboratory Center, Japan; Japan SLC, Hamamatsu, Japan; Kyudo Industries, Kumamoto, Japan) weighing 22–26 g at the time of testing were used. The mice were individually housed in a colony maintained in a controlled environment (12 h light/dark cycle, room temperature 23 °C, 50–60% relative humidity). The animals had free access to food pellets and water. All behavioral experiments took place during the light period between 10:00 and 17:00 h in a quiet room. The animals were tested in a randomized order. All experiments were performed following the approval of the Ethics Committee for Animal Experiments of the Daiichi University of Pharmacy and the Tohoku Pharmaceutical University (Examination number of Daiichi University of Pharmacy: H29-005, approval number: 17003; 30 June 2017) and in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guides for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals [

The experimental design and statistical power analysis were established to minimize the number of animals used while still generating reliable results, to meet with the scope of the 3R approach to refine, reduce, and, at least in part, replace. According to the statistical power calculation based on similar studies in the literature,
