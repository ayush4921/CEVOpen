<p>Mice were placed into a transparent cage (22.0 cm × 15.0 cm × 12.5 cm high) which also served as an observation chamber and were allowed to adapt to their environment for 1 h before testing. After this period, a plantar subcutaneous injection of 20 μL formalin (0.5% in saline) using a microsyringe with a 26-gauge needle was performed [
 <xref rid="B35-pharmaceutics-13-00379" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The low concentration of 0.5% formalin produced only the phasic (acute) paw-licking response, lasting the first 5 min after the formalin injection. NanoBEO (1 mg/mouse) and control (1 mg/mouse) was applied around the plantar surface of the right hind paw using a cotton swab 30 min prior to the formalin injection. Each mouse was immediately returned to the observation chamber after formalin injection. The accumulated response time in seconds spent in licking and biting of the injected hind paw was defined as a nociceptive response and the total time (s) of the response was measured with a hand-held stop-watch for a period of 5 min immediately after the subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of formalin.
