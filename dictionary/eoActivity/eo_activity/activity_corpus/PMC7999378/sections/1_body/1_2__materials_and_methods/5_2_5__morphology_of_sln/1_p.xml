<p>The morphology of the hydrated SLN dispersions was examined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In particular, a drop of SLN dispersion was applied to a carbon-coated copper grid and left for 1 min to allow some of the particles to adhere to the carbon substrate. The excess of dispersion was removed by adsorbing the drop with a piece of filter paper. A drop of 1% phosphotungstic acid solution was applied and, again, the excess of the solution was removed by adsorbing the liquid with the tip of a filter paper and the sample was air-dried. The sample was observed under a ZEISS EM 900 electron microscope (Oberkochen, Germany) at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV (
