<p>Mice were anesthetized by isoflurane (2.0%, FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation, Osaka, Japan). NanoBEO and control were administered on postoperative day 7. The sciatic nerve of the right hindlimb was exposed at the high thigh level through a small incision and the distal one-third to one-half of the dorsal portion of the sciatic nerve was tied with non-absorbable silk thread [

Immediately following surgery, the animals were kept in a soft bag cage with some food inside so that they could feed themselves without having difficulty standing. The wound healed within 1 to 2 days, and the mice with ligated nerves did not present signs of foot clonus or autotomy but behaved normally. The presence of mechanical allodynia (sensitization) was determined by the von Frey test. Animals were allowed to habituate to the testing environment and Plexiglass observation chamber (9.0 × 9.0 × 14.0 cm, length × width × height, Ugo Basile, Gemonio, Italy) with a wire mesh floor for approximately 1 h prior to testing. Calibrated von Frey filaments (pressure stimulus 0.40 g, Natsume Seisakusho Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) were then applied to the right plantar surface of the hind paw of the mice. The paw withdrawal threshold was evaluated using the up-down method. NanoBEO (1 mg/mouse) and control (1 mg/mouse) was applied around the plantar surface of the right hind paw using a cotton swab 30 min prior to the von Frey test. All the testing was performed by a blind observer.
