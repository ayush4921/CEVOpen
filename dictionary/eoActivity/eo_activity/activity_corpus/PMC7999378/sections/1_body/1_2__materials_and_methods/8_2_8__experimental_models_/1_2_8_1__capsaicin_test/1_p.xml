<p>Antinociception was assessed using the capsaicin test as previously described [
 <xref rid="B33-pharmaceutics-13-00379" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-pharmaceutics-13-00379" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. To reduce variability, each mouse was acclimatized to an acrylic observation chamber (22.0 × 15.0 × 12.5 cm) for approximately 1 h before the injection of capsaicin. The mouse was injected with 20 μL of a solution of capsaicin (0.8 μg/paw) beneath the skin of the plantar surface of the right hind paw using a 50 μL Hamilton microsyringe with a 26-gauge needle as quickly as possible, with only minimal animal restraint. Following capsaicin injection, the animals were immediately placed in the test box for a 5-min observation period. Licking/biting behavior induced by the intraplantar injection of capsaicin was observed as an indicator of nociceptive response. NanoBEO (1 mg/mouse) and control (1 mg/mouse) was applied around the plantar surface of the right hind paw using a cotton swab 30 min prior to the capsaicin injection. The accumulated response time in seconds spent in licking/biting the capsaicin-injected hind paw was measured for a period of 5 min immediately after the subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of capsaicin.
