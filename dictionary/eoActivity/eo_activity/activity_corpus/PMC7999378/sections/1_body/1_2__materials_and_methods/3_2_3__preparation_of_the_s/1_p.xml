<p>The α-TFS was synthesized as previously described [
 <xref rid="B27-pharmaceutics-13-00379" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Briefly, α-TF (1.0 g, 5.15 mmol), 
 <italic>p</italic>-toluene sulfonic acid (0.07 g, 0.34 mmol), and stearyl alcohol (0.7 g, 5.4 mmol) was added to 10 mL dry toluene under stirring and N
 <sub>2</sub> at room temperature. The solution was stirred under N
 <sub>2</sub> for 12 h at 110 °C. After cooling at room temperature, the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure, the residue treated with 15mL water, and the aqueous phase was extracted with chloroform (4 × 15mL). The combined organic phases were collected and dried using sodium sulfate (Na
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>), a common inorganic drying agent that acquires water hydration when exposed to moist air or a wet solution. Afterward, the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation to give a yellow-colored α-TFS and it was purified by Merck silica gel (60–230 mesh) column chromatography, using ethylacetate/
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane85/15 (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) as the eluent. The solvent of eluated ester was evaporated under reduced pressure. The α-TFS was identified by TLC, UV, and 1H-NMR analyses [

 <xref rid="B30-pharmaceutics-13-00379" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The α-TFS (142 mg, 0,201 mmol) was mixed with BEO-BF by heating at a temperature lower than temperatures that degrade BEO, preferably in the range of 60–65 °C. Then, a warm water (0.21 mg, 6% of α-TFS 0.0012 mmol) solution of sodium taurodeoxycholate (25.33 mg, 30% α-TFS, 0.061 mmol), butanol (0.3 mg, 2% of α-TFS, 0.0041 mmol), and Tween 20 (75 mg, 30% of α-TFS, 0.061 mmol) was added to obtain an optically transparent microemulsion. Sodium taurodeoxycholate and Tween 20 acted as emulsifiers and butanol as co-emulsifier. The warm microemulsion was immediately dispersed in cold water (2 °C) under high-speed homogenization (Model SL2, Silverson, Chesham Bucks, England) at 8000 rpm for 30 min (240,000 g in 30 min). The volume ratio of warm microemulsion to cold water was 1:20. The α-TFS-SLN dispersions were washed twice using an Amicon TCF2A ultrafiltration system (Amicon Grace, Beverley, MA, USA; membrane Amicon Diaflo YM 100).
