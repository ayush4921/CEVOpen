<p>The effect of NanoBEO was also studied on the scratching behavior induced by 4-methyl-histamine administration [
 <xref rid="B37-pharmaceutics-13-00379" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Scratching belongs to behavioral disturbances shown by patients affected by dementia. Mice have been pretreated with NanoBEO BEO-BF cream (1 mg/mouse) or control cream (1 mg/mouse) for transdermal application 30 min prior or immediately before intradermal administration of 4 methyl-histamine (200 µg/µL) and the scratching behavior was filmed for 30 min and measured offline by an independent observer. The 4-methyl-histamine is a pharmacological tool used to induce itching behavior in mice. The latency time was 10 min. The occurrence of scratching behavior in the mice subjected only to 4-methyl-histamine administration was observed. This behavior was more intense in the first minute of observation, but it occurred also from 2 min and 40 s and was completely prevented by the topical application of NanoBEO.
