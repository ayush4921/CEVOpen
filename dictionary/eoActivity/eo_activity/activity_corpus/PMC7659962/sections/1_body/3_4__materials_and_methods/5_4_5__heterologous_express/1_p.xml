<p>HEK 293 cells transfected with rat TRPA1 (HEK rTRPA1) or human TRPV1 (HEK hTRPV1) were a generous gift from Dr. Luciano De Petrocellis (ICB-CNR, Naples, Italy). Cells were cultured in minimum essential medium (MEM) (Gibco, Madison, WI, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone Labs, Logan, UT, USA), 1% Pen-Strep (Gibco), 1% nonessential amino acids (Gibco), and 2-mM Glutamax (Gibco) and maintained under 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> at 37 Â°C. Following the second passage, the growth medium was supplemented with 0.6-mg/mL geneticin/G418 (VWR, Randor, PA, USA) to induce the stable expression of the TRPA1 and TRPV1 ion channels.
