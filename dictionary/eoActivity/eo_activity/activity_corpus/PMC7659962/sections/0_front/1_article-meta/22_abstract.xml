 <p>Little is known about the pharmacological activity of 
  <italic>Monarda fistulosa</italic> L. essential oils. To address this issue, we isolated essential oils from the flowers and leaves of 
  <italic>M. fistulosa</italic> and analyzed their chemical composition. We also analyzed the pharmacological effects of 
  <italic>M. fistulosa</italic> essential oils on transient receptor potential (TRP) channel activity, as these channels are known targets of various essential oil constituents. Flower (MEO
  <sub>Fl</sub>) and leaf (MEO
  <sub>Lv</sub>) essential oils were comprised mainly of monoterpenes (43.1% and 21.1%) and oxygenated monoterpenes (54.8% and 77.7%), respectively, with a high abundance of monoterpene hydrocarbons, including 
  <italic>p</italic>-cymene, γ-terpinene, α-terpinene, and α-thujene. Major oxygenated monoterpenes of MEO
  <sub>Fl</sub> and MEO
  <sub>Lv</sub> included carvacrol and thymol. Both MEO
  <sub>Fl</sub> and MEO
  <sub>Lv</sub> stimulated a transient increase in intracellular free Ca
  <sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca
  <sup>2+</sup>]
  <sub>i</sub>) in TRPA1 but not in TRPV1 or TRPV4-transfected cells, with MEO
  <sub>Lv</sub> being much more effective than MEO
  <sub>Fl</sub>. Furthermore, the pure monoterpenes carvacrol, thymol, and β-myrcene activated TRPA1 but not the TRPV1 or TRPV4 channels, suggesting that these compounds represented the TRPA1-activating components of 
  <italic>M. fistulosa</italic> essential oils. The transient increase in [Ca
  <sup>2+</sup>]
  <sub>i</sub> induced by MEO
  <sub>Fl</sub>/MEO
  <sub>Lv</sub>, carvacrol, β-myrcene, and thymol in TRPA1-transfected cells was blocked by a selective TRPA1 antagonist, HC-030031. Although carvacrol and thymol have been reported previously to activate the TRPA1 channels, this is the first report to show that β-myrcene is also a TRPA1 channel agonist. Finally, molecular modeling studies showed a substantial similarity between the docking poses of carvacrol, thymol, and β-myrcene in the binding site of human TRPA1. Thus, our results provide a cellular and molecular basis to explain at least part of the therapeutic properties of these essential oils, laying the foundation for prospective pharmacological studies involving TRP ion channels.
