<p>The diseases affecting blueberry crops in northwestern Michoac√°n, Mexico, cause significant losses in production. This study identified three fungi that are often isolated from plants with symptoms of dieback and cancers: 
 <italic>P. clavispora</italic>, 
 <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic> and 
 <italic>L. pseudotheobromae</italic>. The first two have already been reported in blueberry crops by other studies [
