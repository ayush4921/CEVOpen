<p>Given the significant problems caused by these fungi in the cultivation of blueberry, the use of plant extracts from medicinal plants has been considered as a control alternative [
 <xref rid="B30-plants-10-00852" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This study shows that extracts of 
 <italic>L. hirta</italic>, 
 <italic>A. ochroleuca</italic> and 
 <italic>A. Porophyllum</italic> have antifungal activity in vitro. Among the best treatments, the inhibitory effect (100%) of the extract M5L (AcOEt) of 
 <italic>L. hirta</italic> on 
 <italic>P. Clavispora</italic> and 
 <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic> was most prominent. Another study showed that extracts of other species of the same genus (
 <italic>L. camera</italic>) have an antifungal effect against 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> but not against 
 <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic> [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-10-00852" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. We found no reports on the antifungal effect of extracts of 
 <italic>L. hirta</italic> against these or other pathogens of blueberry.
