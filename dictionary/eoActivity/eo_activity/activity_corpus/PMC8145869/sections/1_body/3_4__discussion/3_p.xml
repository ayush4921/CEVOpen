<p>Another extract based on 
 <italic>A. ochroleuca</italic> that inhibited 100% of the growth of both pathogens (at a concentration of 5 mg/mL) was M6LFr (AcOEt). These results are important because the antifungal effect of this extract was similar to that of the commercial fungicide Thiabendazole, which was used as positive control. Other studies have noted the antifungal effect of methanol extracts of 
 <italic>A. ochroleuca</italic> against 
 <italic>Fusarium sporotrichum</italic> ATCC 3299, 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic>, 
 <italic>Trichophyton mentagrophytes</italic> and
