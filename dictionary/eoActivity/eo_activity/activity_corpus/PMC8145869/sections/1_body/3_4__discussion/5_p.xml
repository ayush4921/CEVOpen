<p>To carry out a preliminary approach to the chemical nature of the compounds present in fractions extracts with the highest antifungal activity, a GC-MS analysis was performed. The major compounds in the active fractions of the M5L extract of 
 <italic>L. hirta</italic> were the diterpene Phytol and the triterpene α-Sitosterol. Phytol is a common compound in extracts of plants such as 
 <italic>Porophyllum linaria</italic> [

 <italic>Vitex negundo</italic> [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-10-00852" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], 
 <italic>Rhaponticum acaule</italic> [
 <xref rid="B33-plants-10-00852" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and 
 <italic>Apium nodiflorum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B34-plants-10-00852" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. It has also been reported as one of the main components of the essential oil of 
 <italic>A. nodiflorum</italic>, which showed antifungal activity against yeasts, dermatophytes, and 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp. [
 <xref rid="B34-plants-10-00852" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The triterpene α-sitosterol has been isolated from 
 <italic>Leucas aspera</italic> [
 <xref rid="B35-plants-10-00852" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].
