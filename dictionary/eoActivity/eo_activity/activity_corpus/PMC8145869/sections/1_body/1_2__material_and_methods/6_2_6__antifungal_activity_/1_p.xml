<p>A total of 12 extracts were obtained. Each extract was assayed with 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 mg/mL. The effect of the crude extracts on the mycelial growth of the fungi isolated from blueberry was evaluated according to the method proposed by Sánchez-Pérez et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-plants-10-00852" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Each concentration was added to Petri dishes with PDA culture medium; 30 min after to allow the evaporation of EtOH and the diffusion of the extract, a disc of 5 mm in diameter with PDA and mycelium of the corresponding strain was placed in the center of the dish, which was then incubated at 28 °C. In addition, we included an absolute control (PDA + fungus), a negative control (PDA + fungus + EtOH) and a positive control (PDA + fungus + Thiabendazole 5 mg/mL, TECTO 60
 <sup>®</sup> wettable powder, 600 g IA kg
 <sup>−1</sup>). All bioassays were performed in triplicate. The effect of extracts and fractions was determined by measuring the diameter of the colonies with a digital vernier (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and expressed as the percentage inhibition of mycelial growth compared to the negative control, according to the formula: % inhibition = average mycelial growth of the control-average mycelial growth of the treatment/average mycelial growth of the control × 100 [
