<p>Diseased plants with symptoms of wilt, blight, canker and dieback were collected from plots in the following four municipalities that produce blueberries in the northwest of the state of Michoacán, Mexico: Emiliano Zapata, Los Palillos, La Magdalena and San Gregorio. The fungi were isolated according to the procedure previously published [
 <xref rid="B16-plants-10-00852" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. For this, fragments of diseased tissue of approximately 10 × 10 mm were obtained from the diseased plants collected; disinfested with 3% (
 <italic>v/v</italic>) sodium hypochlorite for 2 min, rinsed three times with sterile distilled water; and dried on sterile paper napkins for 20 min, in a laminar flow cabinet (CHC Biolus
 <sup>®</sup>, Daejeon, Korea). Five fragments of sick tissue were transferred per Petri dishes containing potato-dextrose-agar culture medium (PDA, Bioxon
 <sup>®</sup>, Estado de México, Mexico) and incubated at 28 °C for 4–7 days, until fungal growth. The fungal isolates were purified using the hyphal tip technique, as follows: the colonies were transferred to water-agar culture medium (20%) (Bioxon
 <sup>®</sup>), where they were left to grow for 3 days at 28 °C; hyphal tips were then removed and transferred individually to PDA medium. The fungi grown on PDA were kept on sterile filter paper (2 cm
 <sup>2</sup>) for 15 days. Finally, they were placed in a sterile container and left in refrigeration at 5 °C until further use.
