<p>The fractions with the strongest antifungal effect were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) using the fragrance method [
 <xref rid="B24-plants-10-00852" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. From each sample, 1 µL was analyzed with an Agilent 6890 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) Gas Chromatography equipment with an HP-5MS (5% Phenyl 95% dimethylpolysiloxane) capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm with 0.25 µm film thickness), which was coupled to an Agilent 5973N selective mass detector. Helium was used as a carrier gas at 7.67 psi with a 1.0 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup> constant flow. The front inlet was maintained at 280 °C in a split ratio of 50:1. The initial oven temperature was set at 50 °C, which was increased to 280 °C at a rate of 5 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup> and then held for 1 min at this constant temperature, subsequently increased to 380 °C at a rate of 25 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup> and finally held at the temperature of 380 °C for 3 min. The mass spectrometer was operated in electrical ionization mode (EI), with a flow of 1 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup>, 70 eV ionization voltage, the interface temperature at 300 °C and a scan range of 50–500 m/z. The compounds were identified by comparing the mass spectra of each constituent with those stored in the NIST02.L database. We only accepted peaks with a degree of purity of one, and the spectra were identified using a concordance threshold of 90%. The relative abundance of each compound was estimated by dividing its peak area by the sum of the areas of all peaks detected in the sample (total peak area).
