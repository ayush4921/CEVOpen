<p>Pathogenicity tests were performed on months-old blueberry plants (cv. Biloxi) obtained from Centro Regional Universitario Centro Occidente (CRUCO) of Chapingo Autonomous University, Campus Morelia, Michoac√°n. Each plant was transplanted into plastic pots (8 L) with a soil (80%) and chicken manure vermicompost-based substrate (20%). Pure four days-old fungal cultures were used for inoculation. The experimental design consisted of randomized blocks with four treatments (three fungi and a single control with PDA only) and five repetitions. Three stems of each plant (experimental unit) were inoculated through a 1 cm incision on which a disc (5 mm in diameter) with PDA and mycelium of the corresponding strain was placed; parafilm was used to keep the disc firmly on the stem. The plants were inspected daily until the onset of symptoms.</p>
