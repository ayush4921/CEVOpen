<p>The plants were sectioned into roots, stems, leaves, flowers and fruits, which were disinfected with 1% sodium hypochlorite, rinsed with distilled water and dried with absorbent paper [
 <xref rid="B18-plants-10-00852" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The crude extracts were obtained from the following plant organs: leaf (L) and flower (Fl) of 
 <italic>L. hirta</italic>; leaf-fruit (LFr) and root (R) of 
 <italic>A. ochroleuca</italic>; and leaf-stem (LS) and leaf of 
 <italic>A. porophyllum</italic>. These organs were dehydrated in an oven (CRAFT
 <sup>®</sup>, Ciudad de México, Mexico) at 50 °C for three days; they were then left at room temperature (25 °C ± 2.0) for five days [
 <xref rid="B19-plants-10-00852" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and ground using a conventional blender. The extracts were obtained by maceration [
 <xref rid="B20-plants-10-00852" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]; 15 g of the dry and ground material were mixed with 100 mL of absolute ethanol (EtOH, J.T. Baker
 <sup>®</sup>) or 100 mL of ethyl acetate (AcOEt, J.T. Baker
 <sup>®</sup>) to obtain each extract. Each mixture was placed in separate 200 mL beakers, which were kept in the dark and left to stand for 120 h at room temperature (25 °C ± 2.0). After this time, the extracts were filtered (Whatman
 <sup>®</sup> filter paper no. 5) and dried at 50 °C in a rotary evaporator (Brinkmann/Büchi
 <sup>®</sup>). They were then weighed and all the extracts were re-dissolved in EtOH, adjusted to a concentration of 100 mg/mL and stored at 4 °C until further use.
