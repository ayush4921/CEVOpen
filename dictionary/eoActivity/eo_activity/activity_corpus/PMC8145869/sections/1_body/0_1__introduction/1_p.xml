<p>The main producers of blueberry are the United States, Canada and Poland; Mexico is ranked 18th. In this country, the major producing states are Michoacán and Jalisco, with 37,090 t produced in 2019 [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-10-00852" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In the northwestern region of the state of Michoacán, Mexico, the production of blueberry is affected by various factors; among the most important are diseases caused by 
 <italic>Pestalotiopsis</italic> sp.; 
 <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> sp.; and other fungi belonging to the family Botryosphaeriaceae, such as 
 <italic>Lasiodiplodia theobromae</italic>,

 <xref rid="B4-plants-10-00852" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. These fungi have the ability to affect fruits and stems, causing the disease known as dieback [

 <xref rid="B6-plants-10-00852" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], which is responsible for significant losses in the production of blueberries and the increase in production costs related to fungicides. The continuous and indiscriminate use of fungicides causes adverse effects to human health and the environment [
 <xref rid="B7-plants-10-00852" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], which, together with the increasing demand for blueberries, current regulations on chemical pesticides and the emergence of resistant pathogens, justifies the search for new active molecules that can be used as control agents against phytopathogenic fungi [
