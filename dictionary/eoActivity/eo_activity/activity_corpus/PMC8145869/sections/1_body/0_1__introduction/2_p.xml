<p>Secondary metabolites with fungicidal properties have biological activity against phytopathogenic fungi and are, therefore, a viable control option. They are biodegradable to non-toxic products and could be a sustainable tool as bio-pesticides in integrated pest management programs [

The state of Michoacán, Mexico, has an enormous wealth of plant species and important cultural traditions on the use of medicinal plants, such as “Siete Colores”, “Chicalote” and “Árnica de Cerro”, which are widely used as analgesics, and antidiarrheal, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial remedies [

 <xref rid="B15-plants-10-00852" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. To our knowledge, no studies have been conducted to identify the bioactive secondary metabolites of these species or to evaluate their antifungal activity against the major pathogenic fungi of blueberries grown in the northwestern region of the state of Michoacán, Mexico.
