<p>The crude extracts that showed 100% antifungal activity in vitro were fractionated and evaluated. Nine of 10 fractions of the M5L extract of 
 <italic>L. hirta</italic> showed significant antifungal activity (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) compared to the negative control; the F10 fraction showed the highest percentages of inhibition (44.3%) against 
 <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic>. Few fractions had effect against 
 <italic>P. clavispora</italic>, as was the case of F6, with 11% inhibition (
