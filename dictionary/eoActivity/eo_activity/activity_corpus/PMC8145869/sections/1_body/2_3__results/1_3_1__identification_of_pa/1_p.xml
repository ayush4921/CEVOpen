<p>Three pathogens of blueberry were identified at the molecular level: 
 <italic>Pestalotiopsis clavispora</italic>, 
 <italic>Colletotrichum gloeosporioides</italic> and 
 <italic>Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae</italic>. The three fungi inoculated into blueberry plants caused dark-colored lesions on the stems, loosening of the epidermis and brown coloration of the leaf-tips (cancers and dieback disease). The fungi were reisolated and identified from the lesions they caused to the plants, fulfilling Kochâ€™s postulates.
