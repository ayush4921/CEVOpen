<p>The seventeen fractions from the M6LFr extract of 
 <italic>A. ochroleuca</italic> showed significant antifungal activity (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) against 
 <italic>P. clavispora</italic> and 
 <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic> compared to the negative control. Fractions F13 (36%) showed the highest inhibitory activity against
