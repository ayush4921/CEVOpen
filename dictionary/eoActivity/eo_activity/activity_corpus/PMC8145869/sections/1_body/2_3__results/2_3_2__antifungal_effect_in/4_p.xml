<p>Regarding the treatments with 
 <italic>A. porophyllum</italic>, the extract with the highest inhibitory activity was M4LS at a concentration of 5 mg/mL, inhibiting 100% of the growth of the three phytopathogens, the same result obtained with positive controls (

 <xref rid="plants-10-00852-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). M4LS also showed significant inhibition (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05) of 
 <italic>L. pseudotheobromae</italic> at concentrations of 1 and 2 mg/mL (78.7 and 82.7%, respectively). At a concentration of 5 mg/mL, the M2LS extract inhibited 100% of 
 <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic>, whereas at 2 mg/mL it inhibited only 18%, with significant differences compared to the negative control. The M7L extract (5 mg/mL) was not very effective against 
 <italic>P. clavispora</italic> and 
 <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic>. None of the extracts (
 <italic>L. hirta</italic>, 
 <italic>A. ochroleuca</italic> and 
 <italic>A. porophyllum</italic>) was effective against the mycelium of blueberry fungi at doses of 0.5 mg/mL (
