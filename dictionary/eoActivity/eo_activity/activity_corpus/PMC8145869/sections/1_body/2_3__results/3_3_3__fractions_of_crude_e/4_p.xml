<p>The M4LS extract of 
 <italic>A. porophyllum</italic> yielded eight fractions with significant antifungal activity (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) against the three fungi under study. The fractions with the highest percentage of inhibition were F2 (34.9%) against 
 <italic>P. clavispora</italic>, F4 (12.2%) against 
 <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic> and F5 (16.1%) against 
 <italic>L. pseudotheobromae</italic> (
