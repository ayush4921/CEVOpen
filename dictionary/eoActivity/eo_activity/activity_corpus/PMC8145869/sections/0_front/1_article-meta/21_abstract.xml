 <p>Three pathogenic fungi of blueberry (
  <italic>Vaccinium</italic> spp.) responsible for dieback disease, identified as 
  <italic>Pestalotiopsis clavispora</italic>, 
  <italic>Colletotrichum gloeosporioides</italic> and 
  <italic>Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae</italic>, were isolated in the northwestern region of the state of Michoacán, Mexico. The mycelial growth in vitro of these fungi was inhibited by extracts from 
  <italic>Lantana hirta</italic>, 
  <italic>Argemone ochroleuca</italic> and 
  <italic>Adenophyllum porophyllum</italic>, medicinal plants collected in Sahuayo, Michoacán, Mexico. The extracts showed different degrees of inhibition; the most effective were: M5L extract from 
  <italic>L. hirta</italic> and M6LFr extract from 
  <italic>A. ochroleuca</italic>, both of which inhibited 100% of the mycelial growth of 
  <italic>P. clavispora</italic> and 
  <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic>; and M4LS extract from 
  <italic>A. porophyllum</italic>, which inhibited 100% of the mycelial growth of the three pathogens. The extracts were fractionated by thin layer and column chromatography, and the most active fractions were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The major compounds identified in 
  <italic>L. hirta</italic> extract were Phytol and α-Sitosterol. The compounds identified in 
  <italic>A. ochroleuca</italic> were Toluene and Benzene, 1,3-bis(3-phenoxyphenoxy)-. In 
  <italic>A. porophyllum</italic>, the compound identified was Hexanedioic acid, bis(2-ethylhexyl) ester. These results show the potential of 
  <italic>L. hirta</italic>, 
  <italic>A. ochroleuca</italic> and 
  <italic>A. porophyllum</italic> as a source of antifungal compounds.
