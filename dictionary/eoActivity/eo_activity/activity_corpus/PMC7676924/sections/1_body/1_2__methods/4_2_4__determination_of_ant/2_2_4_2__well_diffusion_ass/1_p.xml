<p>Well diffusion assay for 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp. and 
 <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> spp. was conducted according to M44-A Standard [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Sabouraud's dextrose agar (SDA) media for yeast and potato dextrose agar were used for the subculturing of the A
 <italic>. flavus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Mueller-Hinton agar supplemented with 2% glucose and 0.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml methylene blue dye medium was used for testing of 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp. and 
 <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> spp. [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Nonsupplemented Mueller-Hinton agar was used for testing of the 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Fluconazole (0.25 mg/ml) was used as a positive control for 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp. and 
 <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> spp. [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Amphotericin B (0.1 mg/ml) was used as a positive control for 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. For the negative control, 1% DMSO was used [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. After the inoculation of the organisms, 8 mm wells were created and filled with 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of different concentrations of essential oil. Positive control (100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l) and negative control were also added [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. All the plates were prepared in triplicate and incubated at 35°C for 24 hours for 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp. and 48 hours for 
 <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> spp. At the end of the incubation period, the diameter of the zone of inhibition in each of the inoculated plates was measured and the diameter of the well was subtracted to determine the antifungal activities of the essential oil [
