<p>This is the first study to characterize EO composition and antimicrobial activity of the five medicinal species from Eastern Serbia against comprehensive literature data. This study demonstrated that 
 <italic>S. kitaibelii</italic> plants from Mt. Rtanj belonged to the 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene chemotype, 
 <italic>T. serpyllum</italic> plants belonged to the geraniol chemotype, while the 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> plants belonged to the germacrene D chemotype. The 
 <italic>A. millefolium</italic> were recorded as a multicomponent chemotype, while 
 <italic>A. clypeolata</italic> belonged to 1,8-cineole (45.1%) chemotype. Furthermore, the 
 <italic>S. kitaibelii</italic> EO was demonstrated to be a promising agent against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> bacterial strains. The chemical composition of studied EOs particularly focuses on the main EO constituents, which are assumed to be responsible for the observed antibacterial activity. Further investigations will be focused on studying major constituents of these EOs to evaluate concentrations of the components that could be responsible for the observed effect. Additional tests with larger numbers of bacteria regarding the synergic potential of EOs will be implemented in our future investigations.
