<p>Referring to the results of the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), the wells showing a complete absence of growth were identified and 100 µL of the solutions from each well were transferred to plate count agar plates (PCA) and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) was defined as the lowest concentration of the EOs at which 99.9% of the inoculated microorganisms were killed.</p>
