 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> described genetically distinct chemotypes that can be distinguished on the basis of the dominant monoterpene produced in the glandular trichomes. It was established that the monoterpene variations in 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> plants may represent an adaptive strategy in relation to the environmental variations, as the different chemotypes showed different geographic and locality distribution [
