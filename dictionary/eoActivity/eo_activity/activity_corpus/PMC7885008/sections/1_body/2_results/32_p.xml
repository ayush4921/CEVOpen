<p>In a study by Goodarzi et al., the methanolic extract of the roots was fractionated using hexane (HE), chloroform (CL), ethyl acetate (EA) and methanol (ME) respectively. To determine antioxidant activity of aerial parts EOs and various fractions of root extract, the DPPH and FRAP methods were used. Total root extract and EA fraction showed moderate free-radical scavenging activity. The antioxidant activity of root HE faction and all of aerial parts EO samples were poor as assessed by DPPH method (
