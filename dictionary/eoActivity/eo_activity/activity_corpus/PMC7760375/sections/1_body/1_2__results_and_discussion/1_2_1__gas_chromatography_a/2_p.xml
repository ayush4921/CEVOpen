<p>In the PS essential oil, 25 compounds were identified, which account for 92.47% of the total oil. The most abundant compound was hexahydrofarnesyl acetone (30.13%). A total of 21 compounds were identified in KS essential oil, representing 95.38% of the total oil, with the most abundant compound being hexadecanoic acid (37.31%). 
 <xref rid="plants-09-01646-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows that the number of compounds detected and identified in hydrosol was lower than in EO. This is logical since non-polar compounds are less soluble in water. In the PS hydrosol, we identified 17 compounds, representing 92.29% of the total hydrosol; in the KS hydrosol, we identified 16 compounds, representing 92.43% of the total hydrosol. In the hydrosol samples, the most abundant compound was 
 <italic>trans-p-</italic>mentha-1(7),8-dien-2-ol, which represented 31.75% and 36.63% of the total hydrosol in the PS and KS, respectively. These results are consistent with the fact that hydrosols contain dissolved molecules of EO, considering that more than half of the compounds that we identified in hydrosol can also be found in the essential oil [
