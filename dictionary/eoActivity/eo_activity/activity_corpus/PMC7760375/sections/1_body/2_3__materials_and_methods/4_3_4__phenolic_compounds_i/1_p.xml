<p>The phenolic compounds of the hydrosols were separated by high- performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a Series 200 Perkin Elmer HPLC system (Waltham, MA, USA), equipped with a thermostated autosampler, vacuum degasser, binary pump, thermostated column section, UV/VIS detector and the TotalChrom Workstation software package (version 6.2.1, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA) used for the analyses. Phenolic compounds were separated with the C18 column (Ultra-Aqueous C-18, 250 × 4.6 mm, 5 Å) (Restek, Bellefonte, PA, USA) and by gradient chromatography. Chromatography conditions were set according to the methodology by Jukic Spika et al. [
