<p>The antioxidant capacity of the extracts was assessed by the DPPH method previously described by Mensor et al. and Payet et al. [

This method is based on the reduction of alcoholic DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) solution (Sigma–Aldrich) in the presence of a hydrogen-donating antioxidant using 96-well microtiter plates. Plant extracts as described in the ORAC method were used (acetone-dissolved essential oils and absolute hydrosols). We pipetted 100 µL methanol (Kemika, Zagreb, Croatia) and 200 µL standard and/or sample into each well. We prepared serial dilutions of standard and samples by pipetting 100 µL from the first row with a multichannel pipette into the wells in the second row and so on to the last row, where 100 µL of the solution is ejected after mixing. In the first column, in 96-well plates, a blank sample was always added. For EOs, the acetone and methanolic solution were used as blank and for hydrosols, water and methanolic solution were used as blank. The reaction starts by adding 100 µL of a methanolic solution of DPPH (200 µM) to each well. The initial absorbance at 517 nm was measured immediately, using MetOH as blank value. After 60 min incubation, the absorbance was measured again and the percentage of DPPH inhibition was calculated according to the following formula by Yen and Duh [

 <disp-formula>% inhibition = ((AC(0) − AA(t))/AC(0)) × 100,</disp-formula> where AC(0) is the absorbance of the control at t = 0 min, and AA(t) is the absorbance of the antioxidant at t = 1 h. All measurements were performed in triplicate. The standard curve was generated by plotting the percentage of inhibition of standard with corresponding μmol of Trolox. From the standard curve, results for EOs were expressed as μmol of Trolox per g of EO and for hydrosols as μmol of Trolox per g of absolute hydrosol. Because of the data from other relevant literature we also expressed IC50 values for EOs expressed in mg/mL.
