<p>Genus 
 <italic>Veronica</italic> has been extensively phylogenetically investigated and the relationship between the distribution of iridoid glycosides and phylogeny has been reported [
 <xref rid="B6-plants-09-01646" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-plants-09-01646" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Flavonoid and phenolic compounds have also been extensively studied, probably because of their importance for the biological activity of plants. These compounds are known to have anti-allergenic, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, cardioprotective and vasodilator properties and, above all, antioxidant and radical scavenging potential [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-09-01646" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Species of the genus 
 <italic>Veronica</italic> are used in traditional medicine for the treatment of various diseases, including influenza, respiratory diseases and cancer, and as diuretics [
 <xref rid="B9-plants-09-01646" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] because of their natural richness in phenolic compounds and iridoids. In recent years, some research has shown that species from this genus could also be used to treat mental disorders [
 <xref rid="B10-plants-09-01646" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and some types of diabetes [
