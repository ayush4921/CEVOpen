<p>Moreover, EO from various sources such as oregano, basil, and rosemary from the mint family 
 <italic>Lamiaceae</italic>, as well as parsley, coriander, and anise in the family of 
 <italic>Apiaceae</italic> and cardamom from the 
 <italic>Zingiberaceae</italic> family showed considerable antimicrobial activity against saprophytic microbes [

 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium, Yersinia enterocolitica,</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> [
 <xref rid="B73-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. It was determined that oregano EO slowed the growth and lactic acid production of bacteria. Moreover, oregano EO when added to 
 <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> significantly inhibited its growth [

 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> with a Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of 63,000 Âµg/mL [
 <xref rid="B74-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Furthermore, cinnamon bark EO had been shown to cause oxidative stress to 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>, leading to the loss of cell viability [
 <xref rid="B75-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. The results mentioned above showed both oregano and cinnamon bark EO possess great antibacterial benefit; in addition, many studies have investigated their efficacies as antimicrobials against several species.
