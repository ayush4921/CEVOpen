<p>EO are hydrophobic in nature; thus, the hydrophobicity of the EO compounds causes an increase in the membrane permeability of bacteria, which may subsequently lead to the leakage of bacterial cell contents [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The leakage of the cell content includes ions such as potassium ion (K+) and hydrogen ion (H+), and also proteins and genetic material such as DNA (
