<p>A study that tested seven EO for their antimicrobial activity against resistant bacterial strains and fungi showed that oregano EO exhibited antibacterial activity against both 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> with the lowest MIC, which is 25 Âµg/mL, while other oils at higher concentrations were active against all microorganisms tested [
 <xref rid="B80-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. There were some EO that were more effective against Gram-positive bacteria while some were more effective against Gram-negative bacteria, and some EO were effective for both. 
 <italic>E. platyloba DC,</italic> oregano EO, as well as the compounds with phenolic properties such as hydrophobicity have been found to inhibit Gram-positive bacteria while lavender, oregano EO, and citronellol, carveol compounds can inhibit more Gram-negative bacteria. Both Gram-positive and negative bacteria have been affected by citral, eugenol, carvacrol, and thymol EO compounds.
