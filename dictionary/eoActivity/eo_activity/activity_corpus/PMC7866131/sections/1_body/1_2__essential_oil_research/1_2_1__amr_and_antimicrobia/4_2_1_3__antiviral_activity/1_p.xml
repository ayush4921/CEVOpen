The majority of effective antivirals against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) has become ineffective due to antiviral resistance, although they have contributed to combating viral infections; several antivirals have also induced adverse reactions. As a result, many studies have been done to explore new antiviral treatments to these viruses [

In addition to the limited effective antiviral medications, alternative therapeutic substances such as EO have been explored, as several trials have shown that EO can possess significant antiviral activity against many RNA and DNA viruses by inhibiting viral multiplication [
