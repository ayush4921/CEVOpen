<p>The efflux pump is a protein found in the plasma membrane of the bacteria, and its major function is to prevent the entrance of toxic compounds into the cytoplasm [

 <xref rid="B123-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. This protein plays an important role in antibacterial resistance that helps bacteria to survive. A major mechanism of antimicrobial resistance is increasing the expression of efflux pumps in bacteria, which will subsequently result in lowering the antibiotic concentration in bacterial cells [
 <xref rid="B65-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The efflux pump of bacteria works to protect the bacterial cell by pumping a large amount of antibiotics out of the cells [
