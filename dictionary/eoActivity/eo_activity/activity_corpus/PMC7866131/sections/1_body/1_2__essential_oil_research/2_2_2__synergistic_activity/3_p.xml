 <xref rid="B111-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. Tea tree oil has been shown to react synergistically with tobramycin against 
 <italic>E.coli</italic> ATCC 25922 and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 29213, with a mean post-antibiotic effect of 1.3 h against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 1.7 h against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B112-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. This study showed that this combinatory therapy is effective against the Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains. In addition, tea tree oil in combination with peppermint oil showed a synergistic activity against 
 <italic>A. niger</italic> with an FIC of 0.43 ± 0.06 [
 <xref rid="B110-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. Additional combinations of tea tree oil with different types of EO have been shown to give different synergistic and additive activities against fungal pathogens such as 
 <italic>Penicillium chrysogenum, A. flavus, Aspergillus parasiticus,</italic> and 
 <italic>A. niger</italic>. For instance, tea tree combined with cinnamon or eucalyptus showed additive activity in all fungal species with 0.5 ≤ FIC ≤ 1. If combined with thyme, the combination will give an additive activity with 0.5 ≤ FIC ≤ 1 against all species except 
 <italic>A. niger</italic>. Moreover, the combination of oregano and tea tree has been shown to be additive against both 
 <italic>P. chrysogenum</italic> and 
 <italic>A. niger</italic> [
