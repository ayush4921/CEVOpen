<p>The antifungal activity of multiple EO against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> has been studied. Plants such as oregano, rosemary, and thymus showed a strong inhibitory effect with an MIC result ranging from 15.02 to 31.08 µg/mL [

 <xref rid="B88-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Additionally, different 
 <italic>Ocimum</italic> EO species have been tested against different 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species, and their antifungal activity by the broth microdilution method have shown that 
 <italic>Ocimum micranthum</italic> and 
 <italic>Ocimum selloi</italic> are active against 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species with MIC values of 312.5–1250 μg/mL [
 <xref rid="B89-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Therefore, 
 <italic>Ocimum</italic> EO can be used to treat infection with fungus such as 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> [
 <xref rid="B89-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Due to an abundance of the phenolic constituents including carvacrol and thymol as major components in oregano and thyme, EO have shown significant inhibitory activity against fungal pathogens by breaking the fungal cell membrane [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In general, oregano has been found to affect both spore germination and destroy fungal cell membranes. In addition, it has been determined that the mycelial growth of three fungal 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> species was inhibited by 90–100% due to the activity of cinnamon and clove EO [
 <xref rid="B90-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. A study has reported the fungicidal potentials of EO and pure constituents to hamper viable cell count, mycelia growth, and mycotoxin production by these fungi after treatment with clove, cinnamon, and oregano EO [
