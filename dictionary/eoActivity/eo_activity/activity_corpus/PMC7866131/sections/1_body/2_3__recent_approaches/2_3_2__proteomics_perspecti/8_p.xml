<p>Furthermore, NMR instruments allow the molecular structure of a material to be analyzed by observing and measuring the interaction of nuclear spins under a powerful magnetic field. The method allows cellular components to be easily examined and recognized from their characteristic chemical shifts. In general, intra and extra-cellular metabolomic studies using the methods mentioned in this section have some basic benefits such as the provision of important functional genomics, characterization of the strains, their metabolic engineering, and ways of cellular communications [
