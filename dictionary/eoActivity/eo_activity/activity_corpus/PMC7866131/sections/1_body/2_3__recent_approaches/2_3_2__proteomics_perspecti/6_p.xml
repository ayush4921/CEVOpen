<p>Other powerful and precise analytical tools that are used for the assessment of the bacterial metabolome include gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and microarray. LC-MS/MS is a technique used for the quantification of proteins that is highly selective and sensitive [
