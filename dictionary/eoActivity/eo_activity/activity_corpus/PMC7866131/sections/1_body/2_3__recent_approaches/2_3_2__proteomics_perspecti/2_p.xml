<p>Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) is known as the most used technique for separating and identifying proteins as it is able to evaluate thousands of different spots in a protein mixture [
 <xref rid="B139-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. It consisted of the isoelectric focusing (IEF) method in the first dimension, which separates the proteins according to the isoelectric focusing, and in the second dimension, separation is performed based on the molecular size by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS- PAGE) [

The basic principle of these techniques is to separate the complex protein mixture into two steps by placing the mixture in a gel and applying an electrical current. This technique is widely used in proteome analysis, bacterial pathogenesis, diseases research, and the purification of proteins [
