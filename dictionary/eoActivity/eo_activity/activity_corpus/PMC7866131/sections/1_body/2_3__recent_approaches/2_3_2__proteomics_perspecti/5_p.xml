<p>To identify the mechanism of action of thymol EO, 2D-PAGE followed by MALDI-TOF methods was employed to analyze the protein profile in order to detect the induced stress reaction caused by exposing 
 <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Thompson to sublethal concentration (0.01%). The study demonstrated that different significant effects occurred including proteins alteration, increase, and reduction. Proteins such as GroEL and DnaK were overexpressed in the treated cells as a reaction due to treatment by EO. However, the thioredoxin-1 protein was downregulated due to thymol action. In conclusion, utilizing proteomics approaches to observe the effects was helpful to provide evidence of thymol bactericidal ability and show its particular targets [
