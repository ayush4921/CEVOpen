<p>EO reactivity depends on their functional groups; they can increase permeability of the pathogen cell membrane and cause the leaking of intracellular components, which negatively affects the cell metabolism [

 <xref rid="B155-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>]. Moreover, EO are important for reducing the antimicrobial resistance; more effort is needed to do long-term studies to determine the EO effectiveness in vivo by conducting clinical trials in order to discover its full potential, the needed dose, and determine if any side effects emerge [

Previous discoveries of EO against antimicrobials still did not explain exactly the EO mechanism of action and their chemical nature, and this makes the effectiveness and action of EO against antimicrobials unclear and in need of improvement [
