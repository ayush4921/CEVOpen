<p>Some researchers suggested that the antibacterial effect of EO should be checked in the lag phase of bacterial growth, which will help researchers understand the mechanisms and pathways involved in the development of EO as potential antimicrobial agents [

Nevertheless, with the emerging concept of green consumerism, it is expected that the use of EO and medicinal plants will increase, and further exploration will occur. The use of natural products-based drugs, nutraceuticals, herbs, and isolated pure compounds is tremendously increased in medicine, the food sector, cosmetics, and didactics. The use of modern analytical techniques can help mankind in the further development of evidence-based medicine with more efficacy and safety. Thus, new nanoencapsulation strategies and synergistic studies can help provide powerful information about this topic of interest in future [
