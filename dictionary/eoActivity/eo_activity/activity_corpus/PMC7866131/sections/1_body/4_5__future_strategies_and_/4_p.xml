<p>Despite the fact that genomic technologies have provided us with tremendous opportunities to understand the biological drug targets, the problem of microbial-mediated infections is still a global health challenge. This is mainly due to the emergence of resistant genes and the indiscriminate use of antimicrobial agents. Another reason is that the pharmaceutical industries are in a rush to develop more drugs and are only getting derivatives of the original drugs. The discovery of novel compounds with new mechanisms of action is very limited. Thus, for the development of more effective therapeutic agents, experts from various disciplines are needed; these include genomics, structural biology, genetics, and bioinformatics. Moreover, the establishment of widespread epidemiological networks capable of reporting the emergence of new microbes and public awareness is imperative for effective mitigation.</p>
