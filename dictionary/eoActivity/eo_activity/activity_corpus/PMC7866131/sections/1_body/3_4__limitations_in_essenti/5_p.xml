<p>Although a plethora of EO are available, only a few have obtained approval as preservatives in food. This is because certain food components drastically reduce the antimicrobial efficiency of EO. Consequently, the development of more effective and validated food model systems that have close resemblance with food components is desirable. This will predict the effect of food on the antimicrobial potentials of EO and will help in the optimization of EO as food preservatives. Subsequently, it is very important to evaluate the antimicrobial mechanisms of various food combinations with EO for optimized and reliable use of these oils as preservatives. As discussed earlier, the combination of various secondary metabolites is sometimes required for the adequate antimicrobial efficacy of EO. Some studies have reported that crude extracts and crude oils display a better antimicrobial spectrum when compared with pure compounds [
