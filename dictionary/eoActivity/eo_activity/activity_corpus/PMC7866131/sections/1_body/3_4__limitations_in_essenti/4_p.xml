<p>Stability is another issue associated with the use of EO due to their heat-labile nature. EO are generally volatile at normal temperature and need to be stored in cool and dry environments. Exposure to elevated temperatures and humidity might cause their decomposition and hence efficacy as antimicrobial agents to be reduced. For instance, cinnamaldehyde was reported to be degraded at elevated temperatures and form benzaldehyde at 60
 <sup>◦</sup>C, but when combined with eugenol or cinnamon leaf oil, it is stable even at high temperatures (200 °C for 30 min). More recently, encapsulation tools were reported to significantly improve stability issues and reduce excessive oxidation, loss of quantity, change in aroma, and interactions with other chemicals [
