<p>Despite the fact that EO are highly useful alternative antimicrobial agents, especially against food-borne microbes, there is a considerable lack of information regarding their toxicity profiles. Moreover, the likelihood of EO effect on the stress tolerance of microbes is limited. Though generally regarded as safe, natural products and EO are not completely safe due to the diversity of metabolites in them when used as antimicrobial agents [

Thus, there is a need to optimize the analysis of a range of EO and compounds more clearly for the effective yet safe use of EO for human beings. The formation of residues in biological systems and allergic reactions associated with the use of EO are also among other challenges regarding their use as antimicrobial agents [
