<p>The variation in results might be due to disparity in EO, level of various impurities in samples, type of microbes, and experimental conditions. Furthermore, various studies have indicated slightly variable definitions of MIC and Minimum Bactericidal Concentrations (MBCs). The main issue is that EO may not be easily tested by routine techniques such as disc diffusion and MICs may not be easily tested in the traditional way that powdered materials are tested, because EO undergo volatile evaporation from the discs may provide inaccurate results. Consequently, there is a great variation in results and reproducibility of the results, and it is often very difficult to draw useful and applied results from various research studies.</p>
