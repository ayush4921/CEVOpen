<p>Although extensive studies have been conducted to explore the antimicrobial potential of EO, the results of several studies are not entirely in agreement in terms of the EO efficiency killing microbes or mitigating their stability at various environmental conditions, such as in the presence of salts. There are also limited studies on the relationship between the structure of EO compounds correlated to antimicrobial activity [
