<p>Bacterial resistance to antibiotics can either be inherited or acquired via resistant genes [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Vertical gene transfer occurs from a parent cell while horizontal gene transfer of plasmids is acquired from other cells; the acquisition can also be due to a spontaneous recombination [

 <xref rid="B15-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Due to the acquisition of these genes, bacteria are able to produce enzymes such as Î²-lactamase, carbapenemase, and nucleotidyltransferase (NTase) that act against the antibiotics, on the efflux pump on the bacterial cell membrane, or change the original target site of the antibiotic [

 <italic>Candida</italic>, an opportunistic yeast, can develop resistance to drugs when an antibacterial drug is consumed by the host. Despite the drug not being targeted to 
 <italic>Candida</italic>, prolonged exposure can introduce 
 <italic>Candida</italic> resistance to the drug [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Both 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> and 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species have shown resistance to antifungal drugs such as azole and fluconazole, which can be used to treat systemic fungal infections by inhibiting its growth [

 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Viruses have also shown antiviral resistance; for example, influenza virus has shown resistance against Oseltamivir, Amantadine, and Rimantadine. Resistance to Acyclovir by herpes simplex virus (HSV) has been detected in different countries [
