<p>Antimicrobial substances are secreted naturally in the microbial ecosystem as a survival mechanism. Antimicrobial-producing microorganisms, in order to avoid self-toxicity, commonly develop resistance genes to protect themselves from their own antimicrobials [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], while microorganisms faced with antimicrobials develop their own resistance in the process. This very same scenario is now replayed in the clinical setting whereby the application of antibiotics has caused the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Some factors such as the inappropriate and incorrect prescription of antibiotics, their overuse in clinics and animal husbandry, in addition to poor sanitation of water in developing countries have exacerbated the phenomenon of antibiotic resistance [
