<p>The antioxidant activity of different oil batches was determined by the DPPH method [

Briefly, 0.5 mL of the rosemary’s volatile oils, in a concentration ranging from 5 to 0.0312 mg, was added to 1.5 mL of a DPPH–methanol solution at a concentration of 100 µM (quercetin was used as a standard in the same concentration [
