<p>The dose-dependent DPPH reactivity changes are noteworthy and were concluded based on the enhanced presence of particular constituents after the analysis of the componential ratios in different batches of oils (

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) of the two- and three-weeks dried herbsâ€™ oils, and the reactivity at equal levels at lower concentrations of 0.0312 and 0.625 mg/mL for the fresh and one-week dried herbs-based oils, respectively, can be attributed to the presence of structurally-similar constituents or common chemical class compounds, although the synergistic action of other constituents and other chemical class compounds cannot be ruled out. Moreover, the abundance of terpenoids with hydrocarbons and C, C-double bonds (C=C) is one apparent reason for the significant higher DPPH-reactivity of the two- and three-weeks dried herbs-based oils, as reflected in the presence of the oil constituents and compositions. The three-week dried herb oil also contained various terpenic constituents of alcoholic, ketonic, and aldehyde nature in reduced proportions in comparison to all the other oils. The fresh and one-week dried herbs-based oils also contained this category of hydrocarbons, terpenes, and C=C containing compounds as oil constituents at 44.5% and 48%, respectively. It is noteworthy that hydrocarbons and C,C-double bond (C=C) constituents are more susceptible to DPPH reactivity [
