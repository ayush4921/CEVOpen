<p>The initial drying is an essential process for medicinal plants for fixating and preserving their constituents [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-02830" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The natural drying processes refer to plant materials drying by sunlight or in the shade under existing environmental conditions [

 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-02830" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The effects of various drying methodologies over volatile oil yields are an ostensibly common phenomenon. For instance, for fresh herbs and their microwave-drying, vacuum oven-drying, hot air drying, and freeze-drying, affect oil yields, the number of constituents, and quality, and they have shown substantial differences among the contents in up and down trends of yields in various drying procedures [

The present study adds information about the natural drying of the herbs, as practiced in herbalist drying protocol, and at homes before fresh rosemary herb’s storage for prolonged use or for the extraction of the oil for various medicinal and culinary uses. This study investigated drying and extended drying periods’ effects on oil yields and oil’s constituents, together with their compositional ratios in the oil. The study also analyzed the antioxidant property of the oil as an indicator of its quality.
