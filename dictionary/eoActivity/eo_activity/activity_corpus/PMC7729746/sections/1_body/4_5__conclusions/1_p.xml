<p>This study shows new interesting knowledge about EOs extracted using hydrodistillation in Clevenger apparatus 
 <italic>Cryptocarya alba</italic> and 
 <italic>Laurelia sempervirens</italic>. The chemical composition analyzed by GC-MS allowed us to determine the major components present in each species, which could be responsible for the biological activity they present, in future studies the activity of each one of them could be studied. Both EOs showed antimicrobial activity in different concentrations to different bacteria. Due to great antibacterial activity, along with the composition of EOs, we see a great potential for future usages of these oils, such as natural antimicrobials or food preservatives. Additional studies, including pharmacological, toxicological, and clinical aspects and formulation of these compounds, will be required to understand the role of some components of CA and LS_EOs to demonstrate the remarkable efficacy and safety of these EOs as antimicrobial agents. The CA and LS_EOs have important bioactive potential, cytotoxicity and toxicity, which would allow their use of active ingredients in fields such as the clinical, nutrition, cosmetics, sanitation and plaguicides, among others.
