 <xref rid="B8-molecules-25-05600" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] has evaluated the fungistatic activity of EO extracted from CA_EO and LS_EO against fungi such as 
 <italic>Rhizoctonia solani</italic> Kühn (Donk) and 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> Schltdl. Additionally, Avello [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-25-05600" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] evaluated the antifungal activity of EOs extracted from canelo, queule, bailahuén and culen against other phytopathogenic fungi, such as 
 <italic>Botritys cinerea</italic>, 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> and 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic>. Additionally, we have identified the major active compounds as well as evaluated the effects of the CA_EO against 
 <italic>N. ceranae</italic> and its potential use for the control of nosemosis disease [
