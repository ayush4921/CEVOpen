<p>The agar disk diffusion technique has been widely used to assay plant extracts for antimicrobial activity. In this method, 6 mm sterilized filter paper disks (Whatman
 <sup>®</sup> No 1) were saturated with 10 μL of filter-sterilized oil plant extract. The impregnated discs were then placed onto the surface of a suitable solid agar medium, such as Mueller Hinton BD
 <sup>®</sup>. The media was pre-inoculated with test organisms. A standard inoculum size of 1 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL of bacteria was used to inoculate the diffusion plates, which is equal to the McFarland 0.5 turbidity standard. The plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C, and the diameter of the inhibition zone around each disk (diameter of inhibition zone plus diameter of the disk) was measured in millimeters. A Sensydisc was used as a positive control for Gram+ and Gram− strains Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) [
