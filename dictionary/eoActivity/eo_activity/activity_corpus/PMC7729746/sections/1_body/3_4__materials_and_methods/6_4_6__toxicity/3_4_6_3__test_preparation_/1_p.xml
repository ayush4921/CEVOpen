<p>The CA and LS essential oils were prepared at concentrations of 0.39, 0.78, 1.56, 3.12, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 50.0 mg/mL and placed in a final volume of 100 µL in 96-well plates. The control assays were performed with M9 and 1% DMSO Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Ten individuals of 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic>/well were used in each trial. The plates were incubated (incubator Binder KT) at 20 °C for 24 and 48 h. The experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated twice. After incubation at 20 °C, all the nematodes were counted at 24 and 48 h to determine their survival. They were considered alive if they showed some type of motility and were considered dead when they showed no movement, either from their tail, head or pharynx, after 5 s of observation (Stereo Microscope Leica MZ12). The count was performed to establish the degree of mortality [
