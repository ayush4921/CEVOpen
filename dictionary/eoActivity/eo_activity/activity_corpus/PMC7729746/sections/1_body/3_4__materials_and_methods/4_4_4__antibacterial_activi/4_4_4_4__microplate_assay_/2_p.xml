ELISA (Tecan) readings at 600 nm were recorded to calculate the MIC values as described by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [

To identify significant differences between treated and untreated groups, data comparison by the ANOVA test was performed using the GraphPad Prism 5 program.
