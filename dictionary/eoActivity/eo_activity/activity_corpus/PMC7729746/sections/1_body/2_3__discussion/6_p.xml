<p>Total antioxidant activities of the EOs cannot be evaluated by any single method due to the complex nature of phytochemical composition [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-25-05600" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Two or more methods should always be employed in order to evaluate the total antioxidative effects. In this sense, the CA_EO, showed a higher antioxidant activity, compared to that of LS_EO obtained with FRAP, DPPH or ABTS methods [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-05600" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This may be due in part to the complexity of the chemical composition. The antioxidant activity shown by CA_EO can be explained by its greater composition in terpenes with their conjugated hexadiene structure (35% of its composition), in comparison to the content of 14% of compounds with the same carbon nucleus for the LS_EO. It has been shown that the compounds present in the CA_EO such as d-phellandrene (0.71%), β-phellandrene (14.84%) γ-terpinene (2.67%), α-terpinene (24.96%) and limonene (3.41%), act through a mechanism of autooxidation, trapping free radicals efficiently [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-25-05600" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This higher antioxidant activity is also due to the fact that the CA_EO has in its composition hydroxylated terpenes such as β-eudesmol (1.49%), 4-terpineol (1.72%) and the second major component α-terpineol (24.29%). On the other hand, the LS_EO does not present hydroxylated terpenes and only 5.3% of limonene. Although phenolic aromatic compounds were not identified in both oils, there are reports of other EOs whose absence of this type of compound has presented a higher antioxidant capacity comparable to the synthetic antioxidant BHT [
