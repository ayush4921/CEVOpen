<p>The sample compositions obtained by HD using the Clevenger-type apparatus (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05600-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) indicated that the CA_EO contained 14 compounds, while the LS_EO contained 6 compounds. The highest yielding compounds in CA_EO were α-terpineol (24.96%), eucalyptol (21.63%), and β-phellandrene (14.84%) and the highest yielding compounds in LS were isazafrol (91.9%), limonene (5.3%), and O-cimene (1.3%).
