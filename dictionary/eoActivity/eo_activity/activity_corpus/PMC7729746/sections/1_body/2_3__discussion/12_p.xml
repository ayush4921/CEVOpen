<p>The CA_ EO showed low or no toxicity against 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05600-f006">Figure 6</xref>) but the LS_ EO showed toxicity in all the concentrations evaluated with 100% mortality both at 24 and 48 h. The CA_EO was toxic at 24 h at 50% with 100% mortality at 48 h. At 6.25 mg/mL, however, it showed toxicity at 48 h with 55% mortality. Although some level of toxicity was observed, it was only at the highest concentrations, higher than those recommended for studies in 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> (1 mg/mL) of the authors [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-05600" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This demonstrates that CA_EO has low or no toxicity as opposed to the high toxicity of LS_EO.
