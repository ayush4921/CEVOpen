<p>In order to evaluate the selective cytotoxicity and the antitumoral activity of the EOs, mammary tumor cell line MCF-7 and the non-tumor cell line MCF10A, were incubated with CA_EO and LS_EO at different concentrations and a proliferation CV assay was performed [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-05600" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. CA_EO and LS_EO significantly inhibited the proliferation of mammary tumor MCF-7 cells at 64 and 32 ug/mL concentrations, being more evident with CA_EO. Conversely, in the MCF10A non-tumoral cells no significant differences were found among the treatments, irrespective of the concentration (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05600-f002">Figure 2</xref>). We found that the MCF-7 epithelial cells showed an inhibited proliferation when treated with CA_EO at different concentrations (64 to 16 ug/mL). Minor concentrations of 8 ug/mL did not show any effects (

The human epithelial renal cells (HK-2, 786-O and ACHN) were exposed to the EOs and a dose-response curve was performed. In contrast to the effect observed in non-tumoral mammary cells, the CA_EO showed an inhibitory effect on proliferation of non-tumor renal cell HK-2 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05600-f003">Figure 3</xref>d). Regarding the primary tumor (786-O) and metastatic site (ACHN) renal cell lines, treatment with both EOs demonstrated a significant inhibition on cell viability and proliferation (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05600-f003">Figure 3</xref>d–e respectively). The CA and LS EOs demonstrated a significant inhibition on cell viability and proliferation at 64 ug/mL in human glioblastoma cells tumor cell line U87MG and human fibroblast cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05600-f004">Figure 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05600-f005">Figure 5</xref>, respectively). The LS_ EO showed a greater inhibitory effect on these cell lines compared to CA_EO. This could be attributed to the presence of limonene which has been previously described for its antitumoral potential, inhibited the growth of lung cancer cells and suppressed the growth of transplanted tumors in nude mice [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-05600" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Limonene exerted its effects by up-regulation of BAX, cytochrome c release, caspase-3, caspase-9, TGF-β, and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-05600" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. On the other hand, POH also up-regulates Bak, caspase-3, FasL, TGF-β, c-fos, and c-Jun as well as blocks extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2 phosphorylation pathway [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-05600" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-05600" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Furthermore, both limonene and POH could possibly inhibit tumor progression through down-regulation of basal production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in cancer cells [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-05600" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Additionally, they also suppressed the mevalonate pathway as well as isoprenylation of small G proteins leading to tumor regression [
