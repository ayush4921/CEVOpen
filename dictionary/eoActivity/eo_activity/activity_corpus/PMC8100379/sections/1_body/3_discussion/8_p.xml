<p>The main constituents of yarrow oil are mainly sesquiterpenes such as germacrene D (26.15%), chamazulene (10.04%) and β-caryophyllene (10.35%) and some monoterpenes such as sabinene (14.28%), β-pinene (11.40%) and borneol (5.26%) and this is in accordance with the essential oil composition reported elsewhere [

 <xref rid="b12-ir-2020-00021" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The oil is blue in color due to the presence of chamazulene which is known for its anti-inflammatory activity and many studies attributed the anti-inflammatory activity of yarrow and chamomile essential oils to their high concentrations of chamazulene [
