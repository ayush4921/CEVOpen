<p>The study, hereby, showed that the yarrow oil could suppress DSS-induced colitis in mice model and improve colonic injury. Furthermore, treatment with yarrow oil could inhibit pro-inflammatory responses, indicating that the yarrow oil may have a potent anti-inflammatory effect on UC, which was evinced by the normalization of the DAI score. Notably, treatment with yarrow oil reduced losses of crypts, edema, and mucosal erosions in the mucosa determined by the histopathological analysis. In colitis induced by DSS in mice, an increase in colonic infiltration of T-cells, macrophages and neutrophils is usually observed [
