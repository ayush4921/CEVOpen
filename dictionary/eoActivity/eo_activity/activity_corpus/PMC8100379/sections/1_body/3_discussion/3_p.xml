<p>Yarrow oil showed the ability to suppress UC, so we tried to investigate the potential mechanisms that might explain this therapeutic effect. Although, the exact mechanism of UC is still partly unknown, the NF-κB signaling pathway has been far believed to be able to mediate and maintain remission in UC [

NF-κB is able to mediate pro-inflammatory responses by up-regulating the infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages [
 <xref rid="b21-ir-2020-00021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Our results show that treatment with the yarrow oil significantly induced a significant increase in the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, and decreased level of inflammatory cytokine, IL-6, in the same time decreased expression of NF-κB and its signal target gene TNF-α. Most likely, the regulation of NF-κB is a key component of the anti-inflammatory activity of yarrow oil.
