<p>The anti-inflammatory effects of the yarrow oil constituents that have been reported showed their effect on a variety of signaling pathways or their key element mediators. Moreover, some articles showed multiple mechanisms for the anti-inflammatory effect of the same constituent. Collectively this enhances our finding that the yarrow oil exerts a powerful anti-inflammatory effect in a synergistic and intricate manner through reduction of NF-κB production in the DSS-induced colitis and its target TNF-α gene, and enhancement of the expression of PPAR-γ which suppresses the expression of several inflammatory mediators.</p>
