<p>The anti-inflammatory effects of most of these components have been reported individually. For instance, both β-caryophyllene and germacrene D reduces the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ in lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-stimulated cells [
 <xref rid="b46-ir-2020-00021" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Chamazulene attenuates levels of reactive oxygen species in endothelial cells and protects from the vascular damage [
 <xref rid="b47-ir-2020-00021" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. 1,8-Cineole ameliorates the GI inflammation and ulceration via reduction of myeloperoxidase activity and repletion of glutathione [
 <xref rid="b48-ir-2020-00021" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Another study indicated that 1,8-cineole could be useful in long term treatment of airway inflammation in bronchial asthma through reduction of TNF-α production [
 <xref rid="b49-ir-2020-00021" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Sabinene inhibits the nitric oxide (NO) production [
 <xref rid="b50-ir-2020-00021" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Borneol reduces the level of inflammatory factors including NO, TNF-α and IL-6 in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophages [
 <xref rid="b51-ir-2020-00021" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Borneol improves the efficacy of edaravone against DSS-induced colitis by promoting M2 macrophages polarization via the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway [
 <xref rid="b52-ir-2020-00021" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. α-Humulene inhibits the TNF-α and IL-1β generation in carrageenan-injected rats, furthermore, reduces the production of prostaglandin E-2, inducible NO synthase and COX-2 expression [
 <xref rid="b53-ir-2020-00021" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. As for our knowledge, we are the first to study the potential effect of yarrow oil to ameliorate the DSS-induced inflammation in mice model.
