<p>TGF-β regulates mucosal immune reactions via the TGF-β signaling pathway. This pathway is impaired in the colons of IBD patients. Dysregulated signal pathway of TGF-β in the T-cells and dendritic cells causes spontaneous colitis in the mouse model [

A variety of cells including, macrophages, T helper (Th), and regulatory T cells, play a critical role by suppression or enhancement of inflammation. Signaling pathways of cytokines are important in the inflammation process where pro-inflammatory cytokines as TNF-α and IL-6 play an important role in upregulation, while anti-inflammatory cytokines as TGF-β and IL-10 play the opposite role in the downregulation of inflammation [
