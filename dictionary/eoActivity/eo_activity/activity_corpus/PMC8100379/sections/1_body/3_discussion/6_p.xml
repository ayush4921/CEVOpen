<p>There are 2 pathways for T helper 17 (Th17) differentiation have been reported; TGF-β dependent and independent pathway, however, the explanation of the 2 pathways remains controversial [
 <xref rid="b35-ir-2020-00021" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Most of the studies reported that T cell differentiation is TGF-β (family) dependent pathway in concert with IL-6 or IL-21 which differentiate naïve T-cells into Th17 cells, through inducing nuclear receptor retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor gamma (ROR-γt) expression [

 <xref rid="b36-ir-2020-00021" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, some studies reported that Th17 differentiation can be done through TGF-β independent pathway. Jones et al [
 <xref rid="b37-ir-2020-00021" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. reported that IL-6-mediates Th17 subset maturation and attributed it to the role of STAT3 also Li et al. [
 <xref rid="b38-ir-2020-00021" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] proposed that IL-6 promotes T cell proliferation due to low-level expression of the ROR-γt transcription factor under inflammatory conditions only. In our study, yarrow oil treatment boosted TGF-β expression in the colonic tissue during the acute phase of colitis. TGF-β is important for intestinal mucosal immunity via T cell development, homeostasis, and differentiation perhaps with other signaling pathways.
