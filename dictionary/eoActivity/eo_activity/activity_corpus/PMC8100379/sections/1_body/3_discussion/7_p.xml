<p>In contrast, PPAR-γ is highly expressed in colonic epithelial cells and to a lesser extent in macrophages and lymphocytes and the protein expression in the colon is closely linked to intestinal-microbial interaction [

 <xref rid="b39-ir-2020-00021" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This impaired expression is found in both inflamed and non-inflamed parts of the colon and limited only to epithelial cells. This notice suggests that the modified expression is not secondary to the inflammatory process [

 <xref rid="b41-ir-2020-00021" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Recently, PPAR-γ has been reported to play an important role in the immune response via its ability to suppress the expression of a lot of the inflammatory cytokines [
