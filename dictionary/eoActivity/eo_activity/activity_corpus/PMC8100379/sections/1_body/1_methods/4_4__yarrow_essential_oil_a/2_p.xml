<p>Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry data were performed on GCMS-QP2010 Plus (Shimadzu Corp.). The ionization energy for the mass spectrometer was 70 eV. The other conditions were identical to those mentioned for gas chromatography/flame ionization. Kovats retention indices were calculated with respect to a set of co-injected standard hydrocarbons (C10-C28; Sigma Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany). Compounds were identified by comparing their spectral data and retention indices with Wiley Registry of Mass Spectral Data 10th edition (April 2013), NIST 11 Mass Spectral Library (NIST11/2011/EPA/NIH) and literature data [
