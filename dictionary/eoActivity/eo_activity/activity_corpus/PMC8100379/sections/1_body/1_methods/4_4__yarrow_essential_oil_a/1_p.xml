<p>The isolated yarrow essential oil was subjected to gas chromatography analysis. Gas chromatography/flame ionization analysis was accomplished using GC-2010 Plus (Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan) gas chromatograph outfitted with FID-2010 Plus detector. The column was RTX-5MS
 <sup>®</sup> fused silica capillary (30 m × 0.25 mm inner diameter and 0.25 μm film thickness); the oven temperature initially was held at 40°C for 1 minute and then increased to 240°C at 3°C/min. The carrier gas was helium with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min; the temperature of injector and detector were 250°C and 300°C, respectively, the split ratio was 1:20 and the injection volume is 5 μL. Quantification of essential oil components was performed by relative parentage area calculations. The relative percentage of the essential oil constituents was assessed on basis of the FID responses from the total peak area using percentage area normalization [
