<p>Mice were divided into 3 groups, 7 mice in each group; healthy control group (control), which were given tap water, UC induced-group (DSS), which received 5% DSS freshly prepared in drinking water (DSS), and yarrow oil-treated group (oil), received 100 mg/kg of oil diluted with water. The oil was given once daily via gavage concomitant with the DSS-treatment period. The control group continued on tap water for drinking while both of DSS-group and oil-group were given 5% DSS in the drinking water for 9 days [

The key point in preparing the model is the monitoring signs of developing colitis by measuring the miceâ€™s body weight and occult blood in the feces. Moreover, to prepare chronic colitis low concentration of DSS is used for a long time as we used in our previous publication [
