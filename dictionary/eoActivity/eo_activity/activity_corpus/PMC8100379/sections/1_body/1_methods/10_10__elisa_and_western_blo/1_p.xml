<p>IL-6 and IL-10 were determined in serum using the kits described under the chemical and reagent section and according to manufacturer protocols. NF‐κB, PPAR-γ, TNF-α, TGF-β, and GAPDH expression were determined in colon homogenates by Western blot analysis. The blot analysis was performed as previously described [
 <xref rid="b21-ir-2020-00021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Briefly, colon samples were homogenized in radio immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer with a protease inhibitor; the total protein extracted from those homogenates was quantified using a NanoDrop Lite spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Then, 50 μg of the total extracted protein was separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and blotted on PVDF membranes. The membranes were incubated with the primary antibodies (1:300 dilutions) for 2 hours at room temperature, and they were then incubated with the secondary antibody (goat antirabbit HRP-conjugated at a 1:5,000 dilution). The chemiluminescence produced from the luminol reagent was detected with the LI-COR C-DiGit chemiluminescence scanner (Lincoln, NE, USA) and the intensity of the bands was analyzed using the scanner software. β-Actin was used as a protein loading control.
