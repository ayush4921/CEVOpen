<p>A preliminary study was done (results not shown) to investigate the therapeutic and toxic doses from yarrow oil on experimental mice, using concentration from 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 to 500 mg/kg. These preliminary studies are common practice before working with essential oil to determine the dose and to determine the toxicity. The least dose produced a therapeutic effect was 100 mg/kg. For toxicity studies, we treated normal control mice by doses of oil from 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1,000 mg/kg and no symptoms of toxicity were noticed. We used water as a vehicle since the oil is miscible with water.</p>
