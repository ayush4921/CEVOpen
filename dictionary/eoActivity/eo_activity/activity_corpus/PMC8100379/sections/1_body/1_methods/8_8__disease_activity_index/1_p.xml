<p>Colitis was assessed using the disease activity index (DAI) as described in [
 <xref rid="b25-ir-2020-00021" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In brief, bodyweight loss, bleeding, and stool consistency were scored. Weight loss of 0, 1–5, 5–10, 10–20, and &gt; 20% were scored as 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. For stool consistency, 0 was scored for normal well-formed particles, 1 for loose stools, 2 for semi-formed stools, 3 for liquid stools, and 4 for diarrhea. Bleeding was scored 0 for no blood, 1 for trace, 2 for mild hemoccult, 3 for obvious hemoccult, and 4 for gross bleeding. The calculated sub-scores were summed and the total was divided by 3 to obtain the DAI scores, which ranges from 0 to 4.
