<p>Mice were treated as described in the experimental part to prepare the colitis model and the disease was manifested through the decrease of body weight, stool uniformity in addition to bleeding symptoms. The loss of body weight and unformed stool has been noticed from the 5th day and became obvious on the 9th day in the DSS-group. On the other hand, unformed stool in the oil-treated group was noticed on the 8th day. DSS-induced colitis group showed significantly higher DAI score compared to the control group (3.62 ± 0.037 vs. 0.35 ± 0.06,
