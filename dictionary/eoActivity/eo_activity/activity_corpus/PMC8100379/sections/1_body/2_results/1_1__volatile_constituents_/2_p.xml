<p>For the 19 components, 14 are monoterpenes and 5 are sesquiterpenes, however, those 5 sesquiterpenes represent 50.93% of the total area percentage of the whole oil components. Germacrene D (26.15%), chamazulene (10.04%), and β-caryophyllene (10.35%), were quantified as the major sesquiterpene in the essential oil. In addition to sabinene (14.28%), β‐pinene (11.40%), and borneol (5.26%) were the major monoterpenes. 15.66% (7 compounds) of the essential oil components were oxygenated and nearly 50% (7.81%) of the oxygenated compound were alcohols, and the most abundant alcohol was borneol (5.26%). Yarrow essential oil contains many cyclization patterns, with the majority of compounds being bicyclic (10 compounds, 56.40%) and then monocyclic (7compounds, 32.31%). Two com-pounds, o-cymene (0.66%) and chamazulene (10.04%) contain aromatic cycles (
