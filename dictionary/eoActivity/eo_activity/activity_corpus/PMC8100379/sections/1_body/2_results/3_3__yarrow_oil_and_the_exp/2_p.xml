<p>Mice with DSS-induced colitis exhibited statistically (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) increased expression of NF-κB and TNF-α compared with control mice. The expression of NF-κB was significantly (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01) down-regulated by treatment with the yarrow oil while TNF-α expression was almost normalized (

 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) enhanced its expression (
