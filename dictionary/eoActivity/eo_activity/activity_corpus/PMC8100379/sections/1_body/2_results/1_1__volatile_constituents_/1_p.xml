<p>The yield of essential oil obtained from 
 <italic>A. millefolium</italic> after hydrodistillation was 0.85% (Â± 0.02%) volume/dried weight (from 3 independent experiments). Overall, 41 components were separated from the essential oil after the gas chromatography analysis with 19 components being identified and quantified. The identified compounds were corresponding to 94.19% of the total separated components area percentage, and the chemical names of those 19 compounds are illustrated in
