 <xref rid="b3-ir-2020-00021" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], which enables luminal toxins, antigens, and pathogens to penetrate the mucosal layers and exaggerate the intestinal inflammation via provoking the pro-inflammatory cytokines and migration of effector leukocytes [

The main aim of the treatment is to reduce the colon inflammation and maintain remission without the need to escalate the treatment or add corticosteroids. In mild cases, the oral or rectal conventional therapy (sulfasalazine and amino-salicylates) is often enough to make remission, while in moderate cases, corticosteroids are used alone or with other classes of medications to achieve remission. On another hand, in some severe cases, conventional therapy is not effective but biologics (anti-tumor necrosis factor [TNF] and Janus kinase inhibitors) are required for maintenance of remission [
