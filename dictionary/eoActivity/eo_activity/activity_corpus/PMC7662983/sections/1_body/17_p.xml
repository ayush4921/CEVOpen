<p>Ethyl acetate, methanol, and aqueous extracts of aerial parts of 
 <italic>Anthemis tinctoria</italic> var. 
 <italic>pallida</italic> and 
 <italic>A. cretica</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>tenuiloba</italic> were investigated for their phenol and flavonoid content, antioxidant, and key enzyme (AChE, BChE. tyrosinase and Î±-glucosidase) inhibitory potentials [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-05131" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Further, ex vivo studies highlighted neuroprotective properties after an excitotoxicstimulus promoting LDH level and 5-HT turnover normalization as well as the restoration of proteins involved in neuron morphology and neurotransmission.
