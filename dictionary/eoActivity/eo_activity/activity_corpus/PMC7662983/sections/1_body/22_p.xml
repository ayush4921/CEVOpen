<p>Kurek-Gorecka and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-05131" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] reported the beneficial effects of bee products in dermatology and skin care. Honey, propolis, bee pollen, bee bread, royal jelly, beeswax and bee venom contain biologically active components, such as flavonoid schrysin, apigenin, kaempferol, quercetin, galangin, pinocembrin or naringenin. These components justify the use of bee products for medical or cosmetic skin treatment based on antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, disinfectant, antifungal and antiviral properties.
