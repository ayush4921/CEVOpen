 <p>Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens (ZRR, the fresh rhizoma of 
  <italic>Zingiber officinale</italic> Roscoe) is a widely used traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). It is also a traditional spice, widely used around the world. The present paper reviews advances in research relating to the botany, ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, pharmacology, and toxicology of Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens. In addition, this review also discusses some significant issues and the potential direction of future research on Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens. More than 100 chemical compounds have been isolated from Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens, including gingerols, essential oils, diarylheptanoids, and other compounds. Modern studies have confirmed that Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens has pharmacological effects on the nervous system and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular systems, as well as antiemetic, antibacterial, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects. However, the modern studies of Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens are still not complete and more bioactive components and potential pharmacological effects need to be explored in the future. There is no unified standard to evaluate the quality and clinical efficacy of Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens. Therefore, we should establish reasonable, accurate, and reliable quality control standards to make better use of Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens.
