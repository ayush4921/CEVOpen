<p>ZRR is widely used as a medicine and food homologous variety, especially in tropical and subtropical regions. In traditional medicine, many prescriptions containing ZRR are still in use, such as Shengjiang Xiexin Tang and Guizhi Tang. Many clinical practices have proved that the application of ZRR in preventing vomiting is successful. Modern pharmacological research has gradually verified its antiemetic effect and discussed the anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidation effects. Extracts and isolates from ZRR have multiple medical functions, especially for the nervous system and the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular system. However, there are still some problems that need further study and discussion.</p>
