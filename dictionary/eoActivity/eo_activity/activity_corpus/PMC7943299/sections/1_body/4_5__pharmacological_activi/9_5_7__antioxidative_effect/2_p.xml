<p>Some pharmacological effects of ZRR are achieved through antioxidant action. For example, Mohammed conducted experiments to evaluate whether ZEE effectively protect the thyroid oxidative damage induced by bisphenol A in male rats. The authors proposed that ZEE protected the thyroid oxidative damage and thyroid hormone disorder by activating Nrf2/HO-1 gene expression and promoting the synthesis of thyroxine [

 <sup>−4</sup> g/mL) reduced ionizing radiation-induced damage to human mesenchymal stem cells by reducing ROS production and altering nuclear translocation of Nrf2 [
