<p>Experimental evidence suggested that learning and memory impairment in mouse could be improved by 6-shogaol both in vitro and in vivo. 6-Shogaol decreased the levels of CysLT1R/cathepsin B and amyloid-beta in the brain of mice. Therefore, 6-shogaol may be beneficial for treating AD due to its role as a CysLT1R and cathepsin B inhibitor [
