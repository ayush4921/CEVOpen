<p>Furthermore, essential oils, polyphenols, flavonoids, and gingerols in ZRR also had antimicrobial effects. The resazurin microtiter assay plate and broth microdilution method were used to investigate the antibacterial effect of ZRR in vitro. It was found that volatile oil from ZRR inhibited 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> and 
 <italic>Nontuberculous mycobacteria</italic> [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The inhibition rate of polyphenol from ZRR to 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> was 75% [
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Flavonoids from ZRR had different degrees of inhibitory effect on the five kinds of bacteria, and the order of the inhibitory effect was 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> &gt; 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> &gt; 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> &gt; 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> &gt; 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> [
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. In the range of test concentration, gingerols had antibacterial activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, but the antibacterial effect is moderately sensitive (10–15 mm), and the antibacterial activity decreased with the decrease of gingerol concentration [
