<p>ZAE (100 mg/kg) significantly inhibited gastric cancer in 
 <italic>N</italic>-nitroso 
 <italic>N</italic>-methyl urea (MNU)-induced albino Wistar rats. The inhibitory effect was associated with combating pathological changes such as inflammation and oxidative stress [

 <sub>4</sub> cell (Sertoli cells of normal mouse testis). As the treatment concentration increased, this inhibitory effect became stronger and stronger in a dose-dependent manner. When the treatment concentration reached 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, the growth and proliferation of TM
 <sub>4</sub> cells had been basically inhibited [
