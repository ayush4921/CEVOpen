<p>ZRR is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) widely used to relieve vomiting in Asian countries. Many experts and scholars have studied the antiemetic effect of ZRR. The antiemetic effect of ZRR may be related to the 5-HT
 <sub>3</sub> receptor, M
 <sub>3</sub> cholinocepter in gastrointestinal tract [

 <sub>1</sub> receptor [

 <sup>2+</sup> influx of 5-HT
 <sub>3</sub> receptor, and noncompetitively inhibited the activation of human 5-HT
 <sub>3</sub> receptor [

Some scholars have studied the effects of ZAE (600, 300, and 150â€‰mg/kg) on vomiting in rats and found that ZAE had antiemetic effect, and its mechanism may be related to substance P, 5-HT, and the vomiting center in the central nervous system, which provided a basis for investigations into the use of the ZRR as a drug [
