<p>Treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular systems is not one of the traditional uses of ZRR, but they have been identified as potential targets as part of an in-depth study of the pharmacological effects of ZRR.

The results showed that its mechanisms are closely related to antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.</p>
