<p>Studies have found that ZRR has protective effects against focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (FCI-R) injury. For example, total phenol of ZRR was reported to improve the neurological symptoms of MCAO rats, prolonged the passive conditioned reflex latency and reduced the number of errors, and significantly reduced the area of cerebral infarction. Brain histopathological examination revealed that the number of bleeding cases and neutrophils in the treated group were significantly lower than untreated group [

ZAE significantly reduced caspase-3 gene expression, decreased Bax and Bcl-2 positive cells, and increased the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax [
