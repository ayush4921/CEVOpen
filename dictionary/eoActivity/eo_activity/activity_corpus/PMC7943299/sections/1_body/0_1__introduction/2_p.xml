<p>In recent years, many researchers have carried out in-depth research on the phytochemical and pharmacological effects of ZRR and made significant progress. Modern phytochemical studies have shown that the main components of ZRR include gingerols, essential oils, diarylheptanoids, and other compounds. Pharmacological studies have also shown that ZRR has a wide range of pharmacological effects, including effects on the nervous system and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular systems, as well as antiemetic, antibacterial, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects. This review provides information on the botanical characterizations, traditional usages, chemical constituents, pharmacological activities, toxicity, and quality control of ZRR. In this paper, we hope to have a comprehensive understanding of the effects of ZRR and also provide a basis for further research.</p>
