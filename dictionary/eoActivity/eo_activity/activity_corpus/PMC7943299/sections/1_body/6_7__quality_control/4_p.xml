<p>TCM has characteristics of multicomponent and multitarget. Hence, it is insufficient to evaluate the quality of TCM in terms of the contents of a few compounds. Yet, chemical models of multicomponent control are increasingly common in the quality evaluations of TCM. To evaluate the quality of ZRR, some scholars have measured various components. For example, Zhang determined the contents of 6 kinds of gingerols (6-gingerol, 8-gingerol, 10-gingerol, 6-shogaol, 8-shogaol, and 10-shogaol) and 4 kinds of curcumins (tetrahydrocurcumin, curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and bis-demethoxycurcumin) [

 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. To evaluate the chemical constituents of ZRR more comprehensively, HPLC and UPLC fingerprinting was established for quality control of ZRR [

 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. In addition, fingerprinting was also used to analyze the quality of ZRR from different regions [
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>] and the composition and content changes during processing [
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. There are many volatile components in ZRR, and some scholars have established GC fingerprints of volatile components in ZRR and claimed that these methods can be used to evaluate the quality of ZRR [
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Yet no quality assessment methods associated with the pharmacological activity of ZRR have been devised. It is obviously inadequate to evaluate the quality of ZRR based on chemical constituents alone, warranting the establishment of more activity-related or chemical-activity-based quality evaluation methods.
