<p id="para0025">The study was authorized by the ethical committee of Ibn Tofail University. Before starting data collection, we obtained oral informed permission in each case on a site level and then individually before each interview. We also informed herbalists that it was a student academic project and the investigation was only for our research purposes, not for any financial or other benefits. Herbalists provided verbal informed consent to engage in this study; they were free to withdraw their information at any point of time. Those informants accepted freely to the interview and consented to have their names and personal data to be published.</p>
