 <p>Synucleinopathies are a group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the accumulation of α-synuclein aggregates in neurons, nerve fibers or glial cells. Three main types of diseases belong to the synucleinopathies: Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy. All of them develop as a result of an interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Emerging evidence suggests that epigenetic mechanisms play an essential role in the development of synucleinopathies. Since there is no disease-modifying treatment for these disorders at this time, interest is growing in plant-derived chemicals as a potential treatment option. Phytochemicals are substances of plant origin that possess biological activity, which might have effects on human health. Phytochemicals with neuroprotective activity target different elements in pathogenic pathways due to their antioxidants, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic properties, and ability to reduce cellular stress. Multiple recent studies demonstrate that the beneficial effects of phytochemicals may be explained by their ability to modulate the expression of genes implicated in synucleinopathies and other diseases. These substances may regulate transcription directly via transcription factors (TFs) or play the role of epigenetic regulators through their effect on histone modification, DNA methylation, and RNA-based mechanisms. Here, we summarize new data about the impact of phytochemicals on the pathogenesis of synucleinopathies through regulation of gene expression.</p>
