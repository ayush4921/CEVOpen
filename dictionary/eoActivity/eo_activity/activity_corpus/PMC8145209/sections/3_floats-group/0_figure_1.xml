  <p>α-synuclein structure and depositions of misfolded protein in the brain. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Structural organization of the human α-synuclein. The N-terminal domain contains repeated lipid-binding sequences KTKEGV (blue rectangles). Mutations linked with familial cases of PD and sites of phosphorylation are shown. A30P, E46K, H50Q, G51D, A53T/E—point mutations in the α-synuclein gene. Y39, S87, Y125, S129, S133—sites of phosphorylation. The majority of α-synuclein in inclusions is phosphorylated. (
   <bold>B)</bold> Lewy body in substantia nigra of PD patients. (
   <bold>C)</bold> α-synuclein inclusions in DLB shown by arrowheads. (
   <bold>D)</bold> α-synuclein inclusions in MSA. Bars are 10 μm. Reproduced with permission from an article by Odagiri et al. [
