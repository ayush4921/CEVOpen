  <p>Jasmonic acid methyl ester isolated from jasmine flowers possesses neuroprotective effect in human brain and simultaneously helps plants to resist stress. Jasmonic acid signaling involves E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, which tag substrates with ubiquitin. After tagging the proteins become susceptible for degradation by proteasomes. The subsequent step utilizes TFs to effect physiological changes. A key regulator in JA signaling is JAZ. Two TFs, MYC2 and ERF1, orchestrate subsequent changes in gene expression [
