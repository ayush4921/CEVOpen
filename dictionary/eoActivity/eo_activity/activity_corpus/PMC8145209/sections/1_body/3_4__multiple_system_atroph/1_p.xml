<p>MSA is a debilitating and fatal neurodegenerative disorder clinically characterized by a combination of parkinsonism, autonomic failure and cerebellar ataxia [

 <xref rid="B30-biomolecules-11-00624" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. MSA may be considered a form of atypical parkinsonism that affects a patient’s motor ability and autonomic function. Pathologically MSA is characterized by neuronal loss and gliosis in the cerebellum or basal ganglia, which usually correlate with the clinical phenotype [
 <xref rid="B31-biomolecules-11-00624" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The causes of MSA are unclear, and therapies significantly improving the disease course have not been developed. Recent studies revealed several signs linking MSA pathogenesis with PD, including inflammation, α-synuclein aggregation in oligodendroglia, protein misfolding, impairment of the tubulin polymerization-promoting protein, and mitochondrial dysfunction [

Preventive strategies inhibiting GCI formation may overturn disease progression. Clinical trials of riluzole, growth hormone, minocycline, rifampicin, and epigallocatechin gallate have been conducted, but did not show noticeable benefits [
