<p>Genetic mutations, mitochondrial dysfunction, defects in proteolytic systems, and neuroinflammation contribute to their pathophysiology [

Although the three types of synucleinopathies share some common mechanisms, a growing body of evidence indicates the existence of structural and functional differences underlying these diseases’ pathogenesis. One of them is the presence of distinct α-synuclein strains in samples from patients with PD, DLB, and MSA [

There is no disease-modifying treatment for these disorders, restricting cure options to symptomatic relief measures and palliative procedures. Thus, developing new effective therapeutic strategies to control and cure these devastating diseases is an urgent need [
