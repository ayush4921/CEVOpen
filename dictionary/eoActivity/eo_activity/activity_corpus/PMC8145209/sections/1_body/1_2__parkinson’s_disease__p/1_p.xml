<p>PD is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer’s disease. It is a progressive and severely debilitating disorder associated with decreasing dopamine-secreting neurons and Lewy bodies’ formation in the substantia nigra and basal ganglia [

 <xref rid="B16-biomolecules-11-00624" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Despite the availability of symptomatic treatments, methods for health improvement in PD patients remain scarce. The majority of the treatment methods ease the symptoms, including the relief of motor impairment, without addressing the disease’s basic causes, so there is no proven disease-modifying therapy.
