<p>Familial PD cases account for less than 10% of the overall incidence, and the remaining 90% are sporadic forms of the disease [
 <xref rid="B17-biomolecules-11-00624" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Several rare familial forms of PD have been described. The first one was identified in an Italian kindred and three unrelated families of Greek origin due to a mutation in the Î±-synuclein gene [

Other causative mutations in several other genes, for example, PARK2 (E3 ubiquitin protein ligase), PINK1 (PTEN-induced kinase 1), PARK7 (DJ1, deglycase), LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat kinase), VPS35 (Vacuolar protein sorting ortholog 35, CHCHD2 (Coiled-Coil-Helix-Coiled-Coil-Helix Domain Containing 2) have been linked to familial forms of PD [
