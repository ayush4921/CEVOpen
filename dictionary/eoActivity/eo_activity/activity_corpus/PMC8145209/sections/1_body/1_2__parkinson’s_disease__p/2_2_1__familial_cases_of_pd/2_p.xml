<p>Approximately 19 PD-causing genes, including ten autosomal dominant and nine autosomal recessive ones, have been identified [
 <xref rid="B19-biomolecules-11-00624" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Notably, most genome-wide association study (GWAS) hits are driven by noncoding variations and most probably are associated with gene expression regulation [

 <xref rid="B20-biomolecules-11-00624" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the alterations in gene expression are associated with PD pathology, and epigenetic mechanisms play an essential role in the pathophysiology of this disorder [
