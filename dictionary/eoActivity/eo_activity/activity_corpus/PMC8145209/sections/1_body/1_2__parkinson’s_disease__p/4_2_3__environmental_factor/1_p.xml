<p>Some environmental factors reduce the risk of PD, whereas others may raise it. Many natural products, including the phytochemicals present in dietary products, decrease PD development risk (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec6-biomolecules-11-00624">Section 6</xref>). Nutrition might grow to become a preventive and even therapeutic alternative against PD, especially if combined with other interventions like L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) and its derivatives. However, according to epidemiologic and toxicological data, there is a consistent association between exposure to herbicides, pesticides, and other exogenous toxicants (for example, paraquat or rotenone) and PD [
