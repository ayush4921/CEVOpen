<p>An important association of DNMT1 with PD pathogenesis was described by Desplats and coauthors [
 <xref rid="B44-biomolecules-11-00624" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. They reported that DNMT1 is downregulated in the postmortem brain of PD patients [

 <xref rid="B45-biomolecules-11-00624" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. It was reported that the protein expression of DNMT1 was reduced, whereas the corresponding mRNA levels increased in the cellular and mouse models of PD [
 <xref rid="B46-biomolecules-11-00624" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Further investigation identified a role of an additional regulator of the methylation process. As shown recently, miR-17 mediates DNMT1 downregulation and may be responsible for the aberrant DNA methylation in PD [
