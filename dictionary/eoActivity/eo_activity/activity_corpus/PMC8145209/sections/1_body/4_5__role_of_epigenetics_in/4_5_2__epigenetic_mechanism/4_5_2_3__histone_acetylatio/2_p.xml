<p>There is an opinion that DNA hydroxymethylation, global hyperacetylation, and HDAC dependent regulation of α-synuclein expression play a more significant role in PD development than mechanisms directly controlling DNA methylation [

The best-studied regulator of α-synuclein expression is a CpG island in intron 1. Its efficiency is especially high in cells with a low endogenous level of α-synuclein expression [
