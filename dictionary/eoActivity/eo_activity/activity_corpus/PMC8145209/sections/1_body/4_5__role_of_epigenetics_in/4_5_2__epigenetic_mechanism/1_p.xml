<p>DNA methylation, histone modifications, and RNA-based mechanisms are the principal epigenetic mechanisms involved in PD pathophysiology (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-11-00624-f002">Figure 2</xref>). These biochemical processes regulate the expression of α–synuclein and other proteins involved in PD pathogenesis. One of the indirect proofs of the role of epigenetics in PD pathogenesis is the finding that DNA in PD patients has increased cytosine modifications, especially in genes responsible for neurogenesis, synaptic structure and neurodevelopment [
