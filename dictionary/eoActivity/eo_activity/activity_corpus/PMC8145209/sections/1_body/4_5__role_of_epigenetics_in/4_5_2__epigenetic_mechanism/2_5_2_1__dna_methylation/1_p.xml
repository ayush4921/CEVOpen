<p>DNA methylation is one of the best-characterized chromatin modifications. The human genome is mostly methylated on CG bases cytosine–phosphate–guanine motifs, which are enriched in promoters. The methylation of these regions by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) causes gene silencing. Abnormal DNA methylation is associated with the pathogenesis of PD. DNMTs are the enzymes for the establishment and maintenance of DNA methylation patterns. However, there is a hypothesis that DNA methylation may not be the most attractive target for the development of PD treatment [

Other mechanisms, such as global hyperacetylation, and histone deacetylase (HDAC) dependent regulation of α-synuclein expression may be more prominent targets from the current perspective. Corresponding histone modifiers may become convenient targets for small molecule inhibition therapeutics in the future [
