<p>Several epigenetic mechanisms are associated with MSA pathogenesis. Rydbirk and coauthors have investigated 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine changes throughout the genome of MSA patients and control individuals [
 <xref rid="B51-biomolecules-11-00624" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. They found five significantly different 5mC probes in the genome of MSA patients. One of these probes mapped to the apoptosis resistant E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 (AREL1) gene implicated in antigen presentation was reduced in MSA patients. This decrease correlated with elevated 5 mC levels. Several functional DNA methylation modules are involved in inflammatory processes. In the brains of MSA patients, reduced 5 mC levels on AREL1 were concordant with elevated level of gene expression of both AREL1 and MHC Class I HLA genes.
