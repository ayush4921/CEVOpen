<p>In another study, Bettencourt and coauthors [
 <xref rid="B53-biomolecules-11-00624" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] described DNA methylation changes across brain regions in MSA with different degrees of GCI pathology. We identified 157 CpG sites and 79 genomic regions where DNA methylation was significantly altered in the MSA cases. Some DNA methylation changes mirror the MSA-associated pathology, for example, cerebellum-specific alterations [
