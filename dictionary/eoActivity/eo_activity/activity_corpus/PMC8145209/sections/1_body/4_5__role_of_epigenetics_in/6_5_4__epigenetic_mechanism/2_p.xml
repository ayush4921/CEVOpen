<p>In another study consistent alterations in myelin-associated oligodendrocyte basic protein (MAOBP) and huntingtin interacting protein 1 (HIP1) DNA methylation status were described in MSA patients [

 <xref rid="B53-biomolecules-11-00624" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In particular, reduced MOBP mRNA levels correlated with elevated DNA methylation in MSA patients. A distinct association between the methylation of HIP1 DNA and gene expression levels has been found in MSA patients compared to healthy controls [
