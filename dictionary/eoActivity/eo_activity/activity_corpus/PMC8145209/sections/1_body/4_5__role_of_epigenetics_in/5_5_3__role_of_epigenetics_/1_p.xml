<p>Funahashi et al. examined an association of CpG island methylation level in the Î±-synuclein gene with DLB [
 <xref rid="B50-biomolecules-11-00624" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The authors found that intron 1 methylation in leucocytes is significantly reduced in DLB patients compared to controls. Similar results indicating a reduction in DNA methylation in DLB patients were described by Desplats (2011) [
 <xref rid="B44-biomolecules-11-00624" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. These authors found that hypomethylation is associated with the translocation of DNMT1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, similar to the findings described in PD patients [
 <xref rid="B44-biomolecules-11-00624" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Thus, similar epigenetic dysregulation occurs in DLB and PD.
