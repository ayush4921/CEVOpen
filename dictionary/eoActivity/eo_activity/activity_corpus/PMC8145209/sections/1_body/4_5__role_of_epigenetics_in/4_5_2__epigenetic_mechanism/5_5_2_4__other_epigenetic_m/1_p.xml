<p>Other important epigenetic players are the noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). Recent genome-wide studies have shown that &lt;2% of the human genome codes for proteins. However, the genome is extensively transcribed, producing regulatory noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). Noncoding RNAs may be categorized in two main groups on the basis of their length. The most thoroughly studied microRNAs (miRNAs) are 20â€“22 nucleotide-long molecules that downregulate the gene expression on the post-transcriptional level, binding to mRNAs. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have lengths of more than 200 nucleotides. They regulate gene expression through various mechanisms, most often at the epigenetic level [
