<p>DNA methylation and post-translational modifications of nucleosomal histones (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-11-00624-f002">Figure 2</xref>) alter chromatin structure and regulate gene expression. The study of epigenetic regulation has many exciting translational aspects, one of which is analysis of association explaining the mechanisms linking gene and diet. Investigation in this field can elucidate the relationship between nutrition and neurodegenerative diseases. Changes in the epigenome may cause transcriptional alterations and genomic instability, thus contributing to the development of neurodegenerative diseases and other age-related disorders [
