<p>Negatively charged DNA is wrapped around positively charged histones forming a nucleosome, a simple chromatin unit (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-11-00624-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Chemical alterations to histone proteins include methylation and acetylation. These histone modifications can induce the formation of an open DNA state. The open state enables gene expression by allowing TFs and enzymes to bind to DNA. Alternatively, chromatin may acquire a closed heterochromatin state suppressing gene expression by inhibiting the initiation of transcript [
