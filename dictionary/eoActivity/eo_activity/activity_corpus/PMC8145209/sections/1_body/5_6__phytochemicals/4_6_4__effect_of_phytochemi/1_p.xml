<p>Multiple studies related to PD using various model systems have shown that the beneficial properties of phytochemicals may be displayed through their effect on transcriptional machinery by changing gene expression levels. For example, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) significantly increases the protein expression of FOXO1, Sirt1, CAT, FABP1, GSTA2, ACSL1, and CPT2 and simultaneously reduces the levels of NF-ÎºB, ACC1, and FAS protein. These gene expression changes decrease the level of inflammatory and oxidative stress and extend the lifespan in animal models [
