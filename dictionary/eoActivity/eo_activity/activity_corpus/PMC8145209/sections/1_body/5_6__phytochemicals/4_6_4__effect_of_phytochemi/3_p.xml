<p>Menendez et al. described that secoiridoid-rich phenolic fractions from extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) activated resveratrol-like transcriptomic signatures [
 <xref rid="B84-biomolecules-11-00624" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Secoiridoids belong to a subclass of iridoids resulting from the cleavage of a bond in the cyclopentane ring. Secoiridoids from EVOO upregulated SIRT1 and inhibited several metallothionein (MT) gene isoforms.
