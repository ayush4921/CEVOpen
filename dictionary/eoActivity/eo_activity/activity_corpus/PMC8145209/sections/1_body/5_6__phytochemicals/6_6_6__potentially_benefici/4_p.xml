<p>Gaps in our knowledge. There are many gaps in the current knowledge about the epigenetic activity of phytochemicals. First, there is a deficiency of human trials, which are essential because the human organism displays high complexity in responding to external stimuli. As a result, the findings from cell and animal models are often difficult to translate into human interventions. Another gap is the insufficient knowledge about the molecular mechanisms underlying epigenetics-related interactions. For example, Î±-synuclein in three forms of synucleinopathies is present in different conformational strains with dissimilar biochemical and biophysical properties [
