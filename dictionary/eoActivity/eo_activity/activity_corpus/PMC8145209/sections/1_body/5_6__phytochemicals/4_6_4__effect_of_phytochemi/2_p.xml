<p>In another study, phytochemicals extracted from purple yam (
 <italic>Dioscorea alata L</italic>) enhanced the expression of stress-protective genes such as Hsp-16.2, Hsp-6, Hsp-60, and Gst-4. These plant extracts acted via master TFs: HSF-1 and SKN-1/Nrf2 and regulated tic stress response, enhancing the expression of glyoxalase-1, heat shock, and antioxidant genes [
