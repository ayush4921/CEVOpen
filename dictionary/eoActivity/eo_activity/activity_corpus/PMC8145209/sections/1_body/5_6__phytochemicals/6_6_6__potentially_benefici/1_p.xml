<p>The information about phytochemicals’ use for patients with MSA is rather limited. Sakakibara and coauthors [
 <xref rid="B88-biomolecules-11-00624" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] investigated herb extracts’ effects on patients with MSA and PD. They used Dai-Kenchu-To (DKT) consisting of a mixture of 50% ginger, 30% “Nin-jin” (gin-seng), and 20% “Sansho” (Japanese pepper, Zanthoxylum). DKT is a dietary herb extract used for relieving abdominal distension in Eastern countries. The DKT was well tolerated and improved gastrointestinal tract function both in PD and MSA patients. There were no noticeable differences between the MSA and PD groups in their response to DKT treatment.
