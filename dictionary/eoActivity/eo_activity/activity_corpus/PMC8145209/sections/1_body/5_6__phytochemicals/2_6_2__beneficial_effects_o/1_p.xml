<p>Phytochemicals possess different mechanisms of action; some of them are targeted at specific routes affecting signaling pathways, while others control neurodegeneration via binding to TFs or through epigenetic mechanisms. A group of phytochemicals are able to upregulate the expression of cytoprotective genes [
 <xref rid="B63-biomolecules-11-00624" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. There are phytochemicals whose activity is directed against common destructive pathways shared by synucleinopathies and other neurodegenerative diseases. For example, dietary saffron regulates apoptosis, inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction by upregulating several genes (Cyr61, Gpx8, Ndufs4, and Nos1ap) with known neuroprotective actions [
