<p>Interestingly, jasmonate possesses beneficial effect not only in humans, but also in plants, helping them to adapt to external stressors by the regulation of stress responding genes. Jasmonates are vital phytohormones for plant survival and development. Jasmonic acid and its derivatives induce the synthesis of defensive chemical substances that protect plants against a wide range of stress [

An area of further thrilling investigation is deciphering whether the protective activities exerted by jasmonate in plants and humans are realized via similar or different pathways and mechanisms.
