<p>Phytochemicals are structurally diverse biologically active compounds of plant origin that have important medicinal and nutritional properties. Phytochemicals are diverse in structure and affect various steps in the epigenetic mechanism. For example, polyphenols from green tea inhibit DNA methylation, while an isothiocyanate sulforaphane from broccoli sprouts, and diallyl disulfide from garlic are potent HDAC inhibitors [

 <xref rid="B56-biomolecules-11-00624" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In other studies, the epigenetic effect of polyphenol on gene expression is realized via miRNAs, which are considered global regulators controlling cell homeostasis and modulating inflammation [

A wide range of plant origin substances providing health benefits includes flavonoids, polyphenols, anthocyanidins, carotenoids, phytoestrogens, terpenoids, phytosterols, fibers, and other compounds. Phytochemicals from medicinal plants often offer a better and safer alternative to synthetic medications. The anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiallergic, immunomodulatory and antitumoral activities of phytochemicals have been known for a long time; however, the molecular mechanisms of their action are often unclear and need further investigation. Accumulating data indicate that their biological activity is often associated with their role as regulators of gene expression. Phytochemicals may modulate specific genesâ€™ transcriptional activity acting directly on specific TFs or exert their action through epigenetic mechanisms [
