<p>The perception of how the epigenetic mechanisms contribute to the pathogenesis of these diseases is a burning challenge, and the results of new investigations could have major importance for the development of future therapy. Epigenetics promises the explanation of many medical mysteries, including the etiology and pathophysiology of synucleinopathies. The study of the epigenetic mechanisms will serve as a useful tool for discovering specific phytochemicals to convert them to a valuable protective and even a therapeutic substitute for the treatment of synucleinopathies. Innovative studies should be performed as short-term projects analyzing various combinations of phytochemicals, in which biomarkers for disease outcome along with molecular markers (-omics) and genetic variability between individuals are incorporated.</p>
