<p>The prevalence of synucleinopathies is rising, but efficient medications affecting these diseases have not been developed yet. Therefore, finding novel targets for their treatment and searching for new substances to improve conditions and cure these disorders are urgently needed. Emerging evidence suggests that plant-derived substances may be successfully used as an alternative to existing drugs. Phytochemicals target various elements in the pathogenesis of synucleinopathies, exerting a neuroprotective effect. Numerous studies revealed that healthy dietary practice with a high content of plant-derived substances boosts brain health, improves cognitive function, and suppresses neurodegenerative events [

Furthermore, the effect of numerous food-derived compounds from plants was tested in an attempt to improve the course of neurodegenerative diseases and to find an alternative to existing drugs. Problems with permeability often complicate the clinical research on the beneficial effects of phytochemicals through the brainâ€“blood barrier (BBB), fast metabolism, and reduced stability inside the brain.
