<p>DLB is an age-associated neurodegenerative disease characterized by a progressive cognitive decline that restricts daily activities and affects everyday life. DLB develops due to a combination of genetic variations and epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation and histone alterations modulating the level of gene expression [

Cholinesterase inhibitors are most often used for DLB treatments, but they are not disease-modifying drugs, and they are unable to eliminate the main course of the disease. The absence of an effective DLB therapy may be explained by a lack of comprehensive understanding of the mechanism underlying the disease. There are no medications specifically for the treatment of DLB approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Therefore, drugs developed and tested for AD and PD treatment are sometimes used for DLB therapy [
