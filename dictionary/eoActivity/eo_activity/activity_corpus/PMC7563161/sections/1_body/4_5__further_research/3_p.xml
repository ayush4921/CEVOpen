<p>Furthermore, to assess the pharmacological activity of specific compounds, purity (at least 95%) and identity should be characterized. Indeed, when assessed as mixtures, the subtle interactions which can be established among phytochemicals make it difficult to understand whether the observed benefits are attributable to a specific class or to the whole phytocomplex. For instance, both fatty acids and polyphenols can be involved in the immunomodulating effects of PUFA-enriched plant oils. Moreover, as found for both polysaccharides and fatty acids, among the same class, different subclasses can co-occur, thus contributing to the whole effects. </p>
