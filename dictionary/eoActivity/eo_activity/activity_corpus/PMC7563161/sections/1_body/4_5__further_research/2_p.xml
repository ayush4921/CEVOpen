 <xref rid="B225-vaccines-08-00468" ref-type="bibr">225</xref>], herbal products under study must be characterized for the phytochemical composition, using validated analytical methodologies, and for the extraction procedures; moreover, the starting material should be fully defined in terms of origin (country and region), cultivation conditions, botanical identity and plant part. The content of specific compounds, used as analytical or active markers, should be determined too. These requirements are needed to ensure reproducible pharmacological/clinical activity and to compare different studies. Indeed, using nonstandardized phytocomplexes increases variability of the biological response, thus limiting the reliability and validity of the studies.
