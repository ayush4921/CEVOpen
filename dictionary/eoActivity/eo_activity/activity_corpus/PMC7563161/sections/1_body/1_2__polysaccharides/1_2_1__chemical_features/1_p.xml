<p>Polysaccharides are carbohydrate macromolecules containing at least 10 monosaccharide units, joined by glycosidic linkages to form long-chain molecules, which can be both linear and highly branched. They are called homopolysaccharides when constituted of the same monosaccharide unit, while heteropolysaccharides if different units are present. Some of them are also referred to as dietary fibres, meaning that these macromolecules are neither digested nor absorbed in the human small intestine [
