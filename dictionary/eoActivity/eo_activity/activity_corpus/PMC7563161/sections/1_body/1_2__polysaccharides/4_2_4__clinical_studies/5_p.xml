<p>Clinical trials concerning the β-glucan immunomodulatory properties have also been carried out, although in some cases, yeast-derived-glucan were used. Particularly, three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have evaluated the effects of short-term β-glucan supplementation on children with chronic respiratory problems. After 30 days’ treatment, significant improvements in immunoglobulin, lysozyme, exhaled nitric oxide, and calprotectin production were found [

Particularly, the ability of the combination to prevent or treat recurrent respiratory infections in children was studied [

 <xref rid="B140-vaccines-08-00468" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. In both cases, resveratrol plus carboxymethyl-β-glucan had a positive impact on children clinical conditions. Indeed, nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, sneezing, cough, fever, medication use, medical visits, and school absence were significantly reduced. Moreover, resveratrol plus carboxymethyl-β-glucan have also been shown to relief nasal symptoms in children with allergic rhinitis, due to pollen allergy [
