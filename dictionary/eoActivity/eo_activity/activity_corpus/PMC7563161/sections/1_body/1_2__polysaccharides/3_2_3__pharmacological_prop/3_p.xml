<p>Pectic polysaccharides from 
 <italic>Citrus unshiu</italic> Marc. have been shown to simultaneously regulate the expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Particularly, they increased the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6 and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-12 in macrophage RAW264.7, so showing a regulatory mechanism to maintain an equilibrium state [

 <italic>E. purpurea</italic> has been reported to increase macrophages activation and IL-1, TNF-α and interferon (IFN)-β production [

The activation of macrophages by plant polysaccharides seems to be due to specific receptors present on their surface, which initiates the immune response, and exerts an immunomodulatory effect. These receptors are called pattern recognition molecules, and include: Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), CD14, complement receptor 3 (CR3), scavenger receptor (SR), mannose receptor (MR), and Dectin-1. Their activation determines a series of intracellular signaling cascades, leading to the transcriptional activation and production of inflammation-related cytokines [
