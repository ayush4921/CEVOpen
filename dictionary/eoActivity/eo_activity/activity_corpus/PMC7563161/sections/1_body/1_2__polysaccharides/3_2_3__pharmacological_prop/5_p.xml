<p>The activation of natural killer (NK) cells also contributes to the immunity modulation by polysaccharides. Indeed, it has been shown that 
 <italic>A. membranaceus</italic> polysaccharides can enhance the activity and killing effects of NK cells and promote their proliferation in rats with gastric cancer [
