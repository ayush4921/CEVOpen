<p>Pectins are complex polysaccharides which contain a common galactopyranosyluronic acid. Homogalacturonans, xylogalacturonan, apiogalacturonan, rhamnogalacturonan, type I and II arabinogalactans belong to this class. Particularly, type I arabinogalactans (AG-I) possess an α-1-arabinofuranosyl and β-D-galactopyranosyl units linked via position 3 at the main chain, while type II arabinogalactans (AG-II) comprise highly branched polysaccharides with ramified chains of (β1→3)- and (β1→6)-D-galactopyranosyl units [
