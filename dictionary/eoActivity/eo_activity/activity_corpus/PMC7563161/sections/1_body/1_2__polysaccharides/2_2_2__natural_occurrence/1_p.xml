<p>Polysaccharides are naturally occuring in animal body fluids, cell walls, bacteria, yeast and fungi, extra cellular fluids, and in plant seeds, stems and leaves, which represent the focus of the present review. The main advantage of plant polysaccharides seems to be the low toxicity with respect to immunomodulatory bacterial polysaccharides and synthetic compounds [
