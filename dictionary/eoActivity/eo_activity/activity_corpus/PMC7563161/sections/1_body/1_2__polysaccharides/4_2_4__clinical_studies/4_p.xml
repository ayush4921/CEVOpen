<p>Another randomized, placebo controlled, double-blind clinical trial investigated the effect of different echinacea preparations, namely Echinaforce
 <sup>®</sup> (
 <italic>E. purpurea</italic> preparation from 95% herba and 5% radix), 
 <italic>E. purpurea</italic> concentrate (same preparation at 7 times higher concentration), special 
 <italic>E. purpurea</italic> radix preparation (totally different from that of Echinaforce
 <sup>®</sup>) on the reduction of the complaint index, defined by 12 symptoms in healthy, adult volunteers who caught a common cold. The treatment continued until the enrolled patients felt healthy again, but not longer than 7 days. The supplementation with Echinaforce
 <sup>®</sup> and its concentrated preparation showed to be significantly more effective than the special echinacea extract or placebo. Moreover, all treatments were well tolerated [
