<p>Furthermore, indirect effects are involved in the immunomodulatory properties of polysaccharides. In particular, dietary fibers (e.g., inulin, mannan, β-glucan, pectin) are metabolized by intestinal bacteria in the anaerobic environment of the cecum and colon, so generating SCFA, such as acetate, propionate and butyrate [
