<p>Galactans are polysaccharides rich in galactose and include, beside type I and II arabinogalactans, carrageenans, chemically characterized by repeating disaccharide units of sulfated or unsulfated D-galactose, that are linked by (β1→4)- and (α1→3)-bonds. Low molecular weight (&lt;20 kDa) and a high degree of sulfation have been reported as features that high influence their immunomodulatory properties [
