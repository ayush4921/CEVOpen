<p>In a clinical trial on 
 <italic>A. membranaceus</italic> by Jiang et al. [
 <xref rid="B130-vaccines-08-00468" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>], twenthy-eight stable continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients were treated with peritoneal dialysis fluid containing astragalus (20 mL/2 L) for one week. An increase in the macrophage phagocytic capacity, NO and TNF-Î± contents were observed in patients compared to those before the treatment [

 <xref rid="B131-vaccines-08-00468" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>] investigated the effect of astragalus pre-operative treatment of colorectal cancer patients (
 <italic>n</italic> = 128) on immune function. Results showed that astragalus pre-operative treatment promoted the NK cell activity in postoperative patients. In addition, the possible immunomodulatory activity of astragalus in patients with acute exacerbations of bronchial asthma (n = 72) has been investigated [
 <xref rid="B132-vaccines-08-00468" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]. Particularly, it was observed that the combination of conventional therapy with astragalus injection for 14 days improved the effects of routine treatment, by enhancing T lymphocyte and NK-cells immune function.
