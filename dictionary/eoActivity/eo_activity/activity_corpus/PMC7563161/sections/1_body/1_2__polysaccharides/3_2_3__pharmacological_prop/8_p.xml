<p>Advax also enhanced the immunogenicity of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs) in mice and guinea pigs, by increasing both anti-HBs antibody titers and anti-HBs CD4 and CD8 T-cells. Th1, Th2 and Th17 responses were increased too [

Astragalus polysaccharides were also used as adjuvants of Hepatitis B virus DNA vaccine in a mice model, showing increased HBsAg-specific antibody levels, higher activity of T cells, the production of IL-4, IL-2 and IFN-γ by CD4+ T cells, and IFN-γ expression of CD8+ T cells. Moreover, a stimulation of cytotoxic lymphocytes and dendritic cells maturation, and a reduction in the frequency of regulatory T cells were observed [
