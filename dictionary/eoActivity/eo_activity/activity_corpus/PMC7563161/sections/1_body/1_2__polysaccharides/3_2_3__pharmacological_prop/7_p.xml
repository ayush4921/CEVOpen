Their ability to affect the immune system by inducing Th1 and/or Th2 type immune response makes polysaccharides suitable adjuvants of the vaccine. Among them, inulin, chitosan, glucans and mannans have been most extensively studied. Particularly, the gamma and delta forms of inulin fructan have shown adjuvant activity against infectious pathogens by stimulating both Th1 and Th2 responses without inducing immunoglobulin E (IgE) production [

Moreover, Advax, a polysaccharide derived from delta inulin, has demonstrated to increase the immunization derived from influenza vaccine in mice. Particularly, an induction of neutralizing antibody and memory B-cell against influenza, an increase in CD4 and CD8 T-cell proliferation, and enhanced levels of IL-2, IFN-γ, IL-5, IL-6 were highlighted [
