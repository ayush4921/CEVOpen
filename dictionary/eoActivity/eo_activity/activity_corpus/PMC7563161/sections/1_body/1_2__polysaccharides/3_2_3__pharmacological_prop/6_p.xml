<p>Adaptive immunity is also modulated by plant polysaccharides. Particularly, Fan et al. have shown that polysaccharides from 
 <italic>A. membranaceus</italic> significantly up-regulated the proliferation of B lymphocytes, probably through the interaction with immunoglobulin on the surface of B cells [

 <italic>A. membranaceus</italic> polysaccharides were also able to increase the number of CD3+CD4+CD8+ memory T helper (Th) cells and CD3+CD4-CD8+ cytotoxic T cells [
