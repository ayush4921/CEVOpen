<p>Immunity modulation by plant polysaccharides can be achieved also by modulating the cytokine release from intestinal dendritic cells. Indeed, pectin has been shown to reduce IL-6 and IL-10 release induced by the synthetic lipopeptide P3CSK4 [

Moreover, inulin, pectin, arabinoxylan and β-glucan have been found to elevate IL-10/IL-12 ratio and to reduce the release of IFN-γ, IL-12, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, macrophage inflammatory proteins (MIP)-1α, RANTES and TNF-α by dendritic cells [
