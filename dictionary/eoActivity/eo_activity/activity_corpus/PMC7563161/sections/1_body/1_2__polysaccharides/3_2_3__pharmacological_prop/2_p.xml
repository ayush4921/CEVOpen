<p>The immunomodulatory effects of plant polysaccharides on macrophages are mainly achieved through the generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and NOS), and the stimulation of cytokines secretion, cell proliferation, and macrophage phagocytic activity [

 <italic>A. membranaceus</italic> polysaccharides have been shown to promote nitric oxide (NO) synthesis in macrophages, by inducing the gene expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), through the activation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-ÎºB)/Rel [
