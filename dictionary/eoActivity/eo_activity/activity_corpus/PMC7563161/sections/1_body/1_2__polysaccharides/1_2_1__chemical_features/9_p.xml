<p>Fructans are polysaccharides which constitute up to 70 fructose units with a sucrolose terminal molecule. They are classified in inulin with a (β2→1)-D-fructofuranosyl, levan with a (β2→6)-D- fructofuranosyl, and mixed type, with both (β2→1)- and (β2→6)-linked d- fructofuranosyl moieties. A helical conformation has been associated with the modulatory activity on the immune system [

Other monomers attached to their backbone include α-D- glucopyranosyl A units (glucuronoxylans) and α-L-arabinofuranosyl units (arabinoxylans). A correlation between their structure and activity has not been elucidated yet [
