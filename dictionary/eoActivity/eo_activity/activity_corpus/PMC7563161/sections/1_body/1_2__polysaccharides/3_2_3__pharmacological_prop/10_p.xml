<p>Moreover, it has been highlighted that SCFA can reach T lymphocyte nucleus, so modulating several functions through a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition. Recently, SCFA have been reported able to induce T cells metabolic alterations by enhancing the mTOR complex activity. Particularly, after absorption into T cells, SCFA can stimulate the activity of mTOR complex, so increasing the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA. Moreover, the acetyl groups from SCFA can be link to CoA and enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The increased levels of citrate are exported from mitochondria into the cytoplasm, where the enzyme ATP citrate lyase converts it into acetyl-CoA, then used by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) for histone acetylation and the regulation of cytokine gene expression [
