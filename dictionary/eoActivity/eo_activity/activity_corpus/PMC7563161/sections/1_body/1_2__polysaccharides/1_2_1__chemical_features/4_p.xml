<p>Glucans are based on the D-glucopyranosyl unit (homoglucans); the different glycosidic bonds, namely (β1→4), (β1→3), and (β 1→6) or (α1→3), (α 1→4), and (α 1→6), allow the production of linear and branched glucans. It seems that (β1→3)-D-glucan moiety, triple helix conformations, sulfation and carboxymethylation of (β 1→3)-D-glucans, and chain acetylation are involved in glucan immunostimulatory activity. Regarding (α1→6) (α1→4)-D-glucans, their structure activity relationship is less characterized [
