<p>Unsaturated fatty acids can be characterized on the basis of the 
 <italic>cis-</italic> or 
 <italic>trans-</italic> orientation of the double bonds. Usually, natural fatty acids carry a 
 <italic>cis-</italic> configuration, although some 
 <italic>trans-</italic>fatty acids can also occur in foods as a consequence of the hydrogenation process, which can move double bonds from their naturally occurring position to a 
 <italic>trans-</italic>configuration [
