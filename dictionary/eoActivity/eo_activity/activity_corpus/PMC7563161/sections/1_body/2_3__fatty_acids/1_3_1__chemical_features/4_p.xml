<p>Furthermore, PUFA class includes fatty acids such as α-linolenic acid (ALA; C18:3), linoleic acid (LA; C18:2) and further long-chain metabolites [
 <xref rid="B143-vaccines-08-00468" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]. The number of carbon atoms and unsaturated bond position are used for the systematic nomenclature of FA. Moreover, the greek letters omega (ω) and delta (∆) are included, to indicate how far a double bond is from the terminal methyl carbon and the presence and position of one or more double or triple bonds in the carbon backbone, respectively [
 <xref rid="B143-vaccines-08-00468" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]. A further “ω” or “n” classification designates the position of the first double bond in the skeleton from the end opposite to the carboxy group. Accordingly, oleic acid is classified as a ω-9 (or n-9) fatty acid, while linoleic acid and 
 <italic>α</italic>-linolenic acid are ω-6 (or n-6) and ω-3 (or n-3) fatty acids, as they contain the double bond nine, six and three carbons from the methyl end [
