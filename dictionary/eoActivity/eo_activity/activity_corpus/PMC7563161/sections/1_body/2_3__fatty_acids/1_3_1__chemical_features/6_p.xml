<p>PUFA can be further classified depending on the relative positions of the double bonds, as conjugated (double-bonded carbon atoms alternate with single bonds) and unconjugated (double bonds separated by one or more single bonds) [
 <xref rid="B143-vaccines-08-00468" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]. Unconjugated PUFA, especially ω-3, ω-6, and ω-9 series, are the most occurring in nature. The most common conjugated PUFA are trienes, such as octadecatrienoic acids (e.g., punic acid, calendic acid).
