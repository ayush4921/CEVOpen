<p>The initial rate-limiting step for the biosynthesis of ω3 and ω6 fatty acids is the insertion of a further double bond at the ∆6 carbon into the carbon chain of ALA and LA, through the help of a ∆6 desaturase enzyme: stearidonic acid (SA; 6,9,12,15–18:4) and γ-linolenic acid (GLA; 6,9,12–18:3) are formed, respectively. These compounds are converted to eicosatetraenoic acid (ETA; 2,4,6,8–20:4) and dihomo γ-linolenic acid (DGLA; 8,11,14–20:3) by the elongase 5, being further converted to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 2,4,6,8,10–20:5) and arachidonic acid (AA; 5,8,11,14–20:4), by the addition of a double bond at the ∆5 position, through a ∆5 desaturase. Further elongations convert EPA and AA to docosapentaenoic acid (2,4,6,8,10–22:5) and adrenic acid (7,10,13,16–22:4); then, a desaturation by ∆6 desaturase generates docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 4,7,10,13,16,19–22:6) [

Both series of fatty acids can be further metabolized by cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase enzymes, to obtain eicosanoids, including prostaglandins, thromboxanes and leukotrienes, acting as central modulators of the inflammatory process [
