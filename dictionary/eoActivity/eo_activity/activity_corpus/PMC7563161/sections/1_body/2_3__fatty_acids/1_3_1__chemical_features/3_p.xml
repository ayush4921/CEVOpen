<p>Based on the presence of different double bonds in this structure, fatty acids can be distinguished in saturated fatty acids (SFA), lacking double bonds in their carbon backbone, and unsaturated FA (UFA), which may contain one or more double bonds, thus leading to monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) [
 <xref rid="B143-vaccines-08-00468" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]. SFA include palmitic acid (C16:0), lauric acid (C12:0), myristic acid (C14:0), and stearic acid (C18:0), whereas n-9 oleic acid (C18:1) is an example of MUFA.
