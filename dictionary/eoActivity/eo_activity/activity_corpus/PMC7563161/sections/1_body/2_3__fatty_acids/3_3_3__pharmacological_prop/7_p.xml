<p>Immunomodulatory properties of ω-6 and ω-3 PUFA have been highlighted in different preclinical models and have been associated with their ability to modulate the inflammatory process [

These fatty acids share common biosynthetic enzymes which mediate the production of different series of eicosanoids, starting from typical precursors, including dihomo-γ-linoleic acid (DGLA), arachidonic acid (AA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Among prostanoids, three types of prostaglandins (PG), including PG1, PG2 and PG3, can be obtained. PG1 is associated with beneficial effects and lower inflammation, thus being considered as an antinflammatory prostanoid; conversely, PG2 has opposite behaviour, increasing inflammation, vasoconstriction and blood clotting. PG3 acts through a mixture of functions and is able to reduce the PG2-mediated inflammation [
