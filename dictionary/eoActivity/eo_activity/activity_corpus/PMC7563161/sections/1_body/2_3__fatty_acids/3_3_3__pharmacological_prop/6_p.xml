<p>Regarding conjugated PUFA, punicic acid has been shown to improve the immune system development, stimulate the CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocyte-mediated immunity and increase the immune response against viruses [
 <xref rid="B174-vaccines-08-00468" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>]. These immune boosting effects are due to nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ- and δ-dependent mechanisms, as punicic acid is able to act as an agonist of these receptors; in support, the loss of PPARγ in immune cells impaired its effects [

Moreover, punicic acid inhibited the TNF-α-induced priming of ROS production by inhibiting the Ser345-p47phox phosphorylation and upstreaming kinase p38MAPK; likewise, it blocked the TNF-α-induced release of myeloperoxidase from neutrophils, and decreased neutrophil-activation and ROS/MPO-mediated tissue damage
