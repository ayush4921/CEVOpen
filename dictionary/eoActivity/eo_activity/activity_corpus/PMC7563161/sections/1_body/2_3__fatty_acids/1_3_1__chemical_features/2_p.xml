<p>Among them, SCFA, such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate, are produced by gut microbiota enzymes (i.e., propionate-CoA transferase and propionaldehyde dehydratase) during the metabolism of carbohydrates and peptides containing branched-chain amino acids [

 <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> are reported to be mainly responsible for the production of acetate and propionate, while 
 <italic>Firmicutes</italic> are the primary contributors of butyrate; however, other bacteria such as
