<p>AA can also be released by the cell membranes through the action of phospholipase A2 during cell injuries or changes in biomembrane composition, thus representing a physiological activator of inflammation as a defence response. AA and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) compete for the synthesis of different series of PG, mediated by cyclooxigenase, while 5-lipooxygenase (LOX) is involved in their conversion into thromboxanes and leukotrienes. Particularly, tromboxane A2 and leukotriene B4 are produced from AA, while tromboxane A3 and leukotriene B5 from EPA. EPA and DHA are also precursors of lipoxins, resolvins and protectins, which produced anti-inflammatory effects and regulate vascular tone and blood pressure [
