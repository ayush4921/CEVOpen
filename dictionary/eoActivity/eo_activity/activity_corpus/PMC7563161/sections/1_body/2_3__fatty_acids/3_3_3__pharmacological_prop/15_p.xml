<p>Conversely, Ï‰-6 PUFAs seem to promote inflammation, associated with incresead ROS levels, in neutrophils [

Particularly, linoleic acid increased the marginated pool of neutrophils in tissues by the induced expression of adhesion molecules; it also complexed with the anti-inflammatory molecule 1-antitrypsin, thus reducing LPS-induced IL-1 secretion in neutrophils [
