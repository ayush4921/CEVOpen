Based on the number of carbons in the chain, fatty acids can be classified as shortchain fatty acids (SCFA; aliphatic tails up to a maximum of six carbons), medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA; aliphatic tails of 7â€“12 carbons), long-chain fatty acids (LCFA; aliphatic tails of 13 to 21 carbons) and very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA; aliphatic tails of 22 and more carbons) [
