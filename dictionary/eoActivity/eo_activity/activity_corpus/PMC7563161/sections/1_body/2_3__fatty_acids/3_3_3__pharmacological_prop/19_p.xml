<p>The seed oil from 
 <italic>L. usitatissimum</italic>, also known as flaxseed oil, has been reported to induce immunomodulating effects, likely through suppressing cell mediated immunity, without the involvement of humoral immunity. Being a rich source of ALA, its effects are mainly ascribed to this compound, although further studies suggested a possible contribution of bioactive phenolics [

Moreover, it improved systemic and gut immunity, in a piglet model with intrauterine growth retardation: increased plasma concentration of immunoglobulin G, decreased CD3+CD8+ T lymphocytes, and the downregulation of genes expression for proinflammatory factors have been reported [
