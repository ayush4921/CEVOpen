<p>Long-chain fatty acids have been found involved in immune modulation, being able to affect both innate and adaptive response. Although specific profiles characterize each class of fatty acids, these effects are mainly ascribed to their ability to target the cell membrane, where they can be incorporated, thus changing membrane composition and fluidity and modulating membrane-protein interaction and signal transduction. Furthermore, a role in the control of inflammation has been reported. Epithelial growth factor receptors (a critical crossroad of multiple receptor pathways which is potentially implicated in the regulation of proliferation and possibly involved in atherogenesis) are considered possible targets for unsaturated fatty acids [
