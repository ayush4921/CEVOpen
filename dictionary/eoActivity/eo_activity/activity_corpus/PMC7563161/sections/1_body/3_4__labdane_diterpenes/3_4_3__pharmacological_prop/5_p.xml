 <italic>In vitro</italic>, andrographolide (the main phytoconstituent of 
 <italic>A. paniculata</italic>) can inhibit inflammation, by regulating protein expression (cytokines, chemokines) and by reducing immune cell infiltration. Andrographolide was shown to inhibit also oxidative stress by binding to adenosine A2A receptor, by inducing nuclear factor (erthroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) translocation, and by increasing the expression of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase-2 [

Moreover, it was found to exert cytotoxic/anticancer effects on almost all types of tumour cell lines (human leukemia, renal tubular epithelial cells, breast cancer cells, etc.), mainly by cell cycle arrest, autophagy, cell death, anti-inflammatory and immune system mediated effects [
