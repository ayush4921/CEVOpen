 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00468-f008">Figure 8</xref>). Labdane-related molecules have a hydrocarbon skeleton, originated from dual biosynthetic cyclization and/or rearrangement reactions, produced through the biosynthetic pathway of gibberellin phytohormones by the diterpene cyclases. The labane diterpenoids belong to a superfamily of natural products, in which the hydrocarbon skeleton might serve as privileged scaffolds for their biological activity [
