 <italic>Marrubium</italic> spp. (
 <italic>aschersonii</italic>, 
 <italic>globosum</italic>, etc.) have multiple actions, including antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities. Marrubasch A-F and marrubenol, isolated from the ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>M. aschersonii</italic>, exhibited weak reduction in iNOS activity and, consequentely, NO production [
 <xref rid="B217-vaccines-08-00468" ref-type="bibr">217</xref>]. Marrulibanoside, obtained from the aerial parts of 
 <italic>M. globosum</italic>, inhibited catalytic activity of iNOS and COX-2enzymes, and consequentely, the PEG2 and NO production.
