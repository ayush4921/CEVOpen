 <italic>A. paniculata</italic> presents numerous pharmacological properties, andrographolide possess poor solubility (principally in DMSO), which severely limits the possibility of achieving a therapeutic effect (if not properly formulated). Its better absorption could be achieved by nano-formulations (e.g., nano-emulsion, nano-capsules).
