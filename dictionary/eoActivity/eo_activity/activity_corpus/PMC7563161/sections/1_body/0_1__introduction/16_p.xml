<p>In the present review, up to date knowledge on the scientific basis for the immunomodulatory activity and clinical relevance of some emerging classes of plant-derived nutraceuticals, including polysaccharides, fatty acids and labdane diterpenes, has been reported. A comprehensive search was made using PubMed and SCOPUS electronic databases and selecting English as the preferred language, although no language limitations nor filters were applied. For more specific requirements, Google Scholar and ClinicalTrials.gov were considered too. The following searching keywords and their combinations through the Boolean logical operators were used: “herbal immunomodulators”, “phytochemicals”, “immune system”, “nutraceuticals”, “medicinal plants”, “immunomodulation”, “immune system boosters”, “immunosuppressors”, “immunoadjuvants”, “gut microbiome”, “natural occurrence”, “chemical features”, “preclinical studies”, “clinical trials”, “polysaccharides”, “echinacea”, “astragalus”, “β-glucan”, “fatty acids”, “PUFA”, “oleic acid”, “punicic acid”, “γ-linolenic acid”, “linoleic acid”, “evening primrose oil”, “borage oil”, “flaxseed oils”, “labdane diterpenes” and “andrographolide”.</p>
