<p>The best known immunostimulant species is echinacea (
 <italic>Echinacea purpurea</italic> (L.) Moench, 
 <italic>E. pallida</italic> Nutt. and 
 <italic>E. angustifolia</italic> DC), characterized by immunostimulant properties on both innate and adaptive response, associated with antiviral, antinflammatory and antimicrobial effects [

 <xref rid="B43-vaccines-08-00468" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The immune boosting properties of echinacea, particularly as enhancers of macrophage and lymphocyte activation, have also been highlighted in clinical studies; however, further high-quality studies are required for better characterizing the possible usefulness of echinacea byproducts as immunomodulators [
