<p>Immune response is mediated by a first line of defence, namely innate immunity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-08-00468-f001">Figure 1</xref>), which is characterized by physical and biochemical barriers, alongside a non-specific cell-mediated immune response, including granulocytes, macrophages, natural killer cells and humoral elements, which cooperate to counteract pathogen infection and malignant transformation [

Moreover, an adaptive immunity is activated as a second defense line after a macrophage-mediated presentation of antigens to B lymphocytes, with the help of T lymphocytes; then, B cells can mediate the humoral immunity through the production of high-affinity antibodies and establish immunological memory [
