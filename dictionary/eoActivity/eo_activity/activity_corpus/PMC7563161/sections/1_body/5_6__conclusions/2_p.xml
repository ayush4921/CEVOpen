<p>In this review, we highlighted the scientific evidence about the immunomodulating properties of three emerging classes of nutraceuticals, including polysaccharides, fatty acids and labdane diterpenes. Some of them, especially polysaccharides and labdane diterpenes, act as immune system booster, while fatty acids (MUFA and PUFA) mainly act as immunosuppressor, although punicic acid (a conjugate PUFA) exhibited immunostimulant properties. To date, these products are mainly used as well-tolerated food supplements, although the clinical evidence about their modulation of the immune functions is still limited. More investigations of better quality and specificity could strengthen the validity of using these plant-derived nutraceuticals in the immune system modulation.</p>
