    "<h4>Purpose of review</h4>The olive tree (Olea europaea L.) has featured as a significant part of medicinal history, used to treat a variety of ailments within folk medicine. The Mediterranean diet, which is rich in olive products, is testament to Olea europaeas positive effects on health, associated with reduced incidences of cancer and cardiovascular disease. This review aims to summarise the current literature regarding the therapeutic potential of Olea europaea products in cancer, detailing the possible compounds responsible for its chemotherapeutic effects.<h4>Recent findings</h4>Much of the existing research has focused on the use of cell culture models of disease, demonstrating Olea europaea extracts, and specific compounds within these extracts, have efficacy in a range of in vitro and in vivo cancer models. The source of Olea europaeas cytotoxicity is yet to be fully defined; however, compounds such as oleuropein and verbascoside have independent cytotoxic effects on animal models of cancer. Initial results from animal models are promising but need to be translated to a clinical setting. Treatments utilising these compounds are likely to be well tolerated and represent a promising direction for future research."
