<p id="Par17">The concentration of polyphenols in olive products can depend on factors including climate, cultivation, maturity, rootstock, agricultural practices and the method of extraction, separation and quantification [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. It was observed by Wang and Fordham [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] that the phenolic content of olives is season dependent, with olives harvested in the autumn having a higher polyphenol and carotenoid content, and therefore, a higher antioxidant capacity. Pereira [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] highlighted that black olives present a higher antioxidant capacity than their green counterpart, due to higher concentrations of phenolic compounds in black olives. Thus, the different variety of olives and processing result in polyphenol content varying significantly in different olives and consequently olive oil. Research studying the olive leaves has observed notable variety and quantity of polyphenols compared with olive oil, notably oleuropein and hydroxytyrosol [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Just as with olives, the chemical composition of olive leaves changes under conditions such as climate, country of origin, moisture, storage condition and soil content [
