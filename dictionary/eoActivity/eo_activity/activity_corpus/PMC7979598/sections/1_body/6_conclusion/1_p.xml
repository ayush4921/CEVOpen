<p id="Par32">Interest in 
 <italic>Olea europaea</italic> products is increasingly researched for their beneficial effect on human health. The polyphenols detected in these products are of growing interest due to their effect on ROS production. However, this is not their only means of inhibiting cell proliferation in cancer. Natural plant polyphenols have demonstrated the ability to alter the level of ROS, either protecting biomolecules from oxidative damage (e.g., luteolin-7-O-glucoside) or inducing oxidative damage (e.g., maslinic acid). Oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol and triterpenoids are abundant in 
 <italic>Olea europaea</italic> products. These polyphenolic compounds demonstrate powerful anti-oxidant, anti-angiogenic, chemotherapeutic and anti-inflammatory characteristics. Despite the continued positive results from in vitro studies on the beneficial properties of 
 <italic>Olive europaea</italic> products, further in vivo investigation is needed. Initial results in animal models are promising but need to be translated to clinical setting. Treatments utilising these compounds are likely to be well tolerated, as initial animal experimentation has demonstrated [
