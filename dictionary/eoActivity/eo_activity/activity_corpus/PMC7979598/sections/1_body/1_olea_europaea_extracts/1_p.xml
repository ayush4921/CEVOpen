<p id="Par12">The preponderance of research in this field has focussed on the use of cell culture models of disease, with efficacy in a range of these cancer models. Fares et al

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] studied the effect of olive leaf extract (OLE) on human lymphoblastic leukaemia cell line, Jurkat. The results reported a 78% inhibition of Jurkat cell proliferation at a concentration of 4 μg/mL at 48 hours. However, the study could not elucidate the mechanism of apoptosis. OLE has demonstrated efficacy against the myelogenous leukaemic cell line, K562. After a 72-h treatment with 150 μg/mL of OLE, the cell proliferation was inhibited to 17%, whilst also demonstrating a significant decrease in viability [
