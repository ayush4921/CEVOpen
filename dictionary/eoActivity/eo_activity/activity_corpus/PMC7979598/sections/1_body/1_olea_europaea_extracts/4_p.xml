<p id="Par15">Whilst the source of cytotoxicity of OLE has yet to be fully defined, oleuropein is the most abundant compound in olive leaves, followed by hydroxytyrosol, luteolin, apigenin and verbascoside. Oleuropein is a heterosidic ester of elenolic acid and dihydroxyphenylethanol. Hydroxytyrosol (3,4-Dihydroxyphenyl ethanol), is the principal degradation product of oleuropein [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This change in concentration takes place due to chemical and enzymatic reaction that occurs during maturation of olive products or as a result of processing. One key component of olives and olive oil is their fatty acid composition. Olive oil largely consists of triacylglycerols (98-99%), a group of glycerol esters with varying fatty acids [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The main fatty acid in olive oil is oleic acid; however, it also contains linoleic acid, palmitic acid, palmitoleic acid, stearic acid and the triterpene maslinic acid. A variety of amphiphilic and lipophilic microconstituents exist in olive oil including, tocopherols, squalene, phytosterols, and phenolic compounds [
