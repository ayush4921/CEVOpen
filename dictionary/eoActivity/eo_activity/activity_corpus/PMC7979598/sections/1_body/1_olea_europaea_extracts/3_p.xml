In this study, OLE was mixed with either deionised water or 80% methanol, and these extracts were subsequently tested individually in a dose- and time-dependent manner on the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7. After a 48-h treatment, the deionised water extract had an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 182 μg/mL whilst the methanol extract was 135 μg/mL, versus relevant controls. Furthermore, the source of the products are often not comparable, something which is supported by in vivo studies. For example, a study by Escrich, Moral and Solana [

Olive oil induced molecular changes in tumours that resulted in higher rates of apoptosis, lower proliferation and lower DNA damage. Furthermore, Milanizadeh and Reza Bigdeli [

This reduced growth was proposed to be related to the polyphenol content of OLE, resulting in an increase of antioxidant enzyme activity including superoxide dismutase and catalase. The mechanisms responsible for inhibited tumour growth are likely to stem from OLE polyphenols blocking the cell cycle in G1/S through reducing COX2 and cyclin D1 expression, which results in the reduction of cell growth and proliferation [
