 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] observed the cytotoxic effect of extra virgin olive oil extract on two different bladder cancer cell lines. It was demonstrated that oil significantly decreased proliferation in T24 and 5637 bladder cell lines in a dose dependent manner. Cell viability of T24 cells was decreased by up to 90% with 100 μg/mL oil, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of ~32 μg/mL, with similar treatment efficacy in 5637 cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, the cell cycle progression was monitored by flow cytometry, that observed a growth arrest at the G2/M phase after treatment in both cell lines. In the T24 cell line, a decrease was observed in the G0/G1 phase and an increase in the sub-G1 fraction, indicative of induction of apoptosis. Western blot analysis of pro-caspase-3, -9 and PARP-1 further demonstrated an apoptotic effect of oil [

 <italic>.</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>•] tested this wastewater on PC-3 prostate cancer cells in culture. The results demonstrated wastewater was able to inhibit cell proliferation, adhesion, migration and invasion. At a molecular level, the wastewater was observed to inhibit NF-κB signalling in addition to reducing pro-angiogenic growth factors, VEGF, CXCL-8 and CXCL-12 production. The results demonstrated that even from the lowest dilution tested (1:5000), wastewater was able to inhibit PC-3 cell proliferation [
