<p id="Par26">Hydroxytyrosol was revealed to possess antibacterial, antioxidative, and anti-inflammatory properties [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Evidence further demonstrated effective chemotherapeutic properties through affecting several signalling pathways [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]; notably growth factor receptors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>], receptor support proteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>] and interleukin pathways [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Inhibition of cyclin D1 is core to hydroxytyrosol efficacy, resulting in cell cycle arrest at G1/S phase in the MCF-7 cell line [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Several studies have referenced cyclin D1 downregulation following hydroxytyrosol treatment in many cancer cell lines, including breast cancer (MCF-7, MB231) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>], colon cancer (Caco-2) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>], and thyroid cancer (TPC-1, FB-2, WRO) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>].
