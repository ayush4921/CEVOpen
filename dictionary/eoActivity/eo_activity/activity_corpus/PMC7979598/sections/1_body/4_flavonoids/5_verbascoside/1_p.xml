<p id="Par29">Verbascoside has demonstrated anti-tumour effects in some human cancers. Apoptosis promotion by verbascoside is associated with HIPK2, p53, HIF-1Î± and Rac-1 in colorectal cancer cell lines [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>], in addition to downregulation of STAT3, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers (vimentin, snail and zeb1) and c-Met in glioblastomas [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>] further demonstrated the downregulation of the EMT markers and c-Met in an orthotopic glioblastoma xenograft mouse model. EMT is a fundamental hallmark of metastatic tumourigenesis and has an essential role in glioma aggressiveness [

 <italic>.</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>] highlighted that verbascoside can bind directly to the c-Met protein, and that verbascoside causes c-Met protein degradation through the ubiquitination-proteasome pathway. Furthermore, verbascoside was able to suppress tumour growth and enhance survival in mice [
