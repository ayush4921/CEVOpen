The study revealed hydroxytyrosol inhibited cyclins D1/E and cyclin-dependent kinases cdk2/4 and induced the cell cycle inhibitors p21/p27, resulting in G1/S cell cycle arrest [

Phosphorylation of Akt/STAT3 was inhibited and cytoplasmic retention of NF-kB was induced, which relates to the induction of apoptosis. Prostate cancers usually retain androgen receptor signalling and are normally dependent on activated Akt, NF-kB, and STAT3 signalling [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>] demonstrated that hydroxytyrosol significantly downregulates epidermal growth factor receptor expression in human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (HT-29, WiDr and CaCo2). They concluded that hydroxytyrosol downregulated receptor expression through proteasomal and lysosomal degradation via receptor ubiquitination. This led Terzuoli et al
