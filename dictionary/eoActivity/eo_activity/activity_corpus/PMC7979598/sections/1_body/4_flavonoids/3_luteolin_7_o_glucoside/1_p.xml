Balb/c mice were injected with 10 mg/kg of cisplatin following luteolin-7-O-glucoside treatment (40 mg/kg). The results demonstrated that luteolin-7-O-glucoside attenuates the genotoxicity associated with cisplatin [

This included a reduction in markers of tissue damage (creatinine, interferon γ) and oxidative stress (malondialdehyde, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione). Work on the liver cancer cell line HepG2 demonstrated that exposure to luteolin 7-glucoside and apigenin 7-glucoside reduced cell viability, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 21 μg/mL and 17 μg/mL, respectively. These compounds reduced the expression of NF-κB, a key pathway in the chronic inflammation associated with hepatocellular carcinoma [
