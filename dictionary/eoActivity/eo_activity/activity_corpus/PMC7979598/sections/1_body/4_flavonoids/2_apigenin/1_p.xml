<p id="Par24">A recent study investigated the anti-proliferative effects of apigenin, an abundant flavonoid, on the human cervical cancer cell line HeLa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Initial research demonstrated an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 15 μM – similar to that observed for some common chemotherapeutics. Reduced viability was associated with an apoptotic profile as determined by annexin V and propidium iodide positivity. This was demonstrated by Western blot where apigenin increased the expression of Bax and decreased the expression of Bcl-2, commonly observed in apoptosis. The authors concluded that apigenin has apparent potential as a chemotherapeutic agent [

In a dose-dependent manner, apigenin inhibited PC3 and cancer stem cell survival, that was associated with PI3K, AKT and NF-κB downregulation, and increases in p27 and p21. Apigenin significantly suppressed the migration rate of CD44+ cancer stem cells, as determined by a wound healing assay. This supressed migration was through downregulation of matrix metallopeptidases-2, -9, Snail and Slug. Thus, Erdogan et al

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] demonstrated apigenin to suppress colorectal cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion through the inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway. The occurrence of human tumorigenesis can be significantly affected by abnormal activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway. Xu et al

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] demonstrated antiproliferation effects of apigenin on HCT15 and SW480 colorectal cancer cell lines in vitro. It was determined that apigenin significantly reduced HCT15 and SW480 cell proliferation at an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 23.57 μM and 18.17 μM, respectively.
