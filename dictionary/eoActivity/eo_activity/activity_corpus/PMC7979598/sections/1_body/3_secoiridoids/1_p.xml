<p id="Par19">Secoiridoids are uniquely present in plants of Olearaceae family [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Secoiridoids are monoterpenoids based on the 7,8-secocyclopenta[c]-pyranoid skeleton. In plants, it is possible that they derive from iridoids that are cleaved with redox enzymes and subsequently undergo several secondary modifications (oxidation, epoxidation, esterification) of the generated hydroxyl groups within the main skeleton. This produces a group of compounds, which constitute the class [
