<p id="Par21">Numerous studies have demonstrated oleuropeins efficacy against certain breast cancer cell lines. Sirianni et al
 <italic>.</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] demonstrated the inhibition of estradiol-dependent activation of extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2) by oleuropein in the MCF-7 cell line. This is significant as estradiol stimulates the growth of several breast tumours, through induced cellular proliferation. It is established that oleuropein can reduce cell proliferation of MCF-7 and T47D cells, this reduce proliferation is associated with the activation of autophagy and suppression of migration and invasion; this is achieved through p62 downregulation, in addition to Beclin-1 and LC3II/LC3I upregulation [

 <italic>.</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], treated breast cancer xenografts (in nude mice) 
 <italic>in vivo,</italic> with a combination of doxorubicin and oleuropein. This treatment combination resulted in a downregulation of NF-κB, Bcl-2 and survivin, triggering apoptosis. All treatments significantly reduced tumour volume compared to untreated controls (tumour volume, 173mm
 <sup>3</sup>). However, combination therapy of doxorubicin and oleuropein (48.7mm
 <sup>3</sup>) had greater efficacy than either doxorubicin (69mm
 <sup>3</sup>) or oleuropein (79mm
 <sup>3</sup>) alone. Oleuropein has further demonstrated efficacy in numerous cancer cell lines such as colorectal, thyroid and lung [
