<p id="Par22">Studies have outlined the potential of oleocanthal for cancer prevention in many cancer types. Akl et al
 <italic>.</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] demonstrated that oleocanthal can inhibit the growth of human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and BT-474, whilst not affecting normal human cell growth of MCF10A. Possible mechanisms of action in these cell lines point to the blocking of cell migration, invasion and G1/S cell cycle progression. This mechanism occurs through the inhibition of Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-induced c-Met activation [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. This study demonstrated that oleocanthal did not produce significant changes in human dermal fibroblast viability, signifying selective activity for cancer cells over normal cells. This selectivity has been associated with oleocanthals ability to induce lysosomal membrane permeabilization leading to apoptosis and/or necrosis. Cancer cells largely have weak lysosomal membranes compared to noncancerous cells, thus making them susceptible to cell death via lysosomotropic agents [

 <italic>.</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] demonstrated oleocanthal induced cell growth inhibition in 501Mel and A375 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 13.6 and 20 Î¼M respectively. It was demonstrated that oleocanthal downregulates Bcl-2, Erk1/2 and AKT signal transduction pathways [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. These pathways play a key role in oleocanthal-induced cytotoxicity in multiple myeloma cells. Moreover, the activation of the AKT pathway is closely associated with resistance to BRAF inhibitors in melanoma patients [
