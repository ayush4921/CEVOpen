<p id="Par30">Triterpenoids are structurally varied organic compounds, made of a basic backbone modified in a multitude of ways, creating the formation of over 20,000 naturally occurring triterpenoids [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. Triterpenoids are characterised by 30 carbon atoms, polymerised to form six isoprene units. Biosynthesis of triterpenoids occurs when its precursor squalene undergoes cyclization. Triterpenoids chemical structure is grouped from linear, through to pentacyclic [
