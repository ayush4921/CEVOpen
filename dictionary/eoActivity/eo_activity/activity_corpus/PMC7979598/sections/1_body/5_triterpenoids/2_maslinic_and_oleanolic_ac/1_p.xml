These compounds were examined for their effect on proliferation, necrosis and apoptosis. Maslinic acid inhibited cell growth with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 101.2 μM, whilst oleanolic acid demonstrated lesser antiproliferation activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 160.6 μM. Maslinic acid increased caspase-3-like activity that was associated with increased presence of mitochondrial ROS, whereas oleanolic acid cytotoxicity was not associated with either activated caspase-3 or ROS production [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>•] investigated oleanolic acid-induced cancer cell death, apoptotic mechanisms, cell cycle status, and MAPK kinase signalling in MCF-7, DU145 (prostate cancer) and U87 (human glioblastoma) cell lines. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for oleanolic acid-induced cytotoxicity were 132.29 in MCF-7, 112.57 in DU145 and 163.60 in U87 cells. At 100 μg/mL oleanolic acid, there was an increased number of apoptotic cells to 27.0% in MCF-7, 27.0% in DU145 and 15.7% in U87, when compared to control cells [

Furthermore, the different cancer lines arrested at varying phases of the cell cycle, MCF-7 and U87 cells arrested in G1, whereas DU145 cells arrested in G2 [
