<p id="Par11">Academic studies of the beneficial properties of olives initiated in 1854 with the work of Daniel Hanbury, who noted that a decoction of olive leaf was effective in reducing fevers associated with malaria [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Many pharmacological reports have since exhibited the potential of olive-based extracts to relieve arrhythmia, increase blood flow, lower blood pressure, inhibit viral activity and prevent intestinal muscle spasms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Scientific studies looking at the anti-proliferative components of certain flora, have recently demonstrated this potential within 
 <italic>Olea europaea</italic> products, largely from in vitro studies using extracts in addition to testing isolated compounds from 
 <italic>Olea europaea</italic> products [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This review will summarise the key studies that relate to 
 <italic>Olea europaea</italic> extractâ€™s anti-cancer effects and discuss compounds chosen for their high abundance within 
 <italic>Olea europaea</italic>, revealing their anti-proliferation properties.
