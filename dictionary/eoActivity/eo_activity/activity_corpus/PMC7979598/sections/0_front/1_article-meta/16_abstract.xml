  <title>Purpose of Review</title>
  <p id="Par1">The olive tree (
   <italic>Olea europaea</italic> L.) has featured as a significant part of medicinal history, used to treat a variety of ailments within folk medicine. The Mediterranean diet, which is rich in olive products, is testament to 
   <italic>Olea europaeas</italic> positive effects on health, associated with reduced incidences of cancer and cardiovascular disease. This review aims to summarise the current literature regarding the therapeutic potential of 
   <italic>Olea europaea</italic> products in cancer, detailing the possible compounds responsible for its chemotherapeutic effects.

  <title>Recent Findings</title>
  <p id="Par2">Much of the existing research has focused on the use of cell culture models of disease, demonstrating 
   <italic>Olea europaea</italic> extracts, and specific compounds within these extracts, have efficacy in a range of in vitro and in vivo cancer models. The source of 
   <italic>Olea europaeas</italic> cytotoxicity is yet to be fully defined; however, compounds such as oleuropein and verbascoside have independent cytotoxic effects on animal models of cancer.

  <title>Summary</title>
  <p id="Par3">Initial results from animal models are promising but need to be translated to a clinical setting. Treatments utilising these compounds are likely to be well tolerated and represent a promising direction for future research.</p>
