<p>Production in agricultural systems requires cultivars with high quality bioactive compounds, high yields of essential oil and vegetative herbage, uniform germination, and resistance to biotic and abiotic environmental stresses. To date, three commercial cultivars (Saturn, Compacta, and Aromata) have been modified and registered in Poland and Germany [

However, the environmental conditions of the plant habitats have played an important role in the development of different chemotypes, which can lead to the gradual emergence of a specific chemical type with a genetic basis [
