<p>Primary metabolites such as nucleic acids, amino acids, proteins, carbohydrates, antioxidative enzymes, and fatty acids are essential for plant growth and survival [
 <xref rid="B21-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Produced during photosynthesis, they participate in the production of cellular compounds. In addition, plants synthesize a wide range of chemical compounds known as secondary metabolites (SMs) during their interactions with the environment, especially in response to biotic and abiotic stresses [
 <xref rid="B22-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Based on their biosynthetic pathways and chemical structure, SMs are classified into different types (e.g. terpenoids, alkaloids, phenolics, flavonoids, and steroids), and are widely used in the pharmaceutical, food, cosmetic, and agrochemical industries [

 <xref rid="B24-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The most important SMs are polyphenols, also called phenolic compounds, which are natural plant antioxidants. To date, approximately ten thousand phenolic compounds have been identified and isolated from plant taxa [
