<p>The main system for free radical scavenging and the regeneration of damaged cells in the body involves antioxidants, which curb the effect of free radical molecules [

The primary antioxidants, called chain-breaking antioxidative compounds, react directly with lipid radicals and convert them into relatively stable products by supplying a hydrogen atom (H

 <xref rid="B15-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The other group, known as secondary antioxidants, can reduce the rate of oxidation, mainly by binding metal ions, and are able to catalyze oxidation by oxygen scavenging, absorbing UV radiation, and inhibiting enzymes [
 <xref rid="B15-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Antioxidant enzymes (e.g., catalase, glutathione peroxidases, ascorbate peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase), vitamins (e.g., vitamin C, vitamin E, and β-carotene), extracellular proteins (e.g., albumin, transferrin, lactoferrin, haptoglobin, and ceruloplasmin), and other cellular compounds (e.g., quinones, glutathione, uric acid, and bilirubin) form the antioxidant defense system in the human body [
