<p>Alzheimer’s patients are known to have amyloid-β plaques in their brain, so there is considerable interest in finding a way of preventing the aggregation of these peptides. The use of orally administered RA has proved to be effective in inhibiting different pathways leading to the formation of these plaques [

 <xref rid="B89-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>] showed that low concentrations of RA exerted a protective effect on neurons against one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Additionally, using mice as an animal model, Kim et al. [
 <xref rid="B90-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>] showed that RA inhibited angiogenesis on the retinal surface, by impeding the growth of retinal endothelial cells. In an in vitro angiogenesis test, RA also inhibited the formation of tube-like structures characteristic of this pathological vascularization.
