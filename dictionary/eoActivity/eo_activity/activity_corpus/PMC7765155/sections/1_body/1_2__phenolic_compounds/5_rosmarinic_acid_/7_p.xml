<p>The two intermediary precursors (pHPL and 4-coumaroyl-CoA) are coupled by ester formation to 4-coumaroyl-4’-hydroxyphenyllactic acid (4C-pHPL), with release of coenzyme A. The condensation reaction is catalysed by 4-coumaroyl-CoA:4’-hydroxyphenyllactic (CHPL) acid 4-coumaroyltransferase from the BAHD acyltransferase family, commonly referred to as rosmarinic acid synthase (RAS). RAS transfers the 4-coumaroyl moiety to the aliphatic OH-group of pHPL (
