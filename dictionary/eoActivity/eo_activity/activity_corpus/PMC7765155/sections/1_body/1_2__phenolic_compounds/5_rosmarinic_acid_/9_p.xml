<p>The conversion of hydroxypyruvate to glycerate by either a NADH-dependent peroxisomal hydroxypyruvate reductase (HPR) or a cytosolic NADPH-dependent HPR2 during photorespiration [
 <xref rid="B76-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] resembles the stereospecific reduction of pHPP by HPPR. In fact, HPR2 from 
 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> heterologously expressed in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> accepted hydroxyphenylpyruvate as a substrate, even though 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> does not biosynthesize RA [
 <xref rid="B66-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. It is currently under investigation whether HPRR is related to cytosolic HPR and if it should be regarded as a key enzyme in RA synthesis.
