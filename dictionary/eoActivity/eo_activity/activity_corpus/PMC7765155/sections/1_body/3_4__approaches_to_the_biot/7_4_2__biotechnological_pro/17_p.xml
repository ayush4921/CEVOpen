<p>Although the elicitation conditions and the age of the cell line were different, when comparing the biomass and RA production, both biotechnological systems, the wave-mixed and the orbitally shaken bag, showed that biotechnological platforms based on 
 <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic> cell suspensions are effective systems for the biosustainable production of this antioxidant. In both cases the growth rate and maximum RA production was higher at bioreactor level than in shake flasks.
