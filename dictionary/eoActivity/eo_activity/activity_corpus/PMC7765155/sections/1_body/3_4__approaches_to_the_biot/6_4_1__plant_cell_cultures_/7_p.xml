<p>In plant cell cultures an elicitor can be defined as a factor that promotes the biosynthesis of secondary compounds with phytoalexinic activities. Classically, elicitors have been classified in two types, abiotic or biotic, according to their chemical nature and their exogenous or endogenous origin [
 <xref rid="B147-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. Several elicitors, such as yeast extract (YE), methyl jasmonate (MeJA), salicylic acid (SA), and 
 <italic>Pythium aphanidermatum</italic> extracts, have been used to enhance the RA production in in vitro cultures, and their effects have been reviewed [
 <xref rid="B83-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Mizukami et al. [
 <xref rid="B148-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>] achieved very good results, increasing RA production up to 10-fold, by eliciting cell suspensions of 
 <italic>L. erythrohizon</italic> with 100 μM of MeJA. More recently, Khojasteh et al. [
 <xref rid="B54-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] showed the positive effect of MeJA in cell cultures of 
 <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic>, achieving a production of 245 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup> DW after a week of elicitation. Abiotic elicitors such as vanadyl sulphate have been successfully applied to increase RA production in cell cultures of 
 <italic>Lavandula vera</italic> MM [
 <xref rid="B149-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>]. Consequently, it is possible to infer that elicitation is an effective strategy for increasing the RA production in cell cultures, as reported for other secondary compounds. Some examples of the effect of elicitors on RA production are summarized in 
 <xref rid="antioxidants-09-01273-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. These studies also show that there exists a positive relationship between RA production and the expression level of the main genes involved in its biosynthetic pathway.
