<p>Disposable mist bioreactor systems are based on a disposable bag in which a mesh matrix can immobilize cells and support biomass growth. Nutrient mist reactors are gas-phase reactors that periodically provide in vitro plants with small droplets (0.01–1 μm) of culture medium. These bioreactors are preferred for propagating plant organ cultures such as embryogenic or hairy root cultures. The use of such temporary immersion systems reduces tissue hyperhydricity. Vitrification has been classically associated with a complete or partial immersion of plant tissues in liquid medium [
