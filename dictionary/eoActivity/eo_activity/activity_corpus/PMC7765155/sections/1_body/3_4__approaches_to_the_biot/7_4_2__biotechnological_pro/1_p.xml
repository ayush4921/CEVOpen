<p>The last step in the development of a biotechnological process for producing phytochemicals is the scale-up from the laboratory to bioreactor level, while ensuring identical process characteristics [

 <xref rid="antioxidants-09-01273-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Plant cells have a diameter of 20–50 μm and a length of 100–500 μm, so are significantly larger than bacterial (&lt;1 μm diameter) and fungal (5–10 μm diameter and &lt;100 μm length) cells, with intracellular vacuoles that occupy up to 90% of cell volume. For this reason, they can be considered as “bags of water with thin cell walls” [
