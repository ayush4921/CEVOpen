<p>Ectopic expression of AtPAP1 increases the accumulation of anthocyanins in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01273-f008">Figure 8</xref>), in a later experiment, the same authors increased the biosynthesis of phenolic precursors by the ectopic expression of AtPAP1 and simultaneously decreased lignin biosynthesis via co-supression of two key enzymes involved in this process, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (SmCCR) and caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (SmCOMT), using chimeric RNAi technology. The obtained transgenic plants accumulated significantly higher levels of RA than the control plants, showing the suitability of this strategy to increase phenolic compounds such as RA.
