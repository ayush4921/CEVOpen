<p>The first high RA production in cell suspension cultures was reported in sage (
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic>) by Hippolyte et al. [
 <xref rid="B137-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. The growth capacity and production of RA by these cells were modified by the culture conditions, leading to a 10-fold increase in RA production, and attaining 6.4 g/L under optimal conditions. Suspension cultures of 
 <italic>C. blumei</italic> accumulated high amounts of RA in a medium with elevated sucrose concentrations [
 <xref rid="B138-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. Sucrose levels also affected RA production in cell suspension cultures of 
 <italic>Anthoceros agrestis</italic> Paton: 2 and 4% sucrose were used, and cell suspensions achieved up to 5.1% dry weight (DW) of RA at day 8 in the medium supplemented with the lower concentration of sucrose [
 <xref rid="B139-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. In contrast, 7% sucrose was the optimal concentration for increasing RA production in cell cultures of 
 <italic>L. vera</italic> [
 <xref rid="B140-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. Sugar-feeding experiments have also been carried out in callus cultures of 
 <italic>Zataria multiflora</italic>, and the best source of sugar was 75 g glucose L
 <sup>−1</sup> culture medium, when the callus achieved 158.26 mg RA g DW
 <sup>−1</sup>, a content 13-fold higher than the maximum reached in in vitro micropropagated shoot cultures [
