<p>Coronatine (COR) is a pathogenic toxin produced by 
 <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> that has been tested as an elicitor in plant cell cultures of 
 <italic>T. media</italic> and 
 <italic>T. globosa</italic> [

 <xref rid="B186-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">186</xref>]. It acts as a molecular stimulator of the isoleucine-conjugated form of jasmonic acid (JA-Ile), but being more stable, its mechanism of action is similar to that of the elicitor MeJA [
 <xref rid="B187-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">187</xref>]. The addition of COR to cell cultures of 
 <italic>T. media</italic> and 
 <italic>T. globosa</italic> was more effective than MeJA in increasing taxane production, even at much lower concentrations. The taxane yields reached in 
 <italic>Taxus</italic> spp. cell cultures treated with COR have been up to 5.3 times higher than those obtained with MeJA [

 <xref rid="B186-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">186</xref>]. COR has also been successfully utilized to improve RA production in 
 <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic> cell cultures. As COR significantly reduced the DW, the productivity of RA initially also decreased significantly after the elicitation. However, at day 21 (168 h after elicitation), the RA production levels of COR-treated cells started to overtake those of the control cells, reaching more than 2600 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup> after 240 h, which was significantly higher than the control (untreated cells) [
