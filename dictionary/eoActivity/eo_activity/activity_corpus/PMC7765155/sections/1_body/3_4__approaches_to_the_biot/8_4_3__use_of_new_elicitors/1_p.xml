<p>Several elicitor treatments have been used to improve the biotechnological production of RA (

 <xref rid="B181-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">181</xref>]. CD have attracted considerable interest recently, because they can act as really elicitors increasing the production of plant secondary metabolites and not only provoking the release of the target compounds to the culture medium.
