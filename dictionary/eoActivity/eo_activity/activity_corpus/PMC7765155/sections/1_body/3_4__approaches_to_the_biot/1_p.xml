<p>The high demand for many medicinal plants has led to massive overharvesting and many of them have become endangered species in their original habitats. An important challenge for plant biotechnology is to find alternative sources of biologically active SMs. Biotechnological platforms based on plant cell cultures have been successfully developed for several medicinal plant species [

 <xref rid="B128-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]. Among the methods used to improve the biotechnological production of SMs are screening and selection of highly productive cell lines, as well as the optimization of culture conditions and induction of secondary metabolism by the use of elicitors [
