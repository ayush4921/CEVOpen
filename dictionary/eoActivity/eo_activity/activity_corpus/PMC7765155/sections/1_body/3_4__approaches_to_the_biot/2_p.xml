<p>Currently, it is potentially possible to induce callus cultures from practically all plant species, although some species are more recalcitrant. Mineral nutrient composition, the type and concentration of plant growth regulators, as well as the source of explants are factors to be considered in callus induction (

As growth and secondary metabolism are often antagonistic processes due to competition for the same precursors, in biotechnological processes it is often necessary to change conditions optimal for growth to achieve high productivity of the target compound. The use of biosynthetic precursors and elicitors are widely used strategies for this purpose.
