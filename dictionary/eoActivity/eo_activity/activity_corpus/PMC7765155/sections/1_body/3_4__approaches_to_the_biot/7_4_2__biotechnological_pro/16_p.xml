<p>Regarding 
 <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic>, two attempts have been carried out for the biotechnological production of RA in cell cultures of this plant species. In the first one, a wave-mixed bioreactor with a 1L working volume was utilized for a culture period of 21 days, eliciting the cells with 100 μM MeJa. In these conditions, a biomass productivity of 18.7 g L
 <sup>−1</sup> d
 <sup>−1</sup> with a maximum RA production of 3.1 g L
 <sup>−1</sup> was achieved, demonstrating the suitability of this biotechnological platform for the production of this plant antioxidant [
 <xref rid="B54-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In a second attempt with the same cell line, a 2 L bag with a working volume of 1 L, shaken in a Khuner orbital shaker in the dark at 25 °C and 35–38 rpm, with a shaking diameter of 50 mm, was used. In this case, the elicitor treatment with 1 μM coronatine significantly increased the RA production capacity, achieving a specific production of 338.2 mg g DW
 <sup>−1</sup> at day 16, which was 1.7 times higher than in control conditions (untreated cells).
