<p>Disposable wave-mixed bioreactors are composed of an inflated pre-sterilized plastic bag that forms a disposable cell cultivation chamber containing the culture medium and cells. The bag is fixed on an electrically driven rocking unit, whose movement induces a wave, which introduces bubble-free oxygen into the culture medium from the headspace of the bag, and the surface of the medium is continuously renewed. The wave movement sweeps up cells and prevents them from settling in the bioreactor. It also positively influences the mass transfer and reduces shear stress on cells, and thus supports cell growth and product formation [
