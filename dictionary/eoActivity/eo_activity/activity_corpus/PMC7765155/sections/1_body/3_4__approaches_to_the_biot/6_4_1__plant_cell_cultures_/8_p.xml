<p>Combining the effects of elicitation with feeding experiments has achieved successful results. The effects of different concentrations of sucrose, phenylalanine, and the elicitors YE and MeJA at several concentrations were tested with 
 <italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic> cell suspension cultures. Production of RA reached a maximum when the culture medium was supplemented with sucrose at 5.0%, phenylalanine at 0.25 g L
 <sup>−1</sup> and the elicitor MeJA [

 <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic> cell cultures, 3.0 mM phenylalanine reduced the growth capacity of the cultures but enhanced RA production of cells, achieving a content of 227.76 mg RA g
