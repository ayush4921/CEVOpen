<p>The fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) composition was determined by converting the oil to fatty acidmethyl esters by addition of 1 mL of n-hexane to 40 mg of oil followed by 200 µL of sodium methoxide (2 M). The mixture is heated in the bath at 50 °C for a few seconds followed by adding 200 µL HCl (2 N). The top layer (1 µL) was injected onto a GC (Agilent 6890N, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a polarcapillary column (HP-Innowax polyethylene glycol, 0.25 mm internal diameter, 30 min length and 0.25 µm film in thickness) to obtain individual peaks of fatty acid methyl esters. The detector temperature was 275 °C and the column temperature was 150 °C held for min and increased at the rate of 15 °C/min to 200 °C and the rate of 2 °C/min to 250 °C and held for 4min. The run time was 45 min. The fatty acid methyl esters peaks were identified comparing their retention times with individual standard FAME (approximately 99% pure purchased from Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA) and analyzed with the Agilent Technologies Chemstation A09.01 Software. The relative percentage of the fatty acid was calculated on the basis of the peak area of a fatty acid species to the total peak area of all the fatty acids in the oil sample. Fatty acid methyl esters peak identification was confirmed by GC-MS (NIST 2002 database) operating under similar conditions as used for the GC-FID.</p>
