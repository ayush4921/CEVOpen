<p>The 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> seed oil of the MD population was incorporated into melted agar at a desired final concentration and mixed well. Stock solution of 100 mg/mL was prepared by dissolving 5 g of oil with 0.5 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and diluted up to 50 mL with distilled water. The serial dilution method (1/2
 <sup>n</sup>) from the prepared stock solution was used to prepare nine different concentrations: D1, 500 µL oil/500 µL DMSO; D2, 250 µL oil/750 µL DMSO; D3, 125 µL oil/875 µL DMSO; D4, 62.5 µL oil/937.5 µL DMSO; D5, 31.25 µL oil/968.75 µL DMSO; D6, 15.62 µL oil/984.38 µL DMSO; D7, 7.81 µL oil/992.19 µL DMSO; D8, 3.9 µL oil/996.1 µL DMSO; and D9, 1.95 µL oil/998.05 µL DMSO. The negative control was DMSO (1%). Mycelia disks (0.7-mm diameter), from five-day-old cultures, of the isolates used were deposited in the center of the plates. Mycelium growth was measured after 48, 72 and 96 h of incubation in darkness at 25 °C. Three replicates were used for each concentration. Each measure was compared with the control cultures under the same conditions. The percent inhibition of growth diameter (IP) was calculated accordingly to the following formula:
 <disp-formula>IP = (C − T)/C × 100</disp-formula> where C and T represent the mean diameter of three replicates of mycelia growth in control and treated slides, respectively.
