<p>Tocols of the six 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> oils were presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04569-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-04569">supplementary materials</xref>. The HPLC analyses showed that 
 <italic>Peganum</italic> oils were rich on tocols. They contained four tocopherol isomers—α-, β-, γ- and δ-tocopherol (abbreviated α-T, β-T, γ-T, and δ-T, respectively)—as well as three tocotrienol isomers: α-, γ- and δ-tocotrienol (α-T3, γ-T3 and δ-T3, respectively).
