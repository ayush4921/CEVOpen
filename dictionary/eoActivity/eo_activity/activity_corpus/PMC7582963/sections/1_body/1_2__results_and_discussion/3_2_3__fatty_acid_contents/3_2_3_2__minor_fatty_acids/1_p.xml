<p>Linolenic acid (C18:3) was the most abundant minor fatty acid component detected in 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> seed oils. The minimum and maximum values were 0.21% and 0.84%, respectively, with a mean of 0.65% (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04569-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). These values differed from previous reports of 3.6% [

 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-04569" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Behenic acid (C22:0) was detected in all samples, with a mean content of 0.37%. However, lignoceric acid (C24:0) was detected only in samples from the southern regions, with values of 0.09% (GB), 0.23% (KO) and 0.12% (MD). The remaining minor fatty acids were C18:1 Ï‰11 (0.43%) and C20:0 (0.62%).
