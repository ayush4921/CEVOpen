The γ-T was also detected in considerable levels, with contents ranging from 143.18 (SE) to 277.61 mg/100 g (MD), with an average of 205.46 mg/100 g (7.6%), whereas the α-T content varied from 19.27 (KO) to 51.05 mg/100 g (GF). The β-T was detected at lower quantities (values ranged 6.17–10.8 mg/100 g). The γ-T3 was detected at lower amount, with an average content of 17.3 mg/100 g. Previous studies [

In our work, δ-T was the most abundant isomer, but in a previous study only low contents of this component were found in most tested vegetable oils (0–6% of total tocols) [
