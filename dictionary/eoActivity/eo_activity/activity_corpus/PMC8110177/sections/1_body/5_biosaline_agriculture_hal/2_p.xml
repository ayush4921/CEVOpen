<p id="p0180">Although there are several definitions for biosaline agriculture (
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Abdelly et al., 2008</xref>), recently (
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Ayyam et al., 2019</xref>), have defined biosaline agriculture as “the plant-based approaches of using salt-affected land and water based on the salinity ranges of soil, water, and other associated factors”. A little earlier (
 <xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr">Nikalje et al., 2018</xref>), indicated that biosaline agriculture is “profitable and improved agricultural practices using saline land and saline irrigation water with the purpose of achieving better production through a sustainable and integrated use of genetic resources (plants, animals, fish, insects, and microorganisms) avoiding expensive soil recovery measures”. Before these two definitions (
 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Ladeiro, 2012</xref>), had said “an innovative strategy for enhancing land and water availability is the use of salted soils and salted water, in a strategy designated as saline agriculture.” In general, we can summarize haloculture as “sustainable and economic utilization of saline water and soil resources”.
