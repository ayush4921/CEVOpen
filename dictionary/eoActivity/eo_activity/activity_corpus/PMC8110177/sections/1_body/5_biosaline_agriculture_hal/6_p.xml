<p id="p0210">The policies of different countries of the world towards reclaiming the land for the exploitation of very salty resources, although differing in detail, follow the same approach in general (
 <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Khorsandi, 2017</xref>). Of course, most policies are in the form of research, extension and development pilot programs, and there is no real implementation plan. As an example, we can mention various research-extension institutes that are active in the field of haloculture. These include the Halophyte Biotechnology Center at the University of Delaware, the International Center for Biosaline Agriculture in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, the Institute of Sustainable Halophyte Utilization at the University of Karachi, Pakistan, the National Salinity Research Center in Yazd, Iran, the Organization for Agriculture in Saline Environments in the Netherlands, and The Seawater Foundation in various countries around the world. Indeed, rereading territorial capabilities for major economic products have only been carried out in the last two cases. The Seawater Foundation had two major projects: the production of shrimp, salicornia, and mangrove in Eritrea in 1998, and the production of salicornia, shrimp, and mangrove in Mexico in 2010. Also in Mexico, the Organization for Agriculture in Saline Environments is engaged in agro-forestry for wood production, salicornia cultivation and seaweed harvesting (
