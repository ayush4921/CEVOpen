<p id="p0270">Due to the increasing trend of saline soils and declining water quality along with a quantitative decrease in freshwater resources, more attention will be paid to haloculture. Covid-19 has not created the haloculture system, however, it has accelerated the move towards it. Therefore, it seems that in the future haloculture will be of more interest to plant scientists (due to plant diversification), investors (due to high economic productivity) and environmentalists (due to sustainability). In this regard, the role of haloculture in reducing the negative effects of climate change and heat islands should be given more attention. The physiological and molecular aspects of the tolerance and survival mechanisms of halophytes under hyper-saline conditions should be studied. Also, the economic, social, political and environmental factors of haloculture systems have not yet received the necessary attention. In general, haloculture is expected to play a greater role in the future of the world.</p>
