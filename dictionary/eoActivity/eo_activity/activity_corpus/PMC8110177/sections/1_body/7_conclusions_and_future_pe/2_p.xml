<p id="p0265">The service and trade sectors have suffered the most from COVID-19, while agriculture and natural resources have experienced the least impact, and this could be viewed as an opportunity. With the expansion of large online companies and chain stores, the role of technology is increasing and services are declining. As the coronavirus accelerates the shrinkage in the trade and services sector, the need for energy has decreased and economies are moving towards independence to increase capital security. The global economy is changing as a result of this behavior, from business-oil to agriculture-gas. Limited freshwater has increased the need to use unconventional resources such as saline water and soil in order to ensure food security for the rising world population. Therefore, adopting haloculture is desirable, since it is doubly important in the current situation. Indeed, as well as having a lower impact on the environment and making little-used resources available to agriculture, haloculture can benefit the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and counteract its induced negative effects.</p>
