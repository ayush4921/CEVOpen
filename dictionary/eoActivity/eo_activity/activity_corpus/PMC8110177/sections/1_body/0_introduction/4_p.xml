<p id="p0045">As a result, the World Bank reported that exports of agricultural commodities have fallen by a considerable amount, with effects on the livelihoods of farmers and hence overall agribusinesses (

This information shows how the COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the current vulnerability of agriculture, already challenged by climate change and scarcity of resources, such as quantitative and qualitative reduction of water resources, salinization and infertility of soils, and global pollinator decline. It is believed that the temporal and spatial distribution and amount of precipitation as well as temperature patterns in different parts of the world have different effects, which cause the spatial and temporal distribution of water and soil resources to undergo different changes (
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2017</xref>). It is estimated that doubling CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentrations by 2100 will lead to a 1–5 °C increase in temperature, which will result in significant changes in soil and water resources, energy, agribusiness, food production and forestry, and will intensify current environmental crises (

Globally, the effect of climate change on agricultural production has been negative but under-estimated until the middle of the century. The higher costs of practical actions to reduce the negative effects of climate change were associated with reduced production, especially for meat production and rice cultivation, which could be related to the intensity of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the production process of these two products (

 <xref rid="bib124" ref-type="bibr">Van Meijl et al., 2018</xref>), the intensity of GHG emission was estimated by five global climate and agro-economic models, consisted of integrated assessment (IMAGE), partial equilibrium (CAPRI, GLOBIOM, MAgPIE) and computable general equilibrium (MAGNET).
