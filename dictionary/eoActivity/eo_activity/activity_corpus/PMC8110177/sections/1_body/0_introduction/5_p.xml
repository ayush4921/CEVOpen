In general, to reduce the negative impact of climate change, developed countries can help themselves and developing countries from two perspectives: mitigation and adaptation. In the case of mitigation, developed countries fight climate change by reducing their own industrial activity and help to upgrade equipment in developing countries to reduce GHG. In the case of adaptation, some action should be taken to reduce the adverse consequences of climate change and to take advantage of positive opportunities (
