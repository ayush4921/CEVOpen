<p id="p0240">Most halophytes mentioned for haloculture systems are of a medicinal nature, and many others, although not known as medicinal plants, have considerable medicinal effects. For example, 
 <italic>Myracrodruon urundeuva</italic>, 
 <italic>Aspidosperma pyrifolium</italic>, 
 <italic>Erythrina velutina</italic> and other halophytes of Caatinga bioma are used by the population of Sert√£o region (Brazil) to cure some ailments (

These varieties of molecules and biochemical compounds include steroids, flavonoids, alkaloids, phenolics, tannins, glucosides, terpenoids, coumarin, nitrate, oxalate, amino acids, carotenoids, and some other organic acids, etc. (
