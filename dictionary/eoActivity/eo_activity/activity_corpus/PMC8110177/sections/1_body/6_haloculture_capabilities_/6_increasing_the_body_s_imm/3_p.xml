<p id="p0245">Above all, cultivation of medicinal halophytes that strengthen the immune system in haloculture systems and its consumption with medical considerations, can reduce some of the negative effects of COVID-19. For example, 
 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Khaerunnisa et al. (2020)</xref> surveyed some compounds in medicinal plants and recommended kaempferol, quercetin, luteolin-7-glucoside, apigenin-7-glucoside, naringenin, oleuropein, demethoxycurcumin, curcumin, catechin, and epigallocatechin as potential inhibitors of COVID-19. These compounds are found in various plant species including spinach (

 <italic>Pistacia vera</italic>) and ginger (
 <italic>Zingiber officinale</italic>), have varied levels of salinity tolerance. Most of these plants, with high salinity tolerance can grow in saline agrecosystems. Licorice is a plant that easily grows and reproduces as a native species in saline environments. Pomegranates and especially pistachios, are trees that are cultivated in saline soils using saline water in many areas, and mangrove is a tree that grows naturally in very salty water (more than 40 dS m
