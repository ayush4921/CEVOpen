<p id="p0225">To compensate for the decline in production due to the prevalence of COVID-19, unconventional water sources such as saline surface water and groundwater, saline well water, sewage water, farm drainage, seawater, and saline lakes can enter the production cycle. Good research has been done in this regard and the technical knowledge of many products has been prepared (

In a haloculture system, halophytes are the most important component, which we defined as “plants with the ability to adapt in saline conditions through preventing salt from entering the plant or reducing the salt concentration in the cytoplasm”. Halophytes can grow with unconventional water sources that are not appropriate for conventional crops and are particularly meant for producing fuel, food, fodder, oils, fiber, plant resins, essential oils, and medicinal plants (
