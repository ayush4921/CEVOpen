<p id="p0260">Both haloculture and conventional agriculture entail costs related to manpower and chemical and non-chemical inputs. However, haloculture can be performed with cheaper land and water sources (
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Abdelly et al., 2008</xref>). Haloculture can boost agricultural production with the underused resources of saline soil and saline water in seemingly barren lands, which can be set up with resources of about 10% of the cost in normal agricultural conditions (
 <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Khorsandi, 2016</xref>). This means the production of, for example, livestock fodder in a haloculture system is more economical than its production through conventional agriculture (
 <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Khorsandi et al., 2020</xref>). This already favors haloculture in normal conditions, but in conjunction with catastrophic events destroying farming or causing damage to agricultural trade, haloculture has a very important advantage: it reduces losses. It can therefore be argued that haloculture is more ecofriendly and cheaper than conventional agriculture. Consequently, when a crop is damaged due to a pandemic, such as COVID-19 or something similar that may happen in the future, the losses are fewer in agriculture, in both economic and environmental aspects.
