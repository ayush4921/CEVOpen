<p id="p0220">Twelve percent (about 1.6 billion ha of world land) of the total global land area is cultivated for producing agricultural crops, rising to 20% of available lands in low-income countries (
 <xref rid="bib133" ref-type="bibr">FAO, 2011</xref>). As mentioned above, COVID-19 has a significant negative impact on the production and transfer of commodities. To increase production in this situation, haloculture systems can be introduced in saline lands, which are almost unusable in conventional agriculture (

 <xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr">Nikalje et al., 2018</xref>). Good quality soils already have agricultural uses and there is rising competition between agriculture and other economic sectors, which has left few spaces of high quality land for agricultural extension (
 <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Khorsandi, 2016</xref>). The world's salt-affected lands are about 50% of irrigated areas. Furthermore, as a consequence of salinization in these lands, more than $12 billion economic losses have been estimated in the agricultural sector (
 <xref rid="bib109" ref-type="bibr">Shabala, 2013</xref>). There is very little arable land left, and even if any remains, the critical limited freshwater resources do not allow for the development of conventional agriculture. Therefore, there is no choice but to use saline and hyper-saline land to develop agriculture and increase production, so as to reduce some of the COVID-19-induced production declines.
