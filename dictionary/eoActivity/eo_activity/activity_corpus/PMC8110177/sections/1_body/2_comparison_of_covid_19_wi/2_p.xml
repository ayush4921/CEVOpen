<p id="p0075">Comparing COVID-19 with previous crises can be useful in learning lessons for better management of the current crisis and preparation for future crises. When comparing the GFC in 2006–2008 with the COVID-19 outbreak, three major economic similarities are found: uncertainty, economic collapse and financial reactions (

The GEPU and WPU stand at 348 and nearly 150 in the COVID-19 crisis, respectively, and are higher than those during the GFC (GEPU = 202, WPU = 10), as shown in

The initial decline in the stock markets of major countries was similar in the two crises, and interestingly, both global recessions have been recognized as the largest since the Great Recession between 2007 and 2009. To limit the negative impact of both crises, governments and organizations have provided broad support for monetary and fiscal policies.
