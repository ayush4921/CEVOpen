<p id="p0155">The impact of climate change on agribusiness is more severe in subsistence farming, small-scale production units and poor families in underdeveloped local communities. Although financial incentive approaches can lead to short-term gains, they increase the vulnerability of these communities in the long run (

In Nepal, for example, COVID-19 has severely pressured subsistence agriculture and small-scale farmers in underdeveloped societies that depend on agriculture and also ensure Nepal's food security. Even after overcoming coronavirus, if agricultural patterns in such communities are not improved and continue to be disrupted, millions of people will lose their livelihoods and the country's food security could be threatened. Therefore, extensive measures should be considered to minimize the damage to subsistence agriculture in the short-term and to plan for the creation of more resilient communities in the long-term. Possible practical solutions include “global supply of agricultural products through central sales units to the market”, “returning the staple crops to the track” and “reducing the pressures on the land to increase production” (
