<p>As recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS manual), the antimicrobial activity of EOs of the investigated plants was assayed by the diffusion method. The tested bacterial strains were: 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic>—ATCC 51299, 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic> (Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci, VRE), 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>—ATCC 12228, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>—ATCC 43300, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA) 43300, 
 <italic>S. typhimurium</italic>—ATCC 14028, 
 <italic>A. baumannii</italic>, (Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, CRE)—ATCC 19605, 
 <italic>S. sonnei</italic>–25931, 
 <italic>K. pneumonia</italic> (Extended spectrum beta-lactamases, ESBL)—ATCC 700603, 
 <italic>K. pneumonia</italic> (CRE)—ATCC 1705, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Proteus mirabilis</italic>—ATCC 43071, and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>—ATCC 35218. Above acronyms are as follows: ATTC: American Type Culture Collection; 
 <italic>VRE</italic>: Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci; MRSA: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; ESBL: Extended spectrum beta-lactamases; CRE: Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. Each bacterial strain was suspended in Mueller–Hinton Broth and adjusted to 0.5 McFarland scale turbidity. The surface of Muller–Hinton agar plates was swabbed in three directions with standard inoculum, using sterile cotton swabs. The plates were allowed to dry for 10 min before 3-mm wells were cut into the Muller–Hinton agar using sterile plastic pipettes. Then, the wells were filled with 20 µL and 30 µL of EO dissolved in DMSO at the rate of 1/10 
 <italic>v/v</italic>, since the EO of 
 <italic>Lavandula pubescens</italic> was the only active one, the test was repeated by using the pure major constituent carvacrol at the concentration of 10 mg/mL in dimethyl sulfoxide (20 mg of carvacrol was dissolved in 2 mL of DMSO), 30 µL per well (corresponding to 300 µg per well), with vancomycin (30 µg disc) as a positive control for Gram-positive bacterial strains while amikacin (30 µg disc) and ciprofloxacin dissolved in DMSO with the rate 1000 µg/1000 µL (30 µg per well) were used as a positive control for Gram-negative bacterial strains; furthermore, dimethyl sulfoxide was used as a negative control. All plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h under aerobic conditions. After the incubation period, the plates were examined, and the diameter of each inhibition zone was measured.
