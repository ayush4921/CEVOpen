<p>Recently, in Saudi Arabia, new outbreaks of multidrug-resistant pathogenic microorganisms have been recorded in intensive care units, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, out of which 
 <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli,</italic> and 
 <italic>Klebsiella pnemoniae</italic> can cause fatal respiratory tract infections and pneumonia, blood stream infections and urinary tract infections. Not only this, but also the transmission and spread of infectious diseases during mass public gatherings such as Hajj (an annual pilgrimage to the Holy Mecca, Saudi Arabia) poses an enormous challenge. The global spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria by international travelers may occur during pilgrimages or when visitors return to their home countries [

Due to the increasing presence of multidrug-resistant pathogenic microorganisms, the present study also aims to test these three EOs against three Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria to assess their potential use as alternative antimicrobial agents.
