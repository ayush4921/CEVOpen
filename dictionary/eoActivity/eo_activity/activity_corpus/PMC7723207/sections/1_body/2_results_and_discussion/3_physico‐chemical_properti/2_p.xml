<p>Gelatin‐pectin solutions displayed a Newtonian fluid nature with low conductivity, acidic pH, low surface tension, low zeta‐potential, and nanoscale particle sizes (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31935-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The addition of essential oils had no significant effects on conductivity, viscosity, surface tension, size and zeta‐potential, electrical net surface charge of the gelatin‐pectin particles in the solution. The rheological properties are key parameters for particle stability; hence, they were measured to determine the tendency of particles for aggregation or dispersion in biological fluids as well as their ability to deliver payloads. The bioactivity of essential oils may change with their physical properties. Different studies have reported higher bioactivity for essential oils at acidic pH. Because, at low pH, essential oils are more hydrophobic and will be passed through the cell membranes easily (Liu et al.,

In the Newtonian fluid, the viscosity of the solution is independent of the shear rate. The shear stress was increased by an increase in the shear rate in a linear manner. Thus, viscosity remained constant (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31935-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The increase in the shear stress may be related to a negative charge and the small sizes of the particles and to the increased interfacial surface and finally causing a rise in the friction force between particles. By the increase in the shear rate, the contact between particles will be increased and the result is the increase in shear stress (Pitois &amp; Rouyer,
