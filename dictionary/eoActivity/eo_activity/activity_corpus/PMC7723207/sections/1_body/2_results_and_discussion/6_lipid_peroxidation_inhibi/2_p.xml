<p>ODEO, TAEO, TKEO, and ZMEO inhibited lipid peroxidation stimulated by copper ion at 120 to 130 µg/ml but at a lower level than positive control, BHT (Table

The accumulation of superoxide and hydroperoxide radicals under hyperglycemia leads to lipid peroxidation initiation and propagation, especially in conjugated polyunsaturated fatty acids. This process causes the production of reactive aldehydes such as glyoxal, methylglyoxal, and malondialdehyde that create lipoxidation products (Moldogazieva et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31935-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Lipoxidation leads to an increase in protein aggregation that results in a dramatic change in cell signaling which causes cell damages and cell death. This process is associated with numerous pathological disorders like neurodegenerative diseases, atherosclerosis, inflammation, and vascular complications of diabetes (Tangvarasittichai,

 <xref rid="fsn31935-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>). The antioxidant ability of phytochemicals as polyphenols, flavonoids, and terpenoids is because of the redox potentials that make them act as electron donors, reducing power, proton donors, and singlet oxygen quenchers (Salehi et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31935-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). The strong antioxidant capacity of studied essential oils against lipid peroxidation has been related to phytochemical compounds like thymol and carvacrol or the synergism between para‐cymene and gamma‐terpinene.
