<p>ODEO, TAEO, TKEO, and ZMEO at 110 to 130 µg/ml, inhibited glucose oxidation in the presence of copper ion in a similar manner, but at a lower level than EDTA (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31935-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Hydroxyl radicals can be generated from glucose autoxidation under the influence of transition metal ions like copper. The degree of benzoate hydroxylation reveals the extent of glucose oxidation. The decrease in benzoate hydroxylation in the presence of essential oils was mainly due to the scavenging of transition metals or hydroxyl radicals. Glucose autoxidation catalyzed by transition metals generates hydroxyl radicals and ketoaldehydes. Ketoaldehydes attach to proteins and lipids and produce an advanced glycation end product of proteins and lipids (Chetyrkin et al.,

Metal‐chelating agents inhibit glucose autoxidation and also reduce the covalent attachment of glucose (ketoaldehydes) to protein and lipids. As a result, the antioxidant essential oils by scavenging metal ions or hydroxyl radicals reduce glucose oxidation and protein glycation (Wu et al.,
