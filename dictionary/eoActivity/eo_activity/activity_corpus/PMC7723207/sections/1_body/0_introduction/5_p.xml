<p>Present study is focused on the chemical characterization of the volatile oils extracted from 
 <italic>O. decumbens</italic> (ODEO), 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> (TAEO), 
 <italic>Z. multiflora</italic> (ZMEO), and 
 <italic>T. kotschyanus</italic> (TKEO). The essential oils were encapsulated in the gelation‐composite solution. The rheological properties of the gelatin‐pectin‐essential oils composite solutions were then studied. The gelatin‐pectin‐essential oil particles were prepared by electrospray and the morphology of the particles analyzed by scanning electron microscope. The in vitro antioxidant and anti‐diabetic capacities of the gelation‐pectin composite particles against glucose oxidation, lipid peroxidation, protein peroxidation, protein glycation, α‐amylase, and α‐glucosidase were analyzed.
