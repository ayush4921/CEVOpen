<p>This study shows that a natural preservative (nutmeg seed products) can substitute chemical preservatives and protect gelatin-based tablets from mold and prolong the shelf-life of tablets. These data are the basis for further research into the use of natural substances (extracts, essential oil) in the protection of medicines or other forms (food supplements) against mold and the additional exploitation of the pharmacological effects of plants.</p>
