<p>To compare storage conditions and containers, the opened plastic bag (OR) had the highest influence on the weight loss of gel tablets, all samples lost over 40% of mass and it was determined that glycerol significantly protects chewable gel tablets from weight loss when the tablets are in an open-air container. Temperature below zero (PBF) has an influence on water separation from gel tablets base—as was determined when they were left in a room temperature for 30 min (
