<p>A pilot-study was performed and the tablet base was selected before starting the study on the influence of nutmeg as a preservative on the quality of chewable tablets. The primary mass of chewable tablets with different gelatin concentrations (five compositions) was prepared and the G0 composition (
 <xref rid="pharmaceutics-13-00238-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) was selected according to the best physical parameters, taste and sensation, and a study was initiated with different preservatives. Gelatin concentration in five bases was from 7.69% to 15.38% and the best chewable gel tablets’ base was determined with 13.46% of gelatin. In the Morten et al. (2018) study on gelatin-based pharmaceutical oral formulation, 8.8–10% concentration of gelatin was used [

To prepare gummy candies, the Pizzoni et al. (2015) study of gummy candies with strawberry flavors used 6.5% of gelatin, and the Deleris et al. (2011) study about candies and aroma release dynamic used 0–15% of gelatin [

Chewable gel tablets are similar to gummies or candies, but they differ from them—they are eaten not as a desert but as a food supplement or a medical substance, and they have a medical and nutrition purpose because they are equivalent to chewable tablets which have a recognition in the European Pharmacopoeia [
