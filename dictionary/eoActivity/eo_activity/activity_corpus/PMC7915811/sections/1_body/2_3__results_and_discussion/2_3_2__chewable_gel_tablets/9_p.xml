<p>In a squeezable plastic bag as a storage location, it was determined that the gel tablets in there had the most variable shelf-life. In SR conditions, 70% of the samples developed a mold after 14 days (sample G0 earlier). Only three samples (E, Ee, and Eos, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-13-00238-f002">Figure 2</xref>D) did not have a mold after 28 days. The Ee and Eos samples were stable for 75 days and the E for 52 days. These results show that ethanol and nutmeg ethanolic extract or nutmeg essential oil ethanolic solution have a higher influence on chewable gel tabletsâ€™ shelf-life than sodium benzoate, citric acid or other solutions. These results (SR) were influenced by the chosen packaging (squeezable bag, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-13-00238-f003">Figure 3</xref>) because results in a plastic box at room temperature (CR) were different. The mass variation (
