<p>Chewable gel tablets with nutmeg essential oil or extract had a longer shelf-life than other tablets. Ee, Eo, and Eos samples’ shelf-life was over 180 days. They all had nutmeg as a preservative. Nutmeg essential oil has influence on microorganism growth suppression, 0.2% of essential oil suppressed the growth of

The chewable gel tablets with citric acid had a higher influence on protection from mold growth than sodium benzoate, which is usually used as a preservative in food or pharmacy industries. Sodium benzoate is an artificial preservative which has negative effects on health, it can be dangerous and can cause asthma, cancer, and hypersensivity [
