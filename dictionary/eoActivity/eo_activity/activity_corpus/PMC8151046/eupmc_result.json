    "Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) cannabinoids and terpenoids have therapeutic effects on human and animal health. Cannabis plants can often have a relatively high heterogeneity, which leads to different phenotypes that have different chemical profiles despite being from the same variety. Little information exists about cannabinoid and terpenoid profiles in different hemp phenotypes within the same variety. For this study, 11 phenotypes from three different varieties (“Carmagnola” selected (CS), “Tiborszallasi” (TS), and “Finola” selection (FS)) were analyzed. The components of essential oil (29) were analyzed using gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC/FID), and 10 different cannabinoids of each phenotype were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Principal component analysis (PCA) and analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that according to the components of essential oil, FS and TS plants were more uniform than CS plants, where there were great differences between CI and CII phenotypes. The content of cannabinoid CBD-A was the highest in all four FS phenotypes. By comparing cannabinoid profiles, FS was clearly separated from TS and CS, while these two varieties were not clearly distinguishable. Phenotypes TV and CI had the highest total content of Δ-9-THC, while all phenotypes of FS had the highest total content of CBD. The highest total content of CBG was determined in phenotype CI. Obtained results are useful for the development of new supplementary ingredients, for different pharmacy treatments, and for further breeding purposes."
