  <italic>Cyperus articulatus</italic> L. is popularly known as priprioca. Its rhizomes are used as a medicine in the treatment of malaria in traditional medicine. Since priprioca oil is extracted for commercial purpose, we evaluated if the components from the priprioca residue can be a source of antiplasmodial active molecules. This study aimed to determine the in vitro antiplasmodial and cytotoxicity activities of the ethanolic extract of 
  <italic>C. articulatus</italic> as an in vitro antiplasmodial agent. From the solid residue of the plant rhizomes, 40 g samples were removed and subjected to hot extraction using a Soxhlet extractor. The in vitro antiplasmodial activity was determined using the W2 and 3D7 strains of 
  <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. The phytochemical study identified the following main compounds: corymbolone (14.25%), cyclocolorenone (9.75%), and cadalene (8.36%). The extract exhibited moderate IC
  <sub>50</sub> (inhibitory concentration) against the two strains of 
  <italic>P. falciparum</italic>: 1.21 ± 0.01 against the W2 strain and 1.10 ± 0.06 µg/mL against the 3D7 strain. Our results show the therapeutic potential of priprioca residue as a low-cost antiplasmodial agent.
