<p>The ethanolic extract obtained from the rhizome residue of 
 <italic>Cyperus articulatus</italic> from Santar√©m, Brazil, contained corymbolone as the main compound identified and exhibited a moderate level of activity against two strains of 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (W2 and 3D7). The EECA also showed low cytotoxicity against the human cell line WI-26-VA-4. Our results demonstrate the therapeutic potential of 
 <italic>C. articulatus</italic> as an antiplasmodial agent.
