<p>In addition, an in silico study of the activities of triterpenes and iridoids isolated from 
 <italic>Himatanthus articulatus</italic> (Vahl) Woodson did not identify any molecules with antiplasmodial activity [
 <xref rid="B34-pathogens-09-00889" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. One limitation of the present study is related to the source of antiplasmodial activity. We found three major components in the residue extract, corymbolone (14.25%), cyclocolorenone (9.75%), and cadalene (8.36%). The antimalarial activity is most likely from one of those or from a combined effect between two or more compounds present in the tested extract. Further studies are required to verify the antiplasmodial activity using purified chemical components found in the ethanolic extract of priprioca residue, which could be used as a new drug for malaria treatment.
