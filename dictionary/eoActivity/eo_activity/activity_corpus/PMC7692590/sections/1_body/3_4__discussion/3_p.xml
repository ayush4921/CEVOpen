<p>As for cytotoxic activity, one study found that 
 <italic>C. articulatus</italic> essential oil was moderately cytotoxic to monkey kidney cells [
 <xref rid="B32-pathogens-09-00889" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, with 
 <italic>C. articulatus</italic> essential oil, a noncytotoxic result was obtained for human pulmonary fibroblasts by cell viability assay with MTT (LC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 100 μg/mL) [
 <xref rid="B32-pathogens-09-00889" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. It was also observed that the IC
 <sub>50</sub> of W2 and 3D7 strains of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> treated with essential oil were 1.21 μg/mL and 2.30 μg/mL, respectively [
 <xref rid="B33-pathogens-09-00889" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], consistent with the findings in this study.
