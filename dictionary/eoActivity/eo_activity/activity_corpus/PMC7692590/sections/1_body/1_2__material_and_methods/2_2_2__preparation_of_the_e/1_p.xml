<p>Five kilograms of the rhizomes of 
 <italic>C. articulatus</italic> were collected. After collection, the rhizomes were cleaned, dried for three consecutive days, and ground in a knife mill in an open environment. After drying, the crushed material was subjected to hydrodistillation by a 150 L steam distillation system for 1.5 to 4 h, to obtain the essential oil. From the solid vegetable residue waste originating from the extraction by steam system, 40 g samples were removed and subjected to hot extraction in a Soxhlet extractor using ethanol 96%. The solvent of the solution resulting from the hot extraction was evaporated in a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure to obtain a concentrate of the ethanolic extract of the residue of
