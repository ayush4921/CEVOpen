<p>The selectivity index (SI) is the relationship between the cytotoxic and antiparasitic activities of each compound. The SI was obtained from the ratio between the LC
 <sub>50</sub> value for WI cell line and the IC
 <sub>50</sub> for 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (strain W2) according to the formula: SI = LC
 <sub>50</sub> cell line WI/IC
 <sub>50</sub>
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (strain W2). Values greater than 10 were considered indicative of high selectivity, whereas substances with values below 10 were considered to have low selectivity [
