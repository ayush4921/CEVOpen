<p>For the analysis of cell viability, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, Sigma-Aldrich, Inc. St. Louis, MO, USA) was used with the cell line WI-26VA-4 (lung fibroblast ATCC CCL-95.1); this strain is part of the animal cell bank of the Cell Biology Service (SBC) of the Ezequiel Dias Foundation (FUNED). The cells were maintained in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 21 mM bicarbonate, 40 mg/mL gentamicin, and 10% (

 <sup>5</sup> cells/well, and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in a humid atmosphere containing 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. After that, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Subsequently, the EECA was added at different concentrations, ranging from 1000 to 0.1 μg/mL. After 48 h of incubation, the plate was washed again with phosphate-buffered saline with 100 μL of MTT tetrazolium salt added at a concentration of 5 mg/mL. The plate was incubated again for another 3 h. After discarding the supernatant, 50 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich, Inc. St. Louis, MO, USA)) was added, and the color obtained was evaluated by reading on a microplate spectrophotometer (model Espectramax M5e, Molecular Devices LLC, San Jose, CA, USA) at a wavelength of 550 nm. The concentration that inhibited cell growth by 50% (LC
 <sub>50</sub>) was determined in comparison to cells cultured without the test compound.
