<p>In vitro antiplasmodial activity was determined using W2 (chloroquine-resistant) and 3D7 (chloroquine-sensitive) strains of 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> grown in human A+ red blood cells in a predominantly ring stage, synchronized using the sorbitol method [
 <xref rid="B23-pathogens-09-00889" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. RPMI 1640 culture medium supplemented with 25 mM HEPES, 21 mM sodium bicarbonate, 300 mM hypoxanthine, 11 mM glucose, 40 mg/mL gentamicin, and 10% (

 <italic>v</italic>) inactivated human plasma was used. The cultures synchronized with 2% parasitemia and 2% hematocrit were distributed in a 96-well microplate. The EECA was added at a starting concentration of 50 μg/mL and twofold serial diluted in incomplete culture medium and 4% DMSO until the final concentration of 0.049 μg/mL. We tested the following concentrations of ECA: 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125, 1.56, 0.78, 0.39, 0.195, 0.098, 0.049 μg/mL. Chloroquine was used as a standard antimalarial. The plate was incubated for 48 h at 37 °C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> and 95% relative humidity. Smears corresponding to each well were made. After being fixed with methanol and stained with Giemsa, the smears were used to count the parasitemia under an optical microscope (1000×). The activity of the compounds was expressed as the percentage of reduction in parasitemia in relation to the negative control (without any antiplasmodial drug), which was considered as 100% of the growth of the parasite. The experiment was performed in triplicate with each concentration of EECA extract, positive and negative controls, tested three times, totaling 39 independent assays per strain (total of 78). The slide reading was blinded (i.e., the slides had codes, and the observer did not know the treatment used in each slide) and performed by the same trained researcher. The concentration of extract that inhibited 50% of the growth of the parasite (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) was determined through dose–response curves, as a function of nonlinear regression.
