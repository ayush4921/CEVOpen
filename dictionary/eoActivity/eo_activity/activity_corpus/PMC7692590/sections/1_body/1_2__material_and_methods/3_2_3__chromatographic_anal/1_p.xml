<p>The analysis of the chemical composition of the EECA was performed in an Agilent gas chromatograph, model HP-6890 equipped with a selective Agilent mass detector, model HP-5975 using an HP-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm) under the following conditions: injector temperature = 250 °C, column = 80 °C, heating rate = 5 °C/min to 280 °C (20 min), and detector = 300 °C. Helium was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL/min and a selective mass detector operating at 70 eV, m/z = 30 to 500 u.m.a. The EECA was solubilized in ethyl acetate at a concentration of 20 mg/mL and the identification of the major compounds in the extract was performed by comparison with the electronic library of the equipment (NIST-11).</p>
