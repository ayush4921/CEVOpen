  <title>Simple Summary</title>
  <p>Due to numerous side effects associated with extensive use of chemical insecticides, there is a need to develop eco-friendly alternative methods for insect pest control. One of these alternatives may be the use of essential oils (EOs). An important aspect of the efficient and safe application of EOs in plant protection is the elucidation of their toxicity mechanisms towards target pests. The present study aimed to determine the effects of 
   <italic>Santolina chamaecyparissus</italic> (L.) and 
   <italic>Tagetes patula</italic> (L.) EOs on development and physiology of two aphid species with different feeding specializations. 
   <italic>Myzus persicae</italic> (Sulzer) is a broad generalist and 
   <italic>Rhopalosiphum padi</italic> (L.) is a grass specialist. Exposure to the tested EOs limited the aphids’ development and led to induction of oxidative stress within their tissues. Analysis of the physiological parameters also showed that the oligophagous 
   <italic>R. padi</italic> was more sensitive to EO treatment than the highly polyphagous 
   <italic>M. persicae</italic>. The results suggest that the tested EOs can affect important biochemical processes within aphid tissues and have potential as eco-friendly aphicides.

  <p>This study investigated the toxicity of essential oils (EOs) from 
   <italic>Santolina chamaecyparissus</italic> (L.) and 
   <italic>Tagetes patula</italic> (L.) towards the green peach aphid 
   <italic>Myzus persicae</italic> (Sulzer) and the bird cherry-oat aphid 
   <italic>Rhopalosiphum padi</italic> (L.). The effects of the EOs on aphid population parameters and levels of biochemical markers of oxidative stress within insect tissues were analyzed. In laboratory bioassays, application of the studied EOs at sublethal concentrations reduced daily fecundity and led to a decrease in the intrinsic rate of natural increase in both aphid species. Treatment with EOs also induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within aphid tissues. The highest levels of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide were noted after 24 and 48 h of exposure. Moreover, a significant increase in lipid peroxidation was shown in treated aphids, especially between 48 and 72 h after exposure. The increase was more pronounced after treatment with the essential oil of 
   <italic>S. chamaecyparissus</italic>, which also exhibited higher aphicidal activity in toxicity tests. The activities of antioxidant enzymes—superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT)—were significantly elevated in both aphid species in response to the tested EOs. The obtained results suggest that oxidative stress evoked by treatment with the studied EOs may be an important factor determining their toxicity towards aphids.
