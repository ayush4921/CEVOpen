<p>Aphids are important insect pests of many agricultural and horticultural crops. During feeding they extract phloem sap, which contains essential nutrients, reducing the vigor and productivity of the plant. In addition, aphids may cause significant damage to the crops by transmission of numerous plant viruses [

 <italic>Myzus persicae</italic> (Sulzer), is a highly polyphagous aphid that feeds on hundreds of host plants from more than 40 plant families, causing huge economic losses in a wide range of crops. In contrast, the bird cherry-oat aphid 
 <italic>Rhopalosiphum padi</italic> (L.) possesses a distinctly narrower range of host plants, mainly from the Poaceae family, and in particular causes serious damage to cereal crops [

It is worth noting that aphids infesting a wider range of host plants possess more efficient mechanisms of biochemical adaptations to allelochemicals, and therefore oxidative stress can be generated to a lesser extent than in more specialized species [
