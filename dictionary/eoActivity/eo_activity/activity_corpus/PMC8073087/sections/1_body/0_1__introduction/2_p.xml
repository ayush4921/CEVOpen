<p>The most common approach for controlling aphid populations is the application of synthetic insecticides. However, long-term and repeated use of these chemicals has led to the development of insecticide resistance in aphids, especially in

 <xref rid="B7-insects-12-00360" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Consequently, it creates a cycle of increasing insecticide doses and growing insect resistance. Additionally, the residues associated with the use of pesticides are toxic to non-target organisms and hazardous to the environment. These problems have stimulated the research on alternative methods of pest control. Among other alternatives, the use of plant-derived products such as essential oils (EOs) has recently gained considerable attention. These botanicals are good sources of novel insect pest control agents because they contain many substances with active properties against insect pests including insecticides, repellents, antifeedants, ovicides and growth regulators [

 <xref rid="B13-insects-12-00360" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Moreover, EOs are typically complex mixtures that may act on multiple target sites and therefore the probability of developing a resistant population is very low [
