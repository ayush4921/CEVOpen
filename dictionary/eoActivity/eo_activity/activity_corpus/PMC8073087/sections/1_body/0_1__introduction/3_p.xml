<p>An important aspect of efficient and safe use of EOs in plant protection is the elucidation of their mode of action towards the target pests. In general, EOs and their constituents exert their insecticidal activity through neurotoxic effects, such as interference with the neuromodulator octopamine or GABA-gated chloride channels, or by inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity [
