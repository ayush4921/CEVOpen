<p>Previous studies have shown that different classes of allelochemicals can induce the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within insect tissues [

A portion of ROS is scavenged by dietary antioxidants, but most are eliminated by a suite of antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) [
