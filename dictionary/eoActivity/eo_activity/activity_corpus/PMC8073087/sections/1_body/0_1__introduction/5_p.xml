<p>Essential oils from Asteraceae plants possess a wide spectrum of biological activities, including antimicrobial, antifungal and insecticidal properties [

 <xref rid="B25-insects-12-00360" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Our previous studies revealed that several EOs from these plants have potent insecticide activity against the green peach aphid [
 <xref rid="B26-insects-12-00360" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The oils inhibited the activity of acetylcholinesterase and Na
 <sup>+</sup>/K
 <sup>+</sup>-ATPase, important enzymes of the insect nervous system, and upregulated the activity of glutathione S-transferase, a key detoxification enzyme. Based on the above results, we selected two EOs for further testing: the oil of 
 <italic>Santolina chamaecyparissus</italic> L. which had the highest aphicidal activity and oil from 
 <italic>Tagetes patula</italic> L. which had moderate activity. The current study was undertaken in order to deepen the knowledge of the biological and biochemical effects of selected EOs from Asteraceae plants on aphid species with different feeding adaptations, specifically the broad generalist 
 <italic>M. persicae</italic> and the grass specialist 
 <italic>R. padi</italic>. The specific objectives were: (i)Explore the effect of santolina and marigold EOs on population parameters of 
 <italic>M. persicae</italic> and 
 <italic>R. padi</italic>; (ii) Determine the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (superoxide anion radical and hydrogen peroxide) and lipid peroxidation (expressed as concentration of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, TBARS) within aphid tissues after treatment with EOs; and (iii) Analyze the changes in activity of the important antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in both aphid species.
