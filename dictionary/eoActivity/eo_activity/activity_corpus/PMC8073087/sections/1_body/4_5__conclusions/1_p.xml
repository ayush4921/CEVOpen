<p>These results show that EOs from 
 <italic>S. chamaecyparissus</italic> and 
 <italic>T. patula</italic> exhibit considerable toxicity against 
 <italic>M. persicae</italic> and 
 <italic>R. padi</italic>, significantly limiting the aphidsâ€™ biological parameters even at sublethal levels. The mode of action of these oils may be related to the induction of oxidative stress within aphid tissues, since increased levels of ROS and accumulation of lipid peroxidation products was noted after treatment with the tested EOs. In addition, the increased activity of important antioxidant enzymes indicates that an adaptive response to oxidative stress occurred in EO-exposed aphids. The oligophagous 
 <italic>R. padi</italic> was more sensitive to the EO treatment than the highly polyphagous 
 <italic>M. persicae</italic>. The relatively high levels of resistance in the green peach aphid are most likely related to its highly effective mechanisms of xenobiotic detoxification, however further research is needed to explain this phenomenon.
