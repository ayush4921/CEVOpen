<p>The activity of CAT in 
 <italic>M. persicae</italic> significantly increased in comparison with the control only at 24 h after treatment with EO from 
 <italic>S. chamaecyparissus</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00360-f005">Figure 5</xref>). After spraying the aphid with 
 <italic>T. patula</italic> EO, an increase in CAT activity was observed at most of the studied time intervals, however the changes were not statistically significant. In the bird cherry-oat aphid, the activity of CAT was significantly elevated at 24 h and 48 h after application of 
 <italic>S. chamaecyparissus</italic> EO, and at 24 h after treatment with the EO of 
 <italic>T. patula</italic>. It is worth noting that the activity of SOD and especially CAT in treated insects was similar to the control level after 72 h of exposure.
