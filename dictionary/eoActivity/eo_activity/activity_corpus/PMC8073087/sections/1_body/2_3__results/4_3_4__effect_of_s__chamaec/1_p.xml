<p>Treatment with the tested EOs affected the activity of SOD and CAT within tissues of the green peach aphid and the bird cherry-oat aphid. Activities of the studied antioxidant enzymes changed with treatment, time and the treatment Ã— time interaction (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00360-f005">Figure 5</xref>). EO from 
 <italic>S. chamaecyparissus</italic> significantly increased the activity of SOD in both aphid species after 24 and 48 h of exposure (

 <italic>T. patula</italic> EO significantly increased the SOD activity at 24 h in 
 <italic>M. persicae</italic>, and at 12 h and 48 h in
