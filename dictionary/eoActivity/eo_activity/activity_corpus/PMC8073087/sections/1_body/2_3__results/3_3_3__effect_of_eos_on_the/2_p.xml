<p>Levels of hydrogen peroxide in the green peach aphid significantly increased at 24 h and 48 h after application of 
 <italic>S. chamaecyparissus</italic> EO (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00360-f002">Figure 2</xref>). For the bird cherry-oat aphid tissues, a significant increase in hydrogen peroxide generation was observed at 12 h after treatment with EO from 
 <italic>S. chamaecyparissus</italic>, and at 24 h and 48 h for both of the applied EOs. The highest increase for 
 <italic>S. chamaecyparissus</italic> EO was noted after 48 h of exposure (115%) and for 
 <italic>T. patula</italic> EO after 24 h of exposure (80%). It is also worth noting that the observed increase in hydrogen peroxide content was much higher in 
 <italic>R. padi</italic> than in 
 <italic>M. persicae</italic>.
