<p>The tested EOs showed significant toxicity against adult females of 
 <italic>M. persicae</italic> and 
 <italic>R. padi</italic> after 24 h exposure (
 <xref rid="insects-12-00360-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Probit analysis showed that EO from 
 <italic>S. chamaecyparissus</italic> exhibited a higher level of contact toxicity to both aphid species (LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.25% for 
 <italic>R. padi</italic> and LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.34% for 
 <italic>M. persicae</italic>) than EO obtained from 
 <italic>T. patula</italic>, with corresponding LC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.31% and 0.61%. Moreover, the results indicated that the tested EOs were less toxic to the green peach aphid than to the bird cherry-oat aphid females.
