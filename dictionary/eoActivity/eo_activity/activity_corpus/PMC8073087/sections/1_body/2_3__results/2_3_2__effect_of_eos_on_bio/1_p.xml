<p>The results showed that treatment with 
 <italic>S. chamaecyparissus</italic> and 
 <italic>T. patula</italic> EOs affected the development of both aphid species (
 <xref rid="insects-12-00360-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The PRP of 
 <italic>M. persicae</italic> was prolonged by 0.65–0.71 days after treatment with the tested EOs, while in 
 <italic>R. padi</italic> only EO from 
 <italic>T. patula</italic> significantly prolonged the PRP (0.57 days) compared with the control. Moreover, a significant decrease in production of larvae by EO exposed apterous females for both aphid species was observed. Exposure of 
 <italic>M. persicae</italic> to EOs from 
 <italic>S. chamaecyparissus</italic> and 
 <italic>T. patula</italic> limited daily fecundity by 49.9% and 41.3%, respectively. Application of the tested EOs to 
 <italic>R. padi</italic> females reduced daily fecundity by 59.8% for the EO of 
 <italic>S. chamaecyparissus</italic> and 33.1% for the EO of 
 <italic>T. patula</italic>. When comparing the activity of the oils, it was shown that the EO from 
 <italic>S. chamaecyparissus</italic> was more effective in decreasing aphids’ fecundity than the EO from 
 <italic>T. patula</italic>, especially in 
 <italic>R. padi</italic>. Treatment with EOs also led to a significant reduction in the intrinsic rate of natural increase in both aphid species, and similarly the stronger reduction was observed after application of the EO from 
 <italic>S. chamaecyparissus</italic> (25–29%) than 
 <italic>T. patula</italic> (16–22%).
