<p>Results showed that treatment with EOs from 
 <italic>S. chamaecyparissus</italic> and 
 <italic>T. patula</italic> led to significant changes in the level of oxidative stress markers within tissues of 
 <italic>M. persicae</italic> and 
 <italic>R. padi</italic>. The content of superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide and TBARS was modified by treatment, time and the treatment × time interaction (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00360-f002">Figure 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00360-f003">Figure 3</xref>). The concentration of superoxide anion in the green peach aphid significantly increased in comparison to the control at 12 h after application of 
 <italic>S. chamaecyparissus</italic> EO, and only at 24 h after treatment with EO from 
 <italic>T. patula</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00360-f001">Figure 1</xref>). In the bird cherry-oat aphid, the level of this compound was significantly higher at 12 h, 24 h and 48 h for 
 <italic>S. chamaecyparissus</italic> EO, and at 24 h for 
 <italic>T. patula</italic> EO. The observed increase in superoxide anion concentration was more pronounced in 
 <italic>R. padi</italic> (37–46%) than in 
 <italic>M. persicae</italic> (17–35%). Finally, at 48 h and 72 h in 
 <italic>M. persicae</italic> and at 72 h in 
 <italic>R. padi</italic>, the superoxide anion concentration flattened and was similar to untreated insects.
