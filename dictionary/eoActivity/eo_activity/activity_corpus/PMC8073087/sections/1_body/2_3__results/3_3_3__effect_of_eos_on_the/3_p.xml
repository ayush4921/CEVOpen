<p>The content of TBARS showed an upward tendency in both aphid species after exposure to the tested EOs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00360-f003">Figure 3</xref>). The highest level of TBARS was shown at 48 and 72 h after treatment with EO from 
 <italic>S. chamaecyparissus</italic>. Compared to the control, the increase in 
 <italic>R. padi</italic> was more noticeable than in 
 <italic>M. persicae,</italic> i.e., in 
 <italic>R. padi</italic> at 48 h and 72 h it was approximately 100%, and in 
 <italic>M. persicae</italic> by approximately 70%. Treatment with EO from 
 <italic>T. patula</italic> also led to an increase in the content of TBARS; however, this increase was lower in comparison to EO from 
 <italic>S. chamaecyparissus</italic>, and significant changes were only found in 
 <italic>M. persicae</italic> after 24 h exposure and in 
 <italic>R. padi</italic> after 48 h exposure (approximately 60% increase in both cases).
