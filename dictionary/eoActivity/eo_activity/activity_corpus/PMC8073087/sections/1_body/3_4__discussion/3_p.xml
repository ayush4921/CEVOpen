<p>For effective pest management, not only direct mortality of adults, but also limitation of population parameters is important. The results reported here show that application of the EOs from 
 <italic>S. chamaecyparissus</italic> and 
 <italic>T. patula</italic> even at sublethal concentration negatively affects the bionomic parameters of 
 <italic>M. persicae</italic> and 
 <italic>R. padi</italic>. Spraying with the EOs significantly reduced daily fecundity of aphid females and led to a decrease in the intrinsic rate of natural increase. Moreover, the PRP was prolonged by about 10% compared with untreated insects. Previous studies demonstrated that several EOs possess properties similar to juvenile hormones and act as insect growth regulators [

 <xref rid="B46-insects-12-00360" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. They induced disruption in growth and the reproduction of insects. Sammour et al. [
 <xref rid="B45-insects-12-00360" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] showed that treatment with basil oil caused prolongation of the nymphal development of 
 <italic>Aphis craccivora</italic>. Moreover, Chopa and Descamps [
 <xref rid="B47-insects-12-00360" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] reported reduction of the net reproductive rate and the intrinsic rate of population increase in 
 <italic>Metopolophium dirhodum</italic> after treatment with EOs from 
 <italic>Schinus areira</italic> and 
 <italic>Tagetes terniflora</italic>. The results presented here indicate that the bird cherry-oat aphid is more sensitive to the tested EOs than the green peach aphid. This was confirmed in both toxicity bioassays and analysis of biological parameters. Such variation in aphid response may be due to the different biochemical and physiological adaptations to herbivory. Generally, specialists show a greater sensitivity to allelochemicals and react at lower concentrations than generalists [

 <xref rid="B4-insects-12-00360" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] showed that the monophagous grain aphid 
 <italic>Sitobion avenae</italic> F. after exposure to phenolic compounds had significantly higher level of oxidative stress markers than the oligophagous 
 <italic>R. padi</italic>. On the other hand, Bruce et al. [
 <xref rid="B49-insects-12-00360" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] showed that 
 <italic>M. persicae</italic> was less sensitive to the 
 <italic>Hemizygia petiolata</italic> essential oil treatment than 
 <italic>S. avenae</italic> and 
 <italic>A. pisum</italic>. Moreover, our earlier studies indicated a relatively low level of 
 <italic>M. persicae</italic> sensitivity towards plant secondary metabolites during research on aphicidal activity of phenolic-rich extracts obtained from several medicinal plants [
