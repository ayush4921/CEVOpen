<p>EOs are complex mixtures of secondary plant metabolites. They generally consist of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and biogenetically related phenols, all of which are characterized by low molecular weight [

 <xref rid="B34-insects-12-00360" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. These mixtures of metabolites interfere with insect physiology through different mechanisms and at various target sites. In our previous research [
 <xref rid="B26-insects-12-00360" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], the composition of the studied EOs was chemically characterized by GC-MS analysis. It was shown that the EO extracted from 
 <italic>S. chamaecyparissus</italic> mainly consisted of artemisia ketone (25.9%), 
 <italic>β</italic>-phellandrene (18.7%), vulgarone B (11.6%) and 
 <italic>β</italic>-myrcene (9.2%), while the main components of 
 <italic>T. patula</italic> EO were terpinolene (15.8%), limonene (12.5%) and piperitone (9.8%).
