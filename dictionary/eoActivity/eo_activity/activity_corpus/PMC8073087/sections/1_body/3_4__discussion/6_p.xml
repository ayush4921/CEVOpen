<p>Comparing the biochemical response of the studied aphid species under treatment with EOs, it was shown that the level of oxidative stress markers was distinctly higher in 
 <italic>R. padi</italic> than in 
 <italic>M. persicae</italic>. The relatively low level of oxidative stress in the green peach aphid may result from the very efficient mechanisms of xenobiotic detoxification in this species. Castells and Berenbaum [
 <xref rid="B58-insects-12-00360" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] and Wen et al. [
 <xref rid="B59-insects-12-00360" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] suggest that polyphagous insects possess an expanded enzymatic system able to remove a wide range of plant allelochemicals. Moreover, our previous studies [
 <xref rid="B26-insects-12-00360" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], have shown upregulation of detoxification mechanisms based on glutathione S-transferase within the green peach aphid under Asteraceae EOs treatment. This enzyme belongs to the phase II detoxification system and catalyzes the reduced glutathione conjugation with activated (in phase I) toxic metabolites. Among phase I detoxification enzymes, the cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) have been assumed as crucial proteins that oxidize botanical pesticides [
