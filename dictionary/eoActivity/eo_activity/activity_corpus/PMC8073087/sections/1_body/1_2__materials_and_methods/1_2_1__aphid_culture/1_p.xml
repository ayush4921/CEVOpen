<p>The aphids used in this study were obtained from a stock culture kept at the Siedlce University of Natural Sciences and Humanities, Poland. A parthenogenetic clone of 
 <italic>M. persicae</italic> was reared on pea seedlings (
 <italic>Pisum sativum</italic> L.) whereas 
 <italic>R. padi</italic> was reared on winter wheat (
 <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.). Insect cultures were maintained in controlled environmental chambers at 23 ± 1 °C with 65% relative humidity (RH) and 16:8 h (L:D) photoperiod. Wingless adult parthenogenetic females in the first day of reproduction were selected for all subsequent experiments.
