<p>The bioassays were performed following the methodology previously described by Czerniewicz et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-insects-12-00360" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The tested EOs were dissolved in ethanol to give stock solutions of 40% (
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>). The EOs solutions for bioassays were prepared by appropriate dilution of the stock solution in water with the addition of Tween 80 (0.075% 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) as an emulsifier and ethanol (2% 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>). A mixture of Tween 80 and ethanol in water at the same concentration as above, but without the tested EOs, was used as a control solution. All bioassays were performed in controlled conditions at 23 ± 1 °C, 65% r.h. and L16:D8 photoperiod.
