<p>The concentration of TBARS was evaluated using the procedure described by Halliwell and Gutteridge [
 <xref rid="B30-insects-12-00360" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] with some modification. The reaction mixture consisted of 1 mL of supernatant, 1 mL of 0.6% thiobarbituric acid (TBA) in 0.25 M HCl and 1 mL of 15% trichloroacetic acid (TCA). Simultaneously, two controls were prepared. The first one contained water instead of aphid homogenate, and in the second one TBA solution was replaced with water. The obtained mixtures were heated at 95 °C for 60 min, cooled in ice, and then centrifuged at 10,000×
