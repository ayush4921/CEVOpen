<p>Five concentrations of the tested EOs (0.1%, 0.2%, 0.4%, 0.6% and 0.8%) were used for toxicity tests and estimation of LC
 <sub>50</sub> values. Fresh leaves from a suitable host plant (pea for 
 <italic>M. persicae</italic> and wheat for 
 <italic>R. padi</italic>) were placed in Petri dishes (20 cm diameter) lined with humid filter paper. Then, 20 aphid females were transferred to the leaves and allowed to settle for two hours. After settlement, the aphids were sprayed with aqueous emulsions of EOs or with a control solution. The solutions were applied with a laboratory sprayer at a rate of 1.5 mL per leaf with aphids. Ten replications were performed for all controls and treatments. Mortality was assessed after 24 h of exposure and LC
 <sub>50</sub> values were calculated using probit analysis. The aphids were considered dead when no movement was observed after gentle prodding with a fine brush.
