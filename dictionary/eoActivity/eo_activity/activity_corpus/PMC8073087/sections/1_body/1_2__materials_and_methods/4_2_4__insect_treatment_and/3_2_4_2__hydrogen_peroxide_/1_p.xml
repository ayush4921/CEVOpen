<p>The content of hydrogen peroxide was determined according to Green and Hill [
 <xref rid="B29-insects-12-00360" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Briefly, 0.3 mL of aphid homogenate was added to 1 mL of reagent (4 mM 4-aminoantipyrine, 24 mM phenol, and 0.4 U/mL of peroxidase dissolved in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0) and the mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 10 min. The absorbance was measured at 510 nm against the blank, which contained extraction buffer instead of the aphid homogenate. The hydrogen peroxide content was calculated from a standard curve prepared with the respective concentrations of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and was expressed in nmol × mg
 <sup>−1</sup> of protein.
