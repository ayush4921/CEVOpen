<p>Superoxide anion content was determined using the nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT), as described by Green and Hill [
 <xref rid="B29-insects-12-00360" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The reaction mixture was prepared by adding 0.5 mL of aphid homogenate to 0.5 mL NBT in 0.2 M phosphate buffer pH 7.8. The changes in absorbance were measured against the blank samples (without NBT) at a wavelength of 490 nm. The reduced activity of NBT by the aphid homogenates was expressed as ΔA
 <sub>490</sub> × min
 <sup>−1</sup> × mg
