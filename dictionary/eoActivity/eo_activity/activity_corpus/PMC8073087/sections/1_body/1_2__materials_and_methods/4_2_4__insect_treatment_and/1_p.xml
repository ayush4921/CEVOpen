<p>Approximately 300 apterous females of 
 <italic>M. persicae</italic> or 
 <italic>R. padi</italic> were caged on pea or wheat seedlings, respectively, and after 2 h the aphids were sprayed with an aqueous emulsion of EO at a concentration of 0.2% (
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) or with a control solution, prepared as described above. The effect of the tested EOs on the level of oxidative stress markers and enzyme activities within aphid tissues was checked 12 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h after exposure. Collected aphids (50 individuals per replicate) were homogenized in 1 mL of ice-cold 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.0 for the superoxide anion (O
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>•−</sup>), hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) and CAT assays; 1% phosphoric acid for the TBARS assay; or in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.8 for the SOD assay. The obtained homogenates were filtered and then centrifuged at 10,000× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 20 min at 4 °C, as previously described by Łukasik and Goławska [
 <xref rid="B20-insects-12-00360" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The supernatants were used for further analyses. All treatments and biochemical assays were replicated independently at least three times.
