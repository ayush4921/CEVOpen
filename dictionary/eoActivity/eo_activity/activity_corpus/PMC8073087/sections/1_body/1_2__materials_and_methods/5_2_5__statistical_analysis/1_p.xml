<p>Probit analysis was conducted to estimate LC
 <sub>50</sub> values with their corresponding 95% confidence limits (CL) by IBM SPSS v. 23 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). LC
 <sub>50</sub> values were considered significantly different when their respective 95% CLs did not overlap. The Kruskal–Wallis test (a nonparametric equivalent of ANOVA) was used to calculate differences in the population parameters of 
 <italic>M. persicae</italic> and 
 <italic>R. padi</italic> after treatment with EOs. Differences in the levels of oxidative stress markers were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA with EO and time of exposure as fixed effects. Analyses were performed separately for each aphid species. The significance of differences between mean values was calculated using Tukey’s multiple comparison post hoc test at 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05. The calculations were carried out using Statistica v. 13.3 software (Statsoft, Poland).
