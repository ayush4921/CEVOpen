<p>EOs were extracted from the aerial parts of 
 <italic>S. chamaecyparissus</italic> and 
 <italic>T. patula</italic>, which are common ornamental plants from the Asteraceae family. The plant material was obtained from our own collection cultures located in Siedlce, Poland (52°17′ N, 22°24′ E, altitude 150 m, average annual rainfall 522 mm). The harvested material was dried in the shade at 25–30 °C and then powdered. Fifty grams of the plant material and 500 mL of water were subjected to water distillation for 3 h using a Clevenger-type apparatus. Anhydrous sodium sulphate was used to eliminate water from the extract. The obtained EOs were filtered and then stored in a sealed glass vials in a refrigerator (4 °C) until further use.
