<p>The activity of SOD was determined using the Beauchamp and Fridovich [
 <xref rid="B31-insects-12-00360" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] method, based on inhibition of formazan formation from NBT in the presence of superoxide radical generators (xanthine and xanthine oxidase system). The reaction mixture comprised 1.0 mL of 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.8, containing 0.15 mM EDTA, 0.1 mL of 7 mM xanthine, 0.1 mL of 0.25 mM NBT and 0.1 mL of enzyme extract. The obtained solution was then mixed with 0.1 mL of xanthine oxidase (0.2 U/mL) in order to start the reaction. Thereafter, change in absorbance was monitored for 5 min at 560 nm. One unit of SOD activity was defined as the amount of enzyme necessary to decrease the rate of NBT reduction to 50% and expressed as U × min
 <sup>−1</sup> × mg
 <sup>−1</sup> of protein.
