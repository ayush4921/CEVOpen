<p>CAT activity was determined according to the Aebi [
 <xref rid="B32-insects-12-00360" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] method. For this purpose, 0.1 mL of the aphid homogenate was mixed with 0.1 mL of 30 mM H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and 0.8 mL extraction buffer. The degradation of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> was monitored at 240 nm for 3 min. The enzyme activity was calculated using molar extinction coefficient (ε = 43.6 M
 <sup>−1</sup> cm
 <sup>−1</sup>), and the results were expressed as μmol of decomposed H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> × min
 <sup>−1</sup> × mg
 <sup>−1</sup> of protein.
