<p>The XRD pattern (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-01612-f001">Figure 1</xref>) shows the presence of strong diffraction interferences that are characteristic for one mineralogical phase, namely magnetite (Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>), as identified from the ICDD (International Centre of Diffraction Data) card No. 19-0629. Six specific diffraction planes corresponding to 2θ values of ~30, ~35, ~43, ~53, ~57 and ~62 (°) were thus identified, namely (2 2 0), (3 1 1), (4 0 0), (4 2 2), (5 1 1) and (4 4 0). The results are in concordance with previously reported data [
 <xref rid="B83-materials-14-01612" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>,
 <xref rid="B84-materials-14-01612" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>] on crystalline magnetite with a spinel cubic structure.
