<p>To identify optimal parameters for MAPLE, the laser processed samples were compared with equivalent dropcast samples by IRM analysis, in terms of purity and stoichiometry (IR spectra), as well as structural integrity and efficient laser transfer (IR maps). For all specimens, IR spectra were recorded for different points on each sample, while the IR maps were built by monitoring the distribution of absorption bands from ~1750 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and ~2990 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, corresponding to carbonyl (C=O) and methyl (–CH
 <sub>3</sub>) groups, respectively. Colors from each IR map are directly related the monitored absorption band’s intensity, ranging from blue to red (minimum to maximum absorbance intensity, respectively).
