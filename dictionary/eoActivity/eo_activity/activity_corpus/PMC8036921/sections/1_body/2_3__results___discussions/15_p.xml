<p>For the biological evaluation of PLA/Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>@EG coatings, the percent of metabolically active stem cells incubated for 72 h in the presence of MAPLE processed samples was determined (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-01612-f010">Figure 10</xref>). The viability of AFSCs was calculated as reported to control cells (non-treated cells). The MTT assay results demonstrate that PLA/Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>@EG coatings are favorable substrates for the normal development of AFSCs, since no modification in the metabolic activity of cells is evidenced after three days of treatment. In comparison with control specimens, a slightly decreased cellular viability (~3%) is noticed in the case of nanostructured composites, but the amount of viable cells is maintained above 92%. Besides their versatile composition and tunable characteristics (including mechanical and thermal response, permeability and solubility), the intrinsic biocompatibility and adjustable biodegradability of PLA-based biomaterials are essential aspects for the development of new and effective antimicrobial formulations [

 <xref rid="B102-materials-14-01612" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. The obtained biological results show that PLA/Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>@EG coatings are highly biocompatible substrates for the normal growth and proliferation of human-derived cells and indicate them as suitable candidates for surface modification of mid-term implantable biomaterials and devices.
