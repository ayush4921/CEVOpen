 <sup>2</sup> laser fluence were evaluated by the plain view and cross-section SEM analysis, respectively. The lower magnification image (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-01612-f009">Figure 9</xref>a) shows a uniform and complete coverage of the substrate by the composite material, with a particulate aspect (suggesting a highly irregular surface) and relatively homogenous aspect. The partial solubility of PLA in DMSO may be responsible for the formation of a continuous polymer layer (with predominant cavity-like structure) and the presence of spherical-shaped particulate structures (occurred due to intense reorganization of polymer following its interaction with the laser beam). At higher magnification (
