<p>In the case of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> strain (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-01612-f011">Figure 11</xref>, left), PLA/Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>@EG coatings determine the decrease of the bacterial population by ~2.5 folds, both after 24 h and 48 h of treatment. It can be clearly noticed that after 72 h of incubation in the presence of composite materials, the CFU/mL values are reduced by three times when compared to control values. Regarding the impact of PLA/Fe

 <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilm development (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-01612-f011">Figure 11</xref>, right), the inhibition level is more evident, since bacterial populations are reduced by at least 10 folds, regardless of the incubation time. These overall results evidence the effectiveness of PLA/Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>@EG composite films as anti-biofilm surfaces.
