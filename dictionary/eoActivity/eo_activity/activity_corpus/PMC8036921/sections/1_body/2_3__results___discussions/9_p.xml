<p>The MAPLE technique gained a lot of attention for the development of biocompatible and biomimetic coatings for implantable materials and devices, thanks to its properties, such as controlled topography of resulted nanosized layers, strong adhesion between synthesized films and implantâ€™s surface, and stoichiometric transfer of target materials onto the substrates [
