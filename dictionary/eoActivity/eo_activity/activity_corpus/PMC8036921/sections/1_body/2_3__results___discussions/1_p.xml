<p>For the synthesis of conjugated iron oxide nanoparticles, we used a modified chemical co-precipitation method, which implied using Fe

 <sup>3+</sup> in a 1.6:1 ratio. The contribution of trivalent cation was smaller to compensate the oxidation of Fe

The organic phase (Eucalyptus essential oil) was introduced in the precipitation medium to form micelles, limiting the nucleation stage of nanoparticles and ensuring a better control of their growth and dimension [
