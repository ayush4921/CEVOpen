<p>The infrared data confirm that composite coatings containing PLA and iron oxide nanoparticles conjugated with EG essential oil were successfully obtained. In terms of chemical integrity and efficient material transfer, the middle laser fluence (300 mJ/cm
 <sup>2</sup>) was experimentally identified as the optimal choice for the MAPLE synthesis of PLA/Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>@EG coatings. Therefore, composite materials for further characterization (SEM investigation) and cellular evaluation (biological and microbiological assays) were obtained only by using this particular value of laser fluence.
