<p>By considering the color distribution from infrared maps (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-01612-f008">Figure 8</xref>, left) and its correlation with materialâ€™s transfer, one can notice that the value of laser fluence has a clear impact on the homogeneity of obtained coatings, which is directly related to functional groups repartition. The lowest distribution of PLA/Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>@EG material onto the substrates (predominantly blue and green areas) is identified for the 200 mJ/cm
 <sup>2</sup> laser fluence (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-01612-f008">Figure 8</xref>a, left), followed by the 400 mJ/cm
 <sup>2</sup> laser fluence (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-01612-f008">Figure 8</xref>c, left). In the first case, this outcome may be related to an inefficient material transfer, as the corresponding IR spectra (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-01612-f008">Figure 8</xref>a, right) evidence the presence of less intense (or even absent) absorbance maxima when compared to the dropcast sample. For the highest laser fluence, the IR spectra (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-01612-f008">Figure 8</xref>c, right) point out significant degradation of previously identified functional groups. The most homogenous and uniform transfer of PLA/Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>@EG material is attained by using the 300 mJ/cm
 <sup>2</sup> laser fluence (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-01612-f008">Figure 8</xref>b, left), with no alterations in the chemical structure of composite material being observed (
