 <sub>4</sub>@EG particles was evidenced after systemic administration and histological evaluation. No morphological alterations, ultrastructural modifications or foreign systems were observed for the brain, myocardium and pancreas tissues, regardless of the treatment period. In comparison, dark-brown aggregates were noticed within capillaries and tissue-specific macrophages of liver and lung (hepatic stellate and pulmonary perivascular macrophages, respectively), at two days after inoculation. The presence of reduced-in-size aggregates was also noticed at the renal level, but only in the blood vessels, as they were absent in glomeruli, renal tubules and renal stroma. Still, no histological alterations were observed in neither of these tissues. After a prolonged treatment (10 days) with proposed nanosystems, the liver, lung and kidney were negative for the presence of Fe
