<p>In the case of Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>@EG sample, a similar thermal behavior pattern was followed: there are three main exothermic events, accompanied by mass reductions. In comparison with the pristine iron oxide sample, the amplitude of the process that occurred at ~300 °C is much higher and comes together with an increased mass reduction (1.92%). This may result from the degradation of the organic molecules from Eucalyptus essential oil, which were conjugated onto the nanoparticles’ surface during the synthesis process. A total mass loss of 3.17% is noticed for the Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>@EG sample. By considering both powdery samples’ thermal data, we can estimate the amount of EG essential oil as 0.36 ± 0.1 wt.%.
