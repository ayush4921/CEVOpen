<p>As a general remark, the inhibition of biofilm development by PLA/Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>@EG coatings is comparable for all investigated time intervals for both bacteria. Such behavior indicates the sustained efficiency of proposed nanostructured materials against microbial biofilm development, as they proved to interfere with the early stage formation of biofilms (contamination and colonization), but also with the maturation phase. The particular anti-biofilm effect evidenced against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> relies on the compositional and microstructural differences between the cells of selected pathogens [

 <xref rid="B104-materials-14-01612" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. Although the exact antimicrobial mechanism is not known, we assume synergistic effects due to EO and magnetite nanoparticles, both with proved antimicrobial activity. The main antimicrobial mechanism of 
 <italic>Eucalyptus globulus</italic> EO is the membrane cell damage and interference with proton pumps and electrolyte channels [

On the other hand, magnetite nanoparticles are known for their cell wall damage properties, as well as stimulation of the intracellular release of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which interfere with vital mechanisms, such as cell division and signaling [
