<p>Relevant microstructural aspects on the Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>@EG particles were provided by transmission electron micrographs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-01612-f004">Figure 4</xref>). A pronounced agglomeration tendency of the powdery sample is noticed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-01612-f004">Figure 4</xref>a), together with the presence of individual nanoparticles that possess no preferential morphology and a non-homogenous aspect. A complementary micrograph (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-01612-f004">Figure 4</xref>b) indicates the quasi-spherical morphology of Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>@EG particles and confirms their nanosize (average diameter of 7.5 ± 2.5 nm). It can also be noticed that the nanoparticles have a good dispersion in alcoholic suspension due to the stabilizing role provided by the phytochemical molecules contained in the EG essential oil. The high-resolution TEM micrograph (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-01612-f004">Figure 4</xref>c) emphasizes a preferential core/shell structure of the synthesized Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>@EG systems, as inorganic nanoparticles of high crystallinity are individually dispersed in low crystalline organic mass. The SAED pattern of EG-conjugated nanoparticles (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-01612-f004">Figure 4</xref>c, inset) confirms the highly crystalline nature of obtained systems, while the identified diffraction planes enable us to categorize the sample as face-centered spinel structured magnetite. These results are in concordance with previously reported data [

 <xref rid="B91-materials-14-01612" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>], and with the above-discussed XRD results. Complementary results evidenced that Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>@EG nanoparticles have hydrodynamic diameters between 200.9 and 247 nm, with negative surface charge (−1.7 mV zeta potential).
