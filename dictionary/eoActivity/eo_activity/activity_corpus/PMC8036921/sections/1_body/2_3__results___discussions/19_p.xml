<p>Herein, the biological results evidence that PLA/Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>@EG coatings are highly biocompatible substrates for human-derived cells. The microbiological data indicate that nanostructured PLA/Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>@EG materials are suitable candidates for anti-biofilm surface modification of short-term to mid-term implantable biomaterials and devices.
