 <sub>4</sub> evidences a total weight loss of 2.81%, which occurred in three steps: (i) the first weight loss, accompanied by an exothermic process, is recorded at 139.2 °C, and is attributed to the evaporation of water adsorbed on the surface of particles (water chemo-desorption); (ii) the second exothermic event (between 300–400 °C) has a lower amplitude, but is correlated with a reduction in the sample’s mass of 1.27%, which may be due to the elimination of absorbed water molecules as a result of the complete degradation of hydroxyl groups from the surface of iron oxide nanoparticles; and (iii) the last exothermic phenomenon comes together with a mass change of 0.73%, and may be attributed to the isomorphic transformation of magnetite into γ-maghemite [
