<p>The present study reports the successful synthesis of PLA/Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>@EG nanocomposite coatings and their potential use as biocompatible and anti-biofilm surfaces for implantable biomaterials and devices. By using a modified co-precipitation protocol, ultra-small (7.5 Â± 2.5 nm) highly crystalline magnetite nanoparticles were conjugated with a natural antibiotic, Eucalyptus essential oil. The MAPLE technique provided an efficient, uniform and stoichiometric synthesis of nanostructured composite thin films. The cellular assays proved that the PLA/Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>@EG coatings did not affect the viability and proliferation of eukaryote cells, while significantly interfered with the formation and maturation of bacterial biofilms. Thus, the proposed PLA/Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>@EG nanocomposite coatings represent suitable candidates for surface modification of implantable biomaterials and devices by enhancing their biocompatibility and inducing or potentiating their anti-infective effects.
