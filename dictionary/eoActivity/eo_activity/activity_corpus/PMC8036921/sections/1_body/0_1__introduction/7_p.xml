<p>Magnetite (Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>) is the most explored representative of iron oxides, with remarkable implications for biomedical use [

 <xref rid="B65-materials-14-01612" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Besides facile and significant yield synthesis, Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> particles possess peculiar nanosize-related features, such as surface functionalization, tunable biocompatibility and superparamagnetic behavior [

 <xref rid="B70-materials-14-01612" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. The surface modification of magnetite nanoparticles with essential oils represents a bidirectional strategy to obtain multifunctional platforms: (i) firstly, the organic molecules act as modulators for the compatibility and stability of Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> nanoparticles; and (ii) secondly, the inorganic core acts as a stabilizer and potentiating agent for the essential oils [

 <xref rid="B72-materials-14-01612" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. By combining these benefits, new and effective therapeutic nanosystems can be provided, with the additional ability of targeted and controlled treatment.
