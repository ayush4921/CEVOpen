<p>For this reason, we report herein the deposition of composite films based on polylactic acid (PLA) embedded with magnetite nanoparticles in situ conjugated with Eucalyptus essential oil (Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>@EG). The chemical co-precipitation method employed in the study offers a high yield reaction and reproducibility in the synthesis of Eucalyptus-conjugated nanoparticles. The embedding of Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>@EG systems within polymeric films of PLA was done to protect the active substance, improve the systemâ€™s biocompatibility, implement a slow release of the active substance, and protect the considered medical device of eventual oxidation and degradation processes. Given the promising data on the matrix-assisted pulsed laser evaporation (MAPLE) method towards the fabrication of bioactive, stoichiometric and homogenous coatings [
