<p>To investigate the purity and crystallinity of synthesized powdery sample, grazing incidence XRD analysis was performed using a PANalytical Empyrean diffractometer (Almelo, the Netherlands) with Cu
 <sub>Kα</sub> radiation (λ = 1.541874 Å), equipped with a 2 × GE (2 2 0) hybrid monochromator for Cu and a parallel plate collimator on the PIXcel3D detector. The scanning was done for 2θ diffraction angles in the 20–80° range, with an incidence angle of 0.5°, a step dimension of 0.04° and a time step of 3 s.
