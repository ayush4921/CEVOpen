 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (
 <italic>E. coli</italic>) and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>) was experimentally evaluated. All samples (uncoated and MAPLE modified glass substrates) were sterilized using 20 min of UV irradiation. Each sample was individually placed in wells of a 6-well plate (Nunc), followed by the addition of 2 mL of Luria-Bertani (LB) broth and subsequent inoculation of 50 Î¼L of microbial suspensions (0.5 McFarland standard densities). After 24h of incubation in standard conditions, the samples were washed with sterile physiological PBS, the culture medium was removed and fresh LB medium was added to ensure the growth of microbial biofilm. After 24, 48 and 72 h of incubation, specimens were washed with PBS and placed into PBS-containing sterile tubes for subsequent vortexing (30 s). The biofilm-forming cell suspensions were diluted and seeded onto solidified LB agar plates in order to evaluate the colony-forming units (CFU/mL). All experiments were performed in triplicate.
