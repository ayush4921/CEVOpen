<p>The as-obtained frozen targets were further irradiated with a KrF
 <sup>*</sup> excimer laser beam (λ = 248 nm, τ
 <sub>FWHM</sub> = 25 ns), using a COMPexPro 205 Lambda Physics source from Coherent (Göttingen, Germany). During MAPLE processing, experimental parameters were set as follows: room temperature and 0.1 Pa pressure inside the deposition chamber, 4 cm target-to-substrate distance, 0.4 Hz and 15 Hz target rotation and laser repetition frequency, respectively. 30,000 laser pulses were applied at different fluences (200, 300 and 400 mJ/cm
 <sup>2</sup>) to obtain PLA/Fe
