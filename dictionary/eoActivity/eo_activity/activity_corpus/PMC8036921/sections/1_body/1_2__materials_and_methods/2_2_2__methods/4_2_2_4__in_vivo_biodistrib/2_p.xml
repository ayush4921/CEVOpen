<p>After 2 days and 10 days of treatment, animals were euthanized under general anesthesia, and internal organs (brain, myocardium, liver, lung, pancreas, kidney and spleen) were harvested. The harvested organs were washed with PBS, preserved in 10% buffered neutral formalin (72 h, room temperature) and prepared for paraffin processing. Serial cross-sections of 4 μm thickness were cut using an HM355s rotary microtome equipped with a waterfall-based section transfer system (MICROM International GmbH, Walldorf, Germany). The as-obtained tissue fragments were placed on histological slides, treated with poly-L-Lysine and the classical Hematoxylin–Eosin (HE) staining protocol was applied. Cross-section tissue samples were examined and photographed with a Nikon Eclipse 55i light microscope coupled with a Nikon DS–Fi1 CCD high definition video camera from Nikon Instruments (Apidrag, Bucharest, Romania). Optical micrographs were captured, stored and processed using the Image-Pro Plus 7.0.0 software from Media Cybernetics Inc. (Buckinghamshire, UK).</p>
