<p>A FEI Quanta Inspect F scanning electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Hillsboro, OR, USA) was used to evaluate the morphology of PLA/Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>@EG films. Prior to analysis, samples were capped with a thin gold layer and the SEM micrographs were recorded using secondary electron beams (energy of 30 keV). For cross-section investigation, the (1 0 0) Si substrates used during MAPLE processing were cut with a diamond disc.
