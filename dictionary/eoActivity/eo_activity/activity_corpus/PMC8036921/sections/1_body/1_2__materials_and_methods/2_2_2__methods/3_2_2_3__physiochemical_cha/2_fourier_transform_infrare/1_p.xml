<p>Compositional aspects on the synthesized powder were obtained using a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrometer (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) connected to the OmnicPicta 8.2 software. To get the FT-IR spectrum, 32 scans were recorded in the 4000–400 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> frequency range, with 4 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> resolution. Scanning was done under a controlled ambient temperature in the attenuated total reflectance mode.
