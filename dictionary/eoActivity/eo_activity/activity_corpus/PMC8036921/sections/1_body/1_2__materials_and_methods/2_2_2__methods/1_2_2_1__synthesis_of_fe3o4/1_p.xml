<p>Magnetite nanoparticles conjugated with Eucalyptus essential oil (Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>@EG) were obtained using a modified chemical co-precipitation method, in compliance with previous studies [

 <xref rid="B76-materials-14-01612" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. In this respect, metallic precursor solution was obtained by dissolving ferric chloride (FeCl
 <sub>3</sub>) and ferrous sulfate (FeSO
 <sub>4</sub>∙7H
 <sub>2</sub>O) in MiliQ. The resulted solution was subsequently added drop by drop within an alkaline solution consisting of 25% ammonium hydroxide (NH
 <sub>3</sub>∙OH), EG essential oil and MiliQ. The process was completed under magnetic stirring, and the resulted precipitate was washed several times with deionized water under magnetic separation. The final product was dried at 40 °C for 6 h, under an inert atmosphere.
