<p>Relevant compositional information on the MAPLE processed materials was pro-vided by IRM analysis, which was made using a Nicolet iN10 MX FT-IR microscope (Thermo Fischer Scientific Company, Waltham, MA, USA). Measurements were recorded between 4000 and 700 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> at 4 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> resolution, in the reflection mode. Thirty-two scans were collected for each sample, then co-added and converted to absorbance using the OmincPicta 8.0 software (Thermo Fischer Scientific).
