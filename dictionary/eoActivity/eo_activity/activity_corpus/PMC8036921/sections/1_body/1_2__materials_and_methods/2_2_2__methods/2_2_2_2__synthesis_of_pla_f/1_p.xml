<p>Before MAPLE processing, all substrates were subsequently cleaned for 30 min with acetone, ethanol and MiliQ in an ultrasonic bath, then dried under a high-purity nitrogen jet. The solid MAPLE targets were prepared by freezing at liquid nitrogen temperature the suspension obtained by mixing poly(D,L-lactide) (PLA) and Fe
