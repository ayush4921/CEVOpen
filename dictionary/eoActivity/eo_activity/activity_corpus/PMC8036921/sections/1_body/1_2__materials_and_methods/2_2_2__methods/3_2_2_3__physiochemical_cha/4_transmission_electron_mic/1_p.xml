<p>Relevant microstructural data on the synthesized particles were provided by TEM analysis, which was performed with a Tecnai
 <sup>TM</sup> G2 F30 S-TWIN instrument equipped with a selected area electron diffraction (SAED) accessory (FEI Company, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Hillsboro, OR, USA). The microscope was used in the transmission mode, at a 300 kV voltage, with point and line resolutions of 2 Å and 1 Å, respectively. For analysis, serial ethanol dilutions were obtained, and the final suspension was placed on a holey carbon-copper grid for investigation.
