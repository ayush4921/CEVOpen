<p>The biocompatibility of composite materials was quantitatively assessed on amniotic fluid-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AFSCs) using the MTT tetrazole (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) viability assay. For biological evaluation, reduced amounts of PLA/Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>@EG were obtained by scratching an area of 0.25 cm
 <sup>2</sup> from the MAPLE-coated glass substrates. All samples were sterilized using UV irradiation.
