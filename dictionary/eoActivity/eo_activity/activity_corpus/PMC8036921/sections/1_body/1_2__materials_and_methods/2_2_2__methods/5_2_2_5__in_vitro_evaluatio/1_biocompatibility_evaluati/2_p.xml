<p>AFSCs were seeded at 3000 cells/well cellular densities in 100 µl of Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic mixture (Penicillin/Streptomycin/Neomycin), using 96-well plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). After 72h of standard incubation (37 ± 2 °C, 5 ± 1% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, humid atmosphere), the viability of cells was quantitatively determined using the Vybrant

 </bold> MTT Cell Proliferation Assay Kit (Thermo Fischer Scientific). Two supplementary dark incubation periods (4h each) were required after the addition of 10 μL of 12 mM MTT solution and 100 μL of SDS-HCl solubilizing solution in each well, respectively. The absorbance values for each specimen were spectrophotometrically measured at 570 nm, using in this respect a Mithras LB 940 instrument (Berthold Technology, Bad Wildbad, Germany). The MTT viability assay was performed in triplicate experiments at different time intervals.
