 <p>The present study reports on the development and evaluation of nanostructured composite coatings of polylactic acid (PLA) embedded with iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe
  <sub>3</sub>O
  <sub>4</sub>) modified with Eucalyptus (
  <italic>Eucalyptus globulus</italic>) essential oil. The co-precipitation method was employed to synthesize the magnetite particles conjugated with Eucalyptus natural antibiotic (Fe
  <sub>3</sub>O
  <sub>4</sub>@EG), while their composition and microstructure were investigated using grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The matrix-assisted pulsed laser evaporation (MAPLE) technique was further employed to obtain PLA/Fe
  <sub>3</sub>O
  <sub>4</sub>@EG thin films. Optimal experimental conditions for laser processing were established by complementary infrared microscopy (IRM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) investigations. The in vitro biocompatibility with eukaryote cells was proven using mesenchymal stem cells, while the anti-biofilm efficiency of composite PLA/Fe
  <sub>3</sub>O
  <sub>4</sub>@EG coatings was assessed against Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens.
