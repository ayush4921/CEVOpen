 <italic>Ficus sycomorus</italic> can act as immunomodulators of the cutaneous response and possess both anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory properties. Plant extracts have been found to have inhibitory effects on the growth of bacteria, viruses, and fungi in in vitro/in vivo studies. Their activities are frequently related to the blockage of the synthesis or function of key components of particular organisms. Moreover, natural compounds may interfere with bacterial resistance mechanisms, disrupting viral attachment and entry into the host [

From these studies, it is evident that plant secondary metabolites demonstrate several reliable biological activities against many diseases and related complications. Certainly, preclinical and clinical research are needed to better understand their pharmacological action, safety and efficacy.
