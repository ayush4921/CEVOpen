<p>Hemp (
 <italic>Cannabis sativa</italic>) is legally defined in the United States (US) [
 <xref rid="B6-animals-11-00892" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and European Union (EU) as any part of the cannabis plant that contains less than or equal to 0.3% THC on a dry weight basis. Hemp has traditionally been farmed for industrial uses (e.g., textiles, paper, biodiesel, constructions materials), as well as for food (hemp seeds and hemp seed oil). Typically, hemp contains relatively high amounts of non-psychoactive cannabinoids. In the US, hemp is not legally recognized as a dietary supplement for either people or animals, nor as a feed supplement for animals, so products labelled as such are illegally marketed [
 <xref rid="B7-animals-11-00892" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Certain varieties of the hemp plant are legally grown in EU under license. The varieties of hemp permitted to be grown are those listed in the EU’s “Common Catalogue of Varieties of Agricultural Plant Species” [
 <xref rid="B8-animals-11-00892" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The term used to describe these varieties is “Industrial Hemp”.
