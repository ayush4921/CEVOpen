<p>Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP of EFSA) delivered a scientific opinion on the safety of hemp (

 <xref rid="B60-animals-11-00892" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Different types of feed materials may be derived from the hemp plant: hemp seed meal/cake, hemp seed oil and whole hemp plant (including hemp hurds, fresh or dried). Further products are hemp flour (ground dried hemp leaves) and hemp protein isolate from seeds. Hemp seed and hemp seed cake could be used as feed materials for all animal species and EFSA defined maximum incorporation rates in the complete feed per species e.g., 3–7% in poultry, 2–5% in pigs for hemp seed and hemp seed cake, 5% in ruminants for hemp seed cake and 5% in fish for hemp seed. Feeding efficacy trials also demonstrate that hemp and its derivates may be included in diets of livestock as a good source of crude protein and essential fats [
