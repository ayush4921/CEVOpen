<p>The Natural Health Products Regulations (NHPR) have been updated to align with the definition of cannabis in the “Cannabis Act” and provide greater clarity about the parts of the cannabis plant that can be included in National Health Products (NHP). Under the updated regulations [
 <xref rid="B76-animals-11-00892" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], which came into effect on October 17th, 2018, NHPs can only contain cannabis parts which either do not meet the definition of cannabis in the “Cannabis Act”, or that have been exempted from the “Cannabis Act” through the “Industrial Hemp Regulations” (IHR) [
 <xref rid="B77-animals-11-00892" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. These ingredients are non-viable seeds or roots of the cannabis plant, mature cannabis stalks without leaves, flowers, seeds, or branches, fibre derived from such a stalk and hemp derivatives that are compliant with the IHR. In addition, the above ingredients must contain &lt;10 ppm (mg/kg) THC, or phytocannabinoids that have been isolated or concentrated. The determination of THC concentration must take into account the potential to convert the acid form into the active form (e.g., delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) into delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)). Any previously approved NHPs (e.g., hemp seed, hemp seed oil, hemp seed protein) would be unaffected by the transition to the new legislative framework and can continue to be marketed as they are now. Applications for NHPs that contain ingredients compliant with the above requirements would be reviewed under the requirements of the Food and Drugs Act and the NHPR.
