<p>Because no antidote has been described to date, the treatment of cannabis toxicosis consists of supportive care [

  <list-item>
   <p>If less than 30 min have passed since consumption, the animal should be decontaminated by inducing emesis and administering activated charcoal and cathartic. Repeated dosing with activated charcoal and cathartic may reduce the elimination half-life of THC by interrupting enterohepatic recirculation.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>If clinical signs have started, inducing emesis might be difficult (due to the psychoactive properties of THC) and could be dangerous if the patient is heavily sedated, as vomit could be inhaled and lead to aspiration pneumonia.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Fluid support and keeping the patient warm may also be needed due to hypothermia. The patient should be rotated frequently to prevent dependent oedema or decubital ulceration.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Diazepam can be given for sedation or to control seizures.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Administer oxygen to assist respiration or relieve respiratory depression, if needed.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Treat central nervous system depression, if needed.</p>

   <p>IV lipid emulsion therapy may be helpful in the treatment of severe cases [

   <p>If the patient has lost consciousness, intense observation and support are needed. The chance of fatality is statistically small but possible.</p>

   <p>Recovery may take 24 to 72 h, or longer (up to 5 days), depending on the ingested dose.</p>
