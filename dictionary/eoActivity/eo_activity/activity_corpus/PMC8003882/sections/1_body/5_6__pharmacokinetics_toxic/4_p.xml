<p>In another pharmacokinetics study, each dog was injected intravenously (cephalic vein) with CBD (90 mg in 2 mL of 70% ethanol). After dosing, the urine volumes were continuously collected for 30 h at intervals of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 22, 26, and 30 h. The apparent terminal plasma half-life (T
 <sub>1/2β</sub>) of CBD from the urine data was significantly shorter than the elimination half-life (T
 <sub>1/2</sub>) of CBD calculated from the plasma data (7–9 h). The T
 <sub>1/2</sub> of all the metabolites was similar to that of CBD indicating that the excretion of these urinary metabolites was formation-rate limited [
