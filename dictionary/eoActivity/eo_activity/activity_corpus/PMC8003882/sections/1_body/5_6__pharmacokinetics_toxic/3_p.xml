<p>In humans, a study on the food effect on the pharmacokinetics of cannabidiol oral capsules administered with and without food in adults with refractory epilepsy, showed that the fat content of a meal can lead to significant increases in the peak serum concentration (Cmax) (14 times higher in the fed state compared to fasting) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC
 <sub>0-u</sub>) (4 times higher in the fed state compared to fasting), Tmax was found to be highly variable within states with the fasting state Tmax ranging from 2 to 5 h and 1 to 6 h for the fed state and therefore can account for variability in bioavailability. Blood samples were collected from an indwelling catheter or venipuncture. During both fed and fasting states, blood samples were collected at predose and at 0.5, 1, 2, 2.5, 3.5, 4, 5, 6, 24, 48, and 72 h. CB doses were 200 mg for one subject and 300 mg for all others during the fed and fasting sessions. Steady state concentrations post 300 mg once daily dose ranged from 4.73 to 40 ng/mL with an average of 21.33 ng/mL [
