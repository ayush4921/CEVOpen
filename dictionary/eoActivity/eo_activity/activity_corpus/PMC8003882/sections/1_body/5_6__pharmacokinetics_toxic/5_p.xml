<p>In dogs, the onset of clinical signs in cases of marijuana toxicosis typically occurs within 30–90 min of exposure and can last up to 96 h [

It is metabolized by liver microsomal hydroxylation and non-microsomal oxidation. THC is highly lipophilic and readily distributes to the brain and other fatty tissues following absorption. Its high lipid solubility contributes to its large volume of distribution (Vd) and long elimination half-life (T
 <sub>1/2</sub>). One pharmacokinetic study investigated the use of a phytocannabinoid-based medicine—Sativex
 <sup>®</sup> (GW Pharma Ltd., Sovereign House, Vision Park, Histon, Cambridge, UK) in dogs which is currently marketed for the treatment of spasticity and pain of multiple sclerosis in humans. It was shown that single or multiple doses administered sublingually to dogs resulted in maximum plasma concentrations of phytocannabinoids at 1–2 h and suggested progressive accumulation after the multiple dose treatment [

Another study carried out in dogs found non-proportional increases in plasma cannabinoid concentrations with increasing oral doses, this as well as potential differences in Cannabis herbal extract product composition and dose regimen consistency, which may all lead to adverse effects [
