<p>Another dog study [
 <xref rid="B82-animals-11-00892" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] administered a cannabis oil extract Bedrocan
 <sup>®</sup> (Bedrocan, Veendam, the Netherlands) (20% delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and 0.5% cannabidiol (CBD)) in fasting and fed dogs at 1.5 and 0.037 mg/kg THC and CBD. Blood samples (1 mL) were withdrawn at 5, 15, 30, 45 min and 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 24, 36, 48, 72 and 96 h after administration of Bedrocan
 <sup>®</sup>. No analytical detectable concentrations of CDB were found at any collection time. THC was quantifiable from 0.5 to 10 h, although there was large inter-subject variability. Fed dogs showed a longer absorption phase (Tmax 5 versus 1.25 h) and lower maximal blood concentration (7.1 versus 24 ng/mL) compared with the fasted group. THC is a lipophilic compound and should have increased bioavailability in the fed condition (bioavailability: 48.22%; fasted no reported) [
