<p>CB1 receptors are located within lipid membranes of presynaptic neurons. They inhibit cAMP and stimulate mitogen-activated protein kinases to modulate the control of ion channels, particularly voltage-activated calcium ion channels and potassium channels. The result is the inhibition of the neurotransmitter release, both excitatory and inhibitory. CB1 receptors also activate phospholipase C and PI-3-kinase. The endogenous ligand for cannabinoid receptors, known as endocannabinoids, are derived from arachidonic acids and are closely related to prostaglandins.</p>
