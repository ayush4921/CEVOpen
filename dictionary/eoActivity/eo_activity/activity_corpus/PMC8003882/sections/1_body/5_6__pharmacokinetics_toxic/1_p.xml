<p>Pharmacokinetics/toxicokinetic parameters are important to consider when evaluating the potential for efficacy/toxicity with varying dose regime (doses, interval, and duration of administration). CBD is a small molecule with a molecular weight of 314.2 g/mol. CBD is highly lipophilic, which raises concerns over potential long-term tissue build-up and toxicity. After a dose of 45 mg of CBD was administered intravenously [
 <xref rid="B79-animals-11-00892" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>], it was rapidly distributed followed by a terminal plasma half-life (T
 <sub>1/2Î²</sub>) of 9 h and a total body clearance (CL) of 0.017 L/h/kg. This study also gave six dogs orally 180 mg of CBD resulting in no analytical detection of CBD in the plasma in three dogs, and an oral bioavailability ranging from 13% to 19% in the other three dogs. The low bioavailability of CBD is due to an extensive first pass or presystemic metabolism in the liver in which CBD and its metabolites are mostly excreted via the kidneys [
