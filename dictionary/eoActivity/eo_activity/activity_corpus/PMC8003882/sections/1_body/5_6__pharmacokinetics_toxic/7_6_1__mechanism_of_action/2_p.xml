<p>Among several that have been identified, the two primary types of cannabinoid receptors are CB1 and CB2, both coupled to G-proteins [

 <xref rid="B89-animals-11-00892" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. CB1 receptors are widely distributed in the brain (central nervous systemâ€”CNS) and correlate with cannabinoid effects on cognition, appetite, emotions, memory, perception and control of movement. An interspecies variation in the anatomical location of the CB1 receptors is seen in dogs. Dogs in particular have a higher density of CB1 receptors in their cerebellum compared to any other species studied [
 <xref rid="B90-animals-11-00892" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. The existence of endogenous cannabinoid receptor agonists has also been demonstrated. These discoveries have led to the development of selective cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptor ligands.
