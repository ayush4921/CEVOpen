<p>Whilst in India in 1843, Irish Physician William O’Shaughnessy noted the widespread use of Indian hemp for a “multitude of afflictions”, he was unable to “trace any notice of the employment of this drug in Europe” [

From his research, he concluded that “there was sufficient evidence to show that hemp possesses, in small doses, an extraordinary power of stimulating the digestive organs, exciting the cerebral system, of acting also on the generative apparatus [

The influence of the drug in allaying pain was equally manifest in all the memoirs referred to.” Inspired, O’Shaughnessy initiated his own studies in animals, administering “majoon”, an Arabic cannabis sweet, to a dog and reporting that “he ate it with great delight” and became “ridiculously drunk” [

Similarly, another dog was given “churrus”, a Nepalese hemp resin, and O’Shaughnessy reported he became “stupid and sleepy, dozing at intervals, starting up, wagging his tail, as if extremely contented; he ate some feed greedily; on being called to, he staggered to and fro, and his face assumed a look of utter helpless drunkenness”. In all cases, the animals recovered and were “well and lively” after a few hours. [
