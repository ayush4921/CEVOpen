<p>The marketing of illegitimate products occurs, particularly when the regulatory framework is not well known and during periods of the rapid expansion of any particular sector. In the EU, all labelling information for CBD feed additives is controlled by EFSA for animal feed and human food, under the Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 [
 <xref rid="B107-animals-11-00892" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>], (EC) No 178/2002 [
 <xref rid="B55-animals-11-00892" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], and Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 [
 <xref rid="B63-animals-11-00892" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The principles behind the legislation are the 100% accuracy of labelling and claims based on scientific evidence. Veterinarians may be the most likely professional group to observe abnormal reactions, for example, psychoactive responses in animals that may have received a defective product (see
