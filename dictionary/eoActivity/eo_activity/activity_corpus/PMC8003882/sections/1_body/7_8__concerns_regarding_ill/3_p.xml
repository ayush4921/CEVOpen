<p>In all regions, the inaccurate labelling of the identity and strength of active ingredients is of particular concern, making administration according to a dosage regimen very difficult to impossible [

In the US, the composition of FDA-approved therapeutic products for humans is known and controlled, but less consistency in quality assurance exists around cannabis sold for medicinal purposes by dispensaries regulated at the state and local levels [
 <xref rid="B109-animals-11-00892" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. Only a few US states have extensive product tracing programs where specific testing methods to confirm the label accuracy of the intended chemical components as well as unintended contaminants are established. Much variation exists in which intended and unintended chemical constituents are analysed, as well as in methods of analysis [
 <xref rid="B110-animals-11-00892" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. Therefore, the label accuracy of cannabinoid constituents and potential contaminants for non-FDA-approved cannabis products may vary considerably within and among US states. Few studies have been done on the safety and tolerability of these products in animals [
