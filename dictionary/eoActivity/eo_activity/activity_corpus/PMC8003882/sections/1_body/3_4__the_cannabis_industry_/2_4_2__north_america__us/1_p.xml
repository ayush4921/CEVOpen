<p>In the US, the cannabis industry was estimated at USD 13.6 billion in 2019 [

 <xref rid="B6-animals-11-00892" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] that de-scheduled “hemp” (defined as 
 <italic>Cannabis sativa</italic> L with ≤0.3% THC on a dry weight basis). As a result, hemp is no longer subject to the restrictions of the US Controlled Substances Act. Many manufacturers have interpreted this to mean that hemp products can now be marketed for human or animal use with no further federal regulation, which is not the case. The US Department of Agriculture has proposed standards for hemp growers and states that wish to apply for licensure so that the hemp supplied to manufactures for CBD production is of known chemical composition [

 <xref rid="B48-animals-11-00892" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. As is the case for the European industry, many cannabis products in the US are marketed with claims of therapeutic efficacy without having gone through the approval process to substantiate those claims and are therefore being marketed illegally. Adding to the confusion is that additional regulation comes into play at the US state level, which may, or may not, be consistent with federal regulation.
