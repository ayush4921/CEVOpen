 <p>The development of new effective anti-coronavirus drugs and therapies is important, but it requires significant human, financial and, most importantly, time expenditures. The current pandemic is neither the first nor the last. Humanity has already accumulated considerable survival experience. We cannot do without prevention and epidemiological protection measures. This study reviews medicinal plants that grow in Northeast Asia and whose antioxidant, antiviral, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory characteristics are already known, also in the framework of the prevention and treatment of pneumonia of various etiologies. The need for a comprehensive approach to maintaining immunodefences, including functional foods and positive emotions, is emphasized. In the period of pandemics, it is important to research various areas that allow to us accumulate a critical mass of information and cope with the next global disease.</p>
