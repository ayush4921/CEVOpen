However, it is vitamin C infusion that has already been tested on patients with pneumonia infected with SARS-CoV-2, and numerous clinical studies are continuing with their relevance maintained [

Products rich in vitamin C traditionally include lemons, oranges, kiwis, guavas and grapes, but it is extremely difficult to cultivate them in Siberia and the Far East.
