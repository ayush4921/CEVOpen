<p id="par0100">The molecular properties including bioavailability and membrane permeability have been linked with many fundamental molecular descriptors like logP (partition coefficient), molecular weight (MW), or number of hydrogen bond acceptors and donors in a molecule. The “rule of five” has been formulated by using these molecular properties [
 <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. It shows that the majority molecules having fine membrane permeability have molecular weight less than or equal to 500, calculated octanol–water partition coefficient, log 
 <italic>P</italic> ≤ 5, hydrogen bond donors less than or equal to 5, and acceptors less than or equal to 10 [
 <xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Hence, Lipinski’s Rule of Five has been used to predict and test the biological availability of properties like absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination (ADME) of the main compounds. In the following research work, citronellol, alpha-terpineol, 
 <italic>o</italic>-cymene, 
 <sc>d</sc>-limonene, eucalyptol, alpha-pinene, and 3-carene obeyed the Lipinski’s rule of five, as well as the compound possess properties of drug likeliness.
