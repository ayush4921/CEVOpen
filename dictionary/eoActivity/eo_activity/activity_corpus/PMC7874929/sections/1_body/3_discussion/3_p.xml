<p id="par0105">Caco-2 cells are made up from human colon adenocarcinoma and contain various numbers of drug transport pathways along with the intestinal epithelium. The predicted Caco-2 values of the compounds shown compounds have moderate intestinal epithelium absorption [

 <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In the following study, the calculated HIA of all compounds was shown to be 100%, which suggests that the compounds can get properly absorbed through the intestinal cell [

 <xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Mostly the strongly bound chemicals are classified as the compounds with more than 90% of PPB while the weakly bound chemicals are classified as the compound with less than 90% of PPB (

The systematic circulation will have less free form of compounds because the predicted value of PPB indicating that all compounds are strongly bound to chemicals except cymene which is moderately bound to chemical. The BBB penetration term finds out whether compounds can move across the blood–brain barrier. Based on the C
 <sub>brain</sub>/C
 <sub>blood</sub>ratio, all chemicals are categorized within three sections – elevated absorption to CNS where C
 <sub>brain</sub>/C
 <sub>blood</sub>value will be more than 2.0, medium absorption to CNS where C
 <sub>brain</sub>/C
 <sub>blood</sub> value is within 2.0–0.1, and low absorption to CNS where C
 <sub>brain</sub>/C
 <sub>blood</sub> ratio value will be below 0.1 [
 <xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The following values are vital in the pharmaceutical sphere because CNS-active compounds should bypass through it and inactive CNS compounds should not surpass across it in order to evade off the side effects of CNS. Except eucalyptol, all the compounds value &gt;2.0 is showing high absorption to CNSP-glycoprotein (P
 <sub>gp</sub>) which is due to result of the multi drug resistance (MDR) gene alongwith an ATP-dependent efflux transporter which affects the assimilation, allocation and emission of medically significant drugs [
 <xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The most important factor of drug discovery is to identify molecules that interact with P
 <sub>gp</sub> transporters, but it is usually confirmed by arduous 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies. However, to predict the likeliness to be substrate for P
 <sub>gp</sub> and the examining of molecules, it can be done through computational classification [
 <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. From the following study, alpha-terpineol, limonene, and alpha-pinene were found to inhibit P
 <sub>gp.</sub> Cytochrome P450 (CYP) which was brought out by the administered drugs that can direct to unwanted effects involved with increase in plasma concentrations or considerable in efficiency of drug [

From the AMES test, all the seven compounds were found to be mutagen and eucalyptol was found to be non-carcinogenic in rat and mouse models. The toxicity hazard and the bioavailability of citronellol, alpha-terpineol, eucalyptol,
