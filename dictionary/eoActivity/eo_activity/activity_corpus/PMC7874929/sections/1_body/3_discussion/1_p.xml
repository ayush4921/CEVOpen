<p id="par0095">Corona viruses have been included under the set of RNA viruses which infect humans as well as some animals, and the recent outbreak of Coronavirus has been induced by beta-coronavirus. The liver, respiratory, digestive, and mostly the focal sensory systems of humans and animals are the infection sites affected due to COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The prime objective for the progress of effective antiviral agents is SARS coronavirus main peptidase (SARS-CoV M
 <sup>pro</sup>) which has a major role in virus as it supports its life cycle in case of COVID-19 infection. The Mpro is been considered as the important and significant protein and also an imperative part which brings about the proteolytic development of the infective virus and also it checks the expanded multiplication of contamination by repressing the cleavage of the viral polyprotein [
 <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The finding of the structure of M
 <sup>pro</sup> has provided a major opening to recognize and identify the potent drug against COVID-19. Hence the following study has aimed the main proteases in Coronavirus (3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>/M
 <sup>pro</sup>) specifically PDB ID 6LU7, as important target proteins for COVID-19 management and treatment. Herbal medicines are been used worldwide for the curing of wide range of diseases either by consuming it or by taking it in the form of drugs. Several essential oil compounds obtained from plant parts have reported to show anti-viral activities [

 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> essential oil has been found to be dependent on the blockage activity of the influenza virus by suppressing the main external proteins. [
 <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Among seven compounds taken for the study, six compounds eucalyptol, alpha-pinene, alpha-terpineol, 3-carene, 
 <sc>d</sc>-limonene, 
 <italic>o</italic>-cymene present in both 
 <italic>E. globulus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. citrodora</italic> in different compositions. The compound eucalyptol found as a major compound in 
 <italic>E. globulus</italic> (52.47%), whereas in 
 <italic>C. citrodora</italic> composition was found as 13.54%. The compound citronellol was major component (59.31%) present in 
 <italic>C. citrodora.</italic> Eucalyptol along with other compounds like alpha-terpinene, gamma-terpinene, alpha-pinene, 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, terpinen-4-ol, alpha-terpineol, thymol, citral obtained from essential oils have shown good potential against (HSV-1) herpes simplex virus type 1 in vitro research, but among all the compounds α-pinene and α-terpineol were slightly superior in their anti-viral activity [
