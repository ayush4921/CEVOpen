<p id="par0110">The inhibition of targeted and main enzyme is caused by knowing the binding affinity and bond formation (hydrogen and hydrophobic) of the most potent molecule. From docking analysis, the compound eucalyptol utilizes slightest binding energy of –5.86 k calorie/mole with M
 <sup>pro</sup> than other compounds. The compounds citronellol and alpha-terpineol form two hydrogen bond interactions with GLU166. Hydrophobic amino acids HIS41, MET165, MET49, and PRO52 residues were found to be key residues that aid in the development of hydrophobic interactions with majority of the compounds. The molecular docking study in this paper showed the inhibition capability of compounds from 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> species and ranked by binding energy (ΔG), eucalyptol &gt; alpha-pinene &gt; alpha-terpineol &gt; 3-carene &gt; 
 <sc>d</sc>-limonene &gt; 
 <italic>o</italic>-cymene &gt; citronellol. The results of this study were consistent with that of Belhassan et al. (2020), who performed molecular docking analysis of the SARS-Cov-2 main protease with oseltamivir derivatives. Hence, the volatile compounds against COVID-9 may work as potent inhibitors of the virus replication and transcription process by inhibiting M
 <sup>pro</sup>, which is a novel CoV enzyme making these compounds as an important drug target and objective for COVID-19 virus [

 <italic>E. globulus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. citrodora</italic>.
