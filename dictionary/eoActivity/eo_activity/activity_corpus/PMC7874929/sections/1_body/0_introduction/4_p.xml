<p id="par0020">As an initial step, it is highly desirable to screen and identify the potentiality of bioactive compounds present in oils of 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> and 
 <italic>Corymbia</italic> against important therapeutic targets of SARS-CoV-2 with the help of molecular docking and its analysis. This will lead towards the progression of novel drug therapies for fighting COVID-19. However, selection of proper therapeutic target is highly crucial for an effective output. There are several therapeutic targets identified and reported for SARS-CoV-2, among which M
 <sup>pro</sup> is âˆ¼306 aa long main enzyme responsible for coronavirus duplication and dispensatings the functional proteins from viral polypeptide [

 <sup>pro</sup> has also been mentioned as 3C-like protease (3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>) as it has the same restriction-site explicitness like picornavirus 3C protease (3C
 <sup>pro</sup>). The main protease (M
 <sup>pro</sup>) from COVID-19 was represented earlier as the latent and important target to stop the replication of CoV [
