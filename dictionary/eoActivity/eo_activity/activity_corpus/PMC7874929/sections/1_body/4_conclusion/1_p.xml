<p id="par0115">Currently, the search for proper medication and vaccine for COVID-19 is in progress. The use of 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> and 
 <italic>Corymbia</italic> species essential oil and the main compounds such as eucalyptol and citronellol has shown positive antiviral action in various research studies. We utilized the recently published 3D structure of M
 <sup>pro</sup> structure from SARS-CoV-2 to predict molecular interaction analysis of volatile compounds from 
 <italic>E. globulus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. citrodora</italic> using Autodock 4.2 software. The docking results attributed various kinds of binding interaction of the drug with M
 <sup>pro</sup> among which some interactions are said to be favourable. Hence, we have suggested that the two species essential oils, and their bioactive compounds mainly eucalyptol may act as possible inhibitor of M
 <sup>pro</sup>, and also further research is essential to explore the possible uses of the 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> and 
 <italic>Corymbia</italic> essential oils and their compounds.
