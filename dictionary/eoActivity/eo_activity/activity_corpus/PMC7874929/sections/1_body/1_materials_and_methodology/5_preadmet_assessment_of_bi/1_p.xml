<p id="par0050">The pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of citronellol, alpha-terpineol, 
 <italic>o</italic>-cymene, 
 <sc>d</sc>-limonene, eucalyptol, alpha-pinene, and 3-carene were predicted using PreADMET server. The pharmacokinetic properties such as Caco-2 values which is an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> cell permeability parameter (Caco-2 cell model), human intestinal absorption (HIA value), plasma protein binding (PPB value), the bloodâ€“brain barrier (BBB) penetration, P-glycoprotein (Pgp) binding parameter, and metabolic parameters (phase 1 and phase 2 enzymes) were carried out using ADME property prediction. In addition, the compounds were virtually screened to calculate and detect the toxicological properties such as mutagenicity, and carcinogenicity using toxicity prediction.
