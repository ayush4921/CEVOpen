<p id="par0045">ACD/ChemSketch is a chemical structure depicting tool that allows us to draw compound structures. The SMILES format of the compounds, namely, citronellol, alpha-terpineol, 
 <italic>o</italic>-cymene, 
 <sc>d</sc>-limonene, eucalyptol, alpha-pinene, and 3-carene were retrieved from PubChem database. The 2D structure was generated through SMILES structure, converted to 3D structure, and 3D optimization was also carried out and saved in MDL-MOL File format and converted in to the PDB format using converter program (open babel) [
