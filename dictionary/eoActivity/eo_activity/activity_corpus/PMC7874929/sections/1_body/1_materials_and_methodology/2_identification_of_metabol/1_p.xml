<p id="par0035">The essential oils of 
 <italic>E. globulus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. citrodora</italic> were analysed using GC—MS analysis according to the method described by Dey and Harborne (1997) with slight modifications. Agilent 7890B gas chromatography system with Agilent 5977B MS detector was employed for compound separation and identification [
 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The settings of GC: the initial temperature of oven was kept at 60 °C for 1 min which was raised at 10 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup> to 180 °C then it kept for 1 min, and increased at 20 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup> to 280 °C and maintained there for 15 min. Carrier gas namely helium was utilized with 1.0 ml min
 <sup>−1</sup> flow rate. Spectrum was recorded with the scan ranges from 20 to 550 
 <italic>m/z</italic> at 2 scans s
 <sup>−1</sup>. The compounds of essential oils were analysed based on alkane series compounds (C4–C28) that determined by their retention time which compared with the chemical constituents grouped by the Adams table [
 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and the mass spectrum which is similar with those of grouped compounds in the NIST-MS library was shown in the article [
