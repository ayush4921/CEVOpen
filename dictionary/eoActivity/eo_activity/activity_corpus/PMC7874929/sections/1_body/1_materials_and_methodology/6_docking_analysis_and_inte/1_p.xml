<p id="par0055">Molecular interaction analysis was carried out to understand the molecular affinity between the compounds, namely, citronellol, alpha-terpineol, 
 <italic>o</italic>-cymene, 
 <sc>d</sc>-limonene, eucalyptol, alpha-pinene, and 3-carene, against M
 <sup>pro</sup> of novel corona virus using AutoDock 4.2. To the 3D M
 <sup>pro</sup> structure of macromolecular structure hydrogen atoms (polar) and kollman charges were added. In the ligand preparation centre node and rotatable bonds were selected and saved in PDBQT format. In the grid preparation, active sites were selected and grids were adjusted with the spacing of 0.375 Å and dimensions of x, y, and z-axes was set to 64 × 66 × 66 points and saved in grid parameter file (GPF) format and run. In docking process, the Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm (LGA) was selected which utilizes local minimisation that enables gene population modification to the complex structures [

The parameters of genetic algorithm were set to 10 runs with 150 population size; the number of evaluations was set to 25,000,000; generation numbers as 27,000 with default mutation rate (0.02) and crossover rate (0.8). Docking simulation was performed by utilizing AutoDock 4.2 version [
