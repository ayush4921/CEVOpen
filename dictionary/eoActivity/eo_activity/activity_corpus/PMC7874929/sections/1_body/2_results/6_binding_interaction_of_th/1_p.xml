 <sup>pro</sup> docking analysis with alpha-terpineol showed two hydrogen bonds with GLU166; three hydrophobic alkyl and pi-alkyl bonds with MET49, MET165, and HIS41 residues; and five van der Waals forces with TYR54, LEU167, GLN189, ARG188, and ASP187 [

 <sup>pro</sup> with 
 <sc>d</sc>-limonene has utilized a energy value of –5.18 kcal/mol and 159.51 μM inhibitory constant and 12 hydrophobic bonds with MET49, PRO52, TYR54, MET165, HIS41, CYS44, and ARG188 and three van der Waals interaction with HIS164, GLN189, and ASP187 residues were formed [

 <sup>pro</sup>-
 <italic>o</italic>-cymene complex formation utilized a energy value of –4.99 kcal/mol and 219.4 μM inhibitory constant and results in seven hydrophobic bonds with MET165, MET49, HIS41 (alkyl and pi-alkyl interactions),and ASP187 (amide-pi stacked interaction) and five van der Waals interactions with PHE181, HIS164, TYR54, GLN189, and ARG188 residues shown in

 <sup>pro</sup> with alpha-pinene utilizes a binding energy of –5.61 kcal/mol and 77.63 μM inhibitory constant and showed seven hydrophobic bonds with PRO168, LEU167, and MET165 and five van der Waals interactions with GLN189, ARG188, THR190, GLU166, and GLN194 residues [
 <xref rid="fig0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> (A)–(C)]. Finally, docking simulation of M
