<p id="par0085">The docking analysis of citronellol, alpha-terpineol, 
 <italic>o</italic>-cymene, 
 <sc>d</sc>-limonene, eucalyptol, alpha-pinene, and 3-carene against M
 <sup>pro</sup> by utilizing AutoDock software 4.2 version. The docking simulation generated 10 conformations of the protein–compound complex which are displayed based on least binding free energy (ΔG). The best conformations were chosen based on the least energy and minimal solvent accessibility. The interactions such as hydrogen, hydrophobic, and other non-bonded terms between the bioactive compounds and M
 <sup>pro</sup> are visualized using Biovia Discovery Studio Visualizer software. The M
 <sup>pro</sup> structure was represented as solid ribbon model, key residues were represented in red colour line model, and the compounds were represented in violet colour ball and stick model is shown in 
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> . The citronellol, eucalyptol, alpha-terpineol, 
 <sc>d</sc>-limonene, 
 <italic>o</italic>-cymene, alpha-pinene, and 3-carene showing hydrogen, hydrophobic, van der Waals interactions within active binding sites of M
 <sup>Pro</sup> are shown in
