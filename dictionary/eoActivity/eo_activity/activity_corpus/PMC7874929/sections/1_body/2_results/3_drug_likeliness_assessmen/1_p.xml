<p id="par0075">The volatile compounds, namely, citronellol, alpha-terpineol, 
 <italic>o</italic>-cymene, 
 <sc>d</sc>-limonene, eucalyptol, alpha-pinene, and 3-carene from 
 <italic>E. globulus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. citrodora</italic> were analysed for molecular properties. All the compounds had molecular weight below 500, hydrogen bond donor ≤5, hydrogen bond acceptor ≤10, and logP value ≤5. Hence, all compounds obey Lipinski’s rule of 5. The PubChem id, 2D, 3D structures, Lipinski’s rule are shown in
