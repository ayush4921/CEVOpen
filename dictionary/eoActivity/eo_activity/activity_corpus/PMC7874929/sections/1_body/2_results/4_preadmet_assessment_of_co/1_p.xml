<p id="par0080">The absorption, metabolism and distribution parameters of citronellol, alpha-terpineol, 
 <italic>o</italic>-cymene, 
 <sc>d</sc>-limonene, eucalyptol, alpha-pinene, and 3-carene were assessed using the PreADMET server. The calculated pharmacokinetic parameters are summarized in 
 <xref rid="tbl0020" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> . The predicted absorption values for Caco-2 cell (PCaco-2) were found to be between 4 and 70. Hence all compounds taken for analysis were moderately permeable. The compounds taken for study can be well absorbed through the intestinal cells as the predicted HIA values for all the compounds was found to be 100%. The predicted value of PPB for citronellol, alpha-terpineol, 
 <sc>d</sc>-limonene, eucalyptol, alpha-pinene, and 3-carene was 100.00%, indicating that the compounds are strongly bound chemicals, whereas cymene has 88.39% indicating it as weakly bound chemical. The ratio of C
 <sub>brain</sub>/C
 <sub>blood</sub> value for eucalyptol was found to be 1.46. All other compounds with a C
 <sub>brain</sub>/C
 <sub>blood</sub> value of greater than 2.0 indicate increase absorption of compounds to CNS, suggesting compounds ability to cross BBB. The compounds such as 
 <sc>d</sc>-limonene, alpha-pinene and 3-carene were found as inhibitors of P
 <sub>gp</sub>, whereas citronellol, cymene, and eucalyptol were found to be non-inhibitors of P
 <sub>gp</sub>. The computed metabolism of compounds showed that citronellol, alpha-terpineol, 
 <italic>o</italic>-cymene, 
 <sc>d</sc>-limonene, eucalyptol, alpha-pinene, and 3-carene are inhibitors of CYP2C9. Other enzyme inhibition details (CYP_2C19, CYP_2D6, CYP_3A4) are displayed in 
 <xref rid="tbl0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The term “negative” suggests compounds having carcinogenic activity and term “positive” suggests absence of carcinogenic activity. It was found that although all compounds found to be mutagenic in the 
 <italic>in silico</italic> AMES test model. Citronellol, cymene, and eucalyptol showed non-carcinogenicity in the mouse model and 
 <sc>d</sc>-limonene, eucalyptol, alpha-pinene, and 3-carene show noncarcinogenicity in the rat model.
