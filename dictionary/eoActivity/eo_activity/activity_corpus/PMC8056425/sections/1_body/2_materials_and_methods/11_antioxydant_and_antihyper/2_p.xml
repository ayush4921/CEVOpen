<p id="p0180">Antioxydant activities of CSAO oil were performed spectrophotometrically by measuring linoleic acid/Î²-carotene bleaching activity [
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging activity [
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and ferric reducing power [
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] as described previously. BHA was used as a reference standard. The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity was carried out by measuring the hydrolysis rate of hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine (Hip-His-Leu) as substrate using the spectrophotometric method [
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. IC
 <sub>50</sub> values denote the half maximal inhibitory sample concentration.
