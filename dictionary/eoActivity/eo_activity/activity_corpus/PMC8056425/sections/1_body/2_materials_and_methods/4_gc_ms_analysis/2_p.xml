<p id="p0140">Fatty acid methyl esters, prepared as previously described [
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) using a Shimadzu GC-2010 gas chromatograph. The fused fatty acid methyl esters column (30 m × 0.25 mm id, film thickness 0.25 μm; Supelco, USA) was coupled to a Shimadzu QP 2010 Plus mass-spectrometer (Shimadzu, Japan). The oven temperature was programmed at 50 °C for 1 min, then 25 °C/min to 200 °C, then 3 °C/min to 230 °C, and then left at 230 °C for 21 min. The injection port temperature was 250 °C and that of the detector was 220 °C (split ratio 1/5). Helium was the carrier gas with a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min. Mass spectrometer parameters were set at 70 eV ionization voltage, 200 °C ion source temperature and spectra acquisition over the 35–500 m/z mass range. Compounds were identified based on the Wiley registry of mass spectral data.
