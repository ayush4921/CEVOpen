<p id="p0165">IR data were acquired with a Nicolet™ iS™ 10 FTIR Spectrometer equipped with a DTGS detector (Thermo Scientific, USA). IR spectra were recorded at 20 °C with 256 interferograms at 4 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> resolution each and then Fourier transformed. During data acquisition, the spectrophotometer was continuously purged with dry filtered air (Balston regenerating desiccant dryer, model 75-45). For IR measurements, CSAO and standard trans-anethole were deposited on CaF
 <sub>2</sub> windows.
