<p id="p0145">The analysis of CSAO triacylglycerols (TAGs) was performed according to the official chromatographic method of the Equivalent Carbon Number (ECN) which is formulated as ECN = CN - 2n; where CN is the number of carbon atoms of the fatty acid of the TAG and n is the number of double bonds of the TAG molecule [

The TAGs profile was obtained by a chromatographic system (HP1100, Agilent Technology, Germany) equipped with a differential refractometer detector and a Spherisorb analytical column (250 mm × 4.6 mm, Supelco, USA). The separation was conducted by an isocratic elution with acetone/acetonitrile mixture (60:40) at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min and an injection volume of 20 μL of the oil dissolved in acetone. TAGs were identified based on standard TAGs.
