<p id="p0175">Enzymatic activity was assayed by measuring the amount of free fatty acids (FFAs) released from a mechanically stirred oil/gum arabic emulsion using 0.1 M NaOH with a pH-stat (Metrohm 718 STAT Titrino, Switzerland) at a constant pH value of 8.5 and at 37 °C [
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. 10% w/v oil emulsions in 10% w/v gum arabic were prepared using a warring blender. The reaction mixture (15 mL final volume) was prepared by mixing 5 mL of the 10% w/v oil emulsion with 10 mL of the lipase assay buffer. The pancreatic lipase activity was assayed in the presence of 4 mM sodium taurodeoxycholate (NaTDC), 1 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> and a molar excess of colipase [

 <sub>2</sub> [
