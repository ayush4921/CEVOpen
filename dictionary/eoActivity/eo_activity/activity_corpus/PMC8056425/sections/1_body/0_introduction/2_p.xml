<p id="p0010">Drugs formulation is carried out with the main objective of enhancing their bioavailability. Lipid-based drug delivery systems showed great potential in overcoming problems of low bioavailability of poorly soluble drugs. Encapsulating lipophilic drugs in lipid excipients might lead to increased solubilization and prevent precipitation during the gastrointestinal passage, thus resulting in enhanced absorption and bioavailability of poorly soluble drugs. Recent advances in these formulation technologies have led to the successful commercialization of lipid-based drug delivery systems [

Lipid formulations currently used for the oral delivery of poorly water-soluble drugs consist of esters, such as acylglycerols, phospholipids, polyethyleneglycol esters and polysorbate, that could be hydrolysed by gastrointestinal lipolytic enzymes, which might affect poorly water-soluble drugs bioavailability [
