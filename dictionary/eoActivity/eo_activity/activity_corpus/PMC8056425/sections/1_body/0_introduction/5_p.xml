<p id="p0025">Chinese star anise (CSA), the seedpod of an evergreen tree (
 <italic>Illicium verum</italic>) grown in East Asia, is an edible fruit that has been commonly regarded as being safe and nontoxic. It is widely used as a spice and in traditional medicine [

 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Most previous studies were focused on the fruit peel essential oil, but there is not enough information on the whole seedpod unconventional oil of Chinese star anise (CSAO). The main objective of this work is to assess the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> gastrointestinal lipolysis of unconventional CSAO oil for the development of new lipid-based drug delivery systems. Moreover, we studied the ability of CSAO to exhibit additional pharmacological properties, e.g., antioxidant and antihypertensive activities, that might strengthen its potential role as a multifunctional lipid excipient.
