<p id="p0015">Developing a mechanistic understanding of the impact of food structure and composition on human health has increasingly involved simulating digestion in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Simulated gastrointestinal digestion is widely employed in many fields of food and nutritional sciences, as conducting human trials are often costly, resource intensive, and ethically disputable. Therefore, simple 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> digestion models mimicking the gastrointestinal tract have been proposed as alternatives to 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments. Despite the simplicity of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> digestion models they are often very useful in predicting outcomes of the digestion
