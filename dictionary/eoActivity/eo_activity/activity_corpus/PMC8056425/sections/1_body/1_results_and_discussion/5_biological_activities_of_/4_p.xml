<p id="p0120">CSAO oil exhibits moderate DPPH free radical scavenging, ferric ions reducing and anti-lipid peroxidation activities in a concentration-dependent manner with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 7.7 mg/mL, 6.5 mg/mL and 13.5 mg/mL, respectively (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>A, B and C). Similar results were reported for star anise petroleum ether extract [
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Trans-anethole however has poor antioxidant properties, as reported previously [
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Thus, trans-anethole is not the principal compound that triggers CSAO antioxidant activity. Antioxidant properties of CSAO could be attributed to minor components, as suggested previously [
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Therefore, in addition to its basic function as alternative lipid excipient with outstanding resistance to gastrointestinal lipolysis, the unconventional CSAO oil might have additional beneficial biological properties, i.e., antioxidant and antihypertensive activities, reinforcing its emerging role in designing new lipid formulations for the oral delivery of lipophilic drugs.
