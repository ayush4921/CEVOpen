<p id="p0075">Spectroscopy is an accurate and rapid way to establish the authenticity of vegetable oils [
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. UV-visible measurements in the range of 230–700 nm show that CSAO UV absorption spectrum is characteristic of trans-anethole with a major peak located at 258 nm (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A), which is in good agreement with previous trans-anethole analysis [

 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. CSAO and standard trans-anethole show similar IR spectra at the range of 3800–750 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> with varying intensities (data not shown). CSAO spectrum exhibits however distinguishable peaks at the range of 1780–1660 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> that can be interpreted as the ester carbonyl of TAGs bearing unsaturated fatty acids (
