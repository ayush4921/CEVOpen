 <italic>In vitro</italic> models have been widely used to overcome the constrictions associated with 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> methodology [
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It is generally assumed that pancreatic lipase (PL) is the main enzyme involved in the gastrointestinal lipolysis of oils and fats. PL has been widely used for the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> simulation of duodenal lipolysis [
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. We studied the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> pancreatic lipase-mediated lipolysis of CSAO oil emulsion, without any poorly water-soluble drug, in comparison with other vegetable oils emulsions. Based on the initial velocity of TAG hydrolysis, PL specific activity was found to be 335 U/mg on CSAO, i.e. 16-, 8- and 5-fold lower than the maximum activity measured using olive, corn and sunflower oils, respectively, under the same conditions (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>A). PL low specific activity on CSAO would be related to differences in fatty acids composition and TAGs intramolecular structure of investigated oils. In terms of fatty acids composition, the oleic acid, which is predominantly present in EVOO (62.4 %) [
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], is known to be rapidly and preferably hydrolyzed by PL [
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. While, the linoleic acid, which was predominantly present in corn and sunflower oils (55.9 % and 61.5 %, respectively) [
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], has more steric requirements to be hydrolyzed due to its higher number of unsaturation [
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In terms of TAG intramolecular structure, OOO is the major TAG species in olive oil and to lesser extent POO and OLO [
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Accordingly, the predominance of oleic acid in the 
 <italic>sn</italic>-1 and 
 <italic>sn</italic>-3 positions in olive oil TAG could explain the high activity of PL towards EVOO. Similarly, the predominance of linoleic acid in the external positions of the major TAG species of corn and sunflower oils [
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] could explain the lower PL activity towards these two vegetable oils when compared to EVOO. Although TAGs species of CSAO are not identified yet, they would certainly differ from the two other investigated vegetable oils models (dominated with oleic and linoleic acids). Accordingly, the resistance of CSAO oil to PL lipolysis would be attributed to the strict 
 <italic>sn</italic>-1,3-regioselectivity of PL, as well as to the steric hindrance caused by polyunsaturated fatty acids at the TAGs external carboxyl ester bonds [
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].
