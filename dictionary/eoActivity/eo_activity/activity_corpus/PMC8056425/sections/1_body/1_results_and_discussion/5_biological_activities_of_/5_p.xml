<p id="p0125">To our knowledge, this is the first report that tentatively identified the unconventional star anise whole seedpod oil as a promising multifunctional excipient for the development of new lipid-based drug delivery systems. However, the fact that 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> gastrointestinal lipolysis assays were performed without any poorly water-soluble drug will have to be considered in further studies to elaborate 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> data as predictive as possible of the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> digestibility of lipid excipients. This said, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> formulation performance criteria require careful interpretation for understanding of 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> performance in the complex and dynamic environment of the gut.
