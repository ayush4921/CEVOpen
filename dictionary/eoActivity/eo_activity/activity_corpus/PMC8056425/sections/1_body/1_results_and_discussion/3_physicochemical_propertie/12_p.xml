<p id="p0085">Acidity, an indicator of FFAs content, and the iodine value, reflecting the unsaturation degree, are important parameters to evaluate vegetable oils quality. The CSAO acidity (3.54 % of oleic acid) is higher than the standard threshold (Codex Standards for Fats and Oils), indicating that this oil is not suitable for direct consumption and requires refining process for edible purposes. Olive oil, being rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (C18:1), has iodine values in the range of 75–90, while corn and soybean oils, being rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (C18:2), have iodine values ranging from 120 to 140 [
