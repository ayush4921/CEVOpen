<p id="p0105">It is assumed that fast lipolysis of triglyceride-based oral lipid formulations by gastric and pancreatic lipases can lead to premature release of poorly water-soluble drugs, and therefore drug precipitation in the gastrointestinal lumen followed by reduced intestinal absorption [

 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Slowing down lipid excipients lipolysis might therefore significantly enhance the bioavailability of lipophilic drugs. However, since lipolysis products, i.e. fatty acids and monoglycerides, are known to trigger certain lipophilic drugs absorption [
