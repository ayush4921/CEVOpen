<p id="p0100">In line with this finding, we checked whether CSAO could be hydrolyzed 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> by the non-regiospecific (or random) 
 <italic>Candida antarctica</italic> B lipase (Novozyme® 435). Based on the initial velocity, Novozyme® 435 exhibited higher activity than pancreatic lipase on CSAO emulsion, the enzyme amount in both cases being equivalent to 10 units on olive oil emulsion. One could plausibly suggest that this might be attributed to Novozyme® 435 ability to release fatty acids from the internal 
 <italic>sn</italic>-2 position of TAGs (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B). It has been reported that oleic acid occurs mainly at the 
 <italic>sn</italic>-2 position of vegetable TAGs [
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Therefore, oleic acid, which accounts for 35.72 % of total CSAO fatty acids (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), would rather occupy the internal 
 <italic>sn</italic>-2 position of CSAO TAGs species. Moreover, the olive oil to CSAO activity ratio of Novozyme® 435 was found to be around 1, clearly indicating that pancreatic lipase-mediated lipolysis is not affected by the physical properties of the CSAO emulsion, such as particle size, but rather by fatty acids composition and TAGs intramolecular structure, i.e., the positional distribution of fatty acids on the glycerol backbone, as it has been reported previously [
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].
