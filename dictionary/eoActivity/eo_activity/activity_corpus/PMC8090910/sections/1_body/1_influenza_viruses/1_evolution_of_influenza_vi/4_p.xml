<p id="Par8">The first detection of influenza viruses dates back to the sixteenth century, during the Russian influenza pandemic. Generally, influenza viruses transmit from their primitive hosts to their intermediate ones to ensure better evolution and subsequent transmission. Not long ago, the infection landscape of influenza has expanded widely to include previously unhabituated hosts such as whales, seals, and bats. Influenza A for example, affects a wide range of mammalians including pigs, dogs, seals, cats and humans, where the latter become an intermediate host for numerous viruses [

Viral infections largely take two routes: the first one is the isolated route or the unsustainable infection, where the microbe fails to adapt or evolve in its new host such as Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome and Ebola disease. In the second route the virus (e.g. influenza) adapts in the intermediate host, and successfully transmits to a new environment, leading to durable establishment that can resist any harsh environment posed by the end host [

Viral factors include the ability to produce adaptive mutation proteins, such as HA glycoprotein, PB2, NP and NS1 proteins. Other viral factors are its interconnectivity and population size. Host determinant factors represented by the presence of target receptors or the availability of innate immune response factors [
