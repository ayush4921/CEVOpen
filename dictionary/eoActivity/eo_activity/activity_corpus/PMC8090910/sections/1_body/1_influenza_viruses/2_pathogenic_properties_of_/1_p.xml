<p id="Par9">Almost all human respiratory infections come from influenza viruses, which have been around since the middle ages. They infect infants, people with chronic diseases, causing them high illness and demise. For example, in 1957 in a seasonal epidemic of influenza A, nearly two hundred thousand Americans were hospitalized, of which 15% died [

However, associated health conditions (bacterial pneumonias) of infected population, seems to vary from infections to infections. The 1918 influenza pandemic for example, has caused high fatality frequency in young adults compared to elderly people, contrasting the two previous pandemics, where high mortality rate occurred in elder people and cases with chronic disease history [

Largely, influenza viruses adapt to new environments via changing their surface proteins. These changes are either accumulative or straightway. The former occurs due to limited mutations in hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) antigens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Accumulative changes happen every time the virus replicates, and normally produce types that are closely related to the original one, therefore they have analogous antigenic properties, that trigger similar response from the host immune system, resulting in cross protection. However, over time this process can result in strains that are antigenically diverse. A small mutation in one important domain that has a huge impact on virus antigenic properties, can lead to antigenic deviation. This will change the virus to the point that the body’s immune system cannot recognize these newer antigens, and ultimately become susceptible to infection again. This is one of the main reasons why one can be infected with influenza virus many times [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. On the other hand, straightway changes or shift changes that cause the creation of novel NA and HA proteins, resulting in newer types of influenza A. Such shifts happen when viruses from different hosts (e.g. mammalians) acquire new virulence ability to infect the human body, which has no immune defence against such virus types due to differences in their antigenic proteins. The H1N1 virus pandemic in 2009 is an example of this sort of shift, when it moved from its original host swine to humans. However, such intraspecies changes are less frequent compared to the interspecies ones [
