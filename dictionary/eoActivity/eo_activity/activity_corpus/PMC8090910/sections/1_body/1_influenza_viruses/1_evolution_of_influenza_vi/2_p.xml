<p id="Par6">They are classified into four main types: Alpha influenza (A), Beta influenza (B), Gamma influenza (C) and Delta influenza (D) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A and B are known as seasonal viruses or the so called “human influenza”, they mainly cause seasonal flu epidemics, yet influenza type A is the only one that has caused influenza pandemics to date—epidemics develop to pandemics when new strains of microbes infect people and can spread globally. While type C is responsible for mild symptoms in human, with limited spread ability, type D mainly infect cattle [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. According to proteins Neuraminidase (N) and hemagglutinin (H) that are attached to their surface, viruses can be divided into many subgroups. N includes 11 subtypes and H includes 18 subtypes. Nearly 198 subtypes of influenza virus A have been predicted, of which 131 subtypes have been confirmed. Types that frequently infect people are, influenza A(H1N1) and influenza A(H3N2). The latter has the tendency to change its genetic material rapidly. Like type A, influenza type B is classified into two subgroups; Yamagata and Victoria which are further divided into many subclades (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Cases of co-circulation of both subgroups were reported around the world, however, with variable geographical distribution of each subgroup. Generally, the genetic material of type B is more stable than type A in terms of rate of changes/mutations [
