<p id="Par23">Undoubtedly, current computational genome sequencing, have effectively pushed the medical search generally and infectious disease search particularly, towards further understanding of the interaction between the microbial or viral communities and the human body, and determine their virulence or symbiosis at the molecular level. However, despite this progress in the genomic era, infectious diseases still cause high frequency of illness and mortality among populations, especially in the developing countries. It is therefore vital for those countries to strengthen the input of bioinformatics in such field of research, through more well-designed training, internship courses and collaboration with more developed specialised institutions around the globe, to help to control the spread of contagious diseases worldwide.</p>
