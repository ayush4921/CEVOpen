<p id="Par22">The recent advances in genetic tools, molecules structure modelling, and large-scale screening, established the guidelines for the discovery of novel antibiotics against infectious diseases. Current strategies involve, but are not limited to, two approaches. One is to characterise or improve drugs against known microbes. Ideally this method can be expanded to involve different types of viruses including the drug resistant ones. Second, is the validation of new targets in both the host and the virus, to accordingly develop novel classes of molecules, via either structure-based molecule interaction, or host transport machineries. The viral polymerase, for example, is an internal protein that can be further exploited according to its structure interaction with new molecules. Targeting the transportation system of the host cell, it can also provide a new avenue for virucide development, especially for viral RNPs, however, potential intrusion with the metabolic system of the host should be considered.</p>
