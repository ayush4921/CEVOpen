<p id="Par21">Even though influenza viruses are of relatively old origins and very contagious, the currently used antivirals are undoubtedly limited in terms of their bioactivity spectrum and sources. What makes things even more concerning and further intensifies the need for new strategies in virucide discovery, is the constant increase in antimicrobial resistance. Typical antibiotic discovery was and still involves the isolation, characterisation, and testing methods against panels of pathogenic bacteria, without considering the presence of other life-threatening germs, which are viruses in this case. Lately, several literature reports described the antiviral activity of a variety of volatile compounds against some viruses including influenza. We therefore attempted to provide a brief outline on influenza virus structure, evolution, pathogenicity and then suggest terpenes as potential sources to develop antivirals. Our literature search showed that viruses can be virulent and destructive in many levels and difficult to control unless urgent innovative policy is made in the drug discovery field. It also highlighted terpenes as potential antivirals due to the natural sustainability they demonstrated when tested against many viruses.</p>
