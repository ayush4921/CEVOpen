<p id="Par11">Although recent flu epidemics were less incurable compared to past epidemics, there is still an urgent need to search for new approaches to prevent flu pandemics, especially the ones caused by the influenza A. Unlike bacteria, viruses cannot reproduce in the absence of a living host. Once they are inside the host cell, they hijack its replication machinery, and some of them start replicating, then they eventually burst open the cell and infect more host cells [
