<p id="Par16">Research on essential oils extracted from plants, demonstrated the dominance of terpene-like compounds. particularly monoterpenes and triterpenes, as they represented more than 95% of the chemical constituents of those oils [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. We, therefore, further searched for promising antiviral terpenes characterised in plants and presented them in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. These include eugenol (molecular formula C
 <sub>10</sub>H
 <sub>12</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>), a volatile phenolic compound with antiviral properties, which represents an essential constituent of clove oil [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Germacrone, formula C
 <sub>15</sub>H
 <sub>22</sub>O, is the sesquiterpene constituent of the essential oil of many globally distributed plants and shows inhibition activity on the influenza virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Patchouol, formula C
 <sub>15</sub>H
 <sub>26</sub>O, is a sesquiterpene alcohol mainly found in patchouli plant leaves, and has shown promising results as an inhibitor of influenza viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Interestingly, this compound is also used as a precursor in the synthesis of the anticancer compound taxol. β-santalol, formula C
 <sub>15</sub>H
 <sub>24</sub>O, is another example of a sesquiterpene type compound, found in 
 <italic>Santalum album</italic>, in which it represents one fifth of the total plant essential oil [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Terpinen-4-ol and α‐terpineol, both with chemical formula C
 <sub>10</sub>H
 <sub>18</sub>O, are components of the essential oil of the tea tree and many other aromatic plants, and they show antiviral activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Terpinolene belongs to the group of monoterpenes, with chemical formula C
 <sub>10</sub>H
 <sub>16</sub>, and can be naturally sourced from different plants, such as cardamom.
