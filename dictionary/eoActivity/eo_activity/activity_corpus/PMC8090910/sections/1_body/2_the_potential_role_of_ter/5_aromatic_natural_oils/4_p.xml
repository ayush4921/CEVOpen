<p id="Par19">Terpenes are a large class of natural metabolites that comprise over two thirds of all known secondary metabolites. They are biosynthesised by most living organisms including plants, fungi and bacteria, however many of these compounds investigated by scientists are from plants or mushroom-forming fungi [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Compared to the current knowledge of chemicals produced by fungi, little is known about their synthesis and function—especially for terpenes. The antagonistic or synergistic interactions of those natural substances with other chemical or biological elements, can negatively influence their therapeutic properties. It is, therefore, important to use well-defined molecules in terms of organism, enzymes, biosynthesis routes and activity. Since those biologically interesting terpenes are produced in small quantities by their native organisms, there is a reasonable need to thoroughly investigate their synthesis via combinatorial pathways—as classical chemical synthesis proved ineffective in terms of purity and environmental impact of catalysts—and in the presence of selective enzymes and affordable simple terpenes, such as pinene and limonene [
