<p id="Par13">Generally, antiviral drugs have been designed to stop viruses from inserting their viral genomes into the host cell, as well as to avert the new copies from infecting other host cells. Ganciclovir and acyclovir, for example, are designed to inhibit the synthesis of the viral DNA of cytomegalovirus and simplex virus, respectively [

Besides that, many species of influenza virus have developed resistance to the currently used medications, as such, more viral genome specific drugs are needed, to kill a specific virus, or control the spread of similar ones [
