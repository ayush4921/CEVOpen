Cancer has been a continuing health problem in the medical sciences globally, with a lot of developments achieved in the treatments of this chronic disease via use of different preventive and curing therapies. The disease is characterized by the continuous multiplication of the human body cells, with the inability to be controlled or stopped, and the consequent formation of malignant cell tumors with the potential to be metastatic [
