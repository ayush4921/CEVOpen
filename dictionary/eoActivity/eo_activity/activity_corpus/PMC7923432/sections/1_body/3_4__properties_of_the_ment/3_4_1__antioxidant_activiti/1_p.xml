<p>There is increasing interest in the utilization of plant-based natural antioxidants due to their safer nature and medicinal benefits compared to synthetic formulations. In this regard, extracts and essential oils (EOs) from many medicinal and food herbs have been investigated as promising source of effective antioxidant agents [
 <xref rid="B80-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] showing a well-known action against reactive oxygen species and free radicals. A range of in vitro antioxidant assays such as (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) (DPPH) radical scavenging [
 <xref rid="B81-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>], 2,2’-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS+) inhibition of linoleic acid peroxidation [
 <xref rid="B82-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>], and reducing power [
 <xref rid="B83-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>] assays have been successfully employed by the researchers to examine the antioxidant effects of 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> plants. Numerous medicinal plants, including the 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> genus, contain high levels of antioxidants including phenolic compounds, ascorbic acid and carotenoids that can delay or inhibit the oxidation of different molecules [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]; for example, phenolic compounds act as free radical scavengers and inhibit lipid peroxidation [
 <xref rid="B84-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Notably, the oxidation products such as hydroxyl radicals are extremely reactive oxygen species (ROS) that interact with all kinds of biological molecules within their vicinity and cause cellular damages potentially leading to acute or chronic diseases, including cancer [
 <xref rid="B85-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>,
 <xref rid="B86-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Among the several studies carried out on the antioxidant potential of 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> species, Park et al. reported that out of nine 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> species 
 <italic>M. longifolia</italic> was the most effective one, showing a 88.6% antioxidant activity compared to the 93.0% activity of ascorbic acid at a concentration of 100 µL/mL, whereas 
 <italic>M. suaveolens</italic> ‘Variegata’ (pineapple mint) had no antioxidant activity [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In contrast, in another study [
 <xref rid="B82-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] the order of DPPH scavenging activity level was as follows: 
 <italic>M. piperita</italic>, 
 <italic>M. pulegium</italic>, 
 <italic>M. rotundifolia</italic>, 
 <italic>M. spicata</italic> and 
 <italic>M. longifolia</italic>. Numerous factors are implicated in these apparently conflicting results, for example cultivation methods vs wild harvest of plants, type of laboratory investigations or extraction methods, etc. Without a standardized approach it is not possible to define the consistency of comparisons among different works. It was reported that 
 <italic>M. aquatica</italic> has the highest phenolic, flavonoid and tannin contents as well as the highest antioxidant activities [
 <xref rid="B87-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. In vitro studies showed that the 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol soluble fraction derived from a methanolic extract of 
 <italic>M. spicata</italic> at 10 µg/mL exhibited a significant protective activity against DNA damage caused by free 
 <sup>·</sup>OH radicals [
 <xref rid="B88-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Differently, Bahadori et al. found that 
 <italic>M. longifolia</italic> showed the highest phenolic content and antioxidant activity [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].
