<p>Dzamic et al. showed that 
 <italic>Mentha longifolia</italic> essential oil (MLEO) was an effective DPPH free radical scavenger and exhibited scavenging activity in a dose-dependent manner (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.66 mL/mL of solution) [
 <xref rid="B89-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Similarly, MLEO reduced DPPH radicals to their neutral DPPH-H form (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 10.5 μg/mL) [
 <xref rid="B90-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Moreover, it has been observed that extract of naturally dried 
 <italic>M. longifolia</italic> had higher content of phenols (113.8 mg GAE/g) and flavonoids (106.7 mg RTE/g) than the laboratory oven-dried samples. Similarly, a higher antioxidant activity, in terms of ferric reducing power and DPPH scavenging, was also reported for the naturally dried extracts (2.76 mmol Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>/mg and EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.02 mg/mL) compared with the laboratory oven-dried samples (1.13 ± 0.11 mmol Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>/mg of dry extract and EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.03 mg/mL) [
 <xref rid="B91-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. This suggests that processing of 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> plants under appropriate conditions is a key step to retain their maximum antioxidant value. In another study, the superoxide radical scavenging activity of different solvent fractions of 
 <italic>M. spicata</italic> were investigated, showing that the ethyl acetate and aqueous fractions of ethanol extract of 
 <italic>M. spicata</italic> had higher superoxide radical scavenging among others [
 <xref rid="B81-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. According to Anwar et al., MLEOs of different chemotypes, harvested in different regions of Saudi Arabia, exhibited a reasonably high extent of DPPH free radical scavenging that was mainly correlated to the variable polyphenols and carvone contents of the tested oils [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Saba and Anwar evaluated the effect of harvesting regions on physico-chemical and biological attributes of supercritical fluid-extracted spearmint (
 <italic>Mentha spicata</italic> L.) leaves EO [
 <xref rid="B92-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. The researchers noted that the oils tested effectively scavenged DPPH free radicals as well as inhibited linoleic acid peroxidation depending upon variable contents of total phenolics and flavonoids. In another study carried out by Ed-Dra et al., 
 <italic>Mentha suaveolens</italic> EO showed a significant ferric reducing antioxidant potential and DPPH free radical scavenging activity [
 <xref rid="B93-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Dhifi et al., reported that essential oil of 
 <italic>Mentha spicata</italic> showed high activity against 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, as well as Gram-negative cells of 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp. and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> [
 <xref rid="B94-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Sokovi’c et al. also reported that menthol was more active than other compounds extracted from tested plants: linalyl acetate, limonene, β-pinene, α-pinene, camphor, linalool and 1,8-cineole [
 <xref rid="B95-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Singh et al., reported the antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>M. piperita</italic> measured by evaluating its antioxidant capacity, DPPH free radical scavenging activity and reducing power. A chloroform extract and peppermint oil showed antioxidant potency of about 90% and minimum activity was recorded for the aqueous extract. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> (μg/mL) of peppermint oil by using DPPH scavenging method was found to be 15.2 ± 0.9 [
