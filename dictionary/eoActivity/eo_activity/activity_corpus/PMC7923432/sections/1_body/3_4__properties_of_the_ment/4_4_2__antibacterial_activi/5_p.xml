 <italic>Mentha</italic> component activity against multiple strains of bacteria mentioned above will have a pronounced impact in the future production of novel plant-derived drugs and in food storage/protection. However, the antimicrobial effect needs to be better elucidated considering that it might be due to the occurrence or cooccurrence of bioactives such as luteolin, rosmarinic acid, caffeic acid, gallocatechin, epigallocatechin gallate and catechins, menthone, isomenthone, and hexadecanoic acid in this species.
