<p id="par0115">Relative right kidney weight, AST and albumin values showed significant variations between treated and control groups. Groups treated with highest dose of the EO showed elevated level of AST value compared to control (mean difference of controls versus 400 mg/kg = -315.6, 95 % CI: −610.3 to −20.83). Significant difference in mean albumin level was observed among different treated groups. Albumin concentration in those treated with 200 mg/kg EO was significantly lower compared to all other treatment groups (
