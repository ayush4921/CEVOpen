<p id="par0145">Most clinical chemistry values did not show significant variations among different treatment groups, except albumin concentration and AST values. Elevated AST level was observed in high-dose treated group compared to control group. AST and ALT levels are widely used as sensitive markers to evaluate toxic manifestations of liver [
 <xref rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Increased serum ALT level could be attributed to hypertrophy and other disorders of the liver yet with possible extra hepatic sources [
 <xref rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], while an increased AST level could indicate hepatic cell damage. Elevated AST level in this study was observed without histological abnormalities. ALT is a cytoplasmic enzyme present in the liver, and it significantly increased during hepatocellular damage [
 <xref rid="bib0230" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], while AST is present extra-cellularly in various tissues including heart, skeletal muscles, liver, kidneys, pancreas, and erythrocytes [
 <xref rid="bib0235" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. AST is released from multiples of cells in response to cellular damage or change in membrane permeability. Hence, as ALT is a more sensitive biomarker of hepatic damage compared to AST, an elevated AST without change in ALT level could not necessarily indicate an insult in the liver.
