<p>In recent years, the prevalence of fungal infection has increased. These mycotic diseases account for over 10 lakhs of human deaths annually, which has become a delinquent health issue across the world. In today’s scenario, these opportunistic fungal infections have affected immunosuppressed or immunocompromised patients, and folks proclaimed for administration in the intensive care unit. These mycotic infections are classified from non-life-threatening mucocutaneous illnesses to intrusive infections which can affect any organ (

 <italic>Candida</italic> species, 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> is the one most commonly recorded and encountered fungal pathogen in the human race (

 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, is known to be the reason for death in nosocomial and opportunistically abysmal fungal infection in patients (

 <italic>Candida glabrata. Candida tropicalis</italic> is commonly found in urinary tract infections (UTI) whereas 
 <italic>Candida parapsilosis</italic> is mostly located on the epidermis of a healthy individual. The latter is also the causative agent of catheter-related infections. Likewise, all 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species depict differences in terms of their biofilm formation, structure, changes in the morphology extracellular matrix (ECM), and potential to resist antifungal drugs (
