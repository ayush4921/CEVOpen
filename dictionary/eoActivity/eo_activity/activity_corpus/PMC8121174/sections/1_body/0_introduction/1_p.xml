<p>Biofilms are structurally organized microbial communities attached to the surfaces of implanted devices encapsulated within a solid protective extracellular matrix (
 <xref rid="B156" ref-type="bibr">Spormann et al., 2004</xref>). Approximately, 65% of all human microbial infections embroil biofilm formation. Therefore, identifying its role, composition, and impact of microbial biofilms on human medication is an attractive proposition (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Douglas, 2003</xref>). Biofilm “inhabitants,” fungi and bacteria, are less sensitive or insensitive to antimicrobial agents. The property of the microorganisms to adhere to different surfaces facilitates the formation of biofilm in clinical settings such as catheters, prosthetic heart valves, joints, and various tissues in the host leading to effective colonization and this results in persistent drug-resistant.
