 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> colonizes the skin, intestinal mucosa and/or genital mucosa of 30–70% of healthy individuals. Therefore, under normal circumstances, the fungus does not cause any significant disease (
 <xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr">Ramage et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, about 15% of sepsis cases acquired in a hospital due to medical devices occur due to the predominant fungi 
 <italic>Candida</italic> (
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">Lohse et al., 2018</xref>). According to some recent reports, 63.5% of patients out of 224 patients suffering from septic shock showed a positive result for 
 <italic>Candida</italic> and were found dead. Thus, it is the leading cause of death in hospital procured diseases (
 <xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr">Ramage et al., 2014</xref>). In India, just 6-18% of cases of Candidemia are reported. A study exhibits 53 repeated episodes of Candidemia in 48 patients in 1.5 years. Different species made their contribution, like 45% of infections were due to 
 <italic>C. tropicalis</italic>, while 23% of cases by 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and the rest 32% by other 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp. (
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">Kothari and Sagar, 2009</xref>). Western countries’ trend on candidemia differs from India as 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> is related to more than 50% of all candidemia incidences (
