<p>The titanium oxide nanoparticles (Ti-NP) when scrutinized for their antifungal property showed strong antifungal activity against planktonic form of 
 <italic>C. albicans.</italic> They also depicted robust potential against biofilm formation (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Haghighi et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) used on 
 <italic>Candida</italic> biofilm showed a decrease in the biofilm formation by abot 62%-85% at varied concentration of 125 ppm to 250 ppm respectively. The ZnO-NPs suggested to inhibit hyphae formation in 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> by production of reactive oxygen species in a dose-dependent manner (

 <italic>C. albicans.</italic> The study revealed that copper oxide nanoparticles constrain the yeast for hypae transformation. Also CuO-NP elicited the reactive oxygen species while Cu
 <sub>2</sub>ONP pronounced the membrane damage in 
 <italic>C. albicans.</italic> In comparison to both types of copper oxide nanoparticles, CuONP was more stable and depicted better antifungal activity in comparison to Cu
 <sub>2</sub>O-NP (

 <sub>4</sub> NPs) were investigated on 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> biofilm which showed 87.2-100% inhibition based on their particle size which was 100 ppm to 200 pm respectively (
