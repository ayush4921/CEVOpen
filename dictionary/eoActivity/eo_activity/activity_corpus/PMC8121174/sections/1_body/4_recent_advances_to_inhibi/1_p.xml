<p>Throughout this article, we have seen different strategies and methods to combat antifungal drug resistance. However, after all the efforts and attempts we are still stuck at a point where biofilm formation is difficult to treat with both non-antifungal and antifungal drugs because of the poor penetration and non-specificity of the drugs. Therefore, to address this issue, researchers are working on finding ways to increase the penetration of drugs into the extracellular matrix of biofilm. Over the last few years, different metal nanoparticles have emerged as prospective candidates to treat microbial infections pertaining to their strong potential as antimicrobial agents. In this context, different research groups have initiated the exploration to identify the antibiofilm activity of different nanomaterials against
