<p>While going through 1,600 compounds present in the drug-repositioning library, 8 hits were obtained. These are Hexachlorophene 
 <bold>55</bold> (anti- topical anti-infective drug) (
 <xref rid="B150" ref-type="bibr">Siles et al., 2013</xref>), Pyrvinium pamoate 
 <bold>56</bold> (an anti-helminthic drug), Artesunate 
 <bold>57</bold> (antimalarial drug), Broxyquinoline 
 <bold>58</bold> (antiseptic drug), Dihydroartemisinin 
 <bold>59</bold> (antimalarial drug), Gentian violet 
 <bold>60</bold> (antibacterial and antihelminthic drug), Bithionate disodium 
 <bold>61</bold> (antiseptic), and Nitroxoline (Antibacterial). Out of these 8 hits, the first seven hits showed inhibition of mature 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> biofilm in combination with miconazole at sub-inhibitory concentrations. Further, studies were performed on the best-acknowledged potentiators, Hexachlorophene, pyrvinium pamoate, and artesunate. Mechanistic synergy was most pronounced for artesunate, an artemisinin homolog, which prompted the study of different structural homologs of Artemisinia. Thus, it was observed that biofilm inhibition in combination with Micanazole was not specific only to artesunate but also applicable to dihydroartemisinin and other artemisinin derivatives, indicating artemisinin as a potential antifungal molecule that can be further investigated to establish its overall potentials in the human health care system (
