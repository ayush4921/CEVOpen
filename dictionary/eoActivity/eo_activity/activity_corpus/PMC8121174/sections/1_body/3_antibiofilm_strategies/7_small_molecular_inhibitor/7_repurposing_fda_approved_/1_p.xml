 <bold>50</bold> and its derivative are some of the known antipsychotic drugs that were repurposed and were utilized as anti-biofilm molecules. Haloperidolâ€™s derivative exhibited inhibition of yeast to hyphal transition in resistant strain of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> in synergism with FLC while it also down-regulated the expression of ERG11, and MDR1 genes are leading to cell membrane damage. Moreover, compound 
 <bold>49a</bold> showed significant decrease in the CFU/g from 7.63 to 7.29 in murine model of invasive candidiasis. Similarly, Bromoperidol and its derivative showed a synergistic effect in combination with different azoles. The mechanism of action is unknown but it does decrease the amount of azole administered at the time of treatment (
