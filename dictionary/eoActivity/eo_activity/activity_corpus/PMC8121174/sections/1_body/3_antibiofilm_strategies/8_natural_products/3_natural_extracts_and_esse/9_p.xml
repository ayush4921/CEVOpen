<p>Myriocin 
 <bold>133</bold> is a metabolite of the 
 <italic>Isaria sinclairii - a pathogenic insect</italic> fungus. It disrupts the formation of sphingolipids as it is a structural analog of sphingosine precursors. It works very effectively in combination with known antifungal drugs like amphotericin and fluconazole, reducing the mortality rate from 26% to 0%, respectively. Additionally, 
 <italic>G.mellonella</italic> larva infected with 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> showed a decrease in mortality rate when treated with myriocin. Furthermore, study of compound 
 <bold>133</bold> indicated that it regulates 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> pathogenesis through NF-ÎºB pathway, G protein coupled receptor and immunity (
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">Melo et al., 2013</xref>). Acetylcholine 
 <bold>134,</bold> a known soluble protein that has a neuronal function, also displays strong anti-biofilm activity against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Along with this, it also reduces the damage induced due to inflammation in the host. Additionally, 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> study of acetylcholine on 
 <italic>G. mellonella</italic> larvae showed robust antifungal potency with a decrease in mortality rate from 80 to 100% to 25%. Further, compound 
 <bold>134</bold> acts by promoting the rapid cellular immune response in host cells (
