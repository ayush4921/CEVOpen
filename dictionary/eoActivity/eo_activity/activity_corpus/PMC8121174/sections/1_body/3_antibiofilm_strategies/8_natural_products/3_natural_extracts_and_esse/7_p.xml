<p>In 
 <italic>Thymus carnosus</italic> oil, high aggregates of Camphene and Borneol were present while 
 <italic>Thymus camphoratus</italic> oil 
 <italic>was rich in</italic> 1,8-cineole and Î±-pinene. Both the oils were highly effective against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> biofilm and germ tube formation with very little toxicity (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Alves et al., 2019</xref>). Another category of essential oils 
 <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic> and 
 <italic>Cymbopogon citratus</italic>, largely used in Asia, especially in India, for the treatment of inflammation and skin infection, displayed a potent anti-biofilm activity against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> strain (
 <xref rid="B143" ref-type="bibr">Sajjad et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, Safranal 
 <bold>122</bold> and its thiosemicarbazone 
 <bold>122a</bold> derivative, the bioactive compounds obtained from 
 <italic>Crocus sativa</italic> when added together in 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> culture, acted as a potent inhibitor of biofilm and germ tube formation at 32 times less concentration than MIC (
