<p>Phenotypic screening refers to the nascent methodology for the biological screening of the chemical entities to assess their therapeutic effects. It is not a target- based strategy but involves detailed cell-based studies (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Aulner et al., 2019</xref>). The phenotypic screening was done to identify different small molecules which depict antibiofilm and antifilamentation activity against 
 <italic>C. albicans.</italic> This study leads to the identification of about 2293 compounds from the chemical library of the National Cancer Institute which were categorized into three sets- (i) NCI Natural set, Out of all the compounds present in this set six hits were confirmed against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> biofilm formation. These include -Trichoderonin 
 <bold>27</bold>; Nanaomycin 
 <bold>28</bold>; Rapamycin 
 <bold>29</bold>; Anisomycin 
 <bold>30</bold>; Valinomycin 
 <bold>31</bold> and Bacitracin 
 <bold>32</bold>. Three of these molecules (Trichoderonin, Nanaomycin, Rapamycin) showed inhibition of both filamentation and biofilm formation while the rest three showed inhibition against biofilm formation.
