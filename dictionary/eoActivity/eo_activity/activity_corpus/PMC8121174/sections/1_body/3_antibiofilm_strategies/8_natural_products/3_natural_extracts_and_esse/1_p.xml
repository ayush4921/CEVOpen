<p>Ethanol extract of 
 <italic>Tovomita krukovii</italic> led to the identification of few new xanthones like 1,3,5-trihydroxy-8-isoprenylxanthone 
 <bold>85a</bold>, 1,5,7-trihydroxy-8-isoprenylxanthone 
 <bold>85b</bold>, betulinic acid 
 <bold>86,</bold> and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid 
 <bold>87</bold> targeting secreted aspartic protease SAP2 of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values 15 μg/ml, 25 μg/ml, 40 μg/ml, and 6.5 μg/ml, respectively (
 <xref rid="B190" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>). Crude hydro alcoholic extract prepared through peel extract of 
 <italic>Punica grantum</italic> presented strong inhibitory activity against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> at MIC 3.9 μg/mL and led to the two-fold decrease in the concentration of FLC when used in combination (

 <italic>Coriandrum sativum</italic> delineates fungicidal activity in a combination of amphotericin B, mainly targeting germ tube formation in 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> (
 <xref rid="B151" ref-type="bibr">Silva et al., 2011</xref>). According to the studies, 
 <italic>Rumex</italic> root extract and Nepodin 
 <bold>88,</bold> a compound extracted from 
 <italic>Rumex</italic> roots, were defined as anti-biofilm agents against 
 <italic>C. albicans.</italic> It also increased the survivability in nematode infection model. Further, Nepodin also showed repressed expression of several genes related to bud to hyphal transition Like 
 <italic>ECE1</italic>, 
 <italic>UME6, HWP1</italic>, and 
 <italic>HGT10</italic>, while the increase in the expression of quite a few transport genes (
 <italic>CDR4</italic>, 
 <italic>TPO2</italic>, and 
 <italic>CDR11</italic>) essential for phenotypic expression (

 <italic>Waltheria indica</italic>, 10 quinoline alkaloids were identified as a potential molecule which inhibit biofilm formation in 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>: These include Waltherione N 
 <bold>89</bold>, (R)-Vanessine 
 <bold>90</bold>, Waltherione Q 
 <bold>91</bold>, 8-deoxoantidesmone
