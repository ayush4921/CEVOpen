<p>Secreted Aspartic Protease-2 enzymes (SAP2) of the 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> are one of the known classes of the virulent factor for localized and systemic infection. In 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, ten distinct SAP genes (SAP1-10) were expressed 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. The SAPs are essential for the fungal nutrition process and contribute to the fungal pathogenicity due to their critical participation in several stages of the infective process, including adhesion, invasion, and tissue damage and so on. Pepstatin and peptidomimetic are the known peptide inhibitors, but it is challenging to clinically synthesize them due to pharmacokinetic characteristics. So from the studies, compound 
 <bold>16,</bold> one of the derivatives of pepstatin, came out to be a potent inhibitor against 3 of the SAP2 present in fungi. Moreover, compound 
 <bold>16</bold> and fluconazole when administered to FLC resistant mouse model infected with 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> showed synergistic effect by increasing the survival rate of the mouse by 50% (
