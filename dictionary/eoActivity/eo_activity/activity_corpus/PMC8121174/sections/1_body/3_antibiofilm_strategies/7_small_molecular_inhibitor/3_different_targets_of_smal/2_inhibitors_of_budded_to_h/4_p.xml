<p>Another compound N-[3-(allyloxy)-phenyl]-4-methoxyben zamide

 <italic>albicans</italic> filamentation and was found effective in both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> study of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> infected murine model. The whole transcriptomic analysis revealed a total of 618 genes that were up-regulated and 702 were down-regulated. It was observed that most of the down-regulated genes such as SAP5, ECE1, and ALS3 already well-characterized were associated with filamentation and virulency. In addition, some genes affect metal chelation and utilization (
