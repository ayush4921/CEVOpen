<p>As already mentioned, quorum sensing plays an important role in mediating the formation of biofilm of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>. One of the known quorum-sensing molecules released from 
 <italic>Candida</italic> itself, “Farnesol” 
 <bold>20,</bold> is known to inhibit filamentation in 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, which is a known virulence factor enhancing biofilm formation. From the previous studies it is known that the upregulation of the sterol biosynthetic pathway gene 
 <italic>ERG</italic> and the efflux pump genes 
 <italic>CDR</italic> and 
 <italic>MDR</italic> are one of the major contributors to the azole tolerance in 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Therefore, through northern blot studies, it was examined that Farnesol down-regulates the expression of partial gene expression in ergosterol biosynthesis, Ras1-cAMP-Efg1 signaling cascade, 
 <italic>HWP1</italic> promoter, which encodes for hyphal –specific cell wall protein (

 <xref rid="B187" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Dižová and Bujdáková, 2017</xref>). Further, it was observed that compound 
 <bold>20</bold> is in synergism with already known antifungal drugs augmenting the accumulation of ROS, leading to early apoptosis in fungal cells (

 <bold>21</bold> has been identified as an effective small molecular inhibitor which significantly decreases biofilm formation by 
 <italic>C. albicans.</italic> Additionally, it shows, anti-filamentation, as well as anti-adhesion activity at four to eight fold decreased MIC concentrations. Nevertheless, it down-regulates 
 <italic>HWP1, ALS3, EAP1</italic>, 
 <italic>HST7</italic> and 
 <italic>CPH</italic> transcription factors that play a key role in biofilm formation (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Feldman et al., 2014</xref>). Another newly discovered Thiazolidinedione molecule- N-(oxazolylmethyl)-thiazolidinedione 
 <bold>22</bold> scaffolds has been identified as a novel compound that inhibits 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> Als surface protein (
