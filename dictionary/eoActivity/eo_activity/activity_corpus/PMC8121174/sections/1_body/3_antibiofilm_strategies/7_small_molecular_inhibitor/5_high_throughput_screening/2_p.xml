<p>Ebselen 
 <bold>24</bold> an organoselenium compound, was screened out from the off-patent drugs using the Prestwick Chemical Library, a repurposing library of about 1,280 small molecules. Out of nine molecules, Ebselen illustrated 100% inhibition against multi-drug resistant species, 
 <italic>Candida auris</italic> at concentration ≤ 2.5 μM (
 <xref rid="B174" ref-type="bibr">Wall et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, it elucidates its antifungal activity by accumulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) inside the fungal cells. Further, 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> study of 
 <italic>C. elegan</italic> model infected with 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> showed complete eradication of fungal load when treated with 8 μg/ml of ebselen (

 <bold>25</bold> (AXD) and Thimerosal 
 <bold>26</bold> showed more than 80% of inhibition mature biofilms. Subsequently, AXD showed antibiofilm potency
