<p>The α-Longipinene 
 <bold>118,</bold> a significant component of 
 <italic>Helichrysum</italic> oil and 
 <italic>Cascarilla</italic> bark oil, inhibited the 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>albicans</italic> biofilm formation without affecting planktonic cell growth and also exhibited a decrease in the virulence in 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> model (
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">Manoharan et al., 2017a</xref>). Further, the compounds Glabridin 
 <bold>119</bold>, Licochalcone A 
 <bold>120</bold>, and Glycyrrhizic acid 
 <bold>121</bold> derived from Licorice- a natural compound extracted from the root of the plant 
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic> showed biofilm inhibition against 
 <italic>C. albicans.</italic> It was found that Glabridin, Licochalcone A showed 35-60% of biofilm inhibition while they inhabited more than 80% hyphal growth. Furthermore, they displayed a synergistic effect with Nystatin at sub-inhibitory concentration (

 <italic>T. camphoratus</italic> and 
 <italic>T. carnosus</italic>, earlier used in Portuguese as an antimicrobial therapy, lead to the discovery of different molecules.
