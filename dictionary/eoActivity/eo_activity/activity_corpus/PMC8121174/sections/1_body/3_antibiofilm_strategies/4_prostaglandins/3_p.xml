<p>Arachidonic acid, when used along with antifungal drugs, affects the level of prostaglandin E2 in a variety of 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp. The above-mentioned study suggests that lipid plays a specific role in the structural aspects, signaling cascade, fungal pathogenicity, and metabolic activity of biofilm development in 
 <italic>C. albicans.</italic> However, the defined part of lipid-dependent processes in the development of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> biofilm is still not known. Genetic modulation and pharmacological inflection of biosynthetic pathways of lipids are the two stratagems that have been browbeaten in linking lipid alterations with 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> biofilm morphology- its formation and function in this fungi. Modulating the lipid composition of the cell membrane by comprehensively targeting genes that encode enzymes for lipid biosynthesis regulates endogenic lipid levels (
