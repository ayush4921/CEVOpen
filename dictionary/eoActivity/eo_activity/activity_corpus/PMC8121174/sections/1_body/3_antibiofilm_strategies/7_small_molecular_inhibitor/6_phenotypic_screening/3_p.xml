<p>Next and last was (iii)-NCI-Challenge Set. In this, there were total 11 hits, of which 10 showed inhibition against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> biofilm formation whereas only one compound inhibited filamentation transformation. Ten hits which were identified from these compounds displayed common inhibition against both biofilm and filament formation. These include Biofilm Inhibitor- Trichopolyn-B
