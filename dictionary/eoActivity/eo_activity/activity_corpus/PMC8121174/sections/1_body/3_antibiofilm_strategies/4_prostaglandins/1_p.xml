<p>Molecular studies on biofilms have revealed the important role of lipids on antifungal resistance. The lipid profile of planktonic cells differs from that of biofilms, making lipids a censorious modulator of resistance. This change in the sphingolipids and sterol profile promotes biofilm formation affects cells morphology and physiology altering the adhesion properties in

The signaling cascade of Arachidonic acid (AA) is pivotal for both biology of humans and fungi morphology and growth. Very nearly each of the following enzymes of the AA cascade can be subjected to the pharmacological investigation: Cyclooxygenase (COX), Cytochrome P 450 (CYP), and Lipoxygenase (LOX) (
