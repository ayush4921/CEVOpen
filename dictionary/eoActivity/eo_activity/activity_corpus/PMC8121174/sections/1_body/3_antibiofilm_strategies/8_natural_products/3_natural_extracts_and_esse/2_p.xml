<p>The Unexplored Brazilian Organic Propolis –BOP6 crude extract was characterized as an anti-inflammatory and anti-biofilm agent. It reduces the mortality rate by 30% in 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> infected sample with MIC ranging from 50 to 100 μg/mL while in combination with Amphotericin B, it decreases to 0.25 to 1.0 μg/mL (

 <italic>Bionectria ochroleuca</italic>, an endophytic fungus. when cultivated on cereals, lead to the production of certain secondary metabolites-Polyketide glycosides
