<p>Antibiotic lock therapy is, in general, a combination of an antibacterial solution that has minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) 100-1000 times greater than the antibiotic used for planktonic cells in combination with the anticoagulant instilled into the lumen of a catheter. The solution is allowed to dwell or is “locked” while the Central Venous Catheter (CVC) is not used to prevent colonization or sterilize a previously infected catheter (
