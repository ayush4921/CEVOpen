<p>Filastatin 
 <bold>1,</bold> inhibits yeast to hyphal transition, impedes the adhesion of fungal cells to different biomaterials by inhibiting the hyphal specific 
 <italic>HWP1</italic> promoter. Interestingly, in the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies, filastatin in the presence of fluconazole protected 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection. Moreover, it also inhibited biofilm formation in a mouse model of vulvovaginal candidal infection (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Fazly et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, Johnson and the group identified several small molecular inhibitors. This includes Buhytrin A 
 <bold>2</bold>, CGP-37157 
 <bold>3</bold> (affecting the calcium metabolism of bud to hyphal transition), and ETYA 
 <bold>4</bold> (inhibiting multiple signaling pathways) and Clozapine 
 <bold>5</bold> (FDA approved antipsychotic drug inhibiting Efg1 pathway at Gpr1 G-protein-coupled receptor level). These molecules restrict the bud to hyphal growth in 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and affect multiple signaling pathways that are intricate in the filamentation process which regulates the biofilm formation (

 <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr">Pierce et al., 2015b</xref>). By screening a library of 50,240 small molecules of inhibitors for yeast-to-hypha transition, Sm21 
 <bold>6</bold> was identified as a novel small antifungal molecule that showed its efficacy in both 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> oral candidiasis mouse model and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> system. The study also revealed that compound 
 <bold>6</bold> when given to 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> strain led to reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and mitochondrial dysfunction (
 <xref rid="B180" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B169" ref-type="bibr">Truong et al., 2018</xref>). In another study, Chrysazin 
 <bold>7</bold> (1, 8-dihydroxyanthraquinone) and Alizarin 
 <bold>8</bold> (1, 2-dihydroxyanthraquinone) an anthraquinone derivative, effectively inhibits biofilm formation in 
 <italic>C. albicans.</italic> Their anti-biofilm activity was mainly due to a hydroxyl group (-OH) at C1 position. Unlike other commercially available drugs, alizarin was found to be a non-toxic compound. It downregulates the expression of various hyphal-specific and biofilm related genes like 
 <italic>ALS3, ECE1, ECE2</italic>, and 
 <italic>RBT1</italic>. Additionally, Chrysazin and Alizarin at 2 Î¼g/ml adequately inhibited yeast to hyphal formation and increased the survivability of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> infected 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic>, thus, proving to be a strong candidate for future investigation as an antifungal agent (
