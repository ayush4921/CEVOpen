<p>Homology studies using 
 <italic>Candida</italic> Genome Database showed that 
 <italic>Candida</italic> accounts for type III 5-α-reductase, Dfg10p, and shares a 27% sequence identity and 41% similarity to the human type III 5-α-reductase, which were identified as a target for benign prostatic hyperplasia. Finasteride 
 <bold>13</bold> was recognized as one of the potent inhibitors against type III 5-α-reductase. Studying its activity showed some promising results at dose ≥16 mg/liter. Finasteride alone was highly efficient in preventing filamentation of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and demonstrated synergy with FLC against 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> urinary biofilm (
