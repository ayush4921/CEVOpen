<p>The crude extract of eucalyptus oil and its component 1, 8- cineole 
 <bold>106</bold> showed antimicrobial activity against different microbes including 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> biofilm. It showed inhibitory effect alone and also in combination with chlorhexidine (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Hendry et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B153" ref-type="bibr">Simsek and Duman, 2017</xref>). While studying different components of essential oils as a treatment against invasive candidiasis, some terpenic derivatives showed promising results. These include carvacrol 
 <bold>73</bold>, geraniol 
 <bold>75</bold>, carvone 
 <bold>78</bold>, terpinen-4-ol
 <bold>107</bold>, linalool 
 <bold>108</bold>, menthol 
 <bold>109</bold>, α-terpineol 
 <bold>110</bold>, nerol 
 <bold>111</bold>, isopulegol 
 <bold>112</bold>, menthone 
 <bold>113,</bold> and α-thujone 
 <bold>114.</bold> On further study, tyrosol 
 <bold>115</bold> –(a phenethyl alcohol), tyrosine derivative and eugenol- phenylpropanoid 
 <bold>116</bold> both showed a strong inhibitory effect against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> biofilm (

 <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr">Raut et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, tyrosol 
 <bold>115</bold> showed antibiofilm activity when applied exogenously at millimolar concentration. However, at micromolar concentration this compound stimulates hyphal production during the intial stage of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> biofilm formation. This inhibition of biofilm formation by the exogenous addition of quorum sensing molecule usually occurs due to disruption in the qurom sensing mechanisms or due to the limitation of yeast adhesion on medical devices (
