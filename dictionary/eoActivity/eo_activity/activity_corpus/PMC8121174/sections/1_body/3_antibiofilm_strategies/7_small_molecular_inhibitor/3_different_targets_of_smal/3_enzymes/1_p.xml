<p>Potent inhibitors of essential microbial enzymes are significant growth inhibitors of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, a pathogenic fungi. The enzyme aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (ASADH) is critical for the functioning of the biosynthetic pathway of aspartate in microbes and plants, an important step for the biosynthesis of other essential amino acids. Because the aspartate pathway is absent in humans, ASADH can be a promising new target for antifungal research. Deleting the ASD gene encoding for ASADH significantly decreases the survival of
