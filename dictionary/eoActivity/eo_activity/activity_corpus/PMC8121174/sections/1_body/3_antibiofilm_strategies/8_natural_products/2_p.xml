<p>Occasionally, other known naturally occurring compounds are found to be useful. The Carvone 
 <bold>78</bold> and perillaledhyde 
 <bold>79</bold> (
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">McGeady et al., 2002</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B167" ref-type="bibr">Tian et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">Moro et al., 2018</xref>) at very low concentration inhibit the filamentous formation of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Furthermore, it was observed that at MIC of 4 μl/mL compound 
 <bold>77</bold> increased the level of ROS, which activated the programmed cell death in 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Additionally, it equalizes the level of E-cadherins the epithelial barriers preventing which decreases in number due to invasion of pathogenic fungi (
 <xref rid="B167" ref-type="bibr">Tian et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B130" ref-type="bibr">Qu et al., 2019</xref>). The Riccardin D
 <bold>80, 80a</bold> - macrocyclic bisbibenzyl isolated from 
 <italic>Dumortiera hirsute</italic> chinese liverwort, exhibited an inhibitory effect on the biofilm formation of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> by downregulating HWP1, ASL3, and EFG1 genes thus, inhibiting hyphal formation. Additionally, one of the semi-synthetic derivative of Riccardin D with a bromine atom attached to the arene ring showed better antifungal activity with MIC-2 μg/ml in comparison to Riccardin with MIC-16 μg/ml (
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B159" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2016</xref>). Another known compound is Emodin 
 <bold>81</bold> (1, 3, 8−trihydroxy−6−methyl−anthraquinone) which is a natural secondary plant product, originally isolated from the rhizomes of 
 <italic>Rheum palmatum</italic>. This compound suppressed the growth of the cells of reference and clinical 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> strains with minimal inhibitory and minimal fungicidal concentration values between 12.5 and 200 μg/mL, respectively, showing anti-virulent potential. Research showed that emodin added to 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> culture inhibited the phosphorylation of many cellular proteins, presumably, owing to the inhibition of protein kinase CK2. Notably, the enzyme isolated from the 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells was found to be susceptible to emodin with IC50 of 2.8 μg/mL, revealing that emodin was able to occupy the ATP−binding pocket of CK2 (
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Janeczko et al., 2017</xref>). In another finding, 
 <italic>M. sylvestris</italic> root was also shown to inhibit 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> biofilm formation (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Alizadeh et al., 2017</xref>). Studies on quorum sensing inhibition and the quest for QS inhibitors have shown plants to produce anti-QS substances. Several anti-QS methods have been used, including natural products from plant-based secondary metabolites (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Berde et al., 2019</xref>). Carbohydrate derived fulvic acid (CHD-FA) 
 <bold>82</bold> from pure form of fulvic acid is obtained from humic substances, also exhibits anti-biofilm activity against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> (
 <xref rid="B148" ref-type="bibr">Sherry et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Borghi et al., 2015</xref>). Plant alkaloid berberine 
 <bold>83</bold> showed 91% biofilm inhibition against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> in combination with Miconazole. Furthermore, it reduces the metabolic activity of early- stage biofilm formation in 
 <italic>C. albicans.</italic> Individually, Berberine inactivates fungal biofilm at MIC range 0.98-31.25mg/mL (
 <xref rid="B177" ref-type="bibr">Wei et al., 2011</xref>). Resveratrol (3, 4, 5 -trihydroxystilbene) 
 <bold>84</bold> is a phytoalexin, a known antimicrobial agent present in a wide range of dietary sources, including peanuts, plums, grapes and in red wines. A semisynthetic compound -EB487 
 <bold>84a</bold> was synthesized from resveratrol, which showed an antibiofilm and anti-preformed biofilm activity against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> strain. Subsequently, the study revealed that resveratrol regulates its antifungal activity from early to late apoptosis stage. Furthermore, it increases the ROS concentration in fungal cells of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and modulates the activation of metacaspase release in response to mitochondrial dysfunction (
