<p>While looking for different antibiofilm drug groups, scientists looked for the Hsp 90 and Calcineruin inhibitors as it chemo sensitizes the fungal strains toward azole- as the first line of antifungal drugs. Piperazinyl quinolone 
 <bold>51</bold> screened from MLPCN library had no antifungal activity alone, but, in combination with Azoles, it selectively inversed the fluconazole resistance in the clinical isolates of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> (

 <bold>52</bold> and Cyclosporine A 
 <bold>53</bold>, the other potential calcineruin inhibitors also illustrated the increase in the susceptibility of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> toward antifungal drugs (

 <bold>54,</bold> already known antiviral drug, was screened through Prestwick Chemical Library against FLC-resistant strains. It illustrated a fungistatic effect against MDR species of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and acted synergistically with MIC &lt; 24.4 Î¼g/mL (
