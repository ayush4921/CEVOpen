<p>Arising fungal resistance ascribed to mutational changes has diversified the complexity fueling the thought processes along this line. To overcome this issue, we need to find some substantial solutions. For the past few decades, natural products have emerged as an essential source of antibacterial, antimalarial, and chemotherapeutic agents. Presently, around 60% of used drugs for cancer treatment are procured from natural products. Furthermore, the modification of natural products is one of the most common and productive methodologies to obtain novel therapeutic agents using medicinal chemistry (
 <xref rid="B189" ref-type="bibr">Zaki et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, targeting fungal biofilms by either natural derivatives or synthetic analogs could be a novel approach. Natural product screening has proved to be one of the promising strategies. Although anti-biofilm agents themselves might not kill the bacteria, they can make them more susceptible to conventional antibiotics and the action of the host immune system. The search for biofilm inhibitors has led to identifying a significant number of compounds of potential therapeutic use as biofilm inhibitors. A literature survey reveals that some of the most active anti-biofilm compounds discovered to date have been based upon the molecular scaffolds of natural products isolated from marine natural products and plant products (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Fazly et al., 2013</xref>). As compiled by the World Health Organization, more than 21,000 plant species containing a vast array of biologically active compounds have been used worldwide in herbal medicines (
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">Midkiff et al., 2011</xref>). Naturally occurring alcohols magnolol 
 <bold>71</bold> and its isomer honokiol 
 <bold>72</bold>, carvacrol 
 <bold>73</bold>, thymol 
 <bold>74,</bold> and geraniol 
 <bold>75</bold> have been identified as a potent inhibitor of both bacterial and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> biofilms (

 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">Magi et al., 2015</xref>;

 <xref rid="B147" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Behbehani et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, when 
 <italic>C. elegan</italic> was treated with 16 μg/ml of magnolol and honokiol, there was a decrease in the number of colony forming units (CFU) of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> in the nematode which enhances its survival. Additionally, antibiofilm activity of these compounds 
 <bold>69</bold> and 
 <bold>70</bold> were related to Ras1-cAMP-Efg1 pathway of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> (
 <xref rid="B160" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2015</xref>). A Recent study shows that compound 
 <bold>70</bold> and 
 <bold>71</bold> are antifungal and induce ROS mediated programmed cell death in 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> (
 <xref rid="B161" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">Niu et al., 2020</xref>). Saponins are one of the known natural products that bind to the ergosterol rather than cholesterol of 
 <italic>C. albicans.</italic> This increases the susceptibility to photodynamic inactivation due to an increase in the permeability of photosensitizers by sapnonin. In one study, a total of 12 different saponins were identified as potential antifungal agents, but out of those 12, only two were selected. One was 
 <bold>76,</bold> which belongs to the aginoside family of saponins and the secone one 
 <bold>77</bold> to the barrgeniol family of the saponins. Both of these compounds were potent antifungal agents with MIC 16 and 32 μg/ml, respectively. Furthermore, to study toxicity and efficacy of the compound, 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> models were used. In an 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> study, compound 
 <bold>76</bold> and 
 <bold>77</bold> showed no sign of toxicity and conferred high percentage of nematode survival from upto 73% to 80%, respectively (
