<p>Microbiological resistance depends on various fungal factors that have been established due to genetic alteration in the fungi. Clinical resistance is due to host- or drug-related factors. All these factors may cause fungal resistance individually or in tandem. In addition to standardized susceptibility testing and appropriate drug dosing, one way to avoid resistance is the use of combinational antifungal therapy. Combination therapy also offers advantages in increased synergistic action with enhanced spectrum activity. Newer insights into mechanisms of drug resistance will help in the development of appropriate antifungal therapy.</p>
