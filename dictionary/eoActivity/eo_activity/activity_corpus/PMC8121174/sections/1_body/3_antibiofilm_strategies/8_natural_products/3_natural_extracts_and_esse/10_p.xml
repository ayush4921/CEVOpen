<p>Garcinol 
 <bold>135</bold> and Xanthochymol 
 <bold>136</bold>, isoprenylated benzophenones obtained from 
 <italic>Garcinia xanthochymus</italic> fruits, show antibiofilm activity against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> by inducing programmed cell death in early biofilms without actually affecting the growth and viability of planktonic cells. Sampangine B 
 <bold>137, 137(a-b)</bold> a naturally derived azaoxoporphine alkaloid and its derivatives showed potent activity against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> biofilms and yeast to hyphal formation. It was found to show antifungal activity by inducing the accumulation of ROS and subsequent heme dysfunction. Moreover, it showed strong 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> antifungal activity with low cytotoxicity in nematode model of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> (
