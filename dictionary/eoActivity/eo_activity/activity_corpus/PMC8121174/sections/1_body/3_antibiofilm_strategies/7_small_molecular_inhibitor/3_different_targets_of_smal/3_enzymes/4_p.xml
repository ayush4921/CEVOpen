<p>Targeting proteinases and phospholipases, which are vital to fungal invasion of host tissues and immunosuppression, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Aneja et al. (2016)</xref> developed an s triazole seriesâ€“amino acid hybrids. It was found that compounds 
 <bold>17</bold> and 
 <bold>18</bold> significantly reduce the secretion of proteinases and phospholipases in 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp. which are vital to fungal invasion of host tissues and immunosuppression. The study showed that on treatment with compound 
 <bold>17</bold>, proteinase secretion was decreased by 29, 22 and 23.5% in standard, FLC-sensitive and resistant strains of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, respectively, while at the same concentration, compound 18 decreased the proteinase secretion by 30, 33 and 17% against the respective strains. At similar concentrations in the same strains, compound 
 <bold>17</bold> caused 40, 38, and 38% inhibition in phopholipase secretion whereas compound 
 <bold>18</bold> decreased the secretions by 36, 27 and 38% respectively.
