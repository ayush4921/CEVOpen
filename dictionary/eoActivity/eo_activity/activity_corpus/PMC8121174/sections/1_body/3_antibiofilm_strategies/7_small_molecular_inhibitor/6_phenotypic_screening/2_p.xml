<p>Furthermore in the next (ii)-NCI-Structural diversity set, in total, there were 12 hits out of which eight were identified as biofilm inhibitor. These compounds were-Phenanthroline Hydrochloride 
 <bold>33</bold>; 2-isoquinolin-2-ium-2-yl-1-phenanthren-3- ylethanone, iodide 
 <bold>34</bold>;Metanilamide (3-aminobenzenesul fonamide) 
 <bold>35</bold>; Mercury, (4-amino phenyl)(6-thioguano sinato- N7,S6)- 
 <bold>36</bold>; 2-[7-[3-(carboxymethyl)-5,10-dihydroxy-1-methyl- 6,9-dioxo-3,4-dihydro-1H-benzo[g] isochromen-7-yl]-5,10-dihy droxy-1-methyl-6,9-dioxo-3,4-dihydro-1H-benzo [g]isochro men-3-yl]acetic acid 
 <bold>37</bold> are only biofilm inhibitors while Mercury,(2-aminio-1,9-dihydro-6H-purine-6-thionato-N7,S6) hexyl-,2-benzo[a]phenothiazin-12-yl-N,N-diethylethanamine 
 <bold>38</bold>; 17-[1-[2(dimethylamino)ethylamino]ethyl]-13-methyl-6,7,8, 9,11,12,14,15,16,17 decahydrocyclopenta[a]phenanthren-3-ol 
 <bold>39</bold>. Three of these compounds inhibited both filamentation and biofilm formation. From all these compounds related to 17- aminoestradiols, a Mercury containing organometallic was the most potent compound with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value in the range of nanomolar concentration.
