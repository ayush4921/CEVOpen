<p>While performing high throughput screening in a chemical library (NOVACore
 <sup>TM</sup>), about 20,000 small molecules were identified as a novel series of a Diazaspiro-decane and its structural analogs (9a-d). These molecules inhibit progressions of the virulence-associated with 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, especially biofilm formation and filamentation, without affecting the overall growth or prompting the resistance in 
 <italic>C. albicans.</italic> These compounds displayed a potent inhibitory activity when tested against murine models of oral candidiasis (

 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, it led to the discovery of two halogenated compounds (N1-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)-5-chloro-2-hydroxybenzamide) 10 and Niclosamide 11 which is the analog of salicylanilide, an FDA-approved anthelmintic in humans, both exhibiting an anti-filamentation and anti-biofilm activities against
