<p>Considering the efforts undertaken to find solutions to the fungal biofilm infections, the reader may acknowledge the complicated mechanisms that impede the path to reach the panacea. The research was done while managing the patients so far has led to the conclusion that the study of biofilm phenotype is inevitable to restrict fungal biofilms. Besides, the counter effect of fungus on the drug should be examined not just against the planktonic cells but also against the biofilm. Since fully established mature biofilms are much more challenging to treat and eradicate, preemptive practices targeting planktonic cells further inhibiting the early development of biofilms are the need of the hour. Nonetheless, strategies to combat mature biofilms should also be kept in mind. We discuss specific strategies that are under scrutiny, globally, against the problem of drug resistance (
