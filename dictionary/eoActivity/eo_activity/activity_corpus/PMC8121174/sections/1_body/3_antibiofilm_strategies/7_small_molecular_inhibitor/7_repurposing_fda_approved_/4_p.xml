<p>In another study, the library comprehending 1600 off-patent drugs was sifted for the compound that enhances 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> activity of amphotericin B when used in combination against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> biofilms. Out of 1600 compounds, the team found 50 hits, and from these 50 hits, only seven of them illustrated BIC
 <sub>50</sub> &lt; 100 μM for biofilm inhibition. Those compounds are as follow: Prochlorperazine edisylate 5.2 μM 
 <bold>(62)</bold>, Danthron 12 μM 
 <bold>(63)</bold>, Chlorprothixene hydrochloride 17 μM 
 <bold>(64),</bold> Toremifene citrate 19.5 μM 
 <bold>(65)</bold>, Clorgiline hydrochloride 24 μM 
 <bold>(66)</bold>; Perhexiline maleate 39 μM 
 <bold>(67)</bold> Dicyclomine hydrochloride 60 μM
 <bold>(68)</bold>. Subsequently, all of these compounds showed a synergistic effect with caspofungin. Additionally, while studying tormifene citrate 
 <bold>(65)</bold> for its synergistic effect on 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> infection model, it showed strong antifungal potency (

 <bold>69</bold> a non -steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, increased the susceptibility of caspofungin toward the 
 <italic>in vitro C. albicans</italic> biofilm. Furthermore, catheter retrieved from the animal model-rat when treated with combination therapy of caspofungin and diclofenac showed a significant reduction in the number of biofilm cells (

 <bold>70</bold> was identified as a potent inhibitor of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> which inhibited the early formation of pseudohyphal cells and mimicked standard azoles at higher concentrations showing different mechanisms of action (
