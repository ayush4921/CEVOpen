<p>For dealing with this problem of resistance, there are two ways: (i) finding of the novel anti-biofilm molecules and (ii) repurposing of the known drug to increase the activity of antifungal agents by combinational therapy. Due to the scarcity of known molecular scaffolds that inhibit/disperse fungal biofilms, high throughput screening (HTS) has been employed in an attempt to discover leads for new anti-biofilm modulators. Intending to identify novel small molecules that possessed anti-biofilm activity, screening of an extensive chemical library of compounds took a new start. It was observed that clinical isolates of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> have varied abilities to respond to different growth media to form hyphae and also biofilms, and this variability is not associated with specific host conditions or characteristics. A high-content screen has identified many new structural series of antifungal compounds with the mode of action, namely inhibition of biofilm formation and filamentation. Many compounds among them represent a promising candidate for the development of novel anti-virulence approaches against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> infections, aimed at minimizing the development of resistance.
