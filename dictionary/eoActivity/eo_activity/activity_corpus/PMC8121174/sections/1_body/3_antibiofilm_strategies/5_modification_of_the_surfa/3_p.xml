<p>These biomedical-assisted devices with a wide range of biomaterials are utilized by a wide range of pathogenic fungi like 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> to support adhesion, colonization, and subsequent biofilm formation (

 <xref rid="B163" ref-type="bibr">Talsma, 2007</xref>). Thus, to preclude these contagious microorganisms on the surface of implanted devices with biofilms, there is an inquisitiveness in the development and improvement of unconventional biomaterials which are unfavorable to microbial (both fungal and bacterial) adhesion and colonization. Another modification strategy from some studies suggests that modifying the surface chemistry of the biomaterials could be an approach to prevent or reduce biofilm formation. This could be achieved by adding surface-modifying end groups (SMEs) or by altering the chemical composition of substrates. For example, SME Polyetherurethane when added to Elasthane 80A, a biomaterial, decreased the 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> ability to form biofilm significantly (
