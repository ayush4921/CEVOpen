<p>Extracellular DNA (e-DNA) present inside the extracellular matrix is a major contributor to the stability of the 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> biofilm. The e-DNA is present both in bacterial and fungal biofilms; hence, when these biofilm-forming microorganisms are treated with DNAase enzyme in combination with the respective drugs, they exhibit a decrease in the biofilm matrix (
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">Martins et al., 2014</xref>). Various genetic factors like Bcr1 (a transcription factor required for the attachment of fungal cells to the abiotic surfaces), Rlmp, Brg1, Efg1, Ndt80, Rob1, and Tec1, Fsk1p, Smi1p (which works in unification with Fsk1p and Rlmp), Gcr1, Mnn4 are under study. All these factors work together and interact with different genes to regulate and generate biofilms, thus, has given new insight to biofilm formation (
