<p>On the other hand, there are many strategies employed by 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> to evade the immune response. Mature biofilms escape immune responses owing to the presence of a top layer of biofilm composed of hyphal cells which mask the Î²-glucans component of biofilm. Subsequently, these hyphal cells escape the neutrophil killing either by penetrating the epithelial cell layers in the course of invasive growth or by escaping immune response by physical penetrating inside the cell. The variance in the degree of expression of genes in planktonic cells concerning biofilms cells has a connection with a mechanism of immune evasion. There are several proteins that are highly expressed and they also restrict the stimulation of the host complement system. For example, Zinc binding cell surface protein Pra1, a cell surface glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase protein (Gpd2), and all the secretory proteins of aspartyl protease (Sap) family. Another well-known protein that functions as a sensor for cell wall damage with high expression in biofilms is Msb2. This protein secretes and blocks the antimicrobial peptides preventing complement activation.
