<p>Humans provide an immediate small- scale environment to a varied population of microbial species. The human microbiota embraces members from three kingdoms of life: Archaea, Bacteria, and fungi. They usually exist in a symbiotic relationship leading to a complex association of ecosystems. Imbalance in this symbiotic association due to genetic or environmental factors of the host - like changes in pH, shifts in host immunity, and transient viscosity of mucosal layers, and indiscriminate usage of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents- lead to the disproportionate infection by the overgrowth of specific microbial species over others.</p>
