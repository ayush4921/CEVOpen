<p>Another mechanism related to extracellular properties of the matrix of the 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> is quorum sensing, which plays a significant role in the growth of biofilms. It is a density-dependent cell-cell communication mechanism in which autoinducers (signal molecules) are released in response to the increasing density, which enhances or represses the activation of certain genes or factors. This density-dependent mechanism affects different aspects of microorganisms like pathogenesis, morphology, competence, etc. Importantly, it also makes its contribution to biofilm formation. Earlier, QS was thought to be an exclusive feature of a certain bacterial system, but the recent discovery of farnesol, a quorum-sensing molecule inhibiting 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> biofilms, has publicized QS (

Genetic regulation of virulent genes in pathogenic microorganisms by QS has shown an indirect connection with the emergence of multi-drug resistant pathogens. Thus, it necessitates the finding of alternative strategies to target QS and restrain the same (
