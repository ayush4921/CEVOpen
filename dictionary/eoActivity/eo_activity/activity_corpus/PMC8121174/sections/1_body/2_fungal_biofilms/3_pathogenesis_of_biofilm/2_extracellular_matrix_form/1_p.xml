<p>The extracellular matrix is a critically important feature of biofilms that guards the adherent cells against the host immune system and antifungal agents by forming an extensive structure of the matrix (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Borghi et al., 2016</xref>). In some of the pioneer works, it was shown that 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species biofilm’s matrices increase when highly dynamic flow environments influence biofilm, and its quantity extensively depends upon strain and the species. Moreover, the chemical composition of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> ECM suggests that the extracellular matrix is composed of approximately 55% of a combination of glycoproteins with carbohydrates contributing to only 25% of the total composition. Carbohydrates consist largely of α-mannan and β-1, 6-glucan polysaccharides with β-1, 3-glucans making a very little contribution. ECM also consists of 15% of lipids and only 5% of nucleic acids. β- 1, 3- glucan plays a major role in azole resilience by specific binding. Additionally, the biofilm is two times thicker than planktonic cells. Upon comparison of the chemical composition of planktonic cells with biofilm cells, it was observed that there is a difference in carbohydrate and β 1, 3 glucan composition (
