<p>Another major contributing element toward resistance is persister cells, which are the inconsequential subset of yeast cells with minimum metabolic activity assumed to be raised as a phenotypic variant but not a mutant type. They are highly resistant cells within biofilms. Amphotericin B treatment upon 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> led to the discovery of persister cells. These cells are acknowledged to be persister as they maintain themselves in a dormant stage. Still, in a stressful situation, they reactivate themselves to a state of active metabolism and reinstate as biofilms. Subsequently, drug sequestration by persister cells occurs due to some virulent traits like hyphal growth rather than an expression of efflux pumps and cell membrane structure (
