<p>According to recent studies, ten diverse surface receptors participate in this recognition pattern. They are Toll-like receptors -TLR4 and TLR2, TLR9, and NLR Family Pyrin Domain Containing 3 (NLRP3) the internal receptors, C-type lectin receptors, Dectin-1and 2, Dendritic Cell-Specific Intercellular adhesion molecule-3-Grabbing Non-integrin (DCSIGN), Mincle, and Mannose-binding lectin. Usually, these receptors recognize and bind to sugar moieties (Î²-1, 3-glucans, and mannose derivatives) present on the cell surface of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Due to this binding, the cytokine complement system gets activated, phagocytizing the fungal cells. Internal uptake of these fungal cells by APCs (antigen-presenting cells) expedites the activation of internal receptors; thus, resultant activation of TLR9 or NLRP3 inflammasome occurs. This non-specific immune response (innate response) has a significant role in preventing 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection. Besides, the adaptive immune response also makes its contribution by producing antibodies against some specific extracellular proteins, obstructing the 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> growth.
