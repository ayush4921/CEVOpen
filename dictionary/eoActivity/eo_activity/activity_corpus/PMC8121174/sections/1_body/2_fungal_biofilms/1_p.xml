<p>Fungal biofilms are the complex association of hyphal cells which in turn are associated with both abiotic and animal tissues. They are important virulence factors and correlated with invasive fungal infection (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Borghi et al., 2015</xref>). They are the sessile microorganisms that, when attached to the abiotic or biotic surfaces, lead to new phenotypic characteristic features (

 <italic>C. albicans</italic> form a complex association forming the biofilms, thus becoming responsible for a proportion of clinical candidiasis (
