<p>Furthermore, adherence of the fungal cell to the available biomaterial and its relatedness to bloodstream infections might be due to hematogenous spread. Medical devices provide a perfect niche to yeast cells because of their structure to chemical properties ranging from hydrophobicity to surface roughness. These devices are surrounded by body fluids like urine, blood, saliva, and synovial fluid, which condition them with glycoproteinaceous film (
