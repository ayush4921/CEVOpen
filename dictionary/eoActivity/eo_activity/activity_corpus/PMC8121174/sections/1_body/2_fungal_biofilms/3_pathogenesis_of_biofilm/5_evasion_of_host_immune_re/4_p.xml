<p>Neutrophils are the first foot soldiers of the immune system which are altered during biofilm formation. Neutrophils work with different modes of action like phagocytosis, oxidative response, and non-oxidative response against the emerging pathogen. Another known novel mechanism that was discovered in 2004, is the Neutrophil extracellular trap “NETosis.” It is a complex structure that comprises neutrophil chromatin, DNA, and protein. NETosis degranulates neutrophils and releases a lytic enzyme, which is different from necrosis and apoptosis. It has killing properties against planktonic yeast cells; however, it is seemingly ineffective against
