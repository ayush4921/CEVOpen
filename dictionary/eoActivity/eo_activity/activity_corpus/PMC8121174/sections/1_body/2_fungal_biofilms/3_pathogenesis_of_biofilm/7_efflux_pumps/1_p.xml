<p>Overexpression of efflux pumps is one of the major contributors to antifungal drug resistance in 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> as they lead to drug sequestration by pumping out the antifungal drugs given as a treatment. Subsequently, these are primarily concerned with first-generation azoles but ineffective toward Echinocandins resistance. During usual antifungal treatment toward planktonic cells, efflux pumps prevent the intracellular accumulation of antifungal drugs by up-regulating their expression (

 <xref rid="B170" ref-type="bibr">Tsui et al., 2016</xref>). The Cdr1, 2 (ATP binding cassette transporter superfamily), and Mdr1 (Major facilitator transporter superfamily) are the two major classes of efflux pumps that control drug exportation in 
 <italic>C. albicans.</italic> Moreover, initially, after a few hours of up-regulation in biofilms, they persist in being up-regulated all through the biofilm growth even in the absence of the antifungal drug. Rapid upregulation of efflux pumps happens during the primary stage of biofilm formation.
