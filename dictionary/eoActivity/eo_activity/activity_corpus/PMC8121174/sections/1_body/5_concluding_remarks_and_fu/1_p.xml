<p>The high mortality and morbidity rate owing to 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> biofilm infection is a big challenge in medical mycology. Since the formation of biofilm and biomaterial infections is a progressively alarming problem, this warrants the development of new antifungal agents and the search for newer targets. This review elucidates the pathogenic foundation and molecular mechanism of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> biofilms over antifungal drug resistance. A plethora of studies by several scientific groups and investigators have delivered essential knowledge regarding the pathogenesis associated with biofilm formation. These useful insights can represent an optimal starting point to find new therapeutic strategies related to drug resistance and mechanistic signals that govern 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> biofilm formation. Recent advances on different transcription factors, quorum sensing molecules, host response to adhesion, change in efflux pumps, enzymes, bud to hyphal transition, and change in lipid profile have broadened the knowledge of the complex mechanism underlying the biofilm resistance. Moreover, the development of new biomaterials with anti-adhesive properties, anti- infective lock therapies, high throughput phenotypic screening of small-molecule inhibitors, discovery and repurposing of naturally known compounds are under scrutiny. For medical instruments, a fine coating of nanomaterial may inhibit bacterial accumulation and biofilm formation. Recently, different metal nanoparticles have also emerged as antibiofilm agents against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and gaining momentum. Furthermore, different combinational therapies are harnessed for antibiofilm activity. Yet, the target-based approach is the need of the hour. For this multifaceted biofilm, the complex should be extensively studied to target different loops of phenotypic character change as they play a major role in biofilm formation. The detailed electron microscopic studies using both transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) with much greater resolution may add additional repertoire to our knowledge. Yet another approach may be the use of some engineered enzymes that do not allow colony formation and inhibit in turn the biofilm formation. Any compound used for this purpose may be empirically optimized for its dose, sensitivity, and efficacy before a search for a target is mounted.
