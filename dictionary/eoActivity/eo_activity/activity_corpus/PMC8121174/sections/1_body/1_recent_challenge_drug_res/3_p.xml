<p>Azoles are widely recommended antifungal drugs to treat superficial and invasive fungal infections. The first generation azoles include clotrimazole, bifonazole, econazole, and ketoconazole containing imidazole in their ring system. Fluconazole and itraconazole are some of the renowned examples of second- generation azoles., containing triazole moiety. Voriconazole and posaconazole are the FDA- approved broad -spectrum third generation azole- based antifungal drugs. They exhibit their antifungal effects by inhibiting cytochrome P450-dependent 14α-lanosterol demethylase (Cyp51) encrypted by the ERG11 gene which converts lanosterol to ergosterol (

It intercalates with the steroids ergosterol, found in the cell membrane, creating pores that obliterate the proton gradient of the cell, destabilizing the cell membrane causing leakage of the ions in the process. Another fungicidal drug, Echinocandins (e.g., Caspofungin), is the newest class of antifungals that acts against
