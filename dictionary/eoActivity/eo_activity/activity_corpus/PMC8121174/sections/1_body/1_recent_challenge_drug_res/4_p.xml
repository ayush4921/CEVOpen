<p>Analogs of nucleosides like 5-flucytosine (5-FC) are antimetabolites that imitate nucleotide bases in the course of the synthesis of nucleosides. The 5-Flucytosine acts as a pyrimidine correspondent disturbing the synthesis of fungal RNA, DNA, and protein leading to cell cycle arrest. The 5-FC in itself does not act as an antifungal agent but becomes active when changed into 5-fluorouracil. This conversion of 5-FC into 5-FU is catalyzed by the enzyme cytosine deaminase, residing in fungal cells but not present inside the host cells. Even with a vast diversity of antifungal drugs, the problem of resistance persists against the drug sequestration, making it challenging to fight. The classic inventions, polyenes and azoles, are also ineffective against

Thus, the indispensable development of new antifungal therapies with high efficiency against the biofilm mode of growth is required. Biofilms are the major contributors and intensifiers of antifungal resilience. As yet, none of these factors works alone. Instead, this antifungal resilience is a multifactorial phenomenon, which is still unexplored. Various factors of intrinsic resilience which alter normal vegetative cell to more virulent form have been listed briefly. These include an increase in the density of cells within the biofilm, complex association extracellular matrix, the existence of persister cells, gene expression of the antifungal resistance genes, and the proliferation of sterols on the membrane of biofilm cells (
