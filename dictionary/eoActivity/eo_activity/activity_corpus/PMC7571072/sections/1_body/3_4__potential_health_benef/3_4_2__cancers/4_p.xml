<p>Other studies have explored cannabinoid therapy in skin, pancreas, and colon cancers. Bl√°zquez et al. [
 <xref rid="B72-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] evaluated cannabinoid receptor agonists in mice and found that the activation of these receptors decreased the growth, proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis of melanomas. Through similar actions, cannabinoids induced apoptosis in pancreatic tumor cell lines, and the effects were lessened when the CB2 receptors were blocked [

 <xref rid="B74-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], where mice with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma treated with gemcitabine and CBD survived nearly three times as long as mice treated only with gemcitabine or with a vehicle. This was achieved through interference with the G-coupled protein receptor GPR55, resulting in the prevention of growth and cell cycle arrest [

 <xref rid="B75-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] investigated the activation of the cannabinoid receptors in colorectal cancer and demonstrated similar apoptotic mechanisms to pancreatic and melanoma cancers.
