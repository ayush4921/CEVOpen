<p>Several phytocannabinoids have exhibited the ability to mediate symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases and reduce compromising damage. Hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury results when the brain is deprived of oxygen and can lead to neurological impairments such as epilepsy, developmental delay, as well as reduced motor and cognitive function. Castillo, Tolón, Fernández-Ruiz, Romero, and Martinez-Orgado [
 <xref rid="B76-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] found that CBD enhanced neuroprotection in mice that experienced induced HI by oxygen and glucose withdrawal. Pazos et al. [
 <xref rid="B77-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] tested rats that underwent HI injury and subsequently received CBD treatment; the common measures of HI damage, infarct volume, and histological evaluation indicated CBD provided neuroprotection. Later, Pazos et al. [

Treatment with CBD prevents emotional and cognitive impairments, injury to white matter, degeneration of hippocampus tissue, and glial cell response decrease that result from brain ischemia, as well as promotes recovery through hippocampus dendritic cell reconstruction and neurogenesis in mice that already have brain ischemia [
