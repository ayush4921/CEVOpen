<p>Concentrated CBD from hemp has been shown in both pre-clinical and clinical studies to possess anxiolytic or antianxiety characteristics due to its ameliorating effect on limbic and paralimbic areas of the brain [

 <xref rid="B98-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Importantly, the anxiolytic effects of CBD are only induced with low concentrations; high concentrations may cause anxiogenic or panicogenic effects [

Other anxiety-related disorders also benefit from treatment with CBD, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression, as well as addiction recovery [

 <xref rid="B101-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. The endocannabinoid system is involved in learning, emotional responses (including those related to trauma), and regulation of emotional behavior; therefore, this system is an important target for the treatment of PTSD [

Using experimental animal models, CBD has been effectively used to treat the development of adverse associations at all steps of the process, including immediately after trauma to prevent the development of PTSD. CBD has been able to help in the extinction process of adverse memories in humans, as well as treat the anxiety-related symptoms accompanying PTSD without causing side effects [
