<p>The dietary intervention of hemp seed for cardiovascular health has been examined. Schwab et al. [
 <xref rid="B60-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] supplemented the human diet with 30 mL of hemp seed oil daily for four weeks and detected positive changes in the serum lipid profile. Another study also noted that rats fed a 5% or 10% hemp seed-supplemented diet for 12 weeks experienced an elevation in plasma LA and ALA levels [

After the diet, post-ischemic heart performance was assessed; the heart’s ability to recover from ischemia-reperfusion insult appeared to be directly related to the hemp seed’s PUFA. Richard, Ganguly, Steigerwald, Al-Khalifa, and Pierce [
 <xref rid="B62-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] also found that the integration of hemp seed into the rat diet significantly increased plasma LA and ALA levels. As a result, platelet aggregation was inhibited and slowed to a lower rate. The diminished likelihood of clot formation has implications for reducing the incidences of myocardial infarctions and strokes [

 <xref rid="B63-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] reported similar findings after examining the effect of dietary hemp seed for eight weeks in rabbits. Elevated plasma levels of PUFAs indirectly decreased the risk of platelet aggregation and myocardial infarction and provided better defense against hypercholesterolemia [
 <xref rid="B63-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Other issues caused by hypercholesteremia that were improved by supplementing hemp seed, including decreased cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and triglyceride levels, increased high-density lipoprotein levels, lower plaque, and fat deposition, and lower arterial wall damage [
