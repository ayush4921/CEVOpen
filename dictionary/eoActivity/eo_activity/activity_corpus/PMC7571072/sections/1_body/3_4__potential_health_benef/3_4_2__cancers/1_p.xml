<p>Since the first study exhibiting the anti-cancer effects of Cannabis phytochemicals by Munson, Harris, Friedman, Dewey, and Carchman [
 <xref rid="B65-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], there have been major advances in understanding the mechanisms and targeting action of cannabinoids. Evidence suggests that phyto-, endo-, and synthetic cannabinoids contain properties that aid in the treatment of the brain, prostate, breast, skin, pancreas, and colon cancer. Both in vitro and in vivo models suggest cannabinoids play a role in regulating cellular mechanisms causing anti-proliferative, anti-metastatic, anti-angiogenic, and pro-apoptotic responses [
