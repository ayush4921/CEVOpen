<p>In traditional Chinese folk medicine, hemp seed oil has been used to relieve chronic knee pain in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and improve blood circulation [

 <xref rid="B90-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>] concluded that hemp seed oil promotes the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), storage of lipids, production of endoplasmic reticulum stress markers, which act as anti-rheumatoid factors in downstream processes, and improved blood circulation, providing additional relief to RA patients. Hammell et al. [

A rat model was used to examine topical application of CBD: joint swelling, pain scores, synovial membrane thickness, infiltration of immune cells, and inflammation biomarkers were all significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner [
