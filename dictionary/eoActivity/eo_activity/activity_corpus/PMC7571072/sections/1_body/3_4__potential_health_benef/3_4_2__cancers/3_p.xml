<p>The treatment of prostate and breast cancers with CBD have also been explored. Sarfaraz et al. [
 <xref rid="B67-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] found that androgen-responsive human prostate carcinoma cells treated with CBD exhibited a pro-apoptotic response, inhibited cell growth, and a lowered secretion of prostate-specific antigen, which is typically elevated in cancerous cells [
