<p>Phytocannabinoids demonstrate the potential to inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in gliomas. Massi et al. [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] tested the effect of introducing CBD to U87 and U373 human glioma cell lines. In vitro treatment resulted in a reduction in mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and glioma cell viability. It was also confirmed that CBD induced apoptosis. When a CB2 receptor antagonist was introduced to the glioma cell lines, the antiproliferative effect of CBD was hindered, revealing its mechanism of action [

 <xref rid="B68-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] also looked at the implications of CBD on the U87 glioma cell line, where an anti-metastatic result was observed due to the inhibition of cell migration. Cannabinoids have also been found to prevent the differentiation and proliferation of glioma stem-like cells, which may help treat the difficult-to-eliminate nature of gliomas [
