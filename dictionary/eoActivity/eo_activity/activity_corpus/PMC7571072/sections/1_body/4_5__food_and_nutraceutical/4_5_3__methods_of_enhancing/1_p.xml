<p>To maintain oxidative stability, it is necessary to monitor the fatty-acid profiles throughout the extraction process to standardize temperature, pressure, and particle size required for supercritical CO

 <xref rid="B146-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>]. Hemp seed oil can maintain oxidative stability through the presence of tocopherols and polyphenols. Tocopherols effectively stop or slow down the lipoperoxidative radical chain reactions by preventing the oxidation of PUFAs [

 <sub>5</sub>â€“avenasterol can withstand high temperatures and reinforce the plasma membranes of eukaryotic cells. Storage studies must be conducted for hemp seed oil while observing the changes in composition and antioxidant activity.
