<p>Cold-pressed oils from seeds have become more commercially popular since they are viewed as natural and safe products to be used in food [

 <xref rid="B139-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. Cold-pressing passes the raw seed material through a conventional screw press, without the addition of harsh chemical solvents or high heat treatments [
