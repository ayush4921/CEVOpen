 <xref rid="B174-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>] concentrated and encapsulated the bioactive compounds extracted from hemp fiber processing waste, also called hemp fiber meal. Hemp fiber meal can be used for isolation of essential amino acids, especially arginine, by using food grade enzymes for polysaccharide digestion; the resulting polysaccharide fragments can be subjected to ultrafiltration and removed to concentrate the protein content, making it a superior isolate compared to other hemp protein products [
