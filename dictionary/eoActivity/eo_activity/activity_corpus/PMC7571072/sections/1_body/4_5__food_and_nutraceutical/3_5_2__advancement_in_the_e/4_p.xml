 <xref rid="B146-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>] optimized supercritical CO
 <sub>2</sub> extraction of hemp oil; they observed fatty-acid compositions and oxidative stability at different stages of the extraction process while varying the parameters to obtain maximum efficiency of extraction. In addition, AladiÄ‡ et al. [

 <xref rid="B148-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>] further refined the processing temperature, pressure, and time to determine how these conditions affect the constituency of hemp oil, especially focusing on fatty acids, tocopherol, and pigment content. Supercritical CO
 <sub>2</sub> using n-propane as a solvent, reduces the extraction pressure and preserves the physical and nutritional properties of hemp seed oil [
