<p>Some research has been done in improving oxidative stability and adhesion of hemp seed oil to surfaces such as skin or hair. A method of saponizing and quarternizing fatty acids [
 <xref rid="B161-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>] resulted in the minimization of oxidation and crosslinking of released essential fatty acids. Many cosmetic formulations of hemp seed oil were prepared with this method to improve adherence to skin. Maintenance of the antioxidant properties of the oil helps regulate oxidative stability as well. Temperature and pressure play a major role in altering oxidative stability; however, there is no universal standard that specifies the optimal conditions for maintaining oxidative stability as it varies greatly between extraction procedures. Hence, it is more likely that optimization at the local process level will help maintain the oxidative stability of hemp seed oil.
