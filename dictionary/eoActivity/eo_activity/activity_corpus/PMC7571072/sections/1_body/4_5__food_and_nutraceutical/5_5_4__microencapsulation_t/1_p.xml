 <xref rid="B171-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>] are the most predominant methods used for microencapsulation. Hemp seed oil is a prime candidate for these interventions to increase its nutritional value and benefits. The selection of the shell coating material to protect the core substance during microencapsulation depends on the microencapsulation method, the nature of the core material, the end use of the product, its physicochemical characteristics, and possible interactions with the core material [
