<p>There have been many innovations in hemp seed oil extraction. Optimized procedures to extract hemp seed oil rich in CBD by supercritical CO
 <sub>2</sub> are well established [

 <xref rid="B150-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>]. To remove pigments and waxes prior to supercritical CO
 <sub>2</sub> extraction, crushed silicon sand and ultrasonic-assisted extraction, respectively, can be used [

 <xref rid="B152-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]. Procedures to extract hemp seed oil free of THC have also been developed to satisfy regulatory requirements and societal concerns. Separation techniques such as chromatographic columns, and stabilization reactions such as oxidation with heat and isomerization with UV light, have been reported [

 <xref rid="B154-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>]. Dynamic maceration with ethanol for 45 min is an efficient method to extract non-THC cannabinoids from hemp seed oil [
 <xref rid="B155-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>]. New methods using ultrasonication-assisted extraction are also gaining interest due to minimal intervention with the product and shorter extraction time [
 <xref rid="B156-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>,
 <xref rid="B157-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>]. Similarly, the response surface method has been used to optimize the microwave-assisted extraction of cannabinoids, which also provides a shorter extraction time [
 <xref rid="B158-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>]. Recently, many advances have been made to combine different techniques, such as supercritical fluid extraction, ultrasonication, and microwave-assisted extraction, to increase efficiency [
 <xref rid="B156-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>]. Hemp seed oil extracted through the above methods are different in yield, physical properties, and chemical composition. Furthermore, the cost is also an important factor in the selection of the extraction method. Considering an initial economic cost-benefit analysis, supercritical CO
 <sub>2</sub> extraction is most efficient, followed by Soxhlet extraction and ultrasonication [
 <xref rid="B138-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. In terms of scale-up extraction, ultrasonication and Soxhlet extraction are the best methods, while the desirable omega-6 PUFA/omega-3 PUFA ratio can be achieved by the Soxhlet extraction method [
 <xref rid="B138-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. Selecting the most appropriate method of extraction depends on the end use and desired bioactives in the final products.
