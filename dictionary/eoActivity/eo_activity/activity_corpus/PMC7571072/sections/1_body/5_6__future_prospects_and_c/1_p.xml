<p>Since ancient times, hemp has been cultivated to provide nutritional and medicinal benefits. Although the government regulations repressed the cultivation and scientific inquiry of industrial hemp in the past, under recent legalization with stringent production regulations, hemp has proven to hold viable, value-added food and nutraceutical applications (

Recently, many studies have demonstrated that the nutrient and bioactive composition of hemp contributes to the prevention and treatment of several ailments suggesting its potential as a valuable functional food ingredient. This review sought to highlight these advances in understanding the medical, nutritional, and nutraceutical benefits of industrial hemp. The ease of production and suitability to many climatic and geographical locations are assets to the expansion of this industrial crop. Due to its versatility, breeding of hemp is underway in many universities and breeding centers across North America and Europe to develop high-yielding varieties for both fiber and oil seed production. This will help standardize varieties across different growing regions, thus maintaining quality and reducing disease and insect pressure. The controversial association of industrial hemp with medical Cannabis has also slowed expansion efforts. Therefore, breeding of hemp to clearly differentiate it from medical Cannabis may accelerate its development and consumer acceptance, as well as ease regulatory barriers of the crop.
