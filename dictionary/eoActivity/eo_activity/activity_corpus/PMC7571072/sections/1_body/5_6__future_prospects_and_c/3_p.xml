<p>For innovation of novel hemp-derived food ingredients and nutraceuticals requires precise identification and quantification of major bioactives and standardization of the products. The analytical methods required for bioactives such as CBD need to be standardized. To ensure the authenticity and safety of hemp-derived food and nutraceuticals, it is important to quantify the amount of THC in the final product and includes it in the label. For example, in North America and most of Europe, to classify as industrial hemp, THC content should not exceed 0.3% on a dry weight basis. If the regulatory agencies could make a requirement for declaring THC content, that will help the food and nutraceutical industry to stay away from complicated regulatory issues around medical Cannabis. Since the impact of CBD is dose-dependent, an acceptable limit of CBD to be determined for inclusion in the labels of nutraceuticals and dietary supplements. The manufacturers should be aware that CBD content may change from batch-to-batch due to the variations of sources of materials, growing conditions, and manufacturing. Future investigations should also be aimed at quantification of trace cannabinoids other than THC and CBD and exploring their pharmacological effects. The pharmacokinetics of these bioactives, when incorporated in different food matrices, need to be understood. The inclusion of the content of omega-3 PUFA and omega-6 PUFA and their ratio in the label is useful for consumers to recognize the benefits of hemp oil and other value-added food products.</p>
