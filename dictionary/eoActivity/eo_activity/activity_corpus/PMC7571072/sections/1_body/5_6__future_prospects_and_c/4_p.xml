<p>Most of the health benefits-associated research of industrial hemp has been conducted under pre-clinical conditions. However, due to the possibility of concentrating bioactive phytochemicals during the manufacturing process, the industry should pay attention to the dosing to optimize the potential health benefits and avoid possible safety concerns. There is a need to conduct appropriately designed, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical studies on the effects of hemp-derived functional food ingredients and products, dietary supplements, and nutraceuticals on the promotion of human health. The hemp seed oil has potential as a nutraceutical due to the desired ratio of omega-6 PUFA to omega-3 PUFAs, and the bioactive CBD. Future research should focus on exploring other bioactive phytochemicals of industrial hemp, such as polyphenols and isoprenoids. The contribution of polyphenols and isoprenoids of hemp to the sensory quality, shelf life, and health benefits of the final products still to be understood. Overall, the hemp industry is starting to flourish across the globe. Regulatory agencies need to distinguish industrial hemp from medical Cannabis (marijuana), so the economic potential of industrial hemp as a sustainable source of value-added functional food ingredients and nutraceutical products can be realized.</p>
