<p>Recent research indicates genome-wide differences that are not confined to the THC biosynthetic pathway [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A principal component analysis plot of 81 medical Cannabis and 43 hemp samples obtained from 14,301 single-nucleotide polymorphisms indicated a clear genetic structural difference between hemp and medical Cannabis samples. The hemp samples were more heterogenous than medical Cannabis, indicating the hemp samples came from a wide genome pool, whereas the medical Cannabis samples had a relatively narrow genetic base [

Though there are known genetic structural differences, a detailed examination of the genes involved in differentiation, and their corresponding phenotype changes, will provide more input into the genetic basis of the differences between hemp and medical Cannabis. Hemp is resurging in cultivation and production, so care must be taken to conserve the genetic diversity to ensure the long-term survival of the crop.
