<p>Industrial hemp and medical Cannabis have primarily been differentiated by their levels of THC production. The cannabinoids (THC and cannabidiol [CBD, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04078-f002">Figure 2</xref>]) profile and the morphology of the plant are determined by the interaction of genetics and the environment. Genetically, medical Cannabis possesses the B
 <sub>T</sub> allele that encodes for tetra-hydrocannabinolic acid synthase, while hemp produces the B
 <sub>D</sub> allele encoding for canabidiolic acid (CBDA) synthase [

 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] studied the transcriptome of female flowers from hemp and medical Cannabis, concluding that there was an up-regulation in the entire THC production pathway in medical Cannabis compared to hemp. This difference translates to producing upwards of 10% THC in many medical Cannabis samples, whereas most hemp samples have a total THC level of 0.3% or less [
