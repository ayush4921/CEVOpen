<p>Most researchers consider that Cannabis has only one species, 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic> L. In the 1970s, Small and Cronquist [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] separated it into two subspecies: subsp. 
 <italic>indica</italic>, with relatively high amounts of the psychoactive constituent delta-9-tetra-hydrocannabinol (THC), and subsp. 
 <italic>sativa</italic>, with low amounts of THC. The two subspecies can be further broken down into wild and domesticated varieties; under subsp. 
 <italic>sativa</italic>, var. 
 <italic>sativa</italic> is domesticated and var. 
 <italic>spontanea</italic> is wild, and under subsp. 
 <italic>indica</italic>, var. 
 <italic>indica</italic> is domesticated and var. 
 <italic>kafiristanica</italic> is wild [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. According to these systematics, the modern industrial hemp varieties would belong to subsp. 
 <italic>sativa</italic>, and most medical Cannabis (also called “marijuana”) varieties would belong to subsp. 
 <italic>indica</italic>. However, there are numerous hybrids blurring the line. A contradiction to the above observation has also been reported [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Hemp and medical Cannabis strains with 100% 
 <italic>C. indica</italic> ancestry possessed higher genetic variance than strains with 100% 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic> ancestry. Another study using Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA markers of hemp and medical Cannabis also indicated that hemp aligns more with 
 <italic>C. indica</italic> than 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Hillig [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] also strongly opposed the 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic> classification of hemp due to many Asian hemp accessions exhibiting more commonalities with 
 <italic>C. indica</italic>. Apart from indicating a high admixture between the 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic> and 
 <italic>C. indica</italic> genetic pools, these results also suggest that the genetic lineage analysis did not conform to the currently recognized classification, and we may have to revisit the taxonomy of these species to better reflect new genetic information coming to light.
