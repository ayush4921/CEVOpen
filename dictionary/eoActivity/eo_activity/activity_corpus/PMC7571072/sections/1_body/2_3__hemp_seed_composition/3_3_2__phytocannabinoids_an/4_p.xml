<p>The pharmacology or interaction of THC and CBD with the endocannabinoid system is not yet fully understood and seems complicated. THC has been shown to provide most of the psychoactive effects through the CB1 receptor as an agonist; however, under certain conditions, THC act as an antagonist of the CB1 receptor and also shown to interact with CB2 receptor [

CBD antagonizes synthetic agonists of CB1 and CB2 receptors and can be considered to be a negative allosteric modulator of CB1 and CB2 receptors. Moreover, recent findings also indicate that CBD exhibits various dose-dependent physiological responses. Though the low doses (30 mg oral) has no intoxicating effects, high doses (300 mg oral) increased somnolence and reduced anxiety [

 <sub>1A</sub> receptors, binding to non-cannabinoid receptors such as transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), and the orphan receptor G protein-coupled receptor 55 (GPR55) [

 <xref rid="B57-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. CBD has recently received increasing interest since chronic administration of CBD has shown potential therapeutic properties such as antiepileptic, anxiolytic, antipsychotic, neuroprotective activities, and benefits against disorders of motility and epilepsy [
