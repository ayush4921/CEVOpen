<p>Hemp flowers and herbage contain valuable phytocannabinoids, which are naturally occurring cannabinoids that are unique to the Cannabis plant [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. All industrial hemp varieties contain THC, CBD, and other cannabinoids, although the concentrations in some varieties are very low to non-detectable. In northern latitudes, industrial hemp has a particularly high content of CBD and low content of THC [
