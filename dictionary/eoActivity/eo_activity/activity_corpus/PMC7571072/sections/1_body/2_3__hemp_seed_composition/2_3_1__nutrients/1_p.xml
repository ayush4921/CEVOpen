<p>The major constituents of hemp seed include easily digestible protein (20–25%), polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), abundant lipids (25–35%), and carbohydrates (20–30%) high in insoluble fiber (

 <xref rid="B39-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. LA concentrations range from 64 to 72% of the total fatty-acid composition. This range can be a result of the variation of different hemp cultivars, cultivation techniques, as well as processing and storage conditions. These fatty acids must be acquired from the diet, as they are needed for proper nutrition but cannot be synthesized endogenously [

Nutritional recommendations indicate that 15–20% of daily caloric intake should come from fats, and approximately one-third of these fats should be essential fatty acids in a 3:1 ratio. It is estimated that this dietary goal can be met with three tablespoons of hemp seed oil [
