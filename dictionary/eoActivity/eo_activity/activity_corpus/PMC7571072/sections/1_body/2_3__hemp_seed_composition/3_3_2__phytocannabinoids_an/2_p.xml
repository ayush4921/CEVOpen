<p>The biosynthesis of CBD begins with the polyketide pathway and the plastidal 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate pathway, which lead to the synthesis of olivetolic acid and geranyl diphosphate, respectively. These precursors undergo condensation to form cannabigerolic acid (CBGA), which is then converted to cannabidiolic acid (CBDA). Decarboxylation of CBDA occurs spontaneously or with the addition of heat to form CBD [

These phytocannabinoids can be classified into 11 different classes, namely: (−)-delta-9-trans-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), (−)-delta-8-trans-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ8-THC), cannabigerol (CBG), cannabichromene (CBC), CBD, cannabinodiol (CBND), cannabielsoin (CBE), cannabicyclol (CBL), cannabinol (CBN), cannabitriol (CBT) and miscellaneous-type cannabinoids. Recently, besides THC and CBD, 30 other cannabinoids from commercial hemp seed oil have been identified using high-resolution mass spectrometry [
