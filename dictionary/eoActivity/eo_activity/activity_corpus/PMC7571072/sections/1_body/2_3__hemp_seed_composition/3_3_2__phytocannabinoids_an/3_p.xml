<p>The endocannabinoid system of humans is an endogenous signaling system consists of endocannabinoids, enzymes involved in their synthesis and degradation, cannabinoid receptors, and other associated elements [

 <xref rid="B51-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The system is modulated by diet, sleep, exercise, stress, among many others. The endocannabinoids are fatty-acid-derived neurotransmitters that act as signal molecules of coordinating intercellular communication across all physiological systems. One of the primary functions of the system is to restore homeostasis following cellular stressors. The two most studied endocannabinoids are anandamide-
 <italic>N</italic>-arachidonylethanolamine (AEA) and 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG). Phytocannabinoids are recognized as pharmacologically active compounds, which function by interacting with the endocannabinoid system in humans [

 <xref rid="B53-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The CB1 receptor is primarily present in the brain and spinal cord but also found on certain cells of the immune system, adipose tissues, liver, muscle, reproductive cells, kidney, and lungs. CB1 mediates the release of neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, noradrenaline, dopamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and glutamate. The CB2 receptor is expressed mainly in the cells in the periphery, in the organs of the immune system and have a role in the release of cytokines and the modulation of immune cell migration [
