<p>Industrial hemp has been grown as a commodity fiber crop in North America since the mid-18th century until the 1930s. Hemp fell under the umbrella of “marijuana” in the 1930s, and its production was prohibited in Canada under the Narcotics Control Act [

Hemp production decreased in Europe and the Americas in the late 19th century due to several factors including the replacement of sail ships with steamships, the availability of abaca fiber and rope, and the availability of other less expensive and softer fibers such as cotton. In addition, synthetic fibers such as polyester, nylon, and acrylic were invented in the 1930s and 1940s, and became major fiber competitors after WWII [
