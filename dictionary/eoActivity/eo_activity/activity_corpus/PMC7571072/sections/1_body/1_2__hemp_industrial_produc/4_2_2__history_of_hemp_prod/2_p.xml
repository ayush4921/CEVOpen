<p>In terms of prohibition, industrial hemp was guilty by its association with medical Cannabis [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. As mentioned above, both hemp and medical Cannabis belong to the same plant species 
 <italic>Cannabis sativa</italic> L. but are cultivated differently and vary in their phytochemical constituents [

In the USA, the 2014 Farm Bill permitted “Institutions of higher education” and state agriculture departments to grow hemp under a pilot program if state law permitted it; however, some production aspects were still subject to Drug Enforcement Administration oversight [

The 2018 Farm Bill legalized the production of hemp as an agricultural commodity, removed hemp from the list of controlled substances, and listed it as a covered commodity crop under crop insurance [
