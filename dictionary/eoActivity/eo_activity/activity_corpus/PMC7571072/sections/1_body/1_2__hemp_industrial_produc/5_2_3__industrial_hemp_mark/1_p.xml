<p>Globally, the industrial hemp market remains in China, where approximately half of the world’s fiber hemp supply is produced [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The resurgence of interest in hemp crop can be attributed to the demand for sustainable agricultural practices, along with the recognition of hemp’s superior fiber content and nutritional profile. Primarily in central and western Canada, 340 cultivation licenses were issued to farmers who grew more than 39,000 acres of industrial hemp in 2011 [

Future economic prospects for the crop are unclear; there is competition for land with other crops as well as with medical Cannabis, which can pose an issue due to its ability to crossbreed with hemp, causing issues with the THC content in both crops. There is also global competition; production is increasing rapidly in many places and may exceed demand, driving down profits for hemp [
