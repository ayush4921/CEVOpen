<p>As a fiber crop, hemp provides a high yield; it produces 250% more fiber than cotton and 600% more fiber than flax, from the same acreage [

 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Due to the fast-growing, dense canopy, fiber hemp is a natural weed suppressor and could be grown without herbicides; it also suppresses levels of fungi and nematodes in the soil and can be grown without fungicides or pesticides [

Hemp contributes to the maintenance of soil quality by its anchored roots, which prevent soil erosion and nutrient leaching, may extract nutrients from deeper soil layers, and are effective for phytoremediation by absorbing heavy metal contaminants from the soil and storing them within the plant. The continual shedding of leaves through the growing season adds moist organic matter to the soil [

 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Because of the functions in improving the soil quality, hemp is a prime candidate to be used for crop rotation programs to improve the yield of the main crop [
