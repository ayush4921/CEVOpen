<p>The cultivation of industrial hemp is more efficient and less environmentally degrading than that of many other crops [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Hemp can be grown under a variety of agro-ecological conditions and has a capacity to grow quickly, especially after the first 4–5 weeks after emergence, making it an excellent candidate for carbon sequestration [

 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Hemp grows best in sandy loam with good water retention and drainage at temperatures between 16–27 °C, in nutrient balanced soil (especially nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, copper, and others). The planting density depends on the type of crop. Fiber hemp does well in high density to encourage stalk growth, but oilseed and CBD hemp should be planted farther apart to encourage greater branching and flower yields [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Densely seeded fiber varieties may reach 5–6 m tall, while some recent grain varieties may only reach 1–1.2 m tall. Many multiple-use or resin cultivars are intermediate in height. Industrial hemp is either harvested for the stalk or seeds, whereas the flowering buds are collected from the narcotic type cultivars [

 <xref rid="B14-molecules-25-04078" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, architecture also strongly depends on plant density, day length, and nutrients and moisture available in the soil [
