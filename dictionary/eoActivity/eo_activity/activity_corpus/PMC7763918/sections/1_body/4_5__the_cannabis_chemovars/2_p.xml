<p>Among the cannabis strains analyzed by Shapira, Berman, Futoran, Guberman, and Meiri [
 <xref rid="B75-molecules-25-05792" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>], five chemotype groups were elucidated according the predominant terpenes: (i) β-myrcene, (ii) α- and β-pinene, (iii) β-caryophyllene and limonene, (iv) β-caryophyllene, and (v) terpinolene. In the sensory perception of the terpene profile differences among cannabis strains, two distinct descriptive clustering groups were nominated [
