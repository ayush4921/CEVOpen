<p>Taxonomists classified cannabis plants into three species in the early days: (i) 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic> Linnaeus, (ii) 
 <italic>C. indica</italic> Lamarck, and (iii) 
 <italic>C. ruderalis</italic> [

 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-05792" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Today, many researchers are convinced that the cannabis that grows commercially is 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic> L, but the subvariety “sativa” should be known as hemp and the subvariety “Indica” should be called recreational cannabis or marijuana. The differences in these subvarieties are shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05792-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The usable part for hemp is the stem in particular, while parts usually with trichomes are the usable parts for the cannabis. The level of THC is graded as &gt;2% of dry weight and flowers give a much higher terpene content, which becomes sticky to the touch [

Morphologically, the leaf of cannabis is broader and the color is darker compared to that of hemp. Many recent studies have attempted to separate the combination of the terpene composition in several species of Cannabaceae where it is apparent that hemp and the Indica cannabis are closely related. For example, hemp can also yield terpene profiles similar to those of marijuana [
