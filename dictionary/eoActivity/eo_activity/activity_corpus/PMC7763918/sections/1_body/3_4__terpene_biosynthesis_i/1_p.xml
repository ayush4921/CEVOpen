<p>The energy required for plant growth and development derives from photosynthesis, respiration, and transpiration with O
 <sub>2</sub>, CO
 <sub>2</sub>, nutrients, and water. The energy is restored in the form of primary chemical ingredients that plants later exploit. These primary metabolites include carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. However, during cycles of growth and reproduction, plants might be challenged by stresses including hard environmental conditions or pests and herbivores. Plants then produce different groups of compounds called secondary metabolites that are used as defenses to those challenges. For example, it can produce compounds that draw in pollinators including birds to help them in the fertilization process or seed dispersion [

 <xref rid="B45-molecules-25-05792" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]; for example, alkaloids such as morphine and codeine in opium give psychoactive and pain relief activity to mammals. Phenolics and flavonoids found in the skins of fruits and berries possess antioxidant activity [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-25-05792" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Sulfur containing compounds such as allicin in garlic can be used to reduce lipoglycerides in the blood and also have the ability to stimulate appetite [

 <xref rid="B49-molecules-25-05792" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], are used as food additives and some depict psychoactive ability and aroma characteristics such as those found in the cannabis. Terpenes are hydrocarbons with small isoprene units linked to one another to form chains, while terpenoids are oxygen-containing terpenes. Three types of terpenes/terpenoids are usually found in the cannabis plant which are (i) monoterpenes (10C) of two isoprene units; (ii) sesquiterpenes (15C) of three isoprenes; (iii) diterpenes (20C) of four isoprenes; and (iv) triterpenes (30C) of six isoprenes [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-25-05792" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. To date, more than 200 volatiles have been reported from the different cannabis genotypes of which 58 monoterpenes and 38 sesquiterpenes have been characterized [

 <xref rid="B56-molecules-25-05792" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The cannabinoids are biologically synthesized from diterpene structures to form phenol terpenoids, which account for almost a quarter of all metabolites [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-25-05792" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Thus, the combination of the terpenes provides the unique aromas to different strains.
