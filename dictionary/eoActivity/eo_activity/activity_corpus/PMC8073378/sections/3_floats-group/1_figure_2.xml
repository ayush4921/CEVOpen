  <p>Analgesic effects of the 
   <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic> extracts as assessed by the hot-plate pain-induction method in mice. Values are denoted as mean ± SEM, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 6 animals/group. The statistical significance was performed via a one-way ANOVA followed by a posthoc test using Tukey’s multi-group comparison: * 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, ** 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, and *** 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 compared to the olive oil control group. For example, at 120 min compared to the olive oil group, the diclofenac, n-hexane, and chloroform extracts groups were significantly different * 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05.
