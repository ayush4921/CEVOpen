 <caption>
  <p>Anti-oxidant potentials of 
   <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic> extracts are expressed as scavenging reactivity towards DPPH free radicals (
   <bold>A</bold>) and the iron-chelating effects (
   <bold>B</bold>). Statistical significance was performed by two-way ANOVA (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). According to Tukeyâ€™s method, the extracts groups at all the measured concentrations were significantly different (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) compared to quercetin in both Figures (
   <bold>A</bold>,
   <bold>B</bold>).
