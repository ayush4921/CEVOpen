<p>To complement our ongoing work on the locally-encountered halophytic plants, their constituents, and bioactivities in general, and the traditionally-claimed health-benefits and pharmacological properties, investigations on 
 <italic>Haloxylon, Cichorium, Tamarix, Ipomea</italic>, 
 <italic>Zygophyllum</italic>, 
 <italic>Styrax,</italic> and 
 <italic>Suaeda</italic> [

 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-02384" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], together with 
 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic> were planned. The current study was designed to investigate the anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities of 
 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic> extracts and their related phytochemical constituents and anti-oxidant potentials. 
 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic> was of particular interest due to its immense nutritional and folklore-based anti-inflammation and pain removal applications.
