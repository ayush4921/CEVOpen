<p>The current study provided confirmations of the traditionally claimed anti-inflammation and analgesic bioactivities of the halophytic herb. The frequent use of the 
 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic> aerial parts as animal-feed, emergency-food, salad, medicine, and nutraceutical was corroborated with the richness of the phytoconstituents, especially the flavonoids, and phenolics in the plant. The comparatively higher levels of the trace and essential elements in the plant, as compared to the non-halophytic plants, provided support to the exhibition of plant’s nutritional value, and pharmacological action of anti-inflammation and the analgesic bioactivity, which is also a factor of the phenolics, flavonoids, and other phytoconstituents presence in the plant. The cytotoxic and acute toxicity testing confirmed the safety of the plant’s use albeit under the limits of the tested dose, and to an extent of the use-period and dose frequency. Additionally, the molecular mechanistic details of these pharmacological actions, the role of trace elements, and detailed confirmations of the plant’s nutritional values need further study. The investigations on the chloroform, ethyl acetate, and aq.-ethanol extracts, especially the aq.-ethanol extract, holds promise for encountering new flavonoid(s) and phenolics-based structural entities of biological activity interest, which could also be a new molecule or a new molecular template of structural interest. The phytochemical investigations of the aq.-ethanol extract, together with the chloroform and ethyl acetate extracts, may lead to novel glycosylated flavonoid(s), and structures of polar phenolics nature, followed by probably, hereto unknown and novel alkaloid constituent(s) and other compounds from various other types of chemical classes, all towards finding new molecular templates for analgesic action, and anti-inflammation active non-steroidal structure-type drug discovery lead. The possibilities of finding new structural templates, also suitable for various anti-oxidant-based pharmacological activities of neurological disorders, are presumably waiting to be discovered.
