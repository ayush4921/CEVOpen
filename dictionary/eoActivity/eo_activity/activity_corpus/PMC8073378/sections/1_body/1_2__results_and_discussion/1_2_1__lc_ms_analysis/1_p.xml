<p>Liquid chromatography-coupled-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis was used to analyze the plantâ€™s total extract obtained from 95%-aqueous ethanol obtained from the aerial parts of 
 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic>, and the identified compounds are listed in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02384-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. A total of fifty-two constituents, representing 18.24% of the total LC-MS displayed constituents were identified, which included the tentatively identified constituents also. The molecular mass, mass spectral fragmentation patterns of the constituents, and standard samples were utilized for the purpose. Out of all the identified compounds, flavonoid aglycones and flavonoid glycosides, phenolics, and fatty acids were in a significant numbers at 53.84% (28 compounds), 23.08% (12 compounds), and 9.60% (5 compounds), respectively. The flavonoid and its glycosides and the phenolics constituted about 76.92% of the total identified products. Out of 52 compounds, seven constituents were identified through comparison with the standards injected during the LC-MS analysis. The triterpenes were 1.92% of these products, while diterpene, coumarin, alkaloid, disaccharide, other aromatic entities, and aliphatics-natured compounds, other than fatty acids, constituted, each, at 1.65% of the characterized constituents. These miscellaneous categories of di- and triterpenes, coumarin, alkaloid, disaccharide, dicarboxylic acid, aromatic entities, and aliphatics together constituted 11.56% of all the identified components from the 95% aqueous-ethanolic extract. Quantitatively, the flavonoids and phenolics were the major constituents. The high occurrence of the flavonoids and phenolic derivatives were also corroborated by the quantitative analysis of the dried extracts for categories of the compounds in the aqueous-ethanolic extract, which showed the major presence of flavonoids and phenolics in different extracts. From the LC-MS analysis, kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside (retention time 4.22 min), scutellarein-7-glucuronide (4.60 min), hesperidin (4.90), 8-prenyl naringenin (5.90 min), isobavachin (7.35 min), artocarpin (8.69 min), genistin (8.80 min), corymbosin (12.71 min), and pseudobaptigenin (13.68 min) were identified as the flavonoid and flavonoid glycosides derivatives. The palmitoleic acid (25.50 min), linoleic acid (27.91 min), oleic acid (28.23 min), and Octadecanoic acid (29.94 min) were parts of the constituents of the fatty acid. The medicagenic acid (castanogenin) was identified as the triterpenoidal component from the 95% aqueous-ethanolic extract analysis. The caffeic acid, a well-known anti-oxidant, and its derivative, caffeic acid phenethyl ester, were also present in the 95% aqueous-ethanolic extract and identified through their comparisons with the standard samples ran during the LC-MS chromatographic analysis. The 4-methyl umbelliferone was the sole product identified as the coumarin class of compound.
