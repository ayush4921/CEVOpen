<p>The analgesic activities of the extracts were assessed using the hot plate, a centrally mediated pain-induced mice model. The central and peripheral analgesic effects were assessed using a hot-plate and acetic-acid writhing methods, respectively. The hot-plate technique evaluated the time taken by the animal to feel the sensation of the pain generated by the response through initiation at the peripheral nerve endings, and the propagation of the pain sensation to the brain. The animals that received the aqueous-ethanolic extract showed comparable analgesia to the diclofenac group at all time points compared with the olive-oil group control. For the aqueous-ethanolic extract group, the inhibition of pain increased by 89.86% (
