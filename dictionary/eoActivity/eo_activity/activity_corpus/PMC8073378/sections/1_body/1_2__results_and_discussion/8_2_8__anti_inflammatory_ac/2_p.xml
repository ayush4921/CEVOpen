<p>During the current study, the carrageenan-induced paw edema method was used to assess the anti-inflammatory activity of the 
 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic> extracts in comparison with a negative vehicle (olive oil) control and a positive (diclofenac) control. The carrageenan-induced inflammation control, with lowest paw-volume maintenance at 1, 2, 3, and 6 h, and at par with the diclofenac group after 24 h by the aqueous-ethanolic extract substantiated the roles of the anti-oxidant constituents in the extract, i.e., phenolics and flavonoids, which together are at the highest concentrations (136.08 ± 0.12 mg/g, 3.19 ± 0.03 mg/g, GAE, and QE, respectively) in the extract. However, for the experimental animals receiving the negative vehicle, edema volume increased after carrageenan induction at 0 h (1.03 ± 0.01), and reached the peak after 6 h (1.54 ± 0.02), followed by a gradual decrease over the 24 h period to 1.47 ± 0.01 of the paw volume. For the aqueous-ethanolic extract group, the inhibition of inflammation increased by 16.79% (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) at 1 h compared with the negative control, and showed a peak inhibition of inflammation at 41.07% (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) after a 2 h period (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02384-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). The inhibitions of inflammation gradually decreased to 24.82% (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) and 9.39% (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) after 6 and 24 h, respectively, as compared with the olive-oil control group. These results were similar to the diclofenac control group and concurred with our findings that the aqueous-ethanolic extract was richest in the anti-oxidants phenolics and flavonoids, and the phytoconstituents played its role well.
