<p>As a halophytic plant, the 
 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic> is a potential source of essential minerals and a probable source of accumulated toxic heavy metals from the harsh and elements-rich sandy and saline environment [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-26-02384" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Since the salinity enhances the mobility of heavy metals in this type of soil [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-02384" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], the identification of 
 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic> trace elements was important from the viewpoint that the plant is used as an animal feed in its growing areas. It was pertinent to investigate trace elementsâ€™ presence because the trace elements could also play a role in the bioactivity, oxidative stress, and the anti-oxidant defensive mechanisms of the plant against environment-triggered oxidative damages [

 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic> powder contains a substantial concentration of magnesium (Mg) at 2.90 mg/kg (

 <italic>S. tomentosa</italic> and less than 
 <italic>S. rigida</italic>, and both the plants are found in different, but antagonistic environments as reported in a previous study [
