<p>The ROS, free radicals and unstable molecules cause damage to cells. The inflammation may increase in ROS, which is needed to be countered by the radical scavengers. In the current study, the extract containing higher concentrations of phenolics and flavonoid compounds together (aqueous-ethanolic) worked as a better radical scavenger, which correlated well with the corresponding extract’s anti-inflammatory effects. The high concentrations of phenolics and flavonoid compounds in the 
 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic> extract indicated their strong anti-inflammatory potential, which likely is mediated through inhibitions of prostaglandin (PG) and cyclooxygenase (COX) receptors. The flavonoids are known to inhibit the nuclear factors transcription, cytokines, and COX, and help to inhibit chemical mediators’ production from stopping the edema formation [
