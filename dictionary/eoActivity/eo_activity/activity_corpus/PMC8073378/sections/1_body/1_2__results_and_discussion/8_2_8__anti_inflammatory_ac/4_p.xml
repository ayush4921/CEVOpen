<p>The reactive oxygen species (ROS), free radicals, and other unstable molecular entities cause damage to the cells. The inflammation entails an increase in ROS, which is countered by radical scavengers, mainly the plants’ flavonoids and phenolics phytoconstituents. In the current study, the extract containing higher concentrations of phenolics and flavonoid compounds worked as a better radical scavenger, which was well correlated with the anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of the extracts as reported earlier [

 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic> extracts indicated the strong anti-inflammatory potency, which has been reported to be mediated through blocking the prostaglandins (PG) and cyclooxygenase (COX) receptors [

 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic>, may also be better exhibited due to the comparatively higher presence of Mg, Cu, and Zn contents in the plant, as compared to other normal-environment habited plants. Additionally, the molecular mechanism of pain-relieving effects after dietary zinc supplementation in mice is known [
