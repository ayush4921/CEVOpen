<p>The aqueous-ethanolic and ethyl acetate extracts showed a significant reduction of inflammation in both stages, while the n-hexane and chloroform extracts showed significant anti-inflammatory activity during stage one only, and that too was dependent upon the responses time. The effects of the aqueous-ethanolic extract were comparable to the diclofenac (sodium), which is known to exhibit higher binding affinity to the accumulated proteins in the inflamed tissues at significantly higher levels, as compared to the plasma, which is also known to act by inhibition of PGs through blockade of COX [
