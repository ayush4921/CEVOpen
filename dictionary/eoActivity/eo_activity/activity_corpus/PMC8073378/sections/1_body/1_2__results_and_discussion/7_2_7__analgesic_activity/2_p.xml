The extracts’ analgesic effects decreased at 30 min by −31.25%, −157.50%, and −42.50% for aqueous-ethanolic, ethyl acetate, and chloroform extracts, respectively, compared to the control. The concurrent slow onset of the actions of the extracts indicated that the pain threshold did not reach its limit through the depression of the pain receptors in the brain, or there is a delay in the firing of the nociceptors, or the early and late nociceptive phases, which showed the dissimilar pain effects [

 <xref rid="B44-molecules-26-02384" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The aqueous-ethanolic extract group showed significantly increased pain inhibitions at 60, 90, and 120 min. In comparison, the ethyl acetate and chloroform extracts showed biphasic responses with the peak analgesic activity at 60 min, followed by dipping in the analgesic activity at 90 min. The highest analgesic activity of 56.16% and 71.23%, respectively, were observed at 120 min.
