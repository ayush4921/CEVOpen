<p>The current study involved investigating the inhibition of inflammation using carrageenan-induced inflammation, a preliminary screening inflammatory model producing acute and reproducible inflammation. The induced inflammation occurs in two stages. The primary stage (1–2 h) involves the production of chemical mediators, i.e., histamine, serotonin, and bradykinin, and the second stage (3–6 h) involves an increase in PG, leukotrienes, and free radicals, leading to significant vascular permeability, together with an influx of neutrophils that lead to edema formation through a build-up of plasma fluid. The flavonoids are known inhibitors of inflammation in both stages through cytokines, and COX [
