 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic> at concentrations of 319 µg/kg and 109 µg/kg, respectively. In contrast, the maximum permissible limits of lead and cadmium in medicinal plants, determined by the World Health Organization (WHO) are 10 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg, respectively [

 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic>, growing locally are far below the prescribed toxic limits, and it is an indication of the plant’s safety.
