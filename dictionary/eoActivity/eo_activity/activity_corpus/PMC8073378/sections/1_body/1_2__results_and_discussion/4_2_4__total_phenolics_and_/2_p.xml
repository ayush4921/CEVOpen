<p>The current study also quantitatively estimated the phenolics and flavonoids contents present in the 
 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic>. Most phenolic compounds were detected in the aqueous-ethanol extract (136.08 ± 0.12 mg/g, GAE, gallic acid equivalent), indicating the high polarity of these compounds. Perhaps the products being multi-hydroxylated and glycosylated in their structural specifications were extracted together with other high-polar molecular entities that are non-reactive to the assay reagent and accounted for their presence in the extract. The phenolics and flavonoids are at 136.08 ± 0.12 mg/g and 3.19 ± 0.03 mg/g of concentrations, respectively of the dry extract per gram of the aqueous-ethanolic extract. The flavonoids quantitatively measured in higher concentration in the ethyl acetate extract (5.94 ± 0.04 mg/g) and chloroform extract (5.38 ± 0.00 mg/g), followed aqueous-ethanolic extract (3.19 ± 0.03 mg/g), and by the lesser concentrations in the 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane extract (1.68 ± 0.01 mg/g), all as QE (quercetin equivalents). The phenolics were detected in the 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane (32.70 ± 0.01 mg/g), chloroform (85.38 ± 0.04 mg/g), ethyl acetate (32.40 ± 0.02 mg/g), and aqueous-ethanolic (136.08 ± 0.12 mg/g) extracts, all as gallic acid equivalents (GAE). Most of the phenolic compounds were detected in the aqueous-ethanolic extract (136.08 ± 0.12 mg/g GAE), indicating the high polarity of these compounds and suggesting that they are structurally multi-hydroxylated and also glycosylated in nature. The phenolic contents were in comparatively lower concentrations in the 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane, chloroform, and ethyl acetate extracts, as compared with the aqueous-ethanolic extract, all being at 32.70 ± 0.01, 85.38 ± 0.04, 32.40 ± 0.02, and 136.08 ± 0.12 mg/g concentrations as GAE, respectively. The flavonoids found in the aqueous-ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic> (3.19 ± 0.03 mg/g QE) are of strong hydrophilic nature. The comparatively higher levels of the flavonoids in the ethyl acetate (5.94 ± 0.04 mg/g QE), and chloroform (5.38 ± 0.00 mg/g QE) extract, indicated the moderate polarity of these flavonoids, and possibly the presence of fewer glycosylated flavonoid structural entities in these extracts than the aqueous-ethanolic extract.
