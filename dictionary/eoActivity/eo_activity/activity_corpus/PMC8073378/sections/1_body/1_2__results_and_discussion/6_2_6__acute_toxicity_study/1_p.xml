<p>The animals, rats, were administered, separately, a single dose of 5000 mg/kg of 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and aqueous-ethanolic extracts of 
 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic> to assess acute toxicity (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5/group). For the initial 3 days, the animals were monitored daily for any visible signs of toxicity. The acute toxicity, including mortality, was recorded for 2 weeks. None of the extracts administered groups displayed any visible signs of toxicity in the first 3 days, while one animal each died on days 8 and 10 for n-hexane, and ethyl acetate extracts groups, respectively. According to the OECD guidelines, the dose is considered toxic if more than one animal dies in any group. According to the Hedge and Sterner scale, the given dose was determined to be practically non-toxic, and one-tenth of the dose was selected for the analgesic and anti-inflammatory bioactivities evaluations [
