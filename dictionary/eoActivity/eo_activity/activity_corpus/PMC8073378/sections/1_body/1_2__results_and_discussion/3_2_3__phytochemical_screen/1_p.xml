<p>Phytochemical screening of the 
 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic> extracts was conducted using qualitative chemical test methods. The results confirmed the presence of phenolics and flavonoids in the chloroform, ethyl acetate, and aqueous-ethanolic extracts. The major presence of flavonoids was detected in the chloroform and ethyl acetate extracts, which indicated that the flavonoids present in these extracts are structurally different from the flavonoids detected in the aqueous-ethanolic extract. The aqueous-ethanolic extract-based flavonoids, in all prospects, contained maximum numbers of free hydroxyls and glycosyl units as part of their structures. These constituents are in lower concentrations, while that is not the case with the chloroform and ethyl acetate extracts, where, considerably, the flavonoids, in most probability, are structurally devoid of the glycoside units, and thus structurally different. These non-glycosidic flavonoid entities are comparatively in higher concentrations in the plant and accumulated in the chloroform extract (

Moreover, the qualitative testing results for the classes of compounds present in the plant also indicated the existence of sterols in the chloroform extract, while aliphatics and the waxy materials were accumulated in the 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane extract.
