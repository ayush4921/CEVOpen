<p>The MDA (M14 melanoma derived epithelial breast cancer cells), MCF-7 (Michigan Cancer Foundation-7, breast cancer cells), PANC-1 (human pancreatic cancer cell line isolated from a pancreatic carcinoma of ductal cell origin), and the normal human fibroblast cell lines were cultured and used in the 
 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic> 95% aqueous-ethanolic extract’s cytotoxicity evaluations to check the anti-cancer properties and the cell toxicity. The concentrations at 400 μg/mL were diluted serially to 6.25 μg/mL, and the cell proliferation was tested. The cells’ vitality was compared with the normal fibroblast cells with doxorubicin as the positive control, and the cell vitality levels for the higher concentration, from 400 to 50 μg/mL, showed moderate to low effects. At concentrations below 50 μg/mL, as observed at 25 μg/mL and 12.5 and 6.25 μg/mL, the cell vitality differences were insignificant for cytotoxicity purposes (
