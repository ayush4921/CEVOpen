<p>The plant 95% aqueous-ethanolic extract yielded flavonoids, phenolics, alkaloids, and sterols as also confirmed by the subsequent qualitative analysis, while the phenolics and flavonoids were quantified as gallic acid and quercetin equivalents for the 
 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic>. These contents are in higher proportions in the 
 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic>. The abundance of flavonoids and phenolics compounds contributed immensely to the plantâ€™s anti-oxidant potential, and perhaps the ensuing better analgesic and anti-inflammatory bioactivities. The LC-MS analysis also endorsed the rich nature of the 
 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic> plant in terms of varying chemical classes of compounds present in it, whereby nearly two-third of all the identified products are flavonoids and phenolics in nature.
