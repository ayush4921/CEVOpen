<p>The obtained results (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02384-f001">Figure 1</xref>) showed that the significant anti-oxidant activity of 
 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic> was compatible with the plant’s halophytic nature, and this fact of higher anti-oxidant activity has also been encountered in other halophytes [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-26-02384" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-26-02384" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. These results revealed that the aqueous-ethanolic extract (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 0.615 ± 0.06 mg/mL) was the best extract in scavenging the DPPH-free radicals. The DPPH radicals scavenging potentials of the aqueous-ethanolic extract and the standard quercetin were approximately 37% and 44%, respectively, at the lowest concentration (0.0312 mg/mL). The ethyl acetate (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 1.354 ± 0.16 mg/mL), chloroform (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 2.395 ± 0.24 mg/mL), and 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 4.958 ± 0.50 mg/mL) extract showed concentration-dependent lesser DPPH-radicals scavenging effects as compared to the aqueous-ethanol extract. This result concurs well with our assessment of the phenolics and flavonoid contents of the extracts, as higher levels of phenolics were found in the aqueous-ethanolic extract, and also together, the combined concentrations of the phenolics and flavonoid contents were at the highest levels in the aqueous-ethanolic extract wherein the constituents possessed strong potentials for DPPH-radicals scavenging activity. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02384-f001">Figure 1</xref>A also exhibited that all the 
 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic> extracts were significantly more effective as DPPH free radical scavengers than the BHA standard, except the 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane extract, which was, comparatively, similar to the BHA and lower than other extracts in the anti-oxidant potentials.
