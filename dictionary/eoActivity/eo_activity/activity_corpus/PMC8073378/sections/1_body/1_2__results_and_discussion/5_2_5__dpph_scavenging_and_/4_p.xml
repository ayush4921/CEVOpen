<p>Pearsonâ€™s analysis demonstrated a positive correlation between the total flavonoid contents in different extracts and their iron-chelating activities (r = 0.98, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). However, no correlation has been observed between the flavonoid contents and the DPPH scavenging effect of the extracts. Additionally, no significant correlations were demonstrated among the phenolics contents of the extracts with DPPH scavenging and iron-chelating effects.
