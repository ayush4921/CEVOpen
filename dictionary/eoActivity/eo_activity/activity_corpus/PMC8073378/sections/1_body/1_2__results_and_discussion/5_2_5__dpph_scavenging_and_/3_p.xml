<p>The iron-chelating activity of the plant extracts containing flavonoids, phenolics, and alkaloids is well established [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-26-02384" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The presence of these contents in the 
 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic> was the most important factor responsible for the ethyl acetate extractâ€™s higher iron-chelating activity, followed by the chloroform extract. The higher chelating activity of the ethyl acetate extract was attributed to the presence of alkaloids and flavonoids in the extract. The alkaloidal constituents have specific sites for iron-chelation as compared to the chloroform extract products, which were devoid of the presence of any significant concentration of the alkaloids. The iron-chelating activity (

 <xref rid="molecules-26-02384-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) of quercetin was highest at 10 mg/mL, followed by the 52% chelation capacity of the ethyl acetate extract, which contained higher concentrations of the flavonoids and alkaloids. The minimum concentration at which the iron-chelating activity was exhibited for all the extracts was slightly over 1.25 mg/mL of the concentrations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02384-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). Moreover, the pure quercetin demonstrated dose-dependent and significantly higher (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) iron-chelating activity as compared to all the 
 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic> extracts. Wherein the ethyl acetate and chloroform extracts, respectively, were more reactive at all the tested concentrations than the other two extracts, i.e., aqueous-ethanol and 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane extracts, and that presumably was supposed to be due to the comparatively higher contents of non-glycosylated flavonoids in the ethyl acetate and chloroform extracts (5.94 and 5.38 mg/g QE, respectively).
