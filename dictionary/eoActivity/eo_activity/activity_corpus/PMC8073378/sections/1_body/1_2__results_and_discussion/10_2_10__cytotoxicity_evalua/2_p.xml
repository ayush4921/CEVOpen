<p>The work reports the verification of the traditionally claimed strong analgesic and anti-inflammatory biological properties of the halophytic plant, 
 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic>, which is also used as salad, emergency food, and animal-feed regularly in the central areas of the Saudi Arabian Desert. The LC-MS analysis confirmed the presence of major phytoconstituents of the phenolics, and flavonoids’ nature. The presence of comparatively higher concentrations of trace elements, as compared to non-halophytic plants, was also recorded. The anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic activities were investigated, and the presence of higher phenolics and flavonoid contents, and the trace elements seemed to be playing a part in the claimed strong pharmacological efficacy of the plant. The aq.-ethanol extract, rich in phenolics and flavonoids, showed comparatively better anti-oxidant, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory properties, followed by the chloroform and ethyl acetate extracts, also forming the rich anti-oxidant base of the plant. The role of phytoconstituents, the potential of quenching the reactive oxygen species through strong anti-oxidant character, and the highly concentrated presence of essential trace elements form the basis of the plant’s claimed health benefits. No significant anti-cancer activity or cytotoxicity was found, and the plant’s safety profile evaluation confirmed the safety of the plant used by the traditional medicinal practitioners. Based on the findings, the plant was found to be safe for human and animal consumptions validated under conditions of the tested dose, its frequency, and period of use.
