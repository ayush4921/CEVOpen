<p>The anti-oxidant activity of other plant extracts and the effects on inflammation has been previously studied in detail. The oxidative damage has been observed to be related to inflammation [

 <xref rid="B48-molecules-26-02384" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. It is also known that increased ROS generation at the inflammation site causes oxidative stress and perhaps consequent tissue injury. The ROS-induced inflammation is detrimental, and if stress is unchecked, it may lead to several pathologies [
