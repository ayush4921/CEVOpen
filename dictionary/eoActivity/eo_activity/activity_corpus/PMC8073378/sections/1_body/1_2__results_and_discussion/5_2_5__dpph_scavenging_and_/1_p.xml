<p>The halophytic plants are exposed to produce anti-oxidant enzymes and secondary metabolites to overcome the oxidative damage of their harsh environment of sandy and saline conditions. Furthermore, the plantsâ€™ anti-oxidant capacity and their products play major roles in their anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities [

 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic> extracts were evaluated for their anti-oxidant activity by two different assay methods. The scavenging activity of the extracts for free radicals was examined against DPPH stable radicals. As the ions potentiate the oxidative degenerations in the body [
