<p>The radicals scavenging activity of each extract was measured calorimetrically using DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) according to the described method [
 <xref rid="B65-molecules-26-02384" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] with little modifications. Briefly, 1.9 mL of serially diluted plant extract, standard quercetin, and butylated hydroxyl anethol (BHA) in ethanol were mixed separately with 0.1 mL DPPH solution (300 µM in ethanol). The mixtures were incubated in the dark at 30 °C for 30 min. The reductions in DPPH color due to the extracts/standard compounds compared to the standard solution of the DPPH alone were measured spectrophotometrically at 517 nm. The scavenging effects of each extract were calculated using the following equation, Equation (1):
