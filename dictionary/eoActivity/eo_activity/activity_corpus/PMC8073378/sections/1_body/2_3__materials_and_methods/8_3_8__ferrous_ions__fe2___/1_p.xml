<p>The abilities of the 
 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic> extracts to chelate ferrous (Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>) ions were determined by the method described in the literature [
 <xref rid="B66-molecules-26-02384" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] with certain modifications. 
 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic> extracts (1 mL, 10–0.312 mg/mL) in methanol were vortexed and incubated for 10 min with 100 µL of ferrous chloride (1 mM) before adding 200 µL of 5 nM ferrozine. The mixtures were incubated for 5 min, and reduction in the violet color of the Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>-complex with ferrozine compared to a blank were determined spectrophotometrically at 562 nm by a UV–Vis spectrophotometer. The chelating activity of each extract was calculated from the following equation, Equation (2):
