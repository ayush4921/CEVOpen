<p>To assess cell viability after incubation with various concentrations of 
 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic> 95% aqueous-ethanolic extract, MTT (3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was used. The MTT assay depends on reducing MTT by mitochondrial dehydrogenase to the blue formazan material, which detects the mitochondria’s normal role and exhibits cell viability. The cells were suspended at a density of 5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/mL in the media. Then 100 μL of each cell type were cultured into each well of 96-wells microtiter plates (5000 cells/well) and incubated for 24 h. The addition of 
 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic> 95% aqueous-ethanolic extract dissolved in DMSO to the wells was completed in triplicate to a final concentration range from 400 to 6.25 μg/mL in 2× serial dilutions and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 24 h. The control wells without plant extracts (cells with DMSO or media) and negative control wells containing only fresh media were also used. The doxorubicin was used as a positive control. The MTT assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 20 μL of PBS containing 5 mg/mL MTT was added to each well of the plate, and then the plates were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C, MTT was carefully withdrawn, and 200 μL of DMSO was added to every well to dissolve the formed crystals. The absorbance at 570 nm and 630 nm read on a plate reader (BioteK Microplate Reader ELX800, Madison, WI, USA) was used. The difference in both the readings was used for the analysis of the results. The surviving cells’ percentage was calculated after normalization using GraphPad prism 6.01 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).
