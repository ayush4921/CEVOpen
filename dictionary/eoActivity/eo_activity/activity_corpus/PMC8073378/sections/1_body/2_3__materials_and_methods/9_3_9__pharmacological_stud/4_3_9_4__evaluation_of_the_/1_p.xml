<p>A total of thirty-six rats were divided randomly into six groups (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6 per group). The vehicle control received olive oil (20 mL/kg per os (p.o.)), and the positive control group of animals received diclofenac sodium (10 mg/kg p.o.). Groups 3–6 received an extract of 
 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic> (
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, or aqueous-ethanolic extracts, respectively; 500 mg/kg/day p.o.) for 1 week. On the last day of dosing, the animals were subjected to a carrageenan-induced rat paw edema assessment described by the winter group [
 <xref rid="B68-molecules-26-02384" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] to examine the plant’s anti-inflammatory potential extracts. Fifteen minutes after administering the doses to all the groups, edema was induced on the rat’s left hind paw by a sub-plantar injection of 0.1 mL carrageenan (1%,

 <italic>v</italic>) and the time was considered as zero hour. Inflammation in the carrageenan-injected foot at a specific mark around the ankle was measured using a plethysmometer at 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and 24 h. The inhibitions of paw inflammations were expressed as paw volume in mL, and percentage inhibition was calculated for the time points 1, 2, 3, 6, and 24 h using the following equation, Equation (3):
