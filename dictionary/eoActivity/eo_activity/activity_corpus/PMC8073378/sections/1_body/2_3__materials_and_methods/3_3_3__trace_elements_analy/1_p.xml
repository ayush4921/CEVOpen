<p>The trace elements analysis was performed on the dried plant powder according to the method described by Jones, Jr. [
 <xref rid="B63-molecules-26-02384" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Fresh plant material, aerial parts, was dried at 70 °C for 48 h and sieved to &lt;0.15 mm (millimeter) and &lt;0.5 mm using a stainless-steel mill. The sifted material (0.5 g) was digested in a mixture containing concentrated HNO
 <sub>3</sub>, HCIO
 <sub>4</sub>, and H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> (7:2:l). The Fe, Mn, Zn, Mg, Cu, Cd, and Pd contents were measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES; Model iCAP 7400 Duo, serial IC 74DC144208; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Shanghai, China). The concentrations of the trace elements in the plant powder were calculated from the calibration curves prepared for each element and calculated as µg per kg of the plant powder.
