<p>The acute toxicity study was conducted according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) procedure for acute toxicity testing [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-26-02384" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. A dose limit of 5000 mg/kg for all the 
 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic> extracts (n-hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and aqueous-ethanolic) was used on 10-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5 per extract). The overnight fasted animals were weighed, and a single oral dose of 5000 mg/kg was administered. The animals were observed for abnormality in behavior and movement for the first 3 days and were under mortality watch for over 2 weeks period [

 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-02384" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The calculated effect size d was 4.30 using a two-tail option on G Power V.3.1.9.4 software, Heinrich Heine University, Düsseldorf, Germany. To achieve a statistical power (1-β err prob) of 80%, and a specific α error probability of 0.05, the minimum required sample size in each group was
