<p>The total phenolics contents of the

 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>, distilled water) was added to 1 mL plant extracts at a concentration of 1 mg/mL in methanol followed by the addition of 2 mL of saturated aqueous sodium carbonate solution. The mixture was vortexed and left at 40 °C in a water bath for 30 min before the UV–Visible (UV–Vis) absorbance was measured at 765 nm using a spectrophotometer (Model V-630; JASCO Co., Tokyo, Japan). The extracts’ total phenolics contents were expressed as mg/g of the dried extract using the gallic acid calibration curve. The results were obtained as an average of three independent measurements.
