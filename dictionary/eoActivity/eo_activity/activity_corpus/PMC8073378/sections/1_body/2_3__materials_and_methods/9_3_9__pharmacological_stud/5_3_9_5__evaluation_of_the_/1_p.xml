<p>A total of thirty-six mice were randomly divided into six groups (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6 per group). The first group of animals served as vehicle control, and received olive oil (20 mL/kg p.o.), while the second group of animals received diclofenac sodium (10 mg/kg p.o.) as a positive control. The groups 3–6 received an extract of 
 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic> (
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, or aqueous-ethanolic, respectively; 500 mg/kg/day p.o.) for 1 week. The analgesic activity of each extract was investigated on the last dosing day using the hot-plate method described by Eddy and Leimbach [
 <xref rid="B69-molecules-26-02384" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] with minor modifications. Each animal was placed individually on the hot plate to observe their response. The analgesic activity evaluation was based on the first reaction time, either paw-licking or jumping on a hot plate set at 55 °C with a cutoff time of 15 s. The time taken in seconds for the forepaw licking or jumping was taken as a latency period and was measured at regular time intervals of 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min (minutes). The percentage inhibition of pain was calculated for time points 30, 60, 90, and 120 min using the following equation, Equation (4):
