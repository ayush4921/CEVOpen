<p>The unknown sample was dissolved in 2.0 mL of DMSO, then completed to 50 mL by acetonitrile addition, and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 2.0 min, 1.0 mL from it was taken and transferred to an autosampler where 3.0 µL was injected. Standards were used for the identification of 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> and retention times of all the contents. The chromatographic separation was performed on 120, C18 reverse-phase column, 100 × 2.1 mm size, 1.8 µm (120 A°) from Bruker Daltonics (Bremen, Germany) at 30 °C, and autosampler temperature of 8.0 °C with a total run time of 35.0 min using a gradient solvent system. For the positive mode, chromatographic analyses were performed using gradient elution with eluent B composed of methanol with 5 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid, and eluent A composed of water-methanol (90:10) with 5 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid. The compounds separations were performed using a gradient elution of B from 0.0 to 0.1 min with 4.0% of B, from 0.1 to 1.0 min with 18.3% of B, from 1.0 to 2.5 min with 50% of B, from 2.5 to 14.0 min with 99.9% of B, from 14.0 to 16 min with 99.9%, and then returning to 4% of B from 16.1 to 20.0 min, 18.3% from 20.1 till last minute. For the negative mode, the chromatographic analyses were performed using gradient elution with eluent B composed of methanol with 5 mM ammonium acetate, and eluent A composed of water/methanol (99:1) with 5 mM ammonium acetate. The compounds separations were performed using a gradient elution of B from 0.0 to 0.1 min with 4.0% of B, from 0.1 to 1.0 min with 18.3% of B, from 1.0 to 2.5 min with 50% of B, from 2.5 to 14.0 min with 99.9% of B, from 14.0 to 16 min with 99.9% of B, and then returning to 4% of B from 16.1 to 20.0 min, and 18.3% from 20.1 till last of the run.
