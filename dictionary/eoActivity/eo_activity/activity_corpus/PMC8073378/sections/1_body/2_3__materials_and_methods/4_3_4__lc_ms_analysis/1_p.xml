<p>All the reagents and solvents, i.e., acetonitrile, methanol, water, and formic acid were HPLC grades. Stock solutions of standard compounds were prepared by dissolving the appropriate amount of materials in analytical grade dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), diluted with acetonitrile, and identifying

 <italic>z</italic> (mass/charge), molecular mass (atomic mass unit), and retention times (in minutes) of all the phytoconstituents. The dried-gel-like 95% aqueous-ethanolic extract (1 mg) was dissolved in 2.0 mL DMSO, then completed to 50 mL by acetonitrile addition, followed by centrifuging at 4000 rpm for 2.0 min, 1.0 mL was taken and transferred to an autosampler, and 3.0 ÂµL was injected.
