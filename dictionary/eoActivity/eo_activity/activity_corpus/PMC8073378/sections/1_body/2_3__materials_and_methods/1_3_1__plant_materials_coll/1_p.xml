<p>The plants were collected from Al-Fuwayliq City in the Qassim region (GPS: 26°33′37.9″ N 42°48′27.1″ E) during October 2018 and were identified as 
 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic> Baker by the institutional taxonomist. A voucher specimen was stored in the Pharmacognosy Laboratory, College of Pharmacy, Qassim University (#79). The plant’s aerial parts were dried in the shade at room temperature (RT) and processed to a coarse powder by a mechanical grinder. The powdered material (1 kg) was extracted (1500 mL × 3) in n-hexane (22.48 g), chloroform (87.60 g), ethyl acetate (112.05 g), and aqueous-ethanol (3:7, water: ethanol) (117.29 g) in sequence at RT by the maceration method. Additionally, 100 g of the plant powder was directly extracted by 95%-aqueous-ethanol to obtain the 95% aqueous-ethanolic extract used for the LC-MS and cytotoxic evaluations of the plant material. The 95% aqueous-ethanolic extract and various other extracts obtained by the sequential extractions of the plant powder were filtrated and dried under vacuum at &lt;40 °C until complete dryness. The dried extracts were stored at −20 °C for further use.
