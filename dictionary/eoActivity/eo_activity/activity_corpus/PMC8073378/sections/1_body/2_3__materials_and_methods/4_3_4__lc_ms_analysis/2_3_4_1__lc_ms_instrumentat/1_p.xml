<p>Bruker Daltonics (Bremen, Germany) Impact II ESI-Q-TOF System equipped with Bruker Daltonics Elute UPLC system (Bremen, Germany) was used for screenings of the compounds. The standards for identifying the 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> with high-resolution Bruker TOF MS and the exact retention times of each analyte were used as obtained during the chromatographic analysis. This instrument was operated using the Ion Source Apollo II ion funnel electrospray source. The capillary voltage was 2500 V, the nebulizer gas was 2.0 bar, and the dry gas (nitrogen) flow rate was 8 L/min with the dry temperature at 200 Â°C. The mass accuracy was &lt;1 ppm; the mass resolution was 50,000 FSR (full sensitivity resolution), and the TOF repetition rate was up to 20 kHz.
