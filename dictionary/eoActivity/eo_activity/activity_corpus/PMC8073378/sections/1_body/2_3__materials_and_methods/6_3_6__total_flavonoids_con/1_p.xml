<p>The extracts’ flavonoid contents were expressed as the total quercetin equivalent (QE) in mg/g for the dried extract and the experiments were performed according to the literature method [
 <xref rid="B64-molecules-26-02384" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. In brief, 1 mL of plant’s (any) extract at a concentration of 1 mg/mL in methanol was mixed with 1 mL aluminum chloride (AlCl
 <sub>3</sub>, 2%, ethanol). The mixture was vortexed and allowed to stand for 1 h at RT, and the UV–Vis absorbance was measured at 440 nm using a UV–Vis spectrophotometer (Model V-630; JASCO Co., Tokyo, Japan). The extracts’ flavonoid contents were calculated from quercetin’s calibration curve as mg/g of QE equivalent. The results were obtained as an average of three independent measurements.
