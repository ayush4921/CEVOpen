<p>One of them written by Rudra et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-25-05769" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] verifies the antidiarrheal effect of various solvent extracts from 
 <italic>Tetrastigma leucostaphylum</italic> in in vivo studies (mouse). This liana (especially its leaves) is used in ethnomedicine of certain ethnic groups in Bangladesh. All tested extracts and particularly dichloromethane extract showed consistent and dose-dependent antidiarrheal efficacy. All extracts exhibited cytotoxicity in in vitro studies. Computational analysis revealed promising binding affinities of the identified constituents (GC-MS) for various receptors. The drug-like behavior of the identified constituents (10 compounds) was tested through ADME/T analysis.
