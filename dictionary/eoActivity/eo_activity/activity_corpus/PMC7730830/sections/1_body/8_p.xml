<p>Rojas-Armas et al. [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-25-05769" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] present the results of in vivo studies (on female rats), which demonstrated the antitumor effect of essential oil from the South-Asian grass species 
 <italic>Cymbopogon citratus</italic> and in parallel also of carvacrol in breast cancer induced experimentally. Both the essential oil and carvacrol had an antitumor effect irrespective of the doses. The authors suggest that it may be citral that is responsible for the antitumor effect of the studied essential oil. In an antioxidant assay (DPPH), carvacral exhibited higher activity than essential oil.
