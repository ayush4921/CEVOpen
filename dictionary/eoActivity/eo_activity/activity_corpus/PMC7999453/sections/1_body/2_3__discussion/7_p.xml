<p>The results obtained revealed that 
 <italic>A. monosperma</italic> and 
 <italic>L. crithmoides</italic> possess a considerable amount of SMs as phenolics, flavonoids, tannins and alkaloids in extracts of their leaves and stems. Some studies reported that the rise of salinity results in an increase in the content of plant polyphenol as in the alkaloids content of 
 <italic>Achillea fragrantissima</italic> and 
 <italic>Solanum nigrum</italic> [

 <italic>Catharanthus roseus</italic>, 
 <italic>Hypericum brasiliense</italic> and 
 <italic>Artemisia annua</italic> [
 <xref rid="B42-plants-10-00481" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Moreover, a noticeable variation in the levels of volatile compounds was recorded in 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> under water-stress conditions [
