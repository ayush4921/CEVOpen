<p>γ-eudesmol as bicyclic sesquiterpenoid alkene alcohol was found in all tissues, and it was generally decreasing. It can display moderate activity against human diseases. α-farnesene as another compound can be effective against the bacteria that cause tooth decay [

 <italic>A. monosperma</italic> and 
 <italic>L. crithmoides</italic> matched with other studies which proved the improvement in the SMs was observed in some EO species in response to salinity as in

In this context, the free volatiles are glycosylated that stored in cell vacuoles and intern rise cellular swelling to reduce the effect of osmotic stress from salinity. Charles and Simon [
