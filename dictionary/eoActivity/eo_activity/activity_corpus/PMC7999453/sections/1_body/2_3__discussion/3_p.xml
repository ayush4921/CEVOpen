<p>Also, the leaves of both studied plants were reduced in size which helps them to avoid excessive transpiration. Microscopy investigation revealed that the leaf surface is covered by a thick cuticle and waxy layer to reduce water loss from the leaf surface which is completely justified by the improved tolerance to extreme moisture [

 <italic>A. monosperma</italic> is isobilateral, which is reported as a prevalent feature of plants growing in arid and hot habitats to decrease leavesâ€™ heating and transpiration requirements [

 <italic>L. crithmoides</italic> leaf is rather cylindrical which protects the stomata that occur in furrows and prevent direct contact to the atmosphere. In 
 <italic>L. crithmoides</italic>, the stomata were very reduced in number and size per area. The mesophyll region consists of compactly arranged chloroplast containing cells; this compact arrangement helps to check transpiration. Also, the palisade cells remain radially elongated to minimize the direct penetration of light [
