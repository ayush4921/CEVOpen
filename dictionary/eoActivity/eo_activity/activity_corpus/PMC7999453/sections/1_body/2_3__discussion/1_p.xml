<p>In this study, the coastal soil supporting the studied plants (
 <italic>A. monosperma</italic> and 
 <italic>L. crithmoides</italic>) was characterized by its alkaline range, sandy to sandy-loamy texture, low moisture content, low water holding capacity, low fertility and high salinity. These results agreed with studies that reported that the Mediterranean regions have different types of soils and featured by a low organic matter content, slightly acidic to alkaline pH and medium to low fertility [
