<p>The results showed that the extracts of 
 <italic>A. monosperma</italic> and 
 <italic>L. crithmoides</italic> include different classes of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and hydrocarbons which exhibited the majority of estimated components. The major classes of essential oils (EOs) in 
 <italic>A. monosperma</italic> extract were oxygenated sesquiterpene and oxygenated monoterpenes, while in 
 <italic>L. crithmoides</italic> the major classes of EOs were oxygenated sesquiterpene and hydrocarbons. In this context, it was reported that sesquiterpenes are an essential category of organic constituents produced by plants and are distinctive of Asteraceae. The majority of these constituents are volatiles which play a role in communication and defense against herbivory [

 <italic>Inula montana</italic> exposed to different abiotic stresses such as drought, large amounts of sesquiterpenes were recorded [

 <italic>A. monosperma</italic> than 
 <italic>L. crithmoides</italic> results in the elevated content of the antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>A. monosperma</italic> compared with 
 <italic>L. crithmoides</italic> [
