 <xref rid="B55-plants-10-00481" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. This could be due to a reduction in the area of the leaves, which leads to increase oil glands and intern an increased amount of oil content under drought stress [

 <xref rid="B58-plants-10-00481" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] revealed that stress might raise the number of glands produced previous to leaf appearance by early divisions in leaves epidermal cells. Drought stress causes both cellular and intercellular oxidative stress. Because SMs have strong antioxidant features, they may be associated with a mechanism to combat the harmful effects of reactive-oxygen species (ROS) [
