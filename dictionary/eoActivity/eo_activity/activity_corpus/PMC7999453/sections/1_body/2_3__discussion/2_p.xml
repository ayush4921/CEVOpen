 <italic>A. monosperma</italic> and 
 <italic>L. crithmoides</italic> plants are featured by their shrubby hard, and woody stems, which aid to resist wind in coastal habitats. The fleshy features of leaves in both studied plants may be due to excessive mucilage to store maximum water, which has a significant role in the dilution of salt concentrations [
