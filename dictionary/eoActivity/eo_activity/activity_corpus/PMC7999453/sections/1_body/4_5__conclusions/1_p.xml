<p>Concerning the ecological field, plant adaption behavior in response to environmental stress (salinity, drought, and low fertility) was evolved in structural and chemical features of plants. 
 <italic>A. monosperma</italic> and 
 <italic>L. crithmoides</italic> from the family Asteraceae showed critical morphological, anatomical, and phytochemical adaptation mechanisms in the Mediterranean coastal habitats of Egypt. As compared with 
 <italic>L. crithmoides</italic>, the high antioxidant capacity of 
 <italic>A. monosperma</italic> may be attributed to their high total phenols, flavonoids, alkaloids and tannins. Three groups of organic essential oils: monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and hydrocarbons were identified in both species. Local adaptation could be assumed as a guideline or indicator for speciesâ€™ survival strategy, and this provides critical insights into the reintroduction or recovery conservation planning of the extremely small populations under the harsh conditions.
