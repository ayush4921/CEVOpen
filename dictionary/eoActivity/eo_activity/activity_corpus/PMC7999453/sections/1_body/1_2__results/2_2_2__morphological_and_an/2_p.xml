<p>The leaf shape of 
 <italic>A. monosperma</italic> is isobilateral while the shape of 
 <italic>L. crithmoides</italic> is cylindrical bifacial (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00481-f001">Figure 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00481-f002">Figure 2</xref>B). The outer walls of the epidermis were covered by a thick wall and cuticle layer in the two studied plants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00481-f001">Figure 1</xref>C and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00481-f002">Figure 2</xref>C). In both plants, the stomata have small guard cells and a well-defined substomatal chamber, but their abundance was higher on the 
 <italic>A. monosperma</italic> leaf. The mesophyll region consists of elongated and compactly arranged palisade cells in both plants where the central region is occupied by thin-walled living spongy parenchyma in 
 <italic>A. monosperma</italic> and loosely arranged spongy parenchyma with intercellular spaces in 
 <italic>L. crithmoides</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00481-f001">Figure 1</xref>D and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00481-f002">Figure 2</xref>D). Phenolic idioblasts were noticed in the epidermal and subepidermal layers which appeared in a black red color in both plants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00481-f001">Figure 1</xref>C and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00481-f002">Figure 2</xref>C). Also, there are many schizogenous and lysigenous ducts within the spongy tissue in both plants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00481-f001">Figure 1</xref>B,D,E,F and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00481-f002">Figure 2</xref>B,E,H, respectively), but the abundance was higher in 
 <italic>A. monosperma</italic>. The epidermal layer of 
 <italic>A. monosperma</italic> was featured by glandular trichomes which were absent in 
 <italic>L. crithmoides</italic> leaf (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00481-f001">Figure 1</xref>E). Calcium oxalate crystals and oil drops were recorded in 
 <italic>L. crithmoides</italic> leaf (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00481-f002">Figure 2</xref>G,F). The vascular bundles were open collateral with hardly distinguishable cambium (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00481-f001">Figure 1</xref>F and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00481-f002">Figure 2</xref>H, respectively).
