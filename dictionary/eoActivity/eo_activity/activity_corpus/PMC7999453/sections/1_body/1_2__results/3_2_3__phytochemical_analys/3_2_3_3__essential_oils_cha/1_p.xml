<p>The chromatograms and structure of the main essential oils (EOs) of

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-10-00481">Supplementary Materials (Figures S1 and S2</xref>). The results displayed that EOs of 
 <italic>A. monosperma</italic> and 
 <italic>L. crithmoides</italic> include 30 compounds for each plant (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00481-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Three groups of organic EOs components (monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and hydrocarbons), in addition to the diterpene group, were recorded in 
 <italic>L. crithmoides</italic>.
