<p>The sesquiterpenes group was the major identified compound of the EOs in 
 <italic>A. monosperma</italic> and 
 <italic>L. crithmoides</italic>, which recorded 48.35% and 64.47%, respectively. Grossly, the identified sesquiterpenes were categorized into (1) oxygenated sesquiterpenes with a percentage of 42.63% and 51.49%, respectively and (2) non-oxygenated sesquiterpenes of 5.72% and 12.98%, respectively. The common oxygenated sesquiterpenes components in the studied plants were γ-eudesmol (14.66% and 8.26%, respectively), viridiflorol (5.62% and 8.15%, respectively), citronellyl iso-valerate (2.76% and 4.09% respectively) as well as a considerable content of hexahydrofarnesyl acetone, (−)-spathulenol, guaiol and (−)-caryophyllene oxide. Concerning non-oxygenated sesquiterpenes compounds, α-curcumene (5.72% and 7.49%, respectively) was the common between 
 <italic>A. monosperma</italic> and 
 <italic>L. crithmoides</italic> and the only non-oxygenated sesquiterpenes compound recorded in 
 <italic>A. monosperma</italic>. While, α-gurjunene, α-selinene, beta-caryophyllene, germacrene D were recorded in 
 <italic>L. crithmoides</italic>.
