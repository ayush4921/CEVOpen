<p>The cross-sections in the stems of 
 <italic>A. monosperma</italic> and 
 <italic>L. crithmoides</italic> showed typical dicot stems with an epidermis of a single layer of compact barrel-shaped cells without intercellular spaces covered with a thick cuticle (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00481-f003">Figure 3</xref>A and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00481-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). The stem shape of 
 <italic>A. monosperma</italic> is wavy, so the cortex consists of the protuberance, which is composed of 5–8 layers of collenchyma, and furrows, which consists of 3–4 layers of chlorenchyma. On the other hand, the stem of 
 <italic>L. crithmoides</italic> is circular in transverse section with the cortical parenchyma zone composed of 4–9 layers of irregular isodiametric parenchymatic cells. Also, the cortex layer is characterised by the presence of schizogenous and lysigenous cavities in 
 <italic>A. monosperma</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00481-f003">Figure 3</xref>A,D) whereas 
 <italic>L. crithmoides</italic> is characterised by abundant schizogenous ducts (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00481-f004">Figure 4</xref>A,B,E). Calcium oxalate of druses and prismatic types were recorded in 
 <italic>A. monosperma</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00481-f003">Figure 3</xref>B,C), and abundant raphids were recorded in 
 <italic>L. crithmoides</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00481-f004">Figure 4</xref>D,E). Phenolic compounds and oil drops near the outer cortical cell of the stem were observed in 
 <italic>A. monosperma</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00481-f003">Figure 3</xref>D) and 
 <italic>L. crithmoides</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00481-f004">Figure 4</xref>D,F,G). Well-developed conductive tissues consist of xylem and phloem in open collateral vascular bundles in both plants. Beneath the endodermis, there is a massive zone of sclerenchymatous polygonal pericycle fibers which form a cap-like structure over the bundles in 
 <italic>A. monosperma</italic> (
