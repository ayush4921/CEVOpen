<p>The soil data in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00481-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> showed that the soil texture of site I of 
 <italic>A. monosperma</italic> was sandy soil, and site II of 
 <italic>L. crithmoides</italic> was sandy-loamy soil. The soil moisture content varied from 3.50% to 4.70%, where the water-holding capacity ranged from 50.30% to 62.86% at the two sites, respectively. Soil pH shifted to a moderately alkaline range and varied from 7.81 to 8.21 at sites I and II, respectively. Electric conductivity was 6180 µS/cm at the site I and 7730 µS/cm at site II, indicating a high salinity. Bicarbonates, chlorides, and calcium carbonates, which reflect the soil salinity status were higher in site II than the site I. The soils of sites I and II were characterized by a low organic matter content (0.90% and 1.40%, respectively).
