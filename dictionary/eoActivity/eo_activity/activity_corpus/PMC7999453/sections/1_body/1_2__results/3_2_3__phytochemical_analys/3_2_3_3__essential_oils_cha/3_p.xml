<p>The second major detected group of EOs was monoterpenes, which are represented in 
 <italic>A. monosperma</italic> with a concentration (34.04%) greatly higher than that recorded in 
 <italic>L. crithmoides</italic> (4.97%). Overall, this group includes oxygenated monoterpenes with a percentage of 21.45% and 3.68%, respectively, where (−)-citronellol (3.01% and 1.01, respectively) was the common compound between the studied plants. Other oxygenated monoterpenes in 
 <italic>A. monosperma</italic> were linalool, (−)-
 <italic>trans</italic>-pinocarveol, pinocarvone, 4-terpineol, (−)-myrtenol, cuminic aldehyde, and bornyl acetate as well as in 
 <italic>L. crithmoides</italic>, benzaldehyde, 4-(1-methylethyl)- and geranyl acetate were detected. Concerning the second group of monoterpenes, monoterpene hydrocarbons of EOs were 12.59% and 1.29% in 
 <italic>A. monosperma</italic> and 
 <italic>L. crithmoides</italic>, respectively. Only 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (1.46% and 1.29%, respectively) was the common between the two plants and the only monoterpene hydrocarbon recorded in 
 <italic>L. crithmoides</italic>. Other monoterpene hydrocarbons in 
 <italic>A. monosperma</italic> were (±)-β-pinene (6.35%), D-limonene (2.09%), α-pinene, and γ-terpinene.
