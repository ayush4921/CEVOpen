<p>Total phenols content was measured by the Folin–Ciocalteu (FC) colorimetric method [
 <xref rid="B64-plants-10-00481" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. In concise, a 5 ml FC reagent (10%) and 4 ml of sodium carbonate were added to one ml of ethanolic plant extract. The absorbance was estimated at 765 nm. The concentration of the phenolics was estimated from the calibration curve as g gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/100 g dry wt. Flavonoids content was estimated by the aluminum chloride colorimetric method [
 <xref rid="B64-plants-10-00481" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Flavonoids were expressed as g catechin (CE)/100 g dry wt. Tannins amount was estimated using the vanillin hydrochloride assay [
 <xref rid="B64-plants-10-00481" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. The standard curve of tannins was set by 0–100 µg of tannic acid (TA). Alkaloids were measured after adding concentrated ammonium hydroxide to the extract until complete precipitation [
