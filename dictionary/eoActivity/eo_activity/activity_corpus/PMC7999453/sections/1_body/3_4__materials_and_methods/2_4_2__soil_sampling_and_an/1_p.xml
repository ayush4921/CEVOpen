<p>A composite soil sample (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5) at a profile of 30 cm was collected from the growth area of the studied plants. Soil analysis was carried out according to Estefan et al. [
 <xref rid="B60-plants-10-00481" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The soil moisture was estimated by subtraction of the oven-dry weight of soil from a known fresh-weight and expressed as a percentage of oven-dry weight. Soil texture was detected by the sieves method. Water holding capacity was measured by using the Hilgardâ€™s pan box. The pH and electric conductivity (EC) of the prepared soil extract (1:5 
 <italic>w/v</italic>) were measured using a multi-parameter meter CONSORT Model 535, handheld. Bicarbonates were estimated through titration against 0.1N HCl with phenolphthalein (ph.ph) indicator. Chlorides content was measured by titration against AgNO
 <sub>3</sub> in the presence of potassium dichromate. Sulfates content was spectrophotometrically valued after adding 0.15% calcium chloride dehydrate. Calcium carbonates were measured after precipitation using 0.5 M HCl, then titration against 0.5 M NaOH in the presence of ph indicator. The organic carbon content was detected by titration with standard FeSO
 <sub>4</sub> after digestion with chromic and sulphuric acids.
