<p>The gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the essential oil from the aerial parts of both species was carried out using an instrument with the following specifications: a TRACE GC Ultra Gas Chromatographs (THERMO Scientific Corp., Waltham, USA), coupled with a THERMO mass spectrometer detector (ISQ Single Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer). The GC-MS system was equipped with a TG-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm film thickness). Analyses were carried out using helium as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min and a split ratio of 1:10 using the following temperature program: 60 °C for 1 min; rising at 3.0 °C/min. to 240 °C and held for 1 min. The injector and detector were held at 240 °C. Diluted samples (1:10 hexane, v/v) of 0.2 μL of the mixtures were always injected. Mass spectra were obtained by electron ionization (EI) at 70 eV, using a spectral range of m/z 40–450. Most of the compounds were identified using the analytical method: mass spectra (authentic chemicals, Wiley spectral library collection and NSIT library).</p>
