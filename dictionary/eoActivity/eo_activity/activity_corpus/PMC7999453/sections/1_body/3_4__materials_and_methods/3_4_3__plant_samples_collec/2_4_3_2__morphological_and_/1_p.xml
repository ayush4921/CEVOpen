 <xref rid="B63-plants-10-00481" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] as follows: the plant specimen was fixed in a solution of formalin, acetic acid and 70% alcohol (10:5:85,

Soft paraffin was melted and poured up to two-thirds of vials for the infiltration process and then left to solidify, and returned to the vials and put in an oven (60 °C) until the solvent evaporated. Then soft paraffin wax, moved to hard melted paraffin wax, then placed in the oven (60–62 °C) for two days. Plant samples were put inside the wax, and a refrigerator was used to achieve complete solidification. The block was then fixed in the microtome which was adjusted to a desired thickness (10–15

The staining process was carried out by removing paraffin wax from the obtained sections by using xylene (20 min.), followed by a mixture of absolute ethanol and xylene (1:1) for 10 min. The dehydration of the sections was done by transmission through a sequence of 95, 70 and 50% ethanol, respectively. The prepared sections were inundated for one min. in stain (fast green), rinsed with water and transmitted to another stain (safranin for 30 min.). The prepared slides were water-washed and dehydrated using ethanol then sections were cleared in three alterations of xylene and placed in Canada balsam. To remove air bubbles, the slides were put in an oven for a week at 30 °C. Finally, the perfect cross-sections were chosen and examined by an automatic light microscope. Sections were photographed at 40×, 100×, and 400× magnification.
