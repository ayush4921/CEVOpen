<p>Globally, salinity and drought reduce the growth and productivity of plants [

 <xref rid="B30-plants-10-00481" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Freshwater scarcity is expected to rise in the future and consequently, the impact of abiotic stresses will increase. Therefore, there is an urgent need to understand the adaptation strategies of plants naturally growing in such stressed habitats. We assumed that both selected species are equipped with a specific adaptation strategy that enables them to survive and persist in these harsh conditions. Thus, this study aimed to assess the morphological, anatomical, and chemical behaviors of 
 <italic>A. monosperma</italic> and 
 <italic>L. crithmoides</italic> in their arid coastal environments along the Mediterranean coast of Egypt.
