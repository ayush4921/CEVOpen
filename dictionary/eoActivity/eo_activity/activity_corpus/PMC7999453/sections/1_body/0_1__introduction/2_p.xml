<p>Egypt’s Mediterranean coastal land is a part of the dry arid climatic areas and is threatened by natural and anthropogenic factors [

 <xref rid="B5-plants-10-00481" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The most significant abiotic stress agents that affect plant communities in the coastal and arid habitat are climatic-induced processes of erosion and deposition, temperature, drought, salinity, substrate instability and nutrient deficiency [

 <xref rid="B6-plants-10-00481" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Biotic stress is induced not only by human impacts but also by other living organisms such as herbivores, weeds (allelopathy and competition) and parasites [

 <xref rid="B7-plants-10-00481" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Consequently, plant species of these habitats acquired different adaptation or avoidance strategies against stressful abiotic and biotic agents. Such strategies include adaptation like modifications of morphological and anatomical structures, plant chemo-strategies, antioxidant activity, etc. [

 <xref rid="B12-plants-10-00481" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Other researches revealed that the elevated levels of salinity result in anatomical modification like leaf thickness, reduction in stomatal number and idioblasts’ appearance [

 <xref rid="B13-plants-10-00481" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. On the other hand, plant chemo-strategies include the production of different secondary metabolites (SMs) from the primary constituents. These SMs are defined as constituents that have no essential function in the maintenance of life processes, but they participate in defensive roles as a response to biotic and abiotic stresses [
