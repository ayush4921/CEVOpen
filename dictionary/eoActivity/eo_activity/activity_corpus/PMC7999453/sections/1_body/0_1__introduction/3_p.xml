<p>Generally, there is little information about tolerance and avoidance mechanisms of psammophytic and halophytic species in arid-coastal regions. In the present study, two Asteraceae species: 
 <italic>Artemisia monosperma</italic> Delile and 
 <italic>Limbarda crithmoides</italic> (L.) Dumort. were selected. The two plant species are among the dominant and poorly-characterized species along the Mediterranean coastal region of Egypt. 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> is a genus of small herbs and shrubs. This genus includes more than 500 species distributed in North America, Europe and Asia [
 <xref rid="B15-plants-10-00481" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Many species of the 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> genus are oil-producing and used for medicinal purposes [
 <xref rid="B16-plants-10-00481" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. 
 <italic>Artemisia monosperma</italic> is a psammophytic shrubby perennial species distributed in the East Mediterranean region and Arabian Peninsula. In Egypt, it grows in desert plains, and inland or coastal wadis within the Mediterranean coastal sector. The medicinal importance of 
 <italic>A. monosperma</italic> is attributed to its anticancer, antimalarial, antispasmodic, antihypertensive and antioxidant activities [

 <xref rid="B19-plants-10-00481" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Also, the insecticidal, larvacidal and antimicrobial properties of 
 <italic>A. monosperma</italic> are due to the bioactive compounds and essential oils (EOs) [

 <xref rid="B22-plants-10-00481" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. On the other hand, 
 <italic>Limbarda crithmoides</italic> (synonymous = 
 <italic>Inula crithmoides</italic> L.) is natively distributed along the wetlands and salt marshes of the Mediterranean Sea and Europe. In Egypt, it is among the common halophytic medicinal species in the deltaic Mediterranean coast. It is frequently consumed by grazing animals. 
 <italic>L. crithmoides</italic> is a perennial halophyte with salt-tolerant features, antioxidant, biological activity, and commonly used in traditional medicine [

 <xref rid="B27-plants-10-00481" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Due to its high iodine and vitamin content, 
 <italic>L. crithmoides</italic> is eaten with vinegar in Lebanon and Spain [
