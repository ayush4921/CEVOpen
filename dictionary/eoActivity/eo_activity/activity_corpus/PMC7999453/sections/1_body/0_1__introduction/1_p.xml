<p>Fluctuation in the structure and function of the ecosystem is generally an output of the interactions between its biotic and abiotic components. These interactions are critical in harsh environmental conditions of coastal and arid lands, so any defect in any component of the ecosystem leads to fundamental changes in others, thus establishing a distinct microhabitat [

These conditions stimulate a zonation of plant communities and high ecological diversity along a gradient from the coastal to inland regions [
