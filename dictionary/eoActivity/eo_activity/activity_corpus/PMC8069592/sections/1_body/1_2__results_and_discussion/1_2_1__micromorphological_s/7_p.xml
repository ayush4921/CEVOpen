<p>Our data concerning differences in peltate trichomes density between the two-leaf epidermis are consistent with those of Karray-Bouraooui et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-02154" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and Rodrigues et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-02154" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], showing a more abundant presence on the leaf abaxial surface. In addition, wild populations of 
 <italic>M. pulegium</italic> growing in Portugal [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-02154" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] showed that the head of peltate trichomes located on reproductive organs were bigger, compared to those of mature leaves, in agreement with our observations. However, these authors reported a number of 12 secretory cells forming the head disc in mature leaves and up to 16 in reproductive organs. Conversely, in plants from Sicily secretory cells consist of up to 18 cells in the peltate trichomes of mature leaves and up to 22 in those of reproductive organs.
