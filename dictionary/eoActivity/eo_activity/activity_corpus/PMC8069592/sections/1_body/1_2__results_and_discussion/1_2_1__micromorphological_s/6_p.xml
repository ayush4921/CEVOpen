<p>The peltate trichomes consist of a basal cell, a short stalk, and a broad head, with a variable number of secretory cells, arranged in two circles. Secretory cells are surmounted by a large subcuticular space containing the bulk of EO, as previously noted in peppermint plants [

 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-02154" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In the wild populations of 
 <italic>M. pulegium</italic> from Sicily examined here, we found a surprisingly high number of secretory cells within peltate trichomes: 4–7 in the inner circle and 8–13 in the outer one, giving rise to 12–18 celled trichomes in the expanded mature leaves (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02154-f004">Figure 4</xref>e), while only a few are present on the outer face of petals (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02154-f004">Figure 4</xref>d–e). In reproductive organs, the number of secretory cells within these trichomes is higher with respect to that found on leaves, reaching up to 20–22 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02154-f004">Figure 4</xref>f). Considering that peltate trichomes only secrete lipophilic substances, being the main sites of EO secretion and that they are mainly abundant on leaves and flower calyx, we calculated their density and head dimension on adaxial and abaxial surfaces of mature leaves and on the calyx. The results are summarized in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02154-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Peltate trichome density is from 3 to 6 folds higher in the leaf abaxial surface (ab.s.) with respect to the adaxial surface (ad.s.). In the flower calyx, a higher density of trichomes is present in MP-II with respect to MP-I. The trichome diameter is always significantly higher in the flower calyx with respect to the leaf. In addition, the head diameter is significantly higher in MP-I leaves with respect to MP-III ones. In conclusion, the trichomes of plants from the different Sicilian sites show few significant differences in dimension and abundance.
