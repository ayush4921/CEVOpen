<p>Few variations in the chemical composition of the EOs could change the potential synergy between compounds and consequently the biological activities. In fact, even if MPLI and MPFI EOs have the same main constituents, their phytotoxic activity was different: MPLI EO was able to inhibit germination of 
 <italic>P. oleracea</italic> seeds at all concentration used, whereas MPFI EO inhibited germination of 
 <italic>R. sativus</italic> at the highest concentration used (100 µg/mL) and germination of 
 <italic>L. sativa</italic> at concentrations of 100 µg/mL and 10 µg/mL (
