<p>For the species from China, the EO yield at the blooming stage was reported to range from 0.7 to 1.4% (w/d.w.), according to data of Rodrigues et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-02154" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], reporting for 
 <italic>M. pulegium</italic> at a full flowering stage has an EO yield of about 1.6% (w./d.w.). On the contrary, the EO yield of the three 
 <italic>M. pulegium</italic> plants from Sicily (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02154-f001">Figure 1</xref>) was higher ranging from 2.7 to 3.2% (v/d.w) for leaves (MPL), and from 2.6 to 2.8% (v/d.w) for flowers (MPF), without significant differences between leaves and flowers (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02154-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The average EO yield fits perfectly within the range previously reported for other 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> spp. (1.0â€“3.9%) by Hussain et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-02154" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], approaching the upper limit and confirming that mint plants, which grow in sunny places, characterized by high temperatures and low water supply, have the highest yield in EO [
