<p>Few studies reported the possible phytotoxic activity of 
 <italic>M. pulegium</italic> EOs. Kimbaris and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-26-02154" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] reported that 
 <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic> was significantly affected by EOs derived from two populations of Grecian 
 <italic>M. pulegium</italic>: one rich in piperitone (96.5%) and another in pulegone (74.4%). In our study, only the EO from MPFIII inhibited the germination of 
 <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic> seeds at 100 Âµg/mL, although piperitone or pulegone are the main constituents in all our samples, this probably because in the previous study authors used higher doses of EOs (0.4 and 0.2 mg/mL). Considering this, our EOs seemed to be more phytotoxic than Grecian 
 <italic>M. pulegium</italic> EOs.
