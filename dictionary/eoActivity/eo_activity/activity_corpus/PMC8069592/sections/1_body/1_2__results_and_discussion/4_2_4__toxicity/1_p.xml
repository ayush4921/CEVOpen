<p>The toxicological test on 
 <italic>Artemia salina</italic> is a useful and rapid screening tool to evaluate the toxicity of the EOs, especially in the perspective of using them as new bio-herbicides. Indeed, through this assay, it is possible to highlight their eco-compatibility by investigating the toxicity on aquatic organisms, which are inevitably interested by the passage of EOs into underground aquifers.
