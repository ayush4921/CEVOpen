<p>The tested EOs at 48 h showed only mild toxicity until 0.1 mg/mL (from 12.5 to 35.0% for the pulegone/isomenthone chemotype). As expected, at the highest concentration tested (1 mg/mL) MPLI and MPFI showed the highest toxicity (95.0%), followed by MPLIII and MPFIII (75.0 and 50.0%, respectively), MPLII and MPFII (~30.0%). This is the first study, which investigates the toxicity of the 
 <italic>M. pulegium</italic> EOs on 
 <italic>Artemia salina</italic> and no data are currently available on the eco-compatibility of these EOs. However, the present results demonstrate once again that there is a direct correlation between pulegone content and toxicity, as already demonstrated in arthropods and mammals [
