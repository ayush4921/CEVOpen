<p>Piperitone was the main constituent in the other four EOs studied (ranging from 80.3 to 89.4%). It is an oxygenated monoterpene similar to pulegone, biologically active against insects [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-26-02154" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] as well as against human and plant pathogen fungi [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-26-02154" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In this study, it seems to have moderate phytotoxic activity. Indeed, no seeds were affected both for germination and radical elongation by MPLII EO (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-02154">Supplementary Materials</xref>), whereas the MPFII EO inhibited, at 100 Âµg/mL, the radical elongation of 
 <italic>L. sativa</italic> and the germination of 
 <italic>R. sativus</italic> (
