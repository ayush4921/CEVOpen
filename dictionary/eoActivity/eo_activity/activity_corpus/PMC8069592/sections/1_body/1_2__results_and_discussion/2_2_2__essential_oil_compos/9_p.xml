<p>Considering this, the salinity and the altitude seem to play a pivotal role. Indeed, as described by Kasrati and co-workers [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-26-02154" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], plants collected from low altitudes, such as MP-I, were subjected to stressful conditions preferring the pathway of pulegone and its derivative isomenthone, whereas higher altitudes lead to the lowest temperatures and humid conditions, in which plants are less stressed, preferring the pathway of piperitone. In addition, it has been demonstrated that salinity specifically increases the pulegone content of

 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-02154" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] corroborating the results obtained in the present study. However, although the altitude certainly represents a discriminating factor, the soil composition seems to exert a predominant role. Indeed, as demonstrated by Rodriguez et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-02154" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], who analyzed 14 EOs of 
 <italic>M. pulegium</italic> coming from different areas of Portugal, even if the plants are sampled at different altitudes and the phytochemical profile of the EOs undergoes variations (decreasing the content of pulegone and isomenthone with respect to the content of piperitone and its derivatives), they always belong to the same chemotype (pulegone/isomenthone). These results confirm what has been observed in the present study: the particular phytochemical profile found in MPLI and MPFI is mainly due to the particular soil features of the sampling site, characterized by very high salinity. On the contrary, the phytochemical profile found in plants II and III is evidently characteristic of the Sicilian territory, which allows for the identification of peculiar and interesting chemotypes of
