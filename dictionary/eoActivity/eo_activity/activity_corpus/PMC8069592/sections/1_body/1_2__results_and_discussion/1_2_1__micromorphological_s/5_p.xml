<p>These trichomes are supported by five to eight epidermal cells, arranged in a circle around the base and forming a pedestal (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02154-f003">Figure 3</xref>a,c, white arrows), and are spread on leaf surfaces and calyx (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02154-f004">Figure 4</xref>). On the petal apex outer face, multicellular uniseriate trichomes appear thin, long, and leaned toward the apex (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02154-f003">Figure 3</xref>d,e). Two types of capitate trichomes were also found: type I with a basal cell, a short stalk cell, and a large, round to oval, one-celled secretory head (indicated by red arrows in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02154-f002">Figure 2</xref>c,f, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02154-f003">Figure 3</xref>a–c, and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02154-f004">Figure 4</xref>a). Capitate type II showed a basal cell, a long stalk cell, and a smaller unicellular secretory head (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02154-f003">Figure 3</xref>b,c, and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02154-f004">Figure 4</xref>b, green arrows). According to data reported by Werker et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-26-02154" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and Ascensão and Pais [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-02154" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], the capitate glandular trichomes of the Lamiaceae have a limited storage capacity, and their secretion mainly consists of a complex mixture of polysaccharidic substances and minor amounts of lipids and proteins. In 
 <italic>M. pulegium</italic> peltate glandular trichomes are spread on leaves, and more abundant on the abaxial epidermis (
