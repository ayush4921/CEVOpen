<p>Also, the density of peltate trichomes in the expanded mature leaves was lower in plants from Portugal compared to those of Sicily. Density data for Portugal plants are 2.7 and 3.9 trichomes/mm
 <sup>2</sup> in the adaxial and abaxial surface, respectively, whereas in our plants from three sites of Sicily these values are 2.6–5.0 and 15.9–21.6 trichomes/mm
 <sup>2</sup> in the adaxial and abaxial surface, respectively (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02154-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Our data are similar to those reported for 7 different species of 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> from China by Yu et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-26-02154" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], where the density of peltate trichomes on the leaf abaxial surface was shown to vary from a minimum of 9.7 in 
 <italic>M. rotundifolia</italic>, to a maximum of 19.9 trichomes/mm
 <sup>2</sup> in 
 <italic>M. piperita</italic>. However, in these species, peltate trichomes had a small number of secretory cells (8–16).
