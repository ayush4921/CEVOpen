<p>Oxygenated monoterpenes resulted in the most abundant class in all the EOs investigated ranging from 92.2 in MPLI to 97.7% in MPFIII followed by other compounds such as esters and ketones in MPLI and MPFI (4.8 and 3.5%, respectively) as well as in MPLIII and MPFIII (4.2 and 1.9%, respectively), and monoterpene hydrocarbons in MPLII and MPFII (2.6 and 4.0â€“44.0%, respectively). Thirty-six compounds were found in MPLI, with isomenthone and pulegone, which represent the most abundant compounds (34.0% and 56.8%, respectively). MPFI showed a phytochemical profile almost superimposable with which one of MPLI (isomenthone 30.9 and pulegone 60.2%) with 34 identified compounds. Fifteen and 29 compounds were identified in MPLII and MPFII EOs, whereas 33 and 9 compounds were found in MPLIII and MPFIII EOs, respectively. The phytochemical profile of these four EOs showed piperitone as the main constituent (88.5 and 88.0% in MPLII and MPFII, respectively; 80.3 and 89.4% in MPLIII and MPFIII, respectively), followed by isomenthone (7.2 and 5.3% for MPLII and MPFII, respectively; 13.0 and 8.0% for MPLIII and MPFIII, respectively).</p>
