<p>In our study, the higher salinity of the clayey-saline depressions where MP-I grows, in comparison with the soil of MP-II and MP-III (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02154-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), does not significantly affect peltate trichomes density, in contrast with observations of Karray-Bouraoui et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-02154" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. These authors, however, studied plants obtained from seeds and grown under controlled conditions, in contrast with the wild growing conditions of our plants. Our data indicate that soil salinity influences the composition of the EO, rather than its yield or the density and distribution of peltate trichomes.
