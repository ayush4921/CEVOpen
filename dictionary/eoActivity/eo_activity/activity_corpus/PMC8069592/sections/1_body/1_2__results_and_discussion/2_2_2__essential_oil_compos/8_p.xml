<p>The main difference between the 
 <italic>M. pulegium</italic> plant from site I and the other two (MP-II and MP-III) is that the first one grew up in clayey-saline sublittoral depressions occasionally affected by winter storms, whereas the MP-II and MP-III grew up in moist clay soils, in sites higher than 300 m a.s.l.
