<p>It is well-known that a small dose (&lt;10 mL) of 
 <italic>M. pulegium</italic> EO can cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and dizziness, whereas a multiorgan failure, which can even lead to death, can occur by the consumption of a larger dose [

 <xref rid="B11-molecules-26-02154" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The compound mainly responsible for the toxic effects of 
 <italic>M. pulegium</italic> is pulegone, which confers to the plant the typical peppermint flavor which, generally, is very abundant in its EO. This compound, once ingested, can act as an enzyme inhibitor and it has a marked organotropism for the kidney and liver [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-26-02154" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Despite no current toxicokinetic studies are available on humans, someone has investigated the effects of pulegone on other mammals. These studies demonstrated that pulegone, once ingested, is broken down by the liver and reacts to form multiple toxic and potentially harmful metabolites such as menthofuran, piperitenone, piperitone, and menthone [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-26-02154" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In vivo studies carried out by the National toxicology program [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-26-02154" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] demonstrated the involvement of pulegone in the onset of urinary bladder disease in female rats and liver cancer in male ones as well as unusual kidney lesions and hyaline glomerulopathy in both female and male rats. However, a recent assessment of the Expert Panel of the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association (FEMA) affirmed the status generally recognized as safe (GRAS) to pennyroyal oil [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-26-02154" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This assumption was supported by the use levels that do not saturate the pathways of metabolism and excretion, as well as by an adequate margin of safety between time exposure and no-observed-adverse-effect levels in animals during short and long-term toxicity studies. Moreover, 
 <italic>M. pulegium</italic> EO did not result in genotoxic or mutagenic effects [
