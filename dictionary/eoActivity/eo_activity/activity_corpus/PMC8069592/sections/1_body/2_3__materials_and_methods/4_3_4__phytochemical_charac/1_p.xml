<p>Phytochemical analyses were carried out by a GC (7890A) equipped with FID and MS detectors (5975C) (Agilent Technologies Santa Clara, CA, USA). Chromatographic separation was carried out using a HP-5MS capillary column (30 mm, 0.25 mm, 0.25 µm) and helium as carrier gas (1 mL/min). EOs injection (1 µl, 10% in CH

For GC-MS analysis, the ionization voltage, the electron multiplier, and the ion source temperature were set at 70 eV, 900 V, and 230 °C, respectively. The following elution program was used: 60° C for 6 min increased to 270 °C at 3 °C/min, and held at 270 °C for 4 min [
