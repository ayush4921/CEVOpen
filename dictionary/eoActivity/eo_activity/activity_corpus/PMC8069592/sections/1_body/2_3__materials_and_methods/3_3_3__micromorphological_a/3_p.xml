<p>For SEM analyses samples of leaves (1.5–2.0 cm
 <sup>2</sup>) and entire flowers were fixed in 70% ethanol-FineFix working solution (Milestone s.r.l., Bergamo, Italy) for 24 h at 4 °C, and then dehydrated through ethanol series: 80, 90, 95, and 100% [

 <sub>2</sub> by a critical point dryer (CPD, K850 2M Strumenti s.r.l., Rome, Italy), mounted on aluminum stubs using glued carbon tabs, and sputter-coated with 10 nm gold. Finally, samples were observed with a Vega3 Tescan LMU SEM (Tescan USA Inc., Cranberry Twp, PA, USA) at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. For the determination of densities of peltate trichomes on both leaf epidermis and calyx, printed micrographs were used, and measures were repeated three times, according to the method reported by Karray-Bouraoui et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-02154" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The diameter of the glandular heads and the number of secretory cells inside the heads were measured for each sample (MP-I, MP-II, and MP-III) in both leaves and flowers, on at least 10 mature peltate trichomes, by computer-assisted image analysis.
