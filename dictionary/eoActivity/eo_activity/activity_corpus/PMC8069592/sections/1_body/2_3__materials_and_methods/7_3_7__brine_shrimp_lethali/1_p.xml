<p>In order to investigate the toxicity of the EOs, brine shrimp (
 <italic>Artemia salina</italic>) bioassay was carried out according to Caputo et al. [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-26-02154" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Brine shrimp’s eggs were purchased by a local pet shop, placed in a hatcher chamber containing artificial seawater, and incubated for 48 h at RT with continuous aeration and illumination. Stock solutions of 
 <italic>M. pulegium</italic> EOs (0.01–1000 µg/mL) and K
 <sub>2</sub>Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub> (50 mg/mL) as a positive control, were prepared in DMSO. After that, 20 µL of each sample/control was seeded in a 24-well plate diluting 1:1000 
 <italic>v/v</italic> in artificial seawater (0.1% DMSO). Ten nauplii per well were added and incubated for 48 h in the same conditions reported above.
