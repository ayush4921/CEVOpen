<p>Surviving larvae without abnormal swimming behavior were counted after 24 h and 48 h by a stereomicroscope (SMZ-171 Series, Motic). Two negative controls (10 larvae treated with artificial seawater containing 0.1% DMSO and 10 larvae treated with artificial seawater only) were also evaluated. Three independent experiments (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10) were carried out for each treatment. Lethality was calculated using the following equation:
