<p>Compounds were identified by calculating their Kovats retention index with respect to the reference n-alkanes C7–C40 mix, matching the mass spectral data with NIST 08 MS library [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-26-02154" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], by comparing the MS fragmentation patterns with literature data [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-26-02154" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], and by co-injection with commercially available standards. Quantification was carried out by extrapolation of the compound’s peak areas from GC-FID profiles.
