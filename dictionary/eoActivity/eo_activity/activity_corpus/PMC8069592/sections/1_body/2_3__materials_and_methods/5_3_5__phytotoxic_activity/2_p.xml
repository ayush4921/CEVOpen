 <italic>L. multiflorum</italic> seeds were purchased from Fratelli Ingegnoli Spa (Milano, Italy), and 
 <italic>P. oleracea</italic> seeds from W. Legutko SRL (Jutrosin, Poland). The seeds were sterilized in 95% ethanol for 15 s and sown in Petri dishes (Ø = 90 mm), on three layers of Whatman filter paper. They were impregnated with 7 mL of deionized water used as first control to verify the germinability of the seeds, 7 mL of water–acetone mixture (99.5:0.5,

 <italic>v</italic>) as second control because EOs were dissolved in this mixture for their lipophilicity, or 7 mL of the tested solution at different doses (100, 10, 1 and 0.1 µg/mL). Controls, carried out with water–acetone mixture alone, showed no appreciable differences in comparison with controls in water alone. The germination conditions were 20 ± 1 °C, with a natural photoperiod. Seed germination was observed in Petri dishes every 24 h. A seed was considered germinated when the protrusion of the root became evident [

Each determination was repeated three times, using Petri dishes containing 10 seeds each. Data are expressed as the mean standard deviation for both germination and radicle elongation.
