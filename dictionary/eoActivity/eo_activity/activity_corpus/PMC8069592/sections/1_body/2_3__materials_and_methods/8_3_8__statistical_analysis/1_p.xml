<p>Results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (S.D.) of three independent experiments (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3 for micromorphological, phytochemical, and phytotoxic analyses and 
 <italic>n</italic> = 10 for brine shrimp lethality assay) and analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) by GraphPad Prism 6.0 (Software Inc, San Diego, CA, USA). Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test was used for phytotoxicity and brine shrimp lethality assays, whereas Tukey’s test was used for processing the phytochemical data. 
 <italic>T</italic>-test with Bonferroni’s correction was used for processing the micromorphological data. Results were considered significant for 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05.
