<p>Alpha-amylase inhibition assay was carried out according to the previous method [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-26-02154" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] with slight modification. Briefly, starch azure (10%) and α-amylase (2 U/mL) were suspended by 0.5 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH = 6.9 containing 0.01 M calcium chloride) and boiled for 10 min. Samples were dissolved in 0.1% of DMSO in order to obtain concentrations of 500, 100, 50, 10, and 1 µg/mL. Each sample concentration, 200 µL of starch solution and 100 µL of α-amylase solution were mixed and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Then, the reaction was terminated by adding 500 μL of acetic acid solution (50%). The reaction mixture was then centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min. The absorbance of the resulting supernatant was measured at 595 nm using a spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific Multiskan GO, Monza, Italy). Acarbose was used as a positive control. The experiments were repeated thrice using the same protocol.
