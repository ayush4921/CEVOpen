 <italic>M. pulegium</italic> EOs showed selective phytotoxic properties associate often with the inhibition of Î±-amylase activity, one of the enzymes involved in the seed growth regulation. However, the piperitone/isomenthone chemotype (MP-II and MP-III) showed the best phytotoxic activity both against the germination and the radical elongation of the crop species investigated in the present study.
