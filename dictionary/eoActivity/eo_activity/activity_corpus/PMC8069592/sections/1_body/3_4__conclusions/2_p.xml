<p>Our micromorphological analyses show few significant differences in dimension and abundance of the trichomes of plants from the different Sicilian sites. The higher salinity of the clayey-saline depressions where MP-I grows, in comparison with the soil of MP-II and MP-III, does not significantly affect peltate trichome density and distribution. Moreover, the complex of morphological and phytochemical data indicate that soil salinity influences the composition of the essential oil, rather than its yield.</p>
