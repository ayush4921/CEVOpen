   <bold>a</bold>), capitate type I trichomes are indicated by red arrows, and capitate type II ones by green arrows; black arrows indicate short unicellular trichomes, yellow arrows indicate long multicellular uniseriate trichomes, while around their base, epidermal cells arranged in a circle to form a pedestal are shown by white arrows. (
   <bold>d</bold>) Long multicellular, uniseriate non-glandular trichomes are visible on the calyx, together with many peltate trichomes arranged in rows between the ribs. (
   <bold>e</bold>) On the outer face of the petal apex, multicellular trichomes appear thin, long, and lean toward the apex, while only a very few peltate trichomes can be found.
