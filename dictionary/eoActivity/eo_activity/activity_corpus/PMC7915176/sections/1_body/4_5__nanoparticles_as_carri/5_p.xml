<p>Similarly, PLGA/PVA nanoparticles (size range from 145–162 nm) were encapsulated with guabiroba extract (GE), a rich source of polyphenols and carotenoids. Release experiments, performed at 37°C and neutral pH, displayed an initial burst effect, more pronounced decreasing the lactide/glycolide ration in the PLGA chain, followed by a slower release rate of carotenoids. Nanoparticles based on PLGA 65:35 released 77% of the enclosed molecules after 6 h, while PLGA 50:50 displayed a marked burst effect (92% after 1 h). This behavior was a consequence of the highest lactide content able to delay the diffusion of the lipophilic carotenoids through the polymeric chains. Nanoparticles showed the growth inhibition of

The same authors improved the synthetic methodologies to achieve polymeric nanoparticles, proposing a modified emulsion-evaporation encapsulation method, allowing the synthesis of delivery devices able to preserve the extract’s phenolic content for a prolonged time during release. In this study, GE showed improved antioxidant efficacy and an interesting MIC value of 2.251 µg/mL for PLGA 65:35 nanoparticles against
