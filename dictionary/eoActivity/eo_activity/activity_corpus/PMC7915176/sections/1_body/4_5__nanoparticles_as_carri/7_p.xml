<p>By using tetra-alkylammonium and pluronic surfactants with different molecular weights, it was possible to easily tune SMN pore sizes to better control loading capacity and cargo release rate. In addition, a relevant concentration of silanol groups on the SMNs surface permitted the preparation of hybrid inorganic/organic nanodevices, mainly through condensation reactions, grafting methodology, or direct incorporation of organic moieties into the silica wall [
