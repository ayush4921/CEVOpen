<p>In the search for new antibacterial materials, silica mesoporous nanoparticles (SMN) have also attracted burgeoning attention due to high surface area, good biodegradability, high biocompatibility, tunable pore/particle size, and easy surface functionalization [

In addition, the presence of a significant porous structure allows designing high-performance devices to be applied as a carrier in the pharmaceutical and biomedical fields. Sol-gel chemistry is the synthetic strategy usually proposed to prepare SMN, mainly involving two reaction steps: (i) synthesis of silica precursor around a template by reactions of hydrolysis and condensation; (ii) removing of the template by solvent extraction and calcination [
 <xref rid="B187-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">187</xref>]. The synthetic strategy deeply determined physicochemical and the morphological properties of the SMNs, such as size, porosity, and surface properties, as well as their cytotoxicity and biocompatibility, which represent important peculiarity to their employment in biological fluids. In this regard, SMNs are hydrolyzed to the nontoxic silicic acid, easily and safely excreted, and/or absorbed by the human body [
