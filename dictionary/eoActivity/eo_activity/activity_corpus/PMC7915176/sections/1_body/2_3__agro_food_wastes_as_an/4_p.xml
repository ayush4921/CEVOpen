<p>Fennel and carrot, two species belonging to the Apiaceae family, are, like many others (e.g., tomatoes, potatoes, and onions), the most commonly consumed vegetables worldwide. They are aromatic and have been used as spices and condiments. Their EO, related to the fruits, is well characterized, whereas the chemical composition of the leaves, a by-product, is poor. Wiem Chiboub and co-workers performed a hydrodistillation of fresh leaves of carrot and Daucus carota subsp. sativus orange roots and yellow roots and 
 <italic>F. vulgare</italic> subsp. vulgare var. azoricum and 
 <italic>F. vulgare</italic> subsp. vulgare var. latina. The recorded results showed that the Daucus carota subsp. sativus yellow roots oil was significantly more effective against Gram-negative than Gram-positive bacteria, and the MIC values were in the range 6.25â€“50 mg/mL [
