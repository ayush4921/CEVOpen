<p>Specifically, in order to obtain polymeric nanofibers able to protect bioactive molecules and to ensure their controlled and site-specific delivery, both synthetic (polyesters, polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), or polyacrylates) and/or natural (polysaccharides or proteins) macromolecular structures have been proposed [
