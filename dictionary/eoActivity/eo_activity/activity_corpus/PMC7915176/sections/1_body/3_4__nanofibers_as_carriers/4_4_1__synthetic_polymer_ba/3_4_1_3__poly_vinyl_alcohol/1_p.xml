<p>Synthetic biodegradable polymers, such as PLA, PLGA, and poly(glycolic acid), are poorly soluble in water. It follows that the production of nanofiber mats often requires the use of organic solvents, incompatible with the preparation of carriers for pharmaceutical and biomedical uses. On the contrary, biocompatible, biodegradable, and no-toxic poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) can be easily employed to prepare nanofibers in aqueous environments [
 <xref rid="B157-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>]. Different natural extracts, as sources of antimicrobial molecules, were enclosed in PVA nanofibers. In particular, 
 <italic>Lawsonia inermis</italic> leaves’ hydroalcoholic (ethanol/water 90/10 
 <italic>v/v</italic>) extracts were loaded to achieve antibacterial nanofibers (2.8% 
 <italic>w/w</italic>) with bacteriostatic action towards 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. and bactericidal efficiency against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B110-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. Similarly, the methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>Tridax procumbens</italic> leaves [
 <xref rid="B111-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>] and the aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>Coptis chinensis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B112-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>] were employed to prepare nanofibrous mats with antimicrobial activity. PVA/
 <italic>Tridax procumbens</italic> nanofibers showed an outstanding zone of inhibitions and improved resistivity power against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, whereas PVA/
 <italic>Coptis chinensis</italic> nanofibers, evaluated against different Gram-positive bacteria, displayed the highest antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>. The ethyl acetate 
 <italic>Rhodomyrtus tomentosa</italic> extract, rich in myricetin and rhodomyrtosone, was involved in the fabrication of electrospun nanofibers; the antimicrobial experiments against the common human pathogens (
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>B. subtilis,</italic> and 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic>) displayed a clear inhibition zone (7–12 mm) by loading the extract in the concentration range of 1.5–2.5% (
 <italic>w/w</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B113-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. Finally, nanofibers containing 
 <italic>Coptidis rhizoma</italic> extracts (10, 20, and 30% 
 <italic>w/w</italic>) were fabricated using PVA as a carrier [
 <xref rid="B114-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. The release experiments performed at physiological pH of 5.5, set by acetate buffer solution, displayed an initial fast release, followed by a gradual release for 48 h. In addition, high antimicrobial activity was recorded against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (max inhibition zone 17.0 mm) and 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> (max inhibition zone 6.2 mm).
