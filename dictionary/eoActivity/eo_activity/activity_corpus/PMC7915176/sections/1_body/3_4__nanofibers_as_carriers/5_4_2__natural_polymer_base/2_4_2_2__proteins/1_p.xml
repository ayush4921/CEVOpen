<p>Gelatin (GL) is a hydrophilic biopolymer, which has been widely used in the biomedical field [
 <xref rid="B173-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>]. Nanofibrous material based on GL was proposed as a carrier of active ingredients gained from natural sources. Specifically, electrospinning of GL in the presence of a small amount of the 
 <italic>Phaeodactylum tricornutuma</italic> extracts provided a device with remarkable antimicrobial properties against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and multidrug-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> [

 <xref rid="B174-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>]. Similarly, 
 <italic>Centella asiatca</italic>, a traditional herbal medicine able to facilitate the wound-repair process, was involved in the fabrication of GL-based nanofibrous mats [

 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli,</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and dermal wound-healing activity in the rat model. More recently, GL fibers loaded with 
 <italic>Curcuma comosa</italic> Roxb. extract displayed antibacterial activities against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (Inhibition zone of 7.77 mm) and 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> (Inhibition zone of 7.73 mm) [

 <italic>Chromolaena odorata</italic> crude extract [
 <xref rid="B136-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>] allowed the fabrication of a system with excellent antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (100% of inhibition). However, nanofibers only based on natural polymers, such as GL, are often not useful for biomedical applications due to their low mechanical strength and high rate of degradation [
 <xref rid="B103-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Baghersad et al., (2018) fabricated hybrid scaffolds, based on GL, PCL, and aloe vera, as an active extract, displaying good antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (inhibition 85.63%) and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (inhibition &gt; 99%) [
