<p>The encapsulation into nanofibers of the EOs gained from natural plants often requires a strong electric field and high-voltage. This could lead to adverse reactions, frequently involving the species able to impart pharmacological and nutraceutical properties to the extracts. To overcome this inconvenience, the employment of the β-cyclodextrin represents an endearing strategy [

 <italic>Litsea cubeba</italic> EO was first encapsulated in the cavity of the β-cyclodextrin, and the inclusion complex was then loaded by electrospinning into nanofibers based on the dandelion polysaccharide [
