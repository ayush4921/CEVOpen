<p>Among polyacrylates, polyacrylonitrile (PAN) has been well documented to be a very important material for easy manufacturing of synthetic fibers with unique thermal and mechanical stability, as well as excellent resistance to the solvents [

 <xref rid="B145-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>]. In the biomedical field, PAN nanofibers loaded with moringa leaf extracts, rich in phytochemicals, such as zeatin, quercetin, amino acids, and phenolic compounds, have been proposed for wound healing applications [

 <xref rid="B146-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>]. The antibacterial properties of the loaded nanofibers were evaluated against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Results displayed that the activity of the device strictly depended on the concentration of the extract in the PNA nanofibers, confirming its promising potential as an effective wound dressing. Alternatively, electrospinning PNA nanofibers loaded with 
 <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic> oil, containing unexplored natural bioactive molecules (eugenol and caryophyllene), were found to be highly effective against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in in vitro delivery studies [

 <xref rid="B147-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. The release profile of 
 <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic> was characterized by an initial burst, followed by controlled diffusion kinetics. Similarly, PNA fibers were loaded with EO of lavender (
 <italic>Lavendula angustifolia</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B94-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. This natural product is largely exploited in aromatherapy as a holistic relaxant and has been exploited for its excellent antimicrobial features. Lavender oil, highly encapsulated in PAN fibers with a loading content equal to 13.6%, displayed a release profile with an initial burst effect, reaching a 35% of active release after 24 h in a buffer medium (pH 7.4). The loaded polymeric device showed also in vitro antibacterial activity after an incubation time of 24 h (MIC equal to 100 mg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>).
