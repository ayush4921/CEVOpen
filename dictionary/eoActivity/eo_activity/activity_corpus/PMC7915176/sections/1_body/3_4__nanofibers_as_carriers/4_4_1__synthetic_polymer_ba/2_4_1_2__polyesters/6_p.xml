<p>Blended polymer-based electrospun nanofibers have gained great attention because of the mechanical properties of the matrices and easy monitoring of the release profiles, depending on the ratio of the components in the polymer chains. By coupling the strength of PCL with polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), PCL/PVP nanofibers containing crude bark extract of 
 <italic>Tecomella undulata</italic> were fabricated, and their antimicrobial behavior was evaluated against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>E.coli,</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> [

 <italic>Nephelium lappaceum</italic> extract, they were decorated with silver nanoparticles [

 <xref rid="B104-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>,

 <italic>P. aeruginosa,</italic> and the results suggested a synergistic effect between silver nanoparticles and extract-loaded nanofibers.
