<p>Alternatively, fibers based on poly(
 <sc>d</sc>,
 <sc>l</sc>-lactide-
 <italic>co</italic>-glycolide) (PLGA) have been successfully proposed as delivery systems due to their high biodegradability. In particular, the electrospinning technique was employed to fabricate ultrafine PLGA fiber mats containing a methanolic extract of 
 <italic>Grewia mollis</italic> (7.5% 
 <italic>w/w</italic>). The antimicrobial effect of the device was tested against pathogenic bacteria, such as 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, suggesting its use in the treatment of dermal bacterial infections or as a wound dressing agent [

Garcia-Orue and coworkers developed a PLGA-based nanofibrous membrane in which the antibacterial properties of the natural extract and the ability of the epidermal growth factor to enhance fibroblast proliferation allowed the fabrication of an efficient device against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>, reducing, at the same time, the wound healing time [
