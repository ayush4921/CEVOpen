 <italic>Sophora flavescens</italic> extract was incorporated into PVP nanofibers, and the device was proposed as antimicrobial air filtration [
 <xref rid="B118-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. Filtration and antimicrobial performances of the PVP-based nanofiber filter were evaluated, employing 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> bioaerosols as test airborne particles; the results displayed excellent antimicrobial activity and highly effective air filters (99.99% filtration efficiency).
