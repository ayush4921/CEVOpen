 <italic>Althea officinalis</italic> extract is also well known as a traditional herbal drug with noteworthy wound healing capacity and antimicrobial properties. In particular, 
 <italic>Althea officinalis</italic> extract was loaded in nanofibers based on PCL and gelatin [

The blending of synthetic and natural macromolecules was proposed as an efficient strategy to optimize the mechanical properties of the scaffolds. In addition, the superior viscoelastic properties of PCL with respect to other polyesters made it more compatible with natural macromolecules, allowing the construction of multilayer structures. Cumulative release experiments highlighted a release of bioactive molecules proximately to 100% after 24 h. Similarly, the PCL layer was deposited onto the gelatin films by electrospinning to obtain complex structures able to vehicle black pepper oleoresin bioactive components. Strong antimicrobial properties of the multilayer were recorded over time (10 days) against
