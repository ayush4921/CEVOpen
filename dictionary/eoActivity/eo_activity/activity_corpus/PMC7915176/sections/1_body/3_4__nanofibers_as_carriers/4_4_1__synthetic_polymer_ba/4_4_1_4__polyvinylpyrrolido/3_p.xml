<p>Nutraceutical properties of the cinnamon EO were exploited by enclosing the oil in the PVP-based nanofibers by oil-in-water emulsion electrospinning, and its antimicrobial properties were recorded against 
 <italic>S. aureus, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, C. albicans</italic> [
 <xref rid="B119-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. The outstanding antimicrobial activity of the device was proved to be related to the size of the fibers and mainly ascribed to the high eugenol concentration in the cinnamon oil. Experimental tests were highlighted as the antimicrobial activity was recorded with cinnamon EO concentration into PVP in the range 2â€“4% (
