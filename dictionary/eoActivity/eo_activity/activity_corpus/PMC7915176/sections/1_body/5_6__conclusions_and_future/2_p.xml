<p>Currently, different studies proposed polymeric nanocarriers as favorable devices to increase bioavailability and activities of natural products, representing a plausible approach for the treatment of a variety of diseases. In particular, the perspectives of a multidisciplinary approach, expecting the combination between nanotechnology-based delivery systems and antimicrobial features from natural extracts, are promising in the infection control in order to produce multi-component devices able to avoid the multidrug-resistance, usually associated with the infections. Nanodevices, such as nanofibers or nanoparticles, were effectively proposed as carriers of extracts from plants, herbals, and agro-food by-products with remarkable antimicrobial properties.</p>
