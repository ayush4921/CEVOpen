<p>In the last few decades, the performance of broiler chickens has shown a continuous improvement in terms of achieving slaughter body weight in a shorter time, with improved feed efficiency. The main reasons for this achievement have been advances in modern broiler genotypes and intensification of management care and welfare. This remarkable improvement has been achieved in the European Union (EU) even after a ban on use of antibiotic growth promoters since 2006. However, the use of anticoccidial substances and ionophores is still permitted in broiler feeds within the EU. It must be noted that a different legislation frame exists in Canada, the USA, and some other parts of the world regarding drug-free broiler chicken production, where use of anticoccidial as well as antibacterial drugs is restricted (
