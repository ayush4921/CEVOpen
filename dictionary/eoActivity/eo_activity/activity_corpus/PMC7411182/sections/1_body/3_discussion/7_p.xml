 <italic>Eimeria</italic> infections have been found to increase the abundance of the genera 
 <italic>Escherichia, Shigella</italic>, and 
 <italic>Klebsiella</italic>, members of the 
 <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> family that have been described as opportunistic pathogens (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). In contrast, it has been reported that parasitic infection decreased the levels of 
 <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, many of which are regarded as beneficial for gut health (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). These results of our study are in agreement with our previous studies, where similar herbal mixtures modified bacterial populations (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>), despite the fact that some 
 <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> species of intestinal bacteria were not influenced substantially by the oregano and garlic feed additives.
