<p>A major target in this study was to test whether the combination of oregano and garlic essential oils possess anticoccidial properties when used as feed ingredients, without the requirement for a withdrawal period and without the detrimental effects that can be associated with anticoccidial drugs. One of the most significant findings of the present study was that supplementation of broilers reared in commercial conditions with a mixture of oils of oregano and garlic reduced oocyst excretion compared with the control treatment at both examined time points (days 28 and 37). It is well-known that the bacterial cell wall is a primary target for the antibacterial effects of phenols. Building on our

It is worth noting that the effectiveness of incorporating plant-based extracts into broiler diets may be variable, and that further complications may arise because of the rich composition of the mixtures of the herbal feed additive, requiring further research.
