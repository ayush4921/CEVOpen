<p>In the last decade, the published literature has shown increased research interest in the use of aromatic plants' bioactive substances in the diets of meat-type animals as an alternative to decrease use of antimicrobial or anticoccidial drugs. Antibiotics have been widely used in veterinary medicine worldwide to treat bacterial animal diseases and to protect the health of farm animals. Important parameters of the use of antibiotics in veterinary medicine include their use, sales, exposure pathways, environmental occurrence, fate, and effects (

Animal waste is commonly used as a fertilizer in many countries, potentially leading to the spread of antimicrobials over large land areas and contributing to a growing global alarm about the adverse effects of antibiotic residues on the environment (

It has been reported that up to 80% of citizens from developed countries still use “traditional” medicine, for example, medicinal plants or their derived substances. Aromatic plants are still under investigation to better comprehend their medicinal properties, benefits, and safety (

Plant extracts from plants such as oregano and garlic contain important bioactive phytochemicals, and many such substances are being shown to possess antimicrobial properties that could be used in therapeutic treatments. Thus, every year many studies are performed all over the globe to prove the efficiency of phytochemicals (
