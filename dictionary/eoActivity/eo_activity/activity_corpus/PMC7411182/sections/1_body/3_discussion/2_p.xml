<p>The results showed that both oregano and garlic possess very strong anticoccidial activity 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, evidenced by the inhibition of sporozoite invasion at the higher concentrations tested, potentially caused by a toxic effect that left few parasites fit to invade cells. Oregano essential oil exhibited an effect comparable with robenidine, a well-known anticoccidiostat. The same high essential oil concentration did not show any deleterious effects on the host cells based upon a microscopic assessment of cell morphology within the monolayer. Cytotoxic effects on the host cells could have affected parasite invasion and proliferation (

Further studies to evaluate the effects of both essential oils in this part of the eimerian lifecycle, and the extent to which pre-treatment of free sporozoites has an effect, would be of great interest. Although the mode(s) of action or mechanisms involved have not been elucidated, a reasonable explanation for this anticoccidial activity is the hydrophobic character and low molecular weight of the main phenolic compounds present in those essential oils that allow them to disintegrate outer cell membranes (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). This may cause an increase in cytoplasmic membrane permeability and lead to cell death caused by leakage of ions, energy loss, and diffusion of cell contents (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Further, the high lipid solubility of oregano and garlic essential oils is likely to permit rapid diffusion through parasite and host cell membranes. Other possible mechanisms include interference with the calcium-mediated signaling that is a necessary mechanism for invasion by 
 <italic>E. tenella</italic> sporozoites (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). The hydrophobic character of those compounds may suggest interaction with membrane components and permeability (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). If the carvacrol concentration increases, then more molecules interact with the phospholipid bilayer, upsetting membrane fluidity (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Accordingly, carvacrol, thymol, and allicin, the major bioactive ingredients of the mixture tested here, may also exert a toxic effect on the upper layer of mature enterocytes of the intestinal mucosa. For this reason, we also assessed their cytotoxic effect 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and found it to be very low. Moreover, other studies have demonstrated that MDBK cells are able to produce cytokines when stimulated by exposure to viruses, suggesting that an immune response could also be involved in the anticoccidial effect of these metabolite compounds of oregano and garlic (
