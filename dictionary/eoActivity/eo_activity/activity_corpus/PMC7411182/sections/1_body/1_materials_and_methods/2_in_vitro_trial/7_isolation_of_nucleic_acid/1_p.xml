<p>Genomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated using a DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen), according to company instructions. The DNA was eluted in a final volume of 165 μl per sample. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed in a CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hertfordshire, UK) according to Marugan-Hernandez et al. (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Briefly, the quantification of 
 <italic>E. tenella</italic> genomes per sample used gDNA and primers specific for the 
 <italic>Eimeria</italic> genus 5S rDNA (Fw_5S: TCATCACCCAAAGGGATT and Rv_5S: TTCATACTGCGTCTAATGCAC) (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Each qPCR plate used a mix of 19 μl/well (10 μl of Ssofast Eva Green, 0.5 μl of each 5S primer (10 μM), and 8.5 μl of water) and 1 μl of DNA. Serial dilutions of sporozoite gDNA equivalent to 1 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> to 1 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> genomes were included to produce a standard curve for genome quantification. All groups and the standard curve were evaluated testing three technical replicates per sample.
