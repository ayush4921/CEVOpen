<p>All data were analyzed using Bio-Rad CFX Manager software (Bio-Rad). The quantification of number of parasites was performed considering the standard deviation (SD) of Cq values, excluding SD &gt;0.05. The average of values Starting Quantity (SQ) per sample was used to plot graphics seen in results. Statistical analysis was done by GraphPad (GraphPad Prism 8, California, USA). The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to access data normality. Differences and comparisons among groups were performed by one-way ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by Dunnettâ€˜s multiple comparisons test.</p>
