<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, parasite invasion and replication was not notably influenced by pre-treatment with the lowest doses of either essential oil, but almost no intracellular sporozoites were found when the highest doses were used. MDBK morphology was not affected by either treatment, even at higher levels of exposure. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> evaluation of sporozoite invasion in MDBK cells after treatments showed differences among groups testing both oils at 2 HPI (one-way ANOVA test, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Oregano essential oil at 100 μg/ml significantly inhibited sporozoite invasion (as much as robenidine control inhibition) when compared with DMSO (Dunnett's multiple comparisons test, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Lower concentrations of oregano essential oil (50, 10, and 5 μg/ml) also exhibited an effect on sporozoite invasion; however, the difference was not significant when compared with the DMSO control (Dunnett's multiple comparisons test, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). In a similar way, inhibition of invasion at 24 HPI using oregano was only significant for sporozoites pre-treated with 100 μg/ml (Dunnett‘s multiple comparisons test, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). The effect of garlic essential oil at 2 HPI was less intense than oregano (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), but significant inhibition was still observed compared with DMSO control when 20 μg/ml was used during sporozoite pre-incubation (Dunnett's multiple comparisons test, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Nonetheless, by 24 HPI, variation in sporozoite inhibition became statistically significant when 50 or 100 μg/ml was used for pre-incubation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>).
