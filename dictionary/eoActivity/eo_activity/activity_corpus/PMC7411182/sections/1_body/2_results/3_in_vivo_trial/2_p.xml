 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, the effects of essential oil supplementation on the examined intestinal microflora populations are presented. In the caeca, total anaerobes were found to be lower (

 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.10) were noted for the other examined populations (total aerobes, 
 <italic>E. coli, Enterobacteriaceae, Lactobacillus, C. perfringens</italic>). In the jejunum, the ORE-GAR treatment group presented higher counts of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.01), 
 <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), and lower counts of 
 <italic>C. perfringens</italic> (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) compared with the CONTROL treatment, but no differences were noted for the other examined populations (total aerobes, total anaerobes,
