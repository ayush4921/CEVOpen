<p>It is certainly necessary to take into account the safety of excipients used in paediatric products, as the toxicity of these excipients may differ from that of adults [

Under this assumption, it is essential to develop methodologies that provide an integrated assessment of exposure to potentially toxic excipients contained in medicines. Therefore, in 2007, members of pharmaceutical industries, hospitals and academics interested in improving drug formulations in paediatrics founded the European Paediatric Formulation Initiative (EUPFI). The latter sought to address safety problems linked to excipients used in children [
