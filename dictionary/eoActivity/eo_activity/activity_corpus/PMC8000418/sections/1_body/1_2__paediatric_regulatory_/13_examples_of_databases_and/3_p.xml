<p>The scientific literature shows that excipients commonly used in adult medicines have been associated with high toxicological risks and safety problems in children [
 <xref rid="B20-pharmaceutics-13-00387" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Following the United States Paediatric Formulation Initiative (USPFI) and Global Paediatric Research (GRIP), the Paediatric Excipient Safety and Toxicity Database (STEP) was created to address the need for effortless access to information about the excipientsâ€™ safety and toxicity [

The STEP database is presented as a resource of information to facilitate access to data on the use and acceptability of excipients in children, thus allowing a rapid evaluation of the risks due to the use of certain excipients in the paediatric population and an improvement in the scientific decision making [

Furthermore, the STEP database provides comprehensive and comparative information on the safe use and acceptability of excipients in paediatrics. For the reasons listed above, the STEP database stands out with respect to other existing public resources (such as TOXNET) or databases (such as Vitic or ACToR) that organize their informational content in free text format, thus preventing data from being filtered as needed (see
