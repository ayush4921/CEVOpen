<p>In general, there is little information regarding excipients in paediatrics. It is of the utmost importance to develop new research related to the safety and toxicity of excipients to reduce the prevalence of adverse effects in paediatric populations. Gallon formulators can formulate safer, more stable and higher quality products. Furthermore, the possible adverse effects of the active ingredients and the excipients used in the paediatric population should be reconsidered—since excipients that are safe in adults—may have potentially toxic effects in children.</p>
