<p>European new-borns receive several potentially harmful pharmaceutical excipients: parabens, polysorbate 80, propylene glycol, benzoates, sodium saccharine, sorbitol, ethanol and benzalkonium chloride. According to the study conducted by Nellis and collaborators [
 <xref rid="B36-pharmaceutics-13-00387" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], there are regional variations in the neonatal administration of these potentially harmful excipients. This suggests the possibility of reducing exposure to parabens, polysorbate 80, propylene glycol and sodium saccharine by replacing it with products without these excipients. However, a joint effort by the regulatory authorities on medicines, in particular the paediatric committees, will be necessary. Current therapeutic options for the paediatric population justify further toxicokinetic and drug safety studies so that they are tailored to the special needs of the paediatric population.
