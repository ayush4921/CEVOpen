<p>This theoretical studyâ€™s main objective is to critically review the use of excipients in paediatrics with an emphasis on the issue of safety, mainly on the basis of toxicological studies. This will enable information to be obtained that will allow decisions to be made regarding the masterful preparation of formulations. This study also seeks to investigate the development of databases and initiatives in order to record corroborated information on excipients for paediatric use, thus serving as a guide for clinical professionals. </p>
