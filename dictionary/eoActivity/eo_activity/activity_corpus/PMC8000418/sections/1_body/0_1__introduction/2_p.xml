<p>The process of formulating excipients in paediatrics is a complicated task that requires various considerations to be accounted for in order to for them to be appropriate; variables such as an acceptable taste, age, dosage forms, among others, must be taken into account when selecting safe excipients. Furthermore, childrenâ€™s rapid growth and development are associated with changes in various organs, body composition, protein bonds, active transport mechanisms and metabolic pathways, which must also be taken into account [
