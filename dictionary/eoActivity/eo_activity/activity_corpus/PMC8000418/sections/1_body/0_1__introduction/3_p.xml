<p>It is thus of particular relevance to carry out an assessment of the safety of excipients prior to their use in paediatrics. Indeed, Georg Schmitt [
 <xref rid="B3-pharmaceutics-13-00387" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] advocates for non-clinical safety studies being carried out in juvenile animals to assess excipient toxicity or sensibility and also to establish safe exposures in paediatric age groups. He specifically recommends that excipient toxicity studies also be carried out, as they provide a detailed assessment of clinical risk. He further suggests that even excipients with significant toxic potential for children may be acceptable after a rigorous assessment of the risk they pose is made. Another factor to be considered for toxicological studies is the extent to which the target disease may be alleviated by the formulation of that medicine. Thus, pharmaceutical companies should filter the demands for safety assessments by selecting those that will contribute to a potential therapeutic benefit, while helping to develop a reference list of excipients generally considered safe for use in paediatric formulations. In this way, the clinical decision-making process will be made easier.
