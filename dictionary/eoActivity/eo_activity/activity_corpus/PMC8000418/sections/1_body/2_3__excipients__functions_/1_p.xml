<p>Paediatric formulations need excipients to maintain their quality and promote the acceptability of childhood patients [

 <xref rid="B27-pharmaceutics-13-00387" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] confirms that many of the medicines used in paediatrics contain some toxic or potentially toxic excipient for the paediatric population, with this data being present in two-thirds of new-borns in 21 European countries. Thus, excipients used in paediatric formulations require a thorough assessment of short-term and long-term safety prior to their use in these formulations [
 <xref rid="B28-pharmaceutics-13-00387" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. A classification of the main excipients will then be developed according to the role they play in the formulation, mentioning the possible adverse effects on the paediatric population. Furthermore, a summary appendix (
