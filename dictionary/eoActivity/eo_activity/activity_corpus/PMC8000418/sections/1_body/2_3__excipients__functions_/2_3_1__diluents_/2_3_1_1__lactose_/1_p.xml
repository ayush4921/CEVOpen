<p>Lactose, which is a mandatory excipient, is recommended not to be used in patients with lactose intolerance and is contraindicated in patients with galactosemia [
 <xref rid="B1-pharmaceutics-13-00387" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It may cause hypersensitivity reactions in children and new-borns. Infants with lactose intolerance do not properly metabolize lactose, due to the deficiency of the enzyme lactase, thus causing the accumulation of lactic acid, hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Symptoms such as severe abdominal pain, flatulence, bloating or swelling and diarrhoea may, therefore, appear, as well as systemic symptoms such as muscle, joint pain and eczema [
 <xref rid="B28-pharmaceutics-13-00387" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. It should be noted that children may sometimes have very severe and prolonged reactions to lactose that can lead to additional complications, such as dehydration, bacterial proliferation and metabolic acidosis [
