 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app3-pharmaceutics-13-00387">Appendix C</xref>, there is a summary table (
 <xref rid="pharmaceutics-13-00387-t0A2" ref-type="table">Table A2</xref>) of examples of solid and semi-solid medicines used in the paediatric population, marketed in Spain. Additionally, a list of excipients and relevant characteristics of the pharmaceutical form (PF) is shown (performed consultation of CIMA database, September 2020). It clearly shows that the reason such excipients are not recommended for the paediatric population is because of the adverse effects they may cause, which include: 
 <list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <p>Approximately 100% of the formulations shown here carry at least one excipient not recommended for the paediatric population.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Benzalkonium chloride, methyl para hydroxybenzoate and propyl para hydroxybenzoate are some of the most commonly used preservatives in solid and semi-solid formulations for paediatric use, even though they are considered to be potentially toxic in neonates.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Sucrose, aspartame and mannitol are used as sweetener. 100% of the oral solid formulations collected in 
    <xref rid="pharmaceutics-13-00387-t0A4" ref-type="table">Table A4</xref> carry at least one excipient of these: 40% of formulations carry mannitol and aspartame; 20% carry the 3 excipients; 20% sucrose and aspartame and the remaining 20% only sucrose.

   <p>Propylene glycol is another excipient commonly used in solid formulations as a solvent, moisturizer and preservative. Caution should be exercised in children under 4 years of age and neonates, as propylene glycols, at high doses, may cause alterations in the Central Nervous System, in addition to other side effects discussed in the previous sections of this paper.</p>

   <p>Microcrystalline cellulose, methylcellulose and ethyl cellulose are one of the most commonly used excipients in solid formulations. They have no major side effects, but in high amounts they can cause a laxative effect.</p>

  <list-item>
   <p>Most of the solid formulations collected in 
    <xref rid="pharmaceutics-13-00387-t0A2" ref-type="table">Table A2</xref> use flavourings such as grape essence, lemon flavouring, caramel cream aroma or orange essence, in order to achieve a better palatability. The main drawback of their incorporation into paediatric formulations is that they usually have a complex and poorly known composition [

   <p>Lanolin is an excipient used in pastes and ointments, which are frequently used in the paediatric population. This excipient may cause skin hypersensitivity reactions, which is why caution should be exercised in patients with known sensitivity issues [
