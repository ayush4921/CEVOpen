<p>In adults, it is metabolized to benzoic acid, which is conjugated in the liver with glycine. As a result, the acid hippuric formed is excreted in urine. However, in new-borns, this conversion of the benzoic acid into hippuric acid is very diminished, because of the lack of liver maturation. That justifies fatal intoxication cases in new-borns who had their umbilical catheters cleaned with benzoic acid. Consequently, cases of metabolic acidosis and respiratory depression occurred. Additionally, other adverse effects have been described, like intraventricular bleeding, cerebral palsy and developmental delay. In some cases, there have been reactions of hypersensitivity, allergy and contact dermatitis [
