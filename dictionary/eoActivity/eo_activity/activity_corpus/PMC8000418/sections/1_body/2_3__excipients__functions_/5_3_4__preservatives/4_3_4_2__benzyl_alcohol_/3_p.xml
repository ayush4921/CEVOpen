<p>In the 1990s, Svinning and collaborators [
 <xref rid="B42-pharmaceutics-13-00387" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] conducted a review of the medical records of babies who weighed less than 1250 g at birth and were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. The main objective of this study was to assess the impact of the toxicity of benzyl alcohol, following discontinuation of the use of solutions to wash intravascular catheters containing benzyl alcohol. A significant decrease in mortality rate and incidence of Grade III/IV intraventricular haemorrhage was observed among infants weighing less than 1000 g at birth who were not exposed to benzyl alcohol (as opposed to those who were).
