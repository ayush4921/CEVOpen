Accordingly, “patient-specific” or “tailor-made” dosage concepts could be an alternative to mass production in the traditional pharmaceutical industry. In this approach, 3D printing has proven to be a manufacturing technique with great potential, as it allows the creation of three-dimensional objects, layer by layer, with total freedom of form and design. Thus, obtaining customized pharmaceutical forms is one of the main objectives of 3D printing in the pharmaceutical sector [
