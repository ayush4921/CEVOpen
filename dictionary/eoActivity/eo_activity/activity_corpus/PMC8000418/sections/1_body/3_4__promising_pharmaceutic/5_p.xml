<p>The SeDeM-ODT model (based on the SeDeM expert system) indicates the ability of a powder to be compressed, providing the Good Compressibility and oral dispersibility Index (IGCB). This index is composed of six main factors which indicate whether a powder mixture has the ability to be compressed by direct compression. Furthermore, it indicates whether the tablets are suitable for formulation as oral dispersible tablets. Thus, the SeDeM-ODT model facilitates the selection of excipients with the appropriate properties to produce ODT tablets using direct compression technologies [
