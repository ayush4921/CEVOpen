    <list-item>
     <p>Improve prospects of identifying potential security issues in the early stages of the development process when excipients are selected. </p>

    <list-item>
     <p>Help highlight any relationships between exposure and evidence of clinically significant toxicity in the paediatric age group in general, or in paediatric subpopulations. </p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
     <p>Identify possible differences in expression, types or patterns of toxicity in children compared to adults. Provide a basis for assessing the need to generate new data for paediatric medicines (e.g., bridge studies, juvenile toxicity studies, etc.), in order to clarify what kind of new data, knowledge gaps or studies may be needed. </p>

    <list-item>
     <p>Support companies with their regulatory presentations with easily available information. </p>
