<p>and 437â€“508 as receptor binding motif (RBM), which binds to the ACE2 receptor. Other earlier studies have also compared the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike protein of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 having high residue conservation, indicating that only a small change makes the SARS-CoV-2 binding to the ACE2 receptor different from the other coronaviruses (

 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Thus, targeting these sites could be an efficient mode for combating SARS-CoV2 infections.
