<p>Ethnomedicinal literature claims the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of diverse medicinal plant extracts and phytocompounds, as the majority of those antiviral herbs contain flavones, polyphenols, and alkaloids. Due to the rapid emergence of new highly infectious viruses as well as re-emergence of drug-resistance, and difficult-to-treat infections along with the concurrent availability of advanced technological tools, the exploration of antiviral activity of medicinal plants has acquired momentum. In the current scenario of COVID-19, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) was included in the guideline for the treatment, which claimed to be efficacious in several cases (

Thus, in this study we have performed a meticulous analysis of documented antiviral properties of selected traditionally used Indian medicinal plants. This resulted in eight potential plants to be probed for phytochemical moieties that could target COVID-19 effectively. The rationale on selection of plants is discussed in detail as follows.
