<p>The S1 and S2 domains are present in individual monomers of the spike protein trimer (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>).This 3D structure of protein complex has been recently elucidated using Cryo-Electron microscopy (PDB id: 6VSB) (rendered using PyMol) (

 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The surface unit 1 (S1) helps in the strong attachment of the spike protein to human cell receptors. The cleavage of S1/S2 helps in the entry of viral particles and the fusion of the viral capsid with the host cell membrane is guided by the S2 subunit (
