<p>The RBD of Spike protein is one of the major targets in the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 and is the most sought-after target being worked out across the globe. Some of the key residues which are involved in the entry and infection of the SARS-CoV-2 harbors on the RBD of the spike protein. Recently, glycosylation sites are also suggested to hold a key role in viral proliferation, as inferred by mutagenesis studies. Hence, in this study, virtual screening of phytochemical inhibitors targeting RBD domain was carried out, with a key emphasis on ACE2 binding residues along with glycosylation sites. Among the compounds studied, 
 <italic>Tellimagrandin-II</italic> from 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> and 
 <italic>O-Demethyl-demethoxycurcumin</italic> from 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> were found to show stable interactions with key hotspot residues (ACE2 binding) including the glycosylation site. Molecular dynamics simulation of these compounds in complex with RBD also showed higher stability due to intermolecular interactions with active residues, significant binding free energy and optimal shape complementary during the entire production run. The results from this study clearly indicates that the proposed compounds may be considered as potential candidates for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as these are dual-acting in terms of inhibiting ACE2 interactions, as well as targeting the glycosylation of spike protein. However, further experimental validations are warranted to infer the therapeutic efficacy.
