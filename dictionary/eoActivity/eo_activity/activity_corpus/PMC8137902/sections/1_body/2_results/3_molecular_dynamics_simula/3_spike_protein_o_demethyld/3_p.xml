<p>Protein-Ligand contact analysis inferred that CYS336 to form hydrogen-bonded interactions for around 80% of the duration, followed by PHE338, which showed 60% of time to interaction by means of hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions. PHE342, ASP364, VAL367, and TRP436 showed around 50% of the time with interaction fraction which includes hydrophobic and water-bridge interactions (
