<p>In pursuit of finding an important candidate for managing COVID-19 from selected plants, molecular docking studies were carried out with phytochemicals listed from eight plants on the binding pocket of COVID-19 spike glycoprotein (PDB ID: 7BZ5). Based on literature review, it was clearly found that the virus enters the human cell via the ACE2 receptor. Hence, we prioritized the receptor binding domain of spike glycoprotein PDB ID: 7BZ5, wherein the spike protein interacts with ACE2 for docking studies. The geometry optimized compounds from all the plants were docked against active-cavity as discussed above, and were ranked based on their corresponding docking score. Compounds having the docking score of &lt; -7.0 kcal/mol were considered for further evaluation. This cut-off was adopted, based on earlier studies, wherein it was found to be optimal (
