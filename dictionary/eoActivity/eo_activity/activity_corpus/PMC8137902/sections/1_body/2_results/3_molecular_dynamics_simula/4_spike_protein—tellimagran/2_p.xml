<p>The mobility of the compound in the complex during simulation with residue-wise calculation was visualized as (root mean square fluctuation) RMSF plot. On further analysis, the plot inferred a minimum fluctuation in the ligand bound position ~1 Å. Moreover, the trajectory remained stable throughout the simulation with a maximal deviation of ~2.5 Å (

Protein-Ligand contact analysis for the simulation period of 50 ns inferred that GLU340 and ASP364 to show hydrogen bonded and water-bridge interaction fraction for around 100% of the duration, with interactions at more than one position. ASN343 showed interactions around 60% of the simulation run, which mainly includes hydrogen bonds and water bridges. VAL367 showed interactions around 100% of the time includes Hydrogen bonds, Hydrophobic, and water-bridge interactions (
