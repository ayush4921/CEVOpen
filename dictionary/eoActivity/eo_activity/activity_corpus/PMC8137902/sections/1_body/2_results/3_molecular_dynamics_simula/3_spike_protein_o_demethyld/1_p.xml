<p>The simulation system of Spike protein O-Demethyl-demethoxycurcumin consisted of 25,902 atoms with 7,659 water molecules. To further neutralize the system, 3 Cl
 <sup>−</sup> (7.122 mM) were added and the system was subjected to 50 ns run of production run. The RMSD plot showed a convergence at 10 ns with ~1.5 Å difference in the ligand bound state (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>). The Ligand RMSD values remained within the range of 1.0–2.5 Å with average RMSD value being 1.75 Å (
