 <italic>O. tenuiflorum</italic>, Stigmastanol (−7.7 kcal/mol) showed interactions with surrounding residues of active cavity and (+)-Taxifolin (−7.0 kcal/mol) formed hydrogen bonded interaction with ASN343, while other compounds showed interactions only with other residues proximal to active residues and showed higher binding affinity. Among these compounds, Caryophyllene featured the highest binding affinity with a score of −8.1 kcal/mol (
