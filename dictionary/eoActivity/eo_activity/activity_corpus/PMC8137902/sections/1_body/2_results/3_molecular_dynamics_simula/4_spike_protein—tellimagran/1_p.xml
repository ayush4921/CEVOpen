<p>The simulation system of Spike protein Tellimagrandin-II complex comprised of 25,917 atoms with 7,645 water molecules. To further neutralize the system, 3 Cl
 <sup>−</sup> (7.135 mM) were added. The system was subjected to a 50 ns run of the production run. The RMSD plot for this complex showed convergence at 10 ns with ~1 Å (admissible range) of deviation in intermolecular interactions during the entire production run (
