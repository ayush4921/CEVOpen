<p>The mobility of the compound in the complex during simulation with residue-wise calculations was plotted as RMSF trajectory. The analysis of the RMSF plot inferred that there was a minimum fluctuation around ~1 Å, and the trajectory to remain stable throughout the simulation with maximum deviation of~2.4 Å (
