<p>The compound Rutaecarpine from 
 <italic>T. indica</italic> was found to be interacting with spike protein at SER371 and SER373 with a binding affinity of −7.9 kcal/mol (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). Tylophorinidine showed a hydrogen bond with ASN343 (glycosylation site) and binding energy of −6.9 kcal/mol. Licoagrodin from 
 <italic>G. glabra</italic> was found to interact with GLY339, ASP364, VAL367, and SER371 of RBD region with a binding affinity of −8.7 kcal/mol (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). Further analysis also showed that Hispaglabridin-B, Licoagrone, and Licocoumarin-A from 
 <italic>G. glabra</italic> to form hydrogen-bonded interactions with glycosylation site ASN343 with a binding energy of −8.2 kcal/mol, respectively. Cryptoxanthin showed hydrogen bond with ASN440, stabilized by 7 hydrophobic interactions having a binding energy of −8.4 kcal/mol (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>); while 3-O-Galloylepicatechin-(4Beta-6)-Epigallo-catechin-3-O-Gallate (−8.3 kcal/mol) showed hydrogen bonded interactions at positions: PHE338, ASN370, SER371, SER373, ASN437, and ASN440. Based on this significance it was considered for further studies. Furthermore, compounds namely, Camelliquercetiside-B (−7.8 kcal/mol), Procyanidin C1 (−7.8 kcal/mol), 3-O-Galloylepiafzelechin-(4Beta-6)-Epigallo-catechin-3-O-Gallate (−7.7 kcal/mol), Theasinensin B (−7.6 kcal/mol), Epigallocatechin-(2 Beta-7,4 Beta-8)-Epigallocatechin-3-O-Gallate (−7.5 kcal/mol), 3-O-Galloylepicatechin-(4 Beta-8)-Epicatechin-3-O-Gallate (−7.3 kcal/mol), and Theasinensin-C (−7.2 kcal/mol) from 
 <italic>C. sinensis</italic> also showed hydrogen bond with residue ASN343. Compounds from 
 <italic>J. adhatoda</italic> did not show any interactions with active residues, however interactions were observed with residues proximal to the active region: PHE342, SER371, and SER373. Among all the compounds studied from 
 <italic>J. adhatoda</italic>, Daucosterol showed the highest binding affinity
