<p>The use of 
 <italic>Camellia sinensis</italic> or tea as beverage and medicine has a long history of almost 5000 years. Chemically tea contains polyphenols, flavonoids, tannins, and caffeine derivatives with amino acids, having antioxidant and diverse therapeutic effects. Black tea is prepared from the green tea leaves by a series of fermentation when catechin (30%) of green leaves oxidized into theaflavins (theaflavin, theaflavin-3-gallate, theaflavin-3′-gallate, and theaflavin-3,3′-digallate) by dimerization and into thearubigins (17%) through polymerization. Tea flavonoids help in the reduction of inflammation, possess antimicrobial effects, and are used in the treatment of respiratory diseases such as asthma. A number of compounds like theaflavins and tannins from black and green tea have antiviral activities, mainly against bovine rotavirus and bovine coronavirus (

 <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have shown that theaflavin di-gallate inhibited the infectivity of influenza A and B viruses (

It is rich in polyphenolic compounds (flavonoids) and bonded benzene rings combined with multiple hydroxyl functional groups. A study on water-soluble phenols like tannic acid and theflavin-3-3′-digallate have shown to inhibit 3-chymotrypsin like protease (3CLpro) of SARS Coronavirus. Hence, it can be considered as a starting point for molecules against the SARS-CoV-2 (

 <italic>C. sinensis</italic>: Barrigenol, Kaempferol, and Myricetin have significant binding affinity with the active site of SARS-CoV2 Nsp15 protein (

In a similar study, Oolonghomobisflavan-A, Theasinensin-D, and Theaflavin-3-O-gallate from tea were compared with repurposed antivirals (Atazanavir, Darunavir, and Lopinavir) for their binding affinity with Mpro of SARS-CoV-2. The results revealed that Oolonghomobisflavan-A to be highly significant in terms of binding affinity and intermolecular interactions when compared to all the other repurposed antiviral inhibitors (
