<p>The most important aspect in docking studies is the identification of important residues and favorable cavity for ligand binding. In this study, the cavity definition was mainly performed based on the literature insights on important residues (ACE2 binding site) coupled with the cavity prediction using P2RANK (
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>). The P2RANK predicted cavity spanned the ACE2 binding residues, as well as on few glycosylation sites. It should be noted that viral glycosylation has many roles in viral pathogenesis and biology, as it affects protein folding and stable interaction with host cells (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). As discussed earlier, glycosylation process in coronaviruses mainly occur to camouflage the immunogenic process in the host. Targeting glycosylation sites can aid in the primary and rapid immune response to neutralize the virus (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Hence, along with ACE2 binding residues, glycosylation sites spanning the active cavity predicted by P2RANK were also considered for grid box generation. Considering the importance of the binding site with ACE2, glycosylation sites as well as the active cavity predicted by the P2RANK tool, the docking grid for molecular docking was fixed.
