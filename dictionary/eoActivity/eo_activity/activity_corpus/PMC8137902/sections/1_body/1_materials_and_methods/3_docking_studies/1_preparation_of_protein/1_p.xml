<p>The crystal structure of RBD (PDB id: 7BZ5) of spike protein presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> was downloaded from RCSB PDB (Protein Data Bank) (
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>). GUI based “Auto-Dock Tools” was used to prepare and execute the docking studies. Kollman atom charges, solvation parameters, and polar hydrogens were added to the protein and proceeded for docking studies. As the ligands used are not peptides, Gasteiger charges were assigned only to the protein and the non-polar hydrogens were merged. Based on the literature and predicted active regions, a grid box was assigned around the active sites using AutoGrid application (
