<p>Molecular Mechanics-Poisson Boltzmann Surface Area (MM-PBSA) calculation is one of the most commonly used method for enumerating binding free energy of protein-ligand complexes. The MM-PBSA combines energy calculations based on molecular mechanics and implicit solvent model. This method precisely estimates the binding free energy of the protein-ligand complex, which is estimated by the differences between the free energy of the complex and free energies of unbound individual components of the complex (
