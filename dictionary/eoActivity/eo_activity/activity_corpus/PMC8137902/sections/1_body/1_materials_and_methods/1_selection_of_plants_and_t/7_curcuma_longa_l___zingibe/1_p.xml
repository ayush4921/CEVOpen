 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> (Turmeric) belongs to the ginger family Zingiberaceae; and turmeric rhizome has been traditionally used in India for various ailments and diseases. Indian traditional and folklore medicine used turmeric to treat inflammation, infections, respiratory illness, gastric, hepatic, and blood disorders. Curcumin, the marker compound of turmeric is a well-studied therapeutic phyto-molecule, while curcumin and its derivatives are the major polyphenols of the rhizome (

The antiviral activity of curcumin and its derivatives have been established against a wide variety of pathogenic viruses including hepatitis, herpes simplex, human immune deficiency, human papilloma, influenza, and zika. The mechanism is mainly by inhibition of viral entry, replication, particle production, viral protease, and gene expression (

 <italic>C. longa</italic> confer significant antiviral activity against H5N1 virus 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> by inhibiting viral replication with significant upregulation of TNF-α and IFN-β mRNA expressions (

Anti-influenza activity of curcumin was earlier assessed by computational methods, wherein curcumin derivatives were docked against the HA protein of influenza (H1N1) virus. The results inferred that specific curcumin derivatives can be successfully used against influenza virus infection. Moreover, curcuminoids from the methanol extract of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> also provide strong inhibitory effects on the neuraminidases of H1N1 and H9N2, as non-competitive inhibitors (
