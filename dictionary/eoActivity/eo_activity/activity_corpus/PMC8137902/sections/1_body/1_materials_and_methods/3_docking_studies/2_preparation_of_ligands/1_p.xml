<p>The 2D/3D structures were retrieved from PubChem Database using a custom written python script which is hosted on GitHub portal (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/sandes89/PubDown" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://github.com/sandes89/PubDown</ext-link>). List of compounds with their chemical names were prepared as an input to Python script and searched iteratively on PubChem ftp database and the compounds were downloaded in sdf (Structure Data File) format. A total of 1,952 compounds were downloaded from PubChem database. In this study, POAP (
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>) was used for the preparation of ligands and for virtual screening. POAP tool is a bash shell script-based pipeline which can be used to optimize ligands for docking using Open Babel (
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>) and to perform virtual screening using Autodock Suite. POAP implements dynamic file handling methods for efficient memory usage and data organization, ligand minimization (5,000 steps), MMFF94 force-field was employed with the addition of hydrogens. A total of 50 conformations for each compound were generated using the weighted rotor search method, with minimization using the steepest descent method. Finally, the best conformation was retained in.pdbqt format for utilization in further docking studies.
