In particular, methanolic extract had a higher level of inhibition of influenza virus, by blocking viral attachment and inhibition of viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein. Detailed study revealed that the methanolic extract mainly comprised of Vasicine alkaloids have antiviral activity (

Aqueous extract of leaves is reported to inhibit the arachidonic acid metabolites through COX (TXB2) and LOX (LP1 and 12-HETE) pathways; while platelet aggregation studies showed butanol extract to exert strong inhibition against arachidonic acid, platelet activating factor, and collagen-induced aggregation (

Moreover, the methanolic extract showed 100% reduction in HA at 10 mg/ml; while the aqueous extracts at 5â€“10 mg/ml dose reduced the HA levels to 33 and 16.67%, respectively, suggesting strong anti-influenza activity by inhibiting viral attachment and/or replication (
