 <italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic> or Tulsi has been used for thousands of years for its diverse therapeutic activities, and is known as the “Queen of herbs” or the legendary “Incomparable one” of India with strong aroma and astringent taste. It is the holiest and most cherished plant for its healing and health-promoting properties and in TM, Tulsi is known as an adaptogen that balances different processes in the body and helps in adapting stress. Ayurveda treats it as a kind of “elixir of life” and is believed to promote longevity and a healthy body. Thus, extracts from Tulsi are used in many Ayurvedic remedies including the common cold, headache, stomach ailments, inflammation and heart disease (

 <italic>O. sanctum</italic> leaf extracts showed therapeutic, prophylactic, and virucidal activities. A study 
 <italic>in ovo</italic> model indicated its therapeutic activity against H9N2 virus by reducing the infection level (

 <italic>O. basilicum</italic> showed a broad spectrum of antiviral activities against DNA viruses (HSV, adenoviruses, hepatitis B virus) and RNA viruses (Coxsackievirus B1, Enterovirus 71), among which ursolic acid showed the strongest activity against HSV (

 <italic>O. sanctum</italic> showed significant virucidal activity (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001–0.01) and was found to decrease the virus genome copy numbers at the lowest dose up to 72 h post-infection (

 <italic>O. sanctum</italic> can be used as preventive against CoV due to its potential immunomodulatory, ACE2 blocking and viral replication inhibition properties (
