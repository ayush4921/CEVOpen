 <italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic> rhizome (Yashtimadhu) is used worldwide in various traditional systems of medicines. In Ayurveda it is an important drug component of Dasamoolarishtam, Aswagandharishtam, Madhu-yastyaditaila etc., as mentioned in Charaka Samhita. In folk medicine it is used as a laxative, emmenagogue, contraceptive, galactagogue, anti-asthmatic, anti-tussive, and antiviral agent. Being a member of the pea and bean family, the plant is best known for its use in making liquorice-flavored confectionery while roots and rhizomes are used for medicinal purposes. A number of pharmacological effects including expectorant and antitussive, antiviral against SARS-CoV, HIV, and in the treatment of diabetes, cancer, and hepatitis (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>) have been studied for this plant. The main chemical constituent of liquorice is glycyrrhizin, a triterpene saponin with a low haemolytic index; while the root contains glycyrrhetinic (Glycyrrhetic) acid, the aglycone of glycyrrhizin. Other active constituents of liquorice include isoflavonoids, chalcones, coumarins, triterpenoids, sterols, lignans, amino acids, amines, gums, and volatile oils (

 <italic>G. glabra</italic> comprises of 20 triterpenoids and around 300 flavonoid compounds. Among these 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid, glycyrrhizin, glabridin, licochalcone A, licochalcone E, and liquiritigenin have antimicrobial activity (

 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). Oral administration of 
 <italic>G. glabra</italic> extract has an antitussive effect by promoting pharyngeal and bronchial secretions leading to good expectorant action. Liquiritigenin, a flavonoid from the root extracts demonstrated anti-asthmatic activity (

 <italic>G. glabra</italic> had an accumulation of molecules having 3D similarities to influenza neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors. Further, it was elaborated in chemiluminescence (CL)-based NA inhibition assays on different influenza virus strains including an oseltamivir-resistant isolate A/342/09 (H1N1) that 11 out of 12 compounds had IC
 <sub>50</sub> in nanomolar to micromolar range (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). A study with 
 <italic>G. glabra</italic> leaf extract also revealed antiviral activity against Newcastle disease virus (NDV) with an highest embryo survival rate at 300 μg/ml (
