<p>Clove, the aromatic flower bud of 
 <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic> is one of the ancient traditionally used spices in almost every household in India, with several therapeutic properties for dental, digestive, and respiratory disorders, including asthma (

Cloves contain various classes of phytochemicals including sesquiterpenes, monoterpenes, hydrocarbons, and phenolics along with Eugenyl acetate, eugenol, and β-caryophyllene as principal components of clove oil. Various pharmacological studies with clove have shown its inhibitory effects on pathogenic bacteria, 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, and Herpes simplex and Hepatitis C viruses (

 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> extract have a significant impact on the inhibition of viral replication (

Pre-treatment of FCV with clove oil reduced viral titer to 6.0 logs. The antiviral activity of the pure eugenol was similar to the clove extract, albeit at a lower level (

 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> were found to be novel and effective against the Newcastle Viral Disease (NDV) 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and in embryonated eggs (
