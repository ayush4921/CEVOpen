<p>The ADME and toxicity profile of O-Demethyldemethoxycurcumin and Tellimagrandin II were predicted and summarized using pKCSM (
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>). The Intestinal absorption of O-Demethyldemethoxycurcumin was found to be high compared to Tellimagrandin-II i.e., 76.46 and 41.54%, respectively. O-Demethyl-demethoxycurcumin was found to be CYP3A4 substrate and inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2C9; whereas Tellimagrandin-II was predicted as a non-inhibitor. However, both the compounds were found to be non-substrate to CYP2D6 and non-inhibitor of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, thus shall be non-toxic. Further, both these compounds showed a negative effect in the AMES toxicity, which indicates its negligible effect on the different bacterial strains; and a negative effect on the hERG (Ether-à-go-go-Related Gene), thereby unlikely to cause arrhythmia; and do not have hepatotoxic property. The oral acute toxicity of O-Demethyl-demethoxycurcumin was predicted to be 2.23 mol/kg, whereas, for Tellimagrandin II it was 2.48 mol/kg. Similarly, the oral rat chronic toxicity of O-Demethyldemethoxycurcumin was predicted to be 2.715 log mol/kg body weights per day, whereas, for Tellimagrandin II it was 10.618 log mol/kg body weight per day. Both these compounds also scored significant KDeep ΔG (absolute binding affinity) and MM-PBSA values.
