<p>Using opiates is a global epidemic and it continues to spread. Finding a non-addicting agent to prevent the addiction process is one of the main concerns of researchers in this field, however, it has not yet fully solved (
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>). Opioid withdrawal symptoms include nausea or vomiting, rhinorrhea, dysphoric mood, muscle aches, pupil dilation, lacrimation, sweating, piloerection, yawning, diarrhea, insomnia and fever (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>). Previous studies conducted on lab animals have reported that 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> could be effective in reducing symptoms of opioid withdrawal syndrome. It has been observed that analgesic properties of alcoholic (0.96 g/kg, IP, for 4 days) and aqueous (1.68 g/kg and 2.4 g/kg, IP, for 4 days) extracts of rosemary have been antagonized by naloxone (5 mg/kg, SC). Thus, it might reinforce the interaction of rosemary with opioid receptors (

 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>) (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In another study, in 81 patients, it has been confirmed that rosemary (8-16 capsules/day, containing 300 mg dried leaves of rosemary) could be used as an herbal medicine for alleviating withdrawal syndrome symptoms during treatment strategies for opium addiction and likely addiction to other opioids. In this study, the effectiveness of rosemary in the reduction of insomnia, musculoskeletal pain in opium addicts and improvement of sleep was clearly demonstrated during 4 weeks (
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>). It is probable that the anticonvulsant effects observed in the former studies occur with the same mechanisms as rosemaryâ€™s effects on reducing insomnia in this study. An investigation by Hosseinzadeh 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 2006, showed that rosemary can decrease muscle jerks produced by morphine withdrawal syndrome (
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>). These beneficial properties of the plant might be attributed to psycho-stimulant and anti-inflammatory effects (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>). These documents revealed that rosemary might be used as an elective complementary compound to modify withdrawal syndrome through treatment procedure for opium addiction and likely addiction to other opioids.
