<p>As previous studies reported, the apoptosis process is activated in the dorsal horn of spinal cord after CCI surgery of sciatic nerve (
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>). However, the relation between neuronal apoptosis in the spinal cord and the occurrence of hyperalgesia and allodynia is not fully known yet. Apoptosis may cause structural changes in neurons, increase the sensitivity of the nociceptive system and finally induce hyperalgesia or allodynia (
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>). Astrocytes and microglia might have regulatory roles in neuropathic pain by releasing chemokines and cytokines. Microglia and astrocytes have different neuronal activity. However, sometimes their activities overlap in mediating CNS innate immune responses. Both of these cells are activated following nerve injury and might lead to inflammatory reactions and pathological impacts such as neuronal chronic inflammation, toxicity, and hyper-excitability (
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>). Thus, it could be concluded that anti-inflammatory and anti- apoptotic reactions may lead to the anti-hyperalgesic and anti-allodynic effects of rosemary after nerve injury. Some other research projects have been designed to investigate the underlying mechanisms of the alcoholic extract of rosemary and one of its main constituents, rosmarinic acid on neuropathic pain on rats. The results suggest that alcoholic extract of rosemary (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg, IP) and rosmarinic acid (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg, IP) reduced inflammatory responses by decreasing apoptosis-related mediators (Bax, cleaved caspase- 3, and 9), inflammatory factors (TNF-α, iNOS, toll-like receptor 4) and the protein levels of glial activation markers (Iba1, GFAP) in rats’ spinal cords. Rosmarinic acid might be partially responsible for observed protective effects (

 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>). These studies might offer a new potent and promising therapy in alleviating neuropathic pain, however, more research into the antinociceptive mechanisms of rosemary and its components as well as clinical studies on patients suffering from chronic conditions of pain will be mandatory.
