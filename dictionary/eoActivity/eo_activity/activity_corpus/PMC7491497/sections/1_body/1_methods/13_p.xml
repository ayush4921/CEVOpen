<p>Hippocampus is a part of the brain which has an important role in learning and memory, mood regulation, cognition and response to stress (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). It is one of the most vulnerable brain parts to oxidative stress (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). There are plenty of enzymatic and non-enzymatic anti-oxidant defense systems in cells to protect them from damages of free radical reactions (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Since the endogenous anti-oxidant protection systems are not 100% effective, we assume that nutritional anti-oxidants could have beneÔ¨Åcial effects on the memory, neurogenesis, and activities of enzymatic oxidative in the brain. Rasoolijazi and colleagues, 2015, evaluated the effect of rosemary extract on memory and anti-oxidant status of the hippocampus in middle-aged rats. They reported that prescription of rosemary extract (50,100 and 200 mg/kg/day, containing 40% carnosic acid, o.p.) for 12 weeks in middle-aged rats increased spatial memory and the activity of SOD and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) anti-oxidant enzymes (
