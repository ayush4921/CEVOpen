<p>Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of rosemary tea showed the presence of 16 compounds that are classified into the categories of flavonoids, diterpenes, and hydroxycinnamic derivatives; it was shown that rosmarinic acid was the major bioactive compound of the infusion, followed by a caffeic acid derivative and luteolin 7-O-glucuronide. Rosmarinic acid was also the major component of the water-soluble extract of rosemary leaf in the study of del Bano 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 2003, but it was found only in trace amounts in methanol and acetone extracts (

Hence, more investigations are necessary to explain the involved mechanisms, although the behavioral effects have been definitely demonstrated in several studies.
