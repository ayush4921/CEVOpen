<p>The present review demonstrates that the main ethnopharmacological uses (anti-spasm, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, anti-anxiety and memory-boosting) of rosemary have been validated by neuropharmacological investigations. By reviewing the previous literature, it is concluded that the most important components of rosemary which are medicinally and pharmacologically active are rosmarinic acid, carnosic acid, and the essential oil. These compounds can provide promising natural medicines in the treatment of the nervous system pathological conditions including anxiety, depression, Alzheimer’s disease, epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, and withdrawal syndrome.</p>
