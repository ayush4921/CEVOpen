<p>The antioxidant abilities of monoterpenes such as thymol and Î³-terpinene, along with other minor components in essential oil of the fruit of 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic>, may be responsible for preserving and improving the viability of spermatogonial cells of mice through induction of 
 <italic>Bcl2</italic> and inhibition of 
 <italic>BAX</italic>. Therefore, 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> oil can be a promising agent in the conservation of fertility in patients who suffer from malignancies and/or the fruits can be used as an appropriate nutraceutical formulation for the aforementioned purpose. Our results merely support the beneficial effect of 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> oil in cell culture. Further in vivo and trial studies are recommended concerning the protective properties of the plant.
