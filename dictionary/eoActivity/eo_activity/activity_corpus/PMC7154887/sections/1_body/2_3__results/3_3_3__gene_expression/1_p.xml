<p>A significant increase in the expression of genes related to the undifferentiated state, 
 <italic>ID-4</italic> and 
 <italic>Plzf</italic>, in spermatogonial cells in the treatment groups of 10, 20, and 30 µL of oil was observed, which was more than that in control group (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The enhancement of gene expression was higher in the treatment with 20 µL of oil in comparison to the others (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00343-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Meanwhile, the expression of the 
 <italic>c-Kit</italic> gene (differentiated gene) in all the treatment groups was significantly decreased compared to the control (
 <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.05), and greater amount of decrease observed in the presence of 20 µL of the oil than in the two other treatment groups. There was a significant decrease in the expression level of the 
 <italic>BAX</italic> gene (pro-apoptotic) in the presence of 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> oil in comparison with the control group (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The highest decrease in the level of the 
 <italic>BAX</italic> gene was obtained with 20 µL of the fruit oil, but treatments with 10 and 30 µL of the oil also considerably lowered the expression of the 
 <italic>BAX</italic> gene. After the oil treatment, expression of 
 <italic>Bcl2</italic> increased significantly in the presence of the oil compared with the control group (
 <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.05). All the oil amounts raised the expression of 
 <italic>Bcl2</italic>, and the oil at an amount of 30 µL affected the expression of 
 <italic>Bcl2</italic> (antiapoptotic) more than the other treatments.
