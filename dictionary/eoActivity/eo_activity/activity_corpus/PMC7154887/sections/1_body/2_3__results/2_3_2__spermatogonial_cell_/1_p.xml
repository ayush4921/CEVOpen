<p>Flow cytometry analysis showed that 92.8% of the isolated cells from mice testes expressed 
 <italic>Stra8</italic>, a spermatogonial stem cell marker. The diameters of all the colonies treated with 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> oil were significantly higher than those of the control group (
 <xref rid="plants-09-00343-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), while there was no significant difference observed between the treatment groups in the increase of colonies’ diameters. The respective diameters of the control group were 48.6 ± 0.64 and 195.57 ± 1.36 mm in the first and second weeks. In the first week, colony diameters in the treatments of 10, 20, and 30 µL of the oil were 78.42 ± 2.31, 89.26 ± 0.48, and 79.71 ± 0.68 mm, respectively. The diameters of the colonies increased similarly, and 20 µL of the oil induced colony diameters (283.53 ± 8.05 mm) that were higher than the other treatments in the second week of the study. Colony diameters in the presence of the oil (10 and 30 µL) were increased to 272.26 ± 11.23 and 276.35 ± 0.48 mm, respectively. The number of colonies was significantly increased in the presence of all concentrations of the plant oil in both weeks of observation compared with control group (
 <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.05). Similar to the diameters of the colonies, the number of colonies increased in the presence of 20 µL of oil, from 17 ± 1.1 in the first week to 28 ± 1.2 in the second week, compared to the other groups. In the other treatment groups, i.e., 10 and 30 µL of oil, the colony numbers enhanced after two weeks to 25 ± 1.7 and 26 ± 1.1, respectively.
