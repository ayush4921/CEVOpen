<p>Fruits of 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> (100 g) yielded 3.5 mL of yellow colored essential oil with a gravity of 0.97 mg/mL. As it was indicated in our previous study, 13 monotrepenes composed 99.1% of the oil, as identified using the gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method. Thymol (74.2%), 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (16%), and γ-terpinene (7.1%) were the main constituents of the oil [
 <xref rid="B11-plants-09-00343" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, the amount of thymol as a major component was assayed in the oil using the GC method. According to the thymol calibration curve, the amount of thymol was 130.7 ± 7.6 µg/mL in the essential oil of 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> fruit.
