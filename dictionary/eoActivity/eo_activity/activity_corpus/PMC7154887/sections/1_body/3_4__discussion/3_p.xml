<p>Gene expressions were analyzed after 2 weeks of the treatment with 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> oil, indicating that the oil influenced gene expressions in spermatogonial cells. The expression of 
 <italic>BAX</italic> and 
 <italic>Bcl2</italic> genes was changed in favor of reduction of apoptosis in the cells. Markers of spermatogonial cells, 
 <italic>ID-4</italic> and 
 <italic>Plzf</italic>, were overexpressed in the presence of the oil, whereas expression of the 
 <italic>c-Kit</italic> gene was reduced. According to the data of another study, treatment of Chang liver cells with thymol suppressed apoptosis induced by oxidative stress, through the reduction of expression of the 
 <italic>BAX</italic> gene and induction of the 
 <italic>Bcl2</italic> gene. It was concluded that thymol protected cells via the inhibition of ROS, increases in glutathione, and decreases in malonyl aldehyde [

 <xref rid="B37-plants-09-00343" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Both thymol and carvacrol at lower concentrations showed antioxidant activity. It is common for phenolic compounds to show antioxidant and pro-oxidant properties depending on their concentrations [

 <italic>T. ammi</italic> oil.
