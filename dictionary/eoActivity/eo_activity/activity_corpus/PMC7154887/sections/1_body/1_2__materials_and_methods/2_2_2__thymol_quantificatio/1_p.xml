<p>According to the composition previously reported in our study, thymol is the major component of the plant’s oil [
 <xref rid="B11-plants-09-00343" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, the amount of thymol was analyzed quantitatively using a Dani Master GC (Dani, Italy) with an OV1 column (SE54CB, 25 m × 0.25 mm internal diameter 0.25 µm film thickness), nitrogen as a carrier gas, with a split ratio of 1:30, and a flame ionization detector (FID). Temperature programming was performed from 75 °C (42 min) to 250 °C (14 min) at 15 °C/min. Injector and detector temperatures were 250 and 260 °C, respectively. Thymol with a concentration of 12.5 to 100 µL/mL was prepared to obtain the calibration curve. The oil of the fruit was injected into the column under the same conditions, and the amount of thymol was calculated using the following equations (Equations (1) and (2)):
