<p>Male laboratory mice (3-6 days old) were purchased from the National Medical Research Institute (NMRI) and maintained in accordance with the guidelines issued by Tehran University of Medical Sciences. Spermatogonial stem cells were isolated in two steps of enzymatic digestion from testis tissue. Phosphate buffered saline (PBS; Sigma, Munich, Germany) was applied to wash the collected testes of mice. Testes were minced into small pieces after removing the tunica albuginea and then digested in a medium containing collagenase type IV (1 mg/mL; Sigma), hyaluronidase (0.5 mg/mL; Sigma), and DNase (10 µg/mL; Sigma) in minimum essential medium alpha (MEMα; Sigma) for 20 min. The tubules were separated with shaking at 37 °C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The cells were centrifuged at 1500×
