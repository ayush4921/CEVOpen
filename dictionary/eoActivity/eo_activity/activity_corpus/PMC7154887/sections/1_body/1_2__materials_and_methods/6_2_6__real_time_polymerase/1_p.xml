<p>The pluripotency of the spermatogonial cells was examined by evaluating the expression levels of 
 <italic>ID-4</italic> and 
 <italic>Plzf</italic> alongside the apoptosis regulators 
 <italic>BAX</italic>, 
 <italic>Bcl2</italic>, and tyrosine-protein kinase (

 <xref rid="plants-09-00343-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Total RNA was extracted by an RNase kit (Accuzole Total RNA Extraction Kit, K-3090, Kentucky, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. One microgram of total RNA was used in the synthesis of cDNA using reverse a transcription kit (Thermo Scientific, K1621, Kentucky, USA). Real-time PCR was performed with 40 reaction amplifications using 7500 fast real-time PCR and the detection of SYBR Green (Applied Bioscience, Carlsbad, CA, USA). All samples were normalized against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (internal control) using the comparative CT method (ΔΔCT) [
