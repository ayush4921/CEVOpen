<p>Genetic information is transmitted to the next generation by spermatogonial stem cells, which are extensively rare, composing about 0.03% of germ cells [

Fertility in cancer patients may be threatened due to gonadotoxic therapies, including chemotherapy and irradiation, that can affect the spermatogenesis process.Therefore, protection of germ cells can be considered an alternative strategy to conserve fertility in these patients [
 <xref rid="B22-plants-09-00343" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Previous studies revealed protective effects of extracts and natural compounds on spermatogonial cells. For instance, quercetin protected spermatogonial cells in the presence of oxidant agents [
