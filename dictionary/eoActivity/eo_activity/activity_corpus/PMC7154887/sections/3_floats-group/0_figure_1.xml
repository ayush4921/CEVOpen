  <p>Expression patterns of 
   <italic>Plzf</italic>, 
   <italic>ID-4</italic>, 
   <italic>c-Kit</italic>, 
   <italic>BAX</italic>, and 
   <italic>Bcl2</italic> genes after treatment with different amounts of 
   <italic>T. ammi</italic> fruit oil (10, 20, and 30 ÂµL). Expressions of 
   <italic>Plzf</italic> and 
   <italic>ID-4</italic> were increased after treatment with oil, while the expression of 
   <italic>c-Kit</italic> was decreased. Expression levels of 
   <italic>BAX</italic> and 
   <italic>Bcl2</italic> were decreased and increased after treatment, respectively. Stars show significant differences between treatment groups and the control group (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).
