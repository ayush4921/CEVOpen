<p>In our opinion, the administration of herbal therapy to the patients with endometriosis could be a topic of great interest for the supporters of natural therapies. Low cost, decreased number of side effects, increased bioavailability, as well as the favorable results reported until now are several of the arguments that could support the naturopathic treatment of this pathology. However, considering that the etiopathology of endometriosis is so debated and not fully elucidated, it requires caution in deciding the therapeutic management. Moreover, the lack of human clinical trials represents a major disadvantage for this therapy, although in vitro and in vivo studies are very promising.</p>
