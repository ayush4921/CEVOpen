<p>Despite being a benign gynecological condition, endometriosis continues to be a debilitating disease for young women in reproductive age, due to the symptoms that it develops. Chronic pelvic pain, vaginal bleeding, infertility, and malignant transformation are the most widely encountered symptoms. Considering the lack of specific symptoms and specific biomarkers for endometriosis diagnosis, the accurate diagnosis could be delayed for years, and the gold-standard remains surgery followed by histopathological exam. Medicinal herbs and their bioactive compounds exhibit anti-angiogenic, antioxidant, sedative and pain-alleviating properties and the beneficial effects recorded until now encourage their use for the management of endometriosis.</p>
