<p>The epigenetic theory suggests that during organogenesis, Homeobox and Wingless family genes are fundamental for the development of urogenital tract structures. A dysregulation at the level of Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway will result in an abnormal arrangement of the stem cells. Pro-inflammatory peritoneal habitat, immune alteration and the abnormal arrangement of the stem cells will evolve into endometriosis [

Additionally, miRNAs dysregulations were reported as trigger factors for a more aggressive proliferation and invasion of the endometrial cells in ectopic sites. Epigenetics has an indirect role in the differentiation of bone marrow-derived stem cells by regulating the steroid action and the inflammatory microenvironment. The interaction leads to the recruitment of bone marrow-derived stem cells, which are vastly affected by the epigenetic expression [
