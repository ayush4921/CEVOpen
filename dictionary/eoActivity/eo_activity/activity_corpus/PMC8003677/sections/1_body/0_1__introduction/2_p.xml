<p>Endometriosis is considered a multi-factorial disorder of unclear etiology, induced by genetic, hormonal, and immunological factors. Several theories have been suggested in order to explain the ethiopathogenesis of endometriosis. The most accepted theory is Sampson’s retrograde menstruation theory, which implies that endometriosis develops as a result of a retrograde flow of discarded endometrial debris through the fallopian tubes towards the peritoneal cavity during menstruation [
