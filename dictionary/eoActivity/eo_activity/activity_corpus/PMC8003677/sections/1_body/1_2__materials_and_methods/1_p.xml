<p>This study is a review of the last twenty years of English literature, regarding the alternative treatments of endometriosis. With an ongoing interest in the field of plant-based therapy for endometriosis, we aimed to address this topic given the high burden that this gynecological dysfunction possesses on public health. A long array of studies on the conventional medical treatment of endometriosis were conducted. However, plant-based therapies raised more and more attention for their pharmaceutical properties against this gynecological pathology and our objective was to bring together all the studies conducted on this topic. Our research included all the papers published during January 2000 and July 2020, related to herbal and phytochemicals therapy for endometriosis, and to their mechanisms of action. We used the following Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) keywords: “endometriosis”, “Traditional Chinese Medicine”, “medicinal plants”, “nutraceuticals”, and “phytochemicals”. Two authors separately identified the relevant papers and selected them based on the following inclusion criteria: full-text original articles, written in English, conducted in vivo, in vitro or clinical trials on humans. The exclusion criteria were: papers written in other language than English, abstracts, and duplicate papers. A total number of 143 studies were selected and after the exclusion of duplicates, 75 studies fitted our area of interest and respected our criteria.</p>
