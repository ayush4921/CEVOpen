<p>The inflammatory environment of this disease points out an increased production of estrogens. This event will raise the production of PGs through the activation of both Nuclear factor ÎºB (NF-kB) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) [

 <xref rid="B32-plants-10-00587" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] highlighted the influence of COX-2 and PGE2 on the promotion of the migration and invasion of endometrial cells. Furthermore, the inhibition of COX-2 was able to decline the invasion of epithelial and stromal cells in endometriosis.
