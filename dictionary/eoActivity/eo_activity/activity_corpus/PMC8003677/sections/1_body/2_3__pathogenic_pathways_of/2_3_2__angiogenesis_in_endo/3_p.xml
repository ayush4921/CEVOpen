<p>VEGF exhibits angiogenic effects by inducing the expression of several molecules, such as α1β1, α2β1, and αvβ3-integrins. These integrins regulate and promote cellular migration, proliferation, and matrix reorganization [
 <xref rid="B59-plants-10-00587" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The transcription of VEGF mRNA, induced by hypoxia, is regulated through a mechanism, which consist of the binding of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) to an HIF-1 binding site. This site is located in the promoter of VEGF. The transcription of VEGF mRNA is triggered by the activation of a stress-inducible PI3K/Akt pathway [
