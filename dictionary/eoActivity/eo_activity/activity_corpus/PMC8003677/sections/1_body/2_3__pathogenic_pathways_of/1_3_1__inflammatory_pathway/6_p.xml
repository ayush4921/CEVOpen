<p>Different alterations of the MMPs activity are considered compelling factors in endometriosis development [

 <xref rid="B38-plants-10-00587" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Most of the MMPs are secreted as dormant pro-enzymes, which later will be activated via proteolytic action. MMPs action is controlled by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), and by the endogenous inhibitors [
