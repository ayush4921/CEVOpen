<p>VEGF is an angiogenic growth factor, usually highly expressed in tumors and endometriosis. This molecule increases the permeability of endothelial cells via two mechanisms: by enhancing the activity of vesicular-vacuolar organelles and by mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signal transduction cascade, which targets the loose of adhering junctions between endothelial cells via rearrangement of adhesion complexes [
