<p>Recent reports have pointed out the major role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in endometriosis-related inflammation. In healthy individuals, there is a balance between ROS and antioxidants. When this balance bends toward ROS overproduction, oxidative stress increases, leading to the inflammatory process via the upregulation of various proinflammatory factors [

 <xref rid="B47-plants-10-00587" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Hydroxyl radicals are considered to be the highest reactive free radical species [
 <xref rid="B48-plants-10-00587" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. They have the capacity to react with many cellular constituents such as amino acid residues, and also to attack the annular lipid shell, leading to lipid peroxidation [

 <xref rid="B53-plants-10-00587" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The essential role of ROS in endometriosis consists of the positive regulation of transcription factors such as NF-kB and activator-protein 1. These molecules regulate several genes involved in the cellular defense and in the expression of various proinflammatory cytokines, integrins and cadherins [
