<p>Eutopic endometrial cells are rich in NF-k subunits which activate during menstruation. The activation of these subunits in endometriotic cells in vitro increased the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, IL-6, IL-8, ICAM-1, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), TNF-α, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), and MCP-1 [

The common point of view of the reaserchers is that in endometriosis, NF-kappa B represents the link between the inflammation process and the expression of aromatase. The activation of NF-kappa B subunits, followed by the translocation from the cytoplasm to cell nuclei, represents the first step to induce the inflammatory process [
 <xref rid="B35-plants-10-00587" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Activated NF-kB will release IL-6, IL-8, IL-1, TNF- α, and VEGF, leading to chronic inflammation.
