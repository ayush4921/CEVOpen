<p>Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) levels are increased in cancers and endometriosis, because these pathologies involve increased rates of angiogenesis. FGFs are important angiogenic molecules and endothelial cells survival factors. In addition, the expression of VEGF mRNA in endometriosis is up-regulated by high levels of bFGF. Overexpression of this molecule also up-regulates the expression of the proteins Bcl-XL and Bcl-2, with anti-apoptosis role, through the MEK/ERK signaling pathway [
