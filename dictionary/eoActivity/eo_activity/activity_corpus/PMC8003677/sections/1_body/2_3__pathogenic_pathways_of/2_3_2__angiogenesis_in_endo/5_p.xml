<p>In the last years, accumulating evidence showed that miRNAs target various angiogenic factors and protein kinases, and enhances neovascularization. In addition, these molecules can promote or inhibit angiogenesis in endometriotic lesions, through the modulation of pro-angiogenic signals (induced by VEGF) or anti-angiogenic signals (induced by thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1)). Moreover, miRNA targets receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and can crosstalk with ROS, influencing the angiogenesis process [
