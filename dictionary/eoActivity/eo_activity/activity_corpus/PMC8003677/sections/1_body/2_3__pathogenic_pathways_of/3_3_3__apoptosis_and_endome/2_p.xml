<p>The apoptotic process is triggered by caspases, a group of protease enzymes, which determine the cleavage of C-terminal fragments into residues of aspartic acid upon activation [
 <xref rid="B65-plants-10-00587" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The main class of caspases is represented by caspase-9 homologues, also called “effector caspases” or “initiators”. In animals, a complex composed by cytochromes, CED-4/Apaf-1 and procaspase-9, known as apoptosome, determine the activation of procaspase-9, which causes the effector caspase downstream cascade, and consequently, the degradation of the cells [

It is considered that apoptosis is triggered via extrinsic pathway, through the interaction between TNFα, Fas ligand (FasL/CD95L), transforming growth factor β (TGFβ), caspases and B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) family. Different studies pointed out that the endometrium of the endometriotic women expresses lower levels of pro-apoptotic factors (e.g., Bax), and increased levels of Bcl-2, an anti-apoptotic factor, in comparison with unaffected women [
