<p>Existing data suggests that miR-191 suppresses TNFÎ±-induced cell death in ectopic endometrium from endometriosis patients. Additionally, miR-191 targets DAPK1, which represents a mediator of the cellular death. Thus, miR-191-DAPK1 pathway could not only be involved in the development of endometriotic lesions, but it could determine the malignant transformation of this condition [
