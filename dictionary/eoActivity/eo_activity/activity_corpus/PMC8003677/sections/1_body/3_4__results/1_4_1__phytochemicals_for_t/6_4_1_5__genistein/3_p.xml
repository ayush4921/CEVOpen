<p>In order to sustain the potential of genistein as phytoestrogen, Cotroneo et al. [
 <xref rid="B103-plants-10-00587" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>] attached uterine tissue to intestinal mesentery of Dawley rats. They observed that injections of genistein reduced uterine ER-Î±, while pharmacologic injections of genistein significantly increased PR(B). They concluded that pharmacologically and not dietary genistein administration supported surgically induced endometriosis in ovariectomized rats and this molecule is a strong estrogen agonist.
