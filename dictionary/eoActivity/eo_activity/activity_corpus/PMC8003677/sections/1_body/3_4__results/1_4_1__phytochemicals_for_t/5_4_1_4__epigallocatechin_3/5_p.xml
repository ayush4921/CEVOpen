<p>In plasma, EGCG reduced the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-17, IL-22 and IL-23. In addition, the level of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Î±), IL-18, CD18, CD11s, and miRNA was decreased by EGCG administration [

 <xref rid="B96-plants-10-00587" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>] showed that EGCG promoted apoptosis in vitro by increasing the levels of caspase-3 and using STAT3 and P53/Bcl-2 signaling pathways. Moreover, it suppressed the migration and invasion of tumoral cells by inducing the down-regulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 [
