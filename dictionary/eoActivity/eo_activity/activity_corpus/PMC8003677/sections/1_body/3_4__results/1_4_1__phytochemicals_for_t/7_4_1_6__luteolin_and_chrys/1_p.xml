Luteolin inhibited cell proliferation by inducing cell cycle arrest and DNA fragmentation in VK2/E6E7 (vaginal mucosa-derived epithelial endometriotic cells) and End1/E6E7 (endocervix-derived endometriotic cells) endometriotic cells. In endometriosis mice, intraperitoneally injected with luteolin, a significant reduction of the lesions size was reported. Furthermore, luteolin suppresses endometriosis progression by downregulation of the MAPK and PI3K/AKT signal proteins [
