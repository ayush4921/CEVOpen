 <italic>Zingiber officinale,</italic> also known as Ginger, is a widely used root in Asian cuisine; also, it is used as medicine, due to its multiple beneficial pharmaceutical properties. Shagaols, are bioactive compounds found in dried ginger, which possess anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antioxidant, and neuroprotective activities [

 <xref rid="B203-plants-10-00587" ref-type="bibr">203</xref>] explored the effects of 6-shogaol on endometriosis rats models and described the main anti-inflammatory pathways of this bioactive compound. After one month of oral gavage with 6-shagol, the surface of the endometriotic lesions was reduced, the histological analysis suggesting atrophy and major regression. 6-shagol modulated the expression of VEGF and VEGFR-2 and down-regulated NF-κB signaling. Furthermore, pro-inflammatory factors such as IL-6, IL-1β, PGE2 and NO were suppressed. In these conditions, 
 <italic>Z. officinale</italic> extracts seem to be promising therapeutic agents for the management of endometriosis.
