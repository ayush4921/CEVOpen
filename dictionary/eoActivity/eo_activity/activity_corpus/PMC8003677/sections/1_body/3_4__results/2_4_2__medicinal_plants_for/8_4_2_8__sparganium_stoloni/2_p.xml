<p>Sun et al. [
 <xref rid="B170-plants-10-00587" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>] investigated the effects of 
 <italic>R. sparganii</italic> in pregnant rodents. They reported that 
 <italic>R. sparganii</italic> significantly lowered the levels of FGF-1 and VEGF, and the expression of ER-alpha was inversely proportional to FGF-1. In these conditions, 
 <italic>R. sparganii</italic> demonstrated its anti-angiogenic and anti-estrogenic activities. SpaTA is a novel polysaccharide isolated from the water extraction of 
 <italic>R. sparganii.</italic> It induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells via caspase-3, 8, and 9 signaling and modulated estrogen signaling. Furthermore, SpaTA regulated the expression of ER-alpha and its nuclear translocation [

 <italic>S. Stoloniferum</italic> include IL-8, EGFR, TNF, and VEGFA, which are several of the causal genes of endometriosis [
