<p>Pro-EGCG is a derivative of EGCG obtained by acetylation, which showed more potent anti-angiogenic effects that EGCG in mice models. It also possesses a better bioavailability in vivo in comparison with EGCG. Both EGCG and pro-EGCG inhibit the expression of VEGF and VEGFR activity, being valuable anti-angiogenic agents. Furthermore, they exert anti-oxidant activity in vitro and in vivo [
