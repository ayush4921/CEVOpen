 <xref rid="B108-plants-10-00587" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>] showed that chrysin exerted pro-apoptotic effects on End1/E6E7 and VK2/E6E7 endometriotic cells. Furthermore, it inhibited the proliferation of the cells. The programmed cell death was induced by increasing intracytosolic level of reactive oxygen species. Moreover, chrysin downregulated PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in a dose-dependent manner.
