<p>Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B116-plants-10-00587" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>] have demonstrated that puerarin is able to suppress the vascularization and invasion of estrogen-stimulated endometriotic tissues. E2 increases MMP-9 and decreased TIMP-1 accumulation, leading to an increased invasiveness of endometriotic cells. Puerarin efficiently reversed these effects and, in addition, it degreased the levels of VEGF and ICAM-1, proving its anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic activities. Another study from the year 2012 [

The mechanism consisted of the downregulation of Cyclin D1, Cox-2, Cyp19, and by the abrogation of ERK pathway phosphorylation. Moreover, puerarin has been reported to downregulate mTOR signalling pathways, NF-kB signalling pathways, BCl-2 and PI3K proteins, and to increase the activity of c- Jun N terminal kinase, miR-16, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase by 50%. All these mechanisms lead to decreased cell proliferation and increased programmed cellular death [
