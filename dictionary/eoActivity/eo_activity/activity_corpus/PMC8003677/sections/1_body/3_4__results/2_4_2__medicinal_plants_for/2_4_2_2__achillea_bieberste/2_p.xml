<p>Demirel et al. [
 <xref rid="B143-plants-10-00587" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>] reported that 
 <italic>A. biebersteinii</italic> reduced the volume of ectopic endometrial tissue areas and inhibited the developments of pelvic adhesions. After the administration of 
 <italic>A. biebersteinii</italic> extracts, the levels of IL-6, VEGF, and TNF-Î± significantly decreased. In combination with 
 <italic>Foeniculum vulgare</italic>, 
 <italic>Peganum harmala</italic>, 
 <italic>Nigella sativa,</italic> and 
 <italic>Curcumin cyminum</italic>, this medicinal herb exerted strong effects against endometriosis-related dysmenorrhea. Furthermore, ethanol extracts of 
 <italic>A. biebersteinii</italic> have been reported to possess strong antioxidant activity [
