<p>Xiao et al. [
 <xref rid="B152-plants-10-00587" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>] demonstrated for the first time that diallyl trisulfide, a constituent of garlic, is able to inhibit angiogenesis in human endothelial cells. It suppressed the formation of novel capillaries, decreased the secretion of VEGF and VEGF receptor 2 and inactivated Akt kinase. Furthermore,
