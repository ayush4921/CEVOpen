<p>Genistein is an isoflavone isolated from soy. It possesses strong phytoestrogenic effects and both in vivo and in vitro studies have reported its efficiency for the management of endometriosis [
 <xref rid="B4-plants-10-00587" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This molecule was reported to decrease the surface of the endometriotic implants and the histopathologic score through anti-angiogenic and anti-proliferative mechanisms [
 <xref rid="B98-plants-10-00587" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Genistein exerts its anti-angiogenic effects by reducing the activity of PTK and MAPK, and by inhibiting HIF-1 and VEGF gene expression [
