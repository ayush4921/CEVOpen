 <xref rid="B110-plants-10-00587" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>] reported for the first time the antiproliferative effects of myricetin in endometriosis. They demonstrated that this compound inhibits cell cycle progression and cellular proliferation of human End1/E6E7 and VK2/E6E7 cells. In addition, myricetin leads to apoptosis by inducing the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and ROS accumulation. In mouse model, this flavonol regressed the size of endometriotic foci by inhibiting Ccne1, and decreased the activation of AKT and ERK1/2 proteins. Considering these findings, myricetin could be a promising molecule for the management of endometriosis, but further research are urgently necessary in order to better describe the mechanisms of action against this gynecological condition.
