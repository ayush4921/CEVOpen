<p>Kim et al. [
 <xref rid="B147-plants-10-00587" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>] used human endometriotic cells and reported that 
 <italic>A. princeps</italic> leaf extract induced apoptosis in vitro. Pro-apoptotic mechanism consisted of the regulation of p38 and NF-kB pathways. In addition, 
 <italic>A. princeps</italic> extracts inhibited the expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, XIAP, caspase 3, caspase 8, and caspase 9 in a dose-dependent manner.
