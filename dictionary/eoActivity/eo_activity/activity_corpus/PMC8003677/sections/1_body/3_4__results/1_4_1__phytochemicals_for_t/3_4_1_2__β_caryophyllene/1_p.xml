These biological effects are possible through the suppression of PI3K/AKT/mTOR/S6K1 signaling pathways and the activation of ROS-mediated MAPKs. β-caryophyllene potentiates apoptosis and suppresses tumoral cells invasion via the activation of NF-kB. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that β-caryophyllene suppresses the expression of Bcl-xL, IAP1, IAP2, Bcl-2, VEGF, MMP-9, COX-2, ICAM-1, and c-Myc [
