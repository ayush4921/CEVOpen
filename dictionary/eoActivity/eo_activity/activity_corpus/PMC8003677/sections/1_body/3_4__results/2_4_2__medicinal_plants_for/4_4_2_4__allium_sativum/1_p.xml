 <italic>A. sativum</italic> also known as garlic, is part of the Liliaceae family, and it is one of the most commonly used plants, with various pharmacological properties. Using human endometrial stromal cells, Kim et al. [
 <xref rid="B151-plants-10-00587" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>] showed that hexane extract of aged black garlic reduced cellular proliferation through the reduction of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 expression. Further, pro-apoptotic activity of 
 <italic>A. sativum</italic> was confirmed via caspase-3 increased activity and by Bax: Bcl-2 increased ratio.
