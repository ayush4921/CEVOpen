<p>Machado et al. [
 <xref rid="B192-plants-10-00587" ref-type="bibr">192</xref>] investigated the effects of 
 <italic>E. oleracea</italic> on rat models with endometriosis. After the treatment, they observed a significant decrease of the endometriotic lesions surface. Furthermore, 
 <italic>E. oleracea</italic> demonstrated its anti-inflammatory properties, by decreasing the levels of VEGF, PGE2, MMP-9, and COX-2. Through the activation of caspase-3, 
 <italic>E. oleracea</italic> induced apoptosis and decreased cellular proliferation [
