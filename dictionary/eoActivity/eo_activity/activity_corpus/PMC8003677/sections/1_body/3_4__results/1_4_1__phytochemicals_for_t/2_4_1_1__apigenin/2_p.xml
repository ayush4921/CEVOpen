<p>Park et al. [
 <xref rid="B75-plants-10-00587" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] used human endometriosis cell lines (VK2/E6E7 and End1/E6E7) and observed that apigenin induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, it disrupted the mitochondrial membrane potential and increased cytosolic concentration of Bax and cytochrome c, which are pro-apoptotic proteins. A recent study [
 <xref rid="B76-plants-10-00587" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] pointed out that apigenin is a potential phytoprogestin, a natural progesterone-like molecule capable to interact with the progesterone receptor (PR). It blocked the increase of endometrial cells height, suppressed genistein-induced proliferation of the endometrial cells and increased the expression of Hand2, a transcription factor stimulated by PR. In conclusion, apigenin is valuable for its antiproliferative, anti-angiogenic, anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects, but it is also useful for its progesterone-like activity.
