<p>Xanthohumol is a bioactive molecule contained by the female inflorescence of 
 <italic>Humulus lupulus</italic> L., which has been widely used in plant-based medicine due to its beneficial activities. Beer is the most important dietary source of xanthohumol [

 <xref rid="B134-plants-10-00587" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>] have reported that xanthohumol decreased the size of peritoneal ectopic endometrial tissue areas in mice, and reduced the level of phosphoinositide 3-kinase protein. Moreover, this molecule selectively lowered the density of microvessels from the endometriotic foci, without affecting uterine or ovarian vascularization. The anti-angiogenic function of xanthohumol was exerted via AKT/ NF-ÎºB inhibition [
