<p>Xu et al. [
 <xref rid="B91-plants-10-00587" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>] reported that EGCG suppressed vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGFC) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) in endometriotic foci. Furthermore, it significantly decreased the expression of VEGFC in endothelial cells and downregulated VEGFC/VEGFR2 signaling pathway in vivo, leading to decreased angiogenesis.
