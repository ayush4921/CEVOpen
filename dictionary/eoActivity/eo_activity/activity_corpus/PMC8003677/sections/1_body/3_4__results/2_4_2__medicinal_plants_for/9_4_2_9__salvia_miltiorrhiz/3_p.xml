 <italic>S. miltiorrhiza</italic> on Sprague-Dawley rats. After the administration of 
 <italic>S. miltiorrhiza</italic> extracts, serum CA-125 and the levels of IL-18 and TNF-Î± in the peritoneal fluid significantly were decreased, while peritoneal fluid levels of IL-13 increased, proving the anti-inflammatory properties of this medicinal herb. 
 <italic>S. miltiorrhiza</italic> also showed strong antioxidant potential. Its constitutive polysaccharides increased the activity of GPx, SOD, CAT, MDA, and decreased MDA production [
