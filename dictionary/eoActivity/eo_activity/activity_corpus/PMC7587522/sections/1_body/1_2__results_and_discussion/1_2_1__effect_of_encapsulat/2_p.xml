<p>The findings of chemical analysis of the oil nanoemulsions by GC–MS showed a great difference from that of the HD oil. Only 13 constituents were identified in nanoemulsions, representing 98.65% of the total nanoemulsion oil. Like HD oil, oxygenated monoterpenes were predominant but with quantitative distinctions, carvacrol (41.27%) and thymol (29.99%) were predominant, while borneol and α-terpineol were detected in minor amounts in comparison with their concentrations in HD oil (0.41% and 1.60%, respectively) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04756-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). Some of the non-oxygenated terpenes, e.g., α-terpenine and γ-terpinene, were increased in the oil nanoemulsion, whereas other predominates, such as α-pinene and camphene, were not detected in comparison with the HD oil. Most of the studies dealt with the encapsulation of oils or flavors and focused on the physical stability and biological activity of the microparticles or nanoparticles but not on the changes in the volatile constituents of the encapsulated oils. Few studies have reported that the formulation based on energy-intensive techniques may lead to Ostwald ripening, flocculation, or coalescence of the emulsion with changes in its physical stability and biological activity [

To the best of our knowledge, nothing has been reported about the effect of encapsulation techniques on chemical changes among the divergent terpenes of essential oils or flavors. Interestingly, the large predominance of thymol and carvacrol in the oil nanoemulsion was at the expense of borneol and α-terpineol concentrations detected in the HD oil (

Therefore, further studies can be conducted to examine the stability of different aroma and volatile compounds during microencapsulation techniques, especially under severe conditions, and discover the mechanisms of the transfer of such volatile compounds to others.
