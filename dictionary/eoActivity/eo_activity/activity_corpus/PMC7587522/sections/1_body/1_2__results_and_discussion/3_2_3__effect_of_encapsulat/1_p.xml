<p>Many diseases, such as cancer, liver disease, and Alzheimer’s disease, result from oxidative damage. The ability of antioxidants to prevent oxidative damage made from antioxidant activity test is one of the most intensively studied topics [

 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-04756" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The DPPH (2,2′-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) free radical–scavenging, CUPRAC (Cupric reducing antioxidant capacity), and ABTS (2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) cation radical decolorizationassays are widely used for the evaluation of plant antioxidant activity and are sensitive in detecting active compounds, even at very low concentrations [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-04756" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. These techniques were implemented to evaluate the antioxidant activity of the 
 <italic>S. satureioides</italic> Coss. et Durieu HD oil and its nanoemulsions. The findings revealed that the antioxidant activity of the HD oil of 
 <italic>S. satureioides</italic> was high with the lowest IC
 <sub>50</sub> and A
 <sub>0.5</sub> values (22.14, 37.72, and 11.39 µg/mL) and that the antioxidant activity of the nanoemulsions was relatively low with higher IC
 <sub>50</sub> (47.87, 754.67, and 257.86 µg/mL) towards DPPH free radical–scavenging, CUPRAC, and ABTS assays, respectively, compared with TROLOX and ascorbic acid which were used as positive control (

 <italic>S. satureioides</italic> oil at different harvest periods and extracted from plants cultivated in Djelfa, Algeria [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-25-04756" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Due to the important role of phenolic and flavonoid compounds in exhibiting antioxidant effects, the total contents of both classes were analyzed. The HD oil had the highest phenolic and flavonoid contents and therefore exhibited more effective radical scavengers than nanoemulsions. The findings of this study showed that the major constituents of HD oils and their nanoemulsions are oxygenated monoterpenes, and they are especially known for their antioxidant activity with respect to the synergistic interaction between the phenolic content and other components in the essential oil, which was possibly responsible for the difference in the activity observed [

 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-04756" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The antioxidant activity of oxygenated monoterpenes, including thymol, carvacrol, α—terpineol, borneol, terpene-4-ol, and linalool detected in the present study is due to the presence of phenolic nuclei (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04756-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Mohamadi et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-04756" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] identified 17 phenolic compounds and flavonoids during the investigation of chloroform, butanol, and ethyl acetate extracts of 
 <italic>S. satureioides</italic> Coss. et Durieu using liquid chromatography, whereas caffeic acid and quercetin were the most active components of different antioxidant assays applied.
