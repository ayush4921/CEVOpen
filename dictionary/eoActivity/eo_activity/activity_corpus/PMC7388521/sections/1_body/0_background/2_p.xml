<p id="Par23">By realizing the above issue, the Chinese government started to establish the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (ChP) in 1950, and 65 medicaments from plant origins, oils and fats were included in the first edition of ChP (1953 edition). Then, in the second edition (1963 edition) of ChP, TCM was officially organized in Volume I and it was separated from chemical drugs since then. Through years of revisions, the 2020 edition of ChP is the 11th edition of ChP containing 2711 monographs of TCM. On the other hand, European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines &amp; Health Care (EDQM) has started to work on quality control monographs for herbal drugs in European Pharmacopoeia (EP) since 1997. But it was not until 2005, a working program for TCM had been started. The objective of the program is to construct TCM monographs in EP according to the EP’s herbal drugs quality control principles. A special Working Party on TCM constituted by a group of experts and specialists from Europe been formed since 2008 and later on scientists from Asia also joined this working group, to work on a list of TCM candidates with a scheduled working progress [

Names of herbal drugs used in traditional Chinese medicine”, other herbal drugs such as Ginkgo leaf and St. John’s wort are still considered to be European herbal drugs in EP because of their long history of application in Europe. Since the quality control systems of herbal drugs in Europe and China are different, monographs of TCM are different in the two pharmacopoeias as well. Additional file

Moreover, with more and more studies on TCM quality, new findings of sophisticated analytical techniques have been reported, which may be beneficial in constructing TCM quality control monographs.
