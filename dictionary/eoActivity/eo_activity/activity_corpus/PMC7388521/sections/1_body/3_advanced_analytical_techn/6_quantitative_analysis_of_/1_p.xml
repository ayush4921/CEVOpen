<p id="Par48">It is known that the efficacy of TCM is contributed by their multi-components or in their combinations. Thus multi-components determination has been commonly accepted as the effective way for the quality control of TCM. But the major obstacles of the approach are the lack of commercial available CRS and the high costs involved. In order to resolve the problem, QAMS method that could accurately determine the contents of multiple constituents by using a single compound has been proposed. It uses a commercially available and cheap CRS as the internal standard, then the peaks of other compounds could be identified by relative retention time and the contents could be calculated by the validated relative correction factor [

QAMS method has been adopted in several monographs in both pharmacopoeias, such as Andrographis Herba, Aucklandiae Radix and Evodiae Fructus in EP, as well as Andrographis Herba, Coptidis Rhizoma and Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma in ChP. It has also been widely used for multi-components quantification of TCM, including Scutellariae Radix [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>], Gastrodiae Rhizoma [
