<p id="Par47">Nowadays, HS extraction and utilization of MS are widely studied in GC analysis of herbal drugs, and coupling with solid-phase microextraction (SPME) could further enhance the performance, availability and sensitivity of GC analysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. In this technique, the sample is usually heated to make the volatile compounds be transferred to gas phase and then are injected to GC (static HS) or extracted by sorbent (HS-SPME). It has simplified isolation, extraction and concentration in GC analysis into one step, which will require less samples and no organic solvents in analysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. HS-GC has been used for residual solvents in both EP and ChP. However, due to its limitation in precision and accuracy, it is more applied to qualitative or relative quantitative analysis of volatile components in herb drugs. Huang et al. used HS-SPME–GC–MS to identify 46 compounds and relatively determine four major volatile components in Zingiberis Rhizoma with different drying methods [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Chen et al. separated and relatively quantified 63 volatile compounds, with 53 being identified from three
