<p id="Par49">Fingerprints are becoming more and more important in quality control especially in authentication and identification of TCM because of their complexity. Using fingerprint could reflect integral characterization of herbal drugs and offer the possibility for TCM quality control in a holistic manner, which is consistent with the principle of traditional Chinese medicine [

ChP has included “characteristic chromatogram” or “fingerprint” tests in some TCM and TCM’s oil, fat and extractives as well, e.g. Aquilariae Lignum Resinatum, Dendrobii Caulis, Gastrodiae Rhizoma, Notopterygii Rhizoma et Radix, Lonicerae Japonicae Flos, Notoginseng Total Saponins, and Salvia Total Phenolic Acids. Hong Kong Chinese Materia Medica Standards has also included HPLC fingerprint for TCM authentication, and a typical chromatogram is presented in the monograph of each TCM. Nowadays, fingerprint could be generated by various analytical techniques including TLC, HPLC/UHPLC, GC, infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, etc. The combination of chemometric methods such as similarity analysis, principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis can make full use of the component information of fingerprints, which is beneficial to the overall quality control of TCM. Lu et al. established HPLC fingerprint coupled with similarity, hierarchical clustering, and principal component analyses to evaluate the quality of raw and processed Corydalis Rhizoma from different origins [
