<p id="Par25">Herbal drugs and most of TCM materia medica are derived from plants, thus the origin of TCM usually consist of their botanical sources and medicinal parts. In both pharmacopoeias, origin of the herbal drugs including botanical sources, medicinal parts and their status is specifically stated in the “Definition” section (EP) or at the beginning of each monograph (ChP). A comparison of TCM with different botanical sources and/or medicinal parts is summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. From the table, the most apparent difference is the frequent inclusion of multi-species and/or subspecies for one TCM in ChP. Although EP might also include several botanical origins for one TCM, such as Akebiae Caulis, Coptidis Rhizoma and Piperis Longi Fructus, such cases are not found as frequently as those in ChP. Inclusion of multiple species could be dated back in ancient practice of TCM for many reasons, which may due to different practice between regions and doctors, plant distribution between places, substitution of one species to another, or revision in prescription over time etc. However, significant differences in the chemical profiles may exist between different species of TCM, posing possible quality issues in TCM application. For example, there are three botanical sources of Coptidis Rhizoma stated in both EP and ChP: 
 <italic>Coptis chinensis</italic>, 
 <italic>Coptis deltoidea</italic> and 
 <italic>Coptis teeta</italic>. It was shown that the three species had significant differences in their phytochemical profile, particularly with regard to the pharmacologically active alkaloids [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Another example is Uncariae Ramulus cum Uncis, EP states that its botanical source is 
 <italic>Uncaria rhynchophylla</italic>, but there are five botanical sources in ChP: 
 <italic>Uncaria rhynchophylla</italic>, 
 <italic>Uncaria macrophylla</italic>, 
 <italic>Uncaria hirsute</italic>, 
 <italic>Uncaria sinensis</italic> and 
 <italic>Uncaria sessilifructus</italic>. The genetic analysis based on rDNA ITS sequences showed that 
 <italic>Uncaria rhynchophylla</italic>, 
 <italic>Uncaria sinensis</italic> and 
 <italic>Uncaria hirsute</italic> were closely related to each other but were far away from 
 <italic>Uncaria macrophylla</italic> and 
 <italic>Uncaria sessilifructus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The chromatographic fingerprint showed that significant difference could be observed among the five 
 <italic>Uncaria</italic> species, yet there were also some similarities between each other [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. As mentioned above, there are reasons to include several species and subspecies for one TCM in the monographs, but it brings more difficulty and challenges for the quality control and pharmacological study.
