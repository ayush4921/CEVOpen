<p id="Par36">When TCM is stored under suitable temperature and humidity conditions for microorganisms, fungi and molds may grow in TCM and generate a large group of secondary metabolic products called mycotoxins. Mycotoxins consist of many categories including aflatoxin, ochratoxin, zearalenone, etc. and have hazardous effects to human body such as hepatic cell and tissue injury, reproductive disorders and diarrhea etc. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Thus, both EP and ChP have included tests to control the mycotoxins level for TCM. Generally, EP chapter “2.8.18 Determination of aflatoxin B
 <sub>1</sub> in herbal drugs” and “2.8.22 Determination of ochratoxin A in herbal drugs” require herbal drugs subjected to contamination by aflatoxins B
 <sub>1</sub> or ochratoxin A should be tested by a validated method, and give the limit of aflatoxin B
 <sub>1</sub> (aflatoxin B
 <sub>1</sub> ≤ 2 µg/kg, sum of G
 <sub>2</sub>, G
 <sub>1</sub>, B
 <sub>2</sub> and B
 <sub>1</sub> ≤ 4 µg/kg). Special limit for the two mycotoxins may be required if necessary (e.g. ochratoxin A in Liquiritiae Radix ≤ 20 μg/kg). ChP also requires some herbal drugs to have their mycotoxin content determined, and of the herbal drugs reviewed, Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium, Coicis Semen, Corydalis Rhizoma and Polygalae Radix are required to test their aflatoxins (aflatoxin B
 <sub>1</sub> ≤ 5 µg/kg, sum of G
 <sub>2</sub>, G
 <sub>1</sub>, B
 <sub>2</sub> and B
 <sub>1</sub> ≤ 10 µg/kg), Coicis Semen is required to test its zearalenone (≤ 500 µg/kg). For mycotoxins determination, EP applies LC-fluorescence detection to determine the levels of aflatoxins B
 <sub>1</sub> and ochratoxin A in TCM, while in ChP general chapter “2351 Determination of mycotoxins”, LC and/or LC–MS are specified to determine the mycotoxins in TCM, including aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, zearalenone, deoxynivalenol, patulin, etc. Additionally, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay can also be used for aflatoxins determination.
