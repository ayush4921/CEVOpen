<p id="Par31">In both pharmacopoeias, different tests are required to detect different contaminations and adulterants according to the nature of each TCM. EP has a general monograph named “Herbal drugs” and required tests are listed in the monograph, including foreign matter, loss on drying, water, pesticides, heavy metals, total ash, ash insoluble in hydrochloric acid, extractable matter, swelling index, bitterness value, aflatoxin B
 <sub>1</sub>, ochratoxin A, radioactive contamination and microbial contamination. Each test is cross-referred to other chapters of EP which specify the analytical methods. General requirements of foreign matter and heavy metals are included in this general monograph, and general limits of pesticides and aflatoxin B
 <sub>1</sub>, are given in the monographs of corresponding analytical methods. ChP also has a general chapter entitled “0212 General principle for inspection of crude drugs and decoction pieces” requiring the tests for the content of water, ash, foreign matters, poisonous ingredients, heavy metals, harmful elements, pesticides residues, aflatoxins, etc., and gives the general limits of the content of water, foreign matter, sulfur dioxide and pesticides. The relevant methods are provided in a series of general chapters under the catalogue “2000 Special methods for traditional Chinese medicines”. Besides the above differences in the general monograph, some other differences are also found when comparing the “Tests” section in TCM monographs between EP and ChP, which should be taken into consideration in quality control of TCM.
