<p id="Par35">In TCM production, TCM may be fumigated with sulfur as post-harvest process. Sulfur fumigation could have beneficial effects on TCM including preservation and better appearance but it also generates problems such as sulfur dioxide and heavy metal residues and changes in the chemical profile in TCM [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Since sulfur fumigation is an effective, low cost and traditional processing method in TCM production, many TCM crude drugs may go through sulfur fumigation before going to the market, which may cause toxicity to consumers, decrease in TCM quality and give rise to counterfeiting in the market, therefore determination of sulfur dioxide residue is necessary in order to prevent irrational use of sulfur fumigation in TCM production. In comparison, sulfur dioxide residue is not required in EP, but it is required in ChP that limit of sulfur dioxide residue generally do not exceed 150 mg/kg except mineral drugs, and 400 mg/kg for 10 particular TCM including Achyranthis Bidentatae Radix, Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma, Codonopsis Radix, Dioscoreae Rhizoma, Gastrodiae Rhizoma, Paeoniae Radix Alba and Puerariae Thomsonii Radix, etc. In terms of determination method, ChP general chapter “2331 Determination of residue of sulfur dioxide” employs acid–base titration, GC and ion chromatography to determine the sulfur dioxide residue in TCM, quality control conductor may choose the appropriate method to determine the sulfur dioxide residue in TCM.
