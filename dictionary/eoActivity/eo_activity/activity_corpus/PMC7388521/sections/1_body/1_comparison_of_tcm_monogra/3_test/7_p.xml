<p id="Par37">“Extractable matter” in EP or “Extractives” in ChP determines the content of substances in TCM extracts using different solvents such as water, ethanol and ether. However, instead of a requirement in “Test” section, “Extractives” in ChP is separated from “Test” as an individual item in the monographs. Furthermore, of the 73 TCM reviewed, EP only requires 5 TCM to have their extractable matter determined (Acanthopanacis Gracilistyli Cortex, Codonopsis Radix, Dioscoreae Oppositifoliae Rhizoma, Lycii Fructus and Poria), all without assay requirements in the monographs; on the other hand, a total of 50 TCM in ChP need to determine their content of extractives, while the majority of them also have assay quantification in their monographs. The reason of EP not to include extractable matter in certain monographs is because extractable matter determination is useful only to TCM without a component suitable for an assay or TCM used to produce a preparation with a dry residue [

The methods used to determine extractable matter or extractives in both pharmacopoeias are very similar: certain amount of TCM is extracted with specific solvent, then the filtrate is evaporated to dryness and the residue is weighed to calculate the percentage of the extracts. However, EP does not have a general chapter for extractable matter, and methods are included only in corresponding monographs with stated limits for particular TCM; ChP on the other hand includes general chapter “2201 Determination of extractives” and three types of extractives including water, ethanol and volatile ether are described.
