<p id="Par38">Besides TCM identification and different quality tests, one of the most important quality indicators for TCM is the content of active components, which is assessed in “Assay” in both pharmacopoeias. But EP and ChP may apply different techniques to assess the active components of TCM, and sometimes “Assay” may be absent if feasible technique is not available. A comparison of the methods is listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>. The numbers of different analytical methods applied in “Assay” section for herbal drugs in both EP and ChP are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. It is shown that HPLC remains the most applied analytical method in TCM assay, followed by essential oil determination, ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy (UV–Vis) and GC. HPLC in TCM assay has many advantages, such as high separation efficiency, wide range of application, good reproducibility, accuracy and short analysis time. Thus, HPLC is the most preferred techniques in TCM assay. Among the 73 TCM reviewed, 57 in EP and 60 in ChP employ HPLC for “Assay”. While for volatile components determination, GC possesses many advantages over LC and therefore is used more often in herbal drugs with high content of volatile compounds. For example, Amomi Fructus, Amomi Fructus Rotundus, Foeniculi Fructus and Anisi Stellati Fructus all include GC analysis for “Assay” in both pharmacopoeias. Besides LC and GC, UV–Vis is another quantification technique used to determine a specific group of components with high degree of conjugation or can be highly conjugated after derivatization. Among the “Assay” of the 73 TCM monographs, 6 in EP and 5 in ChP apply UV–Vis method to determine flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins, etc. in the herbal drugs, showing that although many active components determination has been done by LC and GC, UV–Vis spectroscopy is still useful in quality control of TCMs, especially for TCMs without applicable chromatographic analysis.
