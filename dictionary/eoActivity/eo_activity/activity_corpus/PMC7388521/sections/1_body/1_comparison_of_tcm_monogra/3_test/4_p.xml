<p id="Par34">Heavy metals may accumulate in TCM during production, causing symptoms such as anaemia, pains or organ failure to TCM users, thus heavy metals content should be strictly controlled in TCM [

EP chapter “2.4.27 Heavy metals in herbal drugs and herbal drug preparation” has included determination methods for arsenic, cadmium, copper, mercury, nickel and lead. The limits for herbal drugs in EP are as follow: cadmium (≤ 1.0 ppm), lead (≤ 5.0 ppm), mercury (≤ 0.1 ppm), but special requirements may be needed for some herbal drugs such as Lini Semen (cadmium ≤ 0.5 ppm). As for ChP, “Heavy metals and harmful elements” are required only in some monographs (Angelicae Dahuricae Radix, Angelicae Sinensis Radix, Astragali Radix, Gardeniae Fructus, Lycii Fructus, Notoginseng Radix et Rhizoma, Paeoniae Radix Alba, Puerariae Lobatae Radix, Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, etc.) and cross-referred to general chapter “2321 Determination of lead, cadmium, arsenic, mercury and copper”, with limit of each element stated in each monograph (usually as follow: lead ≤ 5 mg/kg, cadmium ≤ 1 mg/kg, arsenic ≤ 2 mg/kg, mercury ≤ 0.2 mg/kg, copper ≤ 20 mg/kg). Atomic absorption spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma (ICP)-MS are introduced in this general chapter as the determination methods of heavy metals content in TCM, which are the mostly applied methods in heavy metal determination nowadays [

 <sub>50</sub> values of different arsenic species in rat are different, the most toxic species would be arsine with LD
 <sub>50</sub> of 3.0 mg/kg, but monomethylarsonic acid and dimethylarsinic acid would be considered “non-toxic” with LD
 <sub>50</sub> between 700 and 2600 mg/kg [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Therefore, it is important to identify the forms of heavy metals in TCM to rationally assess the potential hazard of inorganic impurities in TCM. ChP general chapter “2322 Determination of mercury and arsenic speciation and their valence states” has specified HPLC–ICP-MS to determine the species of arsenic and mercury in TCM. The method is now the most applied method in heavy metal speciation and has been applied in different TCM for heavy metal speciation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. But still, heavy metal speciation is only required for Cinnabaris (mercuric sulfide) and Realgar (arsenic disulfide) in ChP. Therefore, further research is needed to generate more data and knowledge in this area in order to develop advanced and rational inorganic impurities regulations for TCM.
