<p id="Par26">In addition, Latin synonyms in pharmacopoeias could be an issue for identification of botanical origins of TCM. An analysis showed that at least 16.13% Latin names of TCM in ChP (2010 edition) were not in accordance with Flora of China and the reasons of the issue may include: repeat naming of the same species; synonyms of the families; new definitions of species and families; as well as traditional use of old Latin names [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Among the 73 TCM reviewed, 24 entries have Latin synonyms stated in EP, and some other TCM without annotation may also have Latin synonyms. For example, botanical origins of Sinomenii Caulis in ChP include 
 <italic>Sinomenium acutum</italic> (Thunb.) Rehd. et Wils. or 
 <italic>Sinomenium acutum (Thunb.)</italic> Rehd. et Wils. var. 
 <italic>cinereum</italic> Rehd. et Wils. But in fact, the latter is synonym of the former, and the former is the botanical origin stated in EP, thus the botanical origin of Sinomenii Caulis in both pharmacopoeias is actually the same. Therefore, when determining the botanical origins of TCM, Latin synonyms is still an issue that should be addressed.
