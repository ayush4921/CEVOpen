<p id="Par32">In quality assessment of TCM, moisture content is an important issue because inappropriate moisture would facilitate microbes’ growth, resulting in decomposition or toxin generation in TCM. Therefore “Loss on drying” or “Water” is often required in the monograph to determine TCM’s moisture content. However, even though “Water” and “Loss on drying” seem to be very similar, they are different not only in their method, but also what they convey in the monographs. “Loss on drying” determines the weight loss of TCM during specific condition such as heating or vacuum, which may include water and volatile contents in TCM, while “Water” determines only the moisture in TCM. Usually, the result of “Loss on drying” and “Water” will be the same for TCM with no or little volatile substances. But significant difference in the results may happen when applying different methods to determine the TCM containing high volatile content [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. A comparison of the methods for moisture determination in the two pharmacopoeias is summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. There is only little difference between the methods of “Loss on drying”, but major differences could be found in “Water”. EP has only included toluene distillation in the method, but ChP has also included Karl-Fischer titration, drying in oven, drying under reduced pressure and GC as well. When comparing the frequency of different methods for TCM moisture determination, drying in oven method is the most applied. Among the 73 TCM reviewed, 66 in EP and 51 in ChP employ this method. Furthermore, 7 TCM monographs in EP and 13 in ChP use toluene distillation method, mainly based on the volatile content of the TCM, since EP states that toluene distillation method instead of drying in oven or in vacuo should be carried out for herbal drugs with high essential oil content, ChP also states that drying in oven method should be used for crude drugs with little or no volatile constituents. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> shows the differences in the methods between the two pharmacopoeias with the TCM’s essential oil contents for reference. A typical example would be Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma, limit for “Water” in EP and ChP are 10% (100 mL/kg) and 15%, respectively. The significant difference in the standard may mainly due to the difference in the methods, because the essential oil content of Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma should be no less than 9 mL/kg according to EP. Furthermore, parameters of the methods applied in pharmacopoeias may also have impact on the result. EP specifies drying process to be 105 °C usually for certain hours, while ChP requires the sample to be dried until the difference between two successive weighings is not more than 5 mg, thus residual in moisture may affect the result and standard of certain TCM, such as Bupleuri Radix (EP: 5%; ChP: 10%), Isatidis Radix (EP: 9%; ChP: 15%) and Schisandrae Chinensis Fructus (EP: 10%; ChP: 16%) (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). Therefore, consideration should be taken when using either “Loss on drying” or “Water” for a specific TCM, because different results may be obtained when using different methods to determine the moisture content in TCM.
