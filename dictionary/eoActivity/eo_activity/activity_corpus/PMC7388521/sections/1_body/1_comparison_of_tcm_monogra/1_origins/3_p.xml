<p id="Par27">In the application of TCM, herbs could be applied either as in whole plant, or as in different parts of the plant such as aerial parts, underground parts, root, rhizome, stem, bark, leaf or flower. Furthermore, active constituents and harmful constituents may be varied in different parts of an herb. Therefore, it is very important to specify the medicinal parts in quality standard of TCM. By comparing the stated medicinal parts of TCM between the two pharmacopoeias, most are the same except few such as Ephedrae Herba and Sanguisorbae Radix (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). But the differences in these TCM are small, such as underground parts instead of root, thus little or no influence would be generated under the circumstances.
