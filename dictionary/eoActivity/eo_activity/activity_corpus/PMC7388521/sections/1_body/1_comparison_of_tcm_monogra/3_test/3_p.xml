<p id="Par33">Pesticides are substances used to prevent, destroy or control pest, unwanted plants or animals during the production of herbal drugs. Pesticides may remain in the TCM if inappropriate approach is conducted during production, which will become pesticides residues and could be potential toxins to consumers. Therefore, EP requires pesticide residue test for herbal drugs and it is cross-referred to chapter “2.8.13 Pesticides residues”. A list consisted of 69 pesticides’ limits is included in the chapter, limits of other pesticides are cross-referred to Regulation (EC) No. 396/2005 or calculated by acceptable daily intake amount, body weight and daily dose of the herbal drug. Although there is no specification on the methods, analysis must be validated according to the requirements stated in chapter 2.8.13. In ChP, general chapter “2341 Determination of pesticide residues” specifies GC, GC–mass spectrometry (MS) or LC–MS techniques to determine the pesticide residues in TCM. The chapter includes several categories of pesticides to be determined (organochlorine, organophosphorous, pyrethrin, etc.) and each has a detail description of determination method and a list of pesticides and their retention time, limit of detection etc. as guidance for quality control performers. The limits of 33 pesticides are given in the general chapter “0212 General principle for inspection of crude drugs and decoction pieces”, and special requirements are included for some herbal drugs, such as Astragali Radix, Ginseng Radix et Rhizoma and Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma (Additional file
