<p id="p0210">By the Scanning electron microscopy, 
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> was shown that the different concentrations tested of essential oils had a positive impact in extending the shelf-life of chrysanthemum cut flowers compared with the control (distilled water). The blockage of xylem led to water stress, which recorded the limiting factor of cut flowers' prolonging and expression as early wilting of flowers and leaves. The cross-section in 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> A and B indicates the xylem cells in the control (distilled water) neighborhood of cut were filled with bacteria. As a result of this blockage, the cut flowers would lose their turgidity and decrease the chrysanthemum's vase-life cut flowers. In contrast, the treatments with 500 mg/l thyme oil and 250 mg/l clove oils show a prime state of xylem vessels.
