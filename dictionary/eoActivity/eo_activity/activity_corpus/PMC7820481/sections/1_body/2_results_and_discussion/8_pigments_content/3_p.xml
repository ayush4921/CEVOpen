 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Lise et al. (2004)</xref> reported that the increase in chlorophyll pigments increases cell activity and increases sugar. Many researchers also explained the maintenance or elicitation of chlorophyll when the essential oils dissolved in a vase solution because of the antioxidant properties of these oils (
