 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ (2)</xref> indicated that most of the vase solutions used significantly gave the greatest RFW% of chrysanthemum cut flowers compared with the control (distilled water), which had the lowest RFW% of cut flowers in two seasons (47.14 and 42.45%, respectively). Whereas, the heavier values of RFW% of cut flowers recorded in the vase solution containing 500 mg/l thyme oil on both seasons (79.89 and 70.37 %, respectively) followed by the cut flowers kept in a preserved solution containing 400 mg/l thyme oil (77.41 and 65.02 %, respectively) compared to the control (distilled water) and the other concentrations of EOs tested in the preserved solutions.
