<p id="p0125">The effect of the different concentrations of thyme and clove essential oils as preservatives in holding (vase) solutions on the diameter of head flowers and stem were determined individually, and the data are shown in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure (1)</xref>. The diameters of both head flowers and stem were significantly increased with the groups treated with 500 mg/l thyme oil and 250 mg/l clove oil dissolved in preserved solution during the two tested seasons compared with the control (distilled water). The least means of the diameters of both flower head and stem were found on the preservative solution fortified with 500 mg/l clove oil. In contrast, the highest means of the diameters of both flowers head and stem was observed on the vase solution containing 500 mg/l of thyme oil compared with the control and the other concentrations of thyme and clove oils. These findings are in the same line with the study of 
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Hashemi et al. (2013)</xref>, who demonstrated that the preserved solution containing thymol at 75 and 125 mg/l increased the flower head diameter of cut chrysanthemum. It may explain our result as one of the important phenolic compounds found in thyme oil is thymol.
