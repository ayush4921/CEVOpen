The chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and carotenoids of chrysanthemum recorded the highest concentrations in the groups treated with 500 mg/l thyme dissolved in the keeping solution (6.89, 2.37, and 5.99 mg/g FW, respectively) compared to the control and other treatments. Similarly, the contents of the tested pigments were significantly increased in cut flowers treated with 250 mg/l clove oil treated groups. Oppositely, the lowest contents of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and carotenoids were obtained with the vase solution containing 400 mg/l thyme oil, which gave 2.25, 0.81, and 1.21 mg/g FW, respectively.
