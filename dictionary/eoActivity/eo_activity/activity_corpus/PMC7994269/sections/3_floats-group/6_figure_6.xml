  <p>Bacterial growth on skin mucus of juvenile gilthead seabream (
   <italic>Sparus aurata</italic>) fed a diet supplemented with a blend of garlic essential oil, carvacrol and thymol, and a control diet devoid of the feed additive. Mucus samples were obtained from 3 pools of 6 individual fish. Data correspond to the mean Â± SEM of triplicate bacterial growth curves of 
   <italic>V. anguillarum</italic>
   <bold>(A)</bold>, 
   <italic>P. anguilliseptica</italic>
   <bold>(C)</bold> and 
   <italic>E. coli</italic>
   <bold>(E)</bold>. Gray circles correspond to bacteria growth in medium devoid of mucus; purple squares correspond to bacteria growth in the mucus of fish fed the control diet; and green rhombus correspond to bacteria growth in the mucus of fish fed the phytogenic-supplemented diet. Details on the statistical differences in bacterial growth between the experimental dietary groups is provided by the percentage of decrease in growth of 
   <italic>V. anguillarum</italic>
   <bold>(B)</bold>, 
   <italic>P. anguilliseptica</italic>
   <bold>(D)</bold>, and 
   <italic>E. coli</italic>
   <bold>(F)</bold>. Asterisks indicate significant differences in bacterial growth between dietary groups (
   <italic>t</italic>-test, 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05).
