  <p>Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways networks of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the skin of juvenile gilthead seabream (
   <italic>Sparus aurata</italic>) fed a diet supplemented with a blend of garlic essential oil, carvacrol and thymol. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Gray cores represent the KEGG pathways significantly impacted by the DEGs obtained from the skin of fish fed the phytogenic-supplemented diet. Green-shaded nodes represent up-regulated genes and red-shaded nodes represent down-regulated genes. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Nodes colors indicate the KEGG pathways for each DEG represented within the overall transcripteractome. Pathways description, count of DEGs within each pathway and respective false discovery rate are described in the graphical figure legend. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Interactions exclusively among the DEGs within each KEGG pathway. Nodes colors indicate the KEGG pathways for each DEG represented. Pathways description, count of DEGs within each pathway and respective false discovery rate are described in the graphical figure legend. Green-shaded nodes represent up-regulated genes and red-shaded nodes represent down-regulated genes. For details, please refers to
