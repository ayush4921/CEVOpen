  <p>Functional biological network of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) recognized by their involvement in the immune response in the skin of juvenile gilthead seabream (
   <italic>Sparus aurata</italic>) fed a diet supplemented with a blend of garlic essential oil, carvacrol, and thymol. Green-shaded nodes represent up-regulated genes and red-shaded nodes represent down-regulated genes. Graphic keys and network stats: number of nodes = 30; number of edges = 24; average node degree = 1.6; average local clustering coefficient = 0.4; expected number of edges = 9; PPI enrichment 
   <italic>p</italic>-value = 1.25e-05. Gene Ontology (GO) definition, count of DEGs within the biological process and respective false discovery rate are described in the graphical figure legend (bottom left). For details, please refers to 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>. Gene description, respective acronym, fold-change intensity (FC), modulation (color scale), and P-value are described (right).
