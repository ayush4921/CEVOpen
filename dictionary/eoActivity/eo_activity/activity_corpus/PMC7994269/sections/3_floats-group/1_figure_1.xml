  <p>Skin transcriptomic profile of gilthead seabream (
   <italic>Sparus aurata</italic>) fed a diet supplemented with a blend of garlic essential oil, carvacrol and thymol. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Differential expression analysis of the gilthead seabream skin transcriptomic response fed a diet supplemented with a blend of garlic, carvacrol and thymol. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Hierarchical clustering for the control and phytogenic-supplemented diets, based in similitude patterns of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) detected from three sample pools per dietary group. Data of the six microarrays are depicted, one for each represented pool. Both increased and decreased gene expression pattern is shown in green and red, respectively. All transcripts represented are statistically significant (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Principal component analysis (PCA) of the DEGs of gilthead seabream skin response to the control diet (yellow) and phytogenic-supplemented diet (pink). Please refers to 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table 1</xref> for details.
