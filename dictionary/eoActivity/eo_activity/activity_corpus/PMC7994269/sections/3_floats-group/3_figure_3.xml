 <caption>
  <p>Functional network representing cellular components related to secretory pathways of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the skin of juvenile gilthead seabream (
   <italic>Sparus aurata</italic>) fed a diet supplemented with a blend of garlic essential oil, carvacrol and thymol. Node colors indicate the cellular component for each DEG represented. Green-shaded nodes represent up-regulated genes and red-shaded nodes represent down-regulated genes. Graphic keys and network stats: number of nodes = 203; number of edges = 341; average node degree = 3.36; average local clustering coefficient = 0.4; expected number of edges = 286; PPI enrichment 
   <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.000807. Gene Ontology (GO) definition, count of DEGs within the biological process and respective false discovery rate are described in the graphical figure legend (bottom). For details, please refers to
