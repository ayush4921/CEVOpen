<p>Therefore, the improvement of both the epidermal mucus composition and the SALT response to environmental stressors including infective agents by means of dietary tools such as functional feed additives, represents a promising approach for preventing bacterial-induced pathologies in farmed fish. In this context, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the inclusion of a functional feed additive composed by a blend of garlic essential oil, carvacrol, and thymol (the main bioactive compounds of Labiateae plants essential oils) in a standard on-growing diet for gilthead seabream (
 <italic>Sparus aurata</italic>), assessing its effects on the skin transcriptional response, pathogenic bacterial growth capacity in skin mucus, and fish overall health condition. This species was chosen since it is the most important marine farmed fish species in the Mediterranean with an annual production of 85,385.1 t in 2018 and an economic value of 502,398,000 US$ (
