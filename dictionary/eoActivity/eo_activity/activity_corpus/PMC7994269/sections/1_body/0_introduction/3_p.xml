<p>One of the main targets for this type of nutritional strategies is the mucosal tissues, due to their importance in the protection against the immediate contact with the environment and potential pathogens. Besides acting as a physical barrier, the mucosal layer also offers a biochemical shield, in which elements from both the innate and acquired immunity are present (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). In particular, the fish skin mucus represents the largest mucosal barrier with its whole epidermis directly exposed to the environment. It is responsible for the first line of defense against external threats, determining pathogen adhesion to the epithelial surfaces (

 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Furthermore, skin mucus participates in important physiological processes like osmoregulation, swimming, sensory reception (

 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In fact, the immune response described in fish skin against antigen stimulation is similar to other mucosa (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). That immune response involves the secretion of innate immune molecules and the action of specialized cells [(
