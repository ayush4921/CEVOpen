<p>Fish professional phagocytes include macrophages, granulocytes, dendritic cells and B cells, and as for other vertebrates, phagocytosis in fish is recognized as a critical component of the innate and adaptive immune responses against pathogens, known to elicit several antimicrobial mechanisms. Under this context, the KEGG “Phagosome” pathway obtained from our functional analysis suggests the modulation of phagocytic events by the administered phytogenics. For instance, despite the extracellular roles of cathepsins (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>), these proteins are mainly found in endolysosomal structures where they are crucial for protein degradation and Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class II mediated immune responses (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). Interestingly, the MHC Class II Alpha gene (
 <italic>mhc-IIa</italic>) was the second most up-regulated gene in the skin of fish fed the phytogenic-supplemented diet. While MHC-IIa protein was identified in gilthead seabream skin mucus proteome (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), the main function of fish MHC Class II molecules is to present the peptides generated in the endolysosomal structure on the cell surface of B cells and phagocytes for their recognition by the CD4+ T cells (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). In fact, the gilthead seabream acidophilic granulocytes, considered the main professional phagocytic cell type for this fish species, were demonstrated to show high 
 <italic>mhc-IIa</italic> gene expression (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). Moreover, they have also proved to have phagocytic activity against bacterial pathogens such 
 <italic>V. anguillarum</italic> (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>), being able to release antimicrobial peptides into the phagosome of the ingested pathogenic bacteria (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). The “leukocyte activation”, “regulation of T cell proliferation”, and “antigen processing and presentation of exogenous peptide antigen via MHC class I” biological processes obtained from our enrichment analysis, might suggest the activity of acidophilic granulocytes and/or other immune cells in the skin of gilthead seabream fed the functional diet. Similarly, previous transcriptional results on the effect of the same functional feed additive in gilthead seabream mucosal tissues such gills (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) suggested the recruitment and activation of acidophilic granulocytes as a consequence of the immunostimulatory effect of this additive.
