<p>Collectively, these data clearly suggest a relationship between the tested phytogenics, the increased skin innate immunity and a cortisol-mediated response, promoting the overall animal welfare. In fact, according to the only biological process significantly regulated among the experimental diets, the RNA processing biological process, several genes implicated in ribosomal proteins synthesis (
 <italic>riok1, rcl1, rrp1, nop56, nsa2, tsr2</italic>) were mainly up-regulated in fish fed the phytogenic-supplemented diet. Since ribosome biogenesis is the cell's most costly process in terms of energy expenditure, this process must be tightly regulated in order to avoid wasted energy (
 <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>). Consequently, the up-regulation of such genes could be suggesting less stressed cells able to direct their energy into this process. Since skin from the control group appear to be more susceptible to be colonized by pathogenic bacterial strains, it could be spending more energy in defense mechanisms and bacterial clearance than fish fed the phytogenic-supplemented diet.
