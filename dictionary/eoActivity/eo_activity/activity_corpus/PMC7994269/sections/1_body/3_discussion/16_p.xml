<p>Moreover, the 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, a non-pathogenic bacterium for fish, was also used as an indicator of the potential antibacterial capacity of the skin mucus, neglecting a potentially acquired immunization. Although no significant differences were observed among the experimental diets, a decreasing trend in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> growth was observed due to the presence of mucus from both dietary groups in the culture medium. Interestingly, garlic-supplemented diets caused a significant increase in the Caspian roach fry skin mucus antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> when compared to the control group (

 <italic>in vitro</italic> activity against most Gram positive and negative bacteria, including 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (

 <italic>E. coli</italic> growth in our study could be suggesting the promotion of the skin innate immunity against fish pathogens (
