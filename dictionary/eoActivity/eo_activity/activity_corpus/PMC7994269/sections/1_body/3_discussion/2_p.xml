<p>In the present study, we evaluated the protective benefits of a blend of dietary garlic essential oil, carvacrol, and thymol on gilthead seabream in terms of skin transcriptome and skin mucus secretions. The potential increased skin mucus protective capacity observed in our gilthead seabream fed with phytogenic-supplemented diet could be attributed to the exudation of a variety of biologically active substances and several molecules of the innate and acquired immune system. In fact, many of them have an already reported biostatic and biocidal activities (

 <italic>h3f3a</italic>) was up-regulated in the skin of fish fed the phytogenic-supplemented diet. Histones, full-length proteins and/or fragments, are recognized antimicrobial molecules (

 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Calpain 1 (
 <italic>capn1</italic>), a non-lysosomal cysteine protease, was observed to be up-regulated by the functional additive as well. Several calpain proteins were mapped in gilthead seabream's epidermal mucus (
