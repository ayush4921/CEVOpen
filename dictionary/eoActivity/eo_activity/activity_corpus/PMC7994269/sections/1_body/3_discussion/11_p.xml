<p>In order to prevent the stable colonization of potential pathogens, mucus is continuously synthesized, secreted and replaced (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). This continuous regulation of mucus secretions represents one of the first barriers against potential pathogens and toxins (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Accordingly, our functional analysis determined the modulation of the KEGG “Protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum” pathway and several cellular components connected to the secretory pathway, such as transport vesicles, Golgi-associated vesicles and vacuoles. The regulation of the secretory machinery could be supporting the active biosynthesis and release of immune-related factors on the skin mucus that would mediate in the response observed in our study. The mucus secretion is a complex process that represents the endpoint of the interaction between the innate immune system, endocytosis and autophagy events, ROS generation and mucin secretion (
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>). From the immunological point of view, cytokines, and chemokines are molecules trafficked in secretory granules and vesicles through secretory pathways in immune cells (
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>) that could be also involved in the response observed. Under this context, transcripts of the pro-inflammatory cytokine Interleukin 1 Beta (
 <italic>il-1</italic>β) were observed to be increased in the skin of fish fed the phytogenic-supplemented diet. In fish, IL-1β is a recognized chemoattractant for leukocytes (
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>). Additionally, the Aminoacyl tRNA Synthetase Complex Interacting Multifunctional Protein 1 (
 <italic>aimp1</italic>) gene was also up-regulated. Secreted AIMP1 possesses inflammatory cytokine activity responsible for activating monocytes and inducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, mainly the Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) (
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>). In accordance, genes that are activated in response to the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF, such the TNF Alpha Induced Protein 2 (
 <italic>tnfaip2</italic>) and TNFAIP3-Interacting Protein 2 (
 <italic>tnip2</italic>) were also up-regulated by the phytogenics in our study. The last inhibits the NF-kB pathway activation (
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>), negatively regulating the transcription of other pro-inflammatory cytokines and, consequently, controlling the inflammatory response. Thus, such response could be intimately related with the role of AIMP1 in dermal fibroblast proliferation and wound repair (
