<p>In summary, our analysis of the skin transcriptional profiling as well as the skin mucus biomarkers and lower pathogenic bacterial growth capacity revealed a multifactorial response to the dietary administration of garlic essential oil, carvacrol, and thymol, mainly through the transcriptional regulation of factors of the innate immunity and the stimulation of the secretory pathway. Our results suggest that the phytogenic-supplemented diet induces the activation of the mucosal immune response that promotes the secretion of non-specific immune molecules into the skin mucus, resulting in the decrease of bacterial growth capacity in mucus. From our transcriptomic enrichment analysis, the regulation of genes related with the secretory pathway suggests that the tested phytogenics could be also stimulating the recruitment of phagocytic cells. The reduction in skin mucus cortisol is in line with the recognized properties of the phytogenics. Since the exact mechanisms promoted by the tested phytogenics were not yet demystified, further analysis should be made in order to assess the effect of the experimental diet on skin phagocytes and phagocytosis potential. More efforts are also needed for determining the impact of the functional additive on the skin defensive status against other pathogenic bacteria that threaten the success of aquaculture under intensive farming regime.</p>
