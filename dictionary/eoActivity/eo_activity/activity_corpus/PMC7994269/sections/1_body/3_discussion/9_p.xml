<p>Garlic, carvacrol, and/or thymol have been several times described to improve immune cells phagocytic capacity. For instance, dietary garlic (0.5 and 1% inclusion) enhanced the activity of head kidney macrophages phagocytic in rainbow trout (
 <italic>Oncorhynchus mykiss</italic>) (

 <italic>Oreochromis niloticus</italic> x 
 <italic>Oreochromis aureus</italic>) fed a 0.5% garlic-supplemented diet (

 <italic>Cyprinus carpio</italic>) was increased due to dietary oregano's essential oil, which is rich in carvacrol and thymol, in a dose-dependent manner (
