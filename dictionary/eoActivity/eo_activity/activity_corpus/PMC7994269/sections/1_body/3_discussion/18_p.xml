<p>During stress adaptation, cortisol has been suggested as a signal factor that induces tissue specific molecular programming in fish (
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>). Cortisol is able to induce a skin local stress response in fish (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>), which is particularly characterized by the increase of the secretory activity, related vesicles, apoptosis (
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>), and transcriptional alterations (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). Under this context, the observed changes in mucus cortisol secretion might be contributing to the obtained secretory-related transcriptional response as well. Furthermore, since a correlation between cortisol secretion and skin mucus oxidative stress was demonstrated (
 <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>), a reduction of the skin oxidative stress in response of an increase in antioxidative power induced by the tested phytogenics would be also expected. In fact, in our current study genes coding for antioxidative enzymes were observed to be up-regulated in the skin of fish fed the phytogenic-supplemented diet, as for example the Glutathione S-Transferase Kappa 1 (
 <italic>gstk1</italic>). GSTK1 belongs to the as Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) superfamily of oxidative stress enzymes, which are mainly known for their important role in cellular detoxification (
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>). GSTs have been used as markers for fish antioxidative capacity (
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>), including the evaluation of phytogenics in aquafeeds (
 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>). Under stress-imposed conditions or injury, the transcription of skin 
 <italic>gst</italic> is usually decreased and associated to immunosuppression in gilthead seabream (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). The Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2 Like 2 (
 <italic>nfe2l2</italic>), an important transcription factor that positively regulates the expression of cytoprotective genes (
 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>), and the N-Acetyltransferase 1 (
 <italic>nat1</italic>), known for its participation in the detoxification of drugs and other xenobiotics (
 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>), were also observed to be up-regulated by the functional diet. In addition, Heat Shock Protein family genes (
 <italic>dnajc8, dnajb9</italic>, and 
 <italic>hspa14</italic>) were down-regulated in the fish fed the phytogenic-supplemented diet. In particular, HSPA14 is member of the Hsp70 family, which proteins levels have been described to increase in fish under stress or pathological conditions (
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>). Therefore, the regulation of these genes is supporting the involvement of immune cells in the skin response observed, suggesting a reduction of the skin oxidative stress in response of the reduced mucus cortisol secretion and/or by the antioxidative characteristics of the tested phytogenics. In fact, the inclusion of garlic (
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>), carvacrol, and thymol (
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>) in aquafeeds have been continuously demonstrated to enhanced fish antioxidant status. In the present study, the epidermal mucus antioxidant capacity was also measured by mean of the FRAP analysis (
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>). Although our transcriptional analysis revealed the regulation of several markers of oxidative stress, according to FRAP's analyses the mucus antioxidant power was not significantly changed by the tested additive. Our results are in agreement with some previous studies which reported that the dietary supplementation of carvacrol and/or thymol-rich compounds did not affect the skin mucus biochemical contents or mucus antioxidant status (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>).
