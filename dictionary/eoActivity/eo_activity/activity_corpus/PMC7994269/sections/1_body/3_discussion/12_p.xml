<p>Other mediators of the inflammatory response were also observed to be regulated in the skin of fish fed the phytogenic-diet. For instance, the Negative Regulator of Reactive Oxygen Species (
 <italic>nrros</italic>) gene expression was increased. The NRROS protein regulates ROS production by phagocytes during inflammatory response, allowing phagocytes to produce high amounts of ROS in case of infection, while minimizing host's tissue damage (
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>). NRROS is also suggested to play a role in the maintenance of the immune homeostasis through the inhibition of TLR-mediated MAPK and NF-kB activation (
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>). Another negative mediator of the inflammatory response, the NLR Family CARD Domain Containing 3 (
 <italic>nlrc3</italic>) was also observed to be up-regulated in fish fed the phytogenic-supplemented diet. NLRC3 is known to negatively regulate NLR-mediated inflammatory responses (
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>). In several fish species, the overexpression of 
 <italic>nlrc3</italic> was observed to be systematically induced by bacterial and LPS challenges (
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>), including in mucosal tissues (
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>), demonstrating its important role in the fish innate immune response and homeostasis maintenance. The DEAD-Box Helicase 1 (
 <italic>ddx1</italic>), reported to enhance NF-kB mediated transcriptional activation (
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>) and recently associated to antiviral responses in fish (
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>), was also down-regulated in the skin of fish fed the phytogenic-supplemented diet. Therefore, according to the overall response observed considering the transcriptomic profiling of 
 <italic>il-1</italic>Î², 
 <italic>aimp1, tnfaip2, tnip2, nrros, nlrc3</italic>, and 
 <italic>ddx1</italic>, the regulation of these pro- and anti-inflammatory genes suggests an active cytokine secretion, an immune cell-cell signaling, and the tight control of such response.
