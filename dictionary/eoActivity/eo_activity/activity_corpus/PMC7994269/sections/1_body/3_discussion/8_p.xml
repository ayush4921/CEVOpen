<p>The functionality and modulation of genes related to the “endosome” and “lysosome” cellular components reinforce the hypothesis of an increased professional phagocytic activity in the skin of fish fed the phytogenic-supplemented diet. Among them, Rab-interacting proteins coding genes (
 <italic>rilp, rab11fip1</italic>) were up-regulated. These genes are involved in several processes like (i) endosomal recycling (
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>), (ii) endocytic transport to degradative compartments (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>) and (iii) in the control of membrane trafficking along the phagocytic pathway (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). In addition, the Microtubule Associated Protein 1 Light Chain 3 Gamma (
 <italic>map1lc3c</italic>) was up-regulated. This autophagy-related protein is involved in the LC3-associated phagocytosis, in which LC3 is recruited to the phagosome membrane during phagocytosis of pathogens, enhancing the fusion between phagosome and lysosomes (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). In fact, fish epidermal macrophages are characterized by well-developed endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi areas and several lysosome-like vesicles and phagosomes (
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>). Remarkably, the up-regulation of the MAF BZIP Transcription Factor B (
 <italic>mafb</italic>), a myeloid lineage-specific transcription factor, which expression levels increase during macrophage differentiation and maturation (
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>), was also observed in the skin of fish fed the phytogenic-supplemented diet. Therefore, the regulation of LC3 proteins-coding genes and the up-regulation of 
 <italic>mafb</italic> by the phytogenics might support the participation of phagocytic cells in the immune response from the skin observed in our study. The down-regulation of Microtubule Associated Protein 1 Light Chain 3 Beta (
 <italic>map1lc3b</italic>) opens the possibility to selective and differential mechanisms of activation aimed to the promotion of the phagocytic activity in response to phytogenic supplementation.
