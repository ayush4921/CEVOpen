<p>Regardless of its critical function protecting the host, the skin mucus also represents an important portal of entry for pathogens since it can provide a favorable microenvironment for some bacteria, the main disease agents for fish, which may induce the development of biofilms depending on the pathogen adhesion capacity (

 <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> infection” pathway was obtained from the analysis of the DEGs of fish fed the phytogenic-based additive. Although the analysis was performed using 
 <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> as model organism, the down-regulation of several genes of the “
 <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> infection” KEGG pathway could also be applied, from a comparative point of view, to an infection process involving a 
 <italic>Vibrio</italic> species in a mucosal tissue, such as 
 <italic>V. anguillarum</italic>, as a consequence of the protective effect of the additive. For instance, the down-regulation of several coding genes for V-type H+ ATPase subunits (
 <italic>atp6v1c1, atp6v1b1, atp6ap1</italic>) in fish fed the phytogenic-supplemented diet was obtained. The V-type H+ ATPase complex in endosomes and lysosomes is responsible for the vesicle import of protons and maintenance of the internal acidic pH, crucial for degradative enzymes activity (
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>). Apart from the “proton-transporting two-sector ATPase complex” cellular component obtained from our enrichment analysis, the down-regulation of the above-mentioned genes also figured in the KEGG “Phagosome” pathway, which could be suggesting a decreased phagosomal activity at the sampling time evaluated (65 days of diet administration). Such gene modulation could be associated to a decrease in skin bacterial pathogens in our fish fed with phytogenic-supplemented diet. This hypothesis is in agreement with the results obtained from the bacterial growth assessment in the epidermal mucus
