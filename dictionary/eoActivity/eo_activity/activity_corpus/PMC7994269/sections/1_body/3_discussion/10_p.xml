<p>Phagocytic events are driven by rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton (

 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>), was up-regulated in the skin by the phytogenics. Similarly, the Actin Beta (
 <italic>actb</italic>) gene was also up-regulated. Actin is commonly found in the mucus of several fish species, including gilthead seabream (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), which has led to speculations on its immune function in fish defense. In fact, ACTB levels were observed to be significantly increased in sea lice challenged Atlantic salmon (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). In gilthead seabream, 
 <italic>actb</italic> expression in skin mucus was favored by a dietary probiotic administration (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Furthermore, the extracellular cytoplasmic actin in insects was observed to bind to bacteria surface, mediating its phagocytosis and killing (
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>), suggesting that actin could be functionally active in fish skin mucus as well. However, this hypothesis needs further investigation. In summary, our transcriptional analysis could be indicating an enhanced phagocyte function in the skin of fish fed the phytogenic-diet, which would suggest the promotion of the host's defense ability in resisting bacterial infections.
