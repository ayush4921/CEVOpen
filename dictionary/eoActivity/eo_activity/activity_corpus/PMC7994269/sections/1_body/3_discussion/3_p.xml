<p>Iron is an essential micronutrient required for most bacteria to grow; in the host, this metal is associated to iron-binding proteins, such as transferrin found in fish skin and mucus (

 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), limiting its availability to invading pathogenic bacteria (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). For instance, 
 <italic>V. anguillarum</italic> iron-uptake system is crucial for sequestering iron from these proteins and accomplishing skin colonization and penetration (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Interestingly, some genes related with iron metabolism were observed to be down-regulated in the skin of fish fed the functional diet. In our transcriptional analysis, the Iron-Responsive Element-Binding Protein 2 (
 <italic>ireb2</italic>) gene was down-regulated in fish fed the phytogenic-supplemented diet. When cell's iron levels are low or depleted, this RNA-binding protein binds to iron-responsive elements, found for instance in transferrin mRNAs, regulating the translation and stability of those mRNAs and consequently regulating iron availability (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). In zebrafish, the increase of 
 <italic>ireb2</italic> expression in spleen was proposed to be linked to an augmented iron uptake from 
 <italic>V. anguillarum</italic> (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Hence, the down-regulation of 
 <italic>ireb2</italic> observed in the skin of fish fed the phytogenic-diet could be suggesting a decrease in the cellular iron uptake as a consequence of the reduction of pathogenic bacteria load in the mucosal tissue. This hypothesis is supported by the decreased growth capacity for pathogenic bacteria in skin mucus observed in the fish fed the tested functional diet.
