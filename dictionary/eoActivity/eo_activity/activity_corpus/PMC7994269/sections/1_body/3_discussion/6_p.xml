<p>Our study also revealed that Cathepsin A (
 <italic>ctsa</italic>) was up-regulated in the skin of fish fed the phytogenic-supplemented diet. An increase in turbot (
 <italic>Scophthalmus maximus</italic>) 
 <italic>ctsa</italic> expression in skin was described in response to infection challenges, while 
 <italic>ctsa</italic> genes microbial binding capacity was also observed, in which a high affinity to LPS, and a lower affinity to lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and peptidoglycan (PGN), was suggested to be implicated in the sensing and phagocytosis of bacterial pathogens (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). By contrast, in our study the expression of Cathepsin L (
 <italic>ctsl</italic>) was down-regulated. Different cathepsins have been detected in the mucus of several fish species, which were observed to exhibit high bacteriolytic activity against several fish pathogens (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>), evidencing their key role in fish mucosal innate immunity. Fish skin 
 <italic>ctsl</italic> transcripts were observed to be significantly up-regulated after challenges with several bacterial pathogens, including 
 <italic>V. anguillarum</italic> (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). Moreover, as for 
 <italic>ctsa</italic> genes, it was demonstrated that 
 <italic>ctsl</italic> genes have strong 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> binding capacity to microbial ligands, suggesting an important role of 
 <italic>ctsl</italic> in fish mucosal immunity (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). The different gene expression pattern observed for 
 <italic>ctsa</italic> and 
 <italic>ctsl</italic> could be related to a time-dependent response, as suggested previously for genes involved in the immune response in fish subjected to feeding trials (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). The differential expression between both cathepsins could be also attributed to the mucosal tissue response specificity. In this way, it has been reported that the same stimulus may differentially modulate the expression for the same genes depending of the mucosal tissue evaluated (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). However, if both genes are linked with the decrease in the bacterial growth observed at skin mucus deserves further investigations.
