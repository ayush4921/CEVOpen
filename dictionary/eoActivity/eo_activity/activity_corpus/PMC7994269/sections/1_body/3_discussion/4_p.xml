<p>On the other hand, iron plays an important role in hemoglobin production. The Hemoglobin Subunit Alpha (
 <italic>hba1</italic>) was up-regulated in the skin of fish fed the phytogenic-supplemented diet. Hemoglobin functionality is not restricted to oxygen transport, since it also binds to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), triggering an immune Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated signal transduction (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). In addition, the STEAP4 Metalloreductase (
 <italic>steap4</italic>) transcripts increased by the phytogenic-diet. This metalloreductase is involved in iron and copper homeostasis, playing also a role in the protection against inflammatory-mediated cellular damage (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). In Atlantic salmon (
 <italic>Salmo salar</italic>) skin, 
 <italic>steap4</italic> was up-regulated by dietary phytogenics, which was associated to iron sequestration, inflammation and an increased protective capacity against lice infection (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). The 
 <italic>hba1</italic> and 
 <italic>steap4</italic> up-regulation in the skin observed in our study may be implicated in a reduction in iron availability in the skin surface and mucus of fish fed the phytogenics, hampering pathogenic bacteria growth as observed in the potential mucus antibacterial capacity observed in our study.
