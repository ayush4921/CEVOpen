<p>The fish skin mucosal surface is in direct contact with the aquatic environment and represents the first line of defense against external threats, determining pathogen adhesion to the epithelial surface (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). As a mucosal tissue, the skin is characterized by its ability to produce mucus, which apart from being an intrinsic physical barrier, it contains glycosaminoglycans, lectins, antibacterial enzymes, immunoglobulins, and several structural, metabolic, stress-related, and signal transduction proteins [(
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>); among others]. In addition to mucus continuous secretion and replacement (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), its components provide an impermeable capacity against most bacteria and other pathogens, immobilizing them and inhibiting their proliferation before they can contact epithelial surfaces (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Importantly, an intimate crosstalk between skin tissue and its exuded mucus in response to stimulus has been recently proposed (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), reinforcing the coordinated response capacity that takes place in this mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue.
