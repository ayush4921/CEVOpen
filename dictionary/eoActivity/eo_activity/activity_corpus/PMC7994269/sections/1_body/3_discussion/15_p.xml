<p>Our results suggest that the phytogenic-supplemented diet may reduce the settlement of the studied bacteria in the skin surface, decreasing the risk of infection. Previous nutritional studies in which diets containing garlic, carvacrol, or thymol provided effective mucus antibacterial characteristics against fish pathogens. For instance, dietary garlic supplementation (5 and 10 g kg-1) was demonstrated to significantly increase skin mucus antimicrobial activity against several bacterial pathogens in the freshwater Caspian roach (
 <italic>Rutilus rutilus</italic>) (
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>). A similar increased bactericidal activity against 
 <italic>Photodamselae</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>piscicida</italic> was observed in the skin mucus of gilthead seabream juveniles fed diets supplemented with oregano powder (0.5 and 1% inclusion) for 15 and 30 days (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>). In addition, an enhanced skin mucus bactericidal activity against 
 <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> and 
 <italic>Aeromonas hydrophila</italic> was observed in Pacific red snapper (
 <italic>Lutjanus peru</italic>) fed a diet supplemented with a medicinal plant extract rich in carvacrol and thymol (0.5, 1, and 2% inclusion) (
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>). On the contrary, other studies incorporating 
 <italic>Oliveria decumbens</italic>, which is rich in carvacrol (18.8 and 52.9% included in an essential oil and aromatic water fractions, respectively) and thymol (20.3 and 37.6% included in an essential oil and an aromatic water fractions, respectively), in Nile tilapia (
 <italic>O. niloticus</italic>) diets reported the absence of changes in mucus bactericidal activity against 
 <italic>Streptococcus iniae</italic>. By contrast, the compounds showed high antibacterial capacity when evaluated 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>). Similarly, Beltr√°n et al. (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>) did not find an enhancement of antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>V. anguillarum</italic> in the mucus of gilthead seabream fed a diet supplemented with 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> at 0.5 and 1.0%, although a significant increased bactericidal activity against 
 <italic>Photobacterium damselae</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>piscicida</italic> was observed. The above-mentioned contradictory results could be a consequence of different factors, such as different phytogenics and their content in bioactive compounds, supplementation period of the functional diet, dietary compounds delivery and bioavailability, or an evidence of the synergy between the phytogenics tested that might improve such bactericidal capacity.
