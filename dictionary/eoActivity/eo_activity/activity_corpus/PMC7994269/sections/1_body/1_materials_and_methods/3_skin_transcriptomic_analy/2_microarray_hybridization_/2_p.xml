<p>The Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) public repository version 11.0 (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://string-db.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://string-db.org</ext-link>) was used to generate the skin transcripteractome for the fish fed the phytogenic-supplemented diet. A Protein-Protein interaction (PPI) Networks Functional Enrichment Analysis for all the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was conducted with a high-confidence interaction score (0.9) using 
 <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> as model organism (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis of all the DEGs obtained were also assessed through STRING (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). In order to confirm match of gene acronyms between both 
 <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> and gilthead seabream species, human orthology identification based on gene/protein name was accessed through the Genecards (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genecards.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.genecards.org</ext-link>) (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) and Uniprot (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uniprot.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.uniprot.org</ext-link>) databases. Additionally, protein-protein BLAST (BLASTp) were run (
