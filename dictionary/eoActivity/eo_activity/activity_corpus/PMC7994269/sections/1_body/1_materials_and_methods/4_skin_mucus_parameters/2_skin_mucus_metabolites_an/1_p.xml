<p>Glucose concentration on fish skin mucus was determined by an enzymatic colorimetric test (LO-POD glucose, SPINREACT®, St. Esteve de Bas, Spain) as described in (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The OD of the reaction was determined at λ = 505 nm with a microplate reader and glucose values expressed as μg glucose per mL of skin mucus. Lactate concentration was determined by an enzymatic colorimetric test (LO-POD lactate, SPINREACT®) following the manufacturer's instructions but with slight modifications for fish skin mucus (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The OD was determined at λ = 505 nm and lactate values expressed as μg lactate per mL of skin mucus. Protein concentration of previously homogenized mucus samples was determined using the Bradford assay (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) using bovine serum albumin (Sigma Aldrich, Madrid, Spain) as standard. In particular, mucus samples or standard solutions (from 0 to 1.41 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) were mixed with 250 μL of Bradford reagent and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. The OD was determined at λ = 596 nm in a microplate reader. Protein values were expressed as mg protein per mL of skin mucus. Cortisol levels were measured using an ELISA kit (IBL International, Tecan Group, Switzerland) following the manufacturer's instructions for saliva determinations. Values of OD were determined at λ = 450 nm with a microplate reader. Cortisol values were expressed as ng cortisol per mL of skin mucus. All standards and samples were analyzed in triplicate (methodological replicates) and spectrophotometric measurements were conducted with an Infinity Pro200
 <sup>TM</sup> spectrophotometer (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland).
