<p>Ferric Antioxidant Power (FRAP) was measured by means of an enzymatic colorimetric test (Ferric antioxidant status detection kit, Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Spain), following the manufacturer's instructions for plasma, with minor modifications. Briefly, 20 μL of mucus sample or standard solutions (from 0 to 1,000 μM μL
 <sup>−1</sup> of FeCl
 <sub>2</sub>) were mixed with 75 μL of FRAP color solution and incubated at room temperature for 30 min, in triplicate. The OD was measured at λ = 560 nm. Antioxidant values were expressed as nmol FRAP per mL of mucus, and nmol FRAP per mg of mucus protein. All measurements were performed with a microplate spectrophotometer reader (Infinity Pro200
 <sup>TM</sup> spectrophotometer).
