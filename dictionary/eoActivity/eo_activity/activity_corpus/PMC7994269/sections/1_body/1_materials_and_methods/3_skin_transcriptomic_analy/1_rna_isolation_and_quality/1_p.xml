<p>Total RNA from the skin of twelve randomly selected fish per dietary treatment was extracted using the RNeasy® Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany). Total RNA was eluted in a final volume of 35 μL nuclease-free water and treated with DNAse (DNA-free
 <sup>TM</sup> DNA Removal Kit; Invitrogen, Lithuania). Total RNA concentration and purity were measured using Nanodrop-2000® spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA) and stored at −80°C until analysis. Prior to hybridization with microarrays, RNA samples were diluted to 133.33 ng/μL concentration, checked for RNA integrity (Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer; Agilent Technologies, Spain) and selected by the criteria of a RIN value &gt;8.5. Three different pools of samples per dietary treatment were established (
