<p>Skin transcriptional analysis from both experimental groups was carried out using the Aquagenomics 
 <italic>Sparus aurata</italic> oligonucleotide microarray v2.0 (4 × 44 K) (SAQ) platform. Detailed information and transcriptomic raw data are available at the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) public repository at the US National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), accession numbers GPL13442, and GSE162504, respectively. The sampling labeling, hybridization, washes, and scanning was performed as described in (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Briefly, a one-color RNA labeling was used (Agilent One-Color RNA Spike-In kit; Agilent Technologies, USA). RNA from each sample pool (200 ng) was reverse-transcribed with spike-in. Then, total RNA was used as template for Cyanine-3 (Cy3) labeled cRNA synthesis and amplified with the Quick Amp Labeling kit (Agilent Technologies). cRNA samples were purified using the RNeasy® micro kit (Qiagen). Dye incorporation and cRNA yield were checked (NanoDrop ND-2000® spectrophotometer). Then, Cy3-labeled cRNA (1.5 mg) with specific activity &gt;6.0 pmol Cy3/mg cRNA was fragmented at 60°C for 30 min, and hybridized with the array in presence of hybridization buffer (Gene expression hybridization kit, Agilent Technologies) at 65°C for 17 h. For washes, microarrays were incubated with Gene expression wash buffers, and stabilization and drying solution according to manufacturer instructions (Agilent Technologies). Microarray slides were then scanned (Agilent G2505B Microarray Scanner System), and spot intensities and other quality control features extracted (Agilent Feature Extraction software version 10.4.0.0).
