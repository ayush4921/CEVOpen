<p>Differences between growth performance parameters were analyzed through an unpaired 
 <italic>t</italic>-test (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) with GraphPad PRISM 7.00 assuming data homoscedasticity. Differences between skin mucus metabolites and cortisol, and differences in bacterial growth inhibition between the two dietary treatments were assessed with SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 22.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA) through an unpaired 
 <italic>t</italic>-test (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Microarrays extracted raw data were imported and analyzed with GeneSpring version 14.5 GX software (Agilent Technologies). The 75% percentile normalization was used to standardize arrays for comparisons and data were filtered by expression. An unpaired 
 <italic>t</italic>-test was conducted without correction to identify those DEGs between both dietary treatments. A 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The representation for the principal component analysis (PCA) and the hierarchical heatmap were generated using GeneSpring version 14.5 GX software.
