<p>Fish were fed two experimental diets, one devoid of the functional feed additive (control diet) and a second one supplemented with 0.5% of a microencapsulated functional additive containing synthetic garlic essential oil, carvacrol, and thymol (AROTEC-G®, TECNOVIT-FARMFAES, S.L., Spain). Both diets were tested in triplicate tanks and administered for a period of 65 days. Fish were hand-fed two times per day at the daily rate of 3.0% of the stocked biomass, which approached apparent satiation. The control diet was formulated with high levels of marine-derived protein sources (30% fishmeal, 2.5% soluble protein concentrate—CPSP 90® and 2.5 krill meal), containing 46% crude protein, 18% crude fat, and 21.5 MJ/kg gross energy (

In particular, main ingredients were ground (below 250 μm) in a micropulverizer hammer mill (SH1; Hosokawa Micron, B.V., Doetinchem, The Netherlands). Powder ingredients and oils were then mixed according to the target formulation in a paddle mixer (RM90; Mainca, S.L., Granollers, Spain). All diets were manufactured by temperature-controlled extrusion (pellet sizes: 2.0 mm) by means of a low-shear extruder (P55; Italplast, S.r.l., Parma, Italy). Upon extrusion, all feed batches were dried in a convection oven (OP 750-UF; LTE Scientifics, Oldham, UK) for 4 h at 45°C.
