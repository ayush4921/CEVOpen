<p>Juveniles of gilthead seabream were purchased from a Mediterranean fish farm (Piscicultura Marina Mediterránea S.L., Andromeda Group, Valencia, Spain) and on-grown at IRTA–Sant Carles de la Ràpita facilities for research purposes (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Before the onset of the trial, fish were individually measured in body weight (BW) and standard length (SL) to the nearest 0.1 g and 1 mm, respectively (BW = 40.3 ± 0.1 g; SL = 12.0 ± 0.2 mm). Then, 150 juveniles were randomly distributed among six 450 L tanks (25 fish per tank; initial density = 2 kg m
 <sup>−3</sup>; three replicate tanks per experimental group) connected to an IRTAmar® system working under an open-flow regime.
