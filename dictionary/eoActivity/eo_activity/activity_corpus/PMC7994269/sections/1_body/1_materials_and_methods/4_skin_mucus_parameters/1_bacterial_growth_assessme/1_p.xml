<p>Two bacterial fish pathogens were used for the growth curve assay, 
 <italic>Vibrio anguillarum</italic> (CECT number: 522T), and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas anguilliseptica</italic> (CECT number: 899T) from the Spanish Type Culture Collection (CECT, University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain), and the non-pathogenic bacterium for fish, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (DSMZ number: 423) from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (Leibniz Institute DSMZ, Germany). The two pathogenic bacteria were cultured at 30°C for 24 h in marine broth (MB-2216, Becton and Dickinson, USA) and the 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> was cultured at 37°C for 24 h in trypticasein soy broth (TSB, Laboratorios Conda, Spain). For the culture in skin mucus, bacterial suspension with optical density (OD) of 0.2 were centrifuged and the pellet resuspended in sterile PBS, diluted in new growth medium and adjusted to 106 colony-forming units (CFU) mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. Then, to study the bacterial growth capacity in the skin mucus, aliquots of 100 μL of the previously cultured bacteria were incubated in 100 μL of skin mucus (3 pools of 6 individual fish per dietary treatment). In parallel, 100 μL of the same cultured bacteria were also incubated in 100 μL of its respective culture media, as a positive control. Triplicates of 100 μL of each fish mucus samples added to 100 μL of culture media were used as negative control and values subtracted from the bacteria–mucus aliquot results. The bacterial growth was measured by absorbance at λ = 400 nm every 30 min for 14 h at 25°C in flat-bottomed 96-well plates using an Infinity Pro200
 <sup>TM</sup> spectrophotometer. Similar temperature values for bacterial growth cultures (25°C) and fish rearing (25.1°C) were chosen in order to standardize mucus analyses with regard to fish rearing conditions used in the nutritional trial.
