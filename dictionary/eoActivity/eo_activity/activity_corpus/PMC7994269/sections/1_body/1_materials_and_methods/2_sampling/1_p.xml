<p>At the end of the trial, all fish were anesthetized (buffered 150 mg/L MS-222, Sigma-Aldrich, Madrid, Spain) and measured for individual body weight and standard length (BW
 <sub>control diet</sub> = 157.8 ± 14.2 g and SL
 <sub>control diet</sub> = 17.3 ± 0.6 cm; BW
 <sub>supplemented diet</sub> = 150.8 ± 14.9 g and SL
 <sub>supplemented diet</sub> = 17.1 ± 0.6 cm) as published in (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Then, eight fish from each tank (
 <italic>n</italic> = 24 per dietary treatment) were randomly selected and skin mucus sample collected following the method described in (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). In brief, skin mucus was collected from the over-lateral line of anesthetized fish in a front to caudal direction using sterile glass slides, and mucus was carefully pushed and collected in a sterile tube (2 mL), avoiding the contamination with blood and/or urine-genital and intestinal excretions. The above-mentioned procedure lasted &lt;2 min in order to avoid the degradation of mucus metabolites. Mucus samples were homogenized using a sterile Teflon pestle to desegregate mucus mesh before centrifugation at 14,000 × g during 15 min at 4°C. The resultant mucus supernatants were collected, avoiding the surface lipid layer, aliquoted, and stored at −80°C for further analysis. For transcriptional analysis purposes, other four fish were randomly selected from each tank (
 <italic>n</italic> = 12 fish per dietary treatment) and euthanized with an anesthetic overdose. A ca. 1 cm
 <sup>2</sup> section of the skin from the mid region of the body over the lateral line of the right side from each fish was dissected, and the muscle tissue attached to it removed. Samples were immersed in RNAlater™ (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Lithuania), incubated overnight (4°C) and stored at −80°C for further RNA extraction.
