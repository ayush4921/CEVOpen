<p>The skin mucus stress-related biomarkers and their ratios, as well as the ferric antioxidant power are summarized in

 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). However, glucose, lactate and cortisol levels were observed to be significantly lower in the mucus of gilthead seabream fed the phytogenic-supplemented diet (
 <italic>t</italic>-test, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). No differences among dietary groups were observed in terms of the ferric skin mucus antioxidant power (

 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). When data on skin mucus biomarkers were normalized with the protein content of the sample, only cortisol levels (cortisol/protein) were observed to be significantly reduced in skin mucus from fish fed the phytogenic-supplemented diet when compared to the control diet (
 <italic>t</italic>-test, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Metabolic aerobic response, measured in mucus as glucose/lactate ratio, was neither significantly affected by the dietary treatment.
