<p>The transcriptome response arose the modulation of genes associated to immune processes involved in the response to infectious bacterial diseases. Thus, we evaluated whether such response implies a functional protective mechanism against pathogenic bacterial growth on skin mucus. Considering that our data registered a specific response to 
 <italic>Vibrio</italic>, we included in our analysis the fish pathogen 
 <italic>V. anguillarum</italic>. In addition, we also included as control 
 <italic>P. anguilliseptica</italic> (another pathogenic marine fish bacteria) and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> as non-pathogenic fish bacterium.
