<p>Under present experimental conditions, in order to determine the modulatory effect of the dietary supplementation of a blend of garlic essential oil, carvacrol, and thymol upon the skin transcriptome, a microarray-based transcriptomic analysis was conducted in gilthead seabream. In total, 534 differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) were found in the skin from both experimental groups (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Among these, 393 genes were up-regulated with 390 belonging to the 1.0–1.5-fold change (FC) interval. The other 3 DEGs were grouped in the 1.5 ≤ FC ≤ 2.0 interval. On the other hand, 141 genes were down-regulated (
