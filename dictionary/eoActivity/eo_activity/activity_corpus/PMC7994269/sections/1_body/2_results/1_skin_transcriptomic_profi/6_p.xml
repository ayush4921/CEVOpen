<p>Additionally, from the total DEGs obtained from the skin transcriptomic profile of fish fed the phytogenic-supplemented diet, a set of genes were selected by their involvement in the “immune system process” (GO:0002376; 12 up-regulated genes; 5 down-regulated genes). Among the processes related to immunity, “antigen processing and presentation of exogenous peptide antigen via MHC class I” (GO:0002479; 1 up-regulated genes; 2 down-regulated genes), “leukocyte activation” (GO:0045321; 6 up-regulated genes; 1 down-regulated genes), “regulation of NIK/NF-kappaB signaling” (GO:1901222; 2 up-regulated genes; 1 down-regulated genes), “positive regulation of T cell cytokine production” (GO:0002726; 2 up-regulated genes; 0 down-regulated genes), and “regulation of T cell proliferation” (GO:0042129; 2 up-regulated genes; 1 down-regulated genes) biological processes were highlighted (
