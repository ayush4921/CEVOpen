<p>When cultured with the skin mucus from fish fed the phytogenic-supplemented diet, a reduction on the growth of the pathogenic bacteria 
 <italic>V. anguillarum</italic> was observed (

 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6A,B</xref>). Growth decrease was recorded between 4 and 14 h of bacterial culture; the most accentuated decrease in growth values compared with control diet (over 30%) were found between 8 and 12 h (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6A,B</xref>). Regarding 
 <italic>P. anguilliseptica</italic>, a decline in bacterial growth was observed in both gilthead seabream skin mucus samples from fish fed the control and phytogenic-supplemented diets (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6C,D</xref>). However, 
 <italic>P. anguilliseptica</italic> growth decline was observed to be more accentuated in the mucus from fish fed the phytogenic-supplemented diet than in that of the control group at 12–14 h of culture (
 <italic>t</italic>-test; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05), with a maximum decrease in growth of 50.2 ± 1.6% at 14 h (
