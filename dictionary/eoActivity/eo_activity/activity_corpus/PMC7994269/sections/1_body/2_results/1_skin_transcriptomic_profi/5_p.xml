<p>In order to identify the pathways significantly impacted by the total DEGs obtained, the functional analysis of KEGG pathways revealed also significant differences in the regulation of genes associated with “protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum” (hsa04141; 3 up-regulated genes; 5 down-regulated genes), “phagosome” pathway (hsa04145; 3 up-regulated genes; 5 down-regulated genes), and “
 <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> infection” pathway (hsa05110, belonging to the “infectious disease: bacterial” group; 1 up-regulated gene; 4 down-regulated genes) in the skin of the group fed with the blend of tested phytogenics (
