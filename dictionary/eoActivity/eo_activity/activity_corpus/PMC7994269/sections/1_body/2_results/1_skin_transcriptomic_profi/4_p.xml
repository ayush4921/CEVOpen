<p>In order to elucidate the location relative to the cellular structures in which the DEGs perform their function, several cellular components were identified in the functional network, representing the association between them (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The analysis included the, “ribonucleoprotein complex” (GO:1990904; 10 up-regulated genes; 9 down-regulated genes), “vesicle” (GO:0031982; 20 up-regulated genes; 20 down-regulated genes), “transport vesicle membrane” (GO:0030658; 2 up-regulated genes; 5 down-regulated genes), “COPII-coated ER to Golgi transport vesicle” (GO:0030134; 2 up-regulated genes; 3 down-regulated genes), “Golgi-associated vesicle” (GO:000579810; 3 up-regulated genes; 4 down-regulated genes), “endosome” (GO:0005768; 10 up-regulated genes; 9 down-regulated genes), “vacuole” (GO:0005773; 9 up-regulated genes; 12 down-regulated genes), “lysosome” (GO:0005764; 7 up-regulated genes; 7 down-regulated genes), and “proton-transporting two-sector ATPase complex” (GO:0016469; 1 up-regulated genes; 3 down-regulated genes).
