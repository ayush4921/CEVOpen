<p>When considering the complete list of annotated DEGs, a functional network (transcripteractome) containing 203 nodes was generated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), which resulted in 341 interactions (edges). The remaining 331 DEGs, annotated as unknown genes, were excluded from the analysis. The enrichment analysis identified in the transcripteractome two main representative processes that were considered to encompass the several Gene Ontology (GO) annotations obtained (
