<p>The correlation coefficients between the antioxidant, enzyme inhibitory activities, and the TPC, flavonoid content, and TAC for all extracts were analyzed (
 <xref rid="T6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). According to the results, a strong correlation was found between phenolic compounds and the antioxidant activities assessed by various methods, evidencing that phenolic compounds are the major constituents that contribute to the antioxidant activity. The antioxidant capacity determined by the DPPH assay (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) showed a strong negative correlation with TPC (r = -0.841, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and TFC (r = -0.907, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), confirming that the lower the amount of IC
 <sub>50</sub>, the higher would be the content of TFC and TPC.
