 <sup>]</sup>. Quercetin was employed as a standard. The diluted extracts or quercetin (0.5 ml) were mixed with 2.8 ml of distilled water, followed by the addition of 100 µl of 10% (w/v) aluminum chloride and 100 µl of potassium acetate (1.0 M) solution. After 40 min of incubation, the absorbance was read at 415 nm. The standard curve of quercetin was utilized to determine the TFC expressed as mg quercetin equivalent/gDW.
