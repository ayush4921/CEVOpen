 <sup>]</sup>. For this purpose, 1 ml of various concentrations (0.1-1 mg/ml) of each extract was mixed with 1 ml of phosphate buffer (0.2 M, pH 6.6) and 1 ml of potassium ferricyanide (1%), followed by incubating at 50 °C for 20 min. Then 1 ml of trichloroacetic acid (10%) was added to the mixture and centrifuged (3000 ×g, 10 min, 4 °C). After mixing 1.5 ml of supernatant with distilled water (1.5 ml) and FeCl
 <sub>3</sub> (0.15 ml, 0.1%), the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 min, and the absorbance was read at 700 nm. The higher the absorbance of the reaction mixture, the higher the RP of the extracts. The extract concentration providing EC
 <sub>50</sub> was calculated from the graph of absorbance at 700 nm against the extract concentration. Trolox under the same conditions was used as the positive control.
