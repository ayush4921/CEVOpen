 <sup>]</sup>. In brief, 1 ml of various concentrations (0.25-4 mg/ml) of each extract was mixed with 1 ml of 0.1 mM DPPH solution in methanol. The mixture was allowed to stand (0.5 h/in the dark), and the absorbance was measured at 517 nm against the blank (methanol). Then 0.1 mM of DPPH solution was used separately as the control. The inhibition percentage for scavenging DPPH radical by the extracts was calculated according to Eq. (2).
