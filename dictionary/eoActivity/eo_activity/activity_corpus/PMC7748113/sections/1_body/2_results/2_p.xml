<p>As the first step of our experimental process, amounts of total bioactive compounds were evaluated in various extracts of 
 <italic>A. repens</italic> (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The results showed that the TPC in various extracts presented significant differences according to the solvent used. The highest content of TPC was obtained by 70% acetone, followed by the 70% methanol. The extract prepared with 70% ethanol presented the lowest content. The effect of the solvents on TFC of extracts followed a similar trend to total phenol, as the 70% acetonic extract has the highest level of flavonoid content, followed by the 70% methanol and 70% ethanol extracts. The most efficient solvent for extracting anthocyanins was the acidified methanol.
