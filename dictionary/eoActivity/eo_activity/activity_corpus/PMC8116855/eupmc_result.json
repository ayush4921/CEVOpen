    "In this study, chicory essential oil (CEO) was obtained by hydrodistillation-based extraction method and it was rich in camphor (31.3%) and phenolic compounds with outstanding antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. The CEO was then incorporated into <i>Lepidium perfoliatum</i> seed mucilage (LPSM) based aqueous solution to prepare an active CEO-loaded LPSM edible coating. The effect of the edible coating was then investigated on the quality and shelf life of beef slices during 7 days storage at 4°C. The results revealed that beef slice coated with CEO-loaded LPSM edible coating had a significant inhibitory effect on its lipid oxidation and microbial growth. The CEO-LPSM coating also inhibited the weight and texture losses of beef slices during display more efficiently compared with the control and CEO-free LPSM coating. Besides, the beef slices coated with CEO-LPSM were the preferred samples in terms of sensory scores throughout the storage. Thus, using CEO-rich LPSM edible coating might inhibit decay and significantly improve the shelf life of fresh beef."
