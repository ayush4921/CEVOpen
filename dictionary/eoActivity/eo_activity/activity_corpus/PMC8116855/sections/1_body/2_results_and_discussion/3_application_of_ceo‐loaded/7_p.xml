<p>It is also necessary to point out that lipid oxidation is considered as one of the main factors of quality deterioration in beef. The PV and TBA value were then measured as lipid oxidation indices (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32186-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). As can be observed in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32186-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>, the PV increased significantly during refrigeration storage. The uncoated beef sample experienced the highest PV increase during storage (6.69‐fold). While the PV of the coated samples increased remarkably slowly, and the LPSM + 0%CEO, LPSM + 0.5%CEO, LPSM + 1%CEO, and LPSM + 1.5%CEO showed approximately 5.85‐, 5.95‐, 5.71‐, and 4.31‐fold PV increase as the storage time rose from 1 to 7 days. It is noteworthy that the permitted PV limit for meat is 7 meq O
 <sub>2</sub>/kg (Alizadeh Behbahani, Noshad, et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32186-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Accordingly, the uncoated beef sample exceeded the permitted limit on the 7th day and its shelf life is therefore predicted to be 5 days under cold storage conditions; while, the beef samples coated by LPSM + 1%CEO and LPSM + 1.5%CEO had lower PVs than the limited value, and the shelf life of these coated meat samples is greater than 7 days.
