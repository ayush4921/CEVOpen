<p>Similar trends were observed for the PTC,

 <xref rid="fsn32186-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2b–e</xref>). Despite the fact that all the beef slices experienced a significant increase (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) in the microbial growth over time, the coated samples had significantly lower microbial counts compared with the noncoated one. And this effect was more pronounced in the samples wrapped by LPSM + 1.5%CEO. The positive effect of the CEO‐loaded LPSM edible coating on the beef preservation could be mainly ascribed to (a) the antimicrobial activity of the oil and (b) the oxygen barrier characteristics of the edible coating. The growth of aerobic microorganism, such as fungi and psychrotrophic bacteria, which are the main cause of meat spoilage during cold storage under aerobic conditions, is therefore inhibited remarkably (Alizadeh Behbahani &amp; Imani Fooladi,

 <xref rid="fsn32186-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2018b</xref>). These results are in accordance with those of Kiarsi et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn32186-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>), who reported that EOs‐loaded seed mucilage‐based edible coatings could significantly suppress the growth of microorganisms (i.e., TVC, PTC, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and fungi) during cold storage.
