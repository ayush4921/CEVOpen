<p>Oxidation and microbial growth in foods are also associated with consumer rejection. As shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32186-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, all sensory properties of beef samples (odor, color, texture, and overall acceptance), whether coated or not, decreased progressively as a function of storage time; however, the beef slices with CEO were the preferred beef and all treatments with edible coating received higher scores in comparison with the control. From the panelist points of view, the meat samples could be only accepted when the sensory properties received high scores, greater than 4 (Heydari et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32186-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). In this context, the control sample was unacceptable in terms of all sensory features after 7 days storage, whereas the CEO‐loaded LPSM coated beef slices were acceptable throughout the display. Indeed, the beef slices coated by CEO‐rich LPSM, which had the highest oxidative and microbial stability, ranked the highest sensory scores, as well. This is mainly due to the antimicrobial and antioxidant activity of the oil and oxygen/water barrier properties of the edible coating, inhibiting oxidation and microbial growth and subsequent quality loss of meat (Alizadeh Behbahani, Noshad, et al.,
