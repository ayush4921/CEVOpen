<p>Accordingly, the beef slices coated by the CEO‐rich LPSM had the lowest changes in pH value (Figure

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). The samples coated by CEO‐loaded LPSM had significantly higher hardness value compared with the control sample, at the 7th day of storage. This could probably due to microbial growth‐suppression and meat enzymes activity‐inhibitory effects of the CEO and edible coating, thereby preventing meat protein degradation and subsequent pH increase and texture loss (Mohan et al.,
