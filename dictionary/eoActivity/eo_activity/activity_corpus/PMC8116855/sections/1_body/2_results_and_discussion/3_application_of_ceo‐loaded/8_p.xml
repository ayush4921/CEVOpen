<p>Before storage (day 1), the TBA levels were similar in the beef slices from uncoated and CEO‐loaded LPSM coated treatments and lowest from treatments containing higher CEO concentrations (

However, the addition of CEO into LPSM edible coating decreased the TBA progression more efficiently, and all the CEO‐loaded LPSM coated beef slices had lower TBA levels than the acceptable limit. This study showed that the use of CEO‐rich edible coating was effective in delaying the oxidation of beef during 7 days of refrigeration display, probably due to the antioxidant activity of the oil and the ability of the edible coating to minimize the contact with oxygen and light (Alizadeh Behbahani &amp; Imani Fooladi,
