 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and fungi counts of the control and coated beef slices during cold storage. The samples experienced a significant increase in TVC as a function of storage period (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32186-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), and the coated samples had significantly lower TVC than the noncoated one. Indeed, the TVC of the beef slices increased up to 5.24‐, 4.23‐, 4.16‐, 3.22‐, and 3.15‐fold in control, LPSM + 0%CEO, LPSM + 0.5%CEO, LPSM + 1%CEO, and LPSM + 1.5%CEO coated samples, respectively, by the end of storage time. It is also worth to note that a TVC of 7 log CFU/g is the maximum permitted TVC level for fresh beef (Alizadeh Behbahani, Noshad, et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32186-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). In this context, the beef slices exceeded the permitted level on day 3 (control) and day 5 (LPSM + 0%CEO and LPSM + 0.5%CEO), while the LPSM + 1%CEO and LPSM + 1.5%CEO coated beef samples never reached this limit level during refrigeration storage. Accordingly, the microbial shelf lives of 2, 4, 4, 7, and 7 days are predicted for the control, LPSM + 0%CEO, LPSM + 0.5%CEO, LPSM + 1%CEO, and LPSM + 1.5%CEO coated samples, respectively. This might be likely due to the antimicrobial effect of the CEO and oxygen barrier function of the CEO‐rich edible coatings, in accordance with other studies (Alizadeh Behbahani et al.,
