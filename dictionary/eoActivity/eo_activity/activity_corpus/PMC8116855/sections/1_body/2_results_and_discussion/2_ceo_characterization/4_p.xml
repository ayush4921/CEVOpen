<p>Antioxidant capacity is occurred by various mechanisms, which indicates utilizing a method based on one mechanism may not demonstrate the true antioxidant activity (Karadag et al.,

Thus, several antioxidant tests, such as DPPH‐ and ABTS radical scavenging activity and β‐carotene‐linoleic acid model system, were used to measure the antioxidant effect of the CEO. The oil had a DPPH‐radical scavenging effect of 72.95 ± 0.53%, and this remarkably high antioxidant capacity indicates that the CEO has hydrogen/electron ability to reduce DPPH free radicals to nonreactive molecules. The oil was also able to scavenge ABTS radicals by 64.59 ± 0.4%, probably through hydrogen atom and electron transfer mechanisms. It was also observed that the CEO had a moderate inhibitory effect against β‐carotene discoloration (54.5 ± 0.47%) likely via neutralizing linoleate free radicals. The antioxidant activity of chicory extracts and EOs has been reported in the literature (Gol et al.,
