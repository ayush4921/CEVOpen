<p>The edible coating was also able to efficiently inhibit weight loss of the beef slices over time (Figure

Despite the fact that all the samples underwent a significant decrease in moisture content (i.e., higher weight loss) during cold storage, the beef slices coated by the CEO‐enriched LPSM maintained moisture content compared with the noncoated sample. At the end of refrigeration period, the control sample underwent a significant weight loss of about 23.23%, whereas the samples coated by LPSM + 0%CEO, LPSM + 0.5%CEO, LPSM + 1%CEO, and LPSM + 1.5%CEO had lower weight losses of 10.89%, 9.24%, 7.18%, and 7.35%, respectively. The less weight loss by CEO‐loaded LPSM edible coating could be attributed to the water barrier properties of the coating (Ruan et al.,
