<p>The CEO also contained considerable levels of phenolic and flavonoid compounds (73.45 ± 0.7 mg GAE/g and 67.62 ± 0.58 mg QE/g, respectively). The content of total phenolic and flavonoid compounds is indeed dependent on the chicory culture, harvest time, other environmental factors, and extraction method/solvent. Accordingly, the cultivated and wild chicory roots have significantly different total phenolic contents of 35.1 and 22.4 mg GAE/100 g, respectively (Spina et al.,

Indeed, chicory plant is a rich source of phenolic compounds, such as gallic acid, syringic acid, catechin, caffeic acid, vanillic acid, protocatechic acid, ferulic acid, chlorogenic acid, naringin, hesperidin, neohesperidin, myricetin, kaempferol, quercetin, rutin hydrate, and resveratrol (Sahan et al.,
