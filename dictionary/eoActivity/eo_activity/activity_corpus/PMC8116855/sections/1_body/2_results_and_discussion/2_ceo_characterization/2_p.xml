<p>Plant EOs are rich in bioactive compounds with versatile biological functions. In this study, CEO was subjected to GC/MS apparatus to identify and quantify its main chemical constituents. The oil was rich in camphor (31.3%), cymene (18.2%), γ‐terpinene (8.45%), and β‐pinene (7.85%). Other compounds, such as pinene (4.9%), eucalyptol (3.3%), camphene (3.1%), and carvacrol (2.7%), were also found in the CEO at lower concentrations. In accordance with our study, it was reported that the major components of the CEO are camphor (20.74%), cymene (15.06%), γ‐terpinene (13.24%), and cuminal (10.79%) (Gol et al.,

However, the variation found in the concentration and type of the major constituents is due to the fact that the composition of volatile organic compounds is greatly dependent on the genetic factors, harvest time, growing location, storage conditions, nutrients, light, water, and extraction methods (Šaponjac et al.,
