<p>Meat and meat products, due to their suitable pH, fermentable carbohydrate, and high contents of nitrogen, moisture, and fat, are highly prone to chemical and microbial deteriorations, which could affect the texture, flavor, color, and nutritional quality of the related products (Alizadeh Behbahani, Noshad, et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32186-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Currently, hydrocolloid‐based edible coatings are receiving a great deal of research and industrial attention as novel food packaging systems to ameliorate shelf life and quality of food products, through preventing chemical, microbial, and physical damages (Barzegar et al.,
