<p>In this context, essential oils (EOs) are frequently used in food preservation technologies as natural and are generally recognized as safe agents, owing to antimicrobial and antioxidant compounds they carry (Calo et al.,

 <xref rid="fsn32186-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). For example, it has been reported that the lemon/thyme EOs‐enriched chitosan coating maintained higher hardness and color and retarded lipid/protein oxidation and microbial growth in grass carp filled during cold storage (Cai et al.,
