 <italic>Lepidium perfoliatum</italic> (locally called Qodume shahri) is native to Iran, Iraq, Egypt, Arabia, and Pakistan, and its seed mucilage is widely used in traditional medicine to treat whooping cough, dry cough, and lung infections and as a demulcent (Koocheki et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32186-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). It has been reported that the mucilage extracted from 
 <italic>L. perfoliatum</italic> seeds could be used as a stabilizing and thickening agent in food systems for viscosity increment, texture modification, and consistency stabilization purposes (Hesarinejad et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32186-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). It is also noteworthy that the 
 <italic>L. perfoliatum</italic> seed mucilage (LPSM) films have good physicochemical, mechanical, and thermal properties and could be applied as a biodegradable packaging for improving the shelf life of various food products (Seyedi et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32186-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Nonetheless, edible coatings based on polysaccharides have hardly antioxidant and antimicrobial activity themselves; therefore, food‐grade ingredients (e.g., plant‐based antioxidant and antimicrobial components) are commonly added to edible coatings to improve their biological and functional properties (Barzegar et al.,
