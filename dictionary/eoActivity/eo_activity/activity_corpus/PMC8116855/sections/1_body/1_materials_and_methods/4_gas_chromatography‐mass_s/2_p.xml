<p>A gas chromatograph (GC; Agilent 7890A) coupled to a mass spectrometer (MS; Agilent 5975C) was employed for the identification and quantification of the main chemical compounds of the CEO. Briefly, 0.2 µl of the oil was injected to the DB‐5 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm) and the heating rate, ionization energy, helium gas flow rate was set at 5°C/min, 70 eV, and 1 ml/min, respectively. Finally, the retention profiles were obtained and compared with those of know samples which were analyzed under the same conditions (Alizadeh Behbahani &amp; Shahidi,
