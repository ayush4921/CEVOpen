<p>A cylindrical probe was used to compress the beef slices (30% of the sample thickness) at a constant pretest speed, test speed, and post‐test speed of 3, 1, and 3 mm/s, respectively, by a Stable Micro System Texture Analyzer (TA, XT2i). The highest force (N) was reported as the hardness of the beef slices.</p>
