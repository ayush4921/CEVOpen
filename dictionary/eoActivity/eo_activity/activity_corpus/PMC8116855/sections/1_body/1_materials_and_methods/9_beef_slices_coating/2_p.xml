<p>The edible coatings were prepared by mixing LPSM (2 g) and Tween‐80 (1 ml) in distilled water (the volume was made up to 100 ml). The CEO (0, 0.5, 1, and 1.5% v/v) was then added. The beef slices were immersed in the CEO‐LPSM solution for 60 s and then air‐dried for 10 min. The essential oil concentrations and coating treatments were selected according to the preliminary experiments for the beef slices to assure (a) adherence and steadiness of the LPSM coating, (b) antimicrobial and antioxidant activity of the essential oil, and (c) acceptable sensory properties (masking the strong flavor or odor of the essential oil). The coated beef slices were then stored at 4°C for 7 days. The noncoated beef slice was used as control. The samples were designated as control, LPSM + 0%CEO, LPSM + 0.5%CEO, LPSM + 1%CEO, and LPSM + 1.5%CEO.</p>
