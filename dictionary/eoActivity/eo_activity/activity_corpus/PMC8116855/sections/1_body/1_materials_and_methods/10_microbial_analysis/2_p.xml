<p>To determine the microbial load changes of beef slices during display, the slices were firstly mixed and homogenized with 0.1% peptone water in a Stomacher. The slurry was then added to the test tubes containing 0.1% peptone water to prepare subsequent dilutions (10
 <sup>–1</sup> to 10
 <sup>–6</sup>), which were further inoculated into the plates containing culture medium. The following tests were then performed to evaluate the microbial growth during storage (Alizadeh Behbahani, Noshad, et al.,
