<p>The chicory essential oil showed a large number of bioactive compounds with superb antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. The incorporation of chicory essential oil into the 
 <italic>L. perfoliatum</italic> seed mucilage‐based edible coating reduced the beef lipid oxidation and microbial growth more efficiently compared with the oil‐free coating. The bioactive‐loaded edible coating also decreased weight and texture losses during display and improved beef acceptability. Therefore, edible coatings rich in natural compounds with superb antimicrobial and antioxidant effects could be used in animal meat products to ameliorate their shelf life.
