 <italic>Sambucus nigra</italic> L. or commonly called elderberry has been extensively used herb to treat influenza and colds. The research by Kinoshita and colleagues (2012) assessed antiviral activity of concentrated elderberry juice (CJ-E) on human influenza A virus, and results showed that CJ-E exerted relatively strong effect on mice infected with influenza virus [

In order to evaluate the antiviral activity of the juice in vivo, it was subjected to ultrafiltration and anion exchange chromatography. An interesting result of this experiment was the complete suppression of virus replication in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) following oral administration of previously separated and high molecular weight CJ-E fractions to influenza virus-infected mice. To complete these results, data relating to the increase in influenza virus-specific neutralizing serum antibodies and the increase in secretory IgA in BALF and feces were also added. One of the separate high molecular weight fractions, fraction II rich in acidic polysaccharides, was capable of exerting a good defense against virus attack. The authors concluded that the treatment with CJ-E could be considered positively in terms of immune response and with respect to the ability to prevent viral diseases. Meta-analysis synthesized the results of elderberry supplementation on causes of the upper respiratory symptoms while controlling for vaccination status and underlying pathology [
