<p>Peppermint is derived from 
 <italic>Mentha x piperita</italic> and consists of phenolic components including rosmarinic acid and flavonoids such as hesperidin, luteolin and eriocitrin. The volatile components are made of essential oils called menthol and menthone (principal volatile components in the essential oil) that have antimicrobial, antiviral, and antioxidant activity. Li and coworkers (2017) explored the anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>M. piperita</italic> leaves’ ethanolic extracts (MPE) [

Here MPE contained high phenolic acid and flavonoid contents and demonstrated free-radical scavenging activities and high antiviral selectivity activity against RSV (breathing syncytial virus). Furthermore, a significant reduction of the nitric oxide (NO), interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells, were reported [
