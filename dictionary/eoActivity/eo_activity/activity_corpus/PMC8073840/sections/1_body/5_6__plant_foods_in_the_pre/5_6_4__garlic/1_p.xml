<p>Garlic (
 <italic>Allium sativum</italic> L.) has known antiviral activity against human papilloma virus. In placebo-controlled trials it was confirmed that apical application of chloroform garlic extracts resulted in adequate removal of skin warts without recurrence even after 3â€“4 months. Cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus 1, rhinovirus, herpes simplex virus 2, HIV, viral pneumonia, and rotavirus have been tested in a few studies with garlic [

In the case of HIV, ajoene is thought to function by inhibiting processes based on the integrin, while allyl alcohol and diallyl disulfide also have proven effeteness against cells infected with HIV. However, opposite to common belief there are inadequate clinical trials that measure impact of garlic on common cold prevention or treatment [

This result is of particular interest, thus suggesting that garlic essential oil could be a valuable natural anti-virus source, able to prevent the invasion of coronavirus into the human body [
