<p>Licorice (
 <italic>
  <italic>Glycyrrhiza uralensis</italic>
 </italic>) is a commonly used herb for centuries in traditional Chinese medicine, containing approximately 20 triterpenoids and 300 flavonoids. Numerous studies demonstrated that among others, these metabolites have antimicrobial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antitumor pharmacological functions. Licorice has an antiviral property against hepatitis C virus, herpes simplex virus, Coxsackievirus B3 and A16, influenza virus H5N1, enterovirus 71, rotavirus and human respiratory syncytial virus 30. Glycyrrhizin isolated from 
 <italic>G. glabra</italic> and 
 <italic>G. uralensis</italic> is one of the principles tested on patients with SARS-CoV infection at the time of the outbreak in 2002 [

The authors of this study showed that glycyrrhizin effectively inhibited SARS-CoV replication on Vero cells in addition to blocking the adsorption and penetration of the virus. Furthermore, glycyrrhizin possesses a powerful activity against the influenza A virus (H5N1), reducing the ability of H5N1 to influence the production of chemokine and interleukin (IL-6) [

Researchers explored the antiviral properties of licorice root extracts and found that extracts had a higher anti-HIV activity than water extracts. On the other hand, the water extract, in particular the flavonoid-rich fraction, showed a higher antiviral activity against HSV than the alkaline extract. The flavonoid fraction showed greater cytotoxicity for human oral squamous cell carcinoma lines compared to normal cells [
