<p>The blackberry is an edible berry of Rosaceae family, genus Rubus. Although it is a fairly common fruit, its main production is in North America, Europe, Asia, South America, Oceania, Central America and Africa [

The fruits of this plant are rich in biologically active substances and class of polyphenols is very well represented with large quantities of phenolic acids such as gallic acid, flavonoids such as quercetin, complex structures such as tannins and ellagitannins as well as anthocyanins and cyanidins.

Besides the phenolic compounds, this fruit is also rich in carbohydrates (such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose), organic acids (such as malic acid), and minerals (mainly potassium). However, it is important to highlight that chemical composition is strictly related to several factors, such as variety, growing conditions, stage of ripeness, harvest and storage conditions. Regarding the potential antiviral activity, [
 <xref rid="B331-pharmaceuticals-14-00381" ref-type="bibr">331</xref>] evaluated antiviral effects of blackberry extracts against HSV type 1; the authors demonstrated that blackberry extract (≥56 µg/mL) inhibited the early stages of HSV-1 replication in oral epithelial cells by &gt;99%, showing potent virucidal activity. However, there are few other available evidences in scientific literature regarding the exploitation of blackberry extracts as antiviral agents. Therefore, further research in this sense seems to be worthwhile. On the other hand, other available reports on different wild berries showed that strawberry and raspberry (
 <italic>Rosaceae</italic>) together with bilberry and lingonberry (
 <italic>Ericaceae</italic>) extracts are potential inhibitors of several viruses that are important human pathogens. In this regard, [
 <xref rid="B332-pharmaceuticals-14-00381" ref-type="bibr">332</xref>] has been demonstrated that the previously reported plant extracts (according to their specific anthocyanin composition) were all able to inhibit the replications of both CV-B1 and influenza A virus.
