<p>Rosemary (
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> L.) is a medicinal plant that is native to Mediterranean but cultivated in all parts of the world. Rosemary has bioactive phytomolecules with anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antiproliferative, antioxidant, and antitumor pharmacological activities. Antiviral activity is mostly derived from chemical compounds as rosmarinic acid and eucalyptol, while it was earlier reported that triterpenoids, as oleanolic acid (OA) and its analogues, were carriers of the antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antitumor and anticancer properties. OA is relatively non-toxic and conversion of its functional hydroxyl and carboxylic acid groups results with active and potent antiviral compounds. Synthesized compounds had antiviral activity against HIV via inhibition of HIV-1 replication. They also impeded entry of influenza virus to host cells by the inhibition of binding of hemagglutinin protein. There were also few reports of potential OA reactions against hepatitis B virus [
