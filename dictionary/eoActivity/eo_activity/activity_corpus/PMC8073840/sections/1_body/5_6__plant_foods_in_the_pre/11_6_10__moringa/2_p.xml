<p>To date, in the context of African Traditional Medicine, this medicinal plant is among the most used by herbalist and medics to treat or manage disease of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). There are many positive feedbacks on its effectiveness in improving quality of patients’ lives and the ability to induce improvements of HIV/AIDS disease. From this point of view, to evaluate antiretroviral activity of different extracts of M. oleifera, Nworu and collaborators [
 <xref rid="B321-pharmaceuticals-14-00381" ref-type="bibr">321</xref>], used a specific antiviral screening technique, demonstrating that three different extracts of M. oleifera were able to inhibit infectious power of HIV-1 lentiviral particles. In a recent research, [
 <xref rid="B322-pharmaceuticals-14-00381" ref-type="bibr">322</xref>] the antiviral activity of aqueous extracts of M. oleifera leaves was evaluated on Huh7 cell line. In particular, these extracts were able to modulate the pgRNA levels and HBsAg secretion positively in Huh7 cells transfected with genotypes C and H of HBV. In a study published in 2017, [
 <xref rid="B323-pharmaceuticals-14-00381" ref-type="bibr">323</xref>], the authors assessed the potential of 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> and 
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> Lam. against herpes simplex viruses. Interestingly, the results showed that the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic>, at a concentration of 200 μg/mL, inhibited herpes simplex type 1 and type 2 by 43.2% and 21.4%, respectively. Instead, the 100 μg/mL rosemary extract inhibited herpes simplex type 1 by 18.9% and was not active against HSV-2, so the authors concluded that 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> extract was more effective than rosemary as antiviral agent against herpes simplex viruses. In an in vitro investigation on BHK-21 cell line, the ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> leaves, at different concentrations, showed significant anti-Food and Mouth Disease Virus (FMDV) activity. Specifically, the findings indicated that six concentrations 1 μg/mL up to 100 μg/mL were safe for the considered cell culture (cell survival &gt; 50%) and exhibited significant antiviral activity. The authors conclude that probably Niaziminin or another member of the thiocarbamate group, could be responsible for the reported antiviral activity. To date, also considering the data shown above, many authors seem to agree that Moringa can be considered a very promising alternative to conventional antiviral drugs.
