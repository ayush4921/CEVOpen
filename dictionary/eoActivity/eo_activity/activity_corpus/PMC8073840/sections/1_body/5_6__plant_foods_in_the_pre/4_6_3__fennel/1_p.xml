<p>Previous studies have shown the existence of numerous valuable compounds that are obtained from 
 <italic>Foeniculum vulgare</italic> Mill. (fennel), including flavonoids, volatile compounds, fatty acids, phenolic compounds, and amino acids. The collected data demonstrated their efficacy in many pharmacological properties done in vitro and in vivo, with reported anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antinociceptive, antiviral, antimutagenic, antipyretic, antispasmodic, cardiovascular, apoptotic, antithrombotic, antitumor, hepatoprotective, chemo modulatory, hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic action. Orhan and colleagues focused on the antiviral function of essential fruit oil from Fennel. Most of the oils exerted significant antiviral activity against HSV-1 when administered in range from 0.8 –0.025 μg/mL, but were less successful against PI-3 in the range from 1.6–0.2 μg/mL [
