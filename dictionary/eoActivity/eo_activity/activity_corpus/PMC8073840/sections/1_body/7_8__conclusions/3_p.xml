<p>Natural compounds can be explored and used as sources for pharmaceuticals by combining newer methods/aspects of drug discovery. The process of drug discovery involves a series of steps including its identification and isolation from the corresponding plant extract, subsequently followed by purification and, finally, verification by clinical trials. Nowadays, pharmaceutical production is also focused of the biologically active compounds obtained by recombinant processes and metabolic engineering. New frontier with tremendous health implications that already received lots of attention within pharmaceutical sciences, relates to nanomedicines. Nanotechnology aims to develop simple, stable and cost-effective nanoparticles that are useful as drug delivery systems. The development of natural drugs for the near future cannot neglect the modern concept of drug delivery, which is essential to ensure correct bioavailability of the new drug.</p>
