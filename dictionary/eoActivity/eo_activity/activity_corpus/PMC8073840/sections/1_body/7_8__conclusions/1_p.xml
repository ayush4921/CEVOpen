<p>Viruses are the obligate parasites that are composed of genetic material that can be either in the form of DNA or RNA. The hostâ€™s cell replicates viruses, thus harming the host organism with viral infections. Viral infections are the most fatal forms of diseases and some forms of them still cannot be completely treated (e.g., hepatitis and HIV), hence development of life prolonging drugs can be of major importance in human health. Although vaccination policies are the most relevant and effective weapons for the control of viral attacks, however it must be taken into account that specific vaccines are not always available and still today many viral infections, often of an endemic nature are present in the world. In light of this, it is of vital importance to open the horizons of modern medicine to new therapeutic potentials such as the use of principles coming from plants. The possibility of using common plants, used for food purposes, to recover biologically active compounds or plant extracts with relevant biological properties, could represent a challenge of great interest for the future of pharmaceutical sciences. History teaches us that viral infections can be treated by antiviral drugs obtained from traditional sources of medicine as plants. Herbal extracts with phytochemicals can inhibit the process of replication at any of the steps in the viral replication cycle. Plants are the major sources of secondary metabolites which can be used for the synthesis of the antiviral medications along with genetic engineering.</p>
