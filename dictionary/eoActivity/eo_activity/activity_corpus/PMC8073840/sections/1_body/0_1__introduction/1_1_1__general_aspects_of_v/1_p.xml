<p>The study of the different existing viruses represents always a hot research topic, as they are considered the leading causes of mortality and morbidity around the world and pose an ongoing threat to public health. This is mainly due to high infectious capacity of many viruses, which is correlated with their specific nature. Viruses are defined as the obligate and intracellular parasites which are comprised of strands of genetic information either in the form of DNA or RNA and are enclosed via lipid core or envelope [

The specific feature involves the use of the host cell to propagate and replicate new viruses through the process of acquiring the reproductive tools of the host cell. Hence, this causes cell invasion which leads to ailments such as bloody African fever [

The attributed characteristics of viruses include their genetic variation, mode of transmission, replication inside host cells and capability to persist inside the host body. The therapeutic as well as prophylactic measures can be used in order to alleviate and regulate the level of infections caused by viruses. Viruses are not autonomous in nature, hence they necessitate a host body or living cell for the process of replication [
