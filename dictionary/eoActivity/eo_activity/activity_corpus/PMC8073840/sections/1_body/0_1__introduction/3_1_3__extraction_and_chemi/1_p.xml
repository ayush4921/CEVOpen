<p>Plants and plant foods are known as major sources from which to extract secondary metabolites that can be employed for the synthesis of the same via their metabolic pathway along with the concept of genetic engineering [

Currently, epidemiological studies have demonstrated the health promoting potential of phytochemicals from fruits and vegetables, as well as their association with a lower risk for chronic diseases (e.g., cancer and cardiovascular diseases) [

One of the major issues in therapeutic use of plants and plant extracts is their standardization, i.e., making methods for their production reproducible in order to always ensure same dosage of bioactive compounds. In this sense, a correct choice of method of extraction and characterization of phytochemicals from vegetable sources, becomes indispensable. In this regard, the impact of new extraction methods to recover high value-added compounds from plant materials, should be considered a focal point for obtaining extracts with high nutraceutical quality [
 <xref rid="B6-pharmaceuticals-14-00381" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The application of a specific extraction technique must be studied based on the nature of plant matrix to be treated (i.e., leaves, fruit, berries, roots, and tubers). It is always useful to apply techniques that guarantee both quantitative and qualitative recovery of phytochemicals, especially when it is necessary to extract thermolabile or easily oxidizable principles. In this case we should turn to those non-conventional techniques that work by reducing the extraction time and therefore reducing the phenomena of degradation of the phytochemicals [

 <xref rid="B9-pharmaceuticals-14-00381" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Likewise, it is of fundamental importance to have a wide range of analytical tools available for the identification and quantification of the phytochemicals present in the plant matrix. The main techniques used for separation of phytochemicals comprises of column chromatography, flash chromatography, thin layer chromatography (TLC), high performance thin layer chromatography (HP-TLC) and high-performance liquid chromatography HPLC, while ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) and (infrared) IR spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), mass spectrometry (MS), etc. are currently used for identification by means structural elucidation. The well-known bioactive molecule can be identified from numerous chemical libraries and these chemicals undergo screening method for further assurance, while through mass spectrometry, NMR and the study of the spectral characteristics of the molecules it is possible to discover new compounds from different sources.
