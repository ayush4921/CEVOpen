<p>Regarding other classes of phenolics, 6-gingerol (belonging to the phenolic sub-class of hydroxyphenylpropenes) is a phytochemical found in fresh ginger rhizome (
 <italic>Zingiber officinale</italic>). 6-Gingerol has been previously described as a promising drug candidate to treat various diseases associated with inflammation, cancer, and viral disease [

(2020), with the aim to develop structure-based drugs from photochemical compounds and to search for inhibitors against the viral proteins of the corona virus (SARS CoV-2), revealed that 6-gingerol could act as a promising drug of choice to treat COVID-19 disease [

In fact, the molecular docking studies showed that 6-gingerol possessed excellent pharmacokinetic properties with the highest binding affinity ranging from −2.8764 KJ/mol to −15.7591 KJ/mol with various COVID-19 viral protein targets.
