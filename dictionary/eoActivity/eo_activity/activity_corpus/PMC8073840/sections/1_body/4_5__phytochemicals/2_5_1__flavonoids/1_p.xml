<p>Flavonoids in the form of flower pigments from families of flowering plants/angiosperms contain polyphenols with a skeleton of 15-Carbon atoms [
 <xref rid="B197-pharmaceuticals-14-00381" ref-type="bibr">197</xref>]. The skeleton consists of C6-C3-C6 system, but in few cases the heterocyclic six-member ring is replaced via 5-membered ring. Since flavonoids comprises of plethora of variously correlated compounds from a chemical point of view, they have been classified into various subclasses based on some chemical characteristics inherent in their structure. Specifically, for the classification of these compounds, the carbon of the C ring on which the B ring is attached was taken into account, as well as degree of unsaturation / oxidation of the C ring [
 <xref rid="B197-pharmaceuticals-14-00381" ref-type="bibr">197</xref>]. When ring B is connected in position 3 of ring C these compounds are called isoflavones. If the B ring is linked in position 4, they are classified as neoflavonoids, finally if the B ring is linked in position 2, they can be classified into various subclasses which include flavones, flavonols, flavanones, flavanonols, also flavan- 3- oils, anthocyanins, chalcones and dihydrochalcones. Flavonoids are major source of antiviral agents by inhibiting numerous enzymes, this includes xanthine oxidase, Ca2+-ATPase, cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase and aldose reductase [
