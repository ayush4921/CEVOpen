<p>Derivatives of flavonoids that mainly occur via migration of phenyl group from C-2 to C-3 include various compounds as isoflavones, isoflavanones, isoflavans, and isoflavones. Isoflavones were mainly found in family of 
 <italic>leguminosae</italic> and their in vitro microbial testing showed considerable antiviral effect [
 <xref rid="B228-pharmaceuticals-14-00381" ref-type="bibr">228</xref>]. Isoflavanones differ from isoflavones only due to the presence of a chiral center; naturally obtained prenylated isoflavanones from 
 <italic>Bolus Harms</italic> had noticeable activity against HIV [
