 <xref rid="B284-pharmaceuticals-14-00381" ref-type="bibr">284</xref>]. Studies have reported that it can have potentiating action against wide range of pathogens and its subtypes. Salicylic acid can act via inhibiting the stages of replication, long distance movement and cell-to-cell movement in viruses. It was reported by the evidence that it stimulates the downstream pathway that can lead to induction of mechanism of resistance based on RNA interferences [

 <xref rid="B286-pharmaceuticals-14-00381" ref-type="bibr">286</xref>]. It has been attributed to a synthetic derivative of chlorophyll, chlorophyllin (CHLN), an antimutagenic activity against numerous environmental contaminants. Botelho and co-workers (2004) reported the ability of this compound to prevent nuclear fragmentation (NF) in polio virus-infected HEp-2 liver cells. [
