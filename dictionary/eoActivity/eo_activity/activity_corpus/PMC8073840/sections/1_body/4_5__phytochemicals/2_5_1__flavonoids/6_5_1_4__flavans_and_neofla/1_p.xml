<p>Flavans consist in a 2-phenyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-chromene skeleton. These compounds do not have carbonyl group at 2nd position, such as catechin and epicatechin. The flavans can be divided, in turn, into flavan-3-ols, flavan-4-ols and flavan-3,4-diols. Remarkable biological and pharmacological properties are ascribed to these compounds, and mainly to catechin and its derivatives such as epicatechin, epicatechin gallate, epigallocatechin (EGC) and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) are attributed antiviral properties. These compounds are mainly abundant in tea [

 <xref rid="B223-pharmaceuticals-14-00381" ref-type="bibr">223</xref>]. In this regard, tea catechins have been subjected to several studies, mainly as related to the inhibition of influenza virus. Interestingly, a structure-activity analysis of tea catechins demonstrated the pivotal role of the 3-gallolyl group as related to their antiviral activity [
