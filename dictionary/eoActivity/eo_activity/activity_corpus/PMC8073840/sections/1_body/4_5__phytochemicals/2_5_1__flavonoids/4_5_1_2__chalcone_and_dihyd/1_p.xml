<p>Another important sub-class among flavonoids is represented by chalcones [

Chalcones are aromatic ketones with two aromatic rings bonded through a three-carbon α, β-unsaturated carbonyl system. Their formation derives from substitution reactions of 1,3-diphenylpropenone and from the compounds derived from it. They are precursors of flavonoids and isoflavonoids, abundantly found inside edible plants. These compounds have been studied as related to the inhibition of human rhinoviruses and plant viruses and the activity relies on substitution patterns. The antiviral activity against tomato ringspot nepovirus (ToRSV) was investigated via Onyilagha and his co-workers using chalcones that are hydroxy and methoxy substituted. The hydroxylation at 2′, 3′, 4′ positions of ring B and at C-4 of ring A promotes antiviral activity against ToRS virus [
