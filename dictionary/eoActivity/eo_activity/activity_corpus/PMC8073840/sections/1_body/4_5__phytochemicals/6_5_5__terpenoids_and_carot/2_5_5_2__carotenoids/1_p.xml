<p>Carotenoids are classified under the category of tetraterpenoids, they are composed of hydrocarbons due to the association of several isoprene units. The carotenoids are derived from polyene chain with four carbons that serve as its backbone. These compounds are characterized by a system of conjugated double bonds, which is mainly responsible for some of the reported bioactive properties [

In recent research, it was found that a C50-series carotenoid, bacterioruberin, was more effective than conventional drugs commonly used to fight HCV and HBV in mononuclear blood cells of infected patients. Specifically, this molecule appears to inhibit the antiviral activity of HCV RNA and HBV DNA polymerases, thereby ensuring the suppression of HCV and HBV replication.
