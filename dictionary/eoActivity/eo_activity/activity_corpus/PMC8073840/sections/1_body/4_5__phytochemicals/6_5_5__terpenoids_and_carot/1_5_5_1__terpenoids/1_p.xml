<p>Terpenoids are diverse class of naturally occurring organic chemicals with various biological properties [

 <xref rid="B253-pharmaceuticals-14-00381" ref-type="bibr">253</xref>] that are also known as isoprenoids. Terpenoids can be considered derivatives of mevalonic acid consisting of isoprene units. These molecules are widespread in nature and are usually extracted from plants. The gibberellins, components of this class, are essential in the growth and development of plants, while the carotenoid compounds are mainly related to photosynthetic processes. The phytoalexins, on the other hand, are important as they regulate the defense mechanisms of plants towards the environment. Several volatile terpenoids are variously used, for example menthol and peryl alcohol are used to produce spices, aromatic substances and cosmetics, while pyrethrins and limonoids are used as pesticides or industrial raw materials. Some compounds with a sesquiterpene character such as farnesene or bisabolene and monoterpenic such as pinene and limonene, can be considered fuel precursors. Generally, terpenoid substances are classified according to their chemical structure, and specifically, according to the number of isoprene units. So, we have monoterpenes (C10), sesquiterpenes (C15), diterpenes (C20), triterpenes (C30), tetraterpenes (C40) and polyterpenes (C &gt; 40). It should also be taken into account that these compounds can also occur as oxygen-containing derivatives such as alcohols, aldehydes, carboxylic acids, ketones, esters and glycosides.
