 <xref rid="B287-pharmaceuticals-14-00381" ref-type="bibr">287</xref>] it was reported that carrageenans (molecular weight: 3, 5 and 10 kDa), and its acetylated and sulphate derivatives, were capable of acting against the influenza virus and HIV by means of depolymerization and sulfation. This meant that small molecules such as sulfated polysaccharides could be considered as potential antivirals [
