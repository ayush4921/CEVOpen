<p>A specific group of terpenoids, namely the pentacyclic triterpenoids, composed by three terpene units was found to exert antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral activities [
 <xref rid="B254-pharmaceuticals-14-00381" ref-type="bibr">254</xref>]. In this regard, oleanolic, betulinic, and ursolic acids are representative pentacyclic triterpenoids showing a broad antiviral spectrum. Moreover, glycyrrhizin (and its analogues) has been studied as anti-HIV agents according to their different target (i.e., entry inhibitors, reverse transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, maturation inhibitors, and bifunctional inhibitors). The antiviral activity of compounds belonging to the monoterpenes class has been extensively evaluated and some components such as isoborneol and borneol, have shown a high activity towards HSV-1. In this regard, isoborneol was found to have a total inhibition of HSV-1 replication already at a concentration of 0.06% [
