<p>Anthocyanins represent one of the most important class among flavonoids, mainly related to a great range of colors in the plant kingdom [
 <xref rid="B204-pharmaceuticals-14-00381" ref-type="bibr">204</xref>]. Anthocyanidins, i.e., the aglycones, are characterized by a benzyl ring (A) linked to a heterocyclic ring with oxygen function (C), which is also attached to a third benzyl ring (B). The part C can be linked to parts A and B with three carbon bridges [

Besides, the sugar moiety can be found at 3 or 5 positions or both, including monosaccharides, as well as di-saccharides, and tri- saccharides, which could possess acylated side chains. The database Phenol-Explorer reports 71 compounds in different foods, with the highest levels of information available for cyanidin 3-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside and malvidin 3-
 <italic>O-</italic>glucoside. The antiviral activities of anthocyanins-enriched plants is well documented and reviewed; in this regard, several compounds (mainly glycosidic forms of cyanidin and delphinidin) and have been related to antiviral action against InfV A and B, HSV-1, RV, CV-B1, Adenovirus 36, BT2, T4 and simian rotavirus SA-11, avian InfV, HAV, FCV-F9 and MNV-1 [

Although, therefore, many scientific evidence asses the antiviral properties of this class of polyphenolic substances, it should be pointed out, however, that anthocyanins are extremely unstable compounds, highly prone to oxidation mechanisms. Furthermore, their stability is tremendously affected by external factors, such as temperature or pH, which could affect their antiviral activities [
 <xref rid="B207-pharmaceuticals-14-00381" ref-type="bibr">207</xref>]. In this regard, several technologies (such as those based on nanomedicine) are trying to overcome these limitations to improve the delivery of anthocyanins to the targeted site of action. Intriguingly, some authors demonstrated that encapsulating these phenolics into nanoparticles plays a significant role in improving their antiviral properties [
