<p>Resveratrol belongs to the phenolic class of stilbenes. This phenolic compound characterizes mostly fermented grapes, mulberry, red wine, and peanuts, and it exists as both trans- and/or cis- isomer [

 <xref rid="B236-pharmaceuticals-14-00381" ref-type="bibr">236</xref>], mainly related to its radical scavenging potential. Besides, it acts as prophylactic compound against cancers and viral infections. Resveratrol is certainly the most studied stilbene for its high biological and pharmacological properties and not least its antiviral activity. Several researches have been devoted to the discovery of the mechanisms of action by which this compound exerts this activity on different types of viruses such as influenza, hepatitis C, RSV, HSV, HIV [

Overall, a treatment with resveratrol demonstrated remarkable recession of the viral infection, excepting for multiple sclerosis and hepatitis C infections. Resveratrol was studied in a research conducted by Lin and coauthors in which they confirmed the antiviral activity of the molecule by testing it in vitro towards MERS-CoV, using Vero E6 cells as a cell model. In particular, the authors reported, as a relevant result, a prolongation of the survival of the cell line used after it was infected by MERS-CoV. In particular, this compound caused a reduced expression of nucleocapsid protein (essential for MERS-CoV replication). Besides, resveratrol was found to down-regulate the apoptosis induced by MERS-CoV in vitro, thus demonstrating a very promising role as antiviral agent against MERS-CoV infection. In a recent research the potential anti-rotavirus activity of resveratrol was investigated [

In this in vivo study performed on mice, resveratrol was able to reduce the mRNA expression levels of mainly proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin-2, interleukin-10, tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ at the level of the intestinal tissue of animals. These results confirmed the antiviral activity of resveratrol and could be a promising treatment for rotavirus infection.
