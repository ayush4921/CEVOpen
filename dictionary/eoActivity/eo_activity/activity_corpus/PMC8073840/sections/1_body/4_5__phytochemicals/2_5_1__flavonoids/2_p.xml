<p>Flavonoids are one of the most important and studied phenolic compounds. These phytochemicals are plant secondary metabolites and are widely found in different food matrices, such as fruits, vegetables and certain beverages [
 <xref rid="B199-pharmaceuticals-14-00381" ref-type="bibr">199</xref>]. In the last years, flavonoids have been described as related to several favorable biochemical and antioxidant effects, such as, among the others, those associated with cancer, Alzheimerâ€™s disease, diabetes, and atherosclerosis [

 <xref rid="B201-pharmaceuticals-14-00381" ref-type="bibr">201</xref>]. Besides, flavonoids are important components in several nutraceutical, pharmaceutical, medicinal, and cosmetic applications. In fact, the health-promoting properties of these compounds are usually coupled with their potential inhibition/modulation of key cellular enzymes [

 <xref rid="B203-pharmaceuticals-14-00381" ref-type="bibr">203</xref>]. Overall, flavonoids have been studied for their potential antiviral activities and promising results have emerged from both in vitro and even in vivo studies. The next sub-paragraphs summarize the up-to-date evidences for antiviral activity of different flavonoids, together with the cellular and molecular mechanisms of action of these bioactive on viruses.
