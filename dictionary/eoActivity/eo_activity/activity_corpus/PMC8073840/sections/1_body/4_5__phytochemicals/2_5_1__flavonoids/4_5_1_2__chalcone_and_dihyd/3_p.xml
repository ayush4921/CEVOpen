<p>Since 1980, another life-threatening issue caused by virus is AIDS due to HIV. Xanthohumol commonly found in hops, serves as a potent inhibitor of enzyme reverse transcriptase thereby inhibiting the process of viral replication [

Buckwold and his coworkers examined antiviral action of a xanthohumol enriched extracts of hops against herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) and rhinovirus (rhino) [

The anti-HIV action has also been described for lycocalcones A 1A, B-76, specifically it has been reported that these compounds, together with 3,3′, 4,4′-tetrahydroxy-2-methoxicalcone, acted against virus by suppressing the TPA-induced HIV promoter by promoting binding to specific proteins [
