<p>Indeed, tannins showed a variety of biological effects, including antiviral activity [
 <xref rid="B244-pharmaceuticals-14-00381" ref-type="bibr">244</xref>]. In this regard, it must be emphasized that these molecules are capable of acting against many viruses including influenza virus A, HIV, HSV and rotavirus. Overall, the most of antiviral activities are reported for ellagitannins (belonging to hydrolysable tannins. The ellagitannins extracted and isolated from 
 <italic>Phyllanthus urinaria</italic> and 
 <italic>Phyllanthus myrtifolius</italic> have been reported to show antiviral activity against Epstein-Barr virus. There is various scientific evidence regarding the antiviral activity of some hydrolysable tannins such as chebulagic acid and punicalagin, in fact the inhibitory action on HCV is ascribed to them. Furthermore, through in vitro experiments, the inhibiting action of strictinin on the replication of the human, swine and duck influenza A virus has been highlighted. [

 <italic>Tuberaria lignosa</italic> inhibited HIVâ€™s entry into MT-2 cells, likely suppressing HIV replication by acting on reverse transcriptase [

 <xref rid="B244-pharmaceuticals-14-00381" ref-type="bibr">244</xref>]. Overall, ellagitannins from plants belonging to 
 <italic>Phyllanthus</italic> present antiviral activity against Epstein-Barr virus [
