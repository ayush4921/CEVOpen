<p>The reduction of double bonds at C4 carbonyl carbon is responsible for the formation of flavanones. Abyssinone II is a naturally occurring flavanone with antiviral activity against HSV-1 that was tested on Hela 5 cells by recombinant α-galactosidase strains of HSV-1 [

They show hepatoprotective and antiviral activity against mycotic infection, auto-immune disease and hepatitis B [

The database Phenol-Explorer reports 78 compounds included in this sub-class, with the 32% belonging to quercetin and its glycosidic forms, rutin. In this regard, among flavonols, the antiviral effects of quercetin were the most widely investigated [

Interestingly, quercetin, inhibits the process of replication of various viruses and helps with treatment of pathogenic viral infections like rhinovirus, mayaro virus, influenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory encephalitis poliovirus type 1, HSV-1, HSV-2 and RSV in a dose-dependent manner [
 <xref rid="B186-pharmaceuticals-14-00381" ref-type="bibr">186</xref>]. Several studies have focused on determining the mechanism of action of quercetin. Hung and coauthors (2015) proposed some mechanisms for the antiviral activity of quercetin against HSV [
 <xref rid="B224-pharmaceuticals-14-00381" ref-type="bibr">224</xref>], and in particular they considered both the ability of this compound to block virus binding and the ability to penetrate the host cell. Furthermore, in this same research, it was reported that one of the mechanisms by which quercetin could express its antiviral potential towards HSV was its ability to suppress NF-κB activation. Another proposed mechanism of action is by inhibiting the activity of numerous heat shock proteins (HSP). They are produced in response to cellular exposure to stress and are responsible for process of translation via nonstructural protein 5A-mediated viral internal ribosome entry site or Ns5A-mediated viral IRES translation. Another potential mechanism targets inhibition of an enzyme HCV NS3 protease which is responsible for viral replication inside the host cells [
