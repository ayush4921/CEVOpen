<p>Deng and coworkers studied the antiviral effects of chalcone 3 [

 <xref rid="B213-pharmaceuticals-14-00381" ref-type="bibr">213</xref>]. The results of this in vivo study confirmed significant anti-TMV and anti-CMV activity related to these compounds. These are the derived products obtained from chalcones by the reduction of the double bonds that disrupted its ability to from normal chalcone pharmacophore. Mars studied a set of synthetically generated chalcones, reported a potential antiviral activity against hepatitis C virus [
