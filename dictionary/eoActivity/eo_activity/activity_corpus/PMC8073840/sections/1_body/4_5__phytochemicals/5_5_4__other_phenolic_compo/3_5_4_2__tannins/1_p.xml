<p>Tannins are high molecular weight phenolic compounds that have hydroxyl groups, as well as various others, including carboxylic group supports formation of a strong natural complexes. The classification of tannins is based on their ability to undergo hydrolysis. The non-hydrolysable ones are attributable to the structure of flavan-3-oils, and are made up of proanthocyanidins, mainly catechin and epicatechin. This type of tannins can have a different degree of polymerization as well as a different bond arrangement and hydroxylation pattern. Instead, among the tannins that undergo hydrolysis, called precisely hydrolysable, there are gallotannins and ellagitannins, composed mainly of a gallic acid or an ellagic acid, respectively, which by means of ester bonds reach a degree of polymerization even high. Both the very different chemical dimensions, due to the varying degree of polymerization, and their stereochemistry are the main chemical characteristics that define the great chemical diversity within this class of molecules to which their various health properties are related [
