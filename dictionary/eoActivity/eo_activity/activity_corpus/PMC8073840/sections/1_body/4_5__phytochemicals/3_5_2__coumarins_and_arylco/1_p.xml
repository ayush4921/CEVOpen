<p>Another interesting group of phenolic compounds that contains carbonyl functional group at C2 is coumarin, previously reported to exert antiviral activity [
 <xref rid="B233-pharmaceuticals-14-00381" ref-type="bibr">233</xref>]. Coumarins are considered good candidates for designing novel antiviral agents. In particular, these compounds have gained great attention in the last years for their correlation with orally bioavailable non-peptidic antiviral agents [
 <xref rid="B233-pharmaceuticals-14-00381" ref-type="bibr">233</xref>]. The most important coumarin derivatives reported as antiviral drugs belong to the class of 4-hydroxycoumarins, arylcoumarins, pyranocoumarins, furanocoumarins, 3-phenylcoumarins, 4-phenylcoumarins, coumarin-benzimidazoles conjugates, anilinocoumarins, 7-hydroxycoumarin analogues, coumestans, and toddacoumaquinone. Overall, most of the coumarin-derivatives have been linked to the antiviral-activity spectra on HIV type 1, acting as alternative to peptidomimetics. Among these compounds, the most described and presenting a clinical valence are warfarine analogues, tetramers of 4-hydroxycoumarins, khellactone, and calanolide. Besides, there are several studies showing the inhibitory role of coumarin derivatives against infection of Influenza, Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16). Overall, coumarins inhibit proteins essential for viral entry, replication, and infection, acting also as regulators of cellular pathways [
