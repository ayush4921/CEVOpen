<p>Another naturally occurring bioflavonoid is myricetin that exerts action against hepatitis B, coronavirus and influenza virus [

 <xref rid="B228-pharmaceuticals-14-00381" ref-type="bibr">228</xref>] it seems that myricetin is able to influence the ATPase activity of the viral helicase, thus promoting an antiviral action against the SARS coronavirus. Moreover, myricetin was related to an effective inhibitory activity against hepatitis B and influenza virus [

 <xref rid="B227-pharmaceuticals-14-00381" ref-type="bibr">227</xref>] showed that glycosylation might enhance the anti-HIV-1 activity of myricetin, enabling a better internalization of this compound into the cell, then acting on the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. Flavonoids that act as reverse transcriptase inhibitors, as myricetin (3,3′,4′,5,5′,7-hexahydroxyflavone), baicalein (5,6,7 trihydroxyflavone) and quercetagetin (3,3′,4′,5,6,7hexahydroxyflavone) are abundantly available from natural sources found in nuts, berries, vegetables and fruits. Since various steps involved in the development of rhinoviruses includes viral genome transcriptions and protein synthesis, they can be used in treatment of HIV and Rauscher murine leukemia viruses. Glucuronide of baicalein is baicalin which shows its antiviral activity against dengue virus, enterovirus.
