<p>Lignans showed diverse pharmacological properties, including their antiviral activities. In a recent review by Cui et al. [
 <xref rid="B242-pharmaceuticals-14-00381" ref-type="bibr">242</xref>], lignans have been classified in two main groups according to their chemical similarity, being “classical lignans” and “neolignans”. The most studied classical lignans belong to the sub-class of dibenzylbutanes, namely nordihydroguaiaretic acid and niranthin. Nordihydroguaiaretic acid was firstly isolated from the leaves of 
 <italic>Larrea tridentata</italic>. This compound was reported as antiviral agent against numerous viruses including HSV-1, HSV-2, HIV along with human papilloma. Besides, niranthin (firstly isolated from 
 <italic>Phyllanthus niruri</italic> Linn) was studied as related to a potential anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) activity. Among the lignans, worthy of note is niranthin, capable of inhibiting the replication of HBV DNA and the expression of the antigen of the same virus. Other sub-classes of lignan compounds reported to present anti-viral activities are dibenzylbutyrolactones (such as ATG, yatein, and hinokinin), arylnaphthalenes, aryltetralins, substituted tetrahydrofurans (including lariciresinol), 2,6-diarylfurofurans (including sesamin), and dibenzocyclooctenes (including compounds from the plant Schisandraceae family). Regarding neolignans, the most studied group consists in 1,4-benzodioxane lignans; in this regard, the major compound, namely silymarin, has been documented as active antiviral agent against HCV and other viruses. Overall, extensive and detailed information regarding their mechanism of action and potential target can be found in [
