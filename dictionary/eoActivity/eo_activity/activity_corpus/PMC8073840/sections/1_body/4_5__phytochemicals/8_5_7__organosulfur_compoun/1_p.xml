<p>Another large family of active compounds present in the plant world is represented by glucosinolates. They are present in the genus Brassica (Cruciferous), and represent the first precursors of isothiocyanates. In fact, glucosinolates undergoing chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis are able to generate isothiocyanates and thiocyanates in turn molecules with important biological activities. Overall, the organosulfur compounds group includes not only isothiocyanates, but also indoles, allylic sulfur compounds, and sulforaphane. These compounds are widely known for their unique health-promoting properties. In this regard, their antioxidant antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities are already known. These compounds are particularly active against chronic diseases, especially in light of the beneficial effects due to their ability to reduce the level of low-density lipoproteins and carcinogens or toxic agents. Many vegetables belonging to the Allium and Brassica genus such as garlic, onion and broccoli, are primary sources of organosulfur compounds. Plants from 
 <italic>Allium</italic> family synthesize some major classes of antiviral compounds. The main limitation for the use of organosulfur compounds is their pungent odor together with the chemical instabilities, which are characteristics mainly attributable to diallyl sulfides. However, some compounds with a less pronounced odor compounds, such as S-allyl cysteine or S-allyl-mercapto-cysteine are also important constituents of garlic and showed strong bioactive properties [

Organosulfur compounds like allicin, diallyl trisulfide and ajoene are the major phytochemicals which impart antiviral property to garlic. In particular, ajoene, allyl alcohol, and diallyl disulfide are reported to act against HIV infected cells [
