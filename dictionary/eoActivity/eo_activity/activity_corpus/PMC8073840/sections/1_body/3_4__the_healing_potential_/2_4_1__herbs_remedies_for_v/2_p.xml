<p>Plant extracts commonly contain many classes of compounds and among these alkaloids, terpenes and polyphenols. These three classes represent the most widespread groups of secondary metabolites with biological activity, including the antiviral one studied by cell cultures and in vivo testing. Compounds belonging to these classes are often found in nature also in conjugated form. Along with this, various screening programs were instigated for the evaluation of antiviral activity of phytochemicals and the same was done through in vivo and in vitro assays. Overall, in recent and older literature, we find many examples of plant extracts and natural compounds, that exhibit antiviral activity. Relevant examples are the flavonoid glycoside rutin and its aglycon form, quercetin [
