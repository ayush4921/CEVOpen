<p>In an in vitro study on HepG2 cells conducted by Arbab and his co-workers [
 <xref rid="B196-pharmaceuticals-14-00381" ref-type="bibr">196</xref>], around 60 medicinal plants were taken into consideration against hepatitis B virus. The evaluation of the antiviral power of these plants was carried out by measuring the expression of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B virus e antigen (HBeAg). All the 60 plants selected had their potential role in treatment of liver disease and exerted their hepatoprotective and anti-retroviral action. Various extracts like dichloromethane extract of 
 <italic>G. senegalensi</italic> showed their potential role in the treatment of stomach, veneral, respiratory, microbial, dermatological and anti-HSV activity. Another extract which had its potential role in jaundice and hepatobiliary disorders is 
 <italic>F. parviflora</italic>. It exerted its role in anti-HB, jaundice and hepatoprotective action in rats. Extracts from different Acacia species have shown important antiviral activities on HIV and HBV as well as hepatoprotective action. Overall, the antiviral action against HBV is ascribed to numerous phytochemicals such as flavonoids, lignans, terpenoids, alkaloids, anthraquinones and saponins [
