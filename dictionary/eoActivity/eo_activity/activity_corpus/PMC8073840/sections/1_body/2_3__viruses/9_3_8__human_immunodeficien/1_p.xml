<p>The other virus that can have an adverse effect on humans include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and major worldwide epidemic for which vaccine is still not found. The human immunodeficiency viruses 1 and 2 (HIV-1, HIV-2) directly derived from simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) of primates, thus both having a zoonotic origin. HIV-2 has a more limited geographical spread and appears to be less pathogenic than HIV-1, while HIV-1 is responsible for worldwide HIV pandemic [
 <xref rid="B74-pharmaceuticals-14-00381" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. HIV is an RNA virus that belongs to Lentivirus genus, of the Retroviridae family [
 <xref rid="B75-pharmaceuticals-14-00381" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. This latter is a particular viral family, that of retroviruses, with an absolutely unique replication mechanism. By means of a specific enzyme, reverse transcriptase, retroviruses are able to transform their RNA gene pool into a double-stranded DNA. This goes into the DNA of the infected cell (called “host cell” or “target cell”) and from there directs the production of new viral particles [
 <xref rid="B76-pharmaceuticals-14-00381" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Retroviruses characterized various vertebrate species, capable to cause various diseases in humans and animals. Retroviruses have often been linked to various autoimmune diseases that affect the human body at different levels, inducing sometimes serious pathologies ranging from various anemias to CNS diseases and immunodeficiency syndromes [
 <xref rid="B77-pharmaceuticals-14-00381" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. The estimates of spread of this virus are truly dramatic. At the end of 2017, the number of people infected was close to 37 million [
 <xref rid="B78-pharmaceuticals-14-00381" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. However, in addition to the growing concern for considerable number of cases, what is even more worrying is high degree of correlation between AIDS and some serious forms of cancer, primarily non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma [
 <xref rid="B79-pharmaceuticals-14-00381" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. In fact, these cancerous forms are considered as the first evident stage of clinically relevant immunosuppression. In fact, in the five-year period 1991–1995 it was calculated that in the United States people infected with HIV presented 2800-fold elevated risks for KS, 10-fold for NHL and three-fold for cervical cancer respect to the general population [

The course of HIV disease typically proceeds with fever and lymphadenopathy, symptoms that disappear for 2–15 years following seroconversion. During this period, viral replication continues at a very high rate every day causing the formation of a large number of infected lymphocytes, which are replaced almost equally quickly. This rapid turnover of HIV and its enormous diversity underlie the problems in producing long-term effective antiretroviral drugs together with the development of an effective HIV vaccine [
 <xref rid="B81-pharmaceuticals-14-00381" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Available treatments that improved the lifespan of the individuals suffering from HIV comprises of antiretroviral treatment (ART). Instead, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is insufficient to eradicate the HIV, but it is mainly responsible for the suppression of viral load [
 <xref rid="B82-pharmaceuticals-14-00381" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. ART has the great merit of controlling HIV infection, but this does not mean that it permanently cures the disease. Infected people must continue taking ART indefinitely, turning HIV infection into a chronic disease. HAART was developed about 20 years ago and consisted of a useful combination of antiviral agents. This therapeutic scheme uses a number of drugs with specific inhibitory effects on HIV replication. Specifically, these antiviral agents belong to six distinct classes of drugs with different mechanisms capable of inhibiting HIV replication at different stages of the HIV life cycle [
 <xref rid="B83-pharmaceuticals-14-00381" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. The advantage of this treatment has proven to be remarkable, prolonging the survival of HIV/AIDS patients by about 7–10 years compared to the results obtained from the use of a single drug [
 <xref rid="B84-pharmaceuticals-14-00381" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Although this therapy has clearly contributed to improving the condition of infected people, recent studies showed that exposure to antiretroviral drugs may have marked side effects, regardless of HIV status [
