<p>Every year millions of people fall ill with respiratory syncitial virus (RSV) and there are more than 100,000 deaths. Although everyone can contract RSV, young and old are the hardest hit. In 2017, World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that this virus causes approximately 33 million serious respiratory infections each year, three million hospitalizations and nearly 60,000 deaths of children under the age of 5. RSV was initially originated from colony of chimpanzees that includes coryza agents. RSV not only affects children, but also adults. Regarding the annual incidence of RSV, a trend similar to influenza A has been observed in adults in fact, currently, healthy adults that get RSV present specific symptoms such as cough, rhinorrhea, and congestion [

The infection of RSV is constricted to the upper respiratory tract that involves nasopharynx with incubation period of 3â€“5 days. The hyperinflation of distal airways is mainly due to necrosis in epithelial cells that leads to intra-luminal plugs of mucous, which forms a ball valve type obstruction of airway [

The clinical manifestations involve characteristic symptoms such as fever, cough and rhinitis. Other clinical manifestations of this disease include bronchitis, pneumonia, and croup. Along with bronchitis, air trapping is observed in some cases, while two thirds of cases are accompanied by bronchiolitis and pneumonia [

Actually, it is possible to use Palivizumab as a prophylaxis against RSV in high-risk infants, but other pharmacological treatments are not available beyond this [
