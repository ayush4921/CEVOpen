<p>The term coronavirus refers to a group of large, enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses belonging to 
 <italic>Coronavirus</italic> genus. These viruses usually cause mild to moderate upper respiratory tract diseases, such as common cold but also other diseases (mainly to gastrointestinal and central nervous system) in both humans and animals [

However, in the past twenty years new coronaviruses have been responsible for three dramatic events, causing serious widespread disease and death.
