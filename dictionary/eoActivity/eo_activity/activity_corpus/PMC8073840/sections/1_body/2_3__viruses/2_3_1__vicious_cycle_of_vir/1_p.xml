<p>The virus attacks via process of adsorption that occurs on a receptor of host cell leading to its penetration followed by uncoating of viral genetic material. The uncoating proceeds and is followed by release of genetic material that further integrates with the genetic composition of the host cell, disrupting and interfering the process of transcription, translation and replication (

The virus is involved in a typical vicious cycle that includes multiple processes of replication by the host machinery, and along with this, it also includes cellular metabolic pathways that create impediments in the progression of a desired treatment that targets the virion or its process of replication. The treatment should be such that it should not lead to any adverse effects inside host cells or entire body [
