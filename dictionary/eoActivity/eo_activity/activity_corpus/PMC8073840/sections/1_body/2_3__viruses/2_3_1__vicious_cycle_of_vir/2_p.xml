<p>Viral enzymes generally play a distinct and major role in triggering and developing associated diseases. Hence, effective approaches for such treatment can be through the inhibition of these viral enzymes that ultimately leads to stopping of the viral replication. For instance, the acycloguanosine, based on the nucleosides isolated from a Caribbean sponge (
 <italic>Cryptotethya crypta</italic>) is able to provide a treatment against herpes infection. The mechanism of action interrupts the processing of viral enzymes that are responsible for the synthesis of nucleotide and its analogous. The maturation of virus may be carried out via proteinase; hence this enzyme is a good target for the inhibition via a potential mechanism [
