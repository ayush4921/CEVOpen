<p>As highlighted in the previous sections, phytochemicals extracted from plant foods could represent basis for a natural and alternative pharmacotherapy for treating several viral diseases. Therefore, it is important to consider potential delivery applications of these plant extracts. In order to formulate natural antiviral agents able to overcome the multiple biological barriers existing, thus successfully reaching their intended site(s) of action. In the last years, several promising strategies have been optimized to face the delivery of poorly soluble phytochemicals from plant foods, in order to improve their systemic bioavailability and clinical outcomes [

In particular, the most important properties to be considered are (a) log P (lipophilicity), (b) melting point, (c) phytochemical structure and (d) molecular weight. Overall, most widely used delivery systems to date are those that use phytosomal structures, elegant techniques such as self-microemulsifying drug delivery systems (SMEDDS) and self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery systems (SNEDDS), as well as microspheres, nanoparticles, hydrogels, transferosomes and ethosomes). In this sense, microencapsulation of polar or apolar bioactive compounds represents today an effective solution to overcome these problems. This technique is able to preserve and stabilize phytochemicals from physical-chemical stresses, protecting them from adverse environmental conditions and thus increasing the potential bioavailability.
