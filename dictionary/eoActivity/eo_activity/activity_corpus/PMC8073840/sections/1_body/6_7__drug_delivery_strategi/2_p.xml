<p>Furthermore, several new protected delivery systems have been developed in the preparation of functional food. These new systems can be of mechanical type such as emulsification, spray drying or centrifugal extrusion, and of the chemical type such as ionotropic gelling, liposome entrapment or cyclodextrin complexation. The application of nanotechnology represents the most innovative approach to improve bioavailability and bioactivity of diet-derived phytochemicals [

In fact, nanoparticles can help in improving solubility and stability of various phytochemical classes, bringing significant advantages in absorbing phase, as well as limiting or completely avoiding premature degradation of molecules in body and promoting an increase in circulation time. Several examples are reported in scientific literature regarding the application of nanoparticles to improve bioactivity of EGCG (from green tea), resveratrol (found in grape), curcumin (found in turmeric), and quercetin (highly represented in red onions) [

However, few information is actually available regarding absorption and metabolism of nanoparticles in the gastrointestinal tract, together with their pharmacokinetics. In general, as described in detail, the main problems encountered in use of these plant extracts at a clinical level are related to richness and complexity of their composition, and this aspect is, in turn, closely linked to the potential risk of toxicity of the extracts as well as their stability [

 <xref rid="B336-pharmaceuticals-14-00381" ref-type="bibr">336</xref>]. Considering that different encapsulation strategies can reduce toxicity further studies are extremely worthwhile to provide targeted delivery systems and to solve problems related to a poor stability. Besides, much more studies are needed to address cost-effectiveness and long-term safety of these delivery systems.
