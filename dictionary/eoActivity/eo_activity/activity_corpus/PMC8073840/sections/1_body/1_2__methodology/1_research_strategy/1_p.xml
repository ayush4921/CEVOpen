<p>In order to specifically deepen the most recent literature, papers dated from 2010 to 2020 were screened from key scientific databases (PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar). Keywords such as virus, antivirals, natural antivirals, phytochemicals, phytochemicals from plant foods, phytochemicals-based remedies, antiviral natural therapy, were searched in order to retrieve the published articles. The papers were restricted to English language. Articles were sorted out and those taken into consideration were chosen firstly by their title and then by scrutinizing their abstract. The research yielded 550 potential papers for designing this review and of which 275 were duplicated records. Moreover, 125 records were excluded for some reasons (conference paper, editorial letter and unrelated topics etc.). The full text of 150 papers were evaluated and 100 papers were included in the review.
