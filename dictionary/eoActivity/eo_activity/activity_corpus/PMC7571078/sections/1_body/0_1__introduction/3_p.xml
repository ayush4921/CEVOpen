When discussing the chemical composition and activity of thyme herb and its hydroalcoholic extracts, except for the volatile fraction, non-volatile components such as flavonoid glycosides, caffeic acid oligomers, simple phenolic acids, hydroquinone derivatives, and terpenoids should also be taken into account. Detailed information about these components can be found in the literature [
