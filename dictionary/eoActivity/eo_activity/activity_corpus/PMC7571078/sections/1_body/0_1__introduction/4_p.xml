<p>Thyme EO compounds belong to various chemical groups including monoterpenes, monoterpene alcohols, phenol derivatives, ketones, aldehydes, ethers, and esters. There are also numerous chemotypes within the 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> species, differing in the main component of EO, but only “thymol type” with thymol as the main constituent is listed in the European Pharmacopoeia. The main components of thyme EO are the isomeric phenolic monoterpenes thymol (2-isopropyl-5-methylphenol) and carvacrol (2-methyl-5-(propan-2-yl)phenol). Both these monoterpenes are biosynthesized by the hydroxylation of p-cymene after the aromatization of γ-terpinene to 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene. The scheme of the biosynthesis pathway is shown in

 <xref rid="B6-molecules-25-04125" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Thymol is a colorless, crystalline compound with characteristics including strong odor and solubility in alcohol and other organic solvents, but it is only slightly soluble in water [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-25-04125" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Carvacrol, on the other hand, is a colorless to pale yellow liquid, insoluble in water but highly soluble in ethanol, acetone, and diethyl ether and with a thymol odor [

 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, γ-terpinene, linalool, β-myrcene, terpinen-4-ol—are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04125-f002">Figure 2</xref>. Thymol after oral administration is rapidly absorbed and slowly eliminated approximately within 24 h. It is found in the form of thymol sulfate in plasma, and two phase II conjugates—thymol sulfate and thymol glucuronide—can be found in the urine. The formation of glucuronide was observed only at higher doses. Thymol metabolites are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04125-f003">Figure 3</xref>. Oral bioavailability referred to as thymol sulfate is approximately 16% and the plasma half-life is approximately 1.5 h [
