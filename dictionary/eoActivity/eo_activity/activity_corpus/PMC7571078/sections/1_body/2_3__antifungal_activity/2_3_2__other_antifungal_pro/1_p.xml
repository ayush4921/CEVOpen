<p>Ergosterol is a unique sterol found only in the cell membrane of fungi, important for their proper growth and functioning. Therefore, compounds affecting its level may have antifungal activity. The probable antifungal mechanism of thymol is based on the effect on fatty acid metabolism, including ergosterol in the fungal cell. It leads, among other effects, to an increased concentration of reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress, which causes a decrease of the extracellular polymer matrix (EPS) and capsular polysaccharide (

 <italic>Candida</italic> and also 
 <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> treated with thymol, which caused disruption of membrane integrity, membrane-associated enzyme disturbances, extensive damage and, as a consequence, cell death [

 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> EO on clinical strains of 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp. (
 <italic>A. flavus</italic>, 
 <italic>A. niger</italic>), and 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp. (
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, 
 <italic>C. glabrata</italic>, 
 <italic>C. kefyr</italic> and 
 <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic>). As a reference, amphotericin B was used. The results confirmed that this EO has strong antifungal properties against all strains in concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 10 mg/mL. Therefore, it can be an effective alternative to currently used antifungal medications such as amphotericin B, which have high toxic potential.
