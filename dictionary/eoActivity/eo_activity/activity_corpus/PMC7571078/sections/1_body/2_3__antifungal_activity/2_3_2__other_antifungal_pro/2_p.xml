<p>Caprylic acid is one of many saturated fatty acids found in lipids of plant and animal origin. Thymol or carvacrol in combination with caprylic acid has synergistic antifungal activity [
 <xref rid="B56-molecules-25-04125" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The mechanism of antifungal activity is associated with the ability of caprylic acid to be incorporated into the lipid layer, which increases the fluidity of the fungal cell membrane, disrupts its structure and function, and causes conformational changes in membrane proteins, the release of intracellular components, and cell disintegration [
 <xref rid="B57-molecules-25-04125" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In a study conducted by Bae and Rhee [
 <xref rid="B58-molecules-25-04125" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] the elimination of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> was obtained during a few minutes’ of exposure to caprylic acid (1–1.5 mM) with thymol or carvacrol (0.5–1.5 mM). This combination made it possible to reduce the dose of caprylic acid, and thus possible toxic effects. The synergism of these combinations may cause the increased passage of these phenolic monoterpenes into the cell as caprylic-acid-induced fungal membrane disruption. Thus, this kind of combination could be used in the treatment of fungal infections caused by
