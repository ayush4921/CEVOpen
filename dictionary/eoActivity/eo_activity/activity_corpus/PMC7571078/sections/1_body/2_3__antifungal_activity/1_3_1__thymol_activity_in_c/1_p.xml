<p>Cryptococcosis is a systemic mycosis caused by fungi of the genus 
 <italic>Cryptococcus</italic>, most often by the species 
 <italic>C. neoformans</italic> [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-25-04125" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In the last decade, the percentage of 
 <italic>C. gattii</italic> infections has increased, while infections with 
 <italic>C. albidus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. laurentii</italic> species are rare. [

 <xref rid="B47-molecules-25-04125" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. This disease mainly affects immunocompromised patients, especially those with AIDS [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-25-04125" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Over 223,000 cryptococcal meningitis cases occur worldwide each year, of which approximately 181,000 are fatal [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-25-04125" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. This infection is often associated with patient catheterization, artificial heart valves, or dialysis [

 <xref rid="B50-molecules-25-04125" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Treatment of such an invasive disease is problematic because of the ability of 
 <italic>C. neoformans</italic> and 
 <italic>C. laurentii</italic> to produce a polysaccharide-rich extracellular biofilm matrix. This makes cryptococcal cells resistant to standard treatments such as azole antifungal agents. Amphotericin B is effective in the treatment of 
 <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> sp. infections, but concentrations against fungal biofilms exceed maximum doses, which may lead to toxic symptoms, mainly renal impairment. Biofilm-associated fungal cells are protected against macrophage phagocytosis, which increases their resistance. Therefore, it is important to look for new active substances against 
 <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> strains. Kumari and co-workers [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-25-04125" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] investigated the antifungal activity of various components of Lamiaceae EO against 
 <italic>C. neoformans</italic> and 
 <italic>C. laurentii</italic> planktonic cells. Six active ingredients were used: thymol, carvacrol, eugenol, citral, cinnamaldehyde, and menthol. Thymol and carvacrol proved to have the best antifungal effect, which inhibited both planktonic 
 <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> species’ cells, biofilm formation, and growth. The results of this study were compared with standard therapy with amphotericin B, nystatin, and fluconazole. These drugs showed antifungal activity against planktonic 
 <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> forms in lower minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) in comparison to thymol and carvacrol. However, the biofilm-eradicating concentrations of those drugs were 32–64 times higher than the MIC for planktonic forms, while thymol and carvacrol were effective for biofilm reduction at concentrations 4–8 higher than MIC. Therefore, it was concluded that 
 <italic>C. neoformans</italic> and 
 <italic>C. laurentii</italic> biofilm was much more sensitive to thymol or carvacrol compared to standard therapies. The study also revealed that the biofilm of 
 <italic>C. laurentii</italic> was more susceptible to the active ingredients of the EO compared to 
 <italic>C. neoformans</italic>. This has been confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of thymol-treated fungal colonies. A significant reduction in the number of cells together with a deformed and perforated outer cell membrane caused by penetration of thymol into the outer layer of the cell membrane leads to the expansion of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC). This reduces membrane elasticity and disrupts the lipid layer, which causes cell death via a rapid outflow of intracellular components [
