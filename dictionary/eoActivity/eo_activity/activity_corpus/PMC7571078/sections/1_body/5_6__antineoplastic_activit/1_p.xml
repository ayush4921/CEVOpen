<p>Neoplasms (cancer) are a serious global health problem, as they are the second most common cause of death in the world, accounting for approximately 9.6 million deaths in 2018. The incidence of neoplasm is still increasing, so there is a need for new and better treatments [

 <xref rid="B73-molecules-25-04125" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Thymol exerts an anti-tumor effect through various mechanisms such as inhibition of cell growth (antiproliferative activity), induction of apoptosis, production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), depolarization of mitochondrial membrane, activation of Bax proapoptotic mitochondrial proteins, and interaction with caspase or poly-ADP ribose polymerase [
 <xref rid="B74-molecules-25-04125" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Elbe and co-workers [
 <xref rid="B75-molecules-25-04125" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] studied the antiproliferative and proapoptotic properties of thymol on non-small-cell lung carcinoma, highly metastatic breast adenocarcinoma, and prostate cancer cell lines. Thymol showed cytotoxic effects on the above-mentioned tumor types in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. A selective antiproliferative effect against cancer cells was observed. Thymol induced apoptosis of tumor cells, but the mechanism of this action has not been fully explained. It is most likely associated with hydrophobic properties of the thymol molecule and the ability to increase cancer cell plasma membrane permeability.
