 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, from the 
 <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> family, is the cause of numerous chronic hospital infections with high mortality and prolonged hospitalization due to the high virulence of this pathogen, dynamically developing antibiotic resistance, and limited treatment methods [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-25-04125" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In a study conducted by Mohamed [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-25-04125" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] on biofilm-forming 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> strains, the biofilm eradication ability from 80.1 to 98.0% thyme EO in different concentrations was demonstrated. The main component responsible for these antibacterial properties was thymol. Pure thymol (5 Âµg/mL) has also been tested and its biofilm reduction ability was confirmed. The capacity to reduce pathogen viability, however, was not demonstrated. Strong synergism in action on cell viability has been observed using thyme EO and thymol with ciprofloxacin. The use of the EO allowed the dose of the antibiotic to be lowered in both biofilm-forming and plankton cells. The study results suggest that the combination of thyme EO or thymol with this antibiotic could reduce its possible toxic effects and the cost of treatment.
