<p>Antibiotic resistance to currently used and frequently overused antibiotics is a growing problem in the pharmacotherapy of bacterial infections. Therefore, it is very important to search for new substances, including those of natural origin, that can be used to combat pathogens [

Bacterial and fungal resistance to antibiotics and disinfectants is related to their ability of biofilm production that prevents the penetration of the antibacterial agent into the site of infection. Biofilm is defined as a group of microorganisms connected by a cell-free polymer matrix composed mainly of polysaccharides, protein, and DNA. This structure shows adhesion to solid surfaces, usually internal implants, valves, or catheters. Pathogenic bacteria and fungi are protected by a thick layer of polysaccharide against harmful factors, such as immune cells, oxidative stress, and antimicrobial agents. These microorganisms are a thousand times more resistant to antimicrobials than planktonic forms. This is caused by the physiological differences of cells that make up the biofilm—their metabolic rate and oxygen and nutrient consumption are lowered. These mechanisms lead to increased tolerance to commonly used antibiotics and exacerbation of infectious processes [

This is a communication system between bacterial cells affecting the regulation of gene expression in response to the density of microbial populations. QS is of particular importance in the colonization of new territories by bacteria. It specifies the conditions to which individual microorganisms can adapt [

 <xref rid="B26-molecules-25-04125" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It is estimated that 65–80% of all infections are caused by biofilm-related microorganisms, which is the main reason for the ineffectiveness of treatment [
