<p>Thyme EO antimicrobial activity depends on the percentage composition of its main components [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-04125" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. EOs with a high phenolic monoterpene percentage, primarily thymol, have the strongest antibacterial properties connected with their structure. Small and lipophobic particles can easily overcome lipid barriers [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-04125" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Pathogens’ cell membrane, due to its hydrophobic composition, is a target for EO compounds. Studies on the mechanism of thymol’s antibacterial activity indicate that its ability to integrate into the lipid layer of the cell membrane increases the surface curvature. The hydrophilic part of the molecule interacts with the polar part of the membrane, while the hydrophobic benzene ring and aliphatic side chains sink into the inner part of the biological membrane. This causes large changes in membrane structure by destabilization of the lipid layer, elasticity decrease, and fluidity increase. This process leads to increased permeability to potassium and hydrogen ions. It also affects the activity of internal membrane proteins such as enzymes and receptors. After incorporation into the cell membrane, thymol interacts with its embedded proteins through various non-specific mechanisms, which lead to changes in the conformation and activity of internal and membrane proteins. Thus, cell membrane tension and destabilization can be induced by the presence of thymol. Carvacrol acts on the bacterial membrane in a similar way to thymol. Isolated compounds have stronger destructive effects than EO which contain them [
