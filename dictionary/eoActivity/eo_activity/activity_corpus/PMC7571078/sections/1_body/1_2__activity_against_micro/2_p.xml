<p>According to the WHO, priority bacteria that are also able to form biofilm include carbapenem-resistant

Infections caused by the above-mentioned microorganisms, due to their ability to produce virulence factors, are a serious problem of modern pharmacotherapy. Based on the Antibiotic Resistance Report of 2019, over 2.8 million infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria occur in the US every year, causing deaths of over 35,000 people [

Another challenge for modern antibiotic therapy is the high toxicity of currently used antimicrobial medications and, consequently, the severe side effects they cause. Often therapeutic doses are too cytotoxic to be used in the treatment [
