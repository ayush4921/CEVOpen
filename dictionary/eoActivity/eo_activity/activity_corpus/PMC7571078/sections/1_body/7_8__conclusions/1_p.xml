<p>Current research confirms the broad spectrum of biological and therapeutic effects of thymol and thyme EO. Antibiofilm action includes bacteria such as 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, 
 <italic>P. putida</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and (MRSA) methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Antifungal properties have been demonstrated for 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp., as well as 
 <italic>C. neoformans</italic> and 
 <italic>C. laurentii</italic>, which were distinguished by resistance to standard antifungal therapy due to their biofilm-forming ability. Activity against parasites such as 
 <italic>L. infantum</italic> has also been observed. Thyme EO and extracts show diverse antiviral activity against such viruses as influenza virus, HSV-1, HSV-2, and HIV-1. In silico studies on the anti-Sars-CoV-2 activity of thymol are also very promising. Unfortunately, the molecular mechanism of action for most of them is not well known. Further research is needed, particularly in vivo, and the therapeutic potential of thyme EO and thymol in infectious diseases should be identified. Thymol also has promising anti-tumor activity through various mechanisms, e.g., associated with the induction of apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation. New forms of medicines with thymol or thyme EO, such as nanocapsules, can be very helpful in therapeutic applications, especially when administered orally, but require further, in-depth research. These studies seem to be promising.
