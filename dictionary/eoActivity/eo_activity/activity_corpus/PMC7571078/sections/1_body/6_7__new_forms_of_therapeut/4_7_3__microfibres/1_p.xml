Incorporation of controlled-release antibacterial drugs into the dressing is beneficial for wound therapy. During studies on the advanced dressing, mesoporous silicon dioxide loaded with thymol was incorporated into electrospun polycaprolactone microfibers (PCL). Tests conducted with dressing containing 5.6% thymol were carried out using S. aureus, showing that this monoterpene prevented the initial colonization of bacteria and, if it did occur, inhibited their growth and reduced inflammation. The MIC and MBC (minimum bactericidal concentration) values of mesoporous silicon dioxide particles loaded with thymol were significantly lower than those previously found for the free form of thymol. Increased thymol activity has been attributed to slower volatility, increased chemical stability, solubility, and controlled release. Natural, semi-synthetic and synthetic polymers are widely used as carriers of active substances, including in sustained-release models. Therefore, further research and improvement of techniques for obtaining therapeutically effective microvesicles are needed [
