<p>In the research conducted by Pinna [
 <xref rid="B78-molecules-25-04125" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] on the new formulations of thyme EO, the relationship between the antimicrobial effect of the EO and the structure of carrier polymer nanovehicles was observed. 
 <italic>T. capitatus</italic> EO encapsulated in liposomes was not effective against 
 <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, as it did not inhibit the growth of the microorganisms in the tested concentration range. Glyceroliposomes and propylene glycol vesicles containing penetration enhancer (PG-PEVs) with thyme essential oil were active against 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic> (MIC &lt; 0.078 mg/mL), but had no effect on 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>. No morphological changes were noted after the application of liposomes on 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic>, while glycerosomes caused a characteristic increase in width between the cell wall and the membrane. After contact with PG-PEV vesicles, perforation of the wall and membrane appeared in pathogen cells. Encapsulation of thymol as the active ingredient of thyme EO into microspheres of natural polymers can potentially improve its delivery to the body and compensate poor absorption caused by low water solubility (hydrophobic structure). It also facilitates its oral use by masking taste and reducing irritation. In the study conducted by Rassu and co-workers [
 <xref rid="B81-molecules-25-04125" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>] microspheres based on methylcellulose and phthalate hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMCP) were used. Although encapsulation into methylcellulose microspheres changes thymol pharmacokinetics—shortening its half-life—it causes a significant increase in bioavailability compared to the free thymol form. This form may be beneficial during oral thymol administration to obtain its systemic effect. HPMCP-based microcapsules were poorly absorbed, so they could be used in the treatment of intestinal infections topically. It is important to select suitable polymers, as well as their quantitative ratio. In order to control thymol release, Zamani and co-workers [
 <xref rid="B82-molecules-25-04125" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] used mixtures of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose with ethylcellulose in various ratios. Microspheres of these polymers in a 5:1 ratio (methylcellulose: ethylcellulose) proved to be the most effective, as they enabled the largest load of vesicles with the active substance and most effectively released it at the destination.
