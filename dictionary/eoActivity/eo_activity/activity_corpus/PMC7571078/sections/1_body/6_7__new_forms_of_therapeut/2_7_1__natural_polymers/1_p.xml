<p>The research group led by Piombino [
 <xref rid="B79-molecules-25-04125" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] has shown that it is also possible to encapsulate thymol and its derivatives into microcapsules made of natural polymers. Good biocompatibility with thymol is shown by lignin derivatives, especially lignosulfonate. The synergistic effect of a polyphenolic matrix (lignin derivative) and thymol, as a phenolic active substance, is promising. In addition, lignosulfonate, like thymol, has antioxidant properties. Thymol and its synthetic derivatives were successfully placed in microvesicles with an efficiency up to 50%. A combination of thymol and lignosulfonate was used on the controlled release system and slow-release kinetics of the active compounds were found, which are due to their high lipophilicity. Chen Y. and co-workers [
 <xref rid="B80-molecules-25-04125" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] examined the antibacterial activity and possibilities of sustained thymol release from porous fibrous membrane made of cellulose acetate. Different thymol membrane loads were used and the results were compared with non-porous membranes. Slower initial release and extended total thymol release time in porous membranes were obtained. The highly developed porous membrane surface and the increase of the entire systemâ€™s hydrophobicity enabled more effective release of the substance. Thymol enclosed in porous membrane vesicles showed stronger antibacterial and growth inhibitory activity on

 <italic>v</italic>), where the survival rate of these bacteria was 0.07% for 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 0.09% for
