<p>One of the biggest challenges facing scientists from all over the world today is to find and develop effective preparations to fight Sars-CoV-2. Intensive efforts are underway to find a vaccine or a cure for the disease it causes. Already used and FDA-approved drugs with different therapeutic indications are being re-examined for their possible use against SARS-CoV-2 [

For this purpose, it uses, for example, natural compounds present in EO, which have a wide range of biological effects, including antiviral activity and molecular docking techniques. Molecular docking is a method that allows analysis of the molecular recognition of one molecule by another, and thus the prediction of the ways of binding and affinity to binding in a complex formed by two or more molecules with known structures. Protein-ligand docking is an important type of molecular docking used in modern structure-based drug design. It can be understood as an effective and economical alternative to the experimental methods of determining or predicting the ways of bonding and affinity to bond in a complex between the protein receptor and ligand. Several compounds found in EOs, including thymol, have been studied in this way. For this purpose, the recently determined crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S) was used [
 <xref rid="B65-molecules-25-04125" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The S protein consists of two units. The first is S1, also called a receptor-binding domain (RBD), which binds to the peptidase domain of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), initiating virus attachment to the host cell surface. The second unit is S2, responsible for the virus-host membrane [

The S1 subunit is of great clinical importance as inhibition of RBD may lead to conformational changes of S-protein, which is the first step to hinder viral infections. Studies have shown that carvacrol, anethole, cinnamaldehyde, L-4-terpineol, and others displayed a better binding affinity with high docking scores compared to the rest of the tested ligands. This was associated with better binding affinities of these ligands with the RBD of the S protein by H-bond and hydrophobic interactions with the amino acid residues in the binding site. Thymol, camphene, pulegone, ocimene and menthol also showed good binding affinities. However, they lacked hydrogen binding interactions with the protein. Since there are many hydrophobic residues around the ligands in the binding pocket, hydrophobic interactions between them may contribute to the stability of the complex protein-ligand [

Both the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the USA and the Government of Canada have placed on the list of disinfectants with evidence for use against COVID-19 preparations with thymol as the active ingredient. These products are designed to disinfect external hard surfaces and hands in healthcare, institutional, or residential applications [
