<p>Feriotto et al. [
 <xref rid="B70-molecules-25-04125" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] demonstrated the antiviral activity of three 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic>, 
 <italic>Cymbopogon citratus</italic> (DC.) Stapf and 
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> L. EOs against HIV-1. The resulting EOs disturbed the function of the Tat protein, which plays a key role in the HIV replication cycle and can therefore be an important target for antiviral agents. It is a transcription transactivator whose effect is to increase the affinity of the P-TEFb complex kinase for the short TAR viral RNA (trans-activating region) and, consequently, leads to an increase in extended viral transcripts and exit of the latent phase. There was a clear inhibitory potential for EOs obtained from 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> (in concentrations from 0.25 to 0.5 μg/mL), 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> (from 3 to 6 μg/mL) and 
 <italic>C. citratus</italic> (from 6 to 12 μg/mL) for binding Tat to TAR RNA. A virus transcription inhibiting effect was also observed. 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> and 
 <italic>C. citratus</italic> EOs reduced HIV-1 transcription by 52% and 60%, respectively, at 0.30 ng/mL and 0.65 ng/mL used.
