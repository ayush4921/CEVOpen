<p>Toujani et al. [
 <xref rid="B71-molecules-25-04125" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] demonstrated 
 <italic>T. capitatus</italic> activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2 herpes viruses. Ethanol extract (EE) proved to be the most active against both tested viruses. The three most active compounds from 
 <italic>T. capitatus</italic> EE were isolated: β-sitosterol, cinnamaldehyde, and carvacrol. Of these compounds, β-sitosterol showed the strongest antiviral activity. The potential mechanism of action of the extracted active compounds is mainly the direct inactivation of extracellular HSV-2 virions and, as a consequence, the reduced ability of the virus to spread between cells.
