<p>Viral diseases continue to be a significant health problem worldwide. It is noted that the relatively narrow mechanisms of action of antiviral drugs lead to the development of virusesâ€™ resistance to commonly used medicines. The mechanisms of action of essential oils (EOs) are versatile due to the complexity of composition and synergism of bioactive compounds compared to synthetic antiviral substances (e.g., acyclovir) that act in a manner specific to a particular type of virus [

The action of EOs can interfere with the extracellular level, i.e., the penetration of the virus into the host cell, interfering with the structure of the viral envelope, or block viral proteins that are necessary for the virus to enter the host cells. EOs can also have antiviral effects against intracellular viruses (

It is possible to determine at what stage of the infection EOs work, but there are no precise data on the molecular mechanism of action, including specific sites of action, and the types of interactions. It is important to learn about these mechanisms in order to be able to use the potential of EOs in viral infections [
