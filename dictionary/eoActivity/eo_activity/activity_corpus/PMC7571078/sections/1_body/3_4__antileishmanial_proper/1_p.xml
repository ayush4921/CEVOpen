<p>Parasitic infections are still a serious health problem, especially in less developed countries, where poor hygiene, overpopulation, and migration of people from neighboring countries are common problems. The development of parasites is also favored by a humid and hot tropical climate [
 <xref rid="B59-molecules-25-04125" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Leishmaniasis is caused by flagellate protozoa of the genus 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic>. According to the WHO, there are between seven hundred thousand and one million new cases of this disease annually [
 <xref rid="B60-molecules-25-04125" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Therefore, it is crucial to look for new and readily available antiparasitic agents. The parasite 
 <italic>Leishmania infantum</italic> causes visceral leishmaniasis, a vector born disease that mainly affects people from underdeveloped countries. Currently used medications are highly toxic and require long-term treatment. A study conducted by Youssefi [
 <xref rid="B61-molecules-25-04125" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] revealed the activity of thyme EO ingredients against this parasite in comparison to standard medicine Glucantime (Meglumine antimoniate). An inhibitory effect on 
 <italic>L. infantum</italic> growth after thymol and carvacrol use was demonstrated. In vivo studies have shown in groups treated with thymol not only a decrease of the presence of 
 <italic>L. infantum</italic> in the liver, but also noticeably less hepatocyte necrosis compared to other groups studied. Cytotoxicity studies have shown that thymol was a safer substance than other tested monoterpenoids. The mechanism of thymol activity, as in the case of bacteria or fungi, is probably based on its lipophilic nature, as it can easily be incorporated into cell membranes and disrupt the phospholipid bilayer. Increased permeability of the external and internal membranes leads to an outflow of cellular components and apoptosis. It also affects numerous enzymes responsible for regulatory processes in microbial cells, such as dihydrofolate reductase, necessary for the synthesis of active folic acid, and ATPase, responsible for cell membrane permeability regulation. However, the actual mechanism of action of thymol and other EO components for these parasites has not been confirmed yet. Thymol and carvacrol appear to be promising, safe, and effective alternatives to existing medicines used against 
 <italic>L. infantum</italic>.
