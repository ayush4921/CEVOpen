<p>Based on this criterion, the monoterpene (-)-fenchone (1,3,3-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1] heptane-2-one) was selected for this study. This monoterpene is made up of two enantiomers, (+)-fenchone and (-)-fenchone, obtained from fennel oil (
 <italic>Foeniculum vulgares</italic>) and thuya oil (
 <italic>Thuja occidentalis</italic> L.), respectively[
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Research shows that the (-)-fenchone isomer has antinociceptive activity[
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], antimicrobial[
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], anti-inflammatory and antioxidant[
