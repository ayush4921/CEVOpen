<p>In brief, it can be observed that (-)-fenchone presents antidiarrheal activity related to an antimotility effect. This antimotility effect involves anticholinergic mechanisms, which can be partially reversed in the presence of a muscarinic agonist. It can be blocked by α
 <sub>2</sub>- and β-adrenergic receptor antagonists, suggesting the participation of the adrenergic pathway. It can also be blocked by L-NAME and glibenclamide, indicating a possible involvement of NO and K
 <sub>ATP</sub> channels. Not related to antisecretory or pro-absorption activities. In the evaluation of antimicrobial activity, monoterpene inhibited the growth of fungal strains, being considered a product with intense antifungal activity, but without antibacterial activity. Besides, it has no synergistic or antagonistic effect in combination with the standard antifungal.
