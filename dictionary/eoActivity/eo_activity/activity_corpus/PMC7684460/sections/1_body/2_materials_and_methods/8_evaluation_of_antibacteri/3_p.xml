 <bold>Association test: </bold>The effect of the association of (-)-fenchone with amphotericin B was determined from the checkerboard method for derivation of the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) against 
 <italic>C. albicans </italic>strains ATCC-76645 and LM-05. Solutions of the tested products were used at concentrations determined from their MICs. Initially, 100 μL RPMI broth was added to the 96 well plates. Then, 50 μL of each product tested at several levels (1/8 MIC, 1/4 MIC, 1/2 MIC, MIC, MIC × 2 and MIC × 4) were added vertically (amphotericin B) and horizontally (-)-fenchone. Finally, 20 μL of the fungal suspension was added after the incubation period of the microplates at 35 ± 2 °C for 24-48 h. The fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) was calculated by summing the FICA + FICB (FICA = FIC of the test product; FICB = FIC of the standard antifungal). The FICA, in turn, is calculated using the combined MICA / MICA isolated, while FICB = combined MICB / isolated MICB. This index is interpreted as follows: Synergism (FICI ≤ 0.5), antagonism (FICI &gt; 4.0) and indifference (0.5 &lt; FICI ≤ 4).
