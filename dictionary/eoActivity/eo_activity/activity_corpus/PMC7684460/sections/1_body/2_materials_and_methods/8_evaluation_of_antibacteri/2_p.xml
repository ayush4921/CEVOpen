 <bold>Minimum fungicide concentration: </bold>After MIC, 10 μL aliquots of the supernatant from the wells in which complete fungal growth inhibition (MIC, MIC × 2, MIC × 4, and MIC × 8) was observed on the microdilution plates were added to 100 μL RPMI broth contained in new culture plates. Plates were incubated for 24-48 h at 35 ± 2 °C. Minimum fungicide concentration (MFC) was considered as the lowest concentration of the product that was able to inhibit the growth of microorganisms.
