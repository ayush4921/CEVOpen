 <bold>Evaluation of the participation of muscarinic, adrenergic, nitrergic pathway and ATP-dependent potassium channels (K
  <sub>ATP</sub>) in (-)-fenchone antimotility mechanisms in the intestinal transit model: 
 </bold>To investigate the antimotility mechanisms involved in the antidiarrheal activity fenchone were evaluated according to the model described by Santos 
 <italic>et al</italic>[
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The role of muscarinic receptors, alpha and beta-adrenergic receptors, nitric oxide (NO) and K
 <sub>ATP</sub> were evaluated. The mice were fasted for 24 h and distributed in different groups (
 <italic>n</italic> = 7 per group). Two groups received intraperitoneal NaCl solution 0.9% (10 mL/kg), the other two received pilocarpine (non-selective muscarinic receptor agonist, 1 mg/kg), yohimbine (α
 <sub>2</sub>-adrenergic presynaptic receptor antagonist, 1 mg/kg), propranolol (non-selective β-adrenergic receptor antagonist), L-NAME (NO synthase activity inhibitor, 25 mg/kg) or glibenclamide (K
 <sub>ATP</sub> channel blocker, 1 mg/kg). These drugs were dissolved in NaCl 0.9% and given intraperitoneally. After 30 min, the animals were treated orally with 5% tween 80 (control group), or fenchone 150 mg/kg (most effective dose). After 60 min, 10 mL/kg (p.o.) of the black marker (10% activated charcoal suspension in 5% arabic gum) was administered and 30 min later, the animals were euthanized for removal of the small intestine to calculate the percentage of intestinal transit.
