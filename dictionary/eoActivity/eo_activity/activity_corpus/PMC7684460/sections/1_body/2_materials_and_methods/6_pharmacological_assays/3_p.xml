 <bold>Effect of (-)-fenchone on castor oil-induced intestinal transit: </bold>The effect on intestinal transit was evaluated according to the methodology described by Stickney 
 <italic>et al</italic>[
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Male Swiss mice (
 <italic>n</italic> = 7 per group) were fasted for 24 h and orally received the vehicle (5% tween 80; 10 mL/kg), loperamide (5 mg/kg) or (-)-fenchone (37.5, 75, 150, 300 mg/kg). After 1 h the oral administration of castor oil (1 mL/100 g) was performed. After 30 min, 10 mL/kg of activated charcoal marker [activated charcoal (10%) in gum arabic (5% thickening agent)] was orally administered to the animals. After 30 min, the animals were euthanized, the intestine removed from the pylorus to the ileocecal junction and using a ruler the total length of the intestinal segment and the distance covered by the activated charcoal were measured to calculate the percentage of intestinal transit: % Intestinal transit = (distance traveled by phenol red)/total intestine length Ã— 100.
