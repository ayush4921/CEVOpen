 <bold>Effects of (-)-fenchone on castor oil-induced diarrhea: </bold>For the evaluation of (-)-fenchone antidiarrheal activity, the protocol described by Awouters

 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] was used. Male Swiss mice (
 <italic>n</italic> = 7 per group), fasting 12 h, were treated orally with vehicle (5% tween 80, 10 mL/kg), loperamide (5 mg/kg) or (-)-fenchone (37.5, 75, 150 or 300 mg/kg). After 1 h, 10 mL/kg of castor oil was administered orally. The animals were placed separately in boxes with a paper-lined floor for analysis of fecal cakes. The severity of diarrhea was observed during 4 h, analyzing the following parameters: Evacuation index (formed or solid, semi-solid or pasty and liquid), percentage of liquid stools, and percentage of diarrhea inhibition. Evacuation index: ∑ (Solid stool × 1) + (Liquid stool × 2) + (Liquid stool × 3) % ID = (Tween group average - Treated group average) / Tween group average × 100.
