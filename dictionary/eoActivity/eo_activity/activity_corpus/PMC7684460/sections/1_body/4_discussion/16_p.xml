<p>When tested in combination (-)-fenchone and amphotericin B, they did not show any synergism or antagonism effect, indicating that the combination between these two substances does not present significant interaction, that is, indifferent. The antimicrobial action of essential oils and their constituents such as terpenes is being associated with their high lipophilicity, which facilitates access to the lipid layer of the bacterial cell membrane and fungal mitochondria. It acts to increase the permeability of these structures, resulting in extravasation cellular contents and ions, leading to cell lysis[

 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. The lack of synergism may be related to the fact that (-)-fenchone and amphotericin B possibly act by the same mechanism of action, competing for the same binding site, which limits an effect potentiation.
