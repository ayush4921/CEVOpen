<p>L-NAME an inhibitor of NO synthase or glibenclamide a K
 <sub>ATP</sub> channel blocker was used as blockers of this pathway. From the results, it was observed that in the presence of the blockers the antimotility effect of fenchone was significantly reduced; thus, it can be suggested that the antimotility effect to fenchone may involve the NO-cGMP-K
 <sub>ATP</sub> pathway.
