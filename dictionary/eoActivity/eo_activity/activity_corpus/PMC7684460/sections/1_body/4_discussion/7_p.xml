<p>The presynaptic α
 <sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor antagonist yohimbine or postsynaptic β-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol were used to induce intestinal motility. It can be observed that in the presence of blockers the antimotility effect of (-)-fenchone was significantly reduced, with this, it can be inferred that the adrenergic pathway is related to the antimotility effect of fenchone.
