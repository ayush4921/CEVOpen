<p>To evaluate if (-)-fenchone influenced gastrointestinal motility, the evaluation of gastric emptying and intestinal transit protocols were assessed. The findings suggested an antimotility activity mediated by (-)-fenchone since it was efficient in decreasing gastric emptying and intestinal transit. Similar results were found for monoterpene 1.8-cineol showed a reduction in gastric emptying[
