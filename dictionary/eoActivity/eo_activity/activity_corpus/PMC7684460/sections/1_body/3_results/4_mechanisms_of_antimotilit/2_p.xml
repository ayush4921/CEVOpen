<p>(-)-Fenchone (150 mg/kg, orally), reduced the percentage of intestinal transit to 34% compared to the control group (78%). In the presence of yohimbine (α
 <sub>2</sub>-adrenergic antagonist 1 mg/kg, i.p.) or propranolol (non-selective β-adrenergic receptor antagonist, 1 mg/kg, i.p.) the inhibitory effect was significantly reduced to 98% and 88%, respectively, when compared to the group (-)-fenchone (unlocked, Figure

 <sub>ATP</sub> channel blocker, 1 mg/kg, i.p.) reversed the inhibitory effect of this monoterpene on intestinal transit to 85% and 92%, respectively, when compared to the unblocked group (-)-fenchone (Figure
