 <italic>Zataria multiflora </italic>(ZEO), 
 <italic>Syzygium aromaticum </italic>(ZEO), 
 <italic>Cinnamomum verum </italic>(CEO) EOs have been used in food preservation. 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> is an herb belonging to the Lamiaceae family; found throughout Asia; and Europe.

 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> and

 <italic>Shewanella</italic>
 <italic>putrefaciens</italic> and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> are limited; therefore, researches on the comprehensive assessment of the inhibitory effects of EOs on microflora are needed. Some researchers have evaluated the performance of EOs; however, there has been no comprehensive and comparative research on the chemical composition, anti-bacterial‎‎‎‎‎ and antioxidative ‎ properties of the tested EOs.
