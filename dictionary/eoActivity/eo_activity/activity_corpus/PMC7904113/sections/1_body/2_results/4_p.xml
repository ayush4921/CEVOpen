 <sup>
  <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
 </sup> with modifications (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The MBCs of four EOs were in the range of 0.64 - 40.96 mg mL
 <sup>-1</sup>. The ZEO showed strong antibacterial ‎ ‎‎activities at MBC ≤ 1.28 mg mL
 <sup>-1</sup>. There were no differences between the antibacterial ‎ ‎‎activity of ZEO and OEO (
 <italic>p</italic> ≥ 0.05). The most bactericidal effect of ZEO was observed against 
 <italic>E. coli </italic>O157:H7 and 
 <italic>S. putrefaciens</italic>. The lowest bactericidal efficacy of EOs was observed in CEO.
