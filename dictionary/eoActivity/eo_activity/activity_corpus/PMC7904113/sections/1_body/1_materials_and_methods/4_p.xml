 <bold>activity. </bold>Antibacterial‎‎‎‎‎ performance corresponding to the EOs was investigated against two important food-borne pathogens including 
 <italic>L. mono-cytogenes </italic>ATCC 7644; and 
 <italic>E. coli </italic>O157:H7 NCTC 12900 and SSOs including 
 <italic>S. putrefaciens</italic> NCTC 10762 and 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> NCTC 10038. The bacterial strains were prepared from the Iranian Biological Resource Center and Department of Food Hygiene, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran. Bacterial suspensions were prepared for culturing the lyophilized bacteria in 9.00 mL of brain heart infusion (BHI) broth (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis
 <italic>, </italic>USA) and incubated at a temperature of 37.00 ˚C for 24 hr. Next, bacterial culture was enriched in the Mueller Hinton broth (MHB; Merck, Darmstadt, ‎ Germany) at 37.00 ˚C for 24 hr. The antibacterial ‎‎susceptibility and EOs antibacterial ‎‎activity tests were also carried out.
