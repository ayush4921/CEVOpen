 <bold>Time-kill studies. </bold>Time-kill kinetics were determined by some remaining viable bacteria at different time points following exposure to the tested EOs. Kill time study was conducted with the MIC value obtained formerly. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) reader method was used. To determine the survival curves, sterile 96 well microplates were used with BHI. Sterile freshly prepared BHI broth (180 µL) was inserted into the wells. Twenty µL of EOs were added to the media (with 0.50% Tween 20) into the wells. To each well, 100 µL of the organism in BHI was added; thus, each well finally contained 300 µL. After every 4 hr, 10.00 µL of the mixture from each well was added to a new plate and the volume was adjusted to 200 µL with sterile distilled water and using the ELISA reader at 590 nm, the optical density was read. The experiment was repeated each 4 hr for 2 days.
