 </sup> The DPPH radical scavenging assay is an applied tool for accessing the antioxidative ‎ performance of materials due to the relatively cheap cost and speed of completion. Four EOs in DMSO (0.01 - 20.00 mg mL
 <sup>-1</sup>) were combined with 0.10 mM DPPH solution was prepared by dissolving 4.00 mg of DPPH in 100 mL of methanol. The absorbance was read at 517 nm following incubation for 30 min at ambient temperature. The reduction of the DPPH solution absorption following the addition of an anti-oxidant was measured. Butylated hydroxyl toluene (BHT) was utilized as a positive control for comparison and 90.00 μM DPPH solution was considered as a blank. The percentage of DPPH inhibition was computed by the following equation:
