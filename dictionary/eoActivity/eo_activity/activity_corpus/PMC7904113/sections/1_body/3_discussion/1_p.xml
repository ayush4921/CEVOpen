<p>This part of the study was designed to evaluate the chemical components of four EOs using GC-MS. Components in tested EOs are listed in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The composition of EOs depends on several factors including harvesting seasons and geographical sources. These can explain differences between results obtained from different researches in which variation in amounts is significant, as this chemical compound can be found in traces or makeup to 80.00% of the EO’s composition.

 </sup> The ZEO and OEO exhibited good antibacterial ‎‎properties and proved to be better due to their phenolic compounds content which also provided anti-oxidant capacity.
