 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> shows the MIC values corresponding to the EOs against tested bacterial strains. In antibacterial ‎‎assay of EOs through MIC determination, our findings were following the outcomes obtained by our findings of the disc diffusion method and four EOs showed good inhibition activity against bacteria. The best antibacterial ‎‎effects were exhibited by ZEO and OEO against bacteria; such as 
 <italic>E. coli </italic>O157:H7
 <italic>, L. monocytogenes, P. fluorescens</italic>; and
 <italic> S. putrefaciens. </italic>This finding was per the results of Seydim and Sarikus; and the results of another study have shown that OEO is successful against 
 <italic>E. coli </italic>O157:H7, which is similar to our results.

 </sup> The EOs used in this study exhibited significant antibacterial ‎‎effects and showed great inhibitory activity against 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli </italic>O157:H7, and SSOs, but greater levels of these were required to obtain bactericidal effects in food.
