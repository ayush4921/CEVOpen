<p>Ruberto and Baratta have confirmed that thymol and carvacrol molecules are indeed responsible for the anti-oxidative ‎ performance of many thymol- and carvacrol-containing EOs.

 </sup> Strong antioxidative ‎ activity was also detected in OEO and SEO
 <italic>. </italic>Increasing of EOs’ concentration results in DPPH inhibition elevation. OEO, SEO, ZEO, and CEO were able to reduce the stable DPPH radical to a 50.00% reduction. A lower IC50 value shows more anti-oxidant potential. The highest antioxidative ‎ effect and the most active radical scavenging of EOs were obtained by ZEO followed by OEO. The CEO showed a weak antioxidative ‎ effect.
