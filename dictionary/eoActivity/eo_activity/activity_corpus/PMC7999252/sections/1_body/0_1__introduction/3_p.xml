<p>Nanotechnology is a promising new area of bioengineering utilizing the unique characteristics of nanoscale particles with diameters less than 100 nm. Nanoparticles (NPs) are excellent carriers for delivery of various drugs and compounds and they have found application in a novel treatment for increasing salinity tolerance in plants [
 <xref rid="B13-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Gohari et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] showed that NP application, in addition to increasing growth and antioxidant status, enhanced production of secondary metabolites in medically important plants under salt stress. Hussein et al. [
 <xref rid="B15-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] showed that application of Se NPs improved growth and antioxidant defenses in groundnut cultivars under stress condition. As well as Morales-Espinoza et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] reported that application of Se NP increased growth and antioxidant compound (enzymatic and non-enzymatic) in tomato under salt stress. Djanaguiraman et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] stated that Se NPs had high solubility, low cytotoxicity, and excellent bioactivity in comparison with metal-based Se compounds (selenate and selenite). In this regard, application of Se NPs improved root regeneration and organogenesis in tobacco (

Metal-based nanomaterials are non-degradable and highly reactive and may have unanticipated health risks due to their persistence in the food chain. Numerous studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of the crustacean shell derivative, chitosan (Cs), as a matrix for encapsulating and sequestering bioactive compounds [
 <xref rid="B19-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Cs-NPs have been used as carriers for slow release and adsorption fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, and plant growth regulators. The use of Cs-NPs for encapsulating and delivering bioactive compounds can protect plant cells from the dangerous effects of burst release. Cs-NPs can also shield biomolecules from damage by temperature, light, and pH. Encapsulation within a Cs matrix as micro- or nanoscale carriers has great potential in agriculture [
 <xref rid="B20-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The use of Cs for coating Se NPs can prevent potentially harmful effects on plants and the consumers of plant products. To this end, our research group has successfully developed biodegradable chitosan-based nanomaterials functionalized with selenium.
