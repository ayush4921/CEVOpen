<p>Salt stress can be a severe problem for plants because it decreases growth and production. Salinity alters a plantâ€™s metabolism and physiology by reducing uptake of water and nutrients, and inhibiting growth and photosynthesis. Abdelrahman et al. [
 <xref rid="B1-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] reported that salt stress affected more than 6% of global arable land. Saline conditions cause stress from changes in osmolality, ion toxicity, and overproduction of harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS) [
