<p>Selenium (Se) is a beneficial nutrient for plants that increases growth and yield, and has antioxidant activity [
 <xref rid="B5-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Selenium is also used in fertilizers and as a fungicide [
 <xref rid="B6-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In 1957, Schwarz and Foltz proved that selenium was an essential element for living organisms [
 <xref rid="B7-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Selenium was found to increase plant growth at low concentrations but decrease it at high [
 <xref rid="B8-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Selenium is a necessary element for animals including humans and has several beneficial roles in plants. Se application improved salinity tolerance in sorrel (
 <italic>Rumex acetosa</italic> L.) seedlings by maintaining mitochondrial integrity, chloroplast ultrastructures, and increasing photosynthesis [
 <xref rid="B9-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Diao et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] stated that Se application prevented damage to photosynthesis in tomato plants under salt stress. Se has a positive effect on photosynthesis and antioxidant defense systems. Hawrylak-Nowak [
 <xref rid="B11-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] observed that exogenous Se application to cucumbers under salt stress led to enhanced growth, increased proline content and photosynthetic pigments, and improved salt tolerance. Se can also increase the concentration of secondary metabolites in plants. For example, Handa et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] showed that application of Se to 
 <italic>Brassica juncea</italic> L. increased expression of the 
 <italic>PAL</italic> gene and production of secondary metabolites.
