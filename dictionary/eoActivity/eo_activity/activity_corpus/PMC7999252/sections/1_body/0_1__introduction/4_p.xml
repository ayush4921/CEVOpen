<p>Bitter melon (
 <italic>Momordica charantia</italic> L.) belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family. It is cultivated as a medicinal plant as well as a vegetable and contains some sixty phytochemicals with activity against human diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and AIDS [
 <xref rid="B21-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. During its cultivation in various regions, bitter melon may be exposed to various stresses, one of the commonest of which is excess salt from soil or irrigation with saline water [

 <xref rid="B24-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The effects of chitosan-selenium nanoparticles (Cs–Se NPs) on salinity in plants has not been studied. Therefore, our group synthesized chitosan-selenium nanoparticles (Cs–Se NPs) for the first time and this study was performed to investigate the effects of a foliar spray of chitosan-selenium nanoparticles (Cs–Se NPs) on growth, biochemical, physiological properties, and essential oil content of 
 <italic>M. charantia</italic> grown under saline conditions.
