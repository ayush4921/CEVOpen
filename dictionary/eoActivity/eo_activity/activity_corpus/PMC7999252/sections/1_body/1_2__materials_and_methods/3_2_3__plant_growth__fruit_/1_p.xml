<p>The fresh weight (FW) of shoots and leaves was recorded at harvest, and shoot and root dry weight (DW) was measured after samples were oven dried (UFP800, Memmert, Büchenbach, Germany) at 70 °C for 72 h. Unripe fruits were collected over eighty-five days, counted, and the yield and average weight determined. RWC of leaves in treated and untreated salt-stressed plants was determined by the method of Sairam and Srivastava [
 <xref rid="B26-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Initially, fresh leaves were weighed for fresh weight (FW), then, turgid weight (TW) was measured after keeping leaf samples in DIW for 24 h. Lastly, the dry weight (DW) was determined after 24 h drying at 70 °C. RWC was determined by the formula:
 <disp-formula>% RWC = (FW − DW)/(TW − DW) × 100
