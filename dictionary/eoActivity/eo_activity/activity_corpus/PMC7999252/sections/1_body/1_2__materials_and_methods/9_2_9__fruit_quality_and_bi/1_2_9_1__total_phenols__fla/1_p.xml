 <xref rid="B37-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Total phenolic content was expressed as mg gallic acid 10g
 <sup>−1</sup> of FW. The total flavonoid content of fruit methanolic extract was determined colorimetrically as described by Zhishen et al. [
 <xref rid="B38-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] with some modifications. All values were expressed in mg of rutin g
 <sup>−1</sup> of fruit fresh weight (FW). Ascorbic acid was determined on the basis of coupling 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine with the ketonic groups of dehydroascorbic acid through the oxidation of ascorbic acid by 2,6-dichlorophenol-indophenol sodium salt dihydrate (103028 Merck, Hamburg, Germany) to form a yellow orange color in acidic conditions as described by Suntornsuk et al. [
 <xref rid="B39-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Ascorbic acid content was expressed as mg 10g
 <sup>−1</sup> of fruit fresh weight (FW). The anthocyanin content was measured spectrophotometrically as described previously Sakamoto and Suzuki [
 <xref rid="B40-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], with modifications. Fresh fruit were promptly dried in an oven at 90 °C for 1 day. Dried fruit were weighed (about 15 mg) and soaked in 1 mL of methanol containing 1% HCl and were incubated at 95 °C for 15 min. The sample was then cooled to room temperature. After the removal of the fruit, absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 533 nm, and a standard calibration curve was prepared using cyanidin-3-glucoside. Anthocyanin content was expressed as µM g
 <sup>−1</sup> of fruit fresh weight (FW). Total antioxidant activity was determined following the method described by Suja et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], preparing a 0.1 mM solution of 2.2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) in absolute ethanol. The antioxidant activity (%) was determined using the following formula:
