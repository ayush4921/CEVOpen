After one week, the germinated seeds were planted in cultivation trays containing coco peat. The trays were kept in a growth chamber at 28/22 °C (day/night) and 62–80% relative humidity under natural light. Seedlings were transferred to main pots (40 × 15 cm) containing coco peat and Perlite (2:1,

Thereafter, the plants were continuously watered with full-strength Hoagland’s supplemented with NaCl at concentrations of 0, 50, and 100 mM. Plants were sprayed with chitosan-selenium nanoparticles (Cs–Se NPs) at concentrations of 0, 10, and 20 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> applied once a week during the growth period (six times). All treatments were dispersed in Deionized water (DIW).
