<p>The hydrogen peroxide (H

 <xref rid="B32-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] method. Leaf sample (0.2 g) was crushed in an ice bath with 3 mL 0.1% TCA and centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 15 min and afterwards 500 µL resulting supernatant was mixed with 500 µL 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (PH 7.0) containing 2 M potassium iodide. The reaction mixture was placed in dark at room temperature for one hour. H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> solutions were prepared at concentrations ranging from 2 to 10 mM and standard graph was plotted. The amount of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> was measured spectrophotometry at 390 nm. H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> content was expressed as nmol g
 <sup>−1</sup> FW.
