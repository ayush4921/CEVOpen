<p>Lipid peroxidation was measured using the amount of malondialdehyde (MDA) by the Heath and Packer [
 <xref rid="B31-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] method. The samples of fresh leaf tissue (0.3 g) were ground in 20% trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min and 4 cm
 <sup>3</sup> of 20% TCA were added into 1 cm
 <sup>3</sup> of gained supernatant. The mixtures were heated for 30 min in the hot water bath (95 °C). Thereafter, immediately cooled in an ice bath. Malondialdehyde content was determined at two wavelength of 532 and 600 nm. To calculate the MDA concentration a molar absorption coefficient of 155 mM
 <sup>−1</sup> cm
 <sup>−1</sup> was used. MDA content was expressed as nmol g
 <sup>−1</sup> FW.
