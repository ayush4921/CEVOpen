<p>Chitosan (Cs) with 75–85% deacetylation and 310–375 kDa molecular weight, sodium selenite (Se), and tripolyphosphate (TPP) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Co (St Louis, MO, USA). Other chemicals used in this project were all analytical grade, and used without further purification. Deionized water (DIW) was used for this investigation. Cs–NPs were prepared according to a published method [
 <xref rid="B25-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Briefly, a Cs solution was obtained by adding 0.5 g of Cs powder to 25 mL of 1% (by wgt) acetic acid with continuous stirring for 3 h at room temperature. Separately, 0.1 g of sodium selenite was added to 15 mL of DIW and dissolved by shaking vigorously. The Se solution was then added to the Cs solution. The ratio of Cs to TPP by weight was 2.5:1, so 0.2 g of TPP was dissolved in 10 mL of DIW and slowly added to the Cs-Se solution. The coagulum of TPP–crosslinked Cs was left to stir overnight at room temperature and subsequently, washed with excess DIW to remove unreacted starting materials. Lastly, the Cs–Se NPs were lyophilized.
