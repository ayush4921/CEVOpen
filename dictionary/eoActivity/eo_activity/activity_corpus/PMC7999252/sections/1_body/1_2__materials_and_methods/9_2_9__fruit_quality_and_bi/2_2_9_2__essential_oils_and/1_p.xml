<p>The contents of essential oils (mL 100 g
 <sup>−1</sup> of FW) were measured in a Clevenger-type apparatus. Fresh fruits of 
 <italic>Momordica charantia</italic> L. were hydro-distilled four h at a distillation rate of 3.0–3.5 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup>, in five replicates. The oils were dried over sodium sulfate (anh) and held at 4–6 °C. Volatile compounds were analyzed by gas chromatography on a Varian 450 GC, 240 MS (VF-5 MS column) with injector and oven temperature at 250 °C and 200 °C, respectively. The heating ramp was programmed for 10 °C/min and injection was performed in a split ratio of 200 and a volume of 10 µL. The carrier gas flow was 1.0 mL min

 <xref rid="B42-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The quantification of components was done by relative peak areas calculation. Relative peak areas were calculated by dividing the peak area for compound by the total peak areas for the entire compounds detected and expressing this value as percent. Oleic acid, stigmasterol, cis-9-hexadecenal, cucurbitacin, pentadecyne, and gentisic acid were identified by gas chromatography. Moreover, a gradient HPLC system with ODS C18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 µm) was used. The samples were mixed with 80% (v/v) ethanol and incubated at 25 °C for 60 min to complete the extraction of compounds. The mobile phase components, methanol: water (98:2) were filtered through a 0.2 µm membrane filter before use and the flow rate was 1 mL/min. Column temperature was 27 °C. The 20-µL samples were injected with a Hamilton syringe and isocratic elution was performed [
