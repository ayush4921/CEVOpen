<p>Electrolyte leakage through cell membranes is a characteristic of salt stress in plants. Fresh bitter melon leaves were finely chopped and excess electrolytes were removed by washing three times with DIW. Samples were suspended in 10 mL of DIW at room temperature (25 °C) and shaken 24 h at 120 rpm. The primary electrical conductivity (EC1) was first measured by EC meter, and then the samples were autoclaved at 100 °C for 2 h to release all electrolytes from the tissue. Samples were cooled to room temperature (RT) and electrical conductivity (EC2) was measured. Percent electrolyte leakage was calculated as:
 <disp-formula>% EL = EC1/EC2 × 100
