<p>The morphological characteristics of Cs–Se NPs were imaged using TEM and SEM (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00684-f001">Figure 1</xref>C,D). The results showed that the nanoparticles were spherical with an average size of 50 nm. The thermal behavior of Cs and Cs–Se NPs was investigated and Cs showed a characteristic TGA pattern (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00684-f001">Figure 1</xref>E) with the initial stage corresponding to water loss at 95 °C (7.5% w/w loss) after which the Cs decomposed showing a 2-stage weight change. The carbonization inflection point was seen at the same temperature ending at 800 °C. The endothermic point at 210 °C results from water evaporation during the initial mass loss on the TGA curve. This peak and the contrasting thermograms of Cs and cross-linked Cs, are evidence that the exothermic event at 250 °C, coinciding with loss of cross-linked Cs, was linked to the bond breakage and carbonization of Cs cross-linked by TPP.
