<p>FT-IR spectrometry was used to study the composition and structural properties of the components and the nanocomposites (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00684-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). The results confirmed the structural features of chitosan: –OH and –NH
 <sub>2</sub> stretching at 3426 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, CH stretching at 2922 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and 2872 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, –NH
 <sub>2</sub> stretching at 1601 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, C–O–C stretching at 1076 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and pyranoside ring stretching vibration at 601 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. The spectrum revealed a sharp peak at 888 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> from Se-O stretching in the sodium selenite fingerprint region, matching published reports [

 <sup>+</sup> groups of Cs and TPP in the NPs. This shows that sodium selenite was efficiently incorporated into the Cs NPs. The X-ray diffraction pattern of Cs-Se NPs is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-11-00684-f001">Figure 1</xref>B. There are three prominent peaks of sodium selenite at 2θ = 24.1°, 37.7°, 53.4°, and 64.9°, which confirms a high level of crystalline structure. Cs shows one slightly broad peak at 2θ = 20.2°. After TPP crosslinking, the initial peaks remained although with lower intensity. New peaks at 18° and 24° appeared, indicating that the crystal lattice was being affected by ionic interactions. XRD peaks depend on crystal size, but the distinctive peaks of sodium selenite may overlap, perhaps because of well-dispersion of selenium into the nanocomposite matrix [
