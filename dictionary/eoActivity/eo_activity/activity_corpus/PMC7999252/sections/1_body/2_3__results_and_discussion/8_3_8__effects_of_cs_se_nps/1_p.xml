<p>High salinity significantly increased levels of total phenols and flavonoids under salt stress conditions, but foliar application of 20 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> Cs–Se NPs significantly increased the total phenol and flavonoid content even further. At salinity levels of 50 and 100 mM NaCl, 20 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> Cs–Se NPs significantly increased phenols by 9.55% and 19.71% and flavonoids by 10.25% and 25.60%, respectively (
