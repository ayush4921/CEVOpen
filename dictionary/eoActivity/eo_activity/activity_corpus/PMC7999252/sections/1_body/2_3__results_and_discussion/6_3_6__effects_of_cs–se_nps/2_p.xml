<p>Salinity causes oxidative stress, damages cellular components and can result in cell death by accumulation of high levels of ROS [
 <xref rid="B1-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In our experiments, salt stress increased H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and MDA content indicating severe oxidative stress. However, application of Cs–Se NPs significantly reduced the salt-induced H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and MDA increases. Se activates the antioxidant defense system in plants, which lowers cellular H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and MDA concentrations [

 <xref rid="B74-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] reported that Na
 <sub>2</sub>SeO
 <sub>4</sub> protected membranes by activating antioxidant enzymes that reduced lipid peroxidation. In agreement with this study, Hawrylak-Nowak [

 <xref rid="B66-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] in dill plantlets reported that Na
 <sub>2</sub>SeO
 <sub>4</sub> pretreatment reduced H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> formation under salinity stress. Moreover, Zahedi et al. [
 <xref rid="B51-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] reported that 10 and 20 mg L
