<p>In this study, severe salinity significantly reduced fruit yield and size of bitter melon. Selenium is a beneficial nutrient for plant [

 <xref rid="B18-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This may be related to the increase in phytochemical yield and fruit weight that we observed in Cs–Se NP-treated plants compared to non-treated controls. In agreement with our results, a previous study showed that application of Se NPs significantly increased the number of fruits, fruit weight, and yield in plants under salinity condition [
