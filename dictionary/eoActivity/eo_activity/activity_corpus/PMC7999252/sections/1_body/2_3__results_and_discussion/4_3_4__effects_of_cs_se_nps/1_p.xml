<p>Increased salinity leads to significantly increased Na and decreased K content in the leaves of bitter melon. Severe salinity significantly decreased K by 54.43% and increased Na by 57.72% compared to non-saline controls. Under salt stress, Cs–Se NP application significantly increased K content and decreased Na content compared to untreated plants. Cs–Se NPs also significantly increased K content in plants grown under non-saline conditions. Application of 20 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> Cs–Se NPs significantly increased K level by 8.99%, 15.96%, and 26.86% respectively, with no salt and with exposure to 50 and 100 mM NaCl (

 <sup>−1</sup> Cs–Se NPs decreased Na by 21.28% and 20.29%, respectively, under 50 and 100 mM NaCl conditions (
