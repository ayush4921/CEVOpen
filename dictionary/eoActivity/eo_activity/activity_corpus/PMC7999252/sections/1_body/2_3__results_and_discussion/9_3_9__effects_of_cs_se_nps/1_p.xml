<p>Salinity stress significantly increased essential oil content and the higher the salinity the more essential oil was produced. Foliar treatment with Cs–Se NPs under both non-saline and saline conditions also significantly increased essential oil content. In plants grown on soil with no added salt, the application of 20 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> Cs–Se NPs significantly increased essential oil content by 54.38%. With 50 and 100 mM NaCl, 10 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> Cs–Se NPs significantly increased essential oil production by 17.74% and 15.44%, respectively (
