<p>Salinity caused accumulation of MDA, promoted relative electrolyte leakage and H

 <sub>2</sub> levels. The increased MDA, relative electrolyte leakage, and H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> were closely related to the harmful effects of salt stress. Severe salinity significantly increased MDA, relative electrolyte leakage, and H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> by 59.16%, 46.74%, and 50.22%, respectively, compared to non-saline condition, but application of Cs–Se NPs significantly reduced MDA, relative electrolyte leakage and H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> content under salinity conditions. Foliar application of 20 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> Cs–Se NPs significantly reduced the MDA (by 29.47% and 18.32), H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (by 15.35% and 14.77%), and relative electrolyte leakage (by 15.15% and 10.80%), respectively, under 50 and 100 mM NaCl (
