 <sub>2</sub>SeO
 <sub>4</sub> increased CAT, APX, and SOD activity in various environmental stress conditions. In this study, when bitter melon plants were given a foliar spray with Cs–Se NPs, the CAT, POD, APX, and SOD activities were increased. Shekari et al. [
 <xref rid="B66-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] stated that Na
 <sub>2</sub>SeO
 <sub>4</sub> application improved the CAT, APX, and SOD activity of 
 <italic>Anethum graveolens</italic> under salt stress. Se increased CAT, SOD, and APX activities by upregulating expression of antioxidant defense genes in maize plants [

 <xref rid="B76-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] showed that Se application improved the translocation of zinc, manganese, and iron into the shoots in rice. Nouet et al. [
 <xref rid="B77-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] reported that zinc, iron, and manganese were important parts of antioxidant enzymes and enhanced CAT, SOD, and POD activities. Our results show that Cs–Se NPs protected plants from oxidative stress by increasing antioxidant enzyme activity. In line with our results, previous findings show that application of Se NPs increased activity of antioxidant enzymes [
