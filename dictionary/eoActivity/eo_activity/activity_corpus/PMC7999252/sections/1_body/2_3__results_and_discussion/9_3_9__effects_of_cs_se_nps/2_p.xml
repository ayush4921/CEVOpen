<p>Components identified in the oil from bitter melon fruit included: 1- charantin, 2- momordin, 3-momordicoside, 4-momordicin, 5-karaviloside, 6-cucuritan, 7-oleic acid, 8-stigmasterol, 9-cis-9-hexadecenal, 10-cucurbitacin, 11-pentadecyne, 12-gentisic acid. Charantin, momordicoside, karaviloside, gentisic acid, stigmasterol, and oleic acid are important medical compounds. Momordicoside, karaviloside, gentisic acid, oleic acid, and stigmasterol are anticancer compounds and charantin is an anti-diabetic compound. Salinities of 50 and 100 mM had different effects on essential oil composition. In 50 mM NaCl, the concentration of momordin, momordicoside, karaviloside, cucuritan, and oleic acid were increased and in 100 mM NaCl, the concentration of stigmasterol and pentadecyne increased. Salinities of 50 and 100 mM decreased charantin, momordicin, cis-9-hexadecenal, cucurbitacin, and gentisic acid relative to non-saline controls. Foliar treatment with 10 and 20 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> Cs–Se NPs significantly increased charantin, momordicin, oleic acid, and gentisic acid under non-saline conditions, while foliar treatment with 10 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> Cs–Se NPs significantly increased cucurbitacin and stigmasterol and 20 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> Cs–Se NPs significantly increased cis-9-hexadecenal. Treatment with 10 and 20 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> Cs–Se NPs at 50 and 100 mM NaCl significantly increased momordin, momordicin, oleic acid, and stigmasterol. Treatment with 20 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> Cs–Se NPs significantly increased charantin, momordicoside, cucuritan, and gentisic acid at 50 and 100 mM NaCl, karaviloside and cucuritan at 50 mM NaCl, and cis-9-hexadecenal at 100 mM NaCl compared to controls. Treatment with 10 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> Cs–Se NPs significantly increased cucurbitacin concentration at 50 and 100 mM NaCl, charantin, cis-9-hexadecenal and gentisic acid at 50 mM NaCl and momordicoside at 100 mM NaCl compared to controls. Treatment with 20 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> Cs–Se NPs resulted in the highest charantin, oleic acid, cis-9-hexadecenal and gentisic acid content with increases of 50.87%, 47.08%, 22.32%, and 32.01%, respectively, compared to non-treated plants under non-saline conditions. Application of Cs–Se NPs at 10 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> showed highest levels of momordicin (40.99%) and cucurbitacin (38.26%), respectively, compared to non-treated plants under non-saline conditions. Treatment with 20 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> Cs–Se NPs at 50 mM salinity resulted in the highest levels of momordin, momordicoside, karaviloside, and cucuritan with increases of 39.22%, 16.46%, 54.79%, and 24.48, respectively, compared to non-treated plants at 50 mM NaCl salt stress. Foliar treatment with 20 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> Cs–Se NPs at 100 mM NaCl salinity resulted in the highest stigmasterol content with a 20.20% increase compared to non-treated controls (
