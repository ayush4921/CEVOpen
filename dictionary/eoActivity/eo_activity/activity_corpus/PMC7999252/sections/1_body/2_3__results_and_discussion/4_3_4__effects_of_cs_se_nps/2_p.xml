<p>In this study, salt stress decreased K concentration, while increasing Na concentration in leaves of bitter melon. Potassium uptake is linked to sodium in roots and the excess Na from salt stress decreases K uptake [

 <xref rid="B63-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] under salt stress. Here we showed that Csâ€“Se NPs spray significantly reduced Na and increased K concentration in leaves of bitter melon. In agreement with our results, Gong et al. [
 <xref rid="B64-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] demonstrated that selenium formed a complex with Na at the root level that prevented Na from being absorbed via a decrease in apoplastic transport across the root and its translocation to the leaves. Se improved activity of plasma membrane H-ATPase, thus significantly reducing Na and increasing K uptake under salt stress conditions [

 <xref rid="B9-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], increased the K
 <sup>+</sup>/Na
 <sup>+</sup> ratio and reduced the accumulation of Na
 <sup>+</sup> ions in dill [

 <xref rid="B53-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], compared to non-treated plants under salinity stress. Jiang et al. [
 <xref rid="B67-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] reported that overexpression of the NHX
 <sub>1</sub> gene in poplar plants resulted in sequestration of Na
 <sup>+</sup> ions in the vacuoles and resistance to salt stress. Entrainment of Na
 <sup>+</sup> ions in root vacuoles maintained osmotic balance and facilitated movement of water to the upper parts of the plant. Subramanyam et al. [
 <xref rid="B68-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] reported that Na
 <sub>2</sub>SeO
 <sub>4</sub> application significantly increased OsNHX
 <sub>1</sub> transcript levels in rice under salinity stress condition.
