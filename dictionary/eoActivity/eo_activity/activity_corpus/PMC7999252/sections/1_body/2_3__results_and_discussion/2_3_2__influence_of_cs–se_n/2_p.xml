<p>Results showed that salinity significantly reduced the number and weight of fruits and the overall yield but applying a foliar spray of Cs–Se NPs to salt-stressed plants significantly increased fruit count and total weight. The highest dose of Cs–Se NPs applied (20 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup>) gave the best results. High salinity (100 mM NaCl) significantly decreased yield (78.94%), fruit weight (50.70%), and number of fruits (57.14%) compared to non-saline conditions. Under conditions of treatment with 0, 50, and 100 mM NaCl, Cs–Se NPs (20 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup>) significantly increased yield by 11.80%, 25.00%, and 25.11%, fruit weight by 5.63%, 17.30%, and 22.85%, and number of fruits by 7.90%, 13.95%, and 10.00% (
