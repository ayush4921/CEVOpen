<p>Salt stress led to a decline in the amount of Chl a and b, and total Chl and carotenoids. Severe salinity significantly decreased Chl a by 53.77%, Chl b by 56.94%, total Chl by 54.61%, and carotenoid content by 44.86%. Under non-saline and saline conditions, foliar spray with 20 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> Cs–Se NPs significantly increased Chl a by 9.88%, Chl by 8.35%, total Chl by 9.40%, and carotenoid content by 6.58% compared to control plants sprayed with NPs alone. Application of 20 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> Cs-Se NPs decreased the negative effects of salt stress and significantly improved Chl a by 20.25% and 31.38%, Chl b by 12.68% and 26.74%, total Chl by 6.82% and 30.11%, and carotenoid content by 15.54% and 16.82%, respectively, under 50 and 100 mM NaCl (
