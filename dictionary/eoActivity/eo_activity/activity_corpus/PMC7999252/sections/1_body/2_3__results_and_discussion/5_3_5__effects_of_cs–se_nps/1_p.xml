<p>Salinity significantly increased total soluble carbohydrates and free proline by 52.96% and 38.61%, respectively, compared to non-saline controls. However, application of 20 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> Cs-Se NPs resulted in a larger increase in total soluble carbohydrates by 34.75%, 34.55%, and 28.04% and free proline by 12.30%, 10.08%, and 8.86%, with no salt, 50 and 100 mM NaCl, respectively (

 <xref rid="B69-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] reported that proline acted as a molecular chaperone to maintain protein integrity. Nawaz et al. [
 <xref rid="B70-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] showed proline linkage with metal ions useful for defending against damage in stressed plants. One of the key mechanisms for plant tolerance to salinity is accumulation of osmolytes such as free proline and soluble sugars [

 <xref rid="B72-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] reported that salt stress altered assimilation, accumulation, and metabolism of nitrogen, which plays an essential role in the biosynthesis of proline. In our experiments, salinity caused an accumulation of free proline and total soluble carbohydrates, while application of Cs–Se NPs significantly increased the level of total soluble carbohydrate and proline in bitter melon plants under salt stress. The Se NPs also increased salinity tolerance by stabilizing membranes [

 <xref rid="B51-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] who reported that 10 and 20 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> Se NP foliar spray significantly increased proline and total soluble carbohydrate on strawberry plants under non-saline and salinity stress condition.
