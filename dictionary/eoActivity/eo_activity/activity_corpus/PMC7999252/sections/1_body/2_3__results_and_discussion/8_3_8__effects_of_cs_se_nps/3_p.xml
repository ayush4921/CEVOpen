<p>Different types of stress (biotic or abiotic) cause production and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are powerful oxidizing agents that are damaging to cells and can result in interruption of the electron transport chain [

 <xref rid="B78-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Non-enzymatic defenses include compounds, such as phenolic compounds and flavonoids, ascorbate (vitamin C), glutathione, carotenoids, and a-tocopherols (vitamin E) [
