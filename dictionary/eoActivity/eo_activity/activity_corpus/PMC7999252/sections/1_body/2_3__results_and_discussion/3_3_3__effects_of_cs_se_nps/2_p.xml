<p>Our results show that salinity reduced growth of bitter melon plants by decreasing the photosynthetic pigments, Chls and CARs. Saha et al. [
 <xref rid="B54-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] reported that chlorophylls were very important in plants because of their involvement in photosynthetic potential and capacity [
 <xref rid="B55-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. In this study, foliar application of Cs-Se NPs reversed the decrease in chlorophyll and carotenoid levels caused by salt stress. Increased ethylene production under saline conditions could downregulate chlorophyll biosynthesis [
 <xref rid="B56-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], activate chlorophyllase [
 <xref rid="B57-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], and cause instability of the protein–pigment complexes [
 <xref rid="B58-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Sultana et al. [
 <xref rid="B57-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] also reported lower carotenoid levels because of degradation of β-carotene and reduced formation of zeaxanthin under salt stress. Se might accelerate Chl biosynthesis by facilitating electron transport in the respiratory chain and respiration [
 <xref rid="B59-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Padmaja et al. [
 <xref rid="B60-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] reported that Se can interact with porphobilinogen deaminase and 5-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase and thereby play a role in chlorophyll biosynthesis. Application of Cs–Se NPs to bitter melon plants improved photosynthetic capacity and growth by increasing Chls and CARs under salt stress conditions. Na
 <sub>2</sub>SeO
 <sub>4</sub> application decreased chlorophyll degradation in garlic exposed to increased salinity [
 <xref rid="B53-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Moreover, Zahedi et al. [
 <xref rid="B51-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and Morales-Espinoza et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] reported that 20 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> Se NP foliar spray significantly increased Chl a, Chl b, and carotenoid on strawberry and tomato plants under non-saline and salinity stress condition. Similar to this reports, in this study Spray Cs–Se NPs increase the concentration of photosynthetic pigments in salt stress condition.
