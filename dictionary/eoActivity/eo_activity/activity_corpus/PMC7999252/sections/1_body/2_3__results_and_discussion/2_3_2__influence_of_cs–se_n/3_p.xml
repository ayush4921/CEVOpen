<p>In agreement with our results, Jiang et al. [
 <xref rid="B48-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] showed that exogenous Se application improved growth of maize plants in high salt stress conditions. The effects of Se on increasing growth and yield of plants in saline soil depended on the plant species, the application method, the salinity level and the concentration of applied Se. Mozafariyan et al. [
 <xref rid="B49-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] observed that application of 10 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> Se to tomato plants had a better effect on plants under saline conditions, while Jiang et al. [
 <xref rid="B48-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] found that 20 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> Se worked best for maize. Applications of Se at relatively low doses can increase growth and yield of plants, but higher concentrations may be toxic [
 <xref rid="B48-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In our experiments, Cs–Se NPs at 10 and 20 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> were used. Djanaguiraman et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] reported that Se NPs were less toxic and more effective than bulk Se particles because of their higher mobility, solubility, and large surface area. In addition, Hernández-Hernández et al. [
 <xref rid="B50-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] reported that chitosan itself was able to decrease salinity stress in tomato plants. Our results showed that the highest concentration of Cs–Se NPs (20 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup>) was most effective in increasing growth parameters of bitter melon plants under salt stress. In agreement with our finding, Morales-Espinoza et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] in tomato, and Zahedi et al. [
 <xref rid="B51-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] in strawberry reported that application of Se NPs (20 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup>) significant increased growth parameters under salinity condition.
