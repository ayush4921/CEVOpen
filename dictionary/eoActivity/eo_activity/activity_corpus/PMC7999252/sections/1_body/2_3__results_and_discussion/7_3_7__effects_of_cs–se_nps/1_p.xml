<p>Plants use antioxidant systems to eliminate ROS. In this study, high salt exposure significantly increased POD, SOD, APX, and CAT activity by 29.19%, 67.03%, 36.79%, and 70.58%, respectively, compared to control plants under normal conditions. As well as, exogenous 20 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> Cs–Se NPs significantly improved CAT, POD, and APX activity by 18.83%, 42.49%, and 16.84% in controls, and CAT by 14.97% and 16.50%, POD by 63.33% and 36.66%, and APX activity by 24.29% and 23.25%, respectively, after exposure to 50 and 100 mM NaCl (
