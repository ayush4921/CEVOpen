<p>Individual PCA plots were constructed for bitter melon plants subjected to 0, 50, and 100 mM NaCl salt stress and treated with 0, 10, and 20 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> Cs–Se NPs. The analysis displayed the ten best-fitting variables (plant height, root dry weight, yield, total soluble carbohydrates, proline, hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>), peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX). PCA bi-plots of treatment variable associations showed lines originating from the center indicating positive or negative correlations for different variables. Plant height, root dry weight, and yield had negative correlations and total soluble carbohydrates, proline, H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, POD, SOD, and APX had positive correlations. When bitter melon plants were grown under salinity stress, plant height, root dry weight and yield decreased and total soluble carbohydrates, proline, H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, POD, SOD, and APX increased, while, Cs-Se NPs application increased plant height, root dry weight and yield. Cs-Se NPs application to salt-stressed plants increased total soluble carbohydrates, proline, POD, APX, and SOD more than salinity stress alone. In addition, Cs–Se NPs application under salinity stress conditions decreased H

 <sub>2</sub>. Cs–Se NPs improved growth parameters, and increased yield by mobilizing osmotic regulators and antioxidant enzymes, and decreasing oxidative stress (
