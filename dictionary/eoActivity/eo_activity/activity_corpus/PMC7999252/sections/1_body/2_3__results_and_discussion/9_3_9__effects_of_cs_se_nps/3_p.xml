<p>Elevated levels of ROS and cytoplasmic Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> and upregulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) are initial responses of plants to NPs. The silver NPs are recognized by plasma membrane-bound receptors and lead to ROS production and a Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> burst in 
 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> [
 <xref rid="B86-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Application of AgNP leads to upregulated Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> levels and associated signaling pathway proteins in 
 <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> roots [
 <xref rid="B87-nanomaterials-11-00684" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. These findings show that AgNPs impede cell metabolism by binding to Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> receptors, Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> channels, and Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>/Na
 <sup>+</sup> ATPases. As sensed by calcium binding proteins (CaBPs) or other NP-specific proteins, NPs may mimic Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> or signaling molecules in the cytosol [
