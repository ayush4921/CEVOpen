<p>Growth under saline conditions significantly decreased vitamin C content in bitter melon fruit. As observed in this study, salinity decreases photosynthesis in plant. However, biosynthesis of vitamin C required carbohydrate (sugar) production in photosynthesis. Therefore, salinity reduces vitamin C. However, application of Cs–Se NPs increased vitamin C under both non-saline and saline exposure. With exposure to no salt or 50 mM NaCl, foliar treatment with 20 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> Cs–Se NPs significantly increased vitamin C levels by 28.30% and 25.71%, respectively. At a salinity of 100 mM NaCl, 10 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> Cs–Se NPs increased vitamin C levels by 18.53% (

 <sup>−1</sup> Cs–Se NPs significantly increased anthocyanin production by 48.93%, 35.21%, and 21.73%, respectively (

 <sup>−1</sup> Cs–Se NPs increased total antioxidant activity in the fruits compared to non-treated plants grown in saline soil. At salinity levels of 50 and 100 mM NaCl, treatment with 20 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> Cs–Se NPs significantly increased total antioxidant level by 16.62% and 14.43%, respectively (
