<p>Salt stress inhibits bitter melon growth in terms of shoot and root FW and DW, stem height, and RWC (
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-11-00684-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). High salinity significantly decreased shoot and root FW and DW, stem height and RWC by 62.81%, 41.28%, 55.67%, 55.57%, 69.26%, and 40.97%, respectively. Foliar application of Cs–Se NPs reversed the negative effects of salt stress on plant growth. There was also a dose response as 20 mg/L Cs–Se NPs had a larger positive effect on plant growth under saline conditions than 10 mg/L (

 <sup>−1</sup> significantly improved shoot FW by 16.97% and 24.20%, shoot DW by 7.14% and 13.35%, root FW by 13.59% and 10.29%, root DW by 13.59% and 10.41%, stem height by 7.03% and 13.47%, and RWC by 13.46% and 27.53% under 50 and 100 mM NaCl, respectively (
