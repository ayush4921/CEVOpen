<p>Nanotechnology is a relatively recent and novel field of study that has great potential for mitigation of plant stress, both biotic and abiotic. Our results showed that application of Cs–Se NPs by foliar spray increased growth and yield of bitter melon plants by increasing expression of photosynthetic pigments in the leaves and raising overall photosynthetic capacity. Application of Cs–Se NPs also enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity and reduced H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> content in leaves, thus decreasing oxidative damage under stress conditions. Cs-Se NPs increased expression of intrinsic antioxidant compounds, such as phenols and flavonoids, ascorbate and anthocyanin, and essential oil content in bitter melon fruits. This result shows a potential treatment for producing bitter melon under salt stress, since the plants will produce fruits of better quality that may be useful as dietary supplements or sources of new drugs.
