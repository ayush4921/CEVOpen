The phytochemicals of the selected medicinal plants were screened based on their ADMET properties and drug toxicity prediction, through the SWISSADME server. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacological properties of the phytochemicals, i.e. gastrointestinal (GI) absorption, blood–brain barrier (BBB) penetration, Lipinski’s rules and solubility (ESOL) were analyzed. The adopted criteria for the screening of compounds were: GI absorption = High or Moderate; Lipinski’s violations = 0; Toxicity = Zero/Nil; BBB-permeability = No and Solubility = High; (
