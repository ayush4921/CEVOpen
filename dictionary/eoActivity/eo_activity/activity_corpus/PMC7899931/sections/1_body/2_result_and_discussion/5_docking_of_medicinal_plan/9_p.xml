<p id="p0375">The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2) or spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV is responsible for the attachment of host cell and fusion of host cell membranes. Inside the S receptor-binding domain (RBD) intervenes the interaction with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2). Both RBD and S protein are extremely immunogenic and found to elicitÂ neutralizing antibodies. RBD-F26G provides a prime instance of the structural properties of this Fab Complex antibody that is triggered by the SARS-CoV immune response or any of its components. This structure suggests that the RBD level admits by F26G19 significantly overlaps with the level accepted by ACE2 and, thus, reveals that F26G19 could potentially block the interaction of the host cell of the virus by inactivating SARS-CoV. The coronavirus S protein is an important antigenic carcinogen and antibodies against S that neutralize several coronaviruse. During the initial work on SARS, the mice were vaccinated with synthetically inactive SARS-CoV, which was used to prepare a panel of clonal antibodies based on cell culture. The effectiveness test was able to prevent infection. Many of them govern in opposition to S-protein.</p>
