<p id="p0245">In this verse, onion is considered inferior to the Manna-o-Salwa of paradise food sent to Bani Israel. Due to its bad odour onion and garlic are forbidden to eat before going to the mosque or any meeting. As the bad odour create trouble for other people. Therefore, it is advised to use it after cooking. Jabir bin Abdullah narrated: The Prophet Muhammad (SAW) said
 <italic>, “Whoever eats garlic or onion should keep away from our mosque or should remain in his house”</italic>.
