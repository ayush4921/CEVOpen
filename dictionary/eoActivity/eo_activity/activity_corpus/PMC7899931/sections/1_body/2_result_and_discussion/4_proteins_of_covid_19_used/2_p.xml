<p id="p0310">All of the eight phytochemicals were docked against RDRP, 3CLPro and ACE2, the results shows that each of the comound expressed different behavior with the proteins. A threshold value of binding affinity â€“8 kcal/mol was set for the screening of the best docked phytochemicals, and best orientations for docking confirmation of ligand-receptor complexes. Docked scors were analyzed for the distinction of good or bad docked conformation (

All of our selected phytochemicals are individually screened and only the ones which shows best interaction are selected and carefully studied for the docking properties. The docking results show that these phytochemical will bond accurately with the mutant COVID-19 proteins. Especially the phytochemicals of
