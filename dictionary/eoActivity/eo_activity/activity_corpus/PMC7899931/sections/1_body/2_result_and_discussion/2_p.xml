<p id="p0085">Al-Quran is the Holy book that described the importance of plants in different Surahs. Plants are considered as the blessing of God. The Holy Quran invites human being to think about God’s creation including plants. Present research work focused on ethnobotanically important medicinal plants mentioned in the Holy Quran or used by the Prophet Muhammad (SAW) in his life as food or for the treatment of various diseases. Researches proved that these plants are an important source of nutrients, vitamins and phytochemicals effective against many diseases. Our Prophet Muhammad (SAW) said that, “Allah has not made a disease without appointing a remedy for it, with the exception of one disease, namely old age” (Sunan Abi Dawud 3855 : Book 29, Hadith 1).</p>
