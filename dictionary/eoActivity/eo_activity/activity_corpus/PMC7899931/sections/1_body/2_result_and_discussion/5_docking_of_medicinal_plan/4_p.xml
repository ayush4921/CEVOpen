<p id="p0345">The viral main proteinase is called 3CLpro, which controls the replication activities of the coronavirus. Crystal structures were determined for human-coronavirus (strain 229E) 3CLpro and porcine coronavirus (transmissible gastroenteritis virus TGEV) 3Cpro for an inhibitor complex. A homology model for SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 3CLpro was also constructed. The structures disclose a remarkable degree of conservation of the substrate-binding sites, which is further supported by recombinant SARS-CoV 3CLpro-mediated cleavage of a TGEV 3CLpro substrate. This docking result suggests that the available rhinovirus 3CLpro inhibitors may be adapted to make them useful for treating SARS (
