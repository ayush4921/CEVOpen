  <title>INTRODUCTION:</title>
  <p> Essential oils can serve as novel sources of antibiotics for multidrug-resistant bacteria.</p>

  <title>METHODS:</title>
  <p> The multidrug-resistance profile of a 
   <italic>Klebsiella aerogenes</italic> strain was assessed by PCR and sequencing. The antibacterial activity of 
   <italic>Cinnamomum cassia</italic> essential oil (CCeo) against 
   <italic>K. aerogenes</italic> was assessed by broth microdilution and time-kill methods.

  <title>RESULTS:</title>
  <p>
   <italic>K. aerogenes</italic> showed high antibiotic resistance. The genes

   <sub>KPC-2</sub>, 
   <italic>ampC</italic>, 
   <italic>bla</italic>
   <sub>CTX-M-15</sub>, 
   <italic>bla</italic>
   <sub>OXA-1</sub>, and 
   <italic>bla</italic>
   <sub>TEM</sub> were present. CCeo exhibited an inhibitory effect with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 17.57 Î¼g/mL.

  <title>CONCLUSIONS:</title>
  <p> The antibacterial activity of CCeo makes it a potential candidate for treating carbapenem- and polymyxin-resistant 
   <italic>K. aerogenes</italic> strains.
