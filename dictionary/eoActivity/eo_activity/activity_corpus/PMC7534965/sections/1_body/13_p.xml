<p>CCeo exhibited an inhibitory effect against the carbapenem- and polymyxin-resistant 
 <italic>K. aerogenes</italic> strain even at a low concentration (0.0019% v/v) and had a MIC value of 17.57 Î¼g/mL. The survival curve of the strain showed a decrease in viable cell counts over time (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). CCeo treatment decreased cell counts by approximately 5 log
 <sub>10</sub> CFU/mL. The results showed total inhibition of the carbapenem- and polymyxin-resistant 
 <italic>K. aerogenes</italic>, with cell counts reduced to zero after 24 h of CCeo treatment. Furthermore, polymyxin B showed no activity for up to 24 h. Tigecycline was used at twice the MIC value as a positive control and was found to inhibit the strain successfully within 24 h.
