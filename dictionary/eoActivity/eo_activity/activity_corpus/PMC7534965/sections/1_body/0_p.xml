<p>The emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria is an important public health issue. 
 <italic>Klebsiella aerogenes</italic>, previously known as 
 <italic>Enterobacter aerogenes</italic>, has become an important opportunistic pathogen that often causes hospital-acquired infections such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, bacteremia, and surgical site infections

 <italic>K. aerogenes</italic> strains with acquired resistance to most classes of commercially available antimicrobial agents, including carbapenems and polymyxins, is rising
