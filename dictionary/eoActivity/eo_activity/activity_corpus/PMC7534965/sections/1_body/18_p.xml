<p>Effective antimicrobial activity was observed at low concentrations, indicating that CCeo is a favorable candidate for 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies in animal models to demonstrate its clinical applicability for the future development of antimicrobial treatments. Our findings fall in line with the critical need for novel sources of antibiotics to address an increasing incidence of drug-resistant pathogens, especially multidrug-resistant bacteria. However, this study had some limitations. Studies on other multidrug-resistant bacteria and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies are necessary to better understand the mechanisms of action of CCeo.
