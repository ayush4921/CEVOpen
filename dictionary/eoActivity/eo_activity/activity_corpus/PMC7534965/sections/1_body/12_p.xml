<p>Antimicrobial resistance to carbapenems and polymyxin B was confirmed. Molecular analysis was used to identify the 
 <italic>bla</italic>
 <sub>KPC-2</sub> gene, elucidating the mechanism of carbapenem resistance. Sequencing also allowed us to identify other metallo-Î²-lactamase genes, such as 
 <italic>ampC</italic>, 
 <italic>bla</italic>
 <sub>CTX-M-15</sub>, 
 <italic>bla</italic>
 <sub>OXA-1</sub>, and 
 <italic>bla</italic>
 <sub>TEM</sub>, which provide 
 <italic>K. aerogenes</italic> with a wide range of resistance mechanisms, possibly capable of transferring related genes, leading to an increase resistance to antibiotics, thus making it very difficult to treat infections caused by this bacterial strain. Resistance to polymyxin B due to the presence of 
 <italic>mcr-1</italic> gene was not considered. However, sequencing results showed alterations in the 
 <italic>phoP</italic> gene, indicating a potential mechanism of mutational colistin resistance in this strain.
