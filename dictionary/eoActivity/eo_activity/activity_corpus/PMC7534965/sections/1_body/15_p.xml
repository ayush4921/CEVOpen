<p>CCeo demonstrated promising antibacterial properties against the carbapenem- and polymyxin-resistant 
 <italic>K. aerogenes</italic> strain, a bacterial strain resistant to almost all classes of clinical antibiotics, with a low MIC and a consistent action. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the antibacterial activity of CCeo against multidrug-resistant 
 <italic>K. aerogenes</italic>. In addition, to determine MIC values, an improved time-kill method was used, which allowed us to verify the speed of the inhibition activity of CCeo on the studied bacteria, to enhance our understanding of the underlying mechanism of action of CCeo.
