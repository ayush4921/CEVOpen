<p>The prepared burgers (70 g) were formed with a metal mold 7.45 cm in diameter and 1.5 cm deep. A plastic film was used to avoid cross-contamination between groups and to avoid deformation of the hamburgers when they were removed from the mold. The burgers were vacuum-packed in high-density polyethylene bags and stored at 4 °C for 14 days. Samples were taken at the initial time (day 0) and after 14 days of storage for analysis. Cooking of burgers was carried out by grilling in a pan to ensure 70 °C in the center of burgers in accordance with preliminary experiments.</p>
