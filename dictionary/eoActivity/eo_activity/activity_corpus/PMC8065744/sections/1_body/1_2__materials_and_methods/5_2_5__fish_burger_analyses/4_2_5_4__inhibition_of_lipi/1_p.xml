<p>For the seven treatments of burger dough with different antioxidant composition were prepared three groups of burger samples for analysis, uncooked burgers, before refrigeration storage (0 days) and after 14 days of refrigeration storage and cooked burgers after 14 days of storage. The samples were processed by taking 5 g of them mixed with 15 mL of distilled water in a Brinkman Polytron homogenizer (PT type 10/35, Westbury, NY, USA) during 30 s at 16,000 rpm. The homogenized samples were kept on ice and then were centrifuged at 1344×

 <xref rid="B31-foods-10-00776" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Briefly, 5 mL of the supernatant was added to 5 mL of 0.02 mol/L TBA, heated in a boiling water bath for 35 min and then immediately cooled to room temperature in ice. The absorbance was measured at 532 nm using the UV–Vis spectrophotometer. The TBARs value was calculated from a standard curve of malondialdehyde (MDA), which was freshly prepared by the acidification of 1,1,3,3-tetraethoxypropane (TEP). TBARs values were expressed as mg MDA/kg of burger. TBARS was calculated in cooked and uncooked samples.
