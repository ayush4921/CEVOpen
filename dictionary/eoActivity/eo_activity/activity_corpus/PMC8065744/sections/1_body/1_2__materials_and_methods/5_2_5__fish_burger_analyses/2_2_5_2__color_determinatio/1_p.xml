<p>The color surface of uncooked burgers was determined by using a colorimeter (Konica Minolta CM-2600d/2500d, Osaka, Japan) based on the CIELab parameters (

 <italic>a*</italic> and 
 <italic>b*</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B26-foods-10-00776" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Due to the color surface variation, 30 measures were performed on each burger. The values were processed by the Spectra Magic software (version 2.11, Minolta Cyberchrom Inc., Osaka, Japan).
