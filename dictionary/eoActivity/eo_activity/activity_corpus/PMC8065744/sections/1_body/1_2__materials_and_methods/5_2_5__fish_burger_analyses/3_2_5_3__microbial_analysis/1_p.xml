<p>Samples of 10 g of burger were aseptically weighed and homogenized with 90 mL of 0.1% sterile peptone water in a masticator blender (IUL Instruments, Barcelona, Spain) for 1 min at room temperature. Serial decimal dilutions were prepared for each sample in 0.1% peptone solutions (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), and 1 mL of the samples in appropriate dilutions, in duplicate, were poured and spread for total count and selective agar plates, respectively. Total viable counts of psychrotrophic microorganisms [
