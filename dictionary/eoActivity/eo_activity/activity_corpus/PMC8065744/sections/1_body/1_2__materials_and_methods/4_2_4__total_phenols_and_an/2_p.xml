<p>The scavenging capacity of samples against DPPH radical [
 <xref rid="B24-foods-10-00776" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] was assessed according to the method of Blois [
 <xref rid="B25-foods-10-00776" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], with some modifications. An aliquot (2.5 mL) of the diluted sample (1:10 in methanol) was mixed with 0.5 mL of DPPH• solution (1 mM prepared in methanol). The reaction mixture was vortexed thoroughly and left in the dark at room temperature (25 ± 1 °C) for 30 min. The decrease in the absorbance (due to the electron/proton donating activity) was measured at 517 nm using the UV–VIS spectrophotometer. The results are expressed as the concentration (g/100 mL) of essential oils or SNE, which reduces the concentration of radicals (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) by 50%.
