<p>The total phenolic contents of SNE, OEO and CLEO were determined using the Folin–Ciocalteu method [
 <xref rid="B23-foods-10-00776" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] with slight modifications as follows. Aliquots (1 mL) of each SNE, OEO or CLEO were diluted 1:10 in methanol:water (6:4

Finally, 1.3 mL of distilled water was added to the mixture and shaken gently in a vortex. After 90 min of incubation in darkness (room temperature), the absorbance was measured at 760 nm in triplicate using a UV–VIS spectrophotometer (Nicolet evolution 300, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Madrid, Spain). A calibration curve was prepared by using a standard solution of gallic acid (0–600 μg/mL), and the results of phenols were expressed as mg gallic acid equivalent per 100 mL.
