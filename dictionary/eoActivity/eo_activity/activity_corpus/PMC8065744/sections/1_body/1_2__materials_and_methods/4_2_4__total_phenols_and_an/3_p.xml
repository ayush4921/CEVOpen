<p>The ability to scavenge DPPH• (I) was calculated by the following equation:
 <disp-formula>(I) = [(A
  <sub>0</sub> − A
  <sub>1</sub>)/A
  <sub>0</sub>] 
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula> where A
 <sub>0</sub> is the absorbance of the control at 30 min, and A
 <sub>1</sub> is the absorbance of the sample after 30 min. Samples were analyzed in triplicate.
