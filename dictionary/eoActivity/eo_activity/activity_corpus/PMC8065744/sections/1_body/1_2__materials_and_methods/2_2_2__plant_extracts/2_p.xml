<p>The optimal parameters for SFE-CO
 <sub>2</sub> were defined (T = 50 °C, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 45 MPa and v = 2 L/min), and the extraction was performed from 50–60 g of elderflower powder in these conditions. The residue was collected in light glass jars and used for further extraction with ethanol by PLE. This extraction process (PLE) was performed in a Dionex ASE350 apparatus (Dionex Corp., Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The obtained residue of SFE-CO
 <sub>2</sub> (25 g) was extracted with 96% ethanol applying 2 extraction cycles at 60 °C, 5 min each. The solvent was removed at 150 ± 20 mbar pressure and 40 °C. The dark green gummy extracts were collected into dark glass vials and stored in a refrigerator until used.
