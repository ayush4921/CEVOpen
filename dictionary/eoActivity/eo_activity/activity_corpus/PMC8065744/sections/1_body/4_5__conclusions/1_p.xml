<p>In accordance with the results obtained in this study, the antimicrobial and antioxidant effects of essential oils of oregano and clove and the 
 <italic>S. nigra</italic> flower extract may be due to their high phenolic contents. These compounds have shown a protective effect against microbial growth and the oxidation of lipids in salmon burgers. Our observations indicate that there is a direct relationship between the content of the polyphenols and the inhibition of the oxidation of PUFAs in burgers during storage at 4 Â°C for 14 days. A similar decrease in the TBAR content was detected after cooking in all the samples, which indicates that the thermal effect was responsible for this diminution. The use of oregano essential oil, together with the 
 <italic>S. nigra</italic> extract, demonstrated an antioxidant capacity very similar to that achieved with a common synthetic antioxidant (i.e., BHT), with similar contents of antioxidants in the burgers (0.1%). Additionally, the antimicrobial effect of this combination of natural antioxidants in burgers was the highest after 14 days of refrigeration.
