<p>Our observations indicated that 
 <italic>S. nigra</italic> extract and OEO and CLEO are potential candidates to limit the lipid oxidation in salmon burgers. Similar findings were found with oregano extracts applied to restrain lipid oxidation in raw pork [

 <xref rid="B50-foods-10-00776" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The observed antioxidant effects in salmon burgers are mainly influenced by the use of SNE and/or OEO. The use of CLEO (S2) or OEO (S4) showed significant differences, the combined effect of SNE and OEO was significantly better than the use of SNE and CLEO. This effect is not consistent with the antioxidant activity of the essential oils studied previously in the lab analysis and the antioxidant capacity reported for the majority of compounds of CLEO (eugenol) and OEO (carvacrol) [
 <xref rid="B35-foods-10-00776" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The observed results led to thinking in some interference occur when CLEO are applied in salmon burgers, and some enhancing effect takes place for OEO. It must be highlighted that all the treatments significantly improved the results concerning the lipid oxidation inhibition in comparison to control without antioxidants (positive)
