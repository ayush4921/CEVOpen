<p>Several authors have reported different results on the decrease or increase of pH in various species of fish stored at refrigeration temperatures [

The observed results in this paper indicate that the plant bioactive products used as antioxidants stabilize the pH value in salmon burgers. Furthermore, the synthetic antioxidant (BHT) in the negative control samples had a similar behavior. The pH range of the salmon burger samples of this work is similar to that obtained in other studies conducted with salmon meat [
