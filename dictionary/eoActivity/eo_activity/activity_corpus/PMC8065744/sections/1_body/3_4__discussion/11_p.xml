<p>In the present study, the sensory evaluation was consistent with the TBAR values in the samples containing the antioxidants. The phenolic composition of the 
 <italic>S. nigra</italic> extract and the used essential oils (OEO and CLEO) were effective to minimize the lipid oxidation in salmon burgers. Therefore, these plant bioactive products could be used in salmon burgers due to the observed high antioxidant properties. Color, odor and flavor alterations are considered very important quality attributes in meat products that are largely related to the degree of PUFA oxidation in this type of food. In accordance with the assessment received by burgers kept for 14 days in refrigeration and the best results in terms of lipid oxidation (TBARS), it can be stated that 
 <italic>S. nigra</italic> extract and OEO, and their combination, can be used to retard the oxidative rancidity in salmon burgers, without altering their organoleptic properties.
