<p>In this study, the phenolic content and the antioxidant activity of CLEO and OEO essential oils and 
 <italic>S. nigra</italic> flower extract were studied before the application of these natural compositions to salmon burgers to inhibit lipid peroxidation and microbial growth. The antioxidant activity of plant essential oils is related to the capacity of polyphenols to act as metal chelators, free-radical scavengers, hydrogen donators and inhibitors of the enzymatic systems responsible for initiating the oxidation reaction. Furthermore, they can act as a substrate for free radicals like superoxide or hydroxyl or intervene in propagation reactions [
