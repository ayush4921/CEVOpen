<p>The high content of phenolic compounds in OEO and SNE (5.74% and 2.67% gallic acid equivalents respectively), as well as the possible synergism of its antioxidant qualities in general, could have led to an increase in the protection of PUFAs in salmon meat. This effect was similar to that induced by BHT, one of the most widely used chemical antioxidants for this purpose in the food industry. The antioxidant effect of elderflower extract and BHT has been compared before, and the capacity of 
 <italic>S. nigra</italic> as an antioxidant has been demonstrated [
 <xref rid="B36-foods-10-00776" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. From our results, it can be inferred that the mixture of OEO and 
 <italic>S. nigra</italic> extract could be adequate to retard the oxidation of lipids in salmon meat.
