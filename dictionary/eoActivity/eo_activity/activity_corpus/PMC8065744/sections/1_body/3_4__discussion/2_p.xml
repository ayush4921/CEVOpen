<p>The contents of phenolic compounds of the essential oils and the flower extracts studied in this work revealed that these contain many bioactive compounds, which gives them a high antioxidant capacity. Regarding phenolic compounds, 
 <italic>S. nigra</italic> has been reported as a plant material with high content of flavonoids (rutin and quercetin) and phenolic acids (gallic acid and gentisic acid) [
 <xref rid="B20-foods-10-00776" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The main compounds of CLEO and OEO were eugenol (76.9%) and carvacrol (72.2%), respectively. This fact has been reported by other authors, which found that eugenol is a remarkably better antioxidant in comparison to carvacrol [

 <xref rid="B36-foods-10-00776" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] found SNE as a better antioxidant than BHT because the elderflower extract showed a significantly greater antiradical activity concerning DPPH scavenging, although, in our results, there were no significant differences between them. Free-radical scavenging is one of the known mechanisms able to inhibit lipid oxidation. It is a rapid and widely used method to characterize the antioxidant activity of plant materials [
 <xref rid="B37-foods-10-00776" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Several studies have evaluated the relationship between the antioxidant activity of plant products and their phenolic content. Substances that can perform this reaction can be considered as antioxidants and radical scavengers [
 <xref rid="B38-foods-10-00776" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This study indicates that higher total phenol contents lead to better DPPH scavenging activity of the antioxidants studied, and this agrees with previous reports [
