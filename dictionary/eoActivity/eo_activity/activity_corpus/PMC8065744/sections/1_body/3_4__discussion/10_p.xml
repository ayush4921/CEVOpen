<p>TBARS values indicate the content of lipid oxidation byproducts, primarily aldehydes (or carbonyls) that contribute to a rancid taste in meat and fish products [
 <xref rid="B51-foods-10-00776" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In our study, the TBARS values increased in all samples during storage, mainly in the positive control samples with an increase of 0.86 mg of TBARS at the end of the storage period. However, the smallest TBAR increases corresponded to salmon burgers treated with BHT (0.33 mg) and the OEO-SNE mixture treatment (0.36 mg). These results show that the protective effect using the mixture OEO-SNE was effective to preserve PUFAs of salmon burgers, as well as the use of BHT as a synthetic antioxidant. Our findings are in accordance to Pakawatchai et al. [
 <xref rid="B45-foods-10-00776" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], who obtained a significant antioxidant effect with the use of pepper and garlic paste in minced salmon meat stored at 4 °C for 12 days. Furthermore, the combination of rosemary, ascorbic acid and alpha tocopherol has shown higher protection against rancidity in ostrich fillets than the use of individual antioxidants during storage at 4 °C for 21 days [

 <italic>S. nigra</italic> flowers with high antioxidant capacity are hydroxycinnamic acids, flavonols and flavanols. In this review is also reported that 
 <italic>S. nigra</italic> flowers, usually have higher antioxidant activity than berries and leaves, and that SNE has better antioxidant properties than synthetic antioxidants as BHT for inhibiting the lipid oxidation in foods. It is important to highlight that the pan grilling of burgers caused the loss of a significant amount of oxidation products formed during the storage period, with the loss of 0.17 mg in most of the treatments (Control (+), Control (−), S1, S2 and S3) and 0.20 and 0.18 mg for OEO and OEO + SNE, respectively. It suggests that these losses are mainly due to thermal degradation rather than the action of a particular antioxidant applied.
