<p>In accordance with microbial counts of burger samples stored under refrigeration (4 Â°C) during 14 days, the lower counts were detected in samples containing SNE (S1, S3 and S5). Nevertheless, significant differences were not generally found between the burger groups. The SNE was the natural extract that showed the highest antioxidant activity (

The content of phenolic compounds has been correlated with the antimicrobial activity in previous studies, which reported that the hydroxyl groups of polyphenols can interact with the cell membrane of bacteria and cause their destruction. Additionally, the antimicrobial activity is influenced by the different molecular structure of phenols [

In this study, a direct relationship between the total phenolic content and antimicrobial activity was found in accordance with the total phenolic content of OEO and SNE. Similar findings were observed for the antioxidant activity and antimicrobial capacity of the antioxidant compositions studied (
