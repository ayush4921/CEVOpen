Cold-water fish such as mackerel, salmon, tuna and sardines are more susceptible to rancidity because of their high PUFA contents. The use of effective natural antioxidants prevents the oxidation of fats and, therefore, improves the product preservation without modifying the organoleptic properties of the product [
