<p>Black elderberry (
 <italic>Sambucus nigra</italic>) has been studied to be used in ecological medicine for its pharmacological properties and its phenolic content [

 <xref rid="B18-foods-10-00776" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The antioxidant properties of alcoholic extracts of the leaves, fruits and flowers of 
 <italic>S. nigra</italic> have been associated with their high total flavonoid, linoleic acid and Î²-carotene contents [

 <italic>S. nigra</italic> flower extract (SNE) and their combination to improve the quality of salmon burgers by inhibiting the lipid oxidation and keeping acceptable sensory properties with an extended shelf life. The antioxidant and antimicrobial properties are assessed by comparison with the synthetic additive BHT, which is commonly used to avoid lipid oxidation in these food products.
