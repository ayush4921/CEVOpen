<p>Microbial contamination is the main cause of food spoilage, while oxidation processes are the second cause of alteration. Then, the addition of antioxidant compounds may affect these oxidations. The food industry has preferably used synthetic antioxidants such as butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and tertiary butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) because of the potential to inhibit the oxidation processes and the ability to do not modify food flavor.</p>
