<p>In accordance with the results obtained in this study, the antimicrobial effects of the studied plant essential oils (OEO and CLEO) and the 
 <italic>S. nigra</italic> extract (SNE) may be due to the antimicrobial activity of the phenolic compounds present. In this study, the combination of SNE and OEO (sample S5) showed both, the highest concentration of phenolic compounds and the best antimicrobial effect in salmon burgers after 14 days under refrigeration (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00776-f002">Figure 2</xref>). In fact, S5 samples showed good control of all the microbiological values, especially of molds and yeasts, where the greatest decrease was obtained concerning the values at 0 days, although the statistical analysis did not show significant differences between the samples. In addition, the S1 samples (SNE + CLEO) showed the lowest total viable counts of psychrotrophic microorganisms and, at the same time, a good control of coliforms, BAL and molds and yeasts.
