<p>The values of the scavenging effect of the radical DPPH are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00776-f001">Figure 1</xref>, expressed as IC
 <sub>50</sub> values. A lower IC
 <sub>50</sub> value indicates a higher antioxidant activity of samples. The best free-radical scavenging activity was obtained with BHT. OEO demonstrated a lower antioxidant activity than BHT and SNE but did not show significant differences with SNE, while CLEO showed the lowest antioxidant capacity (
