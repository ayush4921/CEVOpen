<p>The initial values of 
 <italic>L*</italic> (lightless), 
 <italic>a*</italic> (redness) and 
 <italic>b*</italic> (yellowness) were 34.29–40.39, 7.69–10.98 and 13.09–15.94, respectively (
 <xref rid="foods-10-00776-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). These values were similar to those obtained at the beginning of the experiment. The positive control sample showed higher values of 
 <italic>L*</italic> and 
 <italic>b*</italic>, and the lowest of 
 <italic>a*</italic>, although significant differences were not found compared with the other treatments (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05).
