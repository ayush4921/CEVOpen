 <p>The antioxidant capacity of oregano (OEO) and clove (CLEO) essential oils and black elderberry (
  <italic>Sambucus nigra</italic>) flower extract (SNE) were compared with butylhydroxytoluene (BHT) regarding its protection against lipid peroxidation and microbial counts in salmon burgers stored at 4 Â°C for 14 days and after cooking. The content of total phenols was 5.74% in OEO, 2.64% in CLEO and 2.67 % in the SNE. The total phenolic content and the antioxidant capacity were significantly higher (
  <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) for SNE and OEO. Both essential oils showed a similar IC
  <sub>50</sub> and inhibition percentage of lipid peroxidation to BHT. The combination of OEO and SNE reduced 29% of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), while BHT reduced 31% of TBARS generated during refrigeration storage in salmon burgers in relation to the control sample without antioxidants. Additionally, the microbial counts after 14 days of refrigeration were the lowest in burgers when the combination of OEO and SNE was used. This study concludes that OEO and SNE can be used as inhibitors of lipid oxidation in salmon products and as natural candidates to replace commonly used synthetic antioxidants and antimicrobials in these food products.
