<p id="Par20">An important observation is that pomegranate leaf extracts held the greatest number of hydrolyzable tannins, especially ellagitannins. Nevertheless, no ellagitannins were detected by the HPLC method in the other six plants, while condensed tannins were present by the spectrophotometric approach. This was possibly caused by the lack of authentic standards involving different tannins, which need to be performed in the chromatographic analysis. In practice, certain studies have reported the tannins present in sage, rosemary, peppermint, rue, parsley, and olive leaves
