<p id="Par25">To date, amount of studies have reported the close relationship not only between the phenolic contents but also between the phenolic structures and the antioxidant capacities

 </sup>. The level of antioxidant potential of plants mainly depends on the presence and hydroxyl groups of (poly)phenolic compounds. Specifically, the antioxidant ability of phenolic acids is firstly related to the number and position of phenolic hydroxyls, and secondly to the methoxy and carboxylic acid groups
 <sup>

 </sup>. Rosmarinic acid which was mainly detected in sage, rosemary, and peppermint in our work, is an ester of caffeic acid and 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl lactic acid, comprising two catechol moieties, thus having two pairs of 
 <italic>ortho</italic> hydroxyl groups grafted on two phenolic rings
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup>. Gallic and chlorogenic acid are well-known antioxidant agents, due to three and two active hydroxyl groups on the aromatic ring, respectively
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>
 </sup>. Moreover, the catechol structure in the B-ring, the 2,3-double bond conjugated to a 4-oxo functionality, and the available of both 3- and 5-hydroxyl groups of flavonoids are essential for assessing their antioxidant properties
 <sup>

 </sup>. Rutin is a rutinoside of quercetin with one of the four hydroxyl groups at position C-3 substituted with glucose and rhamnose sugar groups
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>
 </sup>. Apiin or eriocitrin is a apigenin or eriodictyol glycoside, on which the different glycoside moiety is located at position C-7 via a glycosidic linkage along with two or three residual hydroxyl groups on the phenolic rings
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>
 </sup>. Furthermore, phenylethanoids are characterized by a phenethyl alcohol (C6–C2) moiety attached to a β-glucopyranose/β-allopyranose via a glycosidic bond. Studies indicated the 
 <italic>ortho</italic>-dihydroxyphenyl groups were the most significant, and the steric hindrance, the number and the position of phenolic hydroxyls were also thought to play an important role
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>
 </sup>. Oleuropein with two hydroxyl groups is an ester of elenolic acid and hydroxytyrosol, and has a oleosidic skeleton that is common to the secoiridoid glucosides of 
 <italic>Oleaceae</italic>
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>
 </sup>. The strong correlation of antioxidant property with well-identified phenolic acids, flavonoids, and oleuropein present in sage, rosemary, peppermint, rue, parsley, and olive leaves has been individually demonstrated to explain their diverse biological functions

 </sup>. In addition, ellagic acid and tannins, defined as polyphenols, are complex chemical substances, possessing plentiful hydroxyl groups, especially 
 <italic>ortho</italic>-dihydroxyl or galloyl groups
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>
 </sup>. Bigger tannin molecules appear more galloyl and 
 <italic>ortho</italic>-dihydroxyl groups, consequently, their activities are stronger
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>
 </sup>. Ellagitannins, ellagic acid, and their metabolites have been reported to exhibit numerous beneficial effects on human health including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, prebiotic, and cardio-protective properties
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>
 </sup>. Thus they deserve to be part of a healthy diet as functional foods.
