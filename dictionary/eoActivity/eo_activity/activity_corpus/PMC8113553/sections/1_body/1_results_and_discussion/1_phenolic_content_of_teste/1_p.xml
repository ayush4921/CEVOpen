<p id="Par9">Results of colorimetric and spectrophotometric analysis of seven medicinal and food plants were showed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. In general, the total phenolic content of the selected plant species was found to be at the highest level in pomegranate leaf extracts at 199.26 mg of gallic acid equivalents per gram of plant dry weight (mg GAE g
 <sup>−1</sup> DW), followed by three 
 <italic>Lamiaceae</italic> species, including peppermint (70.06 mg GAE g
 <sup>−1</sup> DW), sage (50.89 mg GAE g
 <sup>−1</sup> DW) and rosemary (48.48 mg GAE g
 <sup>−1</sup> DW). On the contrary, parsley displayed the lowest value of total phenols (6.94 mg GAE g
 <sup>−1</sup> DW). The same trend was observed concerning the content of 
 <italic>ortho</italic>-diphenols and tannins of all investigated samples, reporting the following sequence: pomegranate &gt; peppermint &gt; sage &gt; rosemary &gt; rue &gt; olive &gt; parsley. The 
 <italic>ortho</italic>-diphenol and tannin content of the methanolic extracts ranged from 26.40 to 391.76 mg GAE g
 <sup>−1</sup> DW, and from 1.33 to 99.20 mg of epicatechin equivalents per gram of plant dry weight (mg ECE g
 <sup>−1</sup> DW), respectively. Moreover, results on total flavonoids content showed a different pattern compared to other phenolic classes, with peppermint showing maximum values at 70.14 mg of catechin equivalents per gram of plant dry weight (mg CATE g
 <sup>−1</sup> DW), following with rosemary (49.14 mg CATE g
 <sup>−1</sup>), sage (43.92 mg CATE g
 <sup>−1</sup>), and pomegranate (24.34 mg CATE g
 <sup>−1</sup>). Furthermore, the flavonoid content of olive leaf was higher than that of rue, in contrast to the trend of the other phenolic classes. Rosemary and sage had comparatively high levels of flavonoids, while the minimum values were reported for parsley.
