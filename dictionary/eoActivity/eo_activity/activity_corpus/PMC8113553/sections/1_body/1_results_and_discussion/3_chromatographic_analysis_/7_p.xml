Among more than one-hundred active ingredients of rue, rutin, as one of its major compounds, has been a topic of interest for researchers

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>
 </sup> have reported oleuropein and its derivatives as the dominant phenolics in the olive leaf, according with our results. As shown in data (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1</xref>), up to 20 phenolic compounds were identified in methanolic extract of olive leaf, more than those identified in other six plants, evidencing it as a rich source of bioactive compounds. However, the composition of olive leaf shows a remarkable variability due to location, climatic-seasonal factors, and cultivation practices, suggesting a trend to understand the factors that control the composition of olive leaves. This can be worthy for the harvesting and production of suitable extracts to be applied in human health. Kapp et al.

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>

In addition, many ellagitannins (such as punicalagins, punicafolin, castalagin, corilagin, strictinin, tercatain, brevifolin), and their galloyl and/or hexahydroxydiphenoyl (HHDP) substitutions, have been isolated from the leaf
