<p id="Par15">Importantly, several studies in vitro and in vivo have recorded the superior antioxidant capacity of pomegranate leaves by contrast with its non-edible parts, of which leaves are as effective as peels in the anti-bacterial, analgesic, acute and chronic anti-inflammatory effects

 </sup>. However, comprehensively comparative research involving in the phytochemical and antioxidant properties between pomegranate leaves and other numerous medicinal plants is still scarce; Widely practical application of pomegranate leaf hasn’t come into being, although different biological activities of this material extracts are studied increasingly. Many authors have deeply reviewed for sage, rosemary, peppermint, rue, parsley, and olive leaf. Thus it is worth stressing on the brilliant phenolics and antioxidant property of pomegranate leaves, and developing high added-value products from these materials in the food, pharmaceutical, or even nutraceutical and cosmeceutical industries.
