<p id="Par16">With the development of chromatographic techniques, the phenolic chemistry of many plants has been explored and analyzed to a certain degree, providing us important reference data. To obtain a more complete picture of the quality and quantity of phenolic constituents in the selected plants, 64 phenolic compounds were identified (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), of which 59 were quantified with authentic standards relying on RP-HPLC-DAD, as well as by comparison with the literature (retention time, UV/Visible λ
 <sub>max</sub>, and spectra). Concentrations of identified phenolics were expressed as milligram per gram dry weight of plant (mg g
 <sup>−1</sup>).
