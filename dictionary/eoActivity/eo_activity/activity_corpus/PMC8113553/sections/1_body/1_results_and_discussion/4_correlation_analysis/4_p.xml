 </sup>. This difference may be induced by varieties, phenology, and growing conditions. In our study, the potent antioxidant capacity of pomegranate leaves was highly correlated with the content of tannins, which can be considered as the key antioxidant contributors of this plant material. However, the chemical structures of the tentatively identified ellagitannins were not determined, and studies on these constituents are also incomplete. Therefore, it is important to note although this is a preliminary study to provide a baseline of data for future investigations, a major limitation is that identified phyto-constituents were neither isolated, nor separately analyzed for their bioactivities. Moreover, the association between these compounds and antioxidant effect of pomegranate leaf is yet to be well understood. In this regard, it is necessary to further characterize the structure of these less-exploited phenolics (tannins) and their associated biological properties within pomegranate leaf. Hence, the results presented in our study confirm pomegranate leaf as a promising natural alternative in the development of antioxidant products, thereby assisting in the prevention and treatment of some diseases.
