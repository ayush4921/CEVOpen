<p id="Par13">The in vitro antioxidant activity assays were carried out to assess the capacity of plant extracts to scavenge free radicals including 2,2′‐azino‐bis(3‐ethylbenzothiazoline‐6‐sulfonic acid radical cation (ABTS
 <sup>+·</sup>) and 2,2‐di(4‐tert‐octylphenyl)‐1‐picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH·), as well as the ability to reduce ferric (III) iron to ferrous (II) iron. Overall, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> revealed that all the species displayed high antioxidant capacities, although significant differences were observed (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), ranging from 0.01 to 2.14 mM Trolox per gram of plant dry weight (mM Trolox g
 <sup>−1</sup>) for ABTS, from 0.01 to 2.27 mM Trolox g
 <sup>−1</sup> for DPPH, and from 0.01 to 2.33 mM Trolox g
 <sup>−1</sup> for FRAP (ferric reducing antioxidant power), with large variation over 210-fold. It was found that pomegranate always exhibited the highest antioxidant properties (2.14–2.33 mM Trolox g
 <sup>−1</sup>) throughout the three measurements, followed by peppermint (0.35–0.50 mM Trolox g
 <sup>−1</sup>), sage (0.27–0.40 mM Trolox g
 <sup>−1</sup>), rosemary (0.27–0.42 mM Trolox g
 <sup>−1</sup>), rue (0.10–0.16 mM Trolox g
 <sup>−1</sup>), and olive leaf (0.11–0.15 mM Trolox g
 <sup>−1</sup>). No significant difference was observed between sage and rosemary, and between rue and olive leaf. However, parsley extracts reported the lowest antioxidant potential (0.01 mM Trolox g
 <sup>−1</sup>).
