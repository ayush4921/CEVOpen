<p id="Par24">There is a highly correlation between the phenolic composition and antioxidant properties of plants. High anti-radical activity of rosemary leaf in summer was strongly related to high amounts of total phenols, total flavonoids, condensed tannins, and carnosic acid

 </sup>. It is suggested that intraperitoneal of hydroalcoholic extract of rue increased serum and brain antioxidant capacity, due to their potent antioxidant activities of total phenolic and flavonoids content, especially rutin, caffeic acid, and apigenin

 </sup>. The strong reducing power, free radical scavenging capacity, and the inhibition of hydro-peroxide radicals activity of sage leaves can be linked to the high quantity of phenolic acids, especially rosmarinic acid, and certain flavonoids like catechins and flavanols

 </sup> revealed considerable antioxidant and cytotoxic properties of olive leaf against several human cancers, largely concerned in the existence of phenolic acids, flavonoids, oleuropein, fatty acids, and volatile oils. The high concentration of phenolic components in pomegranate leaf extracts such as tannins, flavonoids, phyto-steroids, terpenoids, and saponins can be responsible for its high antioxidant activity in vitro and in vivo
