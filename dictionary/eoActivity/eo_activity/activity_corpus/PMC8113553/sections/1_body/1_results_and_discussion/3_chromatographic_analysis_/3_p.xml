<p id="Par18">On the other hand, results from Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1</xref> also showed that the most abundant phenolic classes in the tested samples were phenolic acids, flavonoids, tannins, and phenylethanoids. A considerable variation of phenolics was found, ranging, for instance, from 0.03 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup> of 2,3-hydrocybenzoic acid to 56.06 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup> of ellagitannin I. For each identified compound, significant differences were observed (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), such as gallocatechin. The most widespread phenolic acids present in the studied samples included hydroxybenzoic acids (gallic acid and its derivative, vanillic acid), hydroxycinnamic acids (caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and neochlorogenic acid), and their ester derivatives (e.g. rosmarinic acid). Significantly high contents of chlorogenic acid (1.54 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup>) and neochlorogenic acid (1.96 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup>), and the presence of coumaric acid were perceptible in rue extracts. Ellagic acid and its derivatives were abundant in pomegranate leaves. Except in sage and rosemary, rosmarinic acid was also found in peppermint (0.23 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup>), but its concentration was lower than that in literature
