 </sup> have evidenced considerably high level of phenolics in pomegranate leaf extracts, up to 328 mg GAE g
 <sup>−1</sup> DW. Interestingly, pomegranate leaves are characterized by carbohydrates, reducing sugars, sterols, saponins, flavonoids, ellagitannins, piperidine alkaloids, flavones, glycosidic compounds, which are the richest source of phytochemicals when considering the non-edible parts of this species, some food products (red wine, green tea, etc.), and another 109 medicinal plants
