<p id="Par23">In order to better understand the relationship between the antioxidant activity (by ABTS, DPPH, FRAP assays) and the phenolic composition (total phenols, 
 <italic>ortho</italic>-diphenols, flavonoids, tannins) of the studied plants, correlation coefficients (
 <italic>r</italic>) were determined (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Strong relationships were characterized between antioxidant capacities with total phenols and 
 <italic>ortho</italic>-diphenols (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a,b), indicating that phenolic compounds contribute to the inhibition of oxidative processes. The content of tannins was well correlated with antioxidant potential (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d). No correlation of antioxidant activities was found with flavonoid content (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). However, a better relationship of flavonoids (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e) or tannins (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>f) can be obtained with the antioxidant activity if excluding pomegranate or peppermint from the data, respectively. The above analysis demonstrated that the antioxidant potential from different plants was dependent on both the concentrations and the structures of phenolic compounds, in line with Cai et al.

 <italic>ortho</italic>-diphenols and tannins, which was also mentioned by Li et al.
