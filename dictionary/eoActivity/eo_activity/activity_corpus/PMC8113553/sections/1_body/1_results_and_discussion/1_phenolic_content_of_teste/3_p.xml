<p id="Par11">As shown in data (Table

 <italic>ortho</italic>-diphenols, flavonoids and tannins in the seven plant extracts, indicating that each phenolic classes exhibited considerably different content among the studied plants. This result was in agreement with other authors

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>
 </sup> observed a wide variance of phenolics in different samples of the same species, such as the total phenolic content of nine independent samples of peppermint was from 18.3 to 284.3 mg GAE g
 <sup>−1</sup>. Moreover, contents of total phenolics, flavonoids, and condensed tannins of 13 different provenances of rosemary, collected in different seasons ranged from 22.46 to 44.57 mg GAE g
 <sup>−1</sup> DW, from 1.49 to 5.01 mg quercetin g

 <sup>−1</sup> DW, respectively

 </sup>. Our results showed inconsistency with this observation, probably attributed to the varieties, or geographical differences, as well as to the collection time, agroclimatic conditions and other relevant factors

 </sup>. However, to some extent, pomegranate leaf was supposed to have a relatively higher phenolic content than many other medicinal plants. Therefore, it can be inferred that pomegranate leaf could be an important valuable source of bioactive compounds for medicinal purposes and health care.
