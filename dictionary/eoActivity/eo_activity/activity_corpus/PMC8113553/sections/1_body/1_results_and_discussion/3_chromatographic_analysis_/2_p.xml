<p id="Par17">As shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1</xref>, phenolic profile of diverse plants was significantly different. Leaf extracts of both sage and rosemary were characterized by a high proportion of rosmarinic acid (4.61 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup> or 4.31 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively). Rue presented the highest content of rutin (26.10 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup>), followed by epicatechin gallate (7.82 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup>). The major phenolic components in olive leaves were oleuropein and its derivatives. Flavanones, especially eriodictyol glycosides, following rutin were found as predominant in the leaf and stem extracts of peppermint. Parsley was described in high amount of apigenin-7-
 <italic>O</italic>-apiosylglucoside also called apiin (4.04 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup>) and epicatechin (3.72 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup>) in its leaf and stem extracts. The principal phenolic constituents in pomegranate leaves were hydrolyzable tannins, particularly ellagitannin I (56.06 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup>) and ellagitannin II (45.16 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup>), ranking the highest concentrations among all identified compounds.
