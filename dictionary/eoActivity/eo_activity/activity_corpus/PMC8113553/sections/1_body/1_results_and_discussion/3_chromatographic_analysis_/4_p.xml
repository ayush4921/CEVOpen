<p id="Par19">Besides flavanols including gallocatechin, catechin and epicatechin gallate, then various flavones (luteolin and apigenin) and flavonols (quercetin and diosmetin), mainly in the forms of their derivatives were widely distributed in the most of the studied species. Among them, the highest content of gallocatechin (2.10 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup>), catechin (3.61 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup>) and epicatechin gallate (7.82 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup>) was detected in parsley, rosemary, and rue, respectively. Epicatechin was only found in parsley with a good quantity (3.72 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup>). Furthermore, the main flavonoids from our data present in sage, rosemary, rue, peppermint, and parsley were apigenin glycosides, luteolin glycosides, quercetin glycosides, flavanone glycosides, and apigenin glycosides, respectively. In addition, peppermint also had comparative amounts of luteolin and quercetin glycosides. Likewise, pomegranate leaves possessed several apigenin and luteolin glycosides. Particularly, rutin presented the highest proportion (26.10 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup>) in rue, followed by peppermint (9.90 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup>), while the lowest (0.86 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup>) in olive leaf.
