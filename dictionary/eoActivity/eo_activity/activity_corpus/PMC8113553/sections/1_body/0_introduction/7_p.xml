 </sup>. Therefore, in an attempt to explore plant-based alternative solutions in promoting health, as well as paving the way towards our future pre-clinical and clinical studies, we aimed to analyze the phenolic classes (total phenols, 
 <italic>ortho</italic>-diphenols, flavonoids, and tannins) and antioxidant activities of different plant species under the same evaluation condition. Furthermore, the principal phenolic constituents were chromatographically characterized to investigate the relationship between the phenolic content and antioxidant activity.
