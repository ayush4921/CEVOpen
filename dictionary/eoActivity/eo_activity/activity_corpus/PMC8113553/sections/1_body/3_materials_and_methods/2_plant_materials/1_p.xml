<p id="Par30">From about one-hundred common medicinal and food plants reported in literature references, we have selected seven medicinal and food plants (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1</xref>) in this study according to following criteria: (1) higher phenolic content and antioxidant capacity, (2) lower or inexistent toxicity. Plant species were botanically authenticated by Prof. António Crespí (Department of Biology and Environment, University of Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro, UTAD, Portugal) and Dr. João Rocha (Chemistry Centre-Vila Real, UTAD, Portugal). Samples of each species were hand-picked randomly from a pool of individual specimens (n &gt; 10) that are naturally growing in the Botanical Garden of UTAD (Vila Real, Portugal), which belongs to the international network of botanical gardens. Sage, rosemary, rue, peppermint, and parsley are present in the Aromatic and Medicinal Plants collection; olive is present in the Mediterranean Calcareous collection; pomegranate is present in the Garden Fruits collection (more detailed information of each plant species can be checked at

Thus, a mixture sample for each species was obtained and used for the subsequent analysis. The collected samples were immediately dried at 40 ℃ (Drying Cabinet, LEEC, Nottingham, UK) for 72 h, before being ground into a fine powder with a blender (MB 800, KINEMATICA AG, Malters, Switzerland), and hermetically stored in the dark, at room temperature (RT) until analysis. Experimental research and field studies on plants (either cultivated or wild), including the collection of plant material have complied with relevant institutional, national, and international guidelines and legislation.
