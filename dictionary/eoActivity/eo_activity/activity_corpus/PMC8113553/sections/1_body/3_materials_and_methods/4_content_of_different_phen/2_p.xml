<p id="Par33">For the determination of total phenol content, 20 μL of diluted sample, 100 μL of diluted Folin-Ciocalteu reagent (90%, v/v), and 80 μL aqueous sodium carbonate (7.5%, w/v) were mixed in sequence. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 42 ℃ in the dark and measured at 750 nm, using gallic acid as standard. Results were expressed in milligrams of gallic acid equivalents per gram of plant dry weight (mg GAE g
 <sup>−1</sup> DW).
