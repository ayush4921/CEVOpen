<p id="Par39">The ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> radicals were produced by mixing 5 mL of ABTS stock solution (7.0 mM) with 88 μL of potassium persulfate (148 mM), and diluted to a working solution with sodium acetate buffer (20 mM, pH 4.5), showing an absorbance of 0.70 ± 0.02 at 734 nm. Subsequently, 188 μL of ABTS working solution and 12 μL of sample dilutions (water used as blank) were mixed and reacted for 30 min at RT, and then the absorbance was read at 734 nm.
