<p id="Par44">All the measurements of phenolic phytochemicals and antioxidant activity of the plant extracts were conducted in triplicate. The results of phenolic content and antioxidant activity are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Concentrations of individual identified phenolic compounds are presented as mean (n = 3) with the determination of the Least Significant Difference (LSD) for a
