<p id="Par35">For the quantification of total flavonoids content, 24 μL of diluted extract and 28 μL of sodium nitrite (5%, w/v) were mixed. After 5 min at RT, 28 μL of a 10% (w/v) aluminum chloride solution was added in the mixture and reacted for 6 min. Afterwards, 120 μL of sodium hydroxide (1 M) was added and the final mixture was read at 520 nm after agitation for 30 s in a microplate reader. The results were expressed in milligrams of catechin equivalents per gram of plant dry weight (mg CATE g
 <sup>−1</sup> DW).
