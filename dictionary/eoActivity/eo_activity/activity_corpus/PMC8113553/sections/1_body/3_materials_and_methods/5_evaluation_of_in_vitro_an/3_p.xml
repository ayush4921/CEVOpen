<p id="Par40">The DPPH radicals (8.87 mM) were formed with methanol (99.9%) and diluted in a working solution with hydro-methanol (70%, v/v), achieving an absorbance of 1000 at 520 nm. A mixture of 190 μL of DPPH working solution and 10 μL of sample dilutions (70% hydro-methanol used as blank) was incubated for 15 min at RT, reading the absorbance at 520 nm.</p>
