<p id="Par31">The sample powder of each species was weighed and extracted in triplicate with 40 mg of dry weight (DW). The extraction was performed by agitating (30 min, 200 rpm, RT) the mixture of the powder and 1.5 mL of a hydro-methanolic solution (methanol:H
 <sub>2</sub>O, 70:30, v/v) in an orbital shaker (GFL 3005, GEMINI, Apeldoorn, Netherlands). Afterwards, the suspensions were centrifuged (10,000 rpm, 4 ℃) for 15 min (Sigma 2-16KL Refrigerated Centrifuges, Sigma Laborzentrifugen, Berlin, Germany). The supernatants were collected in a 5 mL volumetric flask, and the solid residues were then extracted twice via the same procedure. All the three supernatants from successive extractions were kept together and the final volume came to 5 mL with the above-mentioned extraction solvent.
