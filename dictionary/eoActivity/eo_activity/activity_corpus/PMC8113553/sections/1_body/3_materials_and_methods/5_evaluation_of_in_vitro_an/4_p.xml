<p id="Par41">The FRAP working solution was prepared by mixing 10-volume acetate buffer (300 mM, pH 3.6), 1-volume TPTZ (10 mM dissolved in hydrochloric acid), and 1-volume ferric chloride (20 mM in water). The mixture was maintained at 37 ℃ for 10 min before use. The reaction of FRAP working solution (180 μL) and sample dilutions (20 μL) was kept at 37 ℃ for 30 min and the absorbance read at 593 nm.</p>
