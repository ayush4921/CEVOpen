 </sup>. The analysis equipment is composed of three parts, including LC pump (Surveyor), autosampler (Surveyor), and PDA detector (Surveyor). Sample extracts, in triplicate, and 31 pure standard compounds (all in HPLC grade), including 17 phenolic acids, 10 flavonoids, 2 phenylethanoids and 2 stilbenoids, were prepared and filtered through 0.45 μm PVDF filters (Millex-HV Syringe Filter Unit, Merck Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) and injected into a C18 column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm particle size; ACE, Aberdeen, Scotland), using a mobile phase composed of water/formic acid (99.9:0.1, v/v) (solvent A) and acetonitrile/formic acid (99.9:0.1, v/v) (solvent B). The linear gradient program (t in min and %B) was: t = 0–0%; t = 5–0%; t = 20–20%; t = 35–50%; t = 40–100%; t = 45–0%; and t = 65–0%. The injection volume was 20 μL and the flow rate was kept at 1.0 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup>. UV/Vis detection was recorded from 200 to 600 nm range. Peaks were monitored at 280 and 330 nm, and identified by congruent retention time compared with standards. Data acquisition, peak integration and analysis were performed using Chromeleon software (Version 7.1; Thermo Scientific, Dionex, USA). The three extracts of each medicinal plant were chromatographed and results were expressed in milligram per liter of sample extracts (mg L
