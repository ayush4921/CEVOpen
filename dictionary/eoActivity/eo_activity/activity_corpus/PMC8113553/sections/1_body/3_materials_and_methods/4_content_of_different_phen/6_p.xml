<p id="Par37">The content of tannins was evaluated both in treatment and control groups simultaneously, by adding 600 μL of methyl cellulose (MC) solution (treatment) or water (control) to 200 μL of sample in a 2 mL Eppendorf. The mixture was stirred manually for 2–3 min at RT. Four hundred μL of saturated ammonium sulfate and 800 μL of water were added successively both in the treatment and control groups until 2 mL of total volume was reached. The final mixture was vortexed and kept for 10 min. After centrifugation (10,000 rpm, 16 ℃, 5 min), the absorbance was read at 280 nm, by using a conventional spectrophotometer (Helios Gamma UV Spectrophotometer, Thermo Electron Corporation, Warwickshire, UK). The absorbance of tannins was obtained by subtracting the treatment absorbance from the value registered from the control, using epicatechin as standard. The results were described in milligrams of epicatechin equivalents per gram of plant dry weight (mg ECE g
 <sup>−1</sup> DW).
