<p id="Par28">Moreover, only a limited number of researches have pointed out the comparison of biological activities and phenolic components of the tested plant organs, which belong to tree plants or shrub plants with large or small leaves. Many authors have stated the importance of vegetables, fruits, medicinal and aromatic plants in the current dietary patterns

 </sup>. However, it doesn’t mean the agricultural and industrial waste like the tree leaves are useless for application. Extracts of olive leaves have attracted more attention recently, being reviewed as promising cheap, renewable and plenty source of bio-phenols for by-products. Some articles proved pomegranate leaf as a safe substrate due to its lower or inexistent toxicity

 </sup>. In addition, ellagitannins as effective ingredients in teas are considered to be more abundant in the large-leaf tree than those from the small-leaf tree

 </sup>. Therefore, as per olive leaf, research into finding new uses for by-products of pomegranate leaf may be proved as a strong argument for not only promoting human health but also improving bio-valorization and environment. However, samples of pomegranate leaves were not collected from different varieties or different seasons. Hence, studies on these issues would be of much interest in the future, in order to select the most promising matrix of the wasted bio-phenol materials.
