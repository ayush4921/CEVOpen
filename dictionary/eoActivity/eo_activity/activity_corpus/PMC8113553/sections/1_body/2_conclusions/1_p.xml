<p id="Par27">The level of different phenolic classes, antioxidant capacities and the phenolic profiles of seven medicinal and food plants were evaluated and correlated, including the leaves of sage, rosemary, olive, and pomegranate, as well as the leaves and young stems of rue, peppermint, and parsley. This study compared and demonstrated these plant extracts as valuable sources of bioactive compounds, likely for preparing novel functional products in various industries. High correlations of phenolic composition with antioxidant potential were investigated in our analysis. Different kinds of phenolic acids and flavonoids along with their derivatives were found widespread in the studied plant materials. Phenylethanoids especially oleuropein and its derivatives were characterized as the most abundant constituents of olive leaf extracts, probably contributing to its beneficial biological properties. While tannins particularly ellagitannins were supposed to be the main contributor to the features of pomegranate leaf. Interestingly, our results highlighted that the hydro-methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>Punica granatum</italic> L. (pomegranate) leaves displayed the greatest levels of free radical scavenging capacity and ferric reducing antioxidant power, as well as the highest contents of total phenols, 
 <italic>ortho</italic>-diphenols and tannins; a relatively high content of flavonoids was also found. Studies have increasingly evidenced the close association of tannins and less-studied compounds with antioxidant activity in medicinal and food plants

 </sup>. Thus it is expected that richer phenolic types, namely tannins and phenolic glycosides, and their higher concentrations, are maintained in pomegranate leaves, making it possible to explore active ingredients and bioavailable products in the food-pharm, nutraceutical or cosmeceutical industries.
