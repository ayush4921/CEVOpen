<p id="p0115">No any visible turbidity was detected at 50 µg/mL PFEO treated well when compared with untreated control of first well. Similarly, the percentage of microtitre plate result was exhibited the inhibition rate of 10% for 5 µg/mL and 52% for 30 µg/mL concentration (
 <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>a). Also, PFEO was found to be significantly reduced soon after starting the action of PFEO, which immediately went to decline phase. Based on the observation, the MIC of PFEO was fixed as 50 µg/mL against tested bacteria. The MBC result was exhibited same as MIC also observed and shown in 
 <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>b. Our result was indicated that the PFEO inhibit the CR 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> (MN396685) at concentration dependent manner. Further, the validation results of MBC was confirmed the MIC values at same concentration in MHA plate. In mechanistic approach, the PFEO may targeted the region of special outer membrane in CR 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> (MN396685) which can block a number of anions and harmful materials to come into cytoplasm (
 <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">Harder et al., 2003</xref>). The lipid bilayer surrounded teichoic acid and peptidoglycon of GNB outer membrane produced the negative charge in surface of the cell wall, which attracted transferred positive chemical substances of PFEO through outer membrane and leads to cell destruction (
 <xref rid="b0280" ref-type="bibr">Yoshikawa et al., 1994</xref>). The continuous action of PFEO damaged the integrated membrane and preventing the proliferation of bacteria and bacteria loss their virulence (

 <italic>C. japonica</italic> was more effective against CR 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> (MN396685)
