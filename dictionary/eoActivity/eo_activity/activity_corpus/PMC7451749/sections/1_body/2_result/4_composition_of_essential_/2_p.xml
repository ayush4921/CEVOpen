<p id="p0100">The hydrodistillation method by Clevenger apparatus of 
 <italic>C. japonica</italic> seeds given sweet and pleasant aroma dark green yellow oil with a yield of 0.17% based on the dry weight. The result of GC–MS was revealed various other compounds also present in the EO of 
 <italic>C. japonica</italic> seeds (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The GC–MS result was exhibited with 53 compounds and it indicating 90% of the total oil. On basis of the NIST identification, all the compounds were listed in 
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table. 1</xref>. Among the identified compounds, the α-terpineol, α-terpinolene, α-pinene, β-pinene, α-terpenyl acetate, spathulenol of the oil moieties were present more in the 
 <italic>C. japonica</italic> seeds. The EOs variations of present 
 <italic>C. japonica</italic> was different to that obtained from 
 <italic>C. japonica</italic> seed, Japan (
 <xref rid="b0270" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). On the other hand, the chemical composition of 
 <italic>C. japonica</italic> was significantly varied from compound moieties due to the influence of genetic factors, plant material, and harvesting time. In this study, we found most of the carboxylic acid, hydrocarbons, alcohol and esters with significant biological activity. Previously many researchers were reported with various biological activities of 
 <italic>C. japonica</italic> seeds from various places, they are effectively presented in 
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table. 2</xref>.
