<p id="p0080">According to the CLSI guidelines, all the Hexa discs results were exhibited more sensitive against tested 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae.</italic> The specific ESBLs and carbapenemase detection discs of cefpodoxime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, cefpodoxime/Clavulanic acid, ceftazidime/Clavulanic acid, cefoperazone/sulbactum, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefotaxime/Clavulanic acid, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid and imipenem, meropenem, ertapenem were did not produced better inhibition zones against tested 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a, b). These evidences was suggested that the bacteria has ESBL and carbapenemase producing ability due to the poor performance of performed antibiotics. Especially, the highest concentration of cefoperazone, cefoperazone/sulbactum, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid and piperacillin/tazobactam discs were not act better role against tested bacteria. In addition, the ceftazidime and cefotaxime of specific ESBL identification discs did not correlated with ceftazidime/Clavulanic acid and cefotaxime/Clavulanic acid antibiotics in any places. Similarly, the imipenem, meropenem and ertapenem of specific carbapenem identification discs were also exhibited the with ≤22 mm zone for ceftazidime and ≤27 mm zone for cefotaxime. The result was proved that the tested 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> strain was MDR bacteria, especially carbapenemase mediated drug resistant. The CLSI guidelines chart for ESBL and carbapenem resistant bacteria was available in our previously reported article (
