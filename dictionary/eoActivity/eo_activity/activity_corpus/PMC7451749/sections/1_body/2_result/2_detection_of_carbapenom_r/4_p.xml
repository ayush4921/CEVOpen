<p id="p0090">Further, the upper side of ESBL enzyme mix in both the MIC E-stripes exhibited 0.40 and 0. 39 mm zones and lower side of the specific ESBL enzyme detection and AMC ESBL enzymes stripes exhibited with 0.32 and 0.34 mm zone of inhibition were observed against tested 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>e, f). The result was exhibited with &gt;8 mm zone of inhibition. Finally, the MIC E-stripe method was proved, 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> was developed more resistant against current antibiotics, especially carbapenemase producer. Our MIC stripe result was correlated with previous report of 
 <xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">Rajivgandhi et al., 2018a</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0210" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et al., 2019</xref> with ESBL producing 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae.</italic> The WHO report also mentioned in 2017, &gt;8 mm of the bacterial zone against MIC stripes of ESBL detection antibiotics and AMP antiobiotics were more sensitive (2019). Hence, there is a new chemical derivatives of antibiotic was need to prevent the different kinds of MDR bacteria. Also, increasing scarcity for new idea to detect the appropriate inhibitor for combat the β-lactamase and carbapenemases, which have been very challenging against current antibiotics. Recent years, the medicinal plant and their EO have excellent alternate remedies against various antibiotic resistance infections.
