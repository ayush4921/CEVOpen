 <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">Maruthupandy et al., 2018a</xref>). In the epidemiological settings, it is very most important test for confirmation of carbapenemase-producing pathogens, a strong positive reaction is used as the criterion for a positive result (
 <xref rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr">Shaker et al., 2017</xref>). As per the guidelines, after added with phenol red, the internal control of imipenem containing well was completely changed their color from red to dark yellow within 2 h. Contrary, the control sample was exhibited with red color continuously. In the result of PFEO treated wells were could modify the yellow color to red color at 75 µg/mL. Initially, the moderate color changes were observed until 30 ug/mL concentration. After 35 µg/mL, the bacteria was lost their carbapenemase-producing ability completely due to the effect of PFEO. Therefore, our result was confirmed that the PFEO of

 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> (MN396685) (

Our result was agreed by and the hydrolytic degradation of carbapenemase using Carba NP test method advance than any other method, owing to its superior specificity and given uninterpretable results within 2 h. Recently, the complex mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance carbapenemase-producing bacteria was reported by

(2019c)</xref> and the absence of outer membrane permeability was leads to overproduction of cephalosporins and ESBLs or express a broad-spectrum β-lactamase without carbapenemase activity (ESBLs, plasmid and chromosome-encoded cephalosporinases.
