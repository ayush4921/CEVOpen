<p id="p0105">Anti-bacterial effect of EO and third generation cephalosporin antibiotics cefotaxime and doripenem against tested CR 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> (MN396685) are presented in 
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. The result was showed with moderate anti-bacterial efficiency against tested CR 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> (MN396685)
 <italic>,</italic> with inhibition ranging diameter of 16 mm zone at 60 µg/mL (
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>a, b). Whereas, the ceftazidime and doripenem was exhibited with no zone of inhibition. The result was suggested that the CR 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> (MN396685) was more sensitive to 
 <italic>C. japonica</italic> EO. The interaction between the EO and bacteria may be attributed to the presence of n-hexadecanoic acid as a sole sources, in fact palmitoleic acid, eicosenoic acid, tetracosenoic acid, 
 <italic>cis</italic>-13-Eicosenoic acid, Subashini, 1-mono-oleoylglycerol, myristic acid, pthalic acid, 
 <italic>cis</italic>-10-nonadecenoic acid, 6-octadecanoic acid, 9-octadecanemide, 1-allylazetidine have been known to possess anti-bacterial, anti-cancer, anti-viral and larvicidl activities (

 <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">Park et al. (2002)</xref> and his team, reported that EO of 
 <italic>C. japonica</italic> are known to be active against bacterial strains. Mechanistically, some plant essential oil constituents were surrounded with bioactive compound moieties, that used to performed highly in inside of the essential oil with low efficiency (Gupta et al., 2017; 
 <xref rid="b0275" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). They played a major role in inside of the bacterial that leads to cell wall destruction, QS inactivation, enzyme degradation and biofilm inhibition activity (
 <xref rid="b0220" ref-type="bibr">Soon-Young et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, 
 <italic>C. japonica</italic> EO of our study was found to be generally active against CR 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> (MN396685)
