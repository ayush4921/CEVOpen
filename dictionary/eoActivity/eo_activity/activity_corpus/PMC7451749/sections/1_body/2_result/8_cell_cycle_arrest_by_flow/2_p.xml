 <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">Elisha et al., 2017</xref>). To overcome this problem, the MIC od PFEO was treated cells was stained with AO/EB stains and examined under flow cytometry, which given as a real time assessment of bacterial viability (
 <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">da Silva et al., 2019</xref>). In staining result, the entire region of the places were covered with PI observed live and dead bacterial cells, indicating a shift of arranged peak in P1. The percentages differentiation of PI absorbance in dead and live cell cells were highlighting in the P2 region. Inhibition range of the dead cells were also observed in P3 region due to the decreased growth of the bacteria. 
 <xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>b of the P1, P2 and P3 of the scatter plot was indicated that the cells were significantly stained with PI and 98% of the cells were died due to the effect of PFEO. Whereas, the tightly arranged cells of P1, P2 and P3 of 
 <xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>a, indicated that the cells were could not observed the PI dye properly and exhibited with well developed bacterial growth. The result was clearly confirmed that the PFEO of
