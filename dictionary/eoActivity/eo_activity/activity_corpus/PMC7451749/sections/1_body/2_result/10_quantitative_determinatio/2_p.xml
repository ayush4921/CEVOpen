<p id="p0130">After incubation with PFEO treatment, all the wells of red color was changed to red color at increasing concentration, At 75 µg/mL, the red bright red color was produced in the treated well when compared with other wells. In this point, the result was indicated that the 75 µg/mL of the PFEO was very effective against CR 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> (MN396685) and involved in hydrolysis of β-lactam ring cleavage and stimulate the β-lactamase inhibition ability. Contrary, the internal control of untreated well was remained yellow color due to the carbapenamase production. It also suggested that the antibiotics imipenem could not undergo the β-lactam ring cleavage activity due to the production of carbapenemase (

 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> (MN396685) at 75 µg/mL. When compared with control and other wells, this inhibition rate was very high at 75 ug/mL. Based on the colorimetric variation, all the wells and their inhibition percentages were presented in
