<p id="p0135">The mechanistic approach of carbapenemase inhibition depends on the oxido-reductase process (

 <xref rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr">Shaaban et al., 2017</xref>). Further, these evidences were confirmed by measurement of the transferred molecules into the phenol red added by using colorimeter analysis (
 <xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">Seifert et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, the use of 5 M NaCL solution of quantitative method was also more advantages in colorimeter method. The sufficient NaCL concentration alter the pH slightly and its hyperosmotic properties lead to efficient lysis of the bacteria (
