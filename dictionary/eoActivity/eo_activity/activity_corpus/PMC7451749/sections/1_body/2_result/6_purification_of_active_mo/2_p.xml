<p id="p0110">The exact anti-bacterial compound from the EO was purified by using preparative HPLC using n-Hexane as a active solvent (
 <xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">Rho et al., 2019</xref>). After purification, the purified EO material was analyzed by analyticle HPLC for identified the different groups of compounds. In result, there are 12 different peaks were identified based on the retention time, area, height, area percentages and height percentages (
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>a). Among 12 fractions, fractions 2 and 3 only exhibited 24 mm and 18 mm inhibition zone against CR

 <xref rid="b0280" ref-type="bibr">Yoshikawa et al., 1994</xref>), and this mixed fractions were purified separately by preparative HPLC using same mobile phase, retention, flow rate, temperature and fraction time, and confirmed by analytical HPLC (
