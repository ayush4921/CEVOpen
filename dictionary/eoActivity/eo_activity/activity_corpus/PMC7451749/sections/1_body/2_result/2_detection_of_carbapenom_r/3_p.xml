 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>c, d). All the antibiotics zones were sensitive to bacteria. They cloud not reach the inhibition level of bacteria due to the target site modifications by chromosomal gene mutations, and inactivate the antibiotics through production of EPS, ESBLs, urease, biofilm formation, QS and efflux pump, penicillinase (
