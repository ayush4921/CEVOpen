<p id="p0140">The current was conclude, the plant 
 <italic>C. japonica</italic> EO has chemical composition of diverse biological importance. The destructive effect of the purified 
 <italic>C. japonica</italic> EO on carbapenem resistant bacterial membrane was observed with collapsed turbidity by minimum inhibition concentration assay. The more death cells of the bacteria was observed by SyTO 9/PI of CLSM and confirmed by flow cytometry. Finally, the carbapenemase enzyme inactivation in tested CR 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> (MN396685) was stimulated by treatment of 
 <italic>Camellia japonica</italic> EO. Overall, this finding is very promising and declare that the EO isolated from 
 <italic>C. japonica</italic> seeds can be used as a potential natural preservative ingredients in medical industry and would be helpful in the treatment of MDR infection.
