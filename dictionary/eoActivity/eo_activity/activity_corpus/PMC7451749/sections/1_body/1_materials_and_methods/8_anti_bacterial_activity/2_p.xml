 <xref rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr">Salem et al., 2018</xref>). The 24Â h old CR 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> (MN396685) culture was spread on the sterile muller hinton agar (MHA) plates. After, various concentrations of EO were added into the wells. Whereas third generation chaphlosporin antibiotic discs CTX and DOR were acted as a positive control for detection of ESBL production. After overnight incubation, the zone of inhibition around the EOs containing wells were calculated in diameter.
