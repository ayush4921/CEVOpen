 <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">Mancarz et al. (2019)</xref>. The GC–MS was equipped with GC 2010 plus coupled with triple-quadrupole mass detector, which was attached with an AOC 5000 auto sampler performed in liquid mode. Capillary column size of 25 m × 3 mm for divide, and carrier gas of helium with 1 mL/min flow rate. The n-hexane and 10 μg/mL volume of the sample was used at 1 μg concentration for injection with 1:10 split ratio. The detector and injector temperature was programmed from 40 to 250 °C and initial GC oven temperature was 60 μg for 5 min. The total analysis time was performed with 90 h. The 300 °C of transfer line temperature and MS ion sources were used at 250 °C. The mass range was programmed with 40–400

 <italic>z</italic>, which was received by electron ionization at 80 eV. Based on their retention indices (RI) and mass fragmentation patterns, all the chemical components of the oil were assisted by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) of Sun Yat-Sen University mass spectral libraries.
