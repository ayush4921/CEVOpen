<p id="p0060">The MIC of HPLC purified EO fraction (PFEO) was determined using micro broth dilution method with 96-well plate (
 <xref rid="b0255" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Aliquot 100 µL of overnight tested bacterial culture into the tryptic soy broth (TSB) containing wells. Various concentration of DMSO diluted PFEO was treated into the wells. Without addition of the oil and media alone containing well used as a control and blank respectively. As same as procedure was used for cefotaxime, imipenem and mirapenem (10% DMSO in the range of 1000–30, 10 and 10 μg/mL concentration respectively), which maintained as a positive control for detection of ESBLs and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Lowest concentration of PFEO inhibited the bacteria was noted based on the turbidity of growth and determined the O.D values by spectrophotometer.
