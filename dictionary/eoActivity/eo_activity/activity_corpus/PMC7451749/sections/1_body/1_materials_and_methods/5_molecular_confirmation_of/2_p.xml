<p id="p0035">Based on the carbapenem resistant activity, the genomic DNA of selected CR 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> was identified by multi plux PCR using universal primers (
 <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">Cusumano et al., 2019</xref>). The 16S rRNA sequences was extracted by based on the standard protocol including initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 m, and 35 cycle denaturation temperature at 96 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min and extension 72 °C for 2 min, and final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. After, the received PCR product was sequenced by automated sequencer (Shimadzhu, Japan) in Rajivgandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB), Kerala, India. The sequences were aligned carefully and detect the pairwise identities using NBLAST. Then, successive sequences were submitted in NCBI for receive the accession number. After, the accession number was noted and the applied to selected CR 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>. In addition, the genetic evidences of carbapenem producucing genes of selected 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> was detected by multiplux PCR method (
