<p id="p0075">The quantitative measurement of anti-carbapenemase activity was used to assess the 
 <italic>invitro</italic> Carba NP test result by colorimeter at 540 nm (
 <xref rid="b0250" ref-type="bibr">Vrioni et al., 2012</xref>). In this experiment, the 5 M NaCl solution was replaced nstead of B-PERRI lysis buffer to avoid misinterpretation. The test tube containing a loop of culture was mixed with 100 μl of 5 M NaCl solution and vortexed vigorously for 2 min. Then 50 µL supernatant was collected by centrifugation and 50 µL of corresponding enzymatic suspension were added into the 24-well polystyrene plate and mixed well. In addition, 100 µL of 3 mg/mL solution of imipenem monohydrate solution was added next to control wells. Finally, the different concentration of the PFEO was added in the remaining wells of pathogen plus imipenem at 37 °C for 24 h. Then, phenol red solution (pH 7.8) was added in all the wells and allowed to maintain 2 h (Merck Millipore, Guyancourt, France). After incubation, the color changes were obtained from the wells and determined at 540 nm by the colorimeter.
