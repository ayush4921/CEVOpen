<p id="p0055">Potential anti-bacterial components present in the EO was examined by analytical HPLC for detection of active fraction with the mobile phase of acetonitrile-methanol-0.2 m ammonium acetate-water (45:10:10:35) (
 <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">Rajivgandhi et al., 2019c</xref>). The agar well diffusion method was used to evaluate the essential oil fractions against CR 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> (MN396685). Further, excellent anti-bacterial activity of the oil fraction was purified separately by preparative HPLC and confirmed by analytical HPLC. The instrument of preparative HPLC was equipped with C18 coloumn, 140 × 4.6 mm with 4.6 µm of linear gradient and 1 mL/min flow rate at 240 nm. The elution program was set up with 0–10 min of 10–90% A, 10–11 min of 90–100% B and 11–20 min of 100% C and injection time volume was used with 20 µL. At the 40–60 °C temperature was used for entire experiment. Finally, purified sample was further performed separately against CR 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> (MN396685) and lyophilized at 40℃ by using lyophilizer for further study. The third generation chaphalosporin piperacillin/tazobactam and methanol was served as a positive and negative control respectively for detection of ESBLs production (
