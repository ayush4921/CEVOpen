 <italic>C. japonica</italic> was collected from Sun Yat-Sen University campus, Guangzhou, China. Five hundred gram of the fresh seeds were washed with DD·H
 <sub>2</sub>O and dried at lab condition in the shade for 20 days. Air dried sample was hydro distilled process using Clevenger apparatus (Shimadzhu, Germany) using n-hexane as a recovery solvent (Shimadzhu, Germany) using n-hexane as a recovery solvent. According to the previous method of 
 <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">Mitali et al. (2019)</xref>, the 250 g of the sample was placed into 5 L conical flask containing 2 L DD·H
 <sub>2</sub>O and then heated at 100 °C temperature for 2–4 h using heating mantle. The condensed liquid nature of the oil was recovered by the experiment and filtered in receiver tube. The water and EOs were extracted separately by using separating funnel and collected in measuring tube. The EOs was dried with anhydrous sodium sulphate for complete water removal. Finally, the purified EOs was recovered and stored at 4 °C for further use.
