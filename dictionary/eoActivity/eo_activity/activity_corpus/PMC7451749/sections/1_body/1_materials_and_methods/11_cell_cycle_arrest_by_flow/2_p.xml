<p id="p0065">Flow cytometric analysis was performed to identify the bacterial viability and growth cell arrest of CR 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> (MN396685) cells when treated with MIC of PFEO at 24 h using specific Live/Dead Bac Light kit (Shimadzhu, India) (
 <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">da Silva et al., 2019</xref>). After the time period, the cells were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 30 m and then rinsed with 1 mL cold water twice, filtered 1 × PBS (pH 7.5). Add 2 ul of Propidium iodide (PI) into the sample tube and vortexed followed by incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. As same as procedure of untreated bacterial cells in the PBS were acted as a control. After incubation, the inhibition range of treated and untreated cells were interpreted based on the PI absorption of flow cytometer (FACS MoFlo XDP Beckman Coulter). Analysis was performed in CyteExpert 2.1 software (Bruker, Japan).
