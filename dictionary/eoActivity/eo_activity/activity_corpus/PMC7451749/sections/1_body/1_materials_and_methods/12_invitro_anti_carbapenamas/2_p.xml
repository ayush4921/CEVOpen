 <xref rid="b0245" ref-type="bibr">van der Zwaluw et al., 2015</xref>). Shortly, the tested bacterial culture was taken into 24-well plate containing Tris-HCl 20 mmol/L lysis buffer (Bacterial Protein Extraction Reagent (B-PERRI), Shimadzu, Germany) and different concentration of PFEO was added into the wells except second well and incubated at 37 °C for 12 h. Based on the CLSI guidelines of 2017, to enhance the enzymatic quantity, bacterial culture one-third to one-half was used and incubated at 37 °C for 12 h supplemented with imipenem. After the 12 h incubation, 100 µL of the indicating solution contain pH indicator and phenol red was added into all the wells and noticed the carbapenemase activity within 2 h due to the color changes of phenol red solution. Result was concluding from hydrolysis of carboxylic derivatives of antibiotics, which decrease the PH value. The first well responds as a control, which containing pathogen and media. Second well responds as an internal control, which containing pathogen and antibiotics to stimulate the carabapenemase. Other wells loaded with the pathogen, imipenem plus the various concentrations of EO. According to the CLSI guidelines, the Carb NP test was interpreted as follows, no color changes of first well indicates that the bacteria did not produce any enzyme. The changes of the red color to yellow/orange in second and third wells indicates that the bacteria was produced carbapenemase. Whereas, the quick decolourization of yellow/orange color after the PFEO treated wells indicates that the PFEO acted as a important role in anti-carbapenemase activity by the hydrolysis of virulence molecules (
