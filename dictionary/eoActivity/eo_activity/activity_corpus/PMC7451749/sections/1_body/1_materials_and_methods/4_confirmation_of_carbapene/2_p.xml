<p id="p0030">The carbapenemase producing ability of selected 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> was determined by E-test MIC stripe assay (
 <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">Maruthupandy et al., 2018a</xref>). Briefly, two different type of gradient concentration E-stripes were used for detection of carbapenemase activity. In first stripe, the upper side coated with specific ESBL enzyme detection mix antibiotics (0.32–4 µg/mL) and lower side coated with specific ESBL enzyme detection antibiotic alone were prepared (0.125–16 µg/mL). Instead, the second stripe coated ESBL enzyme detection mix antibiotics in upper side (0.32–4 µg/mL) and AMC enzyme detection mix antibiotics in lower side were prepared (0.125–16 µg/mL). The MIC value was detected in µg/mL based on the CLSI guidelines (

The ESBLs of carbapenemase was indicated as positive, the result of zone exhibited the &gt;8 for Enz MIX, &gt;0.5 for ESBL detection antibiotic alone and &gt;1 for AMC enzyme detection mix were observed.
