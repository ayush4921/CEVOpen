<p id="p0010">Emergence of carbapenem resistant (CR) bacterial infections are a life threatening problem due to the production of multiple genetic and physiochemical mechanisms including mutation, horizondal gene transfer, alteration of target proteins, enzyme inactivation of antibiotics, quorum sensing, biofilm formation, extended spectrum beta lactamase production (
 <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">Rahdar et al., 2019</xref>). In particular, carbapenemase producing 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> is very most important bacteria among the 
 <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> family (
 <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">Cusumano et al., 2019</xref>). Carbapenemase is a type of beta-lactamases, it has the ability to hydrolyze oxy amine side chains of the carbapenems antibiotics, uncontrolled efflux pump expression. In addition, the antibiotics could not enter into the outer membrane of bacteria due to the production of porin mutations, and their carbapenamase production is increase the carbapenem resistance efficiency in bacteria (
 <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">Ece et al., 2018</xref>). Various classes of carbapenemases were emerged recently with different mechanisms of carbapenems hydrolysis activity including IMP, VIM, NDM, CMY and PDC beta-lactamases, OXA (

 <xref rid="b0210" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et al., 2019</xref>). All of these genes were encoded by plasmid and pose a vigorous spread of carbapenem resistance nature (
 <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">Hamoud et al., 2014</xref>). Different researchers have been reported different kinds of mechanism for carbapenem resistant bacteria, but so far, the exact mechanism is not fully understood (
 <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">Borer et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, there is an emerging need for developing novel and potent antibiotics targeting the carbapenem resistant GNB, especially CR
