 <italic>C. japonica</italic> and 
 <italic>C. oleifera</italic> are frequently used in cooking oil and the cultivation and utilization are very high in China (
 <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">Bin et al., 2019</xref>). Some of the species are used to famous ornamental values and produce colorful flowers with long time fluorescence and striking aromas. The high quality of various 
 <italic>Camellia</italic> species seed oils was highly produced in Taiwan high level in house cooking. In particular, the high content of unsaturated fatty acids contained leic acid and linoleic acid of 
 <italic>C. japonica</italic> used to human health (

 <italic>.</italic> The rich unsaturated fatty acid sources of 
 <italic>Camellia</italic> species is the topmost oil compared with other olive oils. It is used in the format of ‘‘omega meals for human. The high level squalene and flavonoids content of the vitamin E is more in
