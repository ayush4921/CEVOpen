<p>SARS‐CoV‐2 is a positive‐sense, single‐stranded RNA beta‐coronavirus with ~28,882 base pairs genome that encodes viral proteins in up to 14 open reading frames (Orfs) (Malik et al., 
 <xref rid="ptr6893-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). There are four major viral structural proteins: Spike (S), Envelope (E), Membrane (M), and Nucleocapsid (N). Structural proteins of SARS‐CoV‐2 form the viral capsid that encapsulates the genome and also facilitates the entry process to human cells through the ACE‐2 receptor (Figure 1S in

Usually, viral diseases are difficult to control and have a more comprehensive public health impact, so viral pathogens like HIV, human influenza, SARS, chikungunya, Ebola, Zika have received more attention and have threatened modern healthcare and pharmaceutical sectors. Many infections and abnormal physiology caused by several viruses belonging to coronavirideae family been reported (Table 1S in
