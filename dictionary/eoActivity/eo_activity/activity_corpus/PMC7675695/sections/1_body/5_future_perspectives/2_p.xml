<p>Several synthetic drugs are showing inefficiency for the treatment of patients suffering from SARS‐CoV‐2, so herbal medicines have become a promising option to tackle the ongoing pandemic caused by COVID‐19. Some of the Chinese plant extracts have already been examined for the treatment of COVID‐19 patients in the clinical setting and have shown effective outcomes for the palliation of symptoms (Luo et al.,

 <xref rid="ptr6893-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). Use of diammonium glycyrrhizinate with vitamin C for the treatment of COVID‐19 associated infections has been approved via a randomized, controlled, and open clinical trial in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Hubei, China where safety and efficiency of diammonium glycyrrhizinate with vitamin C for the treatment of COVID‐19 infected patients was investigated but clinical use has not commenced yet. Except earmarking on viral protease, replication, spike protein, and receptor, its protein kinase C and helicase have also been established as potential targets to inhibit SARS‐CoV (Hoever et al.,

 <xref rid="ptr6893-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Glycyrrhizin has been revealed as a potential inhibitor of SARS CoV protein kinase C and similarly, myricetin and scutellarein as aptitude inhibitor of viral helicase (Xian et al.,

The National Health Commission (NHC) of China has recommended a couple of plants originated medicines for the treatment of SARS‐CoV‐2 patients. China used a similar treatment strategy even in 2003 when the SARS‐CoV outbreak was reported. Chinese experts claim that herbal drugs such as

Plant‐based medicines were also deployed in the earlier two outbreaks of coronavirus, which were SARS‐CoV of 2003 and MERS‐CoV of 2012 (“Redeploying Plant Defences,”
