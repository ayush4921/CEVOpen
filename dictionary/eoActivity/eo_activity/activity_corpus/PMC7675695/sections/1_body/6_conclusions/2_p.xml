<p>There are barely any countries that are left untouched by the COVID‐19 pandemic. It is one of the greatest public health threats to date that needs to be controlled as soon as possible. Still today, there are no vaccines or drugs that have been clinically proven against COVID‐19. Many secondary metabolites with antiviral properties have been isolated from medicinal plants. Various researches have been carried out throughout the world to develop antiviral drugs effective against SARS‐CoV‐2 responsible for COVID‐19. The best way of preventing COVID‐19 infections could be finding the compounds responsible for altering or disturbing any steps of the virus replication cycle. Natural products capable of inhibiting or altering the configuration of structural proteins (spike glycoprotein), non‐structural proteins (3‐chymotrypsin‐like protease, papain‐like protease, helicase, and RdRP) and accessory proteins coded by SARS‐CoV‐2 genome are needed to be explored. Usually, natural products could be a safe, secure, and dependable source to find drugs responsible for controlling the current pandemic. Protease and RNA polymerase inhibitors known to be active against SARS and MERS are also required to be explored. Different compounds (flavonoids, polyphenols, alkaloids, proanthocyanidins, and terpenoids), which are already known to have antiviral activities, need to be rapidly screened for the treatment of SARS‐CoV‐2 infected patients. In the context of not having proven medication of COVID19, patients depend on supportive care and symptomatic therapy. Hence, many herbal extract and natural products may help to treat the symptoms associated with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.</p>
