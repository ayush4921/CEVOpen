<p>To assess the biological activities of CBD and hemp seed oils in vitro, ABTS and DPPH assays were performed (
 <xref rid="medicines-07-00057-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The DPPH and ABTS assay results indicated that antioxidant activities in the CBD oil samples were higher than those in the hemp seed oil samples. The CBD oil samples (C1 and C2) showed dose–response DPPH scavenging activities with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 17.9 and 18.6 µL/mL, respectively. The CBD oil samples (C1 and C2) also showed dose–response ABTS scavenging activities with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 2.3 and 3.6 µL/mL, respectively. To confirm the antioxidant activity of the CBD oil samples, the DPPH and ABTS scavenging activities were evaluated using a CBD standard. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of the CBD standard in the DPPH and ABTS assays were 584 and 92.2 µM, respectively. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of the CBD oil samples (C1 and C2) calculated using each concentration obtained from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-07-00057-f001">Figure 1</xref> were respectively 1075 and 522 µM in the DPPH assay, and 138 and 67 µM in the ABTS assay. These results indicated that the antioxidant potential of CBD oil could be attributed to CBD.
