<p>Herein, two CBD and seven hemp seed oil samples were evaluated, while rapeseed oil was used as a CBD-free sample. To quantify the CBD concentration of CBD and hemp seed oils, HPLC analysis was performed. A calibration curve was constructed using CBD standards (100, 50, 25, 12.5, 5 and 0.5 µg/mL). The linearity plot and chromatograph are shown in the 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-medicines-07-00057">Supplementary Materials</xref>, and the linearity coefficient of determination (R
 <sup>2</sup>) was 0.995. From 
 <xref rid="medicines-07-00057-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, the LOD, LOQ, as well as intra- and inter-day RSD were 1.5 µg/mL, 4.6 µg/mL, 4.2% and 2.4%, respectively.
