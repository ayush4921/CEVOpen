<p>Using the HPLC method, CBD and hemp seed oil samples were analyzed. Because CBD exists primarily in the carboxylated form, cannabidiol acid (CBDA), in fresh

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-07-00057-f001">Figure 1</xref>. The CBD oil samples (C1 and C2) showed concentrations of 18.9 ± 0.5 and 9.2 ± 0.4 mg/mL, respectively, which were nearly equal to the value displayed on the product description (500 mg/30 mL and 300 mg/30 mL, respectively). Of the seven hemp oil samples tested, six contained CBD concentrations ranging from 2.0 ± 0.1 (C6) to 20.5 ± 0.5 (C4) µg/mL, and CBD was not detected in one hemp seed oil sample (C7) or rape oil sample (C9).
