<p>In this study, we analyzed the CBD contents and antioxidant activities of CBD and hemp seed oils commercially available in Japan. The CBD contents of hemp seed oils varied by sample. Because CBD oil samples exhibited strong antioxidant activities, antioxidant assays represent a useful marker for distinguishing between CBD and hemp seed oils. Our results could be applicable for the quality control of CBD and hemp seed oil products.</p>
