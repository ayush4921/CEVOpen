<p>HPLC analyses were performed using an Alliance Waters e2695 (Waters) and Alliance Waters 2998 PDA detector. An XTerra MS C18 column (3.5 µm, 4.6 mm × 150 mm, Waters) was used with an isocratic mobile phase of water (0.1% formic acid): acetonitrile 3:7 at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min for 30 min. The column temperature was set to 35 °C and sample injection volume was 10 µL. The chromatograms were monitored at 235 nm. The HPLC analysis for CBD detection and validation was based on previously reported methods with modification [

 <xref rid="B19-medicines-07-00057" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. CBD and THC reference standards were obtained from Cayman Chemical, Michigan, USA and Sigma-Aldrich, USA, respectively. Standard stock solutions of CBD (100 µg/mL) were prepared in methanol, and calibration curves were prepared with the CBD standard at concentrations of 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 5 and 0.5 µg/mL (

The instrumental limit of detection (LOD) values were calculated using the following formula: LOD = (3.3 × σ)/m, where σ is the residual standard deviation of the calibration curve and m is the calibration curve slope. The limit of quantification (LOQ) values were determined according to the following formula: LOQ = (10 × σ)/m. The intra-day repeatability of the method was assessed by analyzing three replicates of the samples injected thrice on the same day. The relative standard deviation (RSD) of the three replicates was also calculated.
