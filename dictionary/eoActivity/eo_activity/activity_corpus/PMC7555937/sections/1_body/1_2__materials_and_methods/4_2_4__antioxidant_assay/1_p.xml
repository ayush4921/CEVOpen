<p>2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2′-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical-scavenging assays were performed. The oils (250 µL) were extracted with 1 mL methanol for 10 min with occasional shaking. After incubation, the supernatant was used as the sample solution. The DPPH assay was performed according to a previously described protocol [

 <xref rid="B21-medicines-07-00057" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In a total volume of 200 µL, 180 µL of 100 µM DPPH dissolved in methanol and 20 µL of the samples dissolved in methanol were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The absorbance of the mixture was measured at 517 nm using a microplate reader (Molecular Devices SPECTRA MAX M2). The ABTS radical-scavenging activity was determined according to a previously described assay with some minor modifications [

 <sub>2</sub>O and 2.45 mM potassium persulfate were mixed in a 1:1 ratio. Then, the solution was diluted in methanol at a 1:25 ratio. In a 96-well plate, 180 µL of the diluted solution and 20 µL of each sample dissolved in methanol were mixed and incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and absorbance was measured at 734 nm. The percentage enzyme activity inhibition was calculated by comparison with the negative control: Inhibition (%) = 100 × (A
 <sub>0</sub> − A
 <sub>1</sub>)/A
 <sub>0</sub>, where A
 <sub>0</sub> is the negative control absorbance and A
 <sub>1</sub> is the sample absorbance. For each sample with a percentage inhibition of &gt;60%, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were determined from a dose–response curve with eight different concentrations. Ascorbic acid was used as a positive control.
