 <italic>Cannabis sativa</italic> L. has been cultivated worldwide for centuries for medicinal, industrial and recreational use. The characteristic compounds of 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic> L. are cannabinoids, including delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) [
 <xref rid="B1-medicines-07-00057" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. THC is the main psychoactive compound, whereas CBD is non-psychoactive and can effectively treat epilepsy and other neuropsychiatric disorders [

 <italic>C. sativa</italic> or hemp, which contains little or no THC [

 <xref rid="B12-medicines-07-00057" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The omega-6 to omega-3 ratio in hemp seed oil is considered to be nutritionally optimal [

 <xref rid="B13-medicines-07-00057" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Considering that hemp seed produces no cannabinoids in its metabolic pathways, it could be contaminated with resin from the flowers and leaves, which contain cannabinoids, during hemp seed processing [
