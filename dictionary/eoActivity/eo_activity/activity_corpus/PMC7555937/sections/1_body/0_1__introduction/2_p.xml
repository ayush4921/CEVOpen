<p>Few reports have been published on the CBD quantification of CBD oil products marketed in Japan, or on the existence of CBD in hemp seed oils commercially available in Japan. In addition, some products are marketed without a clear distinction between CBD and hemp seed oils. Essential oil obtained from hemp is commonly studied using a multidisciplinary approach for evaluating various biological activities, including antioxidant capacity, enzyme inhibition, antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity on cell lines [

Herein, commercially available CBD and hemp seed oil products were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Additionally, their antioxidant activities were determined.
