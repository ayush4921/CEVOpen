<p>Herein, it was found that six of seven hemp seed oil products contained CBD, while the concentration varied by sample. Therefore, the unintended intake of CBD from hemp seed oil products might occur. Considering the adverse effects of CBD, including developmental toxicity, embryo-fatal mortality and neurotoxicity, unintended consumption of CBD should be avoided [

In this study, THC was not detected in any samples. Previous reports showed that some hemp seed oil products contained cannabinoids, including CBD and THC [

In addition, some products are marketed without a clear distinction between CBD and hemp seed oils. Therefore, the quality control of CBD and hemp seed oil products is necessary. In the antioxidant assays, the CBD oils exhibited free radical scavenging activities in a CBD dose-dependent manner. Because the DPPH and ABTS assays are simple and rapid, antioxidant activity represents a useful marker for distinguishing between CBD and hemp seed oils. Previously, the antioxidant activities of cannabinoids and

 <xref rid="B18-medicines-07-00057" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore, the ratio of antioxidant activity determined by DPPH assay to that by ABTS assay might be useful information for the quality control of CBD oils to avoid contamination with THC.
