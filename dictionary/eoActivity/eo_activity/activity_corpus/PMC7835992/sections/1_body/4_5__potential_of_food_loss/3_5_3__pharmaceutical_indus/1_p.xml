<p>There has been a considerable increase in the manufacture of synthetic antimicrobial compounds against microorganisms that cause respiratory diseases, infections, or conditions in humans [
 <xref rid="B282-molecules-26-00515" ref-type="bibr">282</xref>]. Worldwide, the pharmaceutical sector reached a CAGR of 8.8%, exceeding $1 billion in 2017 [
 <xref rid="B283-molecules-26-00515" ref-type="bibr">283</xref>]. According to a study carried out by IQVIA, the sector should experience market growth between 3 to 6% over the next five years, exceeding 1.5 trillion dollars in 2023 [
 <xref rid="B284-molecules-26-00515" ref-type="bibr">284</xref>]. However, the synthetic compounds in pharmaceutical products contain contraindications and side effects that can lead to the appearance of new health alterations and create resistance in bacterial strains [

 <xref rid="B286-molecules-26-00515" ref-type="bibr">286</xref>] evaluated the gene expression of the efflux pump (a mechanism that evaluates the resistance of microorganisms in drugs) in 31 clinical isolates of strains of 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, determining gene mutations in 66.6% of the isolates (overexpression of the pump flow). Due to this, medicinal research against new alternatives in the preparation of drugs that do not affect health in the background has been of great interest in recent years, emphasizing bioactive compounds from plants, fruits, and functional foods [
 <xref rid="B287-molecules-26-00515" ref-type="bibr">287</xref>]. The food industry generates many by-products worldwide that are discarded from the food transformation process that have a high content of compounds required as a raw material in the manufacture of medicines [
 <xref rid="B288-molecules-26-00515" ref-type="bibr">288</xref>]. For this reason, research on the use of citrus fruit by-products has had a significant boom in recent years due to its antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antifungal properties.
