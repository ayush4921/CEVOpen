<p>Currently, the world is affected by the pandemic crisis caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV-2), a descendant of the SARS-CoV coronavirus family, which causes the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) [
 <xref rid="B317-molecules-26-00515" ref-type="bibr">317</xref>]. This virus consists of a genome of positive-sense single-stranded RNA, enveloped by a lipid membrane with structural proteins. The structural proteins are the protein S (glycoprotein homotrimer) responsible for the appearance and recognition of receptors on the target cell, the protein M (membrane glycoprotein) with greater abundance on the surface of the virus, which defines the shape of the lipid membrane, and protein E (a small membrane protein) involved in several processes of the viral cycle [
 <xref rid="B318-molecules-26-00515" ref-type="bibr">318</xref>]. Due to the accelerated increase in cases of contagion and the chronic affectations that this virus presents, alternative drugs, and compounds have been studied for the prevention and inhibition of the virus, such as Arbidol, with a direct antiviral effect on the early viral replication of the virus, Remdesivir, which has a significant effect against a wide range of RNA virus infections, and Lopinavir, a protease inhibitor [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-00515" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Because it is a recently discovered virus, studies in the formulation of a vaccine require an intense investigation of highly efficient compounds to eliminate the virus [
 <xref rid="B318-molecules-26-00515" ref-type="bibr">318</xref>]. However, medical advances in antibody development have accelerated vaccine development. At least 240 vaccines are currently in process (phase I), 44 in clinical trials (phase II) at the time of the writing of this review, so the number of vaccines in development increases daily [
 <xref rid="B319-molecules-26-00515" ref-type="bibr">319</xref>]. Six vaccines are currently in phase III [Johnson &amp; Johnson (United States), AstraZeneca (University of Oxford, United Kingdom), Sinovac (China), Sinopharm (China), Moderna (United States), and Pfizer (United States)] [
 <xref rid="B320-molecules-26-00515" ref-type="bibr">320</xref>]. In this phase, the vaccine’s safety and efficacy against the SARS-CoV-2 virus are more fully evaluated until reaching the final phase (IV), where it is approved [
 <xref rid="B320-molecules-26-00515" ref-type="bibr">320</xref>]. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) report, vaccines’ effect in providing an immune barrier still needs more research [
 <xref rid="B321-molecules-26-00515" ref-type="bibr">321</xref>]. The food loss and wastes present bioactive compounds that generate medicinal effects such as the inhibition of viral activity and the reduction of inflammation in the affected organism, such as hesperidin, a phenolic compound with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory properties, which production could be less expensive. For this reason, the potential of hesperidin, mostly found in the by-products of citrus fruit peels, has been studied (
