 <xref rid="B290-molecules-26-00515" ref-type="bibr">290</xref>]. The extraction of these compounds from by-products is carried out by several routes [
 <xref rid="B291-molecules-26-00515" ref-type="bibr">291</xref>]. In the case of phenolic extracts such as hesperidin, nobiletin, and tangeretin, there are currently ecological techniques such as hydroalcoholic extraction [
 <xref rid="B292-molecules-26-00515" ref-type="bibr">292</xref>], which is 90% efficient both on a laboratory scale and on a pilot scale, and hydrodistillation applied mostly to the shells of citrus which provides 17% more performance than conventional methods [

 <xref rid="B295-molecules-26-00515" ref-type="bibr">295</xref>]. Ultrasonic extraction with organic solvents offers advantages with much faster extraction rates than the medium and low energy consumption in conjunction with the MTT assay method that reflects the cellular viability due to the antimicrobial capacity of bioactive compounds [
