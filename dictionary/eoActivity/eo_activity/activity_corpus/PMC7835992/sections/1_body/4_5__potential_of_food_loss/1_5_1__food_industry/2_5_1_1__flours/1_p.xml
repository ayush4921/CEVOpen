<p>Flours are physically characterized as fine powders obtained from the cereal grinding or starch present in food. Among the most common are wheat, corn, sorghum, rye, and oat flour. It is considered one of the main foods in the human diet [

 <xref rid="B223-molecules-26-00515" ref-type="bibr">223</xref>]. The seeds, peels, and fruit pomace generated in the processing of food products present nutritional and sensory components, which are of great interest for preparing functional foods, thus reducing the addition of components in flours to obtain food products [
 <xref rid="B224-molecules-26-00515" ref-type="bibr">224</xref>]. Consequently, studies have been carried out for the partial substitution of wheat, oat, and cornflour for peel, seed, and fruit pomace flour to prepare functional foods (
