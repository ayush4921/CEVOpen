<p>According to biological terminology, the word virus originates from the Latin 
 <italic>virus</italic> meaning toxin or poison [
 <xref rid="B306-molecules-26-00515" ref-type="bibr">306</xref>]. Viruses are acellular infectious agent particles with nucleic acids (deoxyribonucleic acid, DNA, and ribonucleic acid, RNA) [
 <xref rid="B307-molecules-26-00515" ref-type="bibr">307</xref>]. They are classified mainly by their phenotypic characteristics such as nucleic acid type, proteins, replicative cycle, and the viral infection produced [

 <xref rid="B308-molecules-26-00515" ref-type="bibr">308</xref>]. The evolution of viruses has increased their ability to multiply within the infected cell because they cannot do it by themselves due to the lack of necessary molecular material [
 <xref rid="B309-molecules-26-00515" ref-type="bibr">309</xref>]. Viruses have been the leading cause of severe and chronic infections, causing the death or degeneration of host cells, capable of multiplying rapidly in the human body. Due to their rapid evolution, several mutations have produced new deadly diseases [

Therefore, scientific studies in the field of medicine have expanded their perspective to new alternatives to counteract viruses such as hepatitis, Ebola, MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), H7N9 (avian influenza virus), Crimean-Congo fever, among others [
