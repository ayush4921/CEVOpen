<p>One of the significant waste producer industries is the food industry, accounting for 70% of agricultural waste in the world [

 <xref rid="B218-molecules-26-00515" ref-type="bibr">218</xref>]. In the search to introduce these residues to food production, analyzes have been carried out against the components that can be exploited within the residual biomass [

 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-00515" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Likewise, to reduce waste, action must be taken from the source, reducing the excessive amount of raw material used in industries and implementing monocultures through the formulation and execution of comprehensive management plans [
 <xref rid="B220-molecules-26-00515" ref-type="bibr">220</xref>]. That is why the investigations of extraction, characterization, and application of residues from the food industry are of great interest for their use as by-products, giving alternatives on the excellent management of residues and the minimization of the indiscriminate use of natural resources contributing to a transition from the linear economy to a circular economy [
