<p>The agri-food industry generates a large amount of waste that can be applied for food, medicinal, and skincare products by extracting bioactive compounds. Flours obtained from seeds and skins of fruits and cereals presented better sensory and nutritional characteristics in the partial substitution of 10, 20 and 30% of wheat flour and corn in the preparation of bread and cookies, having a consumer acceptance of 90 to 100%. Fruit peels are a good source of colorants that, in addition to contributing to the color in bakery products, provide antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capabilities, proposing their application in the development of new functional foods. Likewise, they are an excellent substrate to produce bromelain enzymes of great interest at an industrial level. Studies carried out to date indicate that the phenolic compounds present in citrus fruit residues have a broad medicinal activity, increasing the protection capacity against chronic diseases such as cancer thanks to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial properties. On the other hand, tangeretin, nobiletin, and hesperidin turn out antigens’ inhibitors fighting respiratory and hepatic viruses, exhibiting a potential application in pharmaceutical applications. To develop the industry in the extraction of natural colorants from FLW, extraction methods must be carried out more thoroughly on a pilot scale, expanding the panorama and the techno-economic feasibility due to consumers’ great demand to acquire clean product labels.</p>
