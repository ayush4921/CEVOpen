<p>Incorporating this proposal in the food production processes would expand the circular economy concept because there are avoidable and unavoidable losses and waste in the food system. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), waste can be classified as waste and losses. Losses occur during agricultural production and processing, while waste occurs during consumer consumption [

The integration of natural and industrial materials of Food Losses and Waste (FLW) is developed in a sustainable process where avoidable waste (food in the optimal condition that is not consumed) is not left aside, which can be returned to the environment (
