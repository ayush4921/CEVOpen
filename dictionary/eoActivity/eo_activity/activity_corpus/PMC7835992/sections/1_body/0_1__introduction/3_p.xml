<p>The generation of FLW worldwide is much higher in developed countries. According to Van der Werf and Gilliland [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-26-00515" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], are produced 198.9 kg/year per capita of FLW in developed countries. In the United States, the FLW covers 40% of the whole food production chain [

 <xref rid="B9-molecules-26-00515" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The European continent represents a third (20%) of the FLW generated worldwide [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-26-00515" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], while in Latin America, FLW is estimated as 15% of total food production, which represents 6% of FLW worldwide [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-26-00515" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, the generation and accumulation of FLW imply a significant impact on biodiversity, human health, and climate change [
