For this reason, one of the objectives of this review is to compile various studies related to the integral recovery of by-products from the processing of fruits, vegetables, tubers, cereals, and legumes in the food industry, showing the potential of phenolic compounds present in their by-products in the SARS-CoV-2 virus and bacterial diseases treatments. Noteworthy is also the review of various works that obtained bioactive components, fibers, enzymes, and flours for their functional foods and the cosmetic industryâ€™s application. This review is also intended to contribute to the paradigm-shifting towards a circular economy by highlighting various studies around the world that demonstrate the value and application of these wastes in other industries, reducing the indiscriminate disposal of waste.
