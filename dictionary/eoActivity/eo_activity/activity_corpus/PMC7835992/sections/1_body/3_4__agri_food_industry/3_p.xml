<p>On the other hand, the high number of products generated in the market, the lack of technological innovations in the processing of raw materials and infrastructure, inadequate food safety protocols, overcooking, unwanted sizes and weights in food, the defects of the packaging and labeling, are aspects that contribute to the food waste generation during the food supply chain, also with bad cultural habits for the purchases and consumption [

On the contrary, they are discarded to landfills that increasingly occupy more land, contaminating soils, surface, and underground waters, increasing the ecosystem’s imbalance due to the agricultural sector’s indiscriminate production [
 <xref rid="B79-molecules-26-00515" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. For this reason, it is necessary to study their chemical composition and their potential to introduce them as a raw material in several industrial processes, evolving towards a circular economy [

Following the above, this section will discuss the different agricultural industries such as the fruit and vegetable industry, the tuber industry, and the cereal and legume industry, establishing the production data, the operational processes where the residues are generated, and their main components.
