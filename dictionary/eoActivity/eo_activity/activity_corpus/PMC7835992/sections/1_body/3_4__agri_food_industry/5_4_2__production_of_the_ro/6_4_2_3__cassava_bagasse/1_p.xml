<p>Bagasse is generated during the sieving or straining stage, where the pulp is separated from the fibrous material, constituting 10% of the processed cassava residue [

Under these conditions, bagasse presents a higher volume than the raw material represented by 60 to 90% of water and 10 to 30% of starch and fiber in dry weight [
