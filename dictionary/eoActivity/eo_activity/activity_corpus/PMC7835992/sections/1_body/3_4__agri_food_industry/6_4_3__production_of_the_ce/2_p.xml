<p>In the industrial processing of cereals and legumes, food products such as flour, corn flakes and oats, and canned legumes are prepared, while edible oil is extracted from their seeds, such as soybean oil [

The cereal grains and legumes must go through specific stages for their conditioning according to the final productâ€™s physical characteristics, such as dehulling, grinding and sieving, and mechanical or solvent extraction of vegetable oils (
