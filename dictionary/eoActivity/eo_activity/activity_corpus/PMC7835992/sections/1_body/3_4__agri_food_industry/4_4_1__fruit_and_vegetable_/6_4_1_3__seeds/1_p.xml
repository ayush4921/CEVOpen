Tomato seed, one of the most abundant residues due to its extensive production in the market for pasta and sauce preparation, provides an essential source of unsaturated fatty acids, especially linoleic acid. Likewise, lycopene is the carotenoid responsible for the fruitâ€™s red color with greater abundance in the peel [
