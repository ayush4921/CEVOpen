<p>China is the worldâ€™s largest cereal producer, followed by the United States, India, and Indonesia, with high consumption of processed foods such as croquettes, flours, and snacks [

In the processing of cereals and legumes, specific processes are required for optimal transformation, such as size reduction (if the final products are flours and canned goods), extraction of shells and functional compounds, pressing, drying, among others [

Grain and legume shells, cake (cocoa or cereal), bagasse (beer), and pulp waste are among the essential wastes generated, which are generally discarded in landfills or water sources, increasing the pollution of the environment and wasting their chemical and nutritional potential [
