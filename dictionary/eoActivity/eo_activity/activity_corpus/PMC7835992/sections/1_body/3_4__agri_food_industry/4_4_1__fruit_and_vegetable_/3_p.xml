<p>Within the transformation of fruits and vegetables, specific industrialization processes are developed such as dehulling or peeling, blanching, core removal, and pulping, which have temperature, humidity, and pH control systems for optimal conservation (

However, it is possible to identify some basic transversal processes in the different industrialization processes, such as cleaning, sterilization, and pasteurization, that determine food safety [

However, the horticultural industry generates significant losses of optimal raw material for human and animal consumption due to its high production. The food loss and waste correspond to biomass rich in bioactive compounds, enzymes, vitamins, and fibers, obtained through extraction processes and chemical transformation for animal and human nutrition or even to be used in biorefinery applications [
