<p>The processed root shells are between 2 and 15% of their total weight, usually generated in the peeling stage [

More than 11 million tons of peels are currently generated worldwide, where a small percentage are processed and used as feed animal ingredients due to the protein content. However, they are harmfully disposed of in landfills and water, mishandling these wastes [
