<p>Essential oils extracted from 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> have received much attention lately. In the early 1990s, different research teams extracted essential oils from different parts of sumac—especially its fruits—in an attempt to identify the chemical constituents of the oils using hydro-distillation as an extraction approach. It is worth noting that the yield of the oil using this extraction method is usually around 0.1% as 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> is considered to be an essential oil-poor plant [
