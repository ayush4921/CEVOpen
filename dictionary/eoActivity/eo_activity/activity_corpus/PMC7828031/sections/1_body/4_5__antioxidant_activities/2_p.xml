<p>Antioxidant agents have been used in the treatment of skin disorders for their ability to efficiently reduce the damage induced by sunlight [

 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> L. fruit on microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1), a model of the skin microvascular endothelium cells, have been investigated [
 <xref rid="B45-antioxidants-10-00073" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Importantly, a protective role of 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> L. extract against UV-A-induced damage was reported. Indeed, 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> extract not only reduced the level of UV-A-induced ROS production, but also significantly blocked the formation of DNA lesion in cells exposed to medium UV-A doses [
 <xref rid="B45-antioxidants-10-00073" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In contrast, when cells were exposed to higher and more damaging doses of UV-A, 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> extract promoted cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [
 <xref rid="B45-antioxidants-10-00073" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. However, the molecular mechanism through which the extract exerts its antioxidative and genoprotective effects remain unclear and thus warrant further investigations.
