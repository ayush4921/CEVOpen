<p>Our findings revealed that according to GC/MS, eighteen compounds were identified, making up 98.99% of the total essential oil. The major constituents were terpinolene (77.72%), n-nonanal (4.47%), and linalool (4.35%), respectively. The study conducted by Rustaiyan et al. (2005) demonstrated that according to GC/MS analysis, the main constituents of 
 <italic>F. macrocolea</italic> essential oil were β-pinene (15.9%), α-pinene (10.4%), and β-caryophyllene (8.6%), respectively [

 <italic>Ferula</italic> spp. essential oil were terpenoid compounds such as α-pinene, β-pinene, terpinolene, α-terpineol, myrcene, etc. [
