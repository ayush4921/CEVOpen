<p>A Hewlett-Packard 6890 with an HP-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm; film thickness, 0.25 mm) was applied to perform the GC analysis. The column temperature was maintained at 50 °C for three minutes, programmed to increase to 290 °C at a rate of 15 °C per min, and kept constant at 290 °C for five minutes. The injector and interface temperatures were 250 and 280 °C, respectively. The flow rate of helium, the carrier gas, was 1 mL/min C.F. The percentages were determined by the electronic integration of the FID peak areas without the use of response factor correction. The linear retention indices for all the components were determined by the coinjection of the samples with a solution containing a homologous series of C8–C24n-alkanes. GC/MS analysis was conducted by means of a Thermoquest-Finnigan gas chromatograph equipped with a fused silica capillary DB-5 column (30 m × 0.25 mm; film thickness, 0.25 mm) coupled with a TRACE mass (Manchester, UK). The range of mass was from 40 to 400 u. The compounds of FMEO were determined through the comparison of their relative retention times and mass spectra with the standard Wiley 2001 library data for the GC/MS system or with data reported in the literature [
