<p>Here, the colorimetric protease assay Sigma Kit was applied to assess the apoptotic activity through the evaluation of the caspase-3-like activity of FMEO on protoscoleces. The test was performed based on the measurement of the color spectrophotometric changes created by the release of a molecule (pNA attached to the substrate) by the action of the enzyme caspase-3. After the exposure of protoscoleces to FMEO for 2 days, they were then centrifuged at 600 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The sedimented protoscoleces were lysed and then centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 10 min. In the next step, 5 μg of supernatant was mixed with 85 μL of buffer and 10 μL of caspase-3 (pNA-DEVD-Ac) substrate and was again incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Finally, the absorption of the samples was read at 405 nm with an ELISA reader.</p>
