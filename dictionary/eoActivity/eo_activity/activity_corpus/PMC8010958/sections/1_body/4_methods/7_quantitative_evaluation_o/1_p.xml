<p id="Par59">Biofilm formation by 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> isolates was induced in triplicate using 96-well sterile flat-bottomed polystyrene microtiter plates (Techno Plastic Products, Switzerland) as documented elsewhere [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]
 <bold>.</bold> In brief, an aliquot of 200 μL of an initial bacterial suspension (10
 <sup>6</sup>CFU/mL) in TSB was added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The wells were carefully aspirated and washed twice with 200 μL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) to remove the planktonic bacteria then air-dried for 15 min. Biofilms were stained with 0.1% (w/v) crystal violet (100 mL per well) for 30 min then the wells were washed twice with PBS and air-dried. The stained biomass was resuspended in ethanol/acetone solution (80:20, v/v), and the optical density (OD) was determined using the ELISA reader (stat fax 2100, USA) at 570 nm
 <bold>.</bold> Wells originally containing non-inoculated medium as well as a biofilm-producing bacterium (
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> ATCC 13813) were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. Cut-off optical density value (OD
 <sub>cut</sub> = OD
 <sub>avg</sub> of negative control + 3 × standard deviation (SD) of ODs of negative control) was used for categorizing 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> isolates based on biofilm-forming capacity as following: No biofilm producer (OD ≤ OD
 <sub>cut</sub>), weak biofilm producer (OD
 <sub>cut</sub> &lt; OD ≤ 2 × OD
 <sub>cut</sub>) moderate biofilm producer (2 × OD
 <sub>cut</sub> &lt; OD ≤ 4 × OD
 <sub>cut</sub>) or strong biofilm producer (OD &gt; 4 × OD
 <sub>cut</sub>) [
