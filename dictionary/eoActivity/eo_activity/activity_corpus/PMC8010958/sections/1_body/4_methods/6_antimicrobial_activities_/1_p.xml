<p id="Par57">The antimicrobial activities of cinnamon oil and AgNPs were assessed against the planktonic MDR 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> isolates. The agar well diffusion assay was applied as described elsewhere [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], and the isolates with inhibition zones` diameters ≥8 mm were considered susceptible [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and MBC of the tested antimicrobial agents were determined using the broth microdilution technique [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Moreover, the MIC50 and MIC90 were calculated using an orderly array method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. The interactions of the antimicrobial combinations were analyzed by a checkerboard assay [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. The combination is considered synergistic when the ΣFIC is ≤0.5, indifferent when the ΣFIC is &gt; 0.5 to &lt; 2, and antagonistic when the ΣFIC is ≥2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].
