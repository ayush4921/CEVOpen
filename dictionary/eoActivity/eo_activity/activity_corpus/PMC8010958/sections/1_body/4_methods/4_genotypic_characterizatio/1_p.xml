<p id="Par53">The genomic DNA was extracted using a QIAamp DNA Mini kit (Qiagen GmbH, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Conventional PCR-based amplification of 
 <italic>tuf</italic> gene [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], followed by DNA sequencing, was applied to confirm the identification of streptococci isolates. PCR products (196 bp) were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA) then sequenced by the BigDyeR Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, USA) in an ABI 3130 automated DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, USA). The 
 <italic>tuf</italic> gene sequences (
 <italic>n</italic> = 14) were compared with those previously deposited within the GenBank database using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI,
