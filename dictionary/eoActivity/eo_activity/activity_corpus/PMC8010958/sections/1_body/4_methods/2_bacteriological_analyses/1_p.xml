<p id="Par51">Bacteriological examination of milk samples was performed according to the procedures employed previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Briefly, 1 mL of each thoroughly mixed milk sample was transferred to 10 mL of brain heart infusion (BHI; Oxoid, Hampshire, England, UK) broth then incubated at 37 °C for 18 h to resuscitate the microorganisms. A loopful of the pre-enriched milk sample was plated onto Edward’s agar medium (Oxoid, Hampshire, England, UK) and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. A single, well-isolated colony was subcultured onto a blood agar base (Oxoid, Hampshire, England, UK) enriched with 7% sterile defibrinated sheep blood and incubated aerobically at 37 °C for 24–48 h. The plates were examined for their typical growth, morphological features, and hemolytic characteristics. Growth at 10 and 45 °C, at pH 9.6, and in 6.5% NaCl, in addition to the resistance to the bile salts, were investigated for separating 
 <italic>Enterococci</italic> from 
 <italic>Streptococci</italic> species [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. A bacitracin sensitivity test was applied for differentiating 
 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> (sensitive) from other bacitracin-resistant streptococci (
 <italic>S. agalactiae, S. dysagalactiae</italic>, and group D non-enterococcus streptococci) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Christie, Atkins, and Munch-Petersen (CAMP) test was applied to distinguish 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> isolates (CAMP-positive) [
