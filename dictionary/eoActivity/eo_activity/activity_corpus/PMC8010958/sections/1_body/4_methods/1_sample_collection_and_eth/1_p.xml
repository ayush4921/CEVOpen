<p id="Par50">Clinical samples were obtained from eight dairy herds in different Governorates in Egypt, during the period from September 2016 to March 2018. Quarter milk samples were aseptically collected from 200 Holstein Friesian cows (Frisona GmbH, Germany) with clinical mastitis (each quarter represented an animal) in compliance with the recommendations of the National Mastitis Council [

Individual quarter milk samples were then collected aseptically in sterile plastic screw-capped tubes. New latex gloves were used for each sampling procedure from each cow. Milk samples were kept at 4 °C in an insulated icebox and transported to the Bacteriology Laboratory, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Zagazig University, Egypt, for further investigations. Criteria describing clinical mastitis were low milk yield, abnormal milk secretion (watery, bloody, or purulent), presence of flakes or clots, and the cardinal signs of inflammation on infected mammary quarters. Recruitment of dairy cows into this work was done in consultation with veterinarians, and sampling was performed after the permission of dairy farms` owners. The study was approved by the committee of Animal Welfare and Research Ethics, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Zagazig University, Egypt.
