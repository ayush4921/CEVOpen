<p id="Par62">After the biofilms were grown as described before, strong biofilm producer 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> isolates (code Nos. 3 and 10 in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) were exposed separately to the MBIC
 <sub>50</sub> of cinnamon oil (2, 4 μg/mL), AgNPs (32, 64 μg/mL) and their combination (1/2, 8/16 μg/mL), respectively, then incubated at 37 °C for 12 h. 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> biofilm producers receiving no treatments served as controls. The biofilms were carefully harvested and gently washed with PBS to remove non-adherent cells. Total RNA was extracted from biofilms of treated and non-treated 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> isolates using a QIAamp RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The relative expression levels of pili biosynthesis genes [
 <italic>pilA</italic> (
 <italic>sag1407</italic>) and 
 <italic>pilB</italic> (
 <italic>sa</italic>g1408)], and their regulator (
 <italic>rogB</italic>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] were determined by one-step RT-qPCR using QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, Germany) in the MX3005P real-time PCR thermal cycler (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Each sample was subjected to RT-qPCR in triplicate, and the mean values were used for subsequent analysis. Oligonucleotide primer pairs used in the RT-qPCR technique are listed in Additional File 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>. The specificity of the amplified products was verified by generating melting curves (one cycle of 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 94 °C for 1 min for each 
 <italic>pilA</italic>, 
 <italic>pilB</italic>, and 
 <italic>rogB</italic> genes)
 <italic>.</italic> The relative expression levels of the tested genes were normalized to the constitutive expression of the 
 <italic>gyrA</italic> housekeeping gene. The fold changes in the transcript levels of targeted genes in treated 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> biofilm producers relative to their levels in the untreated ones were calculated according to the comparative 2
 <sup>−ΔΔCT</sup> method [
