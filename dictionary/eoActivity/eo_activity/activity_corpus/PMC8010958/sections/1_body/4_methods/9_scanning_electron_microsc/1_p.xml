 <italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic> strong biofilm producers (code Nos. 3 and 10 in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) reported in the current study were treated for 5 h with the MBIC
 <sub>50</sub> of cinnamon oil (2, 4 μg/mL), AgNPs (32, 64 μg/mL) and their combination (1/2, 8/16 μg/mL), respectively. The isolates were fixed using 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (Ladd Research Industries, USA) at pH 7.2 for 2 h at room temperature. For SEM, post-fixed cells were dehydrated using a series of ethanol washes (15, 30, 50, 70, 80, 90, 95, and 100%), critical-point dried in CO
 <sub>2</sub>, coated with gold, then examined using a JEOL, 6510 scanning electron microscope (JEOL, 6510 series, Japan) [
