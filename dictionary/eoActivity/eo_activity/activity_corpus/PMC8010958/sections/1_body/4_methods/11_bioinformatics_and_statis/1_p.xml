<p id="Par63">The data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], and the 
 <italic>P-value</italic> of &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically different. The differences between means were detected by Duncan’s multiple range test [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Correlation analysis was performed using Pearson’s correlation test according to the CORR procedure. These analyses were performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS; v. 25, IBM, United States). For each antimicrobial compound understudy, the average percentage of biofilm inhibition was shown as mean ± standard error. The number of isolates showing certain MBIC
 <sub>50</sub> was plotted for each compound. Student 
 <italic>t-</italic>test (unpaired, two-tailed) was used to determine if there were significant differences between the MBIC
 <sub>50</sub> of 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> isolates exposed to each antimicrobial compound. These analyses were done using GraphPad Prism version 8 for Windows, San Diego California USA,
