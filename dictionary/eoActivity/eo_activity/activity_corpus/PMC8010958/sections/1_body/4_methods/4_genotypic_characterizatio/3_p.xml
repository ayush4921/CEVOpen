<p id="Par55">All PCR amplification reactions were performed in a PTC-100™ programmable thermal cycler (MJ Research Inc., Waltham, USA) with a final volume of 25 μL of the following reaction mixture: 12.5 μL Dream
 <italic>Taq</italic> Green PCR Master Mix (2X) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA), 1 μL of each primer (20 pmole), 2 μL template DNA and 8.5 μL water nuclease-free. The amplified cDNAs were electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) stained with 0.5 μg/mL ethidium bromide (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). A 100 bp DNA ladder (Fermentas, USA) was used as a molecular weight marker. The gel was visualized using an ultraviolet transilluminator (Spectroline, Westbury, USA) then photographed. The band intensity of each target gene and the 
 <italic>gyrA</italic> housekeeping gene were quantified using ImageJ software (

 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> ATCC 27956) and negative (PCR reaction mixture without DNA) controls were included in all PCR approaches.
