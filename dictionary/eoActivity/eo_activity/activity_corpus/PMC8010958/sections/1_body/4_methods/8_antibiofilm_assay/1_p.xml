<p id="Par60">Investigation of cinnamon oil or AgNPs effects on mature biofilms of 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> was carried out by the broth microdilution technique, as stated elsewhere [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] with modification. Briefly, 20
 <italic>μ</italic>L of cell suspension (10
 <sup>6</sup>cells/mL) was added to each well having 180 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of TSB. After 24 h of biofilm maturation, the medium was aspirated off, and each well was washed using sterile PBS. Two hundred microliters (200 μL) of TSB containing various concentrations of cinnamon oil (1024–0.25 μg/mL) or AgNPs (512–0.25 μg/mL) were added, followed by incubation of the plates for 24 h. The percentage of biofilm inhibition was calculated according to the following equation: 1 - (A
 <sub>570</sub> of the test isolate/A
 <sub>570</sub> of non-treated control isolate) × 100, where A is the absorbance value at 570 nm using the ELISA reader (stat fax 2100, USA). The minimum biofilm inhibitory concentrations (MBIC), the lowest concentrations that exhibited a 50% or 90% inhibition of biofilm formation (MBIC
 <sub>50</sub> and MBIC
 <sub>90</sub>, respectively), were then evaluated
 <bold>.</bold> Moreover, the interactions of cinnamon oil with AgNPs against biofilm formation were then evaluated by the checkerboard method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], and fractional MBICs were computed as described before [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. The negative controls (non-biofilm producers) and the positive controls (wells containing biofilms) were involved. All the procedures were carried out in triplicate.
