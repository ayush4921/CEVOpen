 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> isolates were then screened for the expression of six virulence genes, namely, 
 <italic>hyl</italic> (encoding hyaluronate lyase) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], 
 <italic>cylE</italic> (encoding β-hemolysin/cytolysin) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], 
 <italic>sip</italic> (encoding surface immunogenic protein) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], 
 <italic>scpB</italic> (encoding C5a peptidase) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], 
 <italic>rip</italic> (encoding rib surface protein) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], and 
 <italic>lmb</italic> (encoding laminin-binding protein) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], by a semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR. The 
 <italic>gyrA</italic> gene was used as an internal amplification control [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Total RNA extraction was accomplished using a QIAamp RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the supplier’s protocol. RNA purity, integrity, and concentration were assayed using Spectrostar NanoDrop™ 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA). Reverse transcription of mRNA into complementary DNA (cDNA) was performed using a High-Capacity RNA-to-cDNA™ Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Oligonucleotide primers, product sizes, and annealing temperatures used for all PCR assays are listed in Additional File
