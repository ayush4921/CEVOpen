<p id="Par52">Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> isolates against 15 widely used antimicrobial agents (Oxoid, Hampshire, England, UK) was applied according to the standardized disc diffusion method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The following antimicrobials were tested: Penicillin G (10 U), amoxicillin (25 μg), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (20/10 μg), cloxacillin (1 μg), cefoperazone (75 μg), ceftriaxone (30 μg), cephalexin (30 μg), imipenem (10 μg), streptomycin (10 μg), ciprofloxacin (5 μg), tetracycline (30 μg), clindamycin (2 μg), erythromycin (15 μg) and trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole (1.25/23.75 μg). The inhibition zones` diameters were interpreted following the standards available in the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The isolates displaying resistance to ≥3 different antimicrobial classes were categorized as MDR. The MAR index for each isolate was calculated as follows: Number of antimicrobials to which the isolate displayed resistance/Number of antimicrobials to which the isolate had been tested; while the MAR index for each antimicrobial = Total number of resistance scored / (Total number of antimicrobials tested × Total number of the isolates) [
