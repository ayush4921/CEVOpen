<p id="Par49">Our findings provide a comprehensive overview of the bactericidal activity of cinnamon oil and its synergistic effect with AgNPs against planktonic cells of 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> recovered from clinical mastitis. Moreover, this work is the first to demonstrate the antibiofilm potency of cinnamon oil against preexistent biofilms of 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> isolates. These results exhibited the potential of natural products as a promising alternative for improving future dosing strategies to treat 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> infections in bovine mastitis.
