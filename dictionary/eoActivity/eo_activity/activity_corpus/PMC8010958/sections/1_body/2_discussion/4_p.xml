<p id="Par39">Antimicrobial resistance among streptococcal mastitis isolates has become an increasingly prevalent problem in Egypt. In the current study, 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> exhibited complete resistance to 10 out of 15 tested antimicrobial drugs. Likewise, high levels of resistance to clindamycin (80%), erythromycin and tetracycline (68% each), amoxicillin (60%), and penicillin (52%) were previously reported in a recent study in Egypt [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In another study in China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], 88.9% of streptococci isolates recovered from mastitic cows were MDR. It is widely assumed that amoxicillin and cephalexin exhibited the best activity against streptococcal mastitis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, the emergence of resistance to both antibiotics was previously documented [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], which is consistent with our findings. Hence, this study suggests the need for judicious use of antimicrobial agents in veterinary medicine to avoid the increase and spreading of antimicrobial resistance in animals and humans. Moreover, the search for new and appropriate effective antimicrobial compounds is urgently recommended particularly, against contagious mastitis pathogens as 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic>.
