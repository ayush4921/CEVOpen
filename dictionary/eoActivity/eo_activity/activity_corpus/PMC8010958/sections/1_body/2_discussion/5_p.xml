<p id="Par40">In this study, cinnamon oil showed strong inhibitory activity against 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> isolates (inhibition zone diameters ≤40 mm and MIC values ≤0.063 μg /mL). However, in a previous study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], it was reported that 
 <italic>trans-</italic>cinnamaldehyde demonstrated high bactericidal activity against planktonic cells of 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> causing bovine mastitis with a MIC value of 0.5 mg/mL. The bioactive components of the essential oils act on cell membrane integrity by altering membrane permeability, resulting in leakage of electrolytes and loss of vital intracellular contents. Additionally, they inhibit the adenosine triphosphate generation and related enzymes. Those can detrimentally influence cell metabolism and lead to cell death [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Moreover, the combination of nanoparticles with various compounds has displayed potent antimicrobial effects on different microbial pathogens, particularly those displaying resistance to conventional antibiotics [
