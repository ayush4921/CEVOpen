<p id="Par38">The expression of virulence genes in 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> isolated from clinical cases of bovine mastitis could explain a probable implication of these genes with the pathogenesis of mammary infections. In this investigation, the expression of virulence genes required for colonization and adherence (
 <italic>lmb, scpB)</italic> as well as invasion (
 <italic>cylE</italic> and 
 <italic>hyl</italic>), was reported in all tested 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> isolates by a semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR, suggesting that these isolates state a greater probability of causing the disease. A perusal search of the literature revealed scarce reports available on the expression of the virulence determinants of 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> accused of bovine mastitis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], however, their existence was numerously investigated. In previous reports, the existence of 
 <italic>scpB</italic> and 
 <italic>lmb</italic> genes was reported in 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> derived from mastitic cattle in the Middle East [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. 
 <italic>CylE</italic> gene was found in bovine 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> in Poland [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], while the 
 <italic>hyl</italic> gene existed in bovine but not in human invasive 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> isolates in New York [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].
