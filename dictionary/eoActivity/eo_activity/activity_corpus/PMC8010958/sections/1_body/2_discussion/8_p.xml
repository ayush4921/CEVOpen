<p id="Par43">Time-kill kinetic study indicated that cinnamon oil AgNPs combination exhibited bactericidal activity against 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> isolates as 100% inhibition of planktonic cells was achieved over the first 4â€‰h of exposure compared to the control untreated isolates. Accordingly, AgNPs activity may be strongly enhanced when utilized in the presence of cinnamaldehyde as previously documented [
