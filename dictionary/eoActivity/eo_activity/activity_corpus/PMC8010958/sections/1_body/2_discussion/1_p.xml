<p id="Par36">Mastitis is a common disease in dairy animals worldwide. It causes morbidity in highly productive cows and financial losses in the dairy industry. Contagious pathogens as 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] are important etiological bacterial agents causing mastitis in dairy cows with an increasing tendency worldwide. Unconventional therapies as Ethnoveterinary medicine have been given more attention since bacterial pathogens causing mastitis are becoming progressively resistant to conventional antimicrobial therapy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. We inferred that new clinical mastitis treatment strategies, particularly against contagious pathogens, should be implemented in Egyptian dairy herds. Therefore, the antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of cinnamon oil, AgNPs, and their combination were investigated against MDR 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> isolates.
