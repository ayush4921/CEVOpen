<p id="Par46">To investigate the influence of antimicrobial agents understudy on the biofilm integrity of 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic>, an SEM experiment was applied. The results revealed that 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> biofilms were seriously damaged after exposure to MBIC
 <sub>50</sub> of cinnamon oil than that was observed in AgNPs cinnamon oil combination. Meanwhile, only a slight surface crack was detected in the biofilm after AgNPs treatment. Similarly, only simple surface fissures were observed in the preformed biofilm of an MDR 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> strain isolated from a mastitic dairy cow when examined by SEM after treatment with AgNPs [
