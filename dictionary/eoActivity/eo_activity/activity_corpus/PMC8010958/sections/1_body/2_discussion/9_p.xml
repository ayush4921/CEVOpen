<p id="Par44">Current antimicrobials have a restricted effect on biofilms. Adhered bacteria in these communities have distinct physiological features compared to free planktonic cells. These features can protect the bacteria against host immunity as well as the antimicrobial drugs, resulting in persistent infections and difficult treatment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In this study, cinnamon oil exhibited a higher antimicrobial action against the preexistent biofilms of 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> (MBIC
 <sub>50</sub> 4 μg/mL) than that observed by AgNPs (most repeated MBIC
 <sub>50</sub> is 64 μg/mL). However, AgNPs cinnamon oil combination moderately increased the antibiofilm efficacy of AgNPs with an MBIC
 <sub>50</sub> range of 1/2–32/64 μg/mL. To our knowledge, there were no published data regarding the use of cinnamon oil or AgNPs as alternative antimicrobials against biofilm production by 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> isolated from clinical mastitis. Also, the current study appears to be the first to explore the antimicrobial potentials of cinnamon oil combined with AgNPs toward the planktonic or biofilm-producing 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> field isolates.
