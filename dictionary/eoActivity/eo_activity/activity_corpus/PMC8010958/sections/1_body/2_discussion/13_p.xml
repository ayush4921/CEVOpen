<p id="Par48">Thus, the biofilm components could be potential new targets for new anti-mastitis agents. However, there are no available in vivo studies supporting the hypothesis that biofilm-producing microorganisms contribute to the resistance to antimicrobial agents more than their planktonic counterparts as well as the persistence of intramammary infections on the farm. The knowledge gained from our study could be viewed as an in vitro preliminary validation of natural products for the mitigation of bacterial resistance. However, no way supports the clinical use of these compounds in mastitis treatment without in vivo studies. Further in vivo studies in animal models should be carried out to show (i) a proof of concept of the therapeutic potential of the examined antibacterial agents against streptococcal mastitis, (ii) their anticipated effects on the udder tissue, and (iii) food safety implications, including meat and milk withhold times.</p>
