<p id="Par25">Medicinal plants, with their well-established history, are an excellent natural product resource used as an alternative therapy. Cinnamon oil could be an interesting candidate owing to its antimicrobial properties [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The antimicrobial activity of cinnamon oil is attributed to cinnamaldehyde, which interacts with the microbial cell membrane by changing the proton motive force and evolving to cell lysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Moreover, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been intensively reported as antimicrobial agents, including their use against multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The antimicrobial activity of AgNPs is thought to be mediated by (i) microbial cell adhesion, (ii) cell penetration, (iii) reactive oxygen species and free radical generation, and (iv) microbial signal transduction pathway modulation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Studies exploring the virulence traits of Egyptian 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> isolates and their ability to produce biofilms are scarce. Thus, we sought to identify the virulence characteristics required for 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> causing bovine mastitis. Moreover, the antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of cinnamon oil, AgNPs, and their combination were investigated as effective alternative approaches against MDR 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> isolates.
