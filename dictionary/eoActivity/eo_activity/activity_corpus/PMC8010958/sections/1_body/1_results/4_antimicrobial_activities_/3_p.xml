<p id="Par31">To assess the killing kinetics of MIC levels of cinnamon oil, AgNPs, and their combination against MDR 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> isolates, the viability of the cells was evaluated in a multi-time point assay (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The MIC level of cinnamon oil significantly reduced (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) the planktonic cell population by approximately 1–3 log
 <sub>10</sub> colony-forming units (CFU)/ mL after 10 h of incubation, while no CFU was detected after 12 h of incubation. Also, AgNPs significantly decreased (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) the number of viable cells but with lower efficacy (2 log
 <sub>10</sub> after 24 h of incubation). However, exposure of the bacteria to cinnamon oil AgNPs combination resulted in 100% inhibition of bacterial cells within 4 h, demonstrating that AgNPs enhanced the antimicrobial effect of cinnamon oil.
