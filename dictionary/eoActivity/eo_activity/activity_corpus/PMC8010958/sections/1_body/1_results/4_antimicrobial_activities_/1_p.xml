<p id="Par29">The antimicrobial potentials of cinnamon oil or AgNPs against virulent and MDR 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> were assessed by evaluating the inhibition zones` diameters and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The essential oil diluent, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), was inactive against all investigated isolates. Cinnamon oil exhibited a marked inhibitory effect against 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> with inhibition zones` diameters up to 40 mm. This efficacy was reflected with the low recorded MICs (≤ 0.063 μg/mL). However, AgNPs demonstrated moderate antimicrobial action against analyzed isolates with inhibition zones` diameters and MIC values up to 31 mm and 16 μg/mL, respectively. For all screened isolates, cinnamon oil and AgNPs showed 2-fold higher minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values than their recorded MICs, indicating their bactericidal effect. Furthermore, the MIC50 and MIC90 values of cinnamon oil (0.016 and 0.008 μg/mL, respectively) and AgNPs (8 and 16 μg/mL, respectively) against 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> isolates were recorded.
