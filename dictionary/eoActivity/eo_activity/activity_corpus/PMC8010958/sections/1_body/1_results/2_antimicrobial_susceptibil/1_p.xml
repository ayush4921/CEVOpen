<p id="Par27">The in vitro antibiogram results of 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> isolates (
 <italic>n</italic> = 14) against 15 widely used antimicrobials of 7 chemotherapeutic classes are included in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> showed high susceptibility to imipenem and ciprofloxacin (100% each), followed by trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (71.43%). However, a full resistance (100%) was observed towards penicillin G, amoxicillin, cloxacillin, ceftriaxone, cefoperazone, cephalexin, streptomycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, and erythromycin. All 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> isolates were categorized as MDR, and their multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) indices were far greater than 0.2 (0.71–0.86).
