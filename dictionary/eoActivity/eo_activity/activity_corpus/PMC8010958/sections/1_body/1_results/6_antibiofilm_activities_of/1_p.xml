<p id="Par33">The effects of cinnamon oil, AgNPs, and their combination on preexisting biofilms produced by 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> are shown in Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. The antibiofilm activities seem to be concentration- dependent (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Our results revealed a good antibiofilm activity (&gt; 50% inhibition of biofilm formation) of cinnamon oil against the preformed biofilms of 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> isolates with the most repeated minimum biofilm inhibitory concentrations
 <sub>50</sub> (MBIC
 <sub>50</sub>) of 4 μg/mL (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>). However, the antibiofilm activity of AgNPs was lower than cinnamon oil with the most repeated MBIC
 <sub>50</sub> of 64 μg/mL (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). The results were compared with the untreated (positive controls) 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> biofilm producers as well as the negative controls (non-biofilm producers). Interestingly, AgNPs cinnamon oil combination has a moderate ability to remove the preformed biofilms by 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> isolates with MBIC
 <sub>50</sub> range of 1/2–32/64 μg/mL (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). The ΣFIC of their MBIC
 <sub>50</sub> values revealed an interactive category of addition in 4 isolates only, other isolates (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10) showed an antagonistic interaction.
