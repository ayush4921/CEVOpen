 <sub>50</sub> of cinnamon oil, AgNPs, and their combination on the preexisting biofilms of strong biofilm-producing 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> isolates reported here (
 <italic>n</italic> = 2), the transcript levels of biofilm-associated genes; 
 <italic>pilA</italic> and 
 <italic>pilB,</italic> and their regulator (
 <italic>rogB</italic>) were determined by reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Data analysis indicated that 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> isolates showed low transcript levels of pili biosynthesis genes (
 <italic>pilA</italic> and 
 <italic>pilB</italic>) in response to the down-regulation of 
 <italic>rogB</italic> gene in all treatments when compared to the untreated biofilm-producing isolates. The lowest mRNA expression levels of 
 <italic>rogB</italic> (0.372 ± 0.016 fold), 
 <italic>pilA</italic> (0.475 ± 0.031 fold), and 
 <italic>pilB</italic> (0.613 ± 0.046 fold) genes were ubiquitously detected in the isolates exposed to the MBIC
 <sub>50</sub> of cinnamon oil alone followed by cinnamon oil combined with AgNPs (0.545 ± 0.052, 0.708 ± 0.,044 and 0.676 ± 0.081 folds for 
 <italic>rogB</italic>, 
 <italic>pilA</italic>, and 
 <italic>pilB</italic> genes, respectively). Meanwhile, the entire set of the tested genes decreased to lower extents (0.673 ± 0.053, 0.775 ± 0.048, and 0.795 ± 0.005 folds for 
 <italic>rogB</italic>, 
 <italic>pilA,</italic> and 
 <italic>pilB</italic> genes, respectively) after exposure to the MBIC
 <sub>50</sub> of AgNPs. Statistical analysis revealed significant (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) positive correlations (
 <italic>r</italic> ≥ 0.3) between the transcript levels of 
 <italic>rogB</italic> regulatory gene and pili biosynthesis genes for all tested isolates (Fig.
