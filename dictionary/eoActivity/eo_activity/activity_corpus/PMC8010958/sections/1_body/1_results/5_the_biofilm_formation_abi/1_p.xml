 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> isolates using the crystal violet staining method resulted in a range of absorbance values from 0.484 to 1.121. All tested 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> isolates turned out to be biofilm producers; among them, 2 (14.29%), 2 (14.29%), and 10 (71.43%) isolates were categorized as strong, moderate, and weak biofilm producers, respectively, all were resistant to at least 10 antimicrobial agents (Table
