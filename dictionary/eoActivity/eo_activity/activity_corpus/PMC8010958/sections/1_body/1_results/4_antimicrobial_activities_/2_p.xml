<p id="Par30">As depicted in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, the results of fractional inhibitory concentration index (ΣFIC) of the checkerboard assay showed a synergistic interaction between cinnamon oil and AgNPs against all 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> isolates. It is noteworthy that when the two compounds were combined, the MICs of cinnamon oil and AgNPs significantly (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) decreased 4 to 512 fold and 32 to 128 fold, respectively, indicating that the activity of the combined antimicrobial agents against planktonic 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> isolates was higher than the sum of their independent activity.
