<p id="Par34">The impact of cinnamon oil, AgNPs, and their combination on the biofilm integrity of strong biofilm producer 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> isolates reported in this study (
 <italic>n</italic> = 2) was investigated via SEM. The results showed that the biofilms of control untreated strong biofilm producer isolates were compact and integral. When the MBIC
 <sub>50</sub> of cinnamon oil, AgNPs, and their combination were added, the biofilms were damaged to variable degrees compared to the control non-treated isolates (Additional File 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). When the cultures were exposed to cinnamon oil, the biofilms were seriously damaged. Meanwhile, the biofilms of AgNPs treated isolates showed only slight surface crack, and it was possible to observe the biofilms with apparently fewer cell layers. The biofilms of the AgNPs cinnamon oil combination-treated isolates were hardly damaged to a lower extent than cinnamon oil-treated ones indicating that cinnamon oil alone exhibited more potent inhibitory activity against biofilm formation of 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> than AgNPs either alone or in combination.
