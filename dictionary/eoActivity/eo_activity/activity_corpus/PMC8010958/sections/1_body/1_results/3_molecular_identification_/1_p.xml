 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> isolates were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based amplification of the 
 <italic>tuf</italic> gene (196-bp amplicons) followed by DNA sequencing. Direct sequencing of the amplified products revealed 180-bp sequences between the forward and reverse primers. These sequences were highly conserved among 
 <italic>Streptococci</italic> species and presented high nucleotide sequence identities ranged from 98.89–99.44% with the previously deposited sequences of 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> strains in the GenBank database. Further, the 
 <italic>cfb</italic> gene confirmed 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> isolates at the species level (153-bp amplicons). 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> isolates were tested by a semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR for the expression of a panel of genes potentially involved in virulence along with the 
 <italic>gyrA</italic> housekeeping gene as an internal control. All isolates were positive for 
 <italic>hyl</italic>, 
 <italic>cylE, scpB,</italic> and 
 <italic>lmb</italic> mRNA expressions, resulting in expected DNA fragments of 950, 248, 255, and 397-bp, respectively, whereas the 
 <italic>sip</italic> and 
 <italic>rip</italic> genes were not expressed in any isolate. The expression levels (as relative units) of 
 <italic>hyl</italic> (1.10–1.37), 
 <italic>cylE</italic> (0.97–1.13), 
 <italic>scpB</italic> (1.04–1.44), and 
 <italic>lmb</italic> (1.42–1.81) virulence genes are demonstrated in Table
