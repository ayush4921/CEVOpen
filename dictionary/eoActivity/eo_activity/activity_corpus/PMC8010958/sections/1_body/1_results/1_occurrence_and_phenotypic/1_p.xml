<p id="Par26">Overall, 146 out of 200 (73%) milk samples each corresponded to a single quarter of an individual clinically mastitic dairy cow originated from eight dairy herds across different Governorates in Egypt were found to be infected with 
 <italic>Streptococci</italic> species. Of these, 14 (9.59%) isolates were identified as 
 <italic>S. agalactiae.</italic> Typical 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> isolates appeared as colorless dewdrop like colonies with a bluish hue and surrounded by a complete zone of hemolysis on Edwardâ€™s media. Criteria such as negative reactions with the catalase and bile esculin tests, positive reactions with Christie, Atkins, Munch-Petersen (CAMP) and hippurate hydrolysis tests, resistance to bacitracin, and belonging to the Lancefield group B, have presumptively identified 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> isolates.
