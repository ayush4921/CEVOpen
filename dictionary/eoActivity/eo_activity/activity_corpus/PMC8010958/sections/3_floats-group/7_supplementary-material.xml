    <bold>Additional file 1. </bold>Scanning electron micrographs of 
    <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> biofilms on the 96-well microtitre plate after exposure to the MBIC
    <sub>50</sub> of the antimicrobial compounds. A) Untreated 
    <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> biofilm producer, B) cells treated with cinnamon oil (2 μg/mL), C) cells treated with silver nanoparticles (32 μg/mL), D) cells treated with cinnamon oil silver nanoparticles combination (1/2 μg/mL). The biofilm appears as electron-dense materials around bacterial cells. Treatment of biofilm-producing isolates with B, C, or D resulted in the detachment of the biofilms with various degrees. The magnification power is 2500x; scale bars = 10 nm.
