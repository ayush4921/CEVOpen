  <p>Killing kinetics of the MIC levels of cinnamon oil, silver nanoparticles, and their combination on the viability of 
   <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> isolates (time-kill curve). Bacterial survival was reported at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 h incubation time points by the colony forming unit (CFU) assay. The data are expressed as the means ± SE of three separate experiments, each containing three replicates
