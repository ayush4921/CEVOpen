    "The Covid-19 pandemic is a major catastrophe in recent times that has taken a toll over the global scale in terms of the casualties, economic impact, and human beings' lifestyle. Scientists and researchers worldwide are dedicated to counter this issue using large-scale drug discovery and analysis to explore both the vaccination and the cure for Covid-19. However, almost all of the tested medicinal options cover allopathic medicines. A major issue associated with the above approach is the side effects that present a lacuna in arriving at an agreeable solution. To date, there are a total of >150,000,000 Covid-19 cases have been reported. However, to date, there is no report available on the scope and application of natural medicines in the treatment of the Covid-19. This review aims to target this area while covering the economic and other impacts of the Covid-19 on human life, the significance of greener solutions in countering drug development, and the possible solutions of the Covid-19 using herbal drug treatment."
