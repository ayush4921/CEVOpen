<p>The MICs of AW against the standard and clinical species of 
 <italic>Candida</italic> were determined by the broth micro dilution method as recommended by the clinical and laboratory standards institute, with some modifications [ 
 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> ]. The serial dilutions of AW (1/2 to 1/1024 V/V) were prepared in 96-well microtiter trays using RPMI- 1640 (Sigma, St. Louis, USA) buffered with 3- morpholinopropane-1-sulfonic acid (MOPS) (Sigma, St. Louis, USA). The growth in each well was compared with that of the control well. The MICs were visually determined and defined as the lowest concentration of AW that produced no visible growth. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. In addition, the minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) of the examined AW was determined by culturing 10 ÂµL from the wells, showing no visible growth, onto Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) plates. The MFCs were determined as the lowest concentration yielding no more than four colonies, which yielded a yeast mortality of about 98% in the initial inoculums.
