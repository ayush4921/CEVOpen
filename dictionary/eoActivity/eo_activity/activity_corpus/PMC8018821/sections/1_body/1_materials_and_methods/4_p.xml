<p>The aerial parts of the plant (10 kg of plant material with 30 liters of water) were hydrodistillated, by means of an industrial apparatus from the Nab Factory (Meymand, Iran). This method is an old and feasible technique for the distillation of EO and preparation of edible AW in Iran and some other countries. Briefly, plant material was submerged in water, and the mixture was heated for 6 h to produce steam carrying the most volatile chemicals. The steam was then cooled down to collect the AW containing distilled compounds.</p>
