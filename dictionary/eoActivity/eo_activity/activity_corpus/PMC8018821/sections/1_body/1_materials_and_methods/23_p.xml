<p>After euthanizing and sacrificing the animals, tissue specimens were withdrawn from the digestive system, including the stomach and intestine, and transferred into 10% buffered formalin for further fixation. The samples underwent routine tissue processing while a 5- ùúám-thick tissue section was prepared and stained. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;amp;E), periodic acid-Schiff, and Gomori methenamine silver were used for staining. The samples were visualized under a light microscope (Olympus BX61) equipped with DP-73 camera. The presence or absence of fungal elements and any inflammatory process were also assessed.</p>
