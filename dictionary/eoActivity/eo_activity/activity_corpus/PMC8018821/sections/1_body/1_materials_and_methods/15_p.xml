<p>A semi-quantitative measure of biofilm formation was assayed using a 2, 3-bis (2-methoxy-4-nitro-5- sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carbox-anilide (XTT) reduction assay. The XTT (Sigma, USA) was prepared as a saturated solution at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL in Ringer's lactate. Prior to each assay, an aliquot of XTT stock solution was thawed and treated with menadione sodium bisulfate (10 mM prepared in Distilled Water; Sigma, USA) to obtain a final concentration of 1 µM menadione. A 100-µL aliquot of XTT-menadione was then added to each pre-washed well. Subsequently, the plates were incubated in dark for 2 h at 37°C, and the colorimetric change at 490 nm (a reflection of the metabolic activity of the biofilm) was measured with a microplate reader (POLAR star Omega, BMG Labtech, Germany) [
