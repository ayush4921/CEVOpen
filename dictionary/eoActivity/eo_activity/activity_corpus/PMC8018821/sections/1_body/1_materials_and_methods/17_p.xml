<p>The free radical-scavenging activity of EPs was determined by the DPPH assay as described previously [ 
 <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> , 
 <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> ]. Briefly, 270 µL of the different dilutions of EO was mixed with a methanolic solution of DPPH (100 µM) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The absorbance of the samples was measured at 517 nm by a spectrophotometric method. The IC50 values were calculated by the Curve-Expert software (for Windows, version 1.34). In addition, the AW percentage of inhibition was determined.
