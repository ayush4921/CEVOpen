<p>In this study, 27 female mice (BALB/c) with the age of 4 weeks and an approximate weight of 19-23 g were obtained from the Laboratory Animal Center of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran. The mice were kept at 25-30ÂºC and fed normal diet. To investigate the effect of 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> AW on alimentary candidiasis, 27 infected mice were randomly allocated into three treatment groups at separate cages, including test group (n=9) that received T. ammi AW instead of drinking water, positive control group (n=9) administered with 1 g/ml fluconazole in drinking water, and negative control group (n=9) that remained untreated and received only drinking water. As the healthy mice were resistant to colonization by yeast (
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>), antibiotic and immunosuppressive drugs were administrated prior to inoculation.
