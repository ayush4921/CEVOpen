<p>For this purpose, 3 days before the insemination of the yeast cell suspension, the mice were treated with an antibiotic (1 g/L tetracycline, 0.1 g/L gentamicin, and 2 g/L streptomycin). In the next step, 100 ml of yeast cell suspension at a concentration of 2×108 cells was intragastrically inoculated into the stomach of each mouse by the gavage feeding needle. Immediately following yeast gavage, the mice were injected with cyclophosphamide (100 mg/kg) intraperitoneally. The injections were repeated 1 week prior to sacrifice [

Three mice from each group were euthanized by injectable anesthetic overdose (3x anesthesia dose; 80-100/10 mg/kg) of ketamine /xylazine (intraperitoneally) at the end of the 3rd, 4th, and 5th weeks of fungal challenges. The stomach was removed, and a part of the stomach specimen was placed in formalin for histological studies. The other part was weighed under sterile conditions and homogenized in the tube containing sterile PBS (500 mg/ml) with a homogenizer (SpeedMill plus-Analytik Jena, Germany). The homogenized specimens were immediately cultured onto SDA (Merck, Germany) plates. Following 24-48h of incubation at 32°C, CFUs/500 mg was determined. The number of colonies in each group was counted and compared.
