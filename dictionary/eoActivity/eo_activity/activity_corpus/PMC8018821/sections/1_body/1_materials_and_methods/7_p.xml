<p>The compounds of EO were identified by comparing retention indices with those reported in the literature, mass spectra with the Wiley library, and published mass spectra data. The retention indices were determined using the retention times of n-alkanes that were injected after EO administration under the same chromatographic conditions. The retention indices for all components were determined according to the Van Den Dool method using n-alkanes (C8 to C26) as standard. Relative percentage amounts were calculated from the total area under the peaks by the apparatus software.</p>
