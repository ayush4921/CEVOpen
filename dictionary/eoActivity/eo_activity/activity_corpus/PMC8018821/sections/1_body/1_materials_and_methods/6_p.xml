<p>To extract EO from AW, 300 ml of the AW was transferred into a decanter, and active compounds were extracted by a solvent (300 ml of diethyl ether, 3 times). The solvent was removed by an evaporator. Finally, EO was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The analysis of EO was performed using an Agilent gas chromatograph series 7890A coupled with 7000 Triple Quad mass spectrometer. A fused silica capillary DB- 1MS column (30 m, 0.25-mm inside diameter; 0.25 µm film thickness) was used for the separation of the different compounds of EO. The injector and auxiliary temperature were kept at 250℃ and 280℃, respectively. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min. The oven temperature was programmed to increase from 60℃ to 280℃ at a rate of 4℃/min and kept at this temperature for 4 min. The split ratio was 1:30, and the mass spectra were recorded over a range of 46-650 amu, with an ionizing voltage of 70 eV.</p>
