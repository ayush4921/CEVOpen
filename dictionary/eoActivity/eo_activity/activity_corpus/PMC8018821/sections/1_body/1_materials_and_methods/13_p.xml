<p>Following a study performed by Ramage et al. [ 
 <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> ], 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> (CBS1905) was cultured and maintained on SDA (Merck, Germany) plate. After 48 h, one loop of colonies was transferred to 20 mL Sabouraud dextrose broth (Merck, Germany) and incubated overnight in an orbital shaker incubator (Jal-Tajhiz, Iran) (100 rpm) at 30ºC under aerobic condition. Yeast cells were harvested and washed twice in sterile phosphate- buffered saline (PBS). Then, they were resuspended in RPMI 1640 supplemented with L-glutamine (Gibco) and buffered with MOPS. Subsequently, the cell densities were adjusted to 1.0×106 cells/ml after counting with a hematocytometer. Serial dilution of AW (1/2 - 1/1024 V/V) in RPMI 1640 was prepared in presterilized, polystyrene, flat-bottom, 96-well microtiter plates (SPL Life Sciences, Korea). After the addition of 0.1 ml of the yeast inoculums to the wells, the tray was incubated at 30ºC for 24-48 h in a humid atmosphere. In the next stage, 200 μl of the un- inoculated medium was included as a negative control (blank). In addition, RPMI with yeasts but without AW was served as the positive control.
