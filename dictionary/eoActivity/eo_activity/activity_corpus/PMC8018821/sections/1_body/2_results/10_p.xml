<p>The numbers of colony-forming units (CFUs) in the mice treated with AW and the controls are shown in 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. The mean CFUs obtained from the cultured samples of control and AW groups were 543.5±192.10 and 41.4±18.93, respectively. As expected, no fungal growth was found in the culture of fluconazole-treated mice. The results of the independent sample t-test showed a statistically significant difference between the control and AW groups (
 <italic>P</italic>=0.02). By splitting the groups based on the sampling time, a significant difference was noted between the control and AW groups in the 5th week. The results are listed in 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. These data indicated that the mean CFUs were significantly lower in the AW group in comparison to that in the control group.
