<p>The antioxidant activities of the AW of 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> and its extracted EO were evaluated by DPPH assay. In this method, DPPH is neutralized by receiving an electron or a hydrogen atom from an antioxidant compound. Based on the results, the EO extracted from 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> AW showed a considerable antioxidant activity (IC50=69.8±0.8 µg/ml). Similarly, the AW of 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> revealed a slight antioxidant activity and neutralized DPPH up to 17% (16.92±2.65) at a concentration of 200 mg. Quercetin was used as a standard antioxidant control with an IC50 value of 9.1±0.42 µg/ml.
