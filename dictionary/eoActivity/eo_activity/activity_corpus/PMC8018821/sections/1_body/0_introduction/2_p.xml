<p>Gastritis caused by 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species colonization is another phenomenon that happens in the acidic pH of the gut of individuals taking anti-acid drugs, such as H2 blockers. These commensal yeasts residing in the GI tract have been reported to run away from their niche to the bloodstream and cause invasive candidiasis. In this regard, Miranda et al. reported identical strains of 
 <italic>Candida</italic> isolated from both the blood and rectal culture of patients [ 
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> ]. Moreover, it has been estimated that about one-third of patients with fulminant hepatic failure may develop fungal infections, with 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> being the most frequent agent [ 
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> ]. The treatments of choice for GI candidiasis are azole and polyene antifungals. However, as a result of the recent emergence of resistance to these routine antifungal drugs among 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species [ 
 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> ], the management and treatment of this infection are still considered a universal crisis. A strategy to overcome this problem is the use of novel antimicrobial agents, especially from natural resources.
