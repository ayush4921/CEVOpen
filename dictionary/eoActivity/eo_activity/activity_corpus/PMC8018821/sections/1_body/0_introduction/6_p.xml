<p>In previous studies [ 
 <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> - 
 <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> ], the EO distilled from 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> revealed considerable antifungal activities. Regarding such activity and a global tendency toward using natural products and phytochemicals, the present study was conducted to evaluate the chemical composition, as well as the antioxidant and antifungal activities of 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> AW against 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species. Moreover, the in vivo efficacy of AW in the prevention and treatment of GI candidiasis was assessed experimentally in the mice infected with 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>.
