<p>The considerable antifungal activity of AW observed by the elimination of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> in the affected tissue might be related to the presence of phenolic monoterpenes in the EO of AW. The antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of AW resulted in considerable effects by reducing inflammation and starting the healing process in the necrotic tissue. These findings can be added to the literature on the treatment of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection when herbals can be a therapeutic choice to enhance common treatments.
