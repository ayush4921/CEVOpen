<p>The chemical compositions of 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> EOs from different studies are shown in 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. Based on the results, the majority of the studies identified thymol as the main compound of 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> EO at the concentration of 36.4-72.3%. According to the GC-MS analysis, the concentration of thymol (78.08%) in the EO extracted from AW was higher than those of the previous reports [
