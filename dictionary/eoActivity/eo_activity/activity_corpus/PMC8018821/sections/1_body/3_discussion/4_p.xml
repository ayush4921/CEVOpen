<p>Furthermore, it has been shown that the chemical compositions of AW and EO are different both qualitatively and quantitatively [ 
 <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> , 
 <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> ]. The difference between the EO composition of AW in our study and those of some previous reports may be due to variation in the boiling points of these compounds. As shown in Table 5, γ- terpinene and p-cymene, as major compounds reported in most studies, are not detected in this study. Such a discrepancy might be due to the low boiling point of these two compounds (173℃ and 177℃, respectively) in comparison to those of thymol and carvacrol (232℃ and 237℃, respectively), and that they might be evaporated much earlier during the hydrodistillation and extraction processing.
