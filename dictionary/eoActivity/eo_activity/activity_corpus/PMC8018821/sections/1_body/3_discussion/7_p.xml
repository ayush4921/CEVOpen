<p>The EO of 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> AW was found to be rich in phenolic monoterpenes. These monoterpenes exhibit their antibacterial activities through the perturbation of the cytoplasmic membrane, resulting in the alteration of membrane permeability and leakage of ions and intracellular materials [
