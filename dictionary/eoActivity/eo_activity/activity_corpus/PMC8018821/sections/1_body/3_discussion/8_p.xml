<p>The culture of the stomach of the infected mice and controls indicated that gastric Candidal colonization significantly decreased or even eliminated (in one case) in those receiving the AW of 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> (for 5 weeks), and this AW had a therapeutic effect on Candidal colonization. Our findings are well correlated with the results of histopathological analyses. The results showed that Candidal colonization declined in the mice following the administration of 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> AW in therapeutic trials.
