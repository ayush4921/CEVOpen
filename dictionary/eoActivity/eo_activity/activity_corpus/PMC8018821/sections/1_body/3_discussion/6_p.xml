<p>Moreover, we have shown that the biofilm formation of 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species was inhibited by the EO of 
 <italic>Mentha piperita</italic> at a concentration of up to 2 Î¼l/ml [ 
 <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> ]. In this study, AW inhibited the formation of 
 <italic>Candida</italic> biofilm by about 50% at a concentration of 0.062 V/V. Concerning the very low concentrations of active compounds (i.e., %EO) in the AW, we can conclude that the AW has a high potential to inhibit the formation of biofilm.
