<p>Meanwhile, Hassan et al. [ 
 <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> ] did not find thymol in the EO of 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> and identified p-cymene (38%) as the major constituent of EO. After thymol, phenolic monoterpenes, including carvacrol and carvotanacetone, were found as the most frequent compounds of the EO of AW, while others reported a relatively low amount for these two compounds (up to 0.74%) in EO. Conversely, cymene and Î³-terpinene were two dominant compounds of EOs in the majority of previous reports [ 
 <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> ], which were not found in our study. The differences in the chemical composition obtained in our study and those reported by others might be due to the differences in the climate, geographical location, or developmental stage of the cultivated plant.
