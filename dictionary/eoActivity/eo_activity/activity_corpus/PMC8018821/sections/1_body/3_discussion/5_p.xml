<p>We have previously reported considerable antifungal and antibacterial activities for 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> EO in vitro [ 
 <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> , 
 <xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> ]. In this study, the AW exhibited fungistatic and fungicidal activities against all tested 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species at concentrations ranging from 0.125 V/V to 0.5 V/V. The higher MICs and MFCs of the AW in this study, compared to those of EOs, may be due to the very low amount of EO in AW [ 
 <xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> , 
 <xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> ]. However, if the dilution factor (yield) of the EO in AW is included (i.e.,0.028%), the inhibitory effect would be comparable or even much better than those of previous reports [ 
 <xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> ]. Since the AW of 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> exhibited inhibitory and cidal activities against fluconazole-resistant 
 <italic>Candida</italic> strains, it can be concluded that the mechanism of action of 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> AW is different from that of fluconazole.
