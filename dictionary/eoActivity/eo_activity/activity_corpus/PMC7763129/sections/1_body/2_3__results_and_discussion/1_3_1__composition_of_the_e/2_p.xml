<p>The dominant compounds of both oils showed similarities, since both were from different parts of the same plant. However, they had also several uncommon compounds. It has also been reported that the chemical constituents of EOs differ in each species or subspecies [18]. As clearly shown in Table 1, both the stem bark and root oils were dominated mostly by oxygen-containing monoterpene compounds (71.82% and 77.51%), the major ones being phenolic ether thymyl derivatives 2,5-dimethoxy- 
 <italic>p</italic> -cymene and thymol methyl ether (total 66.79% and 73.69%), respectively. Oxygenated sesquiterpenes (10.28%), of which humulene epoxide II (5.96%) also occurred in a substantial amount, were detected in the stem bark oil. Sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, such as α-humulene (2.34%), 
 <italic>β</italic> -caryophyllene (1.17%), and germacrene D (0.96%), constituted about 4.47% of the oil that were identified in the root EO, of which the last 2 volatile compounds were absent in the stem bark EO. Relatively high concentrations of fatty acids (5.32%), of which 5.18% was palmitic acid, were also observed as constituents in the root oil. However, monoterpene hydrocarbon compounds were not detected in the 2 oils, as it may have been oxidized to form the dominant oxygenated monoterpenes.
