<p>These results were the first antibacterial activity results for 
 <italic>L. tomentosa</italic> EOs. From the overall results, it can be concluded that if the concentration of these oils increases, their inhibitory effect against the bacteria will also increase. The high activity of the oils of 
 <italic>L. tomentosa</italic> (especially the stem bark oil) against the gram+ ( 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> ) bacteria was most likely due to the chemical compounds having antibacterial properties in them. EOs that contain 2,5-dimethoxy- 
 <italic>p</italic> -cymene as a major component of the oil have been reported to have antibacterial properties [33]. Therefore, the bactericidal activity of the 
 <italic>L. tomentosa</italic> oils may have mainly been related to this compound. Thymol methyl ether, which represented 9.51% and 8.93%, respectively, of the oils of the stem bark and roots of 
 <italic>L. tomentosa</italic> , and a major constituent of the stem bark oil, humulene epoxide II (5.96%), may also have had a significant contribution to the antibacterial activity of the oils. Other compounds, including terpineol, δ-cadinene, α-humulene, caryophyllene oxide, eugenol, thymol, carvacrol, linalool, and geraniol, which were also present in the oils, have been reported to have antibacterial activities [29,31,34–36], and may also have collectively had a remarkable contribution to the bactericidal activities of the oils. According to a literature survey, a detailed list of the in vitro bactericidal activities against a broad set of gram+ and gram– bacteria for different EOs of plants of the genus 
 <italic>Laggera</italic> was reported [2,3,32]. The antibacterial activity results of the oils of these plants, and those obtained in the current study, showed variations that may have been due to factors such as the composition and concentration of the EOs, and the type and concentration of the target organisms [37,38], in addition to the factors stated earlier in Section 3.1. However, among the investigated oils of these plants, the EO of 
 <italic>L. decurrens</italic> , which has high 3-methoxythymoquinone (28.1%) content, showed the highest antibacterial activity (MIC = 0.13 mg/mL) against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> [32]. The EO of 
 <italic>L. pterodonta</italic> , which has high 2,5-dimethoxy- 
 <italic>p</italic> -cymene (36.75%) content, displayed moderate activity against some gram– bacteria, such as 
 <italic>Enterobacter aerogenes</italic> (MIC = 0.125 mg/mL), 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> (MIC = 0.5 mg/mL), 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (MIC = 0.25 mg/mL), 
 <italic>Salmonella typhi</italic> (MIC = 0.5 mg/mL), and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (MIC = 0.5 mg/mL) [23]. The EO of 
 <italic>L. crispata</italic> , which has a major compound of 2,5-dimethoxy- 
 <italic>p</italic> -cymene (43.2%), also demonstrated moderate antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> (ZI = 6 mm) and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (ZI = 8 mm), but no activity against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> [26].
