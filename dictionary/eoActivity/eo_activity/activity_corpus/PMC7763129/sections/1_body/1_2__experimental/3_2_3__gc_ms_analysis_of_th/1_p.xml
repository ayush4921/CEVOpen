<p>Samples of each of the EOs, extracted as described above, were diluted in n-hexane (1:10) and analyzed using GC-MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA), which was equipped with a DB-5 (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25-µm film thickness) capillary separation column. GC/MS operating conditions comprised the following: oven temperature, from 50 to 250 °C, at increments of 5 °C/min, and held for 5 min; injector temperature, 220 °C ; transfer line, 250 °C; carrier gas, He at 1.0 mL/min constant flow rate; injection volume of the sample, 1 µL; split ratio, 1:20. Ionization of the components of the EO samples was performed in electron impact (70 eV) mode, at an m/z range of 40–450. The identity of the components of the EOs was achieved by visual interpretation and comparing their retention indices (RIs) relative to the n-alkanes of the C7–C30 and mass (m/z) spectra with those from the literature [11–13], and NIST and Wiley libraries.</p>
