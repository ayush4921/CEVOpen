<p>Disc diffusion analysis was performed to assess the antibacterial activity of the oils against 2 gram+ ( 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC 25923 and 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> ATCC 10876) and 2 gram– ( 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> ATCC 70063 and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ATCC 25922) bacteria at different (0.10, 0.25, and 0.50 mg/mL) concentrations using the method described by Luo et al. [13], with slight modifications. For this method, 6-mm-diameter sterilized Whatman No. 1 filter paper disks were saturated with different concentrations of the EOs of the stem bark and roots of 
 <italic>L. tomentosa</italic> , and placed on nutrient agar plates. The plates were preinoculated with each of the test bacterial strains in suspension (108 CFU/mL) of bacteria and then incubated for about 24 h at 37 °C. After incubation, the diameters of their inhibition zones (DIZs) were measured in millimeters. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was assessed using the broth dilution method [16], with some modifications. The EOs were dissolved in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide and added to Mueller Hinton broth for the growth of the bacteria. All of the test samples were prepared with the final (10 to 0.015 mg/mL) concentrations and distributed in 96-well microplates. In each test, the bacterial inocula were added into each of the growth control wells. The MIC of each of the samples was then recorded as the lowest concentration of the EOs that inhibited bacterial growth, after incubation for 18–24 h at 37 °C. The antibiotic gentamicin was used as a control (positive) against the selected bacterial strains.
