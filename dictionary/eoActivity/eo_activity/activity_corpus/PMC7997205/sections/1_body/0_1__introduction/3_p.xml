 <xref rid="B12-nutrients-13-00798" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In the cardiovascular system, preclinical studies of our group showed that coconut oil supplementation, alone or combined with exercise training, was able to induce antihypertensive response in spontaneously hypertensive rats [

In addition, it was shown that this effect was associated with an improvement in baroreflex response and attenuation of oxidative stress. Subsequently, it was found that lauric acid, the main fatty acid isolated from coconut oil, was able to induce a dose-dependent reduction in blood pressure (BP), as well as to promote vasorelaxation of isolated rat superior mesenteric artery [
