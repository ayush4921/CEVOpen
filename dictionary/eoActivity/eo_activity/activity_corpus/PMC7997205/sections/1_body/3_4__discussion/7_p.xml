 <xref rid="B48-nutrients-13-00798" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] analyses were conducted to estimate the serum oxidative stress of hypertensive patients. This effect was evaluated by comparing the serum concentrations of MDA, a byproduct of lipid peroxidation, in different experimental conditions. As previously mentioned, this interaction between oxidative stress and damage to the autonomic function is well documented [

 <xref rid="B50-nutrients-13-00798" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and increase in the variability has been linked to alterations in autonomic function, including sympathetic hyperactivity [
 <xref rid="B51-nutrients-13-00798" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Following the findings of ineffectiveness obtained on the cardiovascular variables of blood pressure and blood pressure variability, it was found that nutritional supplementation with EVCO was not able to interfere with the oxidative stress accessed through the MDA. Only an isolated effect of the interaction was seen in the group supplemented with EVCO which also participated in the physical training program. Although this effect reproduces, at least in part, the possible amplifying response of EVCO combined with exercise training, it was obtained in a group that started from a higher baseline value of MDA.
