<p>Clinical studies with specific subpopulations and testing non-pharmacological alternatives are essential. Thus, considering the preliminary research, this was the first trial designed to assess the effects of EVCO in patients with systemic arterial hypertension. So, this study represents an effort to test an unknown outcome on the use of coconut oil in humans. In addition, we highlight the fact that the present study controlled precisely (through supplementation with capsules) the amount of EVCO effectively ingested. An important proportion of the studies that focus on this natural product did not properly control the amount of EVCO ingested; instead, it was included in meal preparation, without precise delimitations of its consumption [

This is relevant because several studies have compared the use of coconut oil with other vegetable oils, which sometimes also have biological effects, causing complications in the interpretation of the results obtained [
