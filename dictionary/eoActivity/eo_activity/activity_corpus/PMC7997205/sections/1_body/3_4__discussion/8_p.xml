<p>In fact, the effectiveness of this antioxidant property inherent to EVCO has been attributed almost exclusively to animal models. Nevin and Ramajohan [
 <xref rid="B9-nutrients-13-00798" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] showed that virgin coconut oil was related to an increase in the activity of the enzymes glutathione peroxidase, catalase and superoxide dismutase in organs such as liver, heart and kidneys. Famurewa et al. [
 <xref rid="B8-nutrients-13-00798" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] demonstrated that this increase in the activity of hepatic catalase and superoxide dismutase (but not GPx) occurred in a concentration dependent on EVCO and that they were related to a decrease in MDA. This response was also observed in homogenate of rat heart muscle [

 <xref rid="B52-nutrients-13-00798" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], for example, found no significant differences between individuals treated with coconut or sunflower oil in relation to oxidative stress. Additionally, the results indicated that physical exercise was not able to promote significant changes in oxidative stress after 30 days. It seems that this relationship between exercise and oxidative stress is complicated and can be modulated in several levels of intensity, type and duration of training [

Regarding other possible sources of exogenous antioxidants offered by the diet during the experimental period that could eventually have interfered with the responses discussed in this study, it should be noted that the nutritional follow-up implemented represented an additional factor to reinforce the evidence presented.
