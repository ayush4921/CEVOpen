<p>Regarding the primarily investigated outcome, there was no antihypertensive effect associated with supplementation with EVCO in patients with stage 1 arterial hypertension tested in this study, unlike what was evidenced in the preclinical study with an animal model of essential hypertension [

Clinically, it should be noted that the diagnostic parameter used in this study was consistent, since a 24-hour blood pressure monitoring technique was used. The ABPM is fundamental in the evaluation of the efficacy of antihypertensive drugs in clinical trials and, consequently, very useful in the clinical management of hypertension [

 <xref rid="B30-nutrients-13-00798" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], as it eliminates stress-induced momentary hypertension, called white coat hypertension. Sometimes, an isolated outpatient measure may not reflect the patientâ€™s real blood pressure [
 <xref rid="B31-nutrients-13-00798" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In some cases, a sympathetic discharge associated with the situation of being evaluated by a cardiologist is sufficient to induce a pressure response [
 <xref rid="B32-nutrients-13-00798" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This evidence reinforces caution in issuing false-positive results. Finally, this monitoring reflects the pressure behavior during the entire 24 h period. On average, approximately 70 (seventy) blood pressure measurements are performed, without interference from the human factor during the checks, minimizing the measurement bias.
