<p>Although no effect on blood pressure was observed, a possible effect of EVCO on the autonomic function of patients was investigated. Two main factors motivated this experimental approach. First, in the pre-clinical study it was seen that, besides the antihypertensive activity, the supplementation with EVCO was associated with a reduction in oxidative stress and with an improvement in the baroreflex response in the treated animals [

This alternative constitutes a non-invasive tool capable of providing parameters related to autonomic activity based on blood pressure oscillations over time [
