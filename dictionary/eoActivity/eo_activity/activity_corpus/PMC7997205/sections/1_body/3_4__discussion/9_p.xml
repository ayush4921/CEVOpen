<p>In conclusion, the supplementation with EVCO did not have an antihypertensive effect in patients with stage 1 hypertension. It also showed no effectiveness on blood pressure variability and oxidative stress levels in humans. Thus, although coconut oil supplementation (10 mL/day) was shown to be safe as a nutritional approach and without significant impacts on the caloric load intake, it was not able to reproduce the effects obtained in an experimental model of hypertension when translated to hypertensive patients. Finally, it should be ratified that complementary studies are necessary to determine if doses different from the current trial can evoke additional or diverse effects.</p>
