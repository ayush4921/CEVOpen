<p>Blood pressure variability is not a physiological variable routinely accessed in clinical practice, although according to Hsu et al. [
 <xref rid="B39-nutrients-13-00798" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], it is recognized as a prognostic factor independent of blood pressure level [
 <xref rid="B24-nutrients-13-00798" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Evidence shows that the adverse cardiovascular consequences of high blood pressure may be the result of increased variability and not high blood pressure alone [

 <xref rid="B41-nutrients-13-00798" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In addition, there is a strong association between increased BP variability and subclinical progression of target organ damage [
 <xref rid="B42-nutrients-13-00798" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Two indexes of BP variability were used, the standard deviation and the average real variability. They are not redundant analyses, because according to Mena [
 <xref rid="B24-nutrients-13-00798" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], ARV offers an additional reinforcement in the variability representation. Our results indicated no effect of ECVO supplementation on the variability indices evaluated. Furthermore, no effect interaction between the groups was observed, although a moderate effect size persists considering the average real variability. The analysis indicates that physical training did not prove to be determinant for this response. Although aerobic exercise is a useful complement to control hypertension, it does not necessarily affect blood pressure variability [
 <xref rid="B43-nutrients-13-00798" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In addition, the most effective training protocols for lowering blood pressure levels are longer (minimum 8â€“12 weeks) [
 <xref rid="B44-nutrients-13-00798" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The associative effect, i.e., the potentiating effect promoted by the supplementation with EVCO in combination with training, seen in the pre-clinical study [
 <xref rid="B13-nutrients-13-00798" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], has not been fully reproduced in humans.
