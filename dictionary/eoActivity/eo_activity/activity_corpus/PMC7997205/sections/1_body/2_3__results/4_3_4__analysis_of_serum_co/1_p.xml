<p>There is no EVCO-induced effect on serum MDA concentrations (nmol/mL) assessed after the experimental intervention compared to control intervention (EVCO (2.22 ± 0.10 vs. 2.24 ± 0.13); Placebo (2.27 ± 0.11 vs. 2.32 ± 0.15); EVCO 
 <italic>plus</italic> training (2. 63 ± 0.10 vs. 2.20 ± 0.14); and Placebo 
 <italic>plus</italic> training (2.21 ± 0.12 vs. 2.29 ± 0.17); 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.644 and 
 <italic>η</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.009). However, there is an interaction effect between time and group that appears to be promoted as a function of a decrease between initial and final MDA concentrations among patients who were supplemented with EVCO and trained (

 <italic>η</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.227) (
