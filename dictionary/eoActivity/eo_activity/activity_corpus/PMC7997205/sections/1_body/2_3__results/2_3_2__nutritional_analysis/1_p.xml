<p>The records obtained from the food diaries of the patients supplemented with coconut oil or placebo indicates that there was no difference in the energy intake (1961 (1700–2222) vs. 1678 (1450–1905) kcal; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.134), carbohydrate intake (252.8 (200.1–305.5) vs. 213.2 (177.9–248.4) g; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.278) and total fats intake (69.1 (56.7–81.5) vs. 55.7 (40.5–70.8) g; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.161). However, considering the fractions of saturated fats (29.3 (23.5–35.1) vs. 18.5 (12.0–24.8) g; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.017) and the amount of lauric acid (4.64 (4.50–4.77) vs. 0.20 (0.07–0.34) g; 
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) ingested in periods of coconut oil and placebo supplementation, respectively, a greater amount of saturated fats and lauric acid is observed for patients supplemented with coconut oil. For the other dietary constituents evaluated (proteins, cholesterol, linolenic acid, trans fats, sodium, zinc, vitamins B12, B9, A, C, E and β-carotene) there was no significant difference between the periods of supplementation with EVCO and placebo (data not shown). In addition, no adverse effects (diarrhea, constipation, nausea, colic, migraine, among others) were observed or reported in relation to the use of 10 mL/day of EVCO during the 30-day period, suggesting that this pattern of dietary supplementation is fully safe in humans.
