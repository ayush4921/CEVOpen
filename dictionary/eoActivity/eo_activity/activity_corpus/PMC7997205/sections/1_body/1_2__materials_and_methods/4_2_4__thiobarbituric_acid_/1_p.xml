<p>To evaluate lipid peroxidation, serum samples were collected to measure levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) determined by TBARS assay [
 <xref rid="B22-nutrients-13-00798" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. After blood collections, the samples were centrifuged at 5000× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min to obtain serum. Then, 250 µL of serum were stored at 37 °C for 1 h, after which 400 µL of 35% perchloric acid was added, and the mixture was centrifuged (14,000× 
 <italic>g</italic>/4 °C) for 20 min. Four hundred and fifty microliters of supernatant was removed and mixed with 0.6% thiobarbituric acid and incubated at 90 °C for 1 h. Then, absorbance at 532 nm was measured. A standard curve was generated using 1,1,3,3-tetrametoxypropane. Results were expressed as nmol/mL.
