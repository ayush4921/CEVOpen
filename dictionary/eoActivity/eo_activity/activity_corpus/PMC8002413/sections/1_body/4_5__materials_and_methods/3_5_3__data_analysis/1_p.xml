<p>Based on the results obtained, I set up a checklist including taxon, family, vernacular names, plant part(s) used, Italian regions for which the use of the species is reported, bibliographic citations, and therapeutic uses. The nomenclature follows the Plant List Database [
 <xref rid="B99-plants-10-00563" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Families are organized according to APG IV [
 <xref rid="B100-plants-10-00563" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>] for angiosperms. When helpful, due to the recent changes in nomenclature, synonyms are reported in parentheses.
