<p>In Italy, ethnobotanical surveys have received increasing attention in recent decades, seeking to investigate the traditional uses of plants and their products (e.g., [

 <xref rid="B19-plants-10-00563" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-plants-10-00563" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]). Some of these studies focus on wild edible plants (e.g., [

 <xref rid="B22-plants-10-00563" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]), while others infer the use of wild plants as food through more general studies of ethnobotany (e.g., [
 <xref rid="B23-plants-10-00563" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-plants-10-00563" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]). In this regard, the literature in Italy lacks the coverage of some major issues focusing on plants used as spices.
