<p>The team from São Paulo (Brazil) also investigated the antinociceptive properties of a hydroalcoholic extract prepared from the aerial parts of 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> using a mice model. Two tests were performed by the researchers: a hot plate test to measure the central analgesic effect and a writhing test to measure the peripheral analgesic effect. In the hot plate test, the control group was given only water, while the test group received 500 or 1000 mg/kg of 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> extract. Mice given 20 mg/kg BW morphine were adopted as the positive control. The response time (response latency) was determined after placing the rodents on a plate heated to 55 °C. The time taken by the mice to respond was not found to decrease after the administration of the 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> extract. In the writhing test, the mice were divided into groups and were given water, 20 g/kg BW morphine, and the hydroalcoholic extract of 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> at doses of 100, 250, 500, and 1000 mg/kg BW. After 30 min, the rodents were administered with a 0.8% acetic acid solution and writhing episodes were determined for the next 10 min. No decrease in the number of episodes was observed with the extract administered at the doses of 100 and 250 mg/kg BW; however, a decrease was observed with the higher doses of the extract (i.e., 500 and 1000 mg/kg BW). The results proved that the tested extracts of the 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> herb had a moderate peripheral antinociceptive effect but not a central effect [
