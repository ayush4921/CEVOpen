<p>Another team from the same center from Sri Lanka studied the ethanolic leaf extract of 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> for antiparasitic activity in 
 <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> ANKA murine malaria model that elicits similar pathogenesis as falciparum malaria. The extract at doses of 500, 750, and 1000 mg/kg significantly inhibited parasitemia by 79.3%, 79.6%, and 87.3% respectively, in the 4-day suppressive assay. Chronic administration of the extract at high dose ruled out the overt signs of toxicity and stress as well as hepatotoxicity, renotoxicity, and hematotoxicity. Therefore, the authors claimed that the oral administration of a crude extract of 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> is nontoxic and induces antimalarial (antiparasitic) effects [
