<p>In 2006, Blagojević et al. from Serbia and Montenegro also studied the effects of 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> essential oil on various microorganisms. The oil was isolated from the aerial and underground parts of the plant by steam distillation. After 10- and 30-fold dilutions, the zone of inhibition of pathogen growth on paper filters was examined. The oil extracted from the aerial parts exhibited inhibitory activity against various bacteria (
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Salmonella enteritidis</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>) and fungi (
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic>), which was attributed to its high levels of 1,8-cineole and β-thujone. On the other hand, the oil extracted from the underground parts of the plant exhibited only a low activity against the listed pathogens, due to the low level of 1,8-cineole and the lack of β-thujone in the roots [
