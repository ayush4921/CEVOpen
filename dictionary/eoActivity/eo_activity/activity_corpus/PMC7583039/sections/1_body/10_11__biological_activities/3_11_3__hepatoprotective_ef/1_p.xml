<p>In 2005, two teams from Pakistani universities in Karachi investigated the hepatoprotective properties of 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> herb extracts in in vivo studies on mice. They divided the test rodents into five groups and conducted an experiment. The first and second groups were administered with a saline solution; two hours later, the second group received an additional 700 mg/kg 
 <sc>d</sc>-galactosamine and 1 μg/kg lipopolysaccharide, which caused liver inflammation as confirmed by elevated levels of hepatic function indicators—alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and aspartate aminotransferase (ASPAT). The third, fourth, and fifth groups were given different, prophylactic, doses (from 150 to 600 mg/kg BW) of a crude hydromethanolic extract prepared from the aerial parts of 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic>, and an hour later, received 
 <sc>d</sc>-galactosamine and lipopolysaccharide. A significant reduction was noted in ASPAT and ALAT activities in plasma in all the three groups. The results observed in these groups were confirmed by a histopathological examination of the liver, which showed a decrease in cellular edema and apoptotic cell count, and no hyperemia of the hepatic parenchyma, relative to the second group [
