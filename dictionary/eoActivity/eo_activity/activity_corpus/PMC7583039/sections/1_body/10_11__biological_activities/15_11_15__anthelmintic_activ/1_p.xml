<p>Caner et al. from Turkey proved that the extracts of 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> and 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> induce anthelmintic effects against trichinellosis (
 <italic>Trichinella spiralis</italic>) in rats. The results of trichinoscopy and artificial digestion showed that during the enteral (adult) phase of the illness, 300 mg/kg of methanol extracts prepared from the aerial parts of 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> and 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> reduced the larval rate by 75.6% and 63.5% in the tongue, 53.4% and 37.7% in the diaphragm, 67.8% and 46.2% in the quadriceps, and 66.7% and 60.5% in the biceps–triceps muscles of rats, respectively. Furthermore, during the parenteral (encapsulated larvae) phase, 600 mg/kg dose of both the plant extracts decreased the larval rate by 66.4% and 59.9% in the tongue, 57.4% and 50.0% in the diaphragm, 47.6% and 43.7% in the quadriceps, and 60.2% and 46.4% in the biceps–triceps muscles of rats, respectively. In addition, antibody analysis showed that 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> extract can significantly reduce the antibody response [
