<p>Researchers from Romania investigated the antifungal activity of a commercial preparation of the essential oil extracted from the 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> herb against 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>. The disk-diffusion method was used in the in vitro experiment. The observed inhibition zone measured 12.5 mm. The zone of the positive control, carried out with nystatin, measured 15.0 mm, while that of the negative control, carried out with an empty paper disc, measured 6.0 mm. The results thus confirmed the antifungal activity of the essential oil of the herb against
