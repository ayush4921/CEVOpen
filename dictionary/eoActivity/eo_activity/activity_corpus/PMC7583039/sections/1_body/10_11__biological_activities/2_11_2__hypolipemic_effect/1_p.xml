<p>An extract obtained from the root of 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> was tested by a Hindu team. They analyzed the rats in which hyperlipidemia had been caused by the administration of a high-fat diet for a period of 30 days. In the following month, the rodents received a standard diet. The team found that the 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> root extract showed a significant lipid profile-normalizing activity. Total cholesterol (TC) was reduced to 180 mg/dL, triglycerides (TG) to 147.2 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol to 126.3 mg/dL, and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol to 28.2 mg/dL, while the level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and atherogenicity indicator (AI) increased to 68 and 2.63 mg/dL, respectively, compared to the control group (TC = 282.23 mg/dL, TG = 243.2 mg/dL, LDL cholesterol = 209.16 mg/dL, VLDL cholesterol = 47.56 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol = 34.17 mg/dL, and AI = 8.2 mg/dL) [
