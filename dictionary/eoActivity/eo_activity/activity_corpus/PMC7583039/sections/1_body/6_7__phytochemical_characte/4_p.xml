<p>Although the root of this species is sometimes used as raw material, only a few publications have described its chemical composition. A group of scientists from the University of Niš in Niš (Serbia and Montenegro) analyzed the differences in the phytochemical profile of the essential oil obtained from its green parts and root. The plant materials used in the study were collected during the flowering period. They were dried and then subjected to steam distillation in a Clevenger apparatus. The isolated compounds were identified using gas chromatography, gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, and 
 <sup>13</sup>C nuclear magnetic resonance. The main compounds in the oil extracted from the root were neryl 2-methylbutanoate (13.2%), β-eudesmol (10.4%), and bornyl 3-methylbutanoate (8.45%). However, none of these substances was found in the oil obtained from the aerial parts. The underground part of the plant also contained some rare compounds belonging to,
