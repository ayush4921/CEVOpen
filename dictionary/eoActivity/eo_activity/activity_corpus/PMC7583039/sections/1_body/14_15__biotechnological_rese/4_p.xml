<p>An effective protocol for the micropropagation of 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> was developed by scientists from Bharathidasan University in Tamil Nadu (India) in cooperation with Universita di Pisa in Pisa, (Italy). The method involved in vitro liquid culturing on MS medium with the addition of BAP at concentrations from 0.44 to 8.88 μM. In 100 mL flasks, the frequency of shoot formation from explants was determined to be 99.9% when the BAP concentration was 4.44 μM. The largest number of shoots (85.5) was obtained after 30 days of culture in 500 mL flasks, with 4.44 μM BAP. An increase in shoot proliferation with an increase in flask capacity and a decrease in proliferation were observed with an increase in the BAP concentration above 4.44 μM. In the next stage of work, individual shoots were isolated and rooted on MS medium with 8.56 μM IAA. The seedlings obtained were acclimatized under standard laboratory conditions. The plants thus grown were then transferred to the greenhouse [
