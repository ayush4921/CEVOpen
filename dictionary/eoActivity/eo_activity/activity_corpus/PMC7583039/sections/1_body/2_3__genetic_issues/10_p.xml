<p>According to Reference [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-25-04415" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], sequencing of nuclear and organelle genome regions, such as the external and internal transcribed spacers of nuclear ribosomal DNA and the intergenic spacers between the genes of chloroplast genome (plastome), has enabled the researchers to perform molecular phylogenetic analyses of 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic>. They reported that the complete plastome sequences of this genus are sufficiently polymorphic to be used as superbarcodes for its species. This in turn will facilitate the development of new molecular markers and allow studying the phylogenomic relationships of 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> species in the family Asteraceae.
