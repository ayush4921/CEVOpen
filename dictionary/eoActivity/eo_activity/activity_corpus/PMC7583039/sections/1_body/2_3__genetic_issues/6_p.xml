<p>
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> is one of the 530 genera of the Asteraceae family in which polyploidy was detected. It is a good example of polyploid series and ploidy-level variation, with both autopolyploids and allopolyploids reported [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-04415" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. According to Reference [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-25-04415" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], approximately 43.5% of 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> species are exclusively diploid and 29.7% are exclusively polyploid, while around 26.8% of species are both diploid and polyploid. The high percentage of polyploids and the ability of the species to colonize different ecosystems, as well as their adaptation to different habitat conditions, may be the main features that favored the successful expansion of this genus across the landscape.
