<p>According to Reference [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-04415" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], dysploidâ€“polyploid complexes have played a major role in the karyological evolution of 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic>. Dysploidy refers to change in the chromosomal base number through the rearrangement of chromatin and the loss or gain of a centromere without any change in the amount of chromatin in the karyotype. A high percentage of 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> species are polyploids, and the reported cytotypes cytogenetically differ in their external morphology, anatomy, fertility, and phytochemical characteristics [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-04415" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Among the species, 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> is quite diverse showing several cytotypes, of which 2
 <italic>n</italic> = 2
 <italic>x</italic> = 18 is the most common [
