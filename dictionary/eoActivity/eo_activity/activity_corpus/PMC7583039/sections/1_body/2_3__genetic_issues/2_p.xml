<p>According to Reference [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-04415" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> has two basic chromosome numbers, the largely predominating 
 <italic>x</italic> = 9 and the less extended 
 <italic>x</italic> = 8, with the ploidy levels ranging from diploid to dodecaploid in the species with 
 <italic>x</italic> = 9 chromosomes and from diploid to hexaploid in those with 
 <italic>x</italic> = 8 chromosomes. The chromosome number 
 <italic>x</italic> = 9 is the most common not only in the genus 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> but also in the tribe Anthemideae and the family Asteraceae [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-25-04415" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The evolutionary pathway determining the chromosome number in 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> is affected by the successive or simultaneous effects of polyploidy (both autopolyploidy and allopolyploidy) and dysploidy [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-04415" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The existence of two basic chromosome numbers indicates that 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> is a dysploid genus. Dysploidy is seen in 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic>, 
 <italic>Absinthium</italic>, and 
 <italic>Dracunculus</italic>, which are the three main groups of the genus, while 
 <italic>Seriphidium</italic> and 
 <italic>Tridentatae</italic> display only one basic chromosome number, 
 <italic>x</italic> = 9 [
