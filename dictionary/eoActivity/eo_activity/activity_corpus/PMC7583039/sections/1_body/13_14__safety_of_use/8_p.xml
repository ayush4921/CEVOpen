<p>Scientists from four Japanese centers—Science University of Tokyo (Tokyo), The Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN) (Wakō), Nagoya University School of Medicine (Nagoya), and Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute (Nagoya)—have isolated prunasin from

Prunasin is a cyanogenic glycoside that releases toxic hydrogen cyanide (HCN) during enzymatic hydrolysis by β-3-glucosidases in the macerated plant tissue or under the influence of intestinal microflora. In the human body, HCN combines with cytochrome oxidases and prevents oxygen access to tissues, thereby leading to body hypoxia [

 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> and its effect on the human body.
