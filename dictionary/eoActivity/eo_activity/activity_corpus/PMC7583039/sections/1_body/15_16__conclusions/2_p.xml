<p>Currently, 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> is the subject of numerous phytochemical and pharmacological studies. Phytochemical studies have proved the rich composition of the aerial parts of this plant, which consists of sesquiterpenoid lactones, flavonoids, and coumarins, and an essential oil made of qualitatively variable components. In turn, pharmacological studies have provided evidence of very valuable, previously unknown biological activities of the raw materials of 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic>, including antioxidant, hypolipemic, hepatoprotective, antispasmodic, analgesic, antihypertensive, estrogenic, cytotoxic, antibacterial, and antifungal effects. Due to the high variability in its chemical composition, this species is also subject to biotechnological research, where attempts are being made to genotypically multiply high-production plants using micropropagation methods. A major part of this research is conducted by non-European research centers. This is because the species is widely distributed on as many as four continents—Europe, Asia, North America, and South America—and there is a slightly greater interest in this species outside of Europe.
