<p>The Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) also recommends thermopuncture consisting in burning “moxa”—dried and powdered leaves of 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic>—directly on or close to the skin, or inhaling the resulting smoke, which allows the migration of “chi” energy [

 <xref rid="B93-molecules-25-04415" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>] investigated the harmfulness of compounds formed during the combustion of this plant species. The authors tested the smoke emitted by moxa for the presence of compounds commonly found in cigarettes, such as tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, ammonia, hydrogen cyanide, polyaromatic amines, volatile organic compounds, semi-volatile compounds, phenols, and carbonyls (e.g., formaldehyde and acetone), all of which are associated with the highest risk of cancer. Their results showed that even at concentrations higher by an order of magnitude than that achieved with the inhalation of normal smoke, only a few of the analytes exceeded the permissible standards. These included aromatic amines such as 1-aminonaphthalene, 2-aminonaphthalene, 3-aminobiphenyl, and 4-aminobiphenyl. Therefore, the authors concluded that burning moxa should not pose a health risk. Evidence of exceeded limits appeared only after the extrapolation of results for long-term use, which probably did not reflect the actual concentration of the tested compounds [
 <xref rid="B93-molecules-25-04415" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. In TCM, 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> is most often used in thermopuncture in the form of cotton buds impregnated with the plant extract, or as cigarettes filled with dried leaves and used to cauterize the skin.
