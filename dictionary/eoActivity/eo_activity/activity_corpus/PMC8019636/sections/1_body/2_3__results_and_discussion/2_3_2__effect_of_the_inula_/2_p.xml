<p>In this study, we found that appearance of papillomas depends on the type of treatment. Indeed, it was noticed that the appearance of the tumors increases in number and size with time. On the other hand, for the control mice, no lesions or tissue damage were observed, and the appearance of papillomas is very similar to the control mice.</p>
