<p>The treatment of carcinogenic mice with 
 <italic>Inula viscosa</italic> extract during the initiation and promotion phase showed a reduction of the tumor load (number of papillomas/mice); the mice stabilized in 2 papillomas whereas the number of papillomas in carcinogenic mice were 16 Â± 2.15 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(a)</xref>) with inhibition growth of papillomas, which can be as much as 87.5%. (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(b)</xref>) after 20 weeks of treatment. Therefore, the results obtained clearly show the presence of a protective effect due to the extract treatment. Our results are in agreement with some studies [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Phytotherapy has proved to be very promising. Indeed, 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> study showed that treatment with gallic acid induces the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation, through the suppression of DMBA action and croton oil by modulating the antioxidant and MMP-2/MMP-9 in Swiss albino mice [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In contrast, the results obtained suggest that extracts from 
 <italic>Inula viscosa</italic> have a strong antitumor effect effective in preventing DMBA-induced skin cancer. Hence, this observed difference could be explained by the fact that the process of carcinogenesis is multifactorial and made up of several steps. Therefore, for a good control, the treatment should be applied before, during, and after the installation of cancer.
