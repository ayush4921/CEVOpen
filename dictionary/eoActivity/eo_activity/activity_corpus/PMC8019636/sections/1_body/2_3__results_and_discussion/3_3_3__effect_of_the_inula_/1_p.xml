<p>To evaluate the effect of 
 <italic>Inula viscosa</italic> extract on tumor development in mice, abdominal injections were applied during the promotion phase. The carcinogenic mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(a)</xref>) not treated with plant extract showed average number of papillomas of 16 ± 2.15 after 20 weeks. Furthermore, a significant reduction of papillomas was observed in the group treated with 
 <italic>Inula viscosa</italic> (5 ± 1.25). Therefore, the control mice did not produce any papilloma on their skin but 100% of the DMBA-treated mice developed papilloma growth until the end of 20 weeks. 
 <italic>Inula viscosa</italic>-treated groups of mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(b)</xref>) demonstrated slower growth of papillomas (31.25%).
