<p>The carcinogenic mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(a)</xref>) not treated with plant extract showed a mean number of papillomas of 16 ± 2.15 after 20 weeks. However, a significant reduction of papillomas was observed in the group treated with 
 <italic>Inula viscosa</italic> (6 ± 1.5). Therefore, the control mice did not produce any papilloma on their skin but 100% of the DMBA-treated mice developed papilloma growth until the end of 20 weeks (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(b)</xref>). 
 <italic>Inula viscosa</italic>-treated groups of mice demonstrated slower growth of papillomas (37.5%).
