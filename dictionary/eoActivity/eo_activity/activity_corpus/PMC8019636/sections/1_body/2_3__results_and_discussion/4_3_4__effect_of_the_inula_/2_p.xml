<p>DMBA is a very potent carcinogen, which can lead to mutations in cellular DNA. The critical event in the initiation of carcinogenesis by DMBA is the conversion of DMBA to reactive oxygen species by a set of enzymes that metabolize xenobiotics. Croton oil is rich in phorbol esters; it can act as tumor promoters by activating protein kinase C. The increase in the concentration of active oxygen, organic peroxides, and radicals in cells can also promote neoplastic growth of initiated cells [

The key mechanism of action of the majority of chemopreventive agents is their potential to prevent either the metabolic activation of procarcinogens or the neutralization of reactive metabolites and free radicals generated during the process of carcinogenesis [
