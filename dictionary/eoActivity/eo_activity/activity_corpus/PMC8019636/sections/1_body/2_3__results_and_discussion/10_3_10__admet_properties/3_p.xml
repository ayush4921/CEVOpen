<p>Compounds with a BBB less than 1 are considered poorly distributed in the brain. The BBB permeability results in (

The molecule with less than 30% absorbance is considered poorly absorbed, indicating that all compounds tested could be absorbed from the human gut; however, the cytochrome P450 subtypes CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 indicate that the compounds inuviscolide and tomentosin could not be substrates or inhibitors for the two major subtypes and therefore would likely not be metabolized. Fortunately, our best candidate compound isocosticacid showed no acute toxicity and no mutagenic effects compared to the Ames test data (
