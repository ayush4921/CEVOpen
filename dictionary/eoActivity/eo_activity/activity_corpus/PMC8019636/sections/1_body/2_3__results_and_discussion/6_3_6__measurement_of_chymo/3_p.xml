<p>Treatments based on the 
 <italic>Inula viscosa</italic> extract have been shown to be effective in the treatment of skin carcinoma. In addition, this extract contains phenolic compounds and/or flavonoids known for their antioxidant effects [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and contains bioactive molecules with structures similar and close to those of chemically synthesized proteasome inhibitors, capable of effectively inhibiting the ubiquitin proteasome complex, more specifically the catalytic activity of the latter. Based on these data, it can be concluded that treatment with 
 <italic>Inula viscosa</italic> extract causes a regression of the tumor load with a decrease in serum and intracellular activities.
