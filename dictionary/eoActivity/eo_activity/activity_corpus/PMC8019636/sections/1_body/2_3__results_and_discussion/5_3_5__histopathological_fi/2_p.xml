<p>Nonetheless, according to these data, it can be proposed that our extract exerts its antitumor effects either at the initiation phase by protecting the DNA from mutations caused by the action of DMBA [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] or during the promotion phase through the neutralization of the microenvironment of free radicals [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], which favor the setting up of a carcinogenesis process. The results obtained showed that our extract exerts their effect during both phases. This translates into the best reduction in the number of papillomas observed when the mice are treated during both phases (initiation and promotion) compared to those treated during the initiation phase alone, and/or the promotion phase alone.
