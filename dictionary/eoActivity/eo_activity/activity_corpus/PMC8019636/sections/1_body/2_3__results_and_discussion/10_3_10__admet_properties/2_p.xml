<p>The objective of the ADMET preclinical study is to eliminate weak candidates and focus on successful drug candidates. This study addresses the applicability of the three compounds proposed as anticancer agents using the virtual properties, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity, which are crucial actors in drug development. The pharmacokinetic properties have been calculated using admetSAR. Therefore, penetration of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), human intestinal absorption (HIA), Caco-2 cell permeability, and AMES test are used to specify drug-like properties. Penetration of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is an important property since it determines whether or not drugs can cross the blood-brain barrier and also exert its effect on the brain [
