<p>The analysis of the type of binding and the calculation of the energy score of 14 compounds extracted from 
 <italic>Inula viscosa</italic> with the proteasome 20S (PDB: 4R3O) allows the selection of the best compounds. Three molecules were selected on the basis of their low energy values. The energy values of tomentosin, inuviscolide, and isocosticacid are -65.53, -64.53, and -60.68, respectively, for 
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>1</sub>, and -62.63, -62.09, and -57.90 for 
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>, and -61.23, 62.41, and 60.37 for
