<p>Skin is made of three large layers: epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis. This is made up of a variety of distinct cell types, the primary components being keratinocytes and melanocytes. Keratinocytes, which compose 95% of the epidermis, are organized into four layers. The inner layer is the stratum germinativum (stratum basale, basal layer), from which column-shaped keratinocytes divide to migrate to the next layer. Two layers of small, undifferentiated epidermis cells differentiate into different layers following exposure to a local carcinogen. The papillary layer in the dermis is a subepithelial layer of tightly arranged, fine collagenous fiber and fiber bundles. The dermis reticular layer comprises coarse collagenous fibers of considerable thickness [
