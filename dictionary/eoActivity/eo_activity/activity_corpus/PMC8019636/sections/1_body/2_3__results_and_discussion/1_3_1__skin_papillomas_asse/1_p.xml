<p>In order to evaluate the antitumor potential of 
 <italic>Inula viscosa</italic> extract, three groups of mice were used, including a control group, a carcinogenesis group, and a group treated with 
 <italic>Inula viscosa</italic> extract during the tumor initiation and promotion phases (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The skin of the control mice did not develop any papilloma growth, whereas all mice in the carcinogenesis group demonstrated increasing formation of papillomas. Therefore, the mice treated with intraperitoneal injections of 
 <italic>Inula viscosa</italic> extract demonstrated a reduced occurrence of the growth of papilloma compared to the carcinogen mice. Moreover, the best chemopreventive action of 
 <italic>Inula viscosa</italic> was observed in mice in which extract treatment was performed before and after the induction of skin carcinogenesis.
