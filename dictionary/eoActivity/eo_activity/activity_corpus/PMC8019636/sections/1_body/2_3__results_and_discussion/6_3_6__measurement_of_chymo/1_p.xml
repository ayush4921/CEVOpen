<p>It can be seen from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> that at the serum level, the catalytic activity of the proteasome of mice from groups treated with 
 <italic>Inula viscosa</italic> extracts (691.14 ± 8.55 FU) was significantly lower (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.001) compared to that measured in mice from the carcinogenesis group (1294 ± 34.1 FU), whereas the lowest catalytic activity was measured in the control group (455.63 ± 22.75 FU). The intracellular proteasome catalytic activity of mice in 
 <italic>Inula viscosa</italic>-treated groups (1020 ± 18.1 FU) was lower compared to that measured in the carcinogenesis group (1612 ± 30.2 FU), while mice in the control group still showed the lowest proteasome catalytic activity (733 ± 36.65 FU).
