<p>Therefore, the catalytic activity of proteasome at serum and intracellular levels was very important in mice of the carcinogenic group than in mice of the groups treated with 
 <italic>Inula viscosa</italic> extract. These data are in agreement with several findings using the approach of proteasome inhibition by chemically synthesized inhibitors [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>–
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Indeed, Lavabre et al. in 2001, in a study of solid tumors, showed a total regression of the tumors accompanied by a decrease in the concentration of proteasome as well as its catalytic activity with treatment with chemically synthesized proteasome inhibitors such as epoxomicin and bortezomib. Furthermore, subsequent studies performed in our laboratory by Filali et al. [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] on Moroccan patients with hematological malignancies suggest that treatment with proteasome inhibitors, in addition to tumor regression, induces a decrease in proteasome concentration and catalytic activity. Hence, it can be considered that proteasome could be a new factor in the diagnosis and follow-up of treatment in cancer diseases [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Based on these data, the proteasome could be a key factor in the neoplastic differentiation of cells, a novel cancer biomarker, and a key element in the clinical follow-up of patients with skin cancer. Hence, the analysis of the catalytic activity provides information on the functionality of the complex and consequently on its molecular nature at the serum and subcellular levels. Several studies [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] demonstrate that only the inhibition of chymotrypsin-like activity, carried by the 
 <italic>β</italic>5 subunits, is sufficient to allow a significant reduction in the rate of protein degradation while the inactivation of the other sites, trypsin-like and PGPH, has little effect on total proteolysis.
