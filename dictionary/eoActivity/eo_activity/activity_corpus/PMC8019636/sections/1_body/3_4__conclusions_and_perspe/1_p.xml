<p>In conclusion, this study revealed that the treatment with 
 <italic>Inula viscosa</italic> extract shows a strong inhibition for the appearance of tumors in the form of papillomas, which is clearly demonstrated by the decreased activity at the serum and intracellular levels. Therefore, the docking studies remain a very effective tool and essential study to identify the degrees of structural similarity and the percentage of predictive inhibition of proteasome subunits by bioactive molecules. The data obtained clearly show that 
 <italic>Inula viscosa</italic> extract contains bioactive molecules with a much greater proteasome inhibition potentials than the chemically synthesized inhibitors and could be better new candidates in targeted therapy against skin carcinoma. However, it would be interesting to isolate and purify these molecules particularly (tomentosin, inuviscolide, and isocosticacid), in order to test them, in a later work, on other cancerous diseases.
