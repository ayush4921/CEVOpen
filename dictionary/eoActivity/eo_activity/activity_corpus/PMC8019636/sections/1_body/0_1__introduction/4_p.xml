 <italic>Inula viscosa</italic> (L.) Aiton (Compositae) locally called “Magramane” is a perennial herbaceous plant distributed in different regions of the Mediterranean Basin [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Therefore, the plant has been used in traditional medicine for treatment of different diseases, including anti-inflammatory [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], anthelmintic [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], antipyretic, antiseptic, and antiphlogistic activities [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In fact, crude extracts prepared from different parts of 
 <italic>Inula viscosa</italic> demonstrated antioxidant [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and cytotoxic activities on large variety of cancerous cells [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The present study is aimed at investigating the antitumor promoting effect and proteasome inhibitors of 
 <italic>Inula viscosa</italic> extract in a specific model of DMBA/croton oil-induced skin carcinoma in mice. Indeed, the study of structure–activity relationships of bioactive molecules of 
 <italic>Inula viscosa</italic> extract allows us to visualize its powerful inhibition for the subunits of the proteasome.
