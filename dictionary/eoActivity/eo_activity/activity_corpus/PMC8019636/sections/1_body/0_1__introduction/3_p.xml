<p>Recent studies on the function of these subunits demonstrated that inhibition of

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Therefore, the use of medicinal plants is an ancient practice because these plants have generated very encouraging therapeutic results with fewer side effects observed during their use since they are less offensive and less harmful to the body [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Besides, they are relatively less expensive than modern medicine. Given this explosion in the use of medicinal plants and their beneficial effects, we thought it would be interesting to examine the antitumor effect of 
 <italic>Inula viscosa</italic> on the progression of skin cancer in mice.
