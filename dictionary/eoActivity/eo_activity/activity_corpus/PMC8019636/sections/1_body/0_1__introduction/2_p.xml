<p>At the heart of this system is the proteasome, which is an essential protease in eukaryotes. The proteolytic core of this complex called proteasome 20S is shaped like a hollow cylinder containing the catalytic sites in internal cavity. Crystal structure (PDB: 4R3O) shows that the active sites of the 20S proteasome are mainly located on the
