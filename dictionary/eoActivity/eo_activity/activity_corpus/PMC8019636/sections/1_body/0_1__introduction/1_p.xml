<p>The ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) plays a fundamental role in intracellular proteolysis. Furthermore, its central role is the degradation of abnormal proteins. Indeed, it is vital for the regulated degradation of intracellular proteins and is directly involved in the regulation of most biological processes such as cell cycle, apoptosis, muscle differentiation, or immune response [
