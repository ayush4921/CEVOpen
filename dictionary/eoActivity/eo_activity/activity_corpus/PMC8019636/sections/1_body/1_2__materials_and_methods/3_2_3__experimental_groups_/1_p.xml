<p>In order to determine the nonlethal dose of the 
 <italic>Inula viscosa</italic> plant extract, a toxicity test was performed. In fact, decreasing concentrations and/or volumes of the extract were used until obtaining a dose that does not cause lethality on mice. This dose was then used in the same mouse for 4 days, a period chosen to mimic the protocol used during the treatment with the extracts. The volume used was 25 
 <italic>μ</italic>L and adjusted to 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The anticancer potential of the prepared extract was evaluated by administering 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of the extract to mice as skin cancer was in parallel induced.
