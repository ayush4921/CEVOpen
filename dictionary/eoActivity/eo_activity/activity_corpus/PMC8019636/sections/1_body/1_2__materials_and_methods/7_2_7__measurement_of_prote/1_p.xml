<p>The catalytic activity (chymotrypsin-like) of the 20S proteasome on the fluorogenic peptide Leu-Leu-succinyl-Val-Tyr-Amido-4-methylcoumarin (Suc-LLVY-AMC) was determined after substrate incubation with the sample at 37°C for over 3 h. The fluorescence emitted after cleavage of the AMC is determined using a Fluorometer (Hoefer Scientific Instruments). The excitement of peptides, coupled at the AMC, is done through a 360/40 nm filter at a wavelength between 340 nm and 380 nm with a maximum of 360 nm. The fluorescence emitted after digestion of peptides coupled to the AMC reads on the 460/40 nm filter. To convert the fluorescence unit (FU) issued 
 <italic>μ</italic>mol of used fluorophores, a standard AMC range was established from a stock solution of AMC at 10-3 m. The excitement of the AMC is done at a wavelength of 360/40 nm, and the signal is then recovered on the 460/40 nm filters [
