<p>To induce carcinogenesis in mice, approximately 2.5 cm
 <sup>2</sup> of dorsal body wall hair was removed by shaving with electric clippers followed by the application of depilatory cream one day prior to the beginning of the experiment. Thereafter, the mice were initiated by a single topical application of DMBA (100

 <italic>μ</italic>L acetone) on shaved dorsal skin (initiation phase) and, 2 weeks later, promoted by twice-weekly topically applications of 1% croton oil (1

 <italic>μ</italic>L acetone) at the same site for 20 weeks (promotion phase). The normal control mice received only acetone in place of DMBA and croton oil [
