 <italic>Inula viscosa</italic> L. was collected from the regions of Taza, Morocco. Thereafter, it was dried away from light and humidity at room temperature. Once dried, the plant material was reduced to powder using electric propeller mill and extract under reflux. The method used is called maceration. Ethanol extraction was performed at the ratio of 10% (
