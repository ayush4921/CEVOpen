<p>High-speed virtual screening was performed using the iGEMDOCK (Generic Evolution Method for Docking) program [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The 
 <italic>in silico</italic> screening of 14 compound extracted from 
 <italic>Inula viscosa</italic> was performed using the PDB code of the targets (PDB ID: 4R3O); the screening score, which is based on total energy calculations (total energy = van der Waals (VdW) + hydrogen bond (HBond) + electrostatic), was calculated using iGEMDOCK v2.1.11.
