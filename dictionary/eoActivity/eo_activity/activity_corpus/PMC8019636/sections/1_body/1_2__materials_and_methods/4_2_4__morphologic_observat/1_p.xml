<p>During the 20 weeks of experiments, mice were observed daily for the appearance of skin papillomas tumor, volume, and body weights, which were recorded at interval of 7 days until sacrifice. Tumors were counted, measured, and scored weekly as clinically apparent papillomas (typically well-demarcated, asymmetrical, pedunculated, or dome-shaped papules, without erosion or ulceration) or clinically apparent carcinomas (poorly demarcated, asymmetrical, sessile, or dome-shaped papules with erosion or ulceration). Tumors were evaluated by visual inspection to the experimental groups.</p>
