<p>To develop a drug, several steps are necessary, starting with target identification and ending with ADMET prediction. Therefore, the early determination of these properties is very necessary to reduce the cost and also the time of the drug discovery process. These parameters include the absorption of the drug (absorption), the distribution in the body (distribution), the biochemical remodeling (metabolism), excretion, and toxicity. In this perspective, the best three molecules selected on the basis of their score energy and which showed better affinity have been evaluated to determine these pharmacokinetic parameters
