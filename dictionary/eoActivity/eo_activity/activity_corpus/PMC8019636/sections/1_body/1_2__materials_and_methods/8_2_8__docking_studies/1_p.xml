<p>For this study, plant compounds were collected from the PubChem database. A total of 14 molecules are reported to be isolated from 
 <italic>Inula viscosa</italic> L.; these molecules were considered for the study of molecular docking. Therefore, the X-ray crystalline 3D structure of the proteasome 20S (PDB: 4R3O, resolution 2.60 Å) was obtained from the Data Bank Protein [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and prepared by Discovery Studio 2020 [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] by removing water molecules, and polar hydrogen was added, the 4r3o PDB file containing 28 chains, 2 chains (1,M) for 
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>1</sub>, 2 chains (K,Y) for 
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>, and 2 chains (L,Z) for 
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>5</sub>. The rest of the chains are removed and only the 
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>1</sub>, 
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>, and 
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>5</sub> chains kept to speed up and simplify the calculations.
