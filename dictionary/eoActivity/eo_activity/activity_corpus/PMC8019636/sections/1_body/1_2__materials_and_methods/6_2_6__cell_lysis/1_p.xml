<p>The serum is recovered from a mouse blood sample and gradually cooled to 4°C and -20°C. Lymphocyte the pellet is recovered by lysis of red blood cells. First, we proceed to the preparation of the white cell pellet. Briefly, red cells of the blood samples were broken by adding a solution of Tris-EDTA (20/5) to whole blood after centrifugation, the supernatant is removed, and this procedure was repeated until a clear cell layer is obtained. Thereafter, 200 mU/L of lysis buffer (10 mM KCl, 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM EDTA pH 7.1, 0.1 mM DTT, and 1% Triton, supplemented with protease inhibitors (PMSF 2 nM)) was added on each sample. The cells are disrupted with alternating periods of 20 s break with 30 s rest to avoid excessive heating of samples that can cause denaturation of enzymes [
