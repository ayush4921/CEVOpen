<p>The results were visualized by the Discovery Studio Visualizer [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and PyMOL [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The results of the molecules showed an interesting docking score, and their positioning inside the active site was also compared as well as type of interactions established by each molecule inside the active site.
