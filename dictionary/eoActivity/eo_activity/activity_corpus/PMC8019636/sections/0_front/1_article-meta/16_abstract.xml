 <p>The aim of this work is to evaluate the antitumor effect mediated by the proteasome inhibitors of 
  <italic>Inula viscosa</italic> extracts on skin carcinogenesis. Female Swiss albino mice were divided into five groups depending on the combination of skin cancer-inducing 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) and extract of 
  <italic>Inula viscosa</italic> treatments. Histology of the affected skin and measurement of proteasome activity were performed to demonstrate the effect of 
  <italic>Inula viscosa</italic> on mice. The identification of the molecules responsible for this inhibitory activity was carried out through the docking studies. The results showed that 
  <italic>Inula viscosa</italic> extracts inhibit the development of papilloma in mice. Therefore, the best chemopreventive action of 
  <italic>Inula viscosa</italic> was observed on mice in which extract treatment was performed before and after the induction of skin carcinogenesis. It was revealed that the ingestion of extracts 
  <italic>Inula viscosa</italic> delays the formation of skin papillomas in animals and simultaneously decreases the size and number of papillomas, which is also reflected on the skin histology of the mice treated. Structure–activity relationship information obtained from component of 
  <italic>Inula viscosa</italic> particularly tomentosin, inuviscolide, and isocosticacid demonstrated that distinct bonding modes in 
  <italic>β</italic>
  <sub>1</sub>, 
  <italic>β</italic>
  <sub>2</sub>, and 
  <italic>β</italic>
  <sub>5</sub> subunits determine its selectivity and potent inhibition for 
  <italic>β</italic>
  <sub>5</sub> subunit.
