<p>The proteasome inhibition for anticancer therapy, particularly by natural compounds, has produced distinct and promising outcomes of cancer treatment. The use of a proteasome inhibitor might be an effective strategy in the treatment of skin cancer. 
 <italic>Inula viscosa</italic> (L.) Aiton (Compositae) is a medicinal plant distributed in different regions of the Mediterranean Basin. Therefore, the plant has been used in traditional medicine for treatment of different diseases, including cancer treatment. 
 <italic>In vivo</italic> studies showed that 
 <italic>Inula viscosa</italic> extracts inhibit the development of skin carcinoma induced by DMBA in the mouse. Docking studies showed that 
 <italic>Inula viscosa</italic> extract contains bioactive molecules with a much greater proteasome inhibition potentials than the chemically synthesized inhibitors and could be better new candidates in targeted therapy against skin carcinoma.
