<p>Although the conclusive MIC and MBC data of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> against impetigo-causing bacteria is not readily available, possibly attributed to the lack of standardized antimicrobial activity test for H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and topical antiseptics in general [
 <xref rid="B125-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. However, this agent has been explored in a randomized controlled trial involving impetigo patients. Christensen and Anehus (1994) [
 <xref rid="B128-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>] examined the efficacy of topical H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (1%,

 <italic>w</italic>) cream in comparison with topical fusidic acid (2%, w/w) cream/gel, given 2–3 times daily for 3 weeks in non-bullous impetigo patients (
 <italic>n</italic> = 256, 78% of them had 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, whereas 8% found with 
 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> and 14 % with co-infection). After three weeks, 72% (92/128) of the patients in H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> group were healed compared with 82% (105/128) in fusidic acid group (95%CI for odds ratio: 0.604–1.271), demonstrating H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> was not inferior to fusidic acid, which could promote its efficacy for impetigo treatment. Despite lack of conclusive evidence to support the use of topical antiseptics for impetigo [
 <xref rid="B13-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], guidelines in New Zealand and UK have recently recommended the use of topical H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> as an initial treatment for localised non-bullous impetigo [
 <xref rid="B129-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. The results from a Phase IV randomised controlled trial (
 <italic>n</italic> = 480) [
 <xref rid="B130-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>] exploring the efficacy of H

 <sub>2</sub>, 1% cream for mild impetigo treatment is likely to provide additional insight into the utility of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> for impetigo treatment.
