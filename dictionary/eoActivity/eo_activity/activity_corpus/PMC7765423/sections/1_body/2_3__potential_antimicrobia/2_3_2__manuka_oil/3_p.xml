<p>The actual mechanism of action for MO has not yet been identified but evidence (Alnaimat M. S., 2015, unpublished data) [
 <xref rid="B122-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>] suggests cytoplasmic membrane as a primary target in Gram-positive bacteria basing on the marked cellular lysis observed in MO treated MRSA cells as opposed to the untreated MRSA cells. Compared with TTO, MO has not been extensively investigated for impetigo causing bacteria particularly for 
 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic>, but the available preliminary evidence and its long history of medicinal use for the treatment of skin infections warrants exploring appropriate MO-based formulations for their potential usefulness in impetigo treatment.
