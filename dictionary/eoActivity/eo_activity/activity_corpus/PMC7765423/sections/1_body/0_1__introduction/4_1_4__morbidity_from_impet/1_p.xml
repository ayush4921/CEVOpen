<p>Morbidity of impetigo depends on the bacterial aetiology [
 <xref rid="B15-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In impetigo elicited by 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, local and systemic spread of infection could result in cellulitis, lymphangitis, or septicaemia (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-09-00909-f003">Figure 3</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B13-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Skin infections are the most common signs of initial infection leading to Staphylococcal bacteraemia [
 <xref rid="B25-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In Australia, the 30-day all-cause mortality rate for 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> sepsis was 16.7% in 2016 and 14.8% in 2017, based on the Antimicrobial use and Resistance (AURA) 2019 report [
 <xref rid="B25-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The annual incidence of invasive 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> is 10 times higher (46.6 v 4.4 per 100,000 children) in the Indigenous paediatric population compared with the non-Indigenous counterparts living in impetigo endemic settings [
 <xref rid="B26-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> sepsis has a mortality rate of 3â€“5% in children aged under 18 years, with particularly poor health outcomes in Indigenous children [
 <xref rid="B27-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Similarly, infection with GAS can cause GAS bacteraemia, and Indigenous children (incidence, 69.7 per 100,000 per year) have the highest reported rates of invasive GAS, as opposed to non-Indigenous children (incidence, 8.8 per 100,000 per year) [
 <xref rid="B28-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. It can also cause acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN) and acute rheumatic fever (ARF), inflammatory illnesses that can potentially lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD), respectively [
