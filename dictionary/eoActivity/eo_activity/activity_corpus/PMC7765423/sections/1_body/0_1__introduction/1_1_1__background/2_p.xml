<p>Impetigo (school sores), a common superficial skin infection [
 <xref rid="B4-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], is a huge problem worldwide, affecting &gt;2% of the global population [
 <xref rid="B3-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and an estimated 162 million children (particularly those between the age of 2 and 5 years) suffer from impetigo at any one time [
 <xref rid="B5-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It is one of eight dermatologic conditions listed in the 50 most common causes of disease in the Global Burden of Disease study [
 <xref rid="B7-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and is the only skin condition with potentially life-threatening complications [
 <xref rid="B8-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It is endemic in a number of low-and middle-income tropical countries, with the highest burden (median prevalence 19.4%) in underprivileged children from marginalised communities of high-income countries [
 <xref rid="B5-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In Australia, up to 49% of Aboriginal children living in remote communities are affected by impetigo at any given time (median prevalence of 44.5%) [
 <xref rid="B5-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], accounting for the highest rate documented anywhere in the world [
 <xref rid="B9-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Given impetigo is considered a disease of the poor (i.e., burden increases as socio-economic status decreases), and its contagious nature [
 <xref rid="B5-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], inadequate housing, and poor hygiene practices contribute to the growing burden of impetigo in the community [
