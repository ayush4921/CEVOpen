<p>The resulting inflammatory response was checked and monitored by measurement of edema formation and by microscopic observation. For morphological examination of cutaneous inflammation, biopsies from control and treated ears of animals were collected at the end of the experiment. Samples were fixed using 10% neutral buffered formalin, routinely processed, and sectioned at 6 µm using a microtome (Leica RM 2125RT, Nussloch, Germany). Sections were stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) and the tissues were observed with a light microscope (Olympus CX41, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and graded as mild (+), moderate (++), and severe (+++) for inflammation phase. Infiltration and polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells’ accumulations were also assessed [
