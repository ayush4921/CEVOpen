<p>This technique is based on a report by Bouhlali et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-03671" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Carrageenan is known to result in at least neutrophil-linked edematous inflammation. LSEO was diluted in 0.5% Tween 80 and administered 30 min prior to carrageenan injection. The control group received an equivalent volume of the vehicle (0.5% Tween 80 in 0.9% NaCl solution). LSEO at doses of 2, 20, or 200 mg/kg and vehicle were administrated 
 <italic>per os</italic> (
 <italic>p.o.</italic>) 30 min before injecting the carrageenan. Paw edema was induced with a single 0.1 mL sub-plantar injection of carrageenan (0.1 mL) into the left hind paw of conscious mice. Indomethacin (25 mg/kg, 
 <italic>p.o.</italic>) was used as positive control (NSAID). The mice were sacrificed 4 h later. The difference in weight between right untreated and left treated hind paws was calculated and results are expressed as the increase in paw weight (mg). The percentage inhibition of the inflammatory response was calculated for each mouse by comparison to the negative control, and calculated using the following formula:
