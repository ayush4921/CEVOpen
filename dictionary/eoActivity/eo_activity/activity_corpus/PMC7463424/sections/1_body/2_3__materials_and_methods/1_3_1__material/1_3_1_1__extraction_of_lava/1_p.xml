 <italic>Lavandula stoechas</italic> (Lamiaceae family) aerial parts were collected in 2016 in the region of Cherchell (Tipaza, Algeria). This area is located in the western region of Algiers and is situated at 36°34′3.014″ N and 12′14.376″ E in the central north of the country. LSEO was distilled from the leaves, stems, and flowers using alembic steam distillation. The process consists of passing water vapor at a high-pressure through an alembic (tank) filled with aromatic plants. The steam captures the volatile compounds that are confined in the secretory glands of the aromatic herb, which then pass through a cold-water frozen serpentine and condense into a liquid. Upon exit, phases of diverse densities are separated with the help of a “Florentine vase” and floral water and EO (also named “aromatic water”) are obtained.
