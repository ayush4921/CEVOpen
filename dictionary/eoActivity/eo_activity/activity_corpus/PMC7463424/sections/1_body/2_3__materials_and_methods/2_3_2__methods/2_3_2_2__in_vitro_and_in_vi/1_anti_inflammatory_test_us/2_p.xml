<p>Hypotonicity-induced hemolysis: Different concentrations of LSEO (6–0.4 µL/mL) were prepared using distilled water, and to each concentration 1 mL of PBS, 2 mL hyposaline and 0.5 mL of HRBC suspension were added. It was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 20 min. The hemoglobin content of the supernatant solution was estimated spectrophotometrically at 560 nm. Sodium diclofenac as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) was used as a reference standard and a control was prepared by omitting the LSEO. The percentage inhibition of hemolysis or membrane stabilization was calculated according to the method described by Parvin et al. [
