<p>Analysis and identification of the volatile compounds were performed using a Shimadzu GC-17A Gas Chromatograph coupled with a Shimadzu QP-5050A Mass Spectrometer detector (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). The GC-MS system was equipped with a Tracsil Meta.X5 (95% dimethylpolysiloxane and 5% diphenylpolysiloxane) column (60 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm film thickness). Analyses were carried out using helium as the carrier gas at a column flow rate of 0.3 mL/min and a total flow of 3.9 mL/min in a split ratio of 1:200 and the following program: (a) 80 °C for 0 min; (b) increase of 3 °C/min from 80 °C to 210 °C and hold for 1 min; (c) increase of 25 °C/min from 210 °C to 300 °C and hold for 3 min. The temperatures of the injector and detector were 230 °C and 300 °C, respectively. All compounds were identified using two different analytical methods: (1) comparison of experimental retention indexes (RI) with those of the literature; (2) mass spectra (authentic chemicals and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST05) spectral library collection). Only fully identified compounds are reported in this study.</p>
