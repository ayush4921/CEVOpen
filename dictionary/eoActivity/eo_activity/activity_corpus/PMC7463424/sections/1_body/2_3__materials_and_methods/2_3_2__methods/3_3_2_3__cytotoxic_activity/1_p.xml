<p>MDA-MB-231, AGS, and MV3 cells were grown in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin (100 U/mL) and streptomycin (100 µg/mL). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> and regularly examined using an inverted microscope. The medium was replaced every two days and cells were sub-cultured at 70%–80% confluence. Cells in 96-well plates (100 µL/well) were exposed to different concentrations of LSEO (4 to 0.0312 µL/mL) in DMSO/RPMI (0.1%

 <sup>3</sup> cells per well) and incubated for 24 h. Then, 100 µL of culture medium containing the specified concentration of the LSEO was added to each well. After exposure to serial concentrations of LSEO for 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, 100 µL of medium were carefully aspirated from each well and replaced by 100 µL of MTT solution (5 mg/mL in PBS). After addition of 100 µL PBS containing 0.5 mg/mL MTT, cells were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. Formed formazan crystals were dissolved in 50 µL DMSO. Absorbances in the control and LSEO-treated wells were measured at 490 nm with an ELISA reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA). Growth inhibition was calculated as follows:
