<p>The capability of LSEO to inhibit the denaturation of BSA was investigated by a method as reported by Rahman et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-03671" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Typically, different concentrations (6–0.4 µL/mL) of LSEO were prepared and the volumes were adjusted to 2.5 mL with 0.85% NaCl. Then 0.5 mL of BSA (5 mg/mL) was added. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min and further incubated at 55 °C for 30 min. The tubes were cooled and 2.5 mL of 0.5 M PBS (pH 6.3) was added. The turbidity was measured spectrophotometrically at 560 nm. The assay was carried out in triplicates and the standard (sodium diclofenac) was used in place of the LSEO. Percentage inhibition of BSA denaturation was evaluated as follow:
