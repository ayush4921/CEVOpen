 <italic>Lavandula</italic> is an important genus of the Lamiaceae family that comprises EO-producing plants relevant to the food, cosmetic, perfumery, and pharmaceutical industries. 
 <italic>Lavandula stoechas</italic> essential oils (LSEO) from lavender plants have been used for the first aid cure of wounds, abscesses, and burns [

 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-03671" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] demonstrated anxiolytic, sedative, and antispasmodic activities. The chemical composition and antimicrobial evaluation of LSEO have been the subject of several studies over the years [

 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-03671" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, there are very few detailed publications on its anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties. To our knowledge, the EO of 
 <italic>L. stoechas</italic> grown in the Cherchell region (North-Center of Algeria) has not yet been reported in the literature. Taking this into account, the present research was designed to evaluate, for the first time, the in vitro anticancer activity of Algerian LSEO against different cancer cell lines as well as its in vitro and in vivo topical and acute anti-inflammatory properties.
