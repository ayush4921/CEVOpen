<p>Recent findings have expanded the concept that inflammation is a serious component of cancer growth and progression. Chronic inflammation has been associated to several steps involved in carcinogenesis, comprising cellular alteration, promotion, proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis [

It is now becoming clear that the tumor microenvironment, which is largely orchestrated by inflammatory cells, is an indispensable participant in the neoplastic process, fostering proliferation, survival, and migration [
