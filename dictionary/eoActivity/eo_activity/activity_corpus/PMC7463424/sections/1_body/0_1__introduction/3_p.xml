<p>In this context, drug discoveries of new agents with anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties have a unique interest for medical care. Several in vivo and in vitro models of inflammation and cancer have been used for the discovery of new therapeutic agents. The identification of antitumor or anticancer properties could test the drug in different cancer cell lines with a principal objective of separating features associated with cytotoxic effect toward many cell lines from those that affect only a specific cell type [
