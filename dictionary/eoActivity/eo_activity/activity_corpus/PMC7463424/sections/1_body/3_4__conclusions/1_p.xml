<p>In conclusion, we describe for the first time the anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects of LSEO and its chemical composition. Our results show that LSEO has important in vitro and in vivo anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic effects against melanoma, breast cancer, and gastric cancer cells. These data may serve as valuable research references for clinical research of medicines for treatment of inflammation and cancer in the future and also a tool promoting the use of therapeutic benefits of EOs. Considering that drugs currently available for the treatment of inflammatory and cancer conditions show undesirable side effects, the present results may have clinical relevance and open new possibilities for the development of novel anti-inflammatory and anticancer drugs. Further studies to elucidate the mechanisms of action, and the possible compounds involved in these activities, will be undertaken.</p>
