<p>By histological comparison, topical application of LSEO decreased ear thickness and associated pathological indicators to an extent comparable to the positive controls (sodium diclofenac and betamethasone gels) (

These findings directly demonstrate the properties of LSEO within the target tissue, providing additional confirmation that LSEO ameliorates xylene-induced contact dermatitis. Microscopic investigation showed the valuable anti-inflammatory activity of the topical application with LSEO. Compared to the control groups, edema was dramatically reduced by the previous topical treatment with LSEO (
