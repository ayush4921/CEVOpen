<p>The most commonly used drugs for management of inflammatory conditions are NSAIDs and steroids, which have several adverse effects, especially gastric irritation leading to formation of gastric ulcers [

The preliminary screening with the BSA assay indicated that LSEO has significant levels of protection against heat denaturation of the protein. Therefore, protection against protein denaturation, which was the central mechanism of action of NSAIDs, could play an important part in anti-rheumatic and anti-inflammatory actions. The anti-inflammatory effect of EOs may be due to the presence of oxygenated monoterpenes such as eucalyptol and linalool either singly or in combination [
