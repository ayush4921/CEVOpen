<p>Current results are consistent with previous publications about other EOs using the carrageenan and xylene-induced edema methods [

 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-03671" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In addition, the current results are in agreement with our previous research [

In conclusion, the results of our investigation support the traditional usage of LSEO as an anti-inflammatory agent, although there is a need for further investigations to better estimate its pharmaceutical potential and understand its mode of action.
