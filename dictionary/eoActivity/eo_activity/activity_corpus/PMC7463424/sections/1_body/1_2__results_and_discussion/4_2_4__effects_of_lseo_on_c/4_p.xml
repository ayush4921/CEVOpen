<p>LSEO with an anti-proliferative activity shows also in vitro and in vivo anti-inflammatory properties. Even though there is a relationship between these two activities, the various mechanisms involved for each EO could explain why there is variability of these effects. A link between inflammation and cancer has long been suspected, but its molecular nature remains to be defined. Chronic inflammation may directly affect the cells that eventually become transformed as well as exert indirect effects on the tumor cell through surrounding cells [

In summary, the cytotoxic activity of LSEO might be due to the synergic effects of different terpenes in the oil, or perhaps there are some other active compounds responsible for the cytotoxic activity of the essential oil, which deserves attention in the future.
