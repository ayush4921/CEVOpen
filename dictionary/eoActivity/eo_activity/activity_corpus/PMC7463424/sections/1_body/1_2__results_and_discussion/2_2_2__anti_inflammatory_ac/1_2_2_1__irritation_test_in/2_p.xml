<p>The LSEO exhibited a membrane stabilization effect by inhibiting hypotonicity-induced lysis of HRBC membrane. This membrane is analogous to the lysosomal membrane and its stabilization implies that the LSEO may stabilize lysosomal membranes as well. Stabilization of lysosomal membrane is essential in decreasing the inflammatory reaction by stopping the discharge of lysosomal components of activated neutrophil such as bactericidal enzymes and proteases, which cause further tissue inflammation and destruction upon extracellular release [

Although the exact mechanism of the membrane stabilization by the LSEO extract is not known yet, hypotonicity-induced hemolysis may arise from shrinkage of the cells due to osmotic loss of intracellular electrolyte and fluid components. The LSEO may inhibit the processes, which may stimulate or enhance the efflux of these intracellular components [

 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-03671" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] have reported that the lavender EO presented RBC membrane stabilization action by preventing hypotonicity-induced lysis of erythrocyte membrane. Both the lavender EO and the positive control (NSAID) displayed anti-inflammatory activity, but the NSAID being more effective. Erythrocyte membrane stabilization is an important mechanism to inhibit the leakage of cellular constituents (protein and fluids) into the tissues during a time of increased penetrability initiated by inflammatory mediators.
