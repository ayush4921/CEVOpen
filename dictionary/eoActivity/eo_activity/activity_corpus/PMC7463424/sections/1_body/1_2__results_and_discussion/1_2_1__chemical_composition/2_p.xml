<p>Different constituents were detected and quantified, and 21 compounds were identified. The LSEO consisted mainly of oxygenated monoterpenes (79.23%) and low amounts of hydrocarbons (1.84%). Eucalyptol (1,8-cineole) was found to be the major component (61.36%), followed by β-pinene (13.83%) and α-pinene (4.75%). Other compounds were detected but were less than 3% (
