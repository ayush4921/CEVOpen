<p>Because anti-proliferative screening models in vitro provide important preliminary data to help select compounds with potential antineoplastic properties for further study, the LSEO was tested in vitro for its potential human tumor cell growth inhibitory effect on human breast carcinoma MDA-MB-231, human gastric cancer AGS, and human melanoma MV3, using MTT assay. This is a non-radioactive, fast, and economical assay widely used to quantify cell viability and proliferation. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03671-f003">Figure 3</xref>, LSEO had selective cytotoxicity on different tumor cells, and a potent anti-proliferative effect on AGS cells with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.035 ± 0.018 µL/mL. This potent in vitro antitumor effect was also shown in MV3 and MDA-MB-231 cell assays, with IC
 <sub>50</sub>s of 0.06 ± 0.022 µL/mL and 0.259 ± 0.089 µL/mL, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the anti-proliferative activity of LSEO.
