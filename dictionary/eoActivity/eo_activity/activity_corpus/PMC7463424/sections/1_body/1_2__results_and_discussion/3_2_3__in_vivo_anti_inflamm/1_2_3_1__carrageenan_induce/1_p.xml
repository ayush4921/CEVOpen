<p>Carrageenan-induced mice paw edema is often used to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of diverse natural bioactive compounds such as phytochemical extracts and EO. The anti-inflammatory activity of orally administered LSEO (2, 20, and 200 mg/kg) was determined using the same paw edema model. As shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-03671-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, in comparison with the NSAID indomethacin, LSEO exhibited a significantly high anti-inflammatory activity in a dose-dependent manner.
