<p>Our findings are in discordance with others carried out on

 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-03671" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] reported that 
 <italic>L. stoechas</italic> is rich in EO, and the principal compounds were fenchone (41%), 1,8-cineole (29%), and α-pinene (1.6%). Ristorcelli et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-03671" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] reported the chemical composition of the EOs from 50 samples of 
 <italic>L. stoechas</italic> from different areas of Corsica (France) during the flowering stage; they found important variations in the major constituents:  fenchone, 15–75%; camphor, 2–56%; and 1,8-cineole, 1–8%. The variations detected in LSEO between our research and others are surely related to the disparity in the area of collection. This may be explained by the influence of the external environment on the synthesis and regulation of secondary metabolism pathways in medicinal plants. In fact, the chemical composition of medicinal flora differs with phenological transformations, harvestings area, collected parts, and methods of distillation [
