<p>The results of in vitro anti-inflammatory activity determined by the human red blood cell membrane stabilization method were shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-03671-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The LSEO showed a concentration dependent anti-inflammatory activity, and the protection percent increased with an increase in the concentration of the samples. At a concentration of 3 µL/mL, the LSEO produced 74.471 ± 0.465% inhibition of human red blood cells (HRBC) hemolysis (

 <sub>50</sub> values, it is clear from the data that sodium diclofenac showed greater response than LSEO.
