<p>Denaturation of protein is a recognized source of inflammation. Therefore, as part of the examination to assess the anti-inflammatory mechanism of LSEO, its aptitude to inhibit BSA denaturation was calculated. The inhibitory action of different concentration of LSEO on BSA denaturation is shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-03671-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. It has been found that denaturation of BSA is inhibited by several NSAIDs such as indomethacin and salicylic acid, proving this assay to be useful in the detection of other anti-inflammatory compounds. It was detected from this assay that eucalyptol rich fraction of LSEO presented a dose-dependent maximum inhibition of denaturation of BSA of 72.625 ± 2.56% at 0.4 µL/mL and a standard NSAID (sodium diclofenac) revealed maximum inhibition of 76.117 ± 0.534% at the 0.01 mg/mL. On the basis of these results, LSEO showed significant anti-inflammatory activity (IC

 <sub>50</sub> = 8.260 ± 0.943 µL/mL), and suggests that LSEO has potential anti-inflammatory activity.
