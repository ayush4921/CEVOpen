<p>A previous investigation of another lavender species (
 <italic>L. angustifolia</italic>) EO showed cytotoxicity to human skin cells in vitro at a concentration of 0.25% (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-03671" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. As we did not evaluate the cytotoxic effect of all chemicals present in LSEO against the three cancer cell lines, it is not possible to identify which of these compounds are responsible for the observed results. It appears from this analysis that EOs containing a high amount of eucalyptol are more cytotoxic than the others [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-25-03671" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. These results are in agreement with those of other authors who reported that the eucalyptol (1,8-cineole) has an important antitumor effect against tumor cell lines like hormone-refractory prostate cancer [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-25-03671" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and drug-resistant human lung cancer [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-25-03671" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Specific induction of apoptosis, not necrosis, was observed in human colon cancer cell lines HCT116 and RKO by 1,8-cineole. The treatment with 1,8-cineole was associated with inactivation of survivin and Akt and activation of p38. These molecules induced cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and caspase-3, finally causing apoptosis. In xeno-transplanted SCID mice, the 1,8-cineole group showed significantly inhibited tumor progression compared to a control group [

 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-03671" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] studied the cytotoxicity and the mechanisms of cell death induced by the EO of 
 <italic>Lavandula angustifolia</italic>, and were compared with both normal (human fibroblast cells) and malignant cancerous human cells (HeLa Human cervix carcinoma and MCF-7 lung adenocarcinoma cell lines). They found that the IC
 <sub>50</sub> for normal cells was higher (&gt;500 µg/mL) than that reported with cancer cell lines (IC
 <sub>50</sub> HeLa = 31.92 µg/mL; IC
 <sub>50</sub> HeLa = 31.92 µg/mL); thus, confirming a higher sensitivity of tumor cells as compared to normal cells.
