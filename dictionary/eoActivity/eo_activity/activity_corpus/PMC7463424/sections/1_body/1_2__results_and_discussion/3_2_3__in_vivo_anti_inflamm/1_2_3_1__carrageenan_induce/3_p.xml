<p>Inflammatory illnesses are presently treated with steroidal and NSAIDs. Unfortunately, both of these widely prescribed treatment classes have important harmful side effects and fail in certain segments of the population [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-03671" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Therefore, there is a need to develop and produce new treatments with novel mechanisms of action that do not generate significant side effects. It has been reported that a variety of EOs exhibit noticeable anti-inflammatory properties in numerous diverse models of inflammation. Investigations on the anti-inflammatory action of LSEO are limited. Only one research report suggested the aptitude of

 <xref rid="B12-molecules-25-03671" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The precise mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the LSEO is unclear. Nevertheless, it has been reported that a number of constituents contribute to the incomplete reduction of the release of inflammation mediators. In recent years, numerous studies have reported oxygenated mono- and sesquiterpenes and their hydrocarbon derivatives as the main compounds of EOs, which have effective anti-inflammatory activity [

 <xref rid="B26-molecules-25-03671" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In our study, 1,8-cineole (eucalyptol) has been found to be the major compound in LSEO. It appears that 1,8-cineole can be partially linked with the observed pharmacological activity, but it is not apparent if the other oxygenated monoterpenes (fenchone, pinene) can also potentiate this effect. Our results are in agreement with those published for other EOs rich in 1,8-cineole that demonstrated a potent and strong anti-edematogenic effect [

 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-03671" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. They revealed that the EOs, which are rich in 1,8-cineole, showed analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. Eucalyptol also exhibits an inhibitory effect in a number of tests of experimental inflammation in animals, using the carrageenan-induced paw edema test [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-25-03671" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. These activities may be linked with the aptitude of eucalyptol to suppress the arachidonic acid metabolism and cytokine production in human monocytes [
