<p>We investigated H&amp;E-stained ear sections from xylene-induced animals (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03671-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Xylene is a highly irritating substance that stimulated an inflammatory response in the epidermis. Xylene application resulted in a noticeable increase in ear thickness with obvious confirmation of edema, epidermal hyperplasia, and inflammatory cell infiltration in the dermis with associated connective tissue disruption (
