<p>In comparison with positive control (diclofenac topical gel), LSEO exhibited a powerful and effective anti-inflammatory activity in our experimental animal model. Diclofenac gel (Voltarène emulgène
 <sup>®</sup> 1%) produced 15.17% inhibition of xylene-induced edema, and this effect was statistically different and lower (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) than that observed with all tested doses of LSEO. Further, LSEO reduced the inflammatory response by 80.1% for 410 mg/kg, which is higher than the positive control (Betasone) (70.3%). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to prove that LSEO has a significant topical anti-inflammatory activity in vivo. Consistent with current data, our previous report [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-03671" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] showed that topical application of EOs can limit the inflammatory symptoms of edema and neutrophil accumulation. In phytotherapy, dermal application of EOs in a full body massage or to limited parts of the body is greatly pleasing. Many EOs are used as curative ingredients for inflammatory indications with lesional neutrophil accumulation: aphthous stomatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and lesional fungal or bacterial contagions [
