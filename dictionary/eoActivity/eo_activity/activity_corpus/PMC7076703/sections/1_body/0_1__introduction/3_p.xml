<p>Given the excessive consumption of chemical fertilizers and the resulting contamination of groundwater and soil salinization, the use of nano-fertilizers is highly efficient. Rawat et al. revealed that nano-sized fertilizers have the potential to be employed as a plant growth promoter and can enhance plant gas exchange and root efficiency [

Research has shown that soils have a deficiency in macroelements, especially nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), and these are more commonly found as components of commercial fertilizers, compared to the other essential elements [

Basically, in the arid and semi-arid climates of Iran, the majority of farmers apply different types of Fe chelates, however, their use is still in question. Nanoparticles are assumed to be one of the best choices for these areas. The effect of nano Fe chelated on growth and development of medicinal plants and herbs has been widely studied. But all aspects of plant responses to iron nanoparticles are still unclear [
