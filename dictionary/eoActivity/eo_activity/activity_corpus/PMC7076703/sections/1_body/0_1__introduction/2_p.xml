<p>The family Lamiaceae is one of the biggest and most famous plant families, with high biodiversity around the world. The medicinal and aromatic members of this family are regarded as a key genetic reserve of plants due to their high ecological adaptability with diverse climates. Also, because of their aromatic compounds, they are widely used in the cosmetic, health, medicinal, and food industries [

Sowing season mostly affects the length of the vegetative and reproduction phase, crop harvest, yield, and quality. Sowing season and time due to its relationship with day length, temperature, and relative humidity have a great impact on the quality and yield components of plants. Sowing season is one of the most important management factors (controlling the damage of pests, diseases, weeds, and cold temperatures, etc.) for producing a high value product [
 <xref rid="B6-plants-09-00252" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The selection of sowing season is influential in controlling the damage of pests, diseases, weeds, and cold temperatures, and matches the plant’s growth period, especially in sensitive development phases like flowering, with suitable temperatures [
