<p>The study was carried out as a factorial experiment based on a randomized complete block design with three replications. The factors included sowing season at two levels (winter and spring) and fertilizer source at six levels (control, incorporated NPK-s, NPK-n, Fe-chelated-n, NPK-n + Fe-chelated-n, and incorporated NPK-s + NPK-n + Fe-chelated-n, where n-nano fertilizer, s-standard fertilizer. The characteristics of Nano Fertilizers provided by the Khazra company were as follows: 9% Chelated Nano Iron: contains 9% chelated and absorbable iron for the plant in pH 3 to 11, is fully soluble in water and designed according to advanced chelate technology. NPK Nanoâ€”Fertilizer 20-20-20: powder, fully soluble in water and usable as spraying solution with a ratio of two per one thousand, and is environmentally friendly.</p>
