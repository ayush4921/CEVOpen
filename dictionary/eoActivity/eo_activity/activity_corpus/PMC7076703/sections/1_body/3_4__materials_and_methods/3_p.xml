<p>The seeds were collected from a local landrace in the south of Western Azerbaijan Province. The blocks were developed on the farm on 27 November 2017. After autumn plowing and land leveling, the sowing rows were created. The experimental plots were set at 6 m
 <sup>2</sup>. The winter sowing was performed on 28 November 2017 by the row sowing technique. On-row spacing was set at 1 cm and between-row spacing at 25 cm. The spring sowing was conducted on 27 February 2018. The thinning, gap-filling, and weeding operations were performed conventionally during the growing season. To determine the morphological traits at the harvest time, ten plants were randomly harvested from each plot to assess these traits. To estimate the yield, two side rows and 0.5 m from both ends of the plots were eliminated as the marginal effect. On 3 June 2018 plants reached their physiological maturity. Seed yield per plant was determined on ten plants randomly selected from each plot at physiological maturity.
