<p>Nano complex of Fe could increase antioxidant activity in 
 <italic>Portulaca oleracea.</italic> These nutrients play a key role in cellular mechanisms, osmotic regulation, and enzyme synthesis, and provide a large number of biochemical constitutions for many metabolic pathways, to improve plant quality and quantity [

There is a direct relationship between phenol compounds and DPPH radical scavenging activity, so that when the phenol compound content is increased, DPPH radicals are scavenged at a faster pace. The purple-colored DPPH acts as an oxidizer in oxidation and reduction reactions. DPPH free radicals are mainly composed of stable nitrogen and can be used to specify the scavenging of free radicals through antioxidant activities [

 <italic>Echinacea angustifolia</italic> increased root volume compared to its spring-sown counterparts, and the measurement of antioxidant activity with DPPH showed the increased antioxidant capacity of the plants [
 <xref rid="B42-plants-09-00252" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Similarly, we observed that the sowing season was effective in 
 <italic>L. iberica</italic>â€™s capacity to improve DPPH radical suppression and increase antioxidant activity. Antioxidant capacity of the fruit extract of apricot and 
 <italic>Cassia fistula</italic> was measured at different rates of Au, Ag and ZnO nano fertilizers. Based on the results of the color change mechanism, free radical reduction, and electron transfer, DPPH radical suppression was higher at higher fertilizer levels [

 <xref rid="B45-plants-09-00252" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Consequently, antioxidant capacity was improved. Likewise, the application of fertilizers improved DPPH radical suppression capacity of 
 <italic>L. iberica</italic> in our study. This capacity was better in leaf extract of the winter-sown plants treated with NPK-n + Fe-chelated-n, so it is recommended to use a combination of these two treatments to gain quality of yield. Nanoparticles stimulate plant antioxidant defense by oxidative stress through interaction with the cell membrane, as well as biomolecules [
 <xref rid="B46-plants-09-00252" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Chandra et al. described that tea leaves treated with nanoparticles displayed higher activity of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant defense parameters such as peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and phenol content [
