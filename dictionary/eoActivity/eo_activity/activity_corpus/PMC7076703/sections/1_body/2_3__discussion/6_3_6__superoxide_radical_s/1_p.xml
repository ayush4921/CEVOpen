<p>According to Motlagh et al. [
 <xref rid="B57-plants-09-00252" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] the sowing date had a significant effect on the antioxidant properties of roselle by influencing the length of different vegetative and reproductive growth phases and growing degree days [
 <xref rid="B57-plants-09-00252" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. As a result of the phenol content of the seed extract, hydrogen peroxide radical scavenging activity was increased. The synthesis of secondary metabolites and antioxidant capacity can be enhanced by substrate nutrient management and manipulation of environmental conditions [

 <xref rid="B61-plants-09-00252" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Trace elements like Fe, Zn, Cu, Mg, and Mn play a significant role as cofactors in the structure of a group of antioxidants, so their deficiency reduces the activities of antioxidants [

 <xref rid="B62-plants-09-00252" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,
 <xref rid="B63-plants-09-00252" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. However, the seed extract exhibited higher hydrogen peroxide radical scavenging activity due to its higher phenol content. The results proved the superiority of winter sowing and incorporated NPK-s + NPK-n + Fe-chelated-n, but this fertilization regime did not differ from NPK-n + Fe-chelated-n significantly, so it is more cost-effective to apply the latter regime and eliminate soil-incorporated NPK-s.
