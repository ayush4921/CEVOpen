<p>Previous research has established that when plants are sown early (in winter), the variations in day length and relative diurnal temperature regime provides better conditions for the growth and establishment of more vigorous plants. As such, their seed yield is enhanced. Also, their spring growth starts earlier and the period from sowing to flowering is shortened, avoiding the coincidence of a seed filling period with high environmental temperatures, lower plant height, and the loss of seed yield [

So, our results suggest it is enough to apply NPK-n + Fe-chelated-n, and soil-incorporated NPK can be eliminated. The spring-sown plants failed to produce as high a yield as the control treatment of the winter sowing, even when they were treated with fertilizers. So, it is recommended to sow 
 <italic>L. iberica</italic> in winter.
