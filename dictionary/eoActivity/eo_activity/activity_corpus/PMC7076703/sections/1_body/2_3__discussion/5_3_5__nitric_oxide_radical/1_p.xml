<p>Treatments that showed higher suppression capacity in winter sowing performed moderately in spring sowing, revealing the impact of the sowing season. Nitric oxide radical suppression is directly related to phenol compounds of the plant. These compounds are a function of process, genotype, harvest date, growth conditions, and nutrition. Thus, the change in phenolic concentration changes nitric oxide radical suppression percentage. As such, research on the effect of harvest time on the antioxidant properties of licorice showed that the roots of the plants harvested in October had higher free radical suppression capacity, reducing capacity, and anti-oxidant capacity than those harvested in January [

They have the ability to interfere with the process of free radical generation and act as metal chelators by stimulating antioxidant enzymes [

Pourakbar and Adlifard assessed total antioxidant activity, total phenol content, and total flavonoid content of different parts of grape (leaf, unripe grape, raisin, and syrup) and reported that leaves had higher total phenol and flavonoid content than unripe fruits, ripe fruits, dry fruits, and syrup, so they had the highest DPPH, superoxide, and nitric acid scavenging capacity and the highest capacity to suppress lipid peroxidation [

Between the two seasons studied, winter sowing performed better and the effect of soil-incorporated NPK-n + NPK-n + Fe-chelated-n was remarkable, but did not differ significantly from NPK-n + Fe-chelated-n. Nano particles are tiny in size, which gives them unique physical and chemical properties with ultra-high absorption. They are able to hold abundant ions because of their high surface area, and slowly release them in appropriate time in accordance with crop demand that results in plant photosynthesis and growth enhancement [
