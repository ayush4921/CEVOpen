<p>Flavonoids are a large group of phenol compounds in plants that inhibit lipid oxidation by scavenging free radicals and/or mechanisms for extinguishing singlet oxygen [

It was reported in the literature that the sowing dates of October and March increased quantitative and qualitative yields of intercropped peppermint and fenugreek (essential oil, phenol, flavonoid, and antioxidant capacity) as compared to plants sown in May, because flavonoids are secondary metabolites that are influenced by environmental conditions including sowing date [
 <xref rid="B36-plants-09-00252" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], a fact that was also observed in our study. The effect of nano P fertilizer, salicylic acid, and foliar application of macro NPK fertilizers was also found to be significant on flavonoid compounds of garden sage and two olive cultivars [

 <xref rid="B38-plants-09-00252" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Total flavonoid content and antioxidant activity were higher in leaf extract than in stem extract. Also, total flavonoid content was the highest during flowering and then during seed-setting periods. These differences were observed between leaves and seeds in our experiment, reflecting significant differences in the quantity and quality of antioxidant and phytochemical properties in different plant parts [
