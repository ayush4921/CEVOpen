<p>Thus far a number of studies have demonstrated that the chemical composition of essential oils varies with geographical location, growing region, soil type, climate, altitude from sea level, and water availability. Even season, e.g., before or after flowering and the hour at which setting is done, affects the chemical composition of essential oils [

 <italic>L. iberica</italic> essential oils were influenced by genotype, but climatic conditions and the interactive effect of plant and environmental conditions also influenced this trait [

 <italic>L. iberica</italic> and the production of more essential oil are in agreement with that previously reported about chamomile, 
 <italic>Dracocephalum moldavica</italic> L., and fennel [

The interaction of sowing season and N-containing nano fertilizer improved essential oil yield of safflower. Likewise, the application of micronutrients like Fe and the integrated use of nano P and K fertilizer and vermicompost increased essential oil percentage and yield of mint and savory [

 <xref rid="B26-plants-09-00252" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We found that incorporated NPK-s + NPK-n + Fe-chelated-n had an effect similar to NPK-n + Fe-chelated-n in increasing the number of essential oil-producing glands. Hence, it is recommended to eliminate incorporated NPK-s and consume only NPK-n + Fe-chelated-n with winter sowing.
