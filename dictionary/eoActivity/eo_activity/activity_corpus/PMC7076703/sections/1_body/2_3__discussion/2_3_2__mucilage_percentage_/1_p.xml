<p>Previous studies have indicated that 
 <italic>Psyllium</italic> and 
 <italic>L. iberica</italic> sown in February have a longer growth period than those sown in March, so they are in a better place to synthesize seed components, especially mucilage [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-09-00252" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. As such, it was found that delayed sowing reduced seed yield and mucilage yield since the growth period was shortened and the flowering and seed filling periods coincided with hot summer temperatures [
 <xref rid="B15-plants-09-00252" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The mucilage percentage of 
 <italic>L. iberica</italic> was increased in winter sowing treated with NPK fertilizer and the simultaneous application of P and N influenced mucilage yield [

 <xref rid="B17-plants-09-00252" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In a study on 
 <italic>Psyllium</italic>, Ramrudi and co-workers reported that the foliar application of micronutrients enhanced mucilage yield significant compared to the control [
 <xref rid="B18-plants-09-00252" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Likewise, some researchers have attributed the higher seed and mucilage yield of psyllium to the application of fertilizers. Thus, it was shown that the higher mucilage yield was associated with the higher seed yield and mucilage percentage under the influence of optimal sowing season and fertilizer treatment. It is therefore recommended to use winter sowing and apply NPK-n + Fe-chelated-n in order to achieve the highest mucilage percentage and yield at lower costs.
