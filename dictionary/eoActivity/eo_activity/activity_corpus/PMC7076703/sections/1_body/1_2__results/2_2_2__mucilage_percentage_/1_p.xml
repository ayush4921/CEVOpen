<p>Based on the results of analysis of variance (ANOVA), the simple effects of sowing season and nano fertilizers had significant (

The comparison of means indicated that the highest mucilage percentage was related to the incorporated NPK-s + NPK-n + Fe-chelated-n fertilizer (16.66%) and winter sowing (15.05%), and the lowest was obtained from the control (11.14%) and spring sowing (13.9%,

ANOVA revealed significant differences in mucilage yield, as influenced by the interactive effect of sowing season and nano fertilizers. According to the comparison of means, the highest mucilage yield was 348.49 kg, obtained from the plants sown in winter and fertilized with NPK-n + Fe-chelated-n, and the lowest was 61.00 kg, obtained from the control spring-sown plants (
