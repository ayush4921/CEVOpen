<p>The nitric oxide (NO) radical suppression results for the seed extract of 
 <italic>L. iberica</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00252-f007">Figure 7</xref>A) showed that the highest NO suppression percentage (46.34%) was obtained from the winter-sown plants fertilized with incorporated NPK-s + NPK-n + Fe-chelated-n and the lowest (24.12%) from the control spring-sown plants. At lower rates, the seed extract of 
 <italic>L. iberica</italic> had a weaker nitric oxide radical scavenging rate, which increased with the increase in extract concentration. The statistical analysis of NO scavenging percentage in the leaf extract revealed that the winter-sown plants treated with incorporated NPK-s + NPK-n + Fe-chelatedâ€“n had the highest (44.88%) and the control spring-sown plants had the lowest (22.9%) (
