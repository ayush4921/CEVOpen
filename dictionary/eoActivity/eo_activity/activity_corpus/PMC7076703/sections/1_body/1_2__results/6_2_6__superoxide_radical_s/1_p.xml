<p>Based on the results of the statistical examination of the superoxide radical suppression capacity of seed extract (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00252-f008">Figure 8</xref>A), the two factors of sowing season and fertilizer choice separately influenced this trait significantly. The highest superoxide radical suppression capacity of 40.41% was related to the treatment of incorporated NPK-s + NPK-n + Fe-chelated-n and the lowest of 33.44% to the control. It was also 41.3% for winter sowing and 33.6% for spring sowing. Similarly, the examination of this trait in leaf extract indicated that incorporated NPK-s + NPK-n + Fe-chelated-n and control had the highest and lowest capacities of 49.08% and 40.88%, respectively. Also, winter sowing and spring sowing exhibited capacities of 50.55% and 42.09%, respectively (
