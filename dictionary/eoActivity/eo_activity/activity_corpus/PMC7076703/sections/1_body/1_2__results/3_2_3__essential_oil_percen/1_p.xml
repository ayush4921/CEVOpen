<p>The results of ANOVA showed that the interactive effect of sowing season and nano fertilizers was significant on the essential oil percentage of 
 <italic>L. iberica</italic>. According to the comparison of means, the highest essential oil percentage (0.194) was obtained from the interaction of soil-incorporated NPK-s + n-NPK-n + Fe-chelated-n and winter sowing and the lowest (0.11) from the interaction of control and spring sowing (

Essential oil yield was also significantly influenced by the interaction of sowing season and fertilizer, so that the highest essential oil yield of 3.24 mg/ha was related to the interaction of soil-incorporated NPK-s + NPK-n + Fe-chelated-n fertilizer and winter sowing, and the lowest (0.62 mg ha
 <sup>âˆ’1</sup>) was related to spring sowing (
