<p>The statistical examination of total flavonoid content (TFC) of the seed extract indicated that the interaction of incorporated NPK-s + NPK-n + Fe-chelated-n and winter sowing was related to the highest total flavonoid content of 1.40 mg quercetin equivalent (QE) per g DM and the interaction of the control and spring sowing was related to the lowest one of 0.64 mg QE g
 <sup>−1</sup> DM (

 <sup>−1</sup>, and the spring-sown control plants had the lowest, 1.03 mg g
