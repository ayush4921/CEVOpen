<p>The statistical analysis of total phenols content (TPC) of the seed extract of 
 <italic>L. iberica</italic> showed the highest phenol content was 23.02 mg gallic acid (GAE) per g dry matter (DM) related to the interaction of NPK-n + Fe-chelated-n and winter sowing and the lowest was 10.43 mg GAE g
 <sup>−1</sup> DM related to the interaction of the control and spring sowing (

 <sup>−1</sup> DM) was measured in the winter-sown plants treated within corporated NPK-s + NPK-n + Fe-chelated-n and the lowest (3.85 mg GAE g
 <sup>−1</sup> DM) in the spring-sown plants that were not treated with any fertilizers (
