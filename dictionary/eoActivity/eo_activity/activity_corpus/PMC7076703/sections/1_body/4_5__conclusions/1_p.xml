<p>The results showed that winter sowing outperformed spring sowing in terms of most quantitative and qualitative traits of 
 <italic>L. iberica</italic>, owing to the better establishment in soil and more optimal use of environmental conditions. Also, the results for the nutrition of the plants by fertilizer regimes revealed that incorporated NPK-s + NPK-n + Fe-chelated-n was the most effective in influencing the quantitative and qualitative traits, but it did not show significant differences to NPK-n + Fe-chelated-n in most recorded traits. So, NPK-n + Fe-chelated-n can be presented as the best fertilization treatment for winter sowing, which will contribute to achieving the goals of sustainable agriculture, as incorporated NPK-s is eliminated.
