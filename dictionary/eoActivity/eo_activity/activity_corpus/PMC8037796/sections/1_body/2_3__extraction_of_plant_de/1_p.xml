<p>Mucilage can be extracted from any part of the plant is considered a valuable natural polysaccharides source with excellent potential in pharmaceutical and food applications. several studies said that the yield, functional, and rheological properties of mucilage are highly dependent on the extraction method and extraction conditions [
 <xref rid="B28-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Generally, all the extraction method of mucilage comprises of two successive procedures which are maceration and precipitation. Usually, the maceration extraction method of mucilage is simple and valuable, although the disadvantage of maceration is low efficiency and long extraction time [
 <xref rid="B33-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This method consists of soaking the raw material in the chosen solvent at room temperature with regular agitation. maceration for extraction of mucilage is typically done using the low ratio of solid-liquid and hot water treatment. acid solutions, ammonium oxalate, and EDTA are also used to improve mucilage extraction [
 <xref rid="B26-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. According to several studies, the water-extracted mucilage showed high viscosity than alkali and acid-extracted mucilage due to marked differences in the mucilage structure of monosaccharides. However, the limitations of these methods are higher levels of protein with low yields of mucilage and subsequent denaturation. Apart from its nutritional value, protein is known as an impurity in the final product which affects its purity and restricts its industrial use due to the instability and undesirable taste caused by microbial spoilage. while protein presence in the mucilage has been identified regardless of the extraction methods used and an emulsifying action has been taken to demonstrate that protein is desirable to improve the texture and consistency of emulsions and beverages [
 <xref rid="B34-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The general outline revealed an increase in protein levels as time and temperature of maceration increased, resulting in a higher molecular weight of mucilage. Also, higher maceration temperature and extended stirring period contributed to highly colored mucilage, which is unacceptable for industrial usage. Acid pre-treatment should be considered in order to protect against this color effect [
 <xref rid="B35-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Solvent treatment is a conventional extraction technique of mucilage. generally, the aqueous procedure included the mucilage extracted from the dry parts of the plant (seeds, leaves, roots, stems) by using hot distilled water. The procedure occurs under continuous shaking and stirring of solution. The solution is then filtered, these stages can be repeated often. Consequently, the mucilage is precipitated by the addition of alcohol to the filtrate. Then, precipitated mucilage is dried via freeze-drying or in an oven to obtaining the final mucilage powder [
 <xref rid="B29-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] whereas ultrasonication treatment is a emerging non-thermal technique for mucilage extraction with several applications in the pharmaceutical and food industry. Furthermore, in some plant parts, two layers of mucilage (Arabidopsis seed coating) make the extraction process very difficult; therefore, ultrasonication treatment can be much helpful in such cases. The outer layer of the seed coat can be extracted through shaking, and an inner layer of the seed coat is composed of rhamnogalacturonan I, which is a very difficult challenge to extract. in this case, ultrasonic treatment for 20 s showed excellent results. ultrasound with low-frequency has been used for mucilage extraction by disrupting the biological cell wall through the formation of pores. The formation of cavitation bubbles and their resulting collapse produce high spots with higher pressure and temperature, capable of breaking the bonds between the mucilage and seed coat. As a result, the amplitude of the ultrasounds, extraction temperature, and time must all be selected carefully to prevent the extraction of undesirable compounds and mechanical disturbance of the seeds [

Likewise, microwave is a thermal emerging extraction method that can be used for the extraction of mucilage from several parts of the plant. Moreover, microwave-assisted extraction is a potential alternative method providing advantages in terms of improved extraction efficiency, reduced solvent consumption, and time reduction. Conventional aqueous extraction methods include the effects of solvent, pH, and temperature, which change the nutritional value, functional and structural property of mucilage [
 <xref rid="B37-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Using hot water extraction with a long extraction period is considered to be cost-effective, although it can reduce the consistency of the mucilage. Several studies said that conventional hot water extraction methods result in the loss of heat liable compounds of mucilage, to overcome this major drawback, microwave-assisted extraction with extraction at 300 to 400 W for 120 to180 s was used, resulting in a high mucilage yield. Consequently, enzymes also play a very crucial role in the extraction process due to their wide range of applications in the food industry. During the enzymatic hydrolysis for reduction of viscosity and molecular weight of mucilage, several enzymes can be used such as rhamnase, arabinase, xylanse, and mannonase [
 <xref rid="B13-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Furthermore, cold extraction can be applied in order to produce more viscous mucilage, which is more natural but with a lower yield compared to the hot extraction method [
 <xref rid="B38-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Moreover, an increase in the ratio of solid-liquid is proportional to more yield due to more availability of solvents, which improves the driving force of mucilage from raw plant material. However, the high ratio of solid-liquid cannot significantly affect mucilage yield, also consisting of high process costs. In this context, Elboutachfaiti et al. [
 <xref rid="B37-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] extracted mucilage from flaxseed mucilage after maceration in hot water, six rhamnogalacturonan fractions of flaxseed mucilage were extracted and purified by using ion-exchange chromatography. As regards the pH effect on the extraction yield of mucilage, a significant increase in the yield of mucilage was observed with an increase in pH due to the separation of the acidic groups such as uranic acids, and due to the attraction between the negatively charged ones, which increased the solubility of the mucilage, although further decreased after a certain pH value. Moreover, lower pH values of mucilage are likely to improve protein recovery due to protein solubilization. Although, below 3 pH, the action of acid can result in a lower protein yield due to its hydrolysis [
