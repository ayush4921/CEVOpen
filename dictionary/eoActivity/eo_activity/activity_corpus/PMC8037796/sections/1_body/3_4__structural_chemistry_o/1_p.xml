<p>The mucilage is a water-soluble component constituting different functional chemical components with potential human health benefits [
 <xref rid="B41-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Mucilage and gum are a subgroup of hydrocolloids containing monosaccharides linked with organic acids and are close to each other due to the hydrophilic and hydrocolloid components that create a sticky solution or gel in the presence of water [
 <xref rid="B2-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Plant hydrocolloids (Gum and mucilage) contain pentose, galactose and methyl pentose sugar joined to uranic acid residues by glycosidic linkages. The terminal atom of carbon (at the opposite side of the carbonyl chain) of the monosaccharide unit may occur in an oxidized (carboxylic acid) form. Six carbon with aldohexose in the form of a carboxylic acid is termed uranic acid [

Furthermore, Monosaccharides are the most common carbohydrate molecules that cannot be broken down into simpler sugar molecules by hydrolysis and are occasionally referred to as simple sugars. Mucilage present in plant consists of two main polysaccharides pectin and hemicellulose each of which is comprised of rhamnogalacturonan, and arabinoxylans respectively [

 <xref rid="B43-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Moreover, there is some evidence that rhamnogalacturonan I side chains can be covalently bound to hemicelluloses, creating a super-macromolecular polymeric network. The neutral sugars are mainly D-xylose, L-arabinose, and D-galactose, with the proportions and types of neutral sugars varying with the origin of mucilage. In mucilage, both carboxyl and hydroxyl groups are present as functional groups due to the presence of these functional groups it acts as a polyelectrolyte [
