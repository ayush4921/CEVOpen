 <xref rid="B47-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] observed that basil seed mucilage contains xylan (24.29%), glucan (2.31%), and glucomannan (43%), chia seed contains glucose (19.6%), galactose (6.1%), arabinose (9.6%), xylose (38.5%), galacturonic acid (5.3%), and glucuronic acid (18.7%), cress seed mucilage contains glucose (1%), fructose (6.8%), arabinose (19.4%) rhamnose (1.9%), glucuronic acid (6.7%), and galactose (4.7%), and flaxseed contains xylose (21.1–37.4%), fructose (5–7.1%), galactose (20–28%), and arabinose (9.2–13.5%) [
 <xref rid="B17-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. All these studies conclude that mucilage present in the seeds coat of plants of different species exhibits different forms of carbohydrates and uranic acid units.
