<p>Rheological characterization is used to determine the shear rate-dependent flow behavior of the mucilage solutions, and is generally examined over a shear rate range of 0 to 100 Hz. The rheological characterization of the mucilage of seeds from different plants was performed by several scientists. In this context, Punia et al. [
 <xref rid="B56-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] measured the rheological characteristics of the mucilage of chia seeds by an oscillatory shear (range of frequency stress sweep is about 1 Hz to 10 Hz) and revealed the highest correlation coefficient of chia seed (R
 <sup>2</sup> &gt; 98.58) and with the increase in shear rate, they observed a rapid decrease in the viscosity of the solution. In another study by Capitain et al. [
 <xref rid="B57-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] it was observed that the chia seed dispersions viscosity increases by increasing the concentration from a range of 0.25 to 1.00 (
 <italic>w/v</italic>). Likewise, Abbastabar et al. [
 <xref rid="B58-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] characterized quince seed mucilage and observed curve turned from the linear range at strain 11.4%. Increases of storage modulus and decrease of viscoelastic linear range (7.7%) were observed in the presence of 0.2 M NaCl as NaCl shows its dual behavior on the mucilage or gum. Quince seed mucilage has high activation energy which is about 6988.74 J mol
 <sup>1</sup>. activation energy is usually used to determine the chain flexibility of biopolymers. Keshani-Dokht et al. [
 <xref rid="B59-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] in their study observed a decrease in the magnitude of 
 <italic>Cordia myxa</italic> mucilage and an increase in solution concentration from 0.99 to 0.89 and 0.2–2% respectively. In their study, they observed that the mucilage solution has a tendency of more shear thinning at a high concentration level. The activation energy of 
 <italic>Cordia myxa</italic> mucilage was calculated at about 446.23 KJ. The thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) technique is used for measuring the mass variation in a particular mucilage-containing sample as a function of temperature in a stable atmosphere [
 <xref rid="B53-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The vibration of mass can be negative when the part of the sample is transformed in vapor and that can be positive when the sample is subjected to corrosion or oxidation [
 <xref rid="B60-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The thermal stability of mucilage can be measured in two conditions such as isothermal (temperature is kept constant) and dynamic (temperature is increased at a linear rate) [
 <xref rid="B6-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Thermal stability and thermal behavior of 
 <italic>Manilkara zapota</italic> (Linn.) Seed mucilage data showed that heating at 10 °C /min from 0 °C to a maximum of 900 °C resulted in two mass loss events according to the derivative thermograms and primary thermograms. Furthermore, there was 41.17% weight loss at 178.6–359.7 °C temperature range in the first Decomposition stage and 30.06% weight loss at 359.7–600.6 °C in the second Decomposition stage. Besides, at the same temperature range the enthalpy (315.8729 and 3624.787 J/g), DTG peak (350.3 °C and 614.4 °C), and heat change (138.4354 and 1082.215 μVs/mg) were observed for both first and second decomposition stages [
 <xref rid="B61-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) has emerged as an excellent physical technique to investigated physical and chemical or exothermic and endothermic changes that occur in the mucilage during thermal processing [
 <xref rid="B62-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The high thermo-stable property of mucilage can be utilized in paints for stabilizing suspensions or emulsions, improve bake-stability in cakes, preventing crystal growth, and improving freeze-thaw stability [
 <xref rid="B6-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The outcome of the DSC analysis of 
 <italic>Diospyros melonoxylon</italic> Roxb seed mucilage discovered the glass transition temperature is 78 °C. the high intense peak was observed in Differential scanning calorimetry thermograms at around 200 °C which was an endothermic transition. The large endothermic peak correlates to the hydrophilic nature of the functional groups of chia seed mucilage and can be due to in regular packing structure of the gums [
 <xref rid="B63-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The endothermic peak transition temperatures (Te, To, Tp) of chia seed mucilage were 215 °C, 52.8 °C, and 107.9 °C, respectively. 233.9 J/g was enthalpy change value of chia seed mucilage. In the case of exothermic peak transition temperatures (Te, To, Tp) of chia seed mucilage were 354.9 °C, 277.7 °C, and 316.8 °C, respectively, and the enthalpy value of exothermic peak (101.9 J/g) was lower than endothermic. The high enthalpy value of mucilage indicates high energy needed in releasing water-related with the loss of crystallization as well as hydrogel bounded [
