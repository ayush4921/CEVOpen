<p>The Mucilage is a water-soluble edible adhesive material that constitutes carbohydrates and uranic acids units present in different parts of plants including the mucous epidermis of the outer layer of seeds, bark, leaves, and buds [
 <xref rid="B18-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The majority of plants produce mucilage from the seed coat and this process of producing mucilage is termed Myxospermy and some plant species produce it from the fruit epicarp which is known as Myxocarpy. Plants producing mucilage from seed coat belong to the family 
 <italic>Plantaginaceae, Acanthaceae, Linaceae,</italic> and 
 <italic>Brassicaceae</italic>, while Myxocarpy (fruit mucilage) is commonly found in families like 
 <italic>Poaceae, Asteraceae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Lamiaceae</italic> [

The presence of mucilage on the seed coat prevents the plant from early seedling development and drought stress during the germination. depending upon its origin it is characterized into many groups including hair secretion, intracellular mucilage, and cell membrane mucilage [
 <xref rid="B11-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The mucilage obtained from the seed coat is classified into three classes that are endosperm non-starch polysaccharide (galactomannans), cell wall material of the endosperm (soybean hemicelluloses and xyloglucans), and mucilaginous constituents of the seed coat (flaxseed, Chia seed, and yellow mustard) [

 <xref rid="B21-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Mucilage develops a jelly-like structure around fruit and maintains moisture and prevents seeds from completely drying out and therefore act as a hydrating agent and also acts as an energy reservoir [

Mucilage also plays a significant role in the control of germination, the promotion of dispersal, and soil adhesion, root mucilage is usually exhibited from the outer layers of the root cap, consisting of mostly root border cells and polysaccharides, which produce various chemical substances such as flavonoids, phenolics acids, amino acids, galactosidase, antibiotics, sugars, peroxidase, proteins, and anthocyanins [
 <xref rid="B24-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Moreover, root mucilage plays a very important role for plant growth, such as for the maintenance of root-to-soil touch, root tip lubrication, soil microaggregate stabilization, water storage ability, selective storage, and the absorption of ions (Na
 <sup>+</sup>, Cd
 <sup>2+</sup>, Pb
 <sup>2+</sup>, and Al
 <sup>3+</sup>) through root cells. Furthermore, it is primarily secreted by the secretory vesicles of hypersecretory root cap cells as a coagulated polysaccharide (poly-galacturonic acid) and is subsequently passed during root extension to older root areas, but epidermal cells are also effective in secreting mucilage [

 <xref rid="B27-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Mucilage is also produced in the leaves and buds of several plant species; it may allow the leaves to retain water capacity when soil water deficits emerge; therefore, it helps in the storage of food and water. Various mucilage containing plants and their origins are highlighted in
