<p>Mucilage derived from plants can enhance the shelf life, storage capacity and also reduce the loss of moisture, therefore, extensively used as an edible coating in food packaging industries [
 <xref rid="B95-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. The mucilage has high tensile strength and barrier properties against different gases which reduce the firmness and weight loss of coated products [
 <xref rid="B96-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. Several studies have been conducted to check the effect of mucilage obtained from seeds of plants by different scientists [
 <xref rid="B97-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. In a study by Alizadeh Behbahani et al. [
 <xref rid="B39-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] edible coating of Shahri Balangu seed mucilage (SBM) incorporated with cumin essential oil (CEO) on beef slices was done and a sensory study of beef slices during the storage period of 9 days was carried out. It was observed that mucilage coated beef slices reduced the loss of lipid oxidation, microbial counts (total viable count TVC), 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, psychotropic count, yeast, and molds during the storage period. There was no adverse effect of SBM with CEO on sensory characteristics of beef and it conferred an excellent texture to the product as compared to the control sample. The different food applications of mucilage are shown in
