<p>Encapsulation of food ingredients, pharmaceutical ingredients, and nutraceutical ingredients is an effective technique to improve the stability of targeted compounds, apart from providing benefits on delivery characteristics [
 <xref rid="B99-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. The technique is used in the flavor industry to conceal undesirable taste/flavor notes such as the characteristic pungency and bitterness of polyphenols. This can be applied to a decline in the formation of rancidity in oil powders [

The preparation of the wall or filler material for the encapsulation of the bioactive substance is an important step because it influences the properties of the emulsion, compound preservation, and final product stabilization. several food-grade polymers have been discovered for nano and microencapsulation applications such as lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates. Furthermore, mucilage has a good ability to form a dense network after drying and their high molecular weight carbohydrate polymers make them suitable for nano and microencapsulation of food and bioactive compounds [
 <xref rid="B102-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. High molecular weights can aid in the retention of more key substances and increase stability. Plant-based mucilages are currently being investigated as wall materials for various encapsulation tests, in addition to their other applications.
