<p>Mucilage is widely used for the preparation of tablets due to its high adhesive property, good swelling, and water absorption ability, therefore it can be used as a disintegrant or binding agent. Moreover, mucilage obtained from the seeds and fruits is used to sustain or modify drug release [

Mucilage is a binding agent that is pharmaceutical excipients used in the manufacturing of tablets to affect the coherence and aggregation of the mixed powder for the enhanced flow properties of particles and to impart physical strength to the tablet. Chaudhary et al. [
 <xref rid="B111-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>] manufactured tablets by using 
 <italic>Grewia asiatica</italic> mucilage as a binding agent. During the in vitro dissolution study, released more than 80% of the drug within 30 min. They observed that percentage of friability and hardness of tablets was decreased with the increasing concentration of mucilage.
