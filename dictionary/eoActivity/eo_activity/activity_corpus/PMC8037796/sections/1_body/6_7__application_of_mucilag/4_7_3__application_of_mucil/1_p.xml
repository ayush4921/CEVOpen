<p>The skin comprises the three layers of the dermis, epidermis, and hypodermis, these are known as the largest organ in the body. A wound is a mechanical or physical injury that results in breaking or opening of the skin [
 <xref rid="B104-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. Dressing a wound to prevent it from bacterial infection is most important to allow the wound to heal quickly. Generally, dressing absorbs the exudates from the wounded skin and prevents the pathogenic microorganisms by producing moisture at the border of the wound [

Mucilage-based hydrogels are non-toxic, biocompatible, biodegradable, and easily available, therefore, used for the wound healing process. These hydrogels can be naturally removed or applied with wound beds without any significant interference [
