<p>Nowadays, plant-derived polymers (gums and mucilage) have attained a high demand in water purification due to their high water absorption capacities. Many components are responsible for water impurities, such as inorganic impurities (dyes), organic impurities (microorganisms), organic impurities (microorganisms), dissolved salts, heavy metals, and oils. moreover, seed or fruit mucilage is most effectively used towards such kind of water contaminators [

Furthermore, a Large concentration of contaminants in groundwater continues to be recorded as threats to the wellbeing of millions of people worldwide. Heavy metals are typically found in trace quantities in natural waters, but most are toxic even at low concentrations. Metals such as arsenic, lead, cadmium, nickel, mercury, and limited concentrations of zinc are highly dangerous for human health [
 <xref rid="B114-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. Heavy metals may reach the human body through food, water, air, or absorption through the skin when they come into contact with humans in agriculture, manufacturing, medicinal, industrial, or residential conditions [
 <xref rid="B115-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. Jones et al. [
 <xref rid="B116-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>] removed the selected heavy metal ions from the aqueous solution by using mucilage of 
 <italic>Dicerocaryum eriocarpum</italic> (act as a biosorption). Mucilage was modified with potassium chlorides and sodium. Also Compared the potassium chlorides mucilage and sodium mucilage with non-modified deionized water mucilage. They observed that potassium chlorides mucilage increased the intensity of mucilage but did not produce new functional groups. The result of the study showed that 
 <italic>Dicerocaryum eriocarpum</italic> mucilage has excellent binding attractions with heavy metal ions such as Fe, Zn, Cr, and Cd in the aqueous solution. In another study, Fox et al. [
 <xref rid="B117-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>] had worked on removing heavy metal from water using 
 <italic>cactus</italic> mucilage. Intially, they extracted mucilage from (cactus) for the removal of arsenic. and prepared two types of the extracts (i) gelling extract and (ii) non-gelling extract. Their work mainly revealed an interaction of cactus mucilage with arsenic. -CO groups (carboxyl and carbonyl groups) and -OH (hydroxyl) functional groups interaction with the arsenate. The outcome from their work comes is that the gelling extract shows a better average than the non-gelling extract. Mucilage extracted from 
 <italic>Hibiscus esculentus</italic> (okra) and 
 <italic>Malvasylvestris</italic> (mallow) and have been successful in eliminating turbidity from wastewater due to their substantial flocculation activity, however, there has been an increased (COD) chemical oxygen demand [
 <xref rid="B118-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. consequently, 
 <italic>Viciafaba</italic> and 
 <italic>Ficus-indica</italic> mucilage are environmentally friendly bio-flocculants in the treatment of COD as well as in the decoloration and turbidity from textile wastewater and have shown the capacity for more contamination removal relative to industrial flocculants such as Polyacrylamide A100PWG and EPENWATE EXP31/1, and are more likely to be environmentally safe [
