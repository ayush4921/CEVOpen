<p>Mucilage can act as a good emulsifying and suspending agent. An emulsion is a thermodynamically unstable, biphasic system, containing two non-miscible liquids that can be classified based on their droplet size into several categories, such as nano-emulsions (20–200 nm), microemulsions (100 Å–100 nm), and macroemulsions (1–100 μm); therefore, they are extensively used in various industrial applications such as in the food and pharmaceutical industries [

 <italic>Cucumis sativus</italic> Linnaeus mucilage were also compared with commercially available tragacanth and gelatin with an additional valuation of their combined effect on the emulsion properties. They observed a high emulsifying capacity of 
 <italic>Cucumis sativus Linnaeus</italic> mucilage as a primary emulsifying agent for oil–water emulsions. Likewise, Campos et al. [
 <xref rid="B108-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>] used chia seed mucilage as a replacer emulsifier for the formation of ice cream. Chia seed mucilage maintained the quality of the product, but its sensory properties were affected due to the dark color of mucilage. Moreover, plant-derived mucilage can increase the tensile strength of the hydration layer formed across the suspended solid particles by molecular interactions and hydrogen bonding. Therefore, these suspending agents perform well in the presence of moistening agents, as they do not reduce the interfacial surface tension. Thus, natural polysaccharides (mucilage) are commonly used as protective thickeners or colloids
