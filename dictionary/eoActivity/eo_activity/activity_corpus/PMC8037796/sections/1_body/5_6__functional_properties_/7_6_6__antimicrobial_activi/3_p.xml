<p>The mucilage is helpful in the development of free radicals by the membrane, which leads to porosity and the death of the cell. Moreover, mucilage generates ROS (reactive oxygen species), which are free radicals that easily react with other molecules in the cell due to the presence of oxygen, which causes the damaging of proteins, RNA, and DNA [

The mucilage can attach to the bacterial cell wall through several interactions in the cell membrane; therefore, the reducing the viability of the bacterial cell by inhibiting DNA replication. The bacterial cell comprises DNA bases enriched in sulfur and phosphorus, these biomaterials associate with the mucilage. Moreover, mucilage can break down the cell membrane permeability of pathogenic bacteria such as
