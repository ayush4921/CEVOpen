<p>All the scientific literature has shown that high water holding capacity is due to the presence of hydroxyl groups and protein substituents in the gum and mucilage structure. In 1996, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the united nation (FAO) described it as a potential source of polysaccharides due to its excellent property in aqueous solutions at low concentrations [

Water holding capacity is the capacity of a moist polymer or sample to hold water when exposed to an external centrifugal gravity force or compression. It comprises the sum of linked water, physically trapped water, and hydrodynamic water, the latter of which contributes most to this capacity [
 <xref rid="B13-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The low amount of water holding capacity can be attributed to the high solubility of mucilage even at a high concentration which leads to an inability to form a gel. Furthermore, mucilage is widely selected in the food system (fruits, vegetables, poultry, and fish) and contributed to improved emulsifying and water binding capacity of food [
