<p>Good foaming property is associated with the elastic structure of the mucilage, foaming property of mucilage is depending upon many factors, such as the presence of further compounds in the hydrocolloid, molecular weight, protein, structure, and carbohydrates. The good foaming capacity of mucilage is highly associated with the flexible structure of mucilage that can reduce the surface tension [
