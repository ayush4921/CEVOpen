 <xref rid="B78-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] studied the antioxidant activity of the polyphenols isolated from 
 <italic>Zizyphus mauritiana</italic> fruit mucilage against DPPH- 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl is 5.27 g mucilage/g DPPH, superoxide is 85.12%, ABTS- 2,2-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid is 16587.32 mmol Trolox Eq./g, and hydroxyl is 76.13%. Sardarodiyan et al. [
 <xref rid="B87-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] also studied the antioxidant activity and total phenolic compounds of 
 <italic>Lallemantia royleana</italic> seed mucilage and in their study, they observed antioxidant activity of 528.54 μg/mL of DPPH and total phenolic content of 82.56 ± 1.6 μg/GAE. In two different studies done by Jouki et al. [
