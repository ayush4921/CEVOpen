<p>Hydrocolloid polymers in the food industry and pharmaceutical industry are generally made up of large molecular biopolymers. A biopolymer contains a hydroxyl group which leading to viscous dispersions, increases the water attraction. Also, those hydrocolloids are widely used as a stabilizer, thickener, dietary fiber, whipping agent, and fat replacer. Moreover, they also have applications in crystallization inhibition, edible coatings, edible films, and encapsulating flavors [
