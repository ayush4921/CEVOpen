<p>Plant-derived polysaccharides such as gum, mucilage, and starch as well as Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) are widely used in emulsion products [

 <xref rid="B77-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Polysaccharide mucilage and gum are attracting attention towards commercial use in the pharmaceutical and food industry due to their excellent emulsifying properties, where they are used for suspension of particulates, stabilization of emulsions, control of crystallization, the thickening, and formation of films, encapsulation [
 <xref rid="B30-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The emulsion products prepared from different plants are checked for their stability by several scientists to use them for different purposes in different food and pharmaceutical industries. Sangeethapriya and Siddhuraju [
 <xref rid="B78-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] prepared the emulsion products from quince seed mucilage and they observed that the stability of the resulting product was 94.89% likewise Behrouzian et al. [
 <xref rid="B79-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] observed the high emulsifying capacity (92%) of cress seed mucilage while in another study by Jouki et al. [
 <xref rid="B80-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] it was observed that emulsifying capacity of 
 <italic>Zizyphus mauritiana</italic> fruit mucilage is about 54.12% and emulsifying stability is 42.14%.
