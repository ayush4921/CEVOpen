<p>Oil holding capacity is the most important functional property of hydrocolloids, which indicates oil absorption capacity. According to the reports, due to an increase in the accessibility of nonpolar chains with increasing molecular mobility of hydrophobic hydrocarbon domains, plant-derived mucilage show increased oil binding capacity with increases in temperature. The oil holding capacity of tamarind seed mucilage at 25 °C (0.068 ± 0.014 g/g), at 45 °C (0.104 ± 0.010 g/g), at 65 °C (0.133 ± 0.004 g/g); chia seed mucilage (12.97 ± 1.90 g/g); guar gum (0.87 ± 0.06 g/g); and basil seed mucilage (8.37 ± 1.02 g/g) [

Fruit or seed extracted mucilage has good oil binding capacity due to presence of monopolar molecules, therefore, it can trap higher amounts of oil particles and also prevent oil and the loss of flavor from food systems. Therefore, fruit or seed-derived mucilage can be used as a good functional ingredient in formulated foods [
