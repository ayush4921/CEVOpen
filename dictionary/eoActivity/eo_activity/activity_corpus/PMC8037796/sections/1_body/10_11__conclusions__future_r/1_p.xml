<p>In recent years, plant-derived polymeric carbohydrates have acquired high demand from food industries due to their diverse applications, such as as film coatings, emulsifiers, binders, and gelling agents. Among all carbohydrate polymers, mucilage has been abundantly used in the field of modern science due to its diverse applications. Plant-derived mucilage can be obtained from the special mucilage cells of different plant parts. Moreover, mucilage is mainly composed of complex carbohydrate polymers with highly branched structures that consist of L-arabinose, D-xylose, D-galactose, L-rhamnose, and galacturonic acid. They also contain glycoproteins and different bioactive components such as tannins, alkaloids, and steroids. Due to these properties, plant-derived mucilages can be used as an active functional ingredient, emulsifier, surfactant, stabilizer, encapsulating material, or cross-linker; therefore, they could be used for the fabrication of different types of nanocarrier. Moreover, researchers revealed broad-spectrum applications of biopolymer fabricated nanocarriers, especially nanohydrogels and metal nanoparticles, in the fields of medical and food sciences. Mucilage is a plant-derived polymer, their availability varies based on seasonal and environmental conditions. Apart from agronomical variations, these variations may affect the quality and production of mucilages; however, the extraction and purification processes are very complicated. Inadequate removal of mucilage, physical damage to the seed, and morphological features of the plant parts containing mucilage may all affect mucilage yield and consistency, posing a serious challenge to associated costs and the potential for mass production. The toxicity of mucilages is determined by their chemical composition and mode of action in food systems. As a result, it is important to determine the toxicity level of mucilages, particularly the presence of heavy metals in different plant sources. The toxic effects of mucilages can be determined using the fixed-dose procedure, which is recommended by guideline number 425 of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Mucilage contains around 10% moisture content, therefore the risk of microbial contamination during any stage of their processing may be high. This is due to the presence of biological substances that promote the growth and production of microorganisms in favorable conditions. Furthermore, the storage period is also a key factor in the contamination of mucilage. Studies have reported that variation in storage conditions leads to changes in the quality of mucilage. This often requires proper control of the different handling methods used at various stages of the supply chain. Moreover, modifications can also be made to address the disadvantages of uncontrolled biodegradability, shear instability, thermal decomposition, pH dependence, thickening, and uncontrolled hydration.</p>
