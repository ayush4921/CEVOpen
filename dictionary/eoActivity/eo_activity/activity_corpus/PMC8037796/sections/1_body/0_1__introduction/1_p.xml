<p>Plant-derived polymers have attained high demand in food and other industries due to their diverse industrial applications such as film coating, emulsifier, binder, and gelling agents, therefore they are excessively used in the textile industry, paper industry, and cosmetic industry [
 <xref rid="B1-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Nowadays, due to the hazardous effect of synthetic polymers on human health, people showed major interest in plant-based naturally derived biopolymers (gums, mucilage, cellulose, and glucans) as an effective ingredient for the formulation of eco-friendly, sustainable, cost-effective products [
 <xref rid="B3-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Moreover, a large number of polysaccharides can also be biosynthetically fabricated by several living organisms including plants, algae, animals, bacteria, and fungi [
 <xref rid="B4-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Also, natural polysaccharides are used in the food industry as they are regarded as safe for human consumption [
 <xref rid="B5-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Among various polysaccharides, plant-originated mucilage is widely used in various food industries due to its valuable broad-spectrum applications [
 <xref rid="B6-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Generally, mucilage can be obtained from several plants or their different parts such as 
 <italic>Aloe vera</italic>, 
 <italic>Salvia hispanica</italic> seeds, 
 <italic>Cordia dichotoma</italic>, 
 <italic>Basella alba, Plantago psyllium, Cyamopsis tetragonoloba</italic>, 
 <italic>Cactaceae, Abelmoschus esculentus, Trigonella foenum-graecum</italic>, 
 <italic>Moringa Oleifera,</italic> and 
 <italic>Linum usitatissimum.</italic> Plant-derived mucilage, due to its distinctive health (anticancer, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition extends to diabetes, and immunity stimulation) and food properties, is widely used as an active ingredient for the formulation of pharmaceutics, functional, and nutraceutical products [
 <xref rid="B7-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Structurally, mucilage (a complex of polymeric polysaccharide) is mainly composed of carbohydrates with highly branched structures that consist of monomer units of L-arabinose, D-xylose, D-galactose, L-rhamnose, and galacturonic acid. They also contain glycoproteins and different bioactive components such as tannins, alkaloids, and steroids [
 <xref rid="B8-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Also, mucilage produces an indefinite number of monosaccharides on hydrolysis, depending on the type of hydrolysis products obtained due to the nature of the polysaccharide. It can also further classify into pentose sugars (xylan) and hexose sugars (cellulose and starch) and can be considered as gum like components due to their similar physiological properties. However, both mucilage and gum are mostly related to hemicelluloses in composition, except the sugars produced by hemicelluloses such as xylose, glucose, and mannose instead of sugars produced by the gums such as galactose and arabinose [
 <xref rid="B11-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Moreover, that can be utilized in several applications such as edible coating, wound healing, tablet formation, encapsulation, water purification, and various nanocarriers. Mucilage exhibits an excellent functional property, however, due to the hydrogen bonding in between different functional and other polar groups, they also have an important role in film, emulsion, coated metal nanoparticles, and gel formation [
 <xref rid="B13-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In recent years, nanostructured hydrogels and mucilage coated metal nanoparticles are intensively used as a significant delivery vehicle for various hydrophilic and hydrophobic components [
 <xref rid="B14-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. For the formulation of nanohydrogel, different types of biopolymers and cross-linking polymers can be used and mucilage can act as either a primary biopolymer or a cross-linking component for the formulation of nanohydrogel [
 <xref rid="B15-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Several reports have been published on the formulation of stable nanohydrogels using mucilage as an active component and researchers revealed various therapeutic and food applications of the formulated nanohydrogels [
 <xref rid="B11-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Furthermore, nanohydrogels formulated with mucilage exhibit higher stability than that of other conventional plant-based biopolymers. Furthermore, metal nanoparticles coated with polymeric carbohydrates such as starch, dextran, chitosan, and mucilage are the most abundant nanocarriers used for targeted drug delivery. Because, in addition to increasing blood circulation time by hiding them from the immune system, their polymeric shells enable them to transfer and release the drug during biodegradation [
 <xref rid="B16-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-polymers-13-01066" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, only a few reports are published on the comprehensive knowledge of plant-derived mucilage, therefore, the present review is emphasized on the physicochemical properties, characterization, health, and functional attributes of the mucilage. Also, the application of mucilage crosslinked nanohydrogels and mucilage coated metal nanoparticles are discussed with mechanisms and schematic diagrams.
