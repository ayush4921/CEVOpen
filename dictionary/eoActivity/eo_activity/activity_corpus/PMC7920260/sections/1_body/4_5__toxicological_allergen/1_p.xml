<p>Numerous studies have pointed out the various beneficial effects of mango leaves extract against cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative diseases. These positive effects are due to the presence of a plethora of phytochemicals such as mangiferin followed by phenolic acids, benzophenones, and other antioxidants such as flavonoids, ascorbic acid, carotenoids, and tocopherols (20). Few studies also reported the toxic effects of MLE attributed to the presence of allergens. Mango allergy can occur in two ways: either the immediate hypersensitivity reaction as wheezing dyspnoea, anaphylaxis, erythema, urticaria, and angioedema, or the late reaction presenting as contact dermatitis and periorbital oedema [

Transcriptome analysis using high-throughput llumina sequencing of leaf and fruit reported the presence of 66 potential allergen genes mainly belonging to pollen allergen, pathogenesis-related protein Bet v I family and NADPH-dependent flavin mononucleotide (FMN) reductase [

A long-term study (three consecutive months) on Sprague Dawley rats at various doses (100, 300, and 900 mg/kg) of MLs revealed the slight body weight increase and higher fat weight, the serum thyroglobulin and cholesterol levels, and the slight increase in epididymis weight of male rats compared with the control group. The study also revealed no abnormalities on short-term exposure (14 days). The study concluded that MLs extract was safe at the maximum dose of 18.4 g/kg weight of mice [

In an independent study, MLs extract containing 60% mangiferin was evaluated in Han:Wist male and female rats in a 90 day study, and it was concluded that ML extracts demonstrated no observed adverse effect at the highest dose tested (2000 mg/kg body weight per day) [

 <italic>T. diversilobum</italic>). Hershko et al. [
 <xref rid="B97-antioxidants-10-00299" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>] reported the fact the individual with prior exposure to poison ivy/oak allergy may develop allergic contact dermatitis from mango on first exposure. Cross-sensitization of these plants with mango is known to be secondary to a superposition of urushiol antigen and 5-resorcinol, primarily found in mango peels [
