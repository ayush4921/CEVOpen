 <xref rid="B1-antioxidants-10-00299" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Mango is an evergreen tree with a lot of traditional medicinal resources apart from its very famous fruits. Mangoes are native to the South and Southeast Asia, and in 2018, the global production of mangoes (the report includes guavas and mangosteens) was 55.4 million tonnes. The largest mango producing countries are India, China, Thailand, Indonesia, Pakistan, Mexico, Brazil, Bangladesh, Nigeria, and the Philippines. Apart from its economically important portion (fruit), large amounts of crop residues such as leaves, flowers, stem, and bark are generated during pruning, which causes complications of disposal to the farmers. Mango leaves (MLs) are the potential source of minerals, viz. nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, iron, sodium, calcium, magnesium, and vitamins, viz. A, B, E, and C. A major bio-macromolecule present in mango leaves is protein. MLs can be utilized as an alternative source of livestock feeding in developing countries for alleviating the food shortage for livestock.
