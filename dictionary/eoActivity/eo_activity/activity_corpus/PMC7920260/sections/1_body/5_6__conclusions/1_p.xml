<p>MLs exhibit exceptional biological, medicinal, and metabolic properties. MLs are otherwise considered as a waste material generated mainly through the pruning of mango plants; in reality, they are a most significant resource containing a wide variety of bioactive compounds (phenolics and essential oils), crude protein, dietary fiber, minerals, and vitamins. The various bioactive compounds present in the MLs include phenolic compounds, flavonoids, benzophenones, sesquiterpenes, saponins, xanthones, tannins, terpenoids, and alkaloids. MLs extract is found useful for the treatment of common diseases like diarrhea, chronic ailments like diabetes, and fatty liver disease. MLs extract possessed strong anti-proliferative activity against pancreatic, breast, human colon carcinoma, and other types of cancers. The extracts of MLs are also crucial in as an anti-obesity agent and demonstrate hepatoprotective action. There are numerous vital chemical compounds present in mango leaves, which are instrumental to performing various metabolic, bacteriostatic, and antimicrobial activities. Some of these include gurjunene, trans-caryophyllene, humulene, selinene, and so on. Mangiferin present in MLs was also found to mitigate the oxidative stress involved in the treatment of numerous pathologies. MLs are thus a potential source of cost-effective food supplements and nutritive ingredients for improving human health and curing acute and chronic diseases.</p>
