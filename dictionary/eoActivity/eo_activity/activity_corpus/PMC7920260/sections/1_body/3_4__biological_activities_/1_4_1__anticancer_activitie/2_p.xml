<p>A study was conducted to investigate the antitumoral effects of ML extracts on (MDA-MB-231) highly and (MCF7) minimally invasive breast cancer cells and (MCF10) non-tumorigenic cells at IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt;200 µg/mL [
 <xref rid="B41-antioxidants-10-00299" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The leaf extracts displayed protective properties against cytotoxic and oxidation effects on breast cancer cell lines and minimal damage to non-carcinogenic cells. MLs extracts with a high concentration of homo-mangiferin and methyl gallate were found more effective against MDA-MB-231 cells, while gallotannins showed cytotoxicity against MCF7 cells. In another study, ethanolic extract of mango leaves at a concentration of IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt;200 µg/mL exhibited cytotoxic activities against lung fibroblast (ATCC CLS 300421,WI-38 VA-13 subline 2RA), skin fibroblast (ATCC CRL1947, CCD-986SK), colon adenocarcinoma (ATCC CCL227, SW 620), gastric carcinoma (ATCC HTB103, Kato-III), liver hepatoblastoma (ATCC HB8065, Hep-G2), bronchogenic carcinoma (ATCC HTB-168TB, Chago K-1), and ductal carcinoma (ATCC HTB20, BT474) [
