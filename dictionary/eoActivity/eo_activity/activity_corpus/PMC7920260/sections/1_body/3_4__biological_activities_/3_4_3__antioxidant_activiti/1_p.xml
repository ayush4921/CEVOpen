<p>Many recent studies have shown that free radicals generated during the metabolic process contribute to various degenerative diseases such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, ischaemic diseases, neurological disorders, and many more [
 <xref rid="B53-antioxidants-10-00299" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Antioxidant substances, on the other side, provide a high level of antioxidant activity to lessen the adverse effects of free radicals. MLs were reported to have antioxidant capacity due to the presence of phenolics and flavonoids in different studies [
 <xref rid="B54-antioxidants-10-00299" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. High-performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization and quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-qTOF-MS/MS) analysis of MLs extract had identified neomangiferin, mangiferin, kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, isoquercitrin, and quercetin as the main compounds and also reported that these compounds contributed directly to the antioxidant activity of MLs [
 <xref rid="B55-antioxidants-10-00299" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay and superoxide dismutase (SOD)-like activity had shown that MLs serve as a moderate antioxidant with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of ~9 and 117 μg/mL [
 <xref rid="B56-antioxidants-10-00299" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In another analysis, MLs methanol extract provided radical scavenging activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 13.37 μg/mL [
 <xref rid="B57-antioxidants-10-00299" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Fraction analysis of MLs extract with n-butanol, hexane, and ethylacetate demonstrated that ethylacetate fraction had the highest antioxidant capacity of 1226 and 2817.99 mg trilox/g estimated using DPPH and 2,2′-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) assay, respectively, and reducing power of 10172.59 µmol FeSO
 <sub>4</sub>.7H
 <sub>2</sub>O/g extracts analyzed through ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay [
 <xref rid="B58-antioxidants-10-00299" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Similarly, subcritical water extracts of MLs had antioxidant activity index (AAI) values of 7.92 ± 0.16 and demonstrated superior activity to (+)-α-tocopherol (AAI = 3.65 ± 0.07) [
 <xref rid="B41-antioxidants-10-00299" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Trolox equivalent antioxidant ability (TEAC) study of MLs extracts had recorded 2.13 and 2.59 mmol TE/g DW TEAC values, respectively, for mangiferin pentoside and benzophenones [
 <xref rid="B59-antioxidants-10-00299" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The efficacy of the MLs was also studied in the chitosan-based films, and it was found that antioxidant capacity of the MLs supplemented chitosan films improved in a dose-dependent manner [
 <xref rid="B60-antioxidants-10-00299" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The antioxidant activity of hydroalcoholic MLs extract fermented with either 
 <italic>Lactobacillus casei</italic> or effective microorganisms had higher antioxidant activity. The study also showed that fermented extracts decreased lipopolysaccharide-generated reactive oxygen species [
 <xref rid="B61-antioxidants-10-00299" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In an advanced study, MLs extract was found suitable as a green antioxidant for increasing the storage life of biodiesel [
 <xref rid="B62-antioxidants-10-00299" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. In summary, many interesting results indicated the potential of MLs extract as an antioxidant with wider applicability in food, food packaging, and many more industries.
