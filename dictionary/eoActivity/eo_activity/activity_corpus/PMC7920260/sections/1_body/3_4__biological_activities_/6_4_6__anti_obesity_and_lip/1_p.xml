<p>Obesity is the one of the most prevalent disorders in the world due to dietary habit, sedentary lifestyle, and stress, which promotes various cardiovascular disease and pathological conditions like thrombosis atherosclerosis, hypertension, inflammation, and hepatosteatosis. These problems can be overcome by a change in lifestyle and/or by using drugs. However, there is a need for an alternative natural way for treatment due to numerous side-effects of available drugs. Hypocholesterol activity of methanolic extract of MLs was evaluated using in-vitro pancreatic cholesterol esterase inhibition assay to identify bioactive compounds related to it. The study revealed that the mangiferin is the major compound present in MLs extract, but does not alter the cholesterol esterase inhibition assay, whereas 3b-taraxerol (IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.86 μg/mL) exhibited hypocholesterol activity [

In an independent study, the effect of MLs extracts from Ubá variety was evaluated for the anti-obesity activity in obese rats (male Wistar rats) fed with high-fat diet. The consumption of MLs tea at the concentration of 24.7 mL/day resulted in increased antioxidant activity along with anti-inflammatory effects. The finding was established by increased total antioxidant activity and concentration of interleukin10, decreased abdominal fat accumulation, increased expression of PPAR-γ, and lipoprotein lipase and reduction in the expression of fatty acid synthase [

Authors concluded that MLs tea have anti-obesity therapeutic potential by modulating the expression of enzymes and transcriptional factors related to adipogenesis. In in-vivo condition, cholesterol lowering activity was evaluated in female albino Wistar rats. Three major compounds, viz. 3β-taraxerol, mangiferin, and iriflophenone-3-C-β-glucoside, were identified through HPLC. The plasma triglycerides were significantly reduced by oral dose of MLs extract (90 mg/kg from day 21 to 42), which confirms cholesterol-lowering activity of MLs extract [

 <xref rid="B78-antioxidants-10-00299" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] prepared a methanolic extract and evaluated it in vitro and in vivo. In the experiment, a dyslipidemia model using Wistar rats was practised to evaluate the effect of MLs extract on lipid levels in the blood. Rats were treated with 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg MLE and evaluated at the zeroth, 15th, and 32th day. Studies showed the application of MLs extract lowered the cholesterol by 40–47% and exhibited about 62% antihyperlipidemic activity compared to control at an oral dose of 200 mg/kg. It also maintains lower triglycerides level and enhanced high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by 2.44 and 4.11 times at the 15th day in MLs extract treated rats (200 and 400 mg/kg, respectively). The above-mentioned studies showed the potential of ML in lowering the body fat and reducing the occurrence of cardiovascular disease related to obesity. The biological activities of MLs extract is reported in
