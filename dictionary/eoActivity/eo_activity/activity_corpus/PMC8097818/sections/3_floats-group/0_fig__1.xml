  <p>Total phenols, flavonoids and proanthocyanidins in ethanol extracts 
   <italic>M.communis</italic> L. leaves subjected to different drying treatments. Total phenols were expressed in mg GAE/g, total flavonoids were expressed in mg QE/g, Total proanthocyanidins were expressed in mg CE/g. (EE_Tamb): leaves were dried at room temperature (16 °C); (EE_70, EE_100, and EE_120): leaves were oven dried at 70, 100, and 120 °C respectively; (EE_MW): leaves were dried in microwave as reported in Materials and Method. Each bar is the mean of 3 independent trials ± S.D. Data sharing different letter are significantly at p &lt; 0.05 (one way ANOVA followed by Tukey Post hoc test)
