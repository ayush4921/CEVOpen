<p id="Par56">The obtained results showed that microwave drying led to the highest increase in the amounts of the identified compounds (4.27 mg/g), two times higher than in air dried leaves extract (2.12 mg/g) and 1.5 times higher than in 70 °C dried extract (2.87 mg/g). Whereas, Oven drying at 100 and 120 °C led to significant reduction (p &lt; 0.05) in their amounts. Drying at 100 °C caused a loss of 30% compared to air dried sample. The decrease was more pronounced when leaves were dried at 120 °C with a loss rate of 60%, leading to total content on phenolic compounds of 1.08 mg/g. Among the identified compounds, quercetin 3-
 <italic>O</italic>-rhamnoside was the most susceptible to high temperatures heat treatment. This compound was absent in oven drying leaves extracts at 100 and 120 °C.
