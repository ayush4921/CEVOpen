<p id="Par62">Though good the antioxidant activity of the extracts tested by the DPPH assay was basically dose dependent (data not shown). The extracts radical scavenging activity was determined by the amount of sample required for 50% scavenging of DPPH radical (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) which is inversely related to the antioxidant activity which means that higher IC
 <sub>50</sub> the lower the antioxidant activity. IC
 <sub>50</sub> ranged from 2.4 to 48.5 µg/ml and the differences of antioxidant capacities were very large up to 20-fold. The extract possessing the most powerful DPPH scavenging activity was obtained from microwave dried leaves with IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.4 µg/ml. Concerning oven drying methodology, the highest effect was observed in the extract from 70 °C dried leaves (7.6 µg/ml), followed by the extract from 100 °C dried leaves (27.5
