<p id="Par65">The free radical scavenging ability of the dried myrtle leaves extracts was also determined using the ABTS
 <sup>.+</sup> radical cation. Based on the obtained results (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) microwave dried leaves extract has the highest free radical scavenging ability and the order of ABTS
 <sup>.+</sup>results was consistent with that of DPPH and β-carotene assays. A negative correlation was observed between ABTS scavenging ability and total phenols (r = − 0.79, R
 <sup>2</sup> = 62.14), flavonoids (r = − 0.88, R
 <sup>2</sup> = 77.61) and proanthocyanidins (r = − 0.79, R
 <sup>2</sup> = 63.29).
