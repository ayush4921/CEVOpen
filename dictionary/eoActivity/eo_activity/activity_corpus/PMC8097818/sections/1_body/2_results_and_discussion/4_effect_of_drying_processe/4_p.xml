<p id="Par64">For the β-carotene method, which evaluates the ability of plant extracts in inhibiting conjugated diene hydroperoxydes formation arising from linoleic acid oxidation, AA ranged from 34.7 to 68.1 and the difference of antioxidant activities were significant (p &lt; 0.05). Nevertheless, all the tested extracts displayed intermediate antioxidant activities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. EEs from microwave and 70 °C heated leaves showed 68.1% and 60.7% inhibition, respectively, values higher than that of the synthetic antioxidant BHT (58.2%). The other extracts showed lower antioxidant activities. EE_120 showed the weakest antioxidant activity in the β-carotene method with an AA of 34.7% which was about the half of the activity achieved by EE_MW. A positive correlation was determined between AA and total phenols (r = 0.95, R
 <sup>2</sup> = 91.66), flavonoids (r = 0.98, R
 <sup>2</sup> = 96.28) and proanthocyanidins (r = 0.98, R
 <sup>2</sup> = 96.31).
