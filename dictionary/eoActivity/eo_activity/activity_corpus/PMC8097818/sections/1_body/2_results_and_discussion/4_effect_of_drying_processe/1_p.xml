<p id="Par61">The EEs of heat treated 
 <italic>M. communis</italic> L. leaves were evaluated for the antioxidant activity using the DPPH, the β-carotene bleaching method and ABTS
 <sup>.+</sup> radical scavenging activity assay and compared to BHT. The antioxidant capacity is directly related to the content of phenolic compounds [
