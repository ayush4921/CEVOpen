<p id="Par72">The oil samples have an initial peroxide value of the order of 2 meq O
 <sub>2</sub>/kg indicating the smooth running of oil production stages. During storage there is a rise in the peroxide value indicating the appearance of peroxides (primary oxidation products) in the oil samples. Synthetic antioxidant (BHT) oil samples and 
 <italic>M. communis</italic> L extracts showed lower peroxide values than the control sample. After 21 days the peroxide value of the latter exceeds 200 meq O
 <sub>2</sub>/kg of oil which is 7xPV_OE_MW, 4.4xPV_OE_BHT. This variability in peroxide values can be explained by the difference in phenolic content, antioxidant potentials, and the ability to trap free radicals in soybean oil. The obtained results are correlated with those obtained for the in vitro study of the antioxidant activity of the extracts. The present findings agree with previous research who have reported the positive effect of rosemary extract on soybean oil oxidative stability [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] where the methanolic extract of 
 <italic>Mentha pulegium</italic> was found to be able to preserve sunflower oil against oxidation.
