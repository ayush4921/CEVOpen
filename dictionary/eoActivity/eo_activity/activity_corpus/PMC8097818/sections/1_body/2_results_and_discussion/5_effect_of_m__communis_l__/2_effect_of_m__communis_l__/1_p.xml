<p id="Par71">The peroxide value is concerned with the number of active oxygens in the organic chains of a fatty substance (lipids, free fatty acids, monoglycerides, diglycerides and triglycerides). This index makes it possible to evaluate the oxidation degree of the unsaturated fatty acids of the fat (rancidity). The higher it is, the more the fat is oxidized. The results of the evolution of the peroxide values of the oil samples are illustrated in Fig.Â
