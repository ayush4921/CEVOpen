<p id="Par82">Another possible explanation is the production of phenolic substances taking place during the drying. Indeed, the formation of additional compounds might occur due to the availability of precursors of phenolic compounds already present in the samples by non-enzymatic interconversion between existing polyphenols [

 <italic>M. communis</italic> L. leaves. Our results are concordant with those reported by the literature. Indeed, similar results were also found by Ho and Lin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] who reported that heat treatment of citrus peels at low temperature (&lt; 100 °C) reduces the destructive impact of high temperature (150 °C) on the most abundant phenolic compound. As for Chan et al
 <italic>.</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], they observed, for 
 <italic>Thunbergia laurifolia</italic> leaves, declines in total phenolic content (36%) and ascorbic acid equivalent antioxidant activity (25%) following oven-drying and enhancement by 38% and 84%, respectively after microwave drying compared to fresh leaves. The authors attributed the beneficial effect of microwave treatment on the antioxidant capacity to the rapid inactivation of polyphenoloxidase (PPO) activity in samples.
