<p id="Par63">Overall, 
 <italic>M. communis</italic> L. leaves extracts showed higher DPPH scavenging activity than that of the synthetic antioxidant BHT (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 20 µg/ml). A negative correlation was observed between IC
 <sub>50</sub> and total phenols (r = − 0.90, R
 <sup>2</sup> = 81.90), flavonoids (r = − 0.93, R
 <sup>2</sup> = 88.28) and proanthocyanidins (r = − 0.91, R
 <sup>2</sup> = 83.48) which is in accordance with data we found in literature [
