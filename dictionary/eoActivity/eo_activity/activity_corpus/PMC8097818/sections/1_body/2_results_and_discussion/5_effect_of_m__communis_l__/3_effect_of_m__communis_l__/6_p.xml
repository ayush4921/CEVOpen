<p id="Par80">Polyphenols, phytochemicals with diverse structural varieties, have gained recently greater attention because of some findings indicating their wide range of biological properties such as anti-cancer, antiviral and inhibition of oxidative mechanisms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Their extraction process is complex and challenging as it depends on several factors such as the type of solvent, the solvent/solid ratio, the number of extraction steps, pH, time of contact, temperature as well as the post-harvest technological processes mainly the drying process. Until now, the majority of studies on myrtle have focused on the variability of essential oil and phenolic compounds among different plant parts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] and localities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] or the effect of extraction method and solvent on the antiradical activity of myrtle leaf extracts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, there are no data about the effect of the drying methodology on the chemical composition or the antioxidant activity of myrtle leaves extract. Thus, the main objective of this manuscript was to increase awareness about the importance of this step which is often overlooked, not optimized, or not properly documented as sample preparation is often considered “as a means to an end” in most studies. In the present work, the obtained results demonstrate that drying process optimization is critical step for plant extracts preparation. In fact, plant extracts containing high antioxidant activities can be of multiple benefits for wellness and health maintenance and may increase the demand of these bioactive substances for food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries.
