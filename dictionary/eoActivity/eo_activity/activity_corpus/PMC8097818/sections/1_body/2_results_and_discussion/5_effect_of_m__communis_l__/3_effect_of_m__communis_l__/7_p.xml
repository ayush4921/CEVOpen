<p id="Par81">The beneficial effect of heat treatment on the antioxidant capacity could be attributed to an increase in phenolic compounds content [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] the transformation of phenolic compounds from unextractable form to extractable form could be a plausible mechanism responsible for the elevated antioxidant activity of vegetal tissue during cooking. In the same way, Rakic et al
 <italic>.</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] found that hydrolysable tannins were degraded during thermal treatment of oak acorns leading to an increase of non-tannin phenolic content, especially gallic acid. As a result, thermal treatment lead to an increase in antioxidant activity when compared to the control. Accordingly, they suggest that the presence of gallic acid and its low molecular mass derivates caused the potent antioxidant properties of the studied samples [
