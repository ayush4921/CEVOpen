<p id="Par74">Indeed, exposed to air and light, all the oils develop, after a more or less long time, a rancid odor. This oxidative rancidity is due to the fixation of the oxygen of the air on the unsaturated fatty chains by a radical and auto-catalytic mechanism which results in the formation of hydroperoxides. These compounds are unstable and evolve, following complex mechanisms and still poorly known, to low molecular weight products responsible for the rancid odor. This phenomenon is accelerated by exposure to light, by the rise in temperature and the presence of metal catalysts. The rate of oxidation increases with the degree of unsaturation of fatty acids and is also influenced by the position of unsaturations within the fatty chain. The rancid odor depends not only on the degree of oxidation but also on the nature of the oxidized fatty acid (oleic, linoleic or linolenic acid). Each acid will lead to oxidation products of different structure and quantity [
