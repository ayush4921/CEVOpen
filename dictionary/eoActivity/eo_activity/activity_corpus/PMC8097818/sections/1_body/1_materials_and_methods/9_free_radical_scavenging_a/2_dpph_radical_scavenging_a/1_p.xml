<p id="Par37">The assay was conducted as described by Chen et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. 2 mL of a serial extract concentrations in ethanol and 2 mL of ethanol for control sample were added to equal volume of a DPPH solution in ethanol (2.10
 <sup>–4</sup> M) and incubated for 30 min in the dark at room temperature. The absorbance of the samples was measured at 517 nm using ethanol as a blank. The radical scavenging activity was expressed as IC
 <sub>50</sub> (
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) which is the concentration providing the inhibition of 50% DPPH radicals. The inhibition percentage of free radicals was determined based on the equation: %inhibition = [1– AS/AC] × 100, where AC and AS are the absorbance of the control and the tested sample respectively at t = 30 min.
