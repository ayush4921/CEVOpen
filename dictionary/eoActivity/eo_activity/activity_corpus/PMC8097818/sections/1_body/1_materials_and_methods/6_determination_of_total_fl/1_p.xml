<p id="Par33">Total flavonoids content estimation was realized with the AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. 1.5 mL of extracts was added to equal volumes of a solution of 2% AlCl
 <sub>3</sub>.6H
 <sub>2</sub>O. The mixture was thoroughly mixed and incubated for 10 min at room temperature; the absorbance was read at 367.5 nm. Data were expressed in mg quercetin equivalents per gram (mg QE/g) of dried extract.
