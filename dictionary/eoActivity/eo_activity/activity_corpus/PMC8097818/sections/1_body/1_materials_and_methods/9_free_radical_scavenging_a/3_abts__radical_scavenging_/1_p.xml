<p id="Par38">The ABTS scavenging activity was evaluated following Re et al

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] method with some modifications. The radical cation ABTS is generated by mixing equal volume 0.5 ml of a 3 mM potassium persulfate K
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>8</sub> solution and a solution stock of ABTS at 8 mM, protected from light at 4 °C for 16 h before use. The obtained solution is diluted with ethanol to reach an absorbance of 0.7 at 734 nm. 990µL of this freshly prepared solution is added to 10 µL of the EEs at different concentrations and the absorbance is read at 734 nm after 10 min.
