<p id="Par45">The peroxide index was determined based on spectrophotometric measurements at 560 nm of a mixture containing 300 mg oil samples, 9.9 ml choloroform/methanol mixture at a ration 7:3, 50 ml xylenol orange (10 mM). The mixture was catalyzed by iron (II) chloride, allowed to react for 5 min at room temperature, and then centrifuged at 1000
