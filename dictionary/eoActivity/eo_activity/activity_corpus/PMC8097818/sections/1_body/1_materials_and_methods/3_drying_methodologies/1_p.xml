<p id="Par30">The drying procedures used in this study were optimized after several preliminary assays and based on a previous study conducted by Sellami et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In fact, 
 <italic>M. communis</italic> L. leaves were subjected to three different drying methodologies as fellow (i) Air drying process consisted of scattering myrtle leaves in trays in shadow at ambient temperature (16 °C) to be used as control, (ii) Oven drying carried out in ventilated oven at three different temperatures (70, 100 and 120 °C), and (iii) Microwave treatment was performed in a domestic digital microwave:500 g myrtle leaves, placed in glass beaker and heated at 500 W for 5 min. In case of microwave treatment, some preliminary experiments were conducted to evaluate the optimum treatment time at intermediate power (500 w). In fact, treatment for less than 5 min did not reduce the moisture content to a stable level which should be below 10%, and treatment for more than 5 min did significantly damage the sample.
