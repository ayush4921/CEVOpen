<p id="Par41">The antioxidant activity of EEs was estimated through β-carotene bleaching method as described by Suja et al
 <italic>.</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Briefly, 0.2 mg β-carotene, 20 mg linoleic acid and 200 mg Tween 40 were mixed in chloform. Then the mixture was concentrated by evaporating the solvent. The obtained residue was emulsified in 50 ml oxygenated distilled water and aliquoted. Finally, 0.2 mL of EEs (0.2 mg/ml), ethanol and BHT respectively for negative and positive controls were added to aliquots (4 mL) of the β-carotene/linoleic acid emulsion, and heated at 50 °C, in a water bath, in order to accelerate the oxidation. The absorbance was measured at 470 nm until the discoloration of the control solution (t = 120 min).
