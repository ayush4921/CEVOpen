<p id="Par24">Phenolic compounds extraction has several critical points like the choice of the plant phenological stage, the choice of solvent, the method of extraction and purification as well as the post-harvest technological processes mainly the drying process [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In fact, immediately after harvesting, fresh plants are usually dried in order to facilitate their transportation, storage and handling. Nevertheless, various chemical changes could occur during the drying affecting the content of phenolic compounds, thereby resulting in the change of the antioxidant activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Generally, a depletion of active principals and deterioration by reducing enzymatic activities are observed [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. As a consequence, the drying process is a key factor that enables to preserve the quality of medicinal plants and their bioactive extracts and compounds. Different methods are used to dry fresh plant tissues such as air drying, oven drying and microwave drying. Air and oven drying usually take a very long time which may lead to significant decrease of the quality of the dried product [
