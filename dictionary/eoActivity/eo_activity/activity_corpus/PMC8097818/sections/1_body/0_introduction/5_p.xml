<p id="Par27">A survey of the recent literature revealed that there was no report on the drying effect on 
 <italic>M. communis</italic> L. leaves composition as well as in its use as food additive for lipid oxidation. Thus, the purposes of this work were i) to examine the extractability and the quality of phenolic compounds following different drying methodologies of 
 <italic>M. communis</italic> L. leaves in correlation with its antioxidant capacity and ii)Â to evaluate the effectiveness of 
 <italic>M. communis</italic> L. extracts on retarding the oxidation of soybean oil.
