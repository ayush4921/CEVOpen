<p id="Par30">Lan et al. confirmed that berberine has a major hypotensive effect by numerous mechanisms. BBR raises the expression of enzyme eNOS which is associated with synthesis and release of NO followed by vasodilation. This vasodilation is possibly arbitrated by well known vasodilator PGI2 and KATP channels opening as well as Ca
