<p id="Par22">In vivo animal studies showed that 
 <italic>A. graveolens</italic> hasa hypotensive effect [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. According to Moghadam et al. its hexaneextracts of seed decrease blood pressure more effectively in hypertensive rats than its additional extracts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. This is because of betterpreservation of n-butylphthalide, which is responsible for the flavor and aromatic odor of celery. This effect of n-butylphthalide was also supported by SHRs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. According to Ko et al. apigeninflavoneextracted form effect voltage and receptor gated channels via blocking of Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> influxwhich in result block aortic ring contractions in the isolated aorta of rat [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Houston reported that active components of celery lower human arterial pressure probably by the declining the intensity of circulating catecholamines and lowering vascular resistance [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Moreover, Popovic et al
 <italic>.</italic> reported that the flavonoid content of this herb reduces oxidative stress which can potentiate antioxidant mechanisms [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Moghadam et al. confirmed that celery seeds have a hypotensive effect due to some hydrophobic components, such as n-butylphthalide (NBP) [
