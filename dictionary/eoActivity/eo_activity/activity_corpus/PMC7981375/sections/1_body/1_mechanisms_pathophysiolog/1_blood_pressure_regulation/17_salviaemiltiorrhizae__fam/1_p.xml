 <italic>Salviaemiltiorrhizae</italic> is oldest and regularly used traditional herbs of China generally utilized for CVDs treatment. Its major phytochemicals are danshensu, tanshinones (tanshinone I &amp;tanshinone II) salvianolic acids (A &amp; B) with other compounds as minor. Mainly root extracts, hold beneficial pharmacological behavior like anti-microbial, antiviral, anti-oxidant, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory activity and cardiovascular diseases [
