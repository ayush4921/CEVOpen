<p id="Par34">Asgary et al. run a random, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial by the administration of 
 <italic>Crataegus curvisepala’s</italic>hydro-alcoholic extracts of flowers for three months found that both DBP and SBP decreased by around 8 and 13 mmHg, respectively. The major chemical constituent of 
 <italic>Crataegustanacetifolia</italic>isquercetin, a polyphenolic flavonoid, which is responsible for its major pharmacological functions a vasorelaxant, anti-inflammatory and anti oxidanteffects.Other multiple components of these plants are oligomeric proanthocyanidins
 <italic>i.e.</italic> procyanid in, procyanidin B-2, hyperoside etc. and flavonoids 
 <italic>i.e.</italic> vitexin,rutin, etc. Moreover, extracts of hawthorn iseffectual on both endothelial cells and VSMCs. 
 <italic>Crataegustanacetifolia’s</italic>extract cause vasodilation by increasing phosphorylation and activation of eNOS at serine1177 which in result enhances synthesis and release of NO in endothelial cells [

 <italic>.</italic> informed that flower and leaves extract and segregate, hyperosideof Crataegus, probably, can activate multiple signaling pathways, as PI3-kinase,eNOS, Src, ROS, Akt and up-regulation of antioxidant enzymes (CAT, SOD) to produce endothelium-dependent relaxation.Together with the contribution of all of the mechanisms of actions ameliorate 
 <italic>Crataegus’s</italic> hypertensive outcome. Interestingly, the extract has anti-inflammatory action also by decreasing the level ofVCAM-1, IL-6, NF-kB, iNOS andTNF-a [
