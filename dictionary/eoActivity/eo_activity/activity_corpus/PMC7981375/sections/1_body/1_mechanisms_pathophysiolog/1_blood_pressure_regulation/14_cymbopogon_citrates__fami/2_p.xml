 <italic>C. citrates</italic> (having citral as the main active constituent) displayed vasorelaxation on the phenylephrine-stimulated contractions in a dose-dependent manner. Citral effects synthesis and release of NO to produce vasorelaxantion by inhibiting the attenuation caused by L-NAME. Moreover, leaves extract may affectsthe synthesis of prostacyclin to induce relaxation. Furthermore, the relaxant effect of the combination of the extract of root, stems and leaves may be due to the blockage of Ca

Fresh leaf extract of Cymbopogon citrates in combination with other herbal medicines like fruitsâ€™extract of Citrus medica and fresh leaf extract of Persea americanacan reduce hypertension in rats induced by sucrose and ethanol. This mixture can be used to protect kidney, liver and vascular endothelium damaged by chronic utilization of sucroseand ethanol [
