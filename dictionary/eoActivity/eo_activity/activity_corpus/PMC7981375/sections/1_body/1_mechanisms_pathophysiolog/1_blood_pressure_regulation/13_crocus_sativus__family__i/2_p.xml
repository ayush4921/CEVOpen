<p id="Par38">Its main chemical constituents are crocin, safranal, picrocrocin and crocetin. These components act as anti-hypertensive by different mechanisms of action. Modaghegh et al. reported that regular use of saffron for 7 days can cause a major fall in arterial pressure and SBP in healthy humans because of its vasorelaxant action [

Later on, in 2015, they also reported that safranal on chronic administration can reduce SBP in salt hypertensive rats but didn’t affect normotensive one.Boskabady et al. mentioned that chemical constituents of saffron mainly crocinreduced contraction and heart rate of guinea-pig
