 <italic>RauwolfiaSerpentina</italic> is mainly used to treat hypertension. It slows down the activity ofnervous system which in result decreases heart rate and dilates blood vessels. Rauwolfia consists of indolealkaloids as major phytochemical with others including fatty acids, alcohols, sugars and glycosides, steroids, phytosterols, flavonoids, oleoresins and tannins.indolealkaloids are present in all parts of the plant but major source is root’s bark. The identified different indole derivatives are ajmalinine, ajmalidine, ajmalicine, ajmaline, coryanthine, aricine, deserpidine, canescine, lankanescine, isoserine, isoajmaline, isoserpiline, rauhimbine, neoajmaline, raubasine, papaverine, raucaffricine, reserpine, recanescine, reserpiline, rauwolfinine, rescinnamine, thebaine, serpentinine, reserpinine, serpentine, yohimbine, sarpagine and yohimbinine [

Reserpine has the irreversible binding capacity to VMAT2 results in biogenic amines depletion e.g. serotonin, nor-adrenaline and dopamine level in VTA (ventral tegmental area), hypothalamus and nucleus accumbens.Molecular mechanism shows that VMAT2 protein irreversibly binds to storage vesicles in cell and causes ‘leak’ their content, 
 <italic>e.g.</italic>monoamine, into the cytosol which is then tainted by MAO-A enzymes. According to this mechanism renovation of monoamines is independent of age [
