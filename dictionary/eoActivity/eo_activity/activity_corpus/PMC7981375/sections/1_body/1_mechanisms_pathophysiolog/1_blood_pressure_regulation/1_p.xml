 <italic>.</italic> of the cardiovascular system can conclude BP. The maintenance of physiological BP levels involves a multifaceted relationship of diverse elements of an incorporated neurohumoral system which includes the natriuretic peptides, renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), endothelium cells, immune system and sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Any imbalance in components of this incorporated neurohumoral system can indirectly or directly cause an increase or decrease in theaverage BP level. Moreover, if this imbalance remains for a long time, leads to damage of thetarget-organ (as CKD and left ventricular hypertrophy) and CVD also.
