<p id="Par32">The major chemical constituents of coriander are linalool, geranyl acetate and gamma-terpinene. It also have other chemical constituents like a-cedrene (3.87%), citronellal (1.96%), geraniol (1.87%), b-pinene (1.82%), b-sesquiphell-andrene (1.56%), citral and Citronellyl acetate (1.36% each), citronellol (1.31%), m-cymene (1.27%) and a-farnesence (1.22%) as minor. Till date coriander havebeen not tested in clinical trials to evaluate its result on BP but, it is reported in many studies that coriander shows antioxidant activities and inhibits ROS production by b-adrenoceptor. Jabeen et al. reported that vasodilatory effects of dilute methanolic extort of well dried seeds and powder of coriander produced and mean arterial blood pressure, SBP and DBP fall in a dose-dependent manner in normotensive Spragueâ€“Dawley rats [

 <sup>++</sup> channel blockade and endothelial-dependent pathways [
