Therefore, natural products such as traditional herbs show great promise in the development of potentially effective new antiviral drugs. Particularly, recent studies on phytochemicals, such as quercetin, chlorogenic acid, mentofin, and linalool abundantly found in many plants and vegetables, eliminate the efforts and huge costs of finding lots of antiviral vaccines that need to be renewed every year and allow us to be more optimistic about the successful management of the next influenza outbreaks.
