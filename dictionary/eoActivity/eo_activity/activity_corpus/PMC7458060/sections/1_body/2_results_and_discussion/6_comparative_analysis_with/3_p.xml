<p id="p0150">According to screening results found in the global literature, the most preferred plants in experimental anti-influenza studies are 
 <italic>Sambucus nigra</italic> (14.3%, out of 35 taxa), 
 <italic>Olea europaea</italic> (11.4%), followed by 
 <italic>Eucalyptus camaldulensis, E. globules, Melissa officinalis and Origanum vulgare</italic> (8.6%). The reason for this may be that these plants are easily accessible in nature or from the virtual market environment, and can be obtained for less money.

 <italic>Centaurea drabifolia</italic> subsp 
 <italic>floccosa</italic> (an endemic taxon), which have been detected in this study to be used in the treatment of malaria. These fifteen plants are presented in
