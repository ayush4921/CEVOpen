<p>The use of various gases in the liquid or supercritical state as extracting solvents has been under research for nearly half of a century. A large number of natural products have been extracted with carbon dioxide, and commercial plants in the food industry have already been well established. Supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) of oregano leaves is suggested to concentrate and isolate antioxidant extracts to be used as functional food ingredients. The extraction process has been evaluated in terms of both the quality and the activity of the antioxidant products obtained. LC–MS with electrospray has been used, along with a diode array detector, to characterize the extracts in terms of chemical composition; antioxidant activities have been measured using two different in vitro assays; 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) antiradical test and bleaching β-carotene method.</p>
