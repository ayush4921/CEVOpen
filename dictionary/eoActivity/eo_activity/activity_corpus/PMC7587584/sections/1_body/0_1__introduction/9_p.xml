<p>The solvent of choice must be featured with a low viscosity in order to accelerate mass transfer. At an elevated temperature, the viscosity of the solvent is reduced and the surface tension of the solvent is decreased, which results in a higher extraction rate. Extraction conditions are adjusted in order to obtain the highest yields of volatile substances, and the influence of the extraction conditions and the precision of the method are examined. Carvacrol, terpinen-4-ol, linalool, sabinene, α-terpinene and γ-terpinene (
