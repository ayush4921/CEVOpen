<p>The essential oil of

 <xref rid="B105-molecules-25-04735" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Carvacrol, 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, Î±-terpinene and thymol have been identified as the major compounds of oregano essential oil which is recognized as a natural antimicrobial agent with a strong potential for food preservation. Their antimicrobial effect against food-borne pathogens including gram-positive bacteria such as 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> and gram-negative 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> is initialized by making the cell membrane permeable due to its impregnation in the hydrophobic domains. This effect is greater against gram-positive bacteria such as 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>. Gram-negative 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> is a large group of bacteria found in the environment, foods and intestines of people and animals, and for that reason, is a subject of several studies. Oregano essential oil has antioxidant properties effective in retarding the process of lipid peroxidation in fatty foods, and scavenging free radicals. In this perspective, the present subchapter analyzes and discusses the state of the actual and potential uses of oregano essential oil as antimicrobial and antioxidant food additives. The intense aroma of oregano essential oil influences organoleptic characteristics of food products. A lot of research has been dedicated to settle the compromise between the beneficial antimicrobial and antioxidant properties and minimizing the undesired sensory effects.
