<p>Antimicrobial activities of the essential oils derived from plants have gained the attention of researchers as they might represent an alternative to the increasing resistance of conventional antibiotics against pathogen infections. Many researchers have been oriented towards the antimicrobial activity of essential oils against a wide range of microorganisms, and particularly against common food pathogens [

 <xref rid="molecules-25-04735-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. Oregano essential oil was one of the first natural antiseptics used, proving a good bactericide effect against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria as well as showing both antifungal and antioxidant activity. The main advantage of these natural products is that they do not enhance antibiotic resistance, as seen with the long-term use of synthetic antibiotics. On the other hand, the ability of plant essential oils to protect foods against pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms with the benefit of being natural products and thus more acceptable by the consumers, has been reported by several researchers [
