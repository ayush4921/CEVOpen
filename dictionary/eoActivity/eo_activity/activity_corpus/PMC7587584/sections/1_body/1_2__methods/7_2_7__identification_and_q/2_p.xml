<p>However, techniques employing high-resolution mass spectrometry are still under intense examination, thus the data on identification of the phenolic profile by high-resolution mass spectrometry are still relatively limited. These methods, comprising linear ion trap (LIT) mass spectrometry—which provides single stage mass analysis that supplies molecular mass information, tandem mass analysis (MS/MS) and multi-staged tandem mass spectrometry (MS
 <sup>n</sup>) that provide structural information—have been demonstrated as a reliable tool for the structural elucidation of unknown compounds in complex mixtures such as the total plant extracts. Flavonoids in the oregano extracts were analyzed using a high-pressure liquid chromatography-diode array detection-electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-ESI/MS) screening method [
