<p>Supercritical fluid extraction using carbon dioxide or subcritical water as a solvent meet the safety and environmental requirements and are therefore considered as clean and benign processes. Over steam distillation or conventional organic solvent extraction, extraction involving sub- and supercritical fluids, features several advantages. This includes the elimination of the organic solvents and the residue in the products and the capability to use lower temperatures, leading to less deterioration of the thermally-labile components in the extract. Supercritical fluid extraction of oregano leaves is suggested to concentrate and isolate antioxidant extracts to be used as functional food ingredients. Namely, the technique is suitable to retain the organoleptic characteristics of the starting spice materials. Compressed carbon dioxide yields a high-quality extract at a competitive cost. The pretreatment of the herbaceous matrices, the extraction pressure and temperature and the solvent flow rate [

In that sense, the extraction process has been evaluated in terms of both the quality and the activity of the antioxidant products obtained. Supercritical fluid extraction is also frequently more selective than extraction with commonly used solvents which extract unwanted components (e.g., tannins, chlorophyll and minerals). Some authors have reported on the supercritical extraction of oregano leaves to obtain oregano essential oil and oleoresin [
