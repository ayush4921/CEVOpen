<p>Thermal treatment causes the degradation of polyphenols or undesirable oxidation. Since the phenolic yield in the extracts is significantly decreased by the long-term thermal treatment, high processing temperatures should therefore be avoided. Temperatures exceeding 70 Â°C are not desired and lead to a rapid anthocyanin degradation. A long extraction time is yet another problem facing the conventional extraction procedure. In addition, maceration and Soxhlet extraction are the typical and most widely used conventional extraction methods and are known for their low efficiency and potential environmental hazard due to their high demand for organic solvents. Indeed, among innovative process technologies, supercritical CO
 <sub>2</sub> extraction and fractionation is widely studied. Different authors compared supercritical extracts with those obtained by using liquid solvents (ethanol and hexane) or hydrodistillation, and described the superior functional activity of the supercritical extracts [
