<p>Solvent-free microwave extraction of essential oil from 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> L. was performed by Bayramoglu and co-workers [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-25-04735" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The effects of microwave power and extraction time on the yield and composition of the product were investigated. Solvent-free microwave extraction of 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> L. was compared with conventional hydrodistillation in terms of process time, yield, composition and physical properties of the essential oil obtained. Significantly higher essential oil yields were attained by solvent-free microwave extraction at higher power levels compared to conventional hydrodistillation. Required extraction time decreased significantly, whilst the compositions of the essential oil obtained by both methods were similar. Thymol (650â€“750 mg/mL) was identified as the major aroma compound.
