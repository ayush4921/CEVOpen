<p>The extracts of 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> possess compounds with antimicrobial and antifungal properties, as well as antioxidant activity, and therefore can be used as a natural preservative ingredient in food and/or pharmaceutical industry. It is known that most of their properties are due to the essential oils and other secondary plant metabolites. Essential oils enhance the production of digestive secretions, stimulate blood circulation, exert antioxidant properties, reduce levels of pathogenic bacteria and may enhance immune status. They have been used for several applications in pharmaceutical, cosmetic, agricultural and food industries. Extraction could be carried out by various techniques. Innovative methods avoid shortcomings of conventional techniques like chemical alteration risk, long extraction time and high-energy input. A complex mixture of flavonoids and phenolic acids is responsible for the potential bioactive properties and promising role as an alternative treatment in several illnesses. Interestingly, most of the studies are based on in vitro approaches, limiting its extrapolation to human health. A better knowledge of the mechanism of action and effects of individual compounds would be useful to formulate mixtures of compounds to enhance efficiency.
