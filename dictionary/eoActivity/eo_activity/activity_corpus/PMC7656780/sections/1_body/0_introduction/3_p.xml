<p>In this perspective article, we use Indian traditional medicine (Ayurveda) as an example, to search historic documents for evidence of biofilm-mediated infections, identify and reconstitute plant-based traditional remedies with anti-biofilm potential, and test them in the laboratory with standard biofilm assays. Based on gleanings across compendia, three plant-based remedies, of 
 <italic>Kalanchoe pinnata</italic> (Lam.) Pers. (“
 <italic>Parnabeeja</italic>”), 
 <italic>Ocimum tenuiflorum</italic> L. (Holy basil or “
 <italic>Tulsi</italic>”), and 
 <italic>Cynodon dactylon</italic> (L.) Pers. (Bermuda grass or “
 <italic>Durva</italic>”) were reconstituted in sesame oil, and “whole” remedies were tested for their effects on biofilm formation and eradication of pre-formed biofilms using 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> microtiter based biofilm assays. The three plant-based remedies showed varied inhibitory effects on biomass and metabolic activity of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilms, with sesame oil alone also showing anti-biofilm effects. Notably, comparison of the effects on biofilm and planktonic growth states revealed differential effects on the two modes of growth. We discuss our approach and results, and leverage them to provide insights into the considerations and challenges relevant to evaluating traditional remedies as anti-biofilm agents.
