<p>The biofilm inhibitory effects of the medicinal formulations could be attributed to the properties of ingredients, that include specific antimicrobial effects or interactions with the biofilm matrix (

 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Kerekes et al., 2019</xref>). One study that employed crystal violet-based microtiter assays to evaluate the effects of essential oils (thyme, cinnamon, marjoram) on biofilm formation allowed the bacteria to attach to the substrate for 4Â h, after which the oils were added (

Therefore, after an initial screening, the selected promising remedies can be further examined for the nature of their activity (bactericidal, bacteriostatic or matrix-modifying), and possible cytotoxicity, with
