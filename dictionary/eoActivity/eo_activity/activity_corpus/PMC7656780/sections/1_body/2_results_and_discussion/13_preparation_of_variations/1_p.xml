<p>The recipes also did not call for any specific type of metal container for remedy preparation, and we used a stainless steel pot. Leaching of trace amounts of metals (silver, aluminum, copper) from containers could contribute to the effects of formulations (

We also “modernized” the preparation practices to use a mechanized grinder (as opposed to physical grinding with rock or stone), to ensure we obtained a uniform, consistent paste. This could influence the “release” of ingredients into the plant paste, and use of a mortar and pestle could be an intermediate option. Similarly, the liquid component of the remedy recommends the use of water or milk, and we decided to use water. One way to account for these factors would be to prepare and test multiple variations of the traditional formulations.
