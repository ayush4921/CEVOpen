<p>Based on the results, the plant-based “whole” remedies display differential effects on biofilm formation and eradication of preformed biofilms for the two biofilm-forming wound pathogens. In the presence of sesame oil, and plant remedies KPE-SO, CDE-SO and OTE-SO, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> biofilms showed significantly decreased total biomass and metabolic activity, when compared with untreated biofilms. On the other hand, none of the three remedies, KPE-SO, CDE-SO and OTE-SO, or sesame oil alone, showed a significant effect on the biomass formation of 
 <italic>S. aureus.</italic> When treated with SO, KPE-SO and CDE-SO there was a significant reduction in the metabolic activity of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilms as compared to biofilms grown without treatment. Importantly, sesame oil alone is observed to have anti-biofilm effects.
