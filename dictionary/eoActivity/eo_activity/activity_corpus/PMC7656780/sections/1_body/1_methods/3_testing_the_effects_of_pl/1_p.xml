<p>To evaluate effects on eradication of pre-formed biofilms, reconstituted traditional remedies were added to 24-h old biofilms of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> or 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Overnight cultures of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> were diluted to a concentration of 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/ml in fresh LB broth, and 100 µl of this diluted culture was added to a 96-well plate such that each well contained 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells. The plate was incubated at 37°C under static conditions to allow biofilm formation on the bottom, sides and air-liquid interface of the wells. After 24 h, wells were washed gently (twice) with 150 µl of LB broth to remove any dead or planktonic cells, taking care not to disrupt the biofilm. Following this, 100 µl of SO, KPE-SO, CDE-SO and OTE-SO were added individually to respective wells. Controls were set up for each set of assays that included uninoculated LB broth (sterility control), and pre-formed biofilms treated with LB broth (untreated control). Plates were further incubated at 37°C under static conditions for 24 h. After 24 h, the metabolic activity of the biofilms was measured with the XTT assay; a critical read-out for antimicrobial effects against pre-formed biofilms is the ability to reduce the viable cell count.
