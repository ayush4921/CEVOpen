<p>The phytotoxicity of the 
 <italic>A. ochroleuca</italic> EO was performed against 
 <italic>L. sativa</italic> L. as a standard test plant, where it is known to be very sensitive to allelochemicals [
 <xref rid="B64-plants-09-00998" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] as well as the noxious weed 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic>. In brief, the seeds of lettuce were purchased from the Agriculture Research Center, Cairo, Egypt, while the seeds of 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> were collected from Taif, southeast Saudi Arabia. Seeds with uniform size and color were carefully chosen and surface-sterilized via sodium hypochlorite (0.3%). Prior to the experiment, the viability of the seed was performed by the germination of seeds in the Petri plate lined with a filter paper (Whatman No. 1) using distilled water at 25 °C with adjusted light conditions of 16/8 h light/dark cycle. The germination percentage was 97.23 ± 0.5% for 
 <italic>L. sativa</italic> and 90.12 ± 1.02% for 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic>.
