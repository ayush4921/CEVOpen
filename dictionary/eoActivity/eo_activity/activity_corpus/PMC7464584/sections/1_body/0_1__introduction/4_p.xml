<p>Up to our knowledge, there are no studies concerning the chemical constituents of 
 <italic>A. ochroleuca</italic> EO. We hypothesized that 
 <italic>A. ochroleuca</italic> is a weed, but it may contain phytotoxic constituents such as EOs that could be used as bioherbicides against other weeds; thus, if EO of 
 <italic>A. ochroleuca</italic> has potent herbicidal activity, it could be a possible way to integrate this oil as bioherbicide and make use of this plant. Therefore, the present work provided for the first time (i) the chemical profile of EO of 
 <italic>A. ochroleuca</italic> as well as (ii) the potential phytotoxic activity of this EO against the test plant 
 <italic>Lactuca sativa</italic> L. and the noxious weed 
 <italic>Peganum harmala</italic> L.
