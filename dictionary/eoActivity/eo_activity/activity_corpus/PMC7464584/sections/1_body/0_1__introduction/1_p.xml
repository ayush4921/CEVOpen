<p>Plants are promising natural resources for essential oils (EOs) with a complex mixture of secondary metabolites, including mono-, sesqui-, and di-terpenoids, in addition to hydrocarbons [

 <xref rid="B2-plants-09-00998" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The chemical compounds of EOs were biosynthesized via the different isoprenoid pathways [
