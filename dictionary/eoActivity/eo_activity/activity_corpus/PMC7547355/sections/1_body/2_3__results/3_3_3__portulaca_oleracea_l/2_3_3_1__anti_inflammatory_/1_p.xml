<p>The hydroethanolic extracts (10, 40, and 160 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) of 
 <italic>P. oleracea</italic> significantly increases anti-inflammatory cytokine (IFN-
 <italic>γ</italic>) in nonstimulated and stimulated human lymphocytes cells. In stimulated lymphocytes, the extract of 
 <italic>P. oleracea</italic> significantly decreases inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-10, and free radicals such as NO [
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. The aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>P. oleracea</italic> (10, 25, 50, and 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) in a dose-dependent manner significantly inhibit TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>-induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. 
 <italic>P. oleracea</italic> also suppressed the TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>-induced degradation of I
 <italic>κ</italic>B-
 <italic>α</italic> and reduces the TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>-induced NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B binding protein in the vascular endothelial cells. The plant extracts also effectively reduce the mRNA expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and IL-8 induced by TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> [
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. The ethanol extract of 
 <italic>P. oleracea</italic> inhibited the production of inflammatory mediators such as NO and proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>, and IL-6 in LPS-induced inflammation in RAW 264.7 cells (derived from BALB/c mice). 
 <italic>P. oleracea</italic> extracts also inhibited the phosphorylation of (ERK1/2), c-Jun NH
 <sub>2</sub>-terminal kinase (JNK), and NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B activation in cells [
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. POL-P3b as a polysaccharide fraction purified extracted from 
 <italic>P. oleracea</italic> upregulates the expression of CD80, CD86, and CD83 and stimulates production of IL-12 and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> in large quantities and IL-10 in small quantities by improving the maturation and function of murine bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs). Furthermore, POL-P3b significantly increased the expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) on DCs treated. The findings confirm that POL-P3b is able to induce DCs maturation through TLR-4 [
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. The oral administration of 
 <italic>P. oleracea</italic> polysaccharides significantly and dose-dependently increases stimulation indices (SI) of T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes in Wistar rats [
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. The polysaccharide (POP) from 
 <italic>P. oleracea</italic> shows the preventive effect on the reduction of the spleen weight and the number of murine spleen T cells after 30 days of inducing age in the mice with D-galactose [
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. 
 <italic>P. oleracea</italic> (50–200 mg/kg) significantly reduces IL-
 <italic>β</italic>, IL-6, TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, PGE
 <sub>2</sub>, and TGF-
 <italic>β</italic> and increases IL-10 levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of lung treated by lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced inflammation [
