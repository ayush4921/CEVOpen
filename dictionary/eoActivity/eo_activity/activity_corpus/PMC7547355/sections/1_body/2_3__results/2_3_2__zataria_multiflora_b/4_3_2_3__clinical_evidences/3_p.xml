<p>A similar study showed that 
 <italic>Z. multiflora</italic> was able to significantly lower serum levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>), monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and epidermal growth factor (EGF) and also improve PFT test values and respiratory symptoms in the SM exposed patients [

 <italic>Z. multiflora</italic> (5 and 10 mg/kg/day) significantly improves clinical symptoms, PFTs values, oxidative stress, and cytokine levels in asthmatic patients two months after treatment compared to baseline [

 <italic>Z. multiflora</italic> for prevention and treatment of respiratory disease in adults and children.
