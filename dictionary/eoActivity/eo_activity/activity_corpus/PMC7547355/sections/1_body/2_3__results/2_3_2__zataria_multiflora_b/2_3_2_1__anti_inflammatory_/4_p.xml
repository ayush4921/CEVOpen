<p>Pretreatment of LPS‐stimulated murine macrophages with essential oils extracted from 
 <italic>Z. multiflora,</italic> including 52% carvacrol, 16% thymol, and 10% 
 <italic>p</italic>‐cymene, leads to a significant reduction in H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and nitric oxide (NO) production. This effect is mediated by inhibition of oxidative stress process or by radical scavenging activity of phenolic groups of the essential oil such as thymol and carvacrol. Therefore, 
 <italic>Z. multiflora</italic> extract or its essential oil can be used in the therapy of oxidative damage induced by inflammation [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The findings prove that 
 <italic>Z. multiflora</italic> has potential of reduction in inflammation by reduce in H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, NO, differential WBC, and phospholipase A2 production.
