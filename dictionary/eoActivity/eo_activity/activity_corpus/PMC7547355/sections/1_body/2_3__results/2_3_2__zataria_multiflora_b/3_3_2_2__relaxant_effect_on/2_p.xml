<p>Long-term administration of 
 <italic>Z. multiflora</italic> hydroethanolic extract also caused a reduction in tracheobronchial hyperresponsiveness in animal model of asthma [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and COPD [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The possible antagonistic effect of the hydroethanolic extract of 
 <italic>Z. multiflora</italic> on muscarinic receptors of incubated tracheal chains with propranolol and chlorpheniramine versus to those of nonincubated tissue was investigated [
