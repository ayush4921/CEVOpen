<p>KCL but not acetylcholine induced uterus muscle contraction was reversed by 
 <italic>Z. multiﬂora</italic> extract (2 mg/ml) which is more potent than the atropine effect [
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Because KCl induced muscle contraction is mediated by voltage-dependent calcium channel, these findings support a calcium channel blocking effect for the 
 <italic>Z. multiﬂora</italic> extract.
