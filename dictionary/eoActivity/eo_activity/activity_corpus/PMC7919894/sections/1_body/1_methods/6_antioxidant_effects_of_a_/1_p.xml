<p>Oxidative stress is characterised by over production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) (Karimian et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). These free radicals, mainly nitric oxide, superoxide anion, hydroxyl radical and hydrogen peroxide, can cause oxidative damages to nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids. Thus, excess production of free radicals under pro-inflammatory conditions may initiate various diseases (Kim et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Rezaee et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0103" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Ghorani et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Natural antioxidants are compounds that can delay or inhibit oxidative reactions by scavenging free radicals. The most important of these compounds are phenolic acids, polyphenols, flavonoids, alkaloids and terpenoids (Del Bano et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Amidi et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Kim IS et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Therefore, suppression of oxidative stress could be achieved by using potential sources of natural antioxidants such as medicinal plants (Zarei et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0139" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Parhiz et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0099" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Boskabady et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Hashemzaei et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Essential oils derived from these plants, are rich sources of antioxidant components with different biological activities (Hasani-Ranjbar et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> contains high levels of phenolic compounds mainly flavonoids, which have antioxidant properties besides other pharmacological effects such as antibiotic, antidiabetic, anti-atherogenic and anticancer activities (Helen et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Liguori et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0079" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Flavones, flavanones, flavonols, isoflavones, flavanonols, chalcones, and anthocyanins which are subclasses of flavonoids and flavonols, are the most abundant flavonoids in 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> (Liguori et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0079" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Several studies reported the antioxidant activities of 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> and its constituents and introduced the plant as a potential source of natural antioxidants (Razavi and Kenari 
 <xref rid="CIT0101" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Roldán et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0107" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Ola-Mudathir and Maduagwu 
 <xref rid="CIT0094" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Alterations in oxidant/antioxidant markers including lipid peroxidation (LPO), glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and MDA were observed by studies that investigated the effects of 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> and its constituents (Dadkhah et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).
