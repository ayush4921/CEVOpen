<p>Two groups of chemicals that are abundant in onions and have health benefits to humans, include flavonoids and alkenyl cysteine sulphoxides (Griffiths et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). About 31 unique proteins in the lower epidermis (LE) and upper epidermis (UE) of the scales of onion bulb were identified which involved in pigment synthesis, stress response, and cell division. Differences in chalcone-flavanone isomerase and flavone 
 <italic>O</italic>-methyltransferase 1-like in LE of the onion scale, were shown to be responsible for red and yellow colours of onions. Also, differences in UDP-arabinopyranose mutase 1-like protein and β-1,3-glucanase in the LE, may be related to the differences in cell sizes in LE and UE of red and yellow onions (Wu et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0135" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). It was also shown that onions contain allylsulfides and flavonoids including quercetin which exert antioxidative activities and could reduce hepatocytes apoptosis; also, onion contains steroid saponins and sapogenins, and β-chlorogenin which is a characteristic steroid sapogenin. The other constituents of 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> are organosulfur compounds, including DATS, diallyl disulphide (DADS), ajoene, and sallylmercaptocysteine (SAMC), with cell cycle arrest effect in cancer cells (Upadhyay
