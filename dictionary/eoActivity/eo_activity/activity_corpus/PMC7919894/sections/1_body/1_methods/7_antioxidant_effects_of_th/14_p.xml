<p>Treatment of STZ-induced diabetic Wistar rats with aqueous extract of onion (0.4 g/mL/day) resulted in reduction of lipid hydroperoxide and lipoperoxide concentrations but did not alter GPx (Campos et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Also, the level of free radicals was diminished in plasma and tissues of alloxan-induced diabetic rats after administration of onion extract (El-Demerdash et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) which was in agreement with previous studies (Baynes and Thorpe 
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Kumari and Augusti 
 <xref rid="CIT0070" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Campos and co-workers (
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>) examined the effects of the consumption of onion extract (40 g/100 mL for 30 days) in STZ-induced diabetic Wistar rats. It was shown that onion intake reduced SOD activity and prevented the increment of lipid hydroperoxide and lipoperoxide concentrations in treated diabetic rats. The antioxidant potential of the ethanol extract and fractions of aerial parts of A
 <italic>. cepa</italic> was examined by Baragob et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), in 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments used DPPH and NO radical scavenging methods, whereas the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> effects on antioxidant enzyme were investigated in the erythrocytes and pancreas of normal and STZ-induced diabetic albino rats. Before treatment, compared to diabetic groups, normal groups had higher levels of SOD, CAT, GSH but lower LPO level, while administration of 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> ethanol extract (200 mg/kg/day for 21 days) and its chloroform fraction, significantly augmented the levels of SOD, CAT and GSH and declined LPO level to near normal levels, in the diabetic groups.
