<p>Razavi and Kenari (
 <xref rid="CIT0101" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) reported the relationship between phenolic content and antioxidant activity of red onion peel extract using two methods of inhibition of free radical DPPH and β-carotene-linoleate bleaching assay. The results revealed that onion extract has a great antioxidant capacity and exhibited a significant relation between phenolic content and antioxidant activity of the plant. Furthermore, Lee et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0075" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) showed that Sprague-Dawley rats treated with red onion diet containing 5% red onion flesh for 4 weeks, exerted an elevation in the plasma SOD and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity.
