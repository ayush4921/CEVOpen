<p>Treatment with quercetin (0.1%) for 8 weeks, suppressed hepatic expression of TNF-α and IL-6 and decreased inflammation in high-fat diet/streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic male Sprague-Dawley rats (Jung et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). It was also reported that quercetin was more effective in inhibiting inflammation processes compared to onion itself (Simin et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0118" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> studies showed that 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> extract and quercetin down-regulated NF-κB level and inhibited osteoclastogenesis in inflammatory conditions induced by LPS (Oliveira, Figueiredo et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0097" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The anti-inflammatory activities of quercetin were attributed to its inhibitory effects on production of eicosanoids like thromboxane B2 (TXB2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and 12 (

 <italic>A. cepa</italic> (10, 100 and 1000 µM) and quercetin (3.5, 7.5 and 15 µM) also reduced the level of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, −5 and −13 in the BALF in a murine model of asthma (Oliveira, Campos et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0096" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Some reports showed that allyl methyl disulphide (100 µM) from garlic had an anti-inflammatory effect on human colon cancer cell lines HT-29 and Caco-2 by increasing IL-8/IP-10 formation and suppressing IL-8 mRNA level in intestinal epithelial cells. Active butanolic fraction of ethanol extract of dried and grounded onion, quercetin and luteolin showed anti-inflammatory properties comparable to ibuprofen in rat peritoneal mast cells, and anti-edematogenic effect in the early phase of carrageenan-induced paw edoema (Zhang et al.
