<p>Quercetin (0, 0.1, 1, 10, 25 and 50 µM) significantly suppressed nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) induced by receptor activator of NF-κΒ ligand (RANKL) in MC3T3-E1 preosteoblastic cell line (Yamaguchi and Weitzmann

This compound decreased the production of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1α, IL-4, and TNF-α and inhibited the proliferation and activity of lymphocytes. In addition, quercetin reduced TNF-α/IL-10 and IL-8/IL-10 ratios in animal and human studies (Lanzotti
