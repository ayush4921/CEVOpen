<p>Gawlik-Dziki et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) measured the antioxidant potential of bread enriched with 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> skin. The food supplement was prepared by drying onions (‘Wolska’) in an oven at 50 °C followed by powdering the plant material using a laboratory mill. In these experiments, the flour used in the formula of control bread (wheat bread flour 600 g, type 750) was replaced with onion skin at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5% levels. Bio-accessibility and bio-availability were determined 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> using a human gastrointestinal tract model. Breads were then enriched with 80% methanol extract and antioxidant activity was measured in terms of antiradical activity, potential to suppress lipid peroxidation, metal chelating activity and ferric reducing power. The antioxidant activity of onion-supplemented bread was significantly higher than that seen for the control. Also, Helen et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>) mentioned that 100 mg/kg onion oil given for 21 days is a potent antioxidant against oxidative injury caused by nicotine in Sprague-Dawley rats and its antioxidant activity was comparable to that of vitamin E.
