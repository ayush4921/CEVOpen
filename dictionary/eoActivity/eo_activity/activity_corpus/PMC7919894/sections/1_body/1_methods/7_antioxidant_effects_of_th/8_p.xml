<p>In a Sprague-Dawley rat model, the antioxidant effect of 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> oil on nicotine-induced damages was compared to vitamin E. The results showed that 100 mg/kg/day onion oil given for 21 days led to significant increases in antioxidants (SOD, CAT and GSH) levels suggesting that 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> is an effective antioxidant against oxidative damage induced by nicotine (Helen et al.
