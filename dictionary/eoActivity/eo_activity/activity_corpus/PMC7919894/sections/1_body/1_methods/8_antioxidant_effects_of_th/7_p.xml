<p>Ouyang et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0098" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) showed DPPH radical-scavenging, FRAP radical scavenging, and OH radical scavenging activities of polyphenols from onion with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 43.24, 560.61, and 12.97 μg/mL, respectively. In addition, these polyphenols significantly inhibited xanthine oxidase activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 17.36 μg/mL. Insani et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) showed a positive correlation between total antioxidant activity and content of polyphenols particularly quercetin, suggesting that phenolic compounds have a major role in antioxidant properties of this plant. In another study, assessment of relationship between bioactive compounds content and antioxidant activities of 6 
 <italic>Allium</italic> vegetable species, revealed that chive onion had the highest antioxidant activity compared to others. A significant positive correlation between phenolic content and antioxidant activity was also shown (Beretta et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Antioxidant effects of skin of 15 Indian cultivars onion showed the maximum antioxidant capacity for cv. ‘NHRDF Red’ whereas the least capacity was obtained for cv. ‘Bhima Shubhra’ (Sagar et al.
