<p>The oxygen radical scavenging capacity of 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> was also reported (Kim et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Pulp and skin of onion were extracted using distilled water and 95% ethyl alcohol. The highest ORAC value and total phenolic content were detected for the ethyl alcohol extract of onion skin. Lee et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0076" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) evaluated the antioxidant properties of four different extracts of 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> peels. Plant material was extracted by hot ethanol (60 °C), and hot water (80 °C) and by means of subcritical water extraction at 110 and 165 °C. The ethanol onion peel extract showed a better DPPH radical scavenging activity and a higher antioxidant activity compared to the other samples as determined by ferric thiocyanate assay.
