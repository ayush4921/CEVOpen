<p>The bulb extract of 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> (35, 70, and 140 mg/kg/day for 21 days) significantly reduced total WBC and lung inflammatory cells such as neutrophil, eosinophil and monocyte counts, but led to a significant increase in lymphocytes counts in asthmatic Wistar rats (Ghorani et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) and the extract resulted in relaxation of tracheal smooth muscle (Memarzia et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0086" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Also, the extract of onion reduced lung inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, 5, and 13 and T helper 2 in BALF of asthmatic animals. These findings suggested therapeutic potential of 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> in the treatment of allergic disorders such as asthma (Oliveira, Campos et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0096" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Chloroform extracts of yellow onion bulbs (0.3, 1, 3, 10 and 30 µM) inhibited M2 receptor in human monocyte-derived macrophages and suppressed the expression of CD163 which is involved in inflammation processes (El-Aasr et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Methanol extract of the outer scales and edible parts of 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> bulb (100 and 200 mg/kg) showed protective effects on the infarct volume after cerebral ischaemia as reflected by a marked decrease in inflammation cascade in Swiss albino mice (Shri and Bora 
 <xref rid="CIT0116" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Onion peel hot water extract (0.1, 1, 10, 50, 100 µg/mL) administered to BALB/c mice, produced considerable anti-inflammatory activities as it could suppress the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1-β (Kang et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). It was shown that fresh onion juice (10 mg/kg) inhibited both acute and chronic pain and significantly decreased hind-paw thickness in male albino mice (Nasri et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0089" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Steam distillate from freeze-dried 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> (methanol and water) attenuated 15-lipoxygenase type I activity which is an inflammatory mediator (Takahashi and Shibamoto 
 <xref rid="CIT0125" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Alcohol, chloroform and water extract of bulbs of 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> (300 mg/kg) showed wound healing activities in Wister albino rats which indicated the effect of the plant on initial phases of wound formation as an acute inflammatory process (Shenoy et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0113" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).
