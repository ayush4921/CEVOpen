<p>Cadmium, as a nephrotoxic agent, causes kidney damage through induction of oxidative stress. Preventive effect of

 <italic>A. cepa</italic> on cyanide-induced renal toxicity, were assessed in Wistar rats. Significant increases in antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT and GSH) and a significant reduction of MDA and LPO in the kidney, were observed in rats treated for 14 days with 600 mg/kg/day onion extract (Ola-Mudathir and Maduagwu
