<p>The results of the above studies indicated the effect of 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> and its constituents such polyphenolics and flavonoids mainly quercetin, in inflammatory disorders of cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neuronal respiratory and urogenital systems. The anti-inflammatory effects of the plant and its constituents were mediated via modulation of different inflammatory cells and mediators. Reduction of total WBC, neutrophils and eosinophil counts and inhibition of chemotaxis of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, were reported in this context. The plant and its constituents showed inhibitory effects on COX and LOX pathways and prevented formation of leukotrienes and thromboxanes (such as TXB2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and 12-HHT. Inhibitory effects of 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> and its constituents onVCAM-1, NF-κB, MARK,d STAT-1, JNK, p38 and osteoclastogenesis as well as downregulation of PPAR-γ were also shown. The results also indicated that the anti-inflammatory effects of the plant is due to its constituents mainly quercetin. The anti-inflammatory effects of 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> and its constituents are shown in
