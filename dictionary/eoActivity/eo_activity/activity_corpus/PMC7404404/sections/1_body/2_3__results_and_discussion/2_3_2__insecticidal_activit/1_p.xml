<p>The contact toxicity of 
 <italic>L. taraxacifolia</italic> against 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic> revealed considerable differences in insect mortality rate to the essential oil with different concentrations and different exposure times. 
 <xref rid="foods-09-00914-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows that at a dose of 10.00 μL/mL, the volatile oil produced 25.00% mortality after 48 h (not significantly different than the negative EtOH control) and 52.50% after 120 h (significantly higher toxicity than the EtOH control). The essential oil produced 30.00%, 47.50%, 60.00%, and 75.00% mortality after 48, 72, 96, and 120 h at a dose of 20.00 μL/mL, respectively, while a dose of 30.00 μL/mL yielded a mortality rate of 42.50%, 57.50%, 75.00%, and 75.00%, respectively, over the same period of time. With longer contact times (≥48 h), 20 μL/mL and 30 μL/mL concentrations of 
 <italic>L. taraxacifolia</italic> essential oil was significantly more toxic than the EtOH control, but less toxic than the permethrin positive control. The highest concentration of 40.00 μL/mL produced a mortality of 97.50%, and 100.00% after 96 and 120 h, respectively, which is significantly comparable to the permethrin positive control. Permethrin (0.6% w/w) against 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic> caused 40.0% mortality with 24 h of exposure and 100.0% mortality after 48 h. The negative control showed no appreciable activity against 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic> until after 120 h.
