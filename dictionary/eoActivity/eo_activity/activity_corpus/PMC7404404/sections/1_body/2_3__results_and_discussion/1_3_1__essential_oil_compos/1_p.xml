<p>The essential oil from 
 <italic>L. taraxacifolia</italic> was obtained by hydrodistillation with a yield of 1.68% as a pale-yellow essential oil, which was analyzed by GC-MS. The chemical composition of the leaf volatile oil of 
 <italic>L. taraxacifolia</italic> is listed in 
 <xref rid="foods-09-00914-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. A total of 29 compounds were identified, accounting for 100% of the essential oil composition. The major chemical classes were monoterpene hydrocarbons (78%) and oxygenated monoterpenoids (16.2%), followed by sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (2.1%), oxygenated sesquiterpenoids (0.3%), and non-terpenoid derivatives (3.3%). The leaf essential oil was dominated by monoterpene hydrocarbons including limonene (48.8%), sabinene (18.8%), and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-Î²-ocimene (4.6%), along with the monoterpenoid aldehyde citronellal (11.0%). The chemical constituents of 
 <italic>L. taraxaciflora</italic> essential oil have not been previously reported to the best of our knowledge. However, a phytochemical study and antioxidant and bacterial screening of the leaf extract of 
 <italic>L. taraxacifolia</italic> have been reported [
