<p>The chemical composition of 
 <italic>L. taraxacifolia</italic> essential oil was determined by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) using a Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 Ultra operated in the electron impact (EI) mode (electron energy = 70 eV), scan range = 40–400 atomic mass units, with a scan rate of 3.0 scans per s, with GC-MS solution software. The GC column was a ZB-5 fused silica capillary column (30 m length × 0.25 mm inner diameter) with a 5% phenyl-polymethylsiloxane stationary phase and a film thickness of 0.25 μm. Helium gas was used as a carrier gas with column head pressure of 552 kPa at a flow rate of 1.37 mL/min. The injector temperature was 250 °C and the ion source temperature was 200 °C. The oven temperature of 50 °C was initially programmed for the GC and gradually increased at 2 °C/min to 260 °C. The sample (5% w/v) was dissolved in dichloromethane and 0.1 μL of the solution was injected using a split injection technique (30:1). Identification of the essential oil components was achieved by comparing the retention indices determined with respect to a homologous series of 
 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes, and by comparison of the mass spectral fragmentation patterns with those stored in the MS databases [
