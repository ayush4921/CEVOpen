<p>This study investigated the essential oil composition and evaluated the insecticidal potential of 
 <italic>L. taraxacifolia</italic> leaves for the first time as a potential substitute to synthetic insecticides. 
 <italic>L. taraxacifolia</italic> offers an advantage in Nigeria due to its accessibility and renewability. Despite many advantages of medicinal plants, especially the essential oils, further studies need to be conducted to ascertain the safety of this essential oil before its practical use as an insecticide for controlling stored product insect pests. In addition, while the insecticidal properties of 
 <italic>L. taraxacifolia</italic> essential oil are promising, this work is preliminary and future investigations extrapolating the use of the essential oil under grain-storage conditions should be pursued. In addition, studies on the controlled-release formulations of the essential oil could be examined to curb some of the challenges of essential oil treatments such as rapid degradation, volatility, and low bioavailability of the essential oils.
