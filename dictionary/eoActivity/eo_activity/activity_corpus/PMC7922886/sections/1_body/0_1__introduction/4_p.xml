<p>Based on the results of our preliminary screenings performed as several combinations of different EOs (
 <italic>Cinnamomum cassia</italic>, 
 <italic>C. verum</italic>, 
 <italic>Cymbopogon flexuosus</italic>, 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic>, 
 <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic>, and 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic>) against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> of the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 29213 (the lowest fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) values in the vapor phase ranged from 0.59 to 1.25), the combination of 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> EO with 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> EO was selected for more detailed evaluation due to its lowest FIC values that it had produced (unpublished data). Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine the antibacterial combinatory potential of EOs hydrodistilled from 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> and 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> against standard strains and clinical isolates of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> in both the vapor and liquid phases. Since the methods currently available for the determination of antimicrobial interactions of EOs in the vapor phase are based on disk diffusion assay, which yields only qualitative information about the antimicrobial agent combination, the accuracy of these techniques is limited because it is difficult to distinguish indifferent from synergistic interaction. For this reason, the validation of the qualitative broth volatilization checkerboard method for testing of combinatory antimicrobial effect of two different EOs was an additional objective of this study.
