 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> L. (oregano) and 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> L. (thyme) are aromatic spice herbs belonging to the Lamiaceae family. They are native to the Mediterranean region and neighboring countries [

 <xref rid="B17-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and in folk medicine, they have been used as remedies to treat respiratory disorders (e.g., coughs and bronchitis) as expectorants, dyspepsia as well as urinary tracts disorders [
 <xref rid="B16-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Although the principal components of oregano and thyme EOs are carvacrol and thymol, respectively, their chemical compositions vary depending on geographical region and season of collection [
 <xref rid="B20-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Both plants are also used in pharmaceutical industries, including the products for the treatment of respiratory infections. For example, the extract of 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> is used in two oral over-the-counter products Bronchipret Saft and Bronchipret TP (Bionorica, Neumarkt, Germany), which are used for the treatment of respiratory tract illnesses, cough, and bronchitis [
 <xref rid="B21-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Furthermore, EOs derived from these plants have been shown to exhibit a broad range of considerable biological activities, including their antimicrobial effect, which has been mostly attributable to the presence of phenolic compounds, such as carvacrol and thymol [
 <xref rid="B22-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]; however, other minor constituents such as monoterpene hydrocarbons 
 <italic>Î³</italic>-terpinene and 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene contribute to the antibacterial activity of the oils as well [
 <xref rid="B22-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. To date, numerous studies concerned with the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> and 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> EOs have been published. Differences between the antimicrobial activities of various chemotypes of these oils have been described [
 <xref rid="B25-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Furthermore, it was also proved that the antimicrobial effect of these EOs might be comparable to their main component alone [
 <xref rid="B27-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Due to their antimicrobial properties, EOs (including 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> and 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> EOs) could be used as alternatives to conventional antimicrobial agents, especially against antibiotic-resistant pathogens [
 <xref rid="B24-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. So far, numerous studies regarding the antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> and 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> EOs alone against a wide range of microorganisms, including 
 <italic>S. aureus,</italic> have been published [
 <xref rid="B28-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Both EOs have also previously been tested against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> in combination with other EOs [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] as well as with classic/conventional antibiotics [
 <xref rid="B33-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Moreover, their synergistic and additive inhibitory activity with each other has previously been reported against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> as well [
 <xref rid="B34-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, although there are numerous articles on the antistaphylococcal activity of 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> and 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> EOs tested in the broth and agar, substantially fewer articles dealing with their antibacterial effects against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> have been published using the vapor phase [
 <xref rid="B36-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, the combinatory antistaphylococcal activity of 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> EO and 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> EO have not previously been studied in the gaseous phase.
