<p>Mueller–Hinton (MH) broth was used as a cultivation medium, and both MH agar and MH broth purchased from Oxoid (Basingstoke, Hampshire, UK) were used as assay media. The pH of cation-adjusted MH broth was equilibrated to a final value of 7.6 with Trizma base (Sigma-Aldrich, Prague, Czech Republic). Stock cultures of bacterial strains were cultivated in broth medium at 37 °C for 24 h prior to the testing. The bacterial suspension’s turbidity used for the inoculation of both plate and lid, was adjusted to 0.5 McFarland standard by Densi-La-Meter II (Lachema, Brno, Czech Republic) to reach the final concentration of 10
 <sup>7</sup> CFU/mL.
