<p>The combinatory effect of EOs was determined based on the value of ΣFIC. For the combination of agent A (
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> EO) and agent B (
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> EO), the ΣFIC was calculated according to the following equation: ΣFIC = FIC
 <sub>A</sub> + FIC
 <sub>B</sub>, where FIC
 <sub>A</sub> = MIC
 <sub>A (in combination with B)</sub> /MICA 
 <sub>(alone)</sub>, and FIC
 <sub>B</sub> = MIC
 <sub>B (in combination with A)</sub> /MICB 
 <sub>(alone)</sub> and evaluated according to EUCAST [
 <xref rid="B50-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The ΣFIC index was interpreted as follows: synergistic interaction if ΣFIC ≤ 0.5; additive effect if ΣFIC &gt; 0.5 and ≤ 1; indifferent if ΣFIC &gt; 1 and &lt; 2; and antagonistic if ΣFIC ≥ 2.
