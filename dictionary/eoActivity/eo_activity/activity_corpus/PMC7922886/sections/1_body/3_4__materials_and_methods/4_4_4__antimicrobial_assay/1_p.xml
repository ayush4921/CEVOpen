<p>The in vitro antibacterial combinatory potential of 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> EO in combination with 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> EO in the liquid and vapor phase was determined using a broth volatilization checkerboard assay previously developed in our laboratory [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The method is based on the combination of classical microdilution checkerboard test and broth microdilution volatilization technique [
 <xref rid="B16-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], allowing the determination of interactions between EOs and/or plant volatile agents simultaneously in liquid and vapor phase as well as comparison of MIC values and calculation of FICs in both liquid and solid media. Experiments were performed in white, 96-well immunoplates (total well volume = 400 µL) covered by tight-fitting lids with flanges designed to reduce evaporation (SPL Life Sciences, Naechon-Myeon, Korea). In the first part of the procedure, 30 µL of agar was pipetted into every flange on the lid (with the exception of the outermost wells) and inoculated with 5 µL of the bacterial suspension. Subsequently, both 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> and 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> EOs were dissolved in DMSO and diluted in the broth medium to get the initial concentrations of 2048 µg/mL, with maximum DMSO content of 1%.
