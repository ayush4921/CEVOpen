<p>In summary, the present study reports the results of antistaphylococcal interactions between EOs obtained from 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> and 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> that were tested by broth volatilization checkerboard assay. This combination of volatile oils exhibited additive effects against all 12 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains in both liquid and vapor phases, whereas the best results in the liquid phase were obtained against methicillin-resistant strain (SA 2). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on interactions between 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> and 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> EOs against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> in the gaseous phase. In addition, the results presented in the form of isobologram, a graphical diagram enabling precise and intuitive judgment of the additive effect produced by EOs combination, validates the accuracy of broth volatilization checkerboard method for evaluation of the combinatory antimicrobial effect of EOs in the vapor phase. These results can potentially serve as a base for further research focused on the development of various pharmaceutical applications that are based on volatile microbials. However, since the MICs values obtained in the gaseous phase are only indicative and the real concentrations of evaporated EOs are lower, we believe that our results suggest a potential of thyme and oregano combination for application in the inhalation therapy against respiratory infections caused by 
 <italic>S. aureus.</italic> However, further research focusing on in vivo evaluation will have to be carried out in order to verify its potential practical use.
