<p>Since carvacrol and thymol have been found to be the most abundant compounds in our oregano and thyme EOs, respectively, the additive effects obtained by interactions between our volatile oils might be caused mainly by these two phenolic monoterpenoids. The presumption that the predominant component in both EOs is responsible for the antimicrobial activity of EOs can be supported by our previous research [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], whereas the range of MIC values of carvacrol (370–1593 μg/mL and 484–1024 μg/mL in agar and broth media) and thymol (341–1707 μg/mL and 355–1024 μg/mL in the vapor and liquid phases) were very similar to the MIC values of the 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> (427–796 μg/mL and 512–1024 μg/mL in agar and broth media) and 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> (427–796 μg/mL in the vapor phase and from 512–967 μg/mL in liquid phase) EOs tested in this study. The occurrence of additive interaction between carvacrol and thymol could be related to the similarity in their molecular structures (they are isomers), suggesting a similar mechanism of action [
 <xref rid="B72-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Both thymol and carvacrol are expected to cause functional and structural damages to the cytoplasmic membranes. The primary mechanism of antibacterial action of thymol is not fully known; however, it is believed to involve outer and inner membrane disruption and interaction with membrane proteins and intracellular targets. Similarly, the primary mechanism of action of carvacrol is its ability to position in the membrane where it increases permeability [
 <xref rid="B73-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. In both EOs tested in our study, the principal compounds, carvacrol, and thymol, were followed by their biosynthetic precursors 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene and 
 <italic>γ</italic>-terpinene, which, together with the main compound comprised more than 90% and 77% of the oregano and thyme oils. Their interaction within the tested EOs is presumable and might also contribute to the additive effects. This statement can be supported by Ultee et al. [
 <xref rid="B74-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], who reported synergistic activity between carvacrol and cymene against 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic>, or by Delgado et al. [
 <xref rid="B75-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>], who found synergistic effect against the same bacterium when cymene was combined with thymol. The additive antimicrobial effect of carvacrol and thymol has already been previously reported in several studies against different bacteria, including 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> in liquid [

 <xref rid="B77-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] as well as in the vapor phase [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, further research focused on a better understanding of antimicrobial interactions between major and minor components, which was suggested to play an important role in the synergistic activity of EO gases [
 <xref rid="B78-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] is warranted.
