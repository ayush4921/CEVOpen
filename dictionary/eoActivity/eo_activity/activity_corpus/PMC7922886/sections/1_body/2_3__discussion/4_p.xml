<p>The disc volatilization method is probably the most frequently used assay for the evaluation of in vitro growth inhibitory effect in the vapor phase. Both EOs have previously been tested individually against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> in the gaseous phase. For example, an investigation carried out by Nedorostova et al. [
 <xref rid="B37-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] determined antibacterial effects of EOs isolated from 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> and 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 25923 using modified disc volatilization method, and the MIC value of both EOs was 0.017 μg/cm
 <sup>3</sup>. Similarly, Kloucek et al. [
 <xref rid="B56-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] used a modified disc volatilization method to assess the antimicrobial activity of various EOs, including those of oregano and thyme. In this study, vapors of 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> EO containing 92% of carvacrol inhibited growth of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 25923 with MIC values 62.5 μL/L, whereas three EO samples of 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> with different chemical composition exhibited antimicrobial activity against the same staphylococcal strain with the MIC ranging from 125 to 250 μL/L. However, a thyme EO where thymol was the predominant compound was not active at all. A study performed by Lopez et al. (2007) [
 <xref rid="B36-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] determined the growth inhibitory effects of 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> and 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> vapors against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 29213 by a similar method and consequently calculated MIC causing apparent inhibition (17.5 μL/L and 87.3 μL/L, respectively) of the atmosphere above microorganisms. Subsequent research led by Reyes-Jurado et al. [
 <xref rid="B57-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] assessed the MIC values of 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> EO vapors against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and MRSA as &gt;5 μg/mL of air. However, although there has been increasing research interest in the antimicrobial activity of individual EO vapors in recent years, significantly fewer studies have been reported on their combinations. In the case of thyme and oregano EO vapors, to the best of our knowledge, the only study dealing with their combinatory effects in the gaseous phase was published by Cho et al. [
 <xref rid="B58-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], who reported synergistic activities of gaseous oregano and thyme EOs against 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> by modified checkerboard assay (FIC = 0.375). Our study is the first report on 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> and 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> interactions in the vapor phase against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>.
