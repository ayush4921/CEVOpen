<p>The detailed results of individual minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> and 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> EOs against 12 strains of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> including clinical isolates, as well as the MICs of their combinations with corresponding ΣFIC values are summarized in

 <xref rid="plants-10-00393-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> for the vapor and liquid phases, respectively. Results show that 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> EO exhibited an antistaphylococcal effect with MICs ranging from 427 to 796 μg/mL and from 512 to 1024 μg/mL in agar and broth media, respectively. Similar numbers were observed for 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> EO with MICs ranging from 427 to 796 μg/mL in the vapor phase and from 512 to 967 μg/mL in the liquid phase.
