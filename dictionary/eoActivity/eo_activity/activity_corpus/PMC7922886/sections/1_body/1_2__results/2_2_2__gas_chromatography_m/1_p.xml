<p>The yields of 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> and 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> EOs in the dried weight of plant materials (containing 14.42% and 13.68% of residual moisture) for 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> were 1.5% and 1.2% (
 <italic>v/w</italic>), respectively. The complete chemical compositions of oregano and thyme EOs are provided in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00393-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>; 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00393-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, respectively. In EOs isolated from 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> and 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic>, 19 and 28 components have been identified using an HP-5MS column, representing 99.78% and 99.26% of their respective total content. Using DB-HeawyWAX column, 25 and 34 compounds were determined, which constitute 99.90% and 99.53% of the volatile oil, respectively. In total, 26 compounds were identified in the EO of 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic>, whereas 37 compounds were found in the EO isolated from 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic>. The analysis showed that the most monoterpene hydrocarbons and oxygenated monoterpenes were the main groups of chemicals in both EOs.
