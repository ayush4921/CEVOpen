<p>Considering their combinatory activity, EO of 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> in combination with 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> EO produced an additive antimicrobial effect against all 12 strains tested. The combination profiles of four 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains are presented graphically in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00393-f001">Figure 1</xref>. The isobole curves clearly show the additive effect against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains tested, whereas the additive interactions can be read according to the curves indicating the borderline of additivity and synergy. In several cases (i.e., for one combination of these volatile agents in the vapor phase and four combinations in broth), they showed ΣFICs lower than 0.6, which can be considered a strong additive interaction, reaching values close to the synergistic effect. The most effective concentrations inhibiting the growth of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (SA) were found in the liquid phase against methicillin-resistant clinical isolate SA 2 at 512 μg/mL of 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> EO and 32 μg/mL of 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> (ΣFIC = 0.53) and in the vapor phase against standard strain SA ATCC 29213 at 242 μg/mL of 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> EO and 128 μg/mL of 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> EO (ΣFIC = 0.59). On average, the best FIC values were observed in both the liquid and vapor phases when the concentrations of 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> EO were 256 and 128 μg/mL. Based on the results, the optimum ratio of 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> and 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> to achieve bacterial inhibition would be 0.5-2:1 in the vapor phase and 0.4-1.2:1 in the liquid phase.
