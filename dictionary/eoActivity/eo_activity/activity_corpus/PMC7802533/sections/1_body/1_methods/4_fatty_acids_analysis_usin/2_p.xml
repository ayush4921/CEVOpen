<p>Handal seed oil fatty acids were esterified to fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). A 300 μl of the seed oil was spiked with internal standard (30 μl of C18:0 alkane, 1 mg/ml in n‐hexane). Esterification process was performed using 500 μl of 1.5N methanolic‐HCl (Sigma‐Aldrich). Then, the content was vortexed and incubated (60°C) for 30 min. Following incubation, distilled water (0.8 ml) was added to the cooled samples, and the FAMEs extracted 3 times with 500 μl hexane. The combined fractions were dried under N
 <sub>2</sub> and resuspended in n‐hexane (300 μl).
