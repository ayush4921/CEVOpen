<p id="par0205">It has been reported in various studies that TQ demonstrates a key role in various pathogenic conditions of kidneys. TQ attenuates oxidative stress and inflammation by providing protection from various toxic agents (
 <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">Benhelima et al., 2016</xref>). It reduces gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity indexes and degenerative changes. TQ supplementation prevents acute renal failure induced by gentamicin by recovering mitochondrial function and enhancing the production of ATP. TQ during ifosfamide treatment improves the severity of ifosfamide-induced renal damage, phosphaturia, glucosuria, high serum creatinine level and urea and stabilise clearance rate of creatinine. Pyelonepheritis induced oxidative damage of the kidneys can be protected by TQ administration. Also the cisplatin antitumor action is potentiated by TQ as well as it protects against nephrotoxicity induced by cisplatin (
