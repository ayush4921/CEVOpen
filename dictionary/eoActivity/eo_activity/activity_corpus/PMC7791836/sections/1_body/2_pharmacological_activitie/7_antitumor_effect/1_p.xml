<p id="Par72">Several recent studies provided results that elucidated patchouli-mediated antitumor activity; the underlying mechanisms have been revealed to some extent. Recent results revealed that an aqueous extract of patchouli could overcome the resistance of endometrial cancer cells to paclitaxel and could likewise promote growth inhibition [

PA also exhibited antitumor effect when targeting cells of the human lung cancer A549 line both in vitro and in vivo by activating both caspase 9 and caspase 3 and modulating mitochondria-mediated apoptosis; the underlying molecular mechanism involves inhibited phosphorylation of EGFR and the phosphorylation of targets within the JNK signaling pathway [

The administration of PA can also inhibit the proliferation of human leukemia MV4-11 cells and thereby induce their apoptosis; the mechanisms underlying this response may be related to a decrease in NF-ÎºB and phospho-pyruvate kinase M2 (p-PKM2), and the increase of Caspase-3 protein expression [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] revealed that pogostone could inhibit the proliferation and the colony formation of gallbladder carcinoma SGC-996 cells by its capacity to promote the expression of caspase-9, caspase-3, and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase-1 (PARP-1), to increase the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, and to decrease the expression of cyclin D1, cyclin A, and cyclin B. Taken together, these findings suggest that the antitumor effect of pogostone may be related to the regulation of apoptosis- and cell cycle-regulated proteins.
