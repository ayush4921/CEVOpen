 <italic>Pogostemon cablin</italic> Benth., also known as patchouli, or “Guanghuoxiang” in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), is a member of the Lamiaceae family of flowering plants and has been used to treat colds, nausea, fever, headache, and diarrhea [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Guanghuoxiang is among the raw materials used in formulations of numerous famous Chinese patent medicines, including Huoxiang Zhengqi Koufuye (oral liquid) and Baoji Pian (tablets). Huoxiang Zhengqi Koufuye can be used to treat gastrointestinal diseases, while Baoji Pian is mainly used for common cold with summer-heat and dampness syndrome in TCM [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Previous research revealed that patchouli was composed of a variety of chemical substances, including monoterpenoids, triterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, phytosterols, flavonoids, organic acids, lignins, glycosides, alcohols, pyrone, and aldehydes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Given its multicomponent nature, patchouli has been found to promote numerous pharmacological activities, and has been shown to protect against inflammation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], microorganisms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], tumors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], aging [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and oxidation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Moreover, patchouli and its extracts exert remarkable beneficial effects that promote the healthy functioning of organs and tissues. Among these findings, patchouli extracts have been shown to protect against gastrointestinal infection with 
 <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and ulcers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]; they can also suppress adipogenesis and fat accumulation in adipocytes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], alleviate ischemia/reperfusion-induced brain injury [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and prevent atherosclerosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Based on previous review, it can be concluded that patchouli alcohol (PA), β-patchoulene (β-PAE), patchoulene epoxide (PAO), pogostone, and pachypodol are the material basis for patchouli to exert therapeutic effects. As a significant ingredient in patchouli, PA has been most intensively studied in the pharmacological effects including anti-inflammatory effect, anti-apoptotic effect, anti-oxidative effect, anti-tumor effect, and others. Recently, some new pharmacological effects of PA have been explored, a research in 2019 has illustrated that PA could suppress adipogenesis and fat accumulation in adipocytes to prevent obesity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Another study in the same year demonstrated that PA could exert analgesic effect by regulating opioid receptors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Furthermore, PA could exert an intensively vasorelaxant effect as a Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> antagonist [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In addition to PA, pogostone has been reported to possess gastroprotective, anti-photoaging, and antimicrobial properties. Furthermore, a research in 2017 found that pogostone exerted the antitumor activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and another study in 2019 revealed that pogostone could protect lung tissue via its role in regulating oxidative stress, which contributes to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Moreover, other bioactive ingredients such as β-PAE, PAO, and pachypodol have attracted much attention in recent years, and the researches on their pharmacological effects as well as mechanisms has been deepened gradually. The chemical structures of PA, β-PAE, PAO, pogostone, and pachypodol are shown in Fig.
