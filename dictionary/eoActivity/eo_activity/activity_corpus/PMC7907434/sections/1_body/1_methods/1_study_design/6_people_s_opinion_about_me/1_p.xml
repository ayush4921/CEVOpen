<p>This questionnaire consists of four statements. Patients were requested to answer using yes or no responses regarding their preferred source of information about these products (doctor, herbalist, nutritionist, family, fellow patient, books and magazines, television, and the internet). We also asked participants to add another source of information. Finally, we added an open question related to the individual's suggestions about plants or herbs used traditionally for psychotherapy.</p>
