<p>The attribution of causes of psychological disorder (ACPD) questionnaire was designed to assess the individual's attributions of cause and some possible remedies for psychological disorders. The APCD questionnaire included nine statements, which examined attributions reflecting (i) biological factors, (ii) psychosocial factors (work, study, or stressful events), (iii) environment factors, and (iv) supernatural factors (The evil eye, magic, astrology), which lead to mental distress, and the participants were also asked to add other possible causes that might lead to mental distress. These causal attribution dimensions were based on constructs in the studies of Al-Krenawi et al. (

Possible remedies for psychological disorders in the survey included six statements, which investigated the preferred treatment approach such as relying on personal resources for help, pharmacotherapy medication, psychological consulting, meditation, diet, medicinal and aromatic plants, religious activities, and practicing sports. In addition, the participant was given the opportunity to add other remedies for the psychological disorders. The items were rated on a 3-point scale (yes = 1, maybe = 2, no = 3).
