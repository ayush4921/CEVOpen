  <p>Functional annotation and GO classification of assembled unigenes in 
   <italic>C. camphora</italic>. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Functional annotation of assembled unigenes by BLASTx against Nr and Swissprot databases with an 
   <italic>E</italic>-value threshold of 1e
   <sup>â€“5</sup>. A total of 34,789 unigenes were commonly annotated in the two databases. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> GO terms of 
   <italic>C. camphora</italic> unigenes determined by Blast2GO fell into the three categories of biological process, cellular component, and molecular function, where metabolic process, cell part, and catalytic activity were the three most prevalent subcategories, respectively. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> KEGG classification of annotated unigenes. The 
   <italic>x-</italic>axis shows the number of unigenes annotated, and the 
   <italic>y</italic> axis shows the KEGG metabolic pathways the unigenes fell into, including organismal system (O), metabolism (M), genetic information processing (G), environmental information processing (E), and cellular processes (C).
