<p>Annotated protein-coding enzymes were mapped into the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathway, and gene expression data of each enzyme in the two experimental groups were indicated with logRPKM values (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS6">Supplementary Table S6</xref>). Two unigenes encoding key enzymes, 
 <italic>AACT-like</italic> in the MVA pathway and 
 <italic>DXS-like</italic> in the MEP pathway, exhibited a higher expression level in the groups with high oil contents. Because both MVA and MEP pathways generate the precursors IPP and DMAPP for the final production of terpenoids, increased expression of these two genes could explain the higher amount of terpenoids we observed in this group (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Additionally, the 
 <italic>GGPPS-like</italic> gene also had a higher expression level in the leaves of linalool type. Among the DEGs, 14 unigenes were annotated as terpenoid synthaseâ€“encoding genes, including four in monoterpenoid biosynthesis, four in sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis, and six in diterpenoid biosynthesis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS6">Supplementary Table S6</xref>). One 
 <italic>LIS-like</italic> and one 
 <italic>GerS-like</italic> unigene were up-regulated in the monoterpenoid biosynthesis pathway, indicating that increased availability of terpenoid precursors, along with increased levels of monoterpene synthases, might be the reason for the higher oil yield and higher accumulation of linalool and other monoterpenes in the trees of linalool type. Besides monoterpenoid synthases, four sesquiterpenoid synthase unigenes encoding GerD and four diterpenoid synthase unigenes encoding CLS, CYP88D6, GA2OX1, and GA2OX8 were also up-regulated. In general, the upregulation of terpenoid synthase unigenes in the trees of linalool-type 
 <italic>C. camphor</italic> is consistent with their increased accumulation of terpenoids, suggesting that the presence of various terpenoid synthases might be the reason for the occurrence of varied terpenoids in the essential oils of 
 <italic>C. camphora</italic>. To validate the reliability of our RNA-Seq data, four DEGs were chosen for qRT-PCR examination. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, the expression profiles of these unigenes observed by qRT-PCR are identical to their profiles identified in the RNA-Seq analysis.
