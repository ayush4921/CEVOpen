<p>Terpenoid biosynthesis and its regulation are extensively documented in many plant species. Despite having high structural diversity, all terpenes are derived from two isomeric basic backbone molecules, IPP and DMAPP, which are synthesized either through the MVA or MEP pathways (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Sacchettini and Poulter, 1997</xref>). Although many members of the Lauraceae family are rich in terpenoids and are economically important tree species, limited studies are available analyzing genes involved in its terpenoid biosynthesis pathway (

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). This study was focused on identifying genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis and key enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the backbone IPP and DMAPP molecules in 
 <italic>C. camphora</italic>. A transcriptome of 
 <italic>C. camphora</italic> was also generated to provide a reference for future RNA-Seq–based expression profiling of terpenoid biosynthesis. Functional annotation analysis showed significant enrichment in genes associated with “metabolic pathways” and “biosynthesis of secondary metabolites” (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). This is consistent with our observation that September–November is the time of the year when 
 <italic>C. camphora</italic> harbors the highest oil contents (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Qin et al., 2015</xref>), and it is also the harvesting time of our samples. Furthermore, 116 and 18 expressed unigenes were identified to be highly homologous with 49 and 11 known enzymes in the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis and monoterpenoid biosynthesis pathways, respectively.
