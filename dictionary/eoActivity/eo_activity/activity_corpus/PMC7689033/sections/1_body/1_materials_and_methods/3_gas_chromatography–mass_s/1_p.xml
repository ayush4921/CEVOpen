<p>Analyses of essential oils were performed on a gas chromatography system (Agilent 7890B, United States) equipped with a TG-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25-mm internal diameter × 0.25-μm film thickness). Helium with a flow rate of 1 mL/min was used as the carrier gas. The injector was maintained at 220°C. The initial temperature of the column was set at 40°C and increased to 280–300°C at a rate of 6.5°C/min. The mass spectrometer was set to scan in the range of 50–650 m/z with a scan rate of 0.5 scans/s. Compounds were determined based on their relative retention time and mas spectra data. Details were described in our previous study (
