<p>In the studies of 
 <italic>C. camphora</italic>, transcriptome analyses for leaves of camphor trees of linalool-, borneol-, camphor-, cineol-, and iso-nerolidol types led to the identification of 424 unigenes in the biosynthetic pathways of terpenoids (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>) and transcriptome profiling of linalool and borneol types of 
 <italic>C. camphora</italic> identified three monoterpene synthase genes possibly involved in the biosynthesis of borneol (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). Although these two transcriptome studies have provided valuable insights into the terpenoid biosynthesis pathway, comparisons between only high-oil-yielding individuals could exclude the identification of genes upstream of the biosynthetic pathway of terpenoids. In this study, we used RNA-Seq to identify key enzyme-encoding genes putatively associated with terpenoid biosynthesis in 
 <italic>C. camphora</italic>, which may partially determine its essential oil composition. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between camphor trees of linalool-type and low-oil-yield camphor trees were identified. In addition to four unigenes in the “monoterpenoid biosynthesis” pathway, this analysis also identified three unigenes in the “terpenoid backbone biosynthesis” pathway. Overall, these results contribute to the general understanding of terpenoid biosynthesis in 
 <italic>C. camphora</italic> and provide a theoretical basis for metabolic engineering of terpenoids in this species.
