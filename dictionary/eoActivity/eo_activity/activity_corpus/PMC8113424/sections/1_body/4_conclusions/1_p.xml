<p id="Par32">In the current research, a fast protocol was introduced for the transformation of 
 <italic>Trachyspermum ammi</italic>, using zygotic embryo explants within 25â€“35 days. The introduced protocol displayed the integration of 
 <italic>TPS2</italic> gene with transgenic plants and the transformation efficiency 19.29%. Finally, HPLC analysis confirmed the increase of thymol in the aerial part of 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> due to expression of 
 <italic>TPS2</italic> gene (one copy number). Overall, this study could be a practical protocol to enhance significant constituents in this plant; therefore, it can be beneficial for biotechnological research studies and pharmaceutical uses.
