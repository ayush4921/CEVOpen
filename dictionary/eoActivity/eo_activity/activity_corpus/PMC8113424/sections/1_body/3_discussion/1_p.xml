<p id="Par28">Numerous plants have potential medicinal uses and mainly contain valuable secondary metabolites representing anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties. The growing demand for these plant secondary metabolites suggests the use of biotechnology tools to produce transgenic plants in vitro. These methods have yielded valuable results and revealing that the production of transgenic plants is efficient and cost-effective to produce valuable secondary metabolite resources for medicine and industry [
