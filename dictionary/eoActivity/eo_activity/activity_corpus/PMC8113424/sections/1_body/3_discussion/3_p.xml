<p id="Par30">One of the most important ways to produce valuable plant secondary metabolites is to manipulate plant metabolic pathways by overexpressing or silencing selected elements in their biosynthesis pathway [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Metabolic pathway manipulation is performed to increase the content of secondary metabolites (terpenoids) in the cultivation of many laboratory plants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. The results of this study showed that 
 <italic>the T. ammi</italic> is transformed with both strains of 
 <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> (transformation efficacy: EHA101 (19.29%), LBA4404 (10.52%). Hoseini et al. studied the transformation of 
 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> by the as part insulin gene and two 
 <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> strains (EHA101 and GV 3101). They found that the EHA101 strain of 
 <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> was more efficient than the GV3101 strain in gene transformation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Pandey et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] used two strains LBA4404 and EHA101 for the transformation of 
 <italic>Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal</italic>. They demonstrated that LBA4404 had more 
 <italic>gusA</italic> expression compared to EHA101. In our study, DNA hybridization was utilized for further verification of the combination of the 
 <italic>TPS2</italic> gene into the plant genome. We found that the different dimensions of hybridization signals are caused by the stable T-DNA combination with the genome rather than endophytic 
 <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> pollution. Moreover, according to HPLC analysis, a transgene copy can have a high potential for increasing gene expression in the transgenic 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic>. Ma et al. found one to three copies of DNA hybridization fragments in transformed 
 <italic>Veratrum dahuricum</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Dai et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] reported that transgenic plants with more copy numbers of transgene showed lower level of 
 <italic>GUS</italic> gene activity. It could be due to gene silencing mechanism. However, Alvarez [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] reported that copy number has no effect on foreign gene expression.
