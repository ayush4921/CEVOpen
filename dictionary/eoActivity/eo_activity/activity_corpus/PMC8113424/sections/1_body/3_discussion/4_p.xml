<p id="Par31">The production of high-capacity transgenic plants to produce valuable plant compounds creates a new field for discovering natural molecules, derived from both plants or plant-microbial interactions, for medical and other valuable purposes [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] showed that the transformation of 
 <italic>Ttrachyspermm ammi</italic> by 
 <italic>Agrobacterium rhizogenes</italic> strains (A4, LBA 9402, ATCC 15834) and seedling stem can increase thymol content (11.30 mg/g DM). This study demonstrated 5.3-fold enhancement of biomass and thymol agglomeration. In another study, to enhance drought and salinity tolerance in 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic>, betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase gene and hypocotyl explants were used. The results showed enhancement thymol level in both wild type and transformed plants of ajowan (39.2 and 55.07%) by the drought stress [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. In another study conducted by Sharma et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], it was found that overexpression of Tryptophan decarboxylase and strictosidine synthase in 
 <italic>Catharanthus roseus</italic> increased vindoline, catharanthine, and vinblastine content.
