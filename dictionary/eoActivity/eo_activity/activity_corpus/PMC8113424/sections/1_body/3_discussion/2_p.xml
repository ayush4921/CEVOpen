<p id="Par29">Tissue culture methods are greatly applied to conserve and reproduce the medicinal plants that are laborious and time-consuming to propagate by conventional methods. Zygotic embryos are appropriate explants to regenerate plants because these explants, with convenient culture media, can produce many plants in the least time and with great proficiency. Different combinations of auxins and cytokinins were applied to regenerate
