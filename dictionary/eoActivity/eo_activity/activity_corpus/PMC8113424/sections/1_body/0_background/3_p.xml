<p id="Par13">Terpenoids are one of the most diverse classes of natural products. Based on 
 <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated genetic evolution, several plant metabolic engineering strategies are promising to regulate the biosynthesis of medicinal terpenoids such as overexpression of terpenoid biosynthesis pathway genes in plants and suppression expression of competitive metabolic pathways [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. During the recent years, using overexpression, several monoterpene and sesquiterpene synthases have been changed to generate new monoterpenes, and sesquiterpenes that were present in floral and green tissues [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Moreover, much attention has been lately paid to the synthesis pathways of terpenes. Most terpenes in herbs are involved in producing secondary metabolites [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. TPS2 is one of the most important synthesizing enzymes of monoterpenes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Previous studies on 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> have demonstrated that γ-terpinene is a major precursor in the aromatic monoterpene pathway leading to production of p-cymene, thymol, and carvacrol by the terpene synthase 2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, nowadays, production of the most secondary metabolites is possible through manipulation of synthesis pathways in medicinal plants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Thymol is a valuable and the main essential oil existing in 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Many of the therapeutic properties of this plant are relevant to thymol [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In brief, transgenic plants’ procedure consists of transferring the selected gene into an extremely totipotent explant using 
 <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> strains and development of regenerated plants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. On the other hand, optimization of gene transfer process plays an important role in the success of plant transformation. The transformation of the 
 <italic>GUS</italic> gene along with 
 <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> has been carried out in some medicinal plants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].
