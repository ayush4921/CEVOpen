The success of the embryo propagation technique depends on isolating the embryo and determining the appropriate culture media and growth regulators. Auxin and cytokinin growth regulators have a significant role in growth quality in embryos. In the former research works, the efficacy of auxins and cytokinins in regeneration of several medicinal plants has been studied [

Biotechnology by techniques, such as cell and tissue culture, genetic engineering, molecular markers, metabolic engineering, and gene overexpression have proven to be able to enhance the effectiveness of medicinal plants as a renewable resource for drug production [
