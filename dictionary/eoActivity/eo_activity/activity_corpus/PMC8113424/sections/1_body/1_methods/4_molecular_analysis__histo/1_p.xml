<p id="Par21">In the present research, total genomic DNA of the plant was extracted from leaves of the transformed and non-transformed herbs to be used for PCR and subsequently verify the presence of genes in transgenic herbs (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The PCR status was identified as follows: initial denaturation for 5 min at 94°C, then 35 subsequent cycles of denaturation runs for 1 min at 94°C, annealing at 60°C (
 <italic>GUS</italic>), 61°C (
 <italic>TPS2</italic>), and 62°C (
 <italic>nptII</italic>) genes for 1 min then extension at 72°C for 45 s and the last extension at 72°C for 5 min. 
 <italic>GUS</italic> expression was also determined for randomly selected transformed plants. The histochemical 
 <italic>GUS</italic> test was performed based on Jefferson instruction [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Small samples were isolated from leaves of the transformed and non-transformed plants and immersed in 1.5-ml tubes. Then, X-gluc (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-glucuronidase) buffer was added into the tubes and kept at a temperature of 37°C (room temperature) for 24 h. Afterward, the solution was taken out of the tube and the plants immersed in 70% ethanol for 4 h. Finally, the samples were observed under a binocular stereomicroscope.
