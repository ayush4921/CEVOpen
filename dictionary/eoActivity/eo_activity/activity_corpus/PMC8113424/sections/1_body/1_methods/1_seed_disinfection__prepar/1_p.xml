<p id="Par15">The mature seeds of 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> (ecotype of Shaheideh Yazd) were provided from the Research Institute of Forests and Rangelands of Iran. For seed disinfection, they were first submerged in 70% ethyl alcohol and Tween-20 for 60 s. Next, they were disinfected with 1.5% sodium hypochlorite (SH) (w/v) for 3 min by gentle agitation. Then, sterilized seeds were rinsed at least three times with sterile double-distilled water (each for time lasting 5 min). Afterwards, the seeds were dried on a sterile paper and were located in 50 ml conical tubes containing autoclaved water for 24 h in a growth chamber at 25±2°C under 16/8 h (light/darkness) photoperiod. After 24 h, the seeds were placed on a filter paper for 3 min in a sterile situation. Afterwards, embryos were separated from swollen seeds and used as explants. Isolated embryos were cultured on MS [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] media supplemented with different concentrations of NAA, BA, 2,4-D, KIN, 3% (w/v) sucrose, and 0.7% (w/v) agar. Before autoclaving (121°C, 1.04 kg cm
 <sup>2</sup>, 20 min) of media, pH was adjusted to 5.7–5.8. The Petri dishes were incubated in the growth chamber at 25±2°C with the light intensity of about 2000 Lux provided by white fluorescent lamps and photoperiod of 16/8 h. Furthermore, to assess the effect of growth regulators on zygotic embryo propagation, different of various concentrations of NAA (0.5, 1, 2), BA (0, 0.5, 1), 2,4-D (0.5, 1, 2), and KIN (0.2, 0.5, 1) on B5 (salts + vitamins) or MS (salts + vitamins) media were applied (Table
