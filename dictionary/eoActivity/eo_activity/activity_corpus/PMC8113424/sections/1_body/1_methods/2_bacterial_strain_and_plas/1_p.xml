<p id="Par19">The transgenic 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> was prepared using hypocotyl explants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], but this method produces a small number of plants and is time-consuming. So, another procedure was used to produce more transgenic plants in a shortest period of time. We also used 
 <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> EHA101 and LBA4404 with the genetic construct of pBI121-TPS2 as well as zygotic embryos. This vector contains the 
 <italic>TPS</italic> and 
 <italic>neomycin phosphotransferase (nptII)</italic> gene, as a selectable marker. To optimize transformation factors, a strain of 
 <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> harboring the binary vector pBI121 possessing the 
 <italic>GUS</italic> gene was also used.
