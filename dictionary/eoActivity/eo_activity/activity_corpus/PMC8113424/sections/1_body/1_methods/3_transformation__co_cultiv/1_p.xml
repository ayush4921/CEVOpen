<p id="Par20">To determine the appropriate level of kanamycin for gene transfer, zygotic embryos were isolated (as explained in the previous section) and placed on the media (best chosen media based on tissue culture) with diverse levels of kanamycin (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 50, and 75 mg/l). Kanamycin was added following the preparation of autoclaved selective medium and after cooling (40–50°C) in a laminar flow hood. In the transformation step, a single 
 <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> colony grown on LB solid medium with kanamycin (50 mg/l) was cultured for 48 h and then transferred to the conical tube containing LB liquid with suitable antibiotics and incubated overnight in an incubator at 28°C on a rotary shaker (OD600 = 0.4–0.6). Additionally, in transformation processing, two vectors, pBI121-TPS and pBI121, were used. In the laminar hood, the embryos were separated from seeds (described previous) and immersed in bacterial suspension in 15-ml conical tubes several times (30 s, 1 min, 2 min, 3 min, and 5 min) with gentle shaking. Then, they were put on sterile paper to get dried after inoculation. In the next step, the explants were placed on co-cultivation medium (best chosen media with antibiotics) at diverse times (1 and 2 days). Finally, they were cultured on callus induction medium adding 15 mg/l kanamycin and 180 mg/l cefotaxime to inhibit 
 <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> strains’ growth and were placed in a growth chamber.
