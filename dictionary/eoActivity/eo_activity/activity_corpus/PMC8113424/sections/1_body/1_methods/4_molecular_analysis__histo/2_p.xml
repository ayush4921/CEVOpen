<p id="Par22">The total RNA from leaves of transformed plants was extracted using trizol (Invitrogen, USA) for final verification of the transformed plants and stable expression of 
 <italic>GUS</italic> gene. After treatment with DNase, the first cDNA strand was produced by a cDNA synthesis kit (Eurex) and Oligo-dT primer. Finally, two strands of cDNA were synthesized in a thermal cycler (Bio-Rad) by specific primers.
