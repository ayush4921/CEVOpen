<p id="Par25">Callus induction and regeneration of 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> were acquired in all tested treatments (zygotic embryos and different concentrations of plant growth regulators) on MS and B5 media. The B5 medium indicated abundant callus induction from days 8 to 10. The B5 media supplemented with 0.5 mg/l BA and 1 mg/l NAA were also observed to be the foremost treatment for callus induction. The MS media supplemented with 1 mg/l 2,4-D, and 0.2 mg/l KIN also demonstrated high callus induction (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Moreover, plant regeneration on B5 and MS media demonstrated a good rate with all treatments so that the range of regeneration changed from 41.1 to 92.6% (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Fresh and dry weights of calli also varied from 0.27 to 0.53 mg and from 0.018 to 0.034 mg, respectively. Furthermore, the height of the regenerated shoots was varied from 5.53 to 10.23 cm (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). A comparison made between the treatments demonstrated that the highest percentage of regeneration for this ecotype (Shaheideh Yazd) was obtained in B5 medium with 0.5 mg/l BA together with 1 mg/l NAA. We only used this medium in plant transformation since this medium showed the best regeneration in tissue culture. Callus induction, regeneration, and growth of zygotic embryo have been shown in Fig.
