<p id="Par27">Meanwhile, a PCR amplification of 465 bp 
 <italic>TPS2</italic> gene was proved in putative transgenic herbs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). Following, the PCR was accomplished by specific primers of 
 <italic>nptII</italic> and was verified with the presentation of 470 bp fragment on an agarose gel (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). PCR was also accomplished with 
 <italic>VIR G</italic> primer to confirm lack of bacterial contamination. As a positive control, 
 <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> indicated a fragment of 850 bp (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). Based on the outcomes of PCR, transformed herbs showed the transformation efficiency of 19.29% (EHA101) and 10.52% (LBA4404) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>e). Moreover, six putative transgenic plants approved by repeated PCR analysis were analyzed via DNA hybridization to indicate the additional combination of the 
 <italic>TPS2</italic> gene into the genome of transgenic herbs. Different models were observed for hybridizing in 4 out of 6 putative transgenic herbs. The results revealed one insert (two lanes 1 and 2) and more than one fragment (two lanes 5 and 6). No band was found in the non-transformed herb (lane NT) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). Outcomes of HPLC of 
 <italic>Trachyspermum ammi</italic> also indicated the highest thymol level in the transformed herbs. The thymol level was 143.90 mg/g, in the dried extract of transformed herbs (one copy number), 54.40 mg/g in the dried extract of transformed herbs (two copy number) and it was 21.09 mg/g in the dried extract of non-transformed herbs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). These results showed 7-fold increment in thymol content (one copy number) and 2.5-fold increment (two copy number) than the non-transgenic plant. Several steps of regenerating the putative transgenic herbs are shown in Fig.
