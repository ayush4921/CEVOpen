<p id="Par26">By studying the effect of kanamycin on the embryo culture, we noticed that calluses appeared in 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 mg/l kanamycin but their initiation and growth were delayed by increasing kanamycin levels. Additionally, for higher concentrations of kanamycin, no callus induction was observed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). Kanamycin concentrations (0, 5, and 10 mg/l) showed plant regeneration, and there was no regeneration at high concentrations of kanamycin (15, 20, 25, 30, 50, and 75 mg/l) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d). So, 15 mg/l concentration was applied as a threshold level of kanamycin for choosing the putative transgenic herbs. Findings the inoculation and co-cultivation time of LBA4404 harboring pBI121 with 
 <italic>GUS</italic> gene also illustrated that 30 s inoculation along with 1-day co-cultivation had the most callus induction (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). Results of inoculation and co-cultivation time for regeneration showed that 30 s inoculation with 1-day co-cultivation had the most regeneration. These conditions were showed to be also appropriate for gene transferring process (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). Further, the existence of the 
 <italic>GUS</italic> gene was confirmed with the presence of 450 bp fragments in 2% agarose gel. As it is observed in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b, no PCR segment has been amplified in the non-transformed and the control sample (deionized water). The 470 bp segment has been amplified using the 
 <italic>nptII</italic> specific primers (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). Also, to demonstrate the nonexistence of bacterial pollution, 
 <italic>VIR G</italic>-specific primer was utilized. The fragments of 850 bp were obtained as a positive control using 
 <italic>VIR G</italic> primer, and there was no any fragment for transformed plants on an agarose gel, confirming the nonexistence of 
 <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> contamination in transformed plants (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). Results of histochemical 
 <italic>GUS</italic> analysis, on the other hand, verified the existence of the blue color in transformed and no color in the non-transformed herbs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). To approve the final expression of 
 <italic>GUS</italic> in a transgenic plant, we carried out RT-PCR by 
 <italic>GUS</italic>-specific primer. No bond existed in the control herb (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). Based on these results, the integrating the T-DNA harboring the 
 <italic>GUS</italic> gene into the plant genome was verified. Hence, on the basis of the confirmation of gene existence in the plants and regenerating plants in the kanamycin culture medium, we can conclude that the regenerated plant is transgenic.
