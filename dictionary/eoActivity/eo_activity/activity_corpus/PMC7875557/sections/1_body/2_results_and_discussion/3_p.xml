<p>Selection of proper lipidic excipients remain the key challenge to successful formulation design, which also influences the bioavailability of the poorly soluble drugs along with the safety issues and costs. The formulation development process included the selection of the suitable excipients, such as bioactive/polar oils for SN and DN as combined dosage form in considering therapeutic value. In the current studies, it was clearly shown that the selection of a suitable bioactive excipient in SNEDDS could have the potential performance in enhancing the oral bioavailability and therapeutic effect of the model drugs, SN and DN, for diabetic patients.</p>
