<p>Given the multiple pathophysiological lesions in type 2 diabetes, combination therapy remains a logical approach to control the disease management. The combined use of SN and DN in oral dose could be an effective treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus, consistent with the complementary mechanisms of action by which these two agents improve glucose control (Jabbour etÂ al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The expected achievements of the dosage form would be strongly correlated to the medical and health care area, particularly within the pharmacy and pharmaceutical sciences. These achievements could improve the quality of medication delivered to the diabetic patient. In addition, the improvement of loading capacity of two anti-diabetic drugs in single SNEDDS formulation, thus, is to reduce the dose frequency and pill burdens. In the current study, SNEDDS (contained thymoquinone from BSO) were successfully developed for the combined dosage form design, which included: (a) the role of lipid excipients in formulation design and development techniques, (b) maintaining both model drugs in solubilized state which provided the rationale for avoiding drug precipitation tendency from the lipid formulation systems through the gastro intestinal tract, and (c) the bioavailability of the SNEDDS using male Wister rats for the model drug.
