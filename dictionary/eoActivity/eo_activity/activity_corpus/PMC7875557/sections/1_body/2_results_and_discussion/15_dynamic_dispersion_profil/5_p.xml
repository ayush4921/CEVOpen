<p>The lack of available data to describe the relationship between formulation and performance 
 <italic>inÂ vivo</italic> has been a disadvantage to the formulation of lipid-based delivery systems. SNEDDS that disperse quickly giving an ultrafine nanoemulsion/microemulsion are transparent with a transparent/bluish appearance. However, a more important characteristic of the nanoemulsion is the ability of the formulation to maintain the drug in solution through transit within the gastrointestinal tract. To achieve this, the drug must be kept in solubilized state during dispersion, which typically occurs in the stomach, as well as during stomach digestion and subsequently digestion in the small intestine. As such, we focused on the dispersion phase in the stomach and examine how the excipients used in the SNEDDS formulation influences the rate of precipitation.
