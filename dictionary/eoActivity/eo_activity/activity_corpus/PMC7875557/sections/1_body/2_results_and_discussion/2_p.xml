<p>The SNEDDS formulation in this study was developed using therapeutically active excipients (i.e. black seed oil). The BSO, containing thymoquinone as the active phytochemical (2-isopropyl-5-methylbenzo-1, 4-quinone) shows antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects used to design representative SNEDDS in combined dosage form. It has been commonly used for more than 2000 years as a traditional remedy to treat a variety of health conditions (Goreja, 
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Thymoquinone is the most hydrophobic bioactive molecule (549 to 740 µg/mL in aqueous solutions), thus if loaded externally into formulations, it could poses solubility challenges (Ali &amp; Blunden, 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Salem, 
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Salmani et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) for systemic absorption. The current studies minimizes this solubility challenges of thymoquinone as it is inert in the SNEDDS in addition to its synergistic effects in lowering glucose level inhibition and increasing antioxidant activities.
