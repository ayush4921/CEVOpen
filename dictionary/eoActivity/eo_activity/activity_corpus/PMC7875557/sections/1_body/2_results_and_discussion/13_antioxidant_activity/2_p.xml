<p>The antioxidant activity assay showed that the representative SNEDDS (F1: BSO/CMCM/CrEL [15/35/50] %w/w) possess moderate antioxidant activity in both methods (DPPH scavenging and 
 <italic>Î²</italic>-carotene bleaching assay) when they are compared with the standards (Ascorbic acid and Rutin). The result from the study shown in 
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> suggested that thymoquinone is the main constituent of the BSO (
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seeds), which was reported to have antioxidant activity. It has retained its antioxidant activity when formulated with model drugs, SN and DN, in the current study.
