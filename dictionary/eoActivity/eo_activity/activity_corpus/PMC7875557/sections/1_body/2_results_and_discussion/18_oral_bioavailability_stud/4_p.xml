<p>Findings reported from the antidiabetic studies here support that DN and SN in a combined dosage form showed better efficacy and improved outcomes in reducing blood glucose level. We however investigated only DN for its 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> pharmacokinetic studies. The reason was to correlate the enhancement of solubility and percentage of solubilized drug with the enhancement of its bioavailability, which was essential for the product performance. This would construct a proper 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> correlation for the drug of similar nature (Kazi et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). The bioavailability enhancement of DN may be due to the increased solubility and faster uptake of the nanoemulsion resulting from SNEDDS formulation by enterocytes at the absorption site. These findings from DN were agreed in accordance with several previous reports and expected to be the same for SN (Zhang et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Kazi et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>).
