<p>The PDI is dimensionless and scaled in a way that values smaller than 0.05 are considered to be highly monodispersed. Values greater than 0.7 indicate that the sample has a very broad size distribution and is probably yield large droplet sizes in the DLS technique. The small values of PDI shown by F1 and F3 SNEDDS formulation (0.140 and 0.046) indicated a homogenous droplet population and narrow globule size distribution as shown in
