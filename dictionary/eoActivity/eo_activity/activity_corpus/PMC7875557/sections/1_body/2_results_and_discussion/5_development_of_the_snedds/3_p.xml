<p>Regarding the self-emulsifying efficiency, a visual assessment study is very common and a prerequisite, which could minimize the excess usage of chemicals due to the trial and errors (Kommuru etÂ al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Therefore, miscibility of the oil/surfactant mixture in terms of hydrophilic lipophilic balance (HLB), homogeneity and appearance upon aqueous dilution were considered as visual assessment tools. The HLB values of the oils and surfactants can give a good indication of whether the two lipid excipients are miscible and should be used in the formulation or not. Within the scope of the current study, formulations that were homogeneous with clear/bluish appearance were considered to be efficient. 
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> depicts the efficiency evaluation results. Although the excipients miscibility was promising in all four formulations, the appearance upon aqueous dilution were different along with emulsification times. Formulation F1, F3, and F4 were produced transparent appearance and considered to be the efficient SNEDDS based on their appearances. These formulations were tagged as grade A SNEDDS in the current studies.
