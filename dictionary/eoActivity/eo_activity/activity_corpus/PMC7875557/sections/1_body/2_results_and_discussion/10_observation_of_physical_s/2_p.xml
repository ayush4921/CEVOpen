<p>Appearance of the dispersant (F1 and F3) showing the stability of the formulation after aqueous dispersion at initial dispersion time and after 3 months. F1 showed slight opaque color after 3 months without leading any sedimentation precipitation of SN and DN in anhydrous formulations. The anhydrous F1, F3 SNEDDS were kept for 3 months at room temperature for stability studies and, then, characterized in terms of their visual clarity, droplet size changes, and zeta potential values.</p>
