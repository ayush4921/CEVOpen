<p>The purpose of the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> lipolysis study was to see if any precipitation occurred during the lipolysis test period of 30 min. The results in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0007">Figure 7</xref> showed that the concentrations of SN and DN were found approximately 85% at 5 min, which suggested incomplete release of the drugs in the digests. However, the 100% drug release was achieved after completion of the lipolysis reaction for 30 min in presence of pancreatic lipase/co-lipase. There was not any precipitation recorded for both SN and DN which was supported by the above dynamic dispersion results in the current studies. However, it has been reported by Thomas et al. that 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> lipolysis data does not predict adequately the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> performance of a self-nanoemulsifying lipid-based drug delivery systems (SNEDDS; Thomas et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Furthermore, SNEDDS formulation are very flexible to produce diverse dosage forms such as liquid palatable solution, and conversion into solid dosage forms (self-emulsifying tablets, multiparticulate beads, and pellets etc.). Therefore, liquid SNEDDS have been remained as extensively demanding and effective alternatives to conventional emulsion or tablets.
