<p>Zeta potential is the charge that develops at the interface between a solid surface and its liquid medium. If the dispersed particles of aqueous media have high positive or negative zeta potential values, then they will repel each other to create dispersion stability. On the other hand, substantially low zeta potential values of the dispersant cannot force to prevent the particles coming together and therefore become unstable. Particles with zeta potential values of –16.10 ± 4.77 mV and –22.56 ± 5.12 mV for F1 and F3, respectively are considered stable. The zeta potential values of other SNEDDS were in the range of – (13.00–15.00) mV as shown in 
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. It was reported that the concentration of cremophor EL could have steric stabilization capacity of the SNEDDS system by forming a coat around their surface (Mohsin &amp; Pouton, 
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Usually, the nonionic surfactants do not contribute any charges to the nanoemulsion particles rather stabilizing the systems and this indicated that negatively charged particles contribute to the stability of formed nanoemulsion. The measured value for zeta potential is more than 15 mV which indicates good electrical properties for the preparer SNEDDS.
