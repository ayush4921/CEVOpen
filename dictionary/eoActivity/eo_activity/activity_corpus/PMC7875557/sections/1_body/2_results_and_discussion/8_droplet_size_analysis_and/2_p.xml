<p>As stated earlier, the self-emulsifying efficiency is strongly associated with the mean droplet size of the produced emulsion and on their stability. The droplet size analysis of the SNEDDS formulation showed lower particle sizes distribution upon aqueous dilution. The formulation F1 and F3 formed ultrafine dispersion with particle size of 66.57 ± 5.33 nm and 56.94 ± 3.87 nm and the systems were found to be a stable upon aqueous dilution, respectively (
