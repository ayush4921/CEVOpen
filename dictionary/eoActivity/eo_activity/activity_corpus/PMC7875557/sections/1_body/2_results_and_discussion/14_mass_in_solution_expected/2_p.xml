<p>In our previous studies, it was found that the determination of the equilibrium solubility of drug in the diluted formulation can be a useful tool of anticipating real-time drug precipitation. Hence, this experiment was conducted to investigate drug precipitation or on the other hand drug solubilization capacity after dilution of lipid formulations. The results in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5</xref> showed that all the diluted SNEDDS (F1, F2, F3, and F4) have significantly higher SN solubility compared to DN. However, among all the SNEDDS, F1-SN and F3-SN (99% diluted formulation) have high aqueous solubility (
