<p>The results from the anti-diabetic studies showed that after 2 h of dose intake, the blood glucose level was significantly reduced with the combined dose of SN and DN using F1-SNEDDS (63.97%) compared to SN alone (54.54%), DN alone (39.50%;

 <xref rid="t0006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref> showed the levels of glucose inhibition in serum in each group. It was reported that BSO (thymoquinone) containing optimized F1-SNEDDS resulted in reduced fasting glucose, decreased insulin resistance, increased beta-cell function, and reduced glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in human subjects (Abdelrazek et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Compared with SN or DN monotherapy and marketed product, DN plus SN loaded SNEDDS showed better anti-diabetic efficacy in the diabetic mice. The overall studies suggest that the combination therapy of SN, DN with thymoquinone (an additional therapeutic compound included from BSO) had considerable effect in lowering glucose, as such it may also be associated with improved beta-cell function and enhanced insulin clearance in addition to their established underlying mechanisms of action.
