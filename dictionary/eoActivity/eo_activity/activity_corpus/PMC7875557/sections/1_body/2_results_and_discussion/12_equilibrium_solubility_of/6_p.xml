<p>The main purpose of the solubility measurement was to increase the loading capacity of two anti-diabetic drugs in single SNEDDS formulation, thus, to reduce the dose frequency and improve the oral bioavailability. 
 <xref rid="t0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> shows the SN and DN solubility performance with 1 g SNEDDS formulation having capacity to dissolve 11.14 mg and 55.07 mg SN and DN, respectively. The higher solubility of SN and DN in SNEDDS formulation suggests that the mixture of glycerides (blend of mono-glycerides and di-glycerides- BSO: CMCM), along with hydrophilic surfactant, cremophor EL (polyoxyl 35-hydrogenated castor oil).
