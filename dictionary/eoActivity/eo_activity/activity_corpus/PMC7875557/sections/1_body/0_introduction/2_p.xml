<p>Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease that is characterized with increasing blood glucose levels over time. The disease is a major cause of blindness, heart attacks, stroke, kidney failure, and lower limb amputation in patients (Al Dawish et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Most of the type 2 diabetic patients require multiple therapies in order to control their blood sugar levels effectively and maintain glycemia at or below the A1c target of less than 7% (Al-Faris et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Although there have been several studies performed to evaluate the effectiveness of combined oral therapy to improve glycemic control, there is no large-scale definitive study on which of these are the best successive combinations to use. Therefore, emphasis should be given to the new combination therapies of anti-diabetic drugs, which must keep the A1c from rising much above the target range (Charpentier,
