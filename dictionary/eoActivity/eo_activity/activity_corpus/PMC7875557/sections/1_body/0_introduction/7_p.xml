<p>SGLT2 inhibitors such as DN and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors like SN is potentially beneficial in achieving glycemic control without the risk of hypoglycemia or weight gain treatment of type 2 diabetes (Santos et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). A recent study suggests that in patients with type 2 diabetes, combination therapy (Ji et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) provided additional clinical benefit and is well tolerated. Reductions in HbA1c and body weight with DN were observed in patients receiving SN either alone or in combination with metformin (Gallwitz,

 <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).
