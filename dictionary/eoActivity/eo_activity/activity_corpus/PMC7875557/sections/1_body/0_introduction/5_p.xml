<p>Sitagliptin (SN), an orally active, potent dipeptidyl-peptidase inhibitor [DPP-4 inhibitor (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1(A)</xref>) has recently been approved (listed in top 20 drugs in 2017) for the therapy of type 2 diabetes (Zerilli &amp; Pyon, 
 <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Like other DPP-4 inhibitors, its mechanism of action is by increasing glucagon-like peptide-1 incretin hormones and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (Miller etÂ al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). SN is effective in lowering HbA1c, and glucose (during fasting as well as postprandial) in monotherapy and in combination with other oral anti-diabetic agents (Plosker, 
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Dey, 
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). It stimulates insulin secretion when hyperglycemia is present and inhibits glucagon secretion (Scheen &amp; Van Gaal,
