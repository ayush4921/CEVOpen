<p>The representative SNEDDS formulated in the current studies provide collective advantages such as superior self-emulsification efficiency with improved physical stability and antioxidant activity, high drug loading capacity, high glucose inhibition level, and elevated DN bioavailability. The most appropriate excipientâ€™s concentrations that able to produce representative SNEDDS system were BSO (contains phytochemical thymoquinone) 15%, Capmul MCM 35%, and Cremophor EL 50%, respectively. The overall results suggest that the proposed SN-DN loaded F1-SNEDDS, which improve glucose control with an extra benefit from thymoquinone could be delivered as the potential combined dosage form encapsulated into hard and or soft gelatin capsules for the effective treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.</p>
