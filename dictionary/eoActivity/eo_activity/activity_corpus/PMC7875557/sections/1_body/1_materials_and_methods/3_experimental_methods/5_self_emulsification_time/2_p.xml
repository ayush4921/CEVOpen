<p>To determine the self-emulsification time, each formulation (100 mg) was dropped into 10 mL of milliQ water maintained at room temperature (22 °C) in a glass beaker. The diluted samples were mixed gently using a star shaped magnetic stirrer (Metrohm
 <sup>®</sup>, Switzerland) rotating at constant speed (600 rpm). The time needed for an anhydrous formulation to form a homogeneous mixture upon dilution was recorded by manual stirring option from the software. The emulsification time was determined until the final appearance of the nanoemulsion was observed (Nasr et al.,
