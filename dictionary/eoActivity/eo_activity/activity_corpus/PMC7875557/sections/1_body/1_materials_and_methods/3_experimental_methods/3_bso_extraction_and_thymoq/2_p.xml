<p>BSO (dark yellow in color), which was extracted from 
 <italic>Nigella sativa</italic> seed, was collected from the Southwest part of Bangladesh in early summer of 2019. Approximately 500 g of the collected seeds were washed in fresh water, well dried under sunlight, and carried for oil extraction using cold pressed technique and preserved in a screw-capped amber colored glass bottle till further use. The main bioactive component of the BSO is thymoquinone which is chemically known as 2-isopropyl-5-methylbenzo-1, 4-quinone. The amount of thymoquinone was estimated by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) analysis mentioned in our previous studies (Kazi et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The amount of thymoquinone in BSO was obtained as 20–50% which was in accordance with those reported in literature (Kazi et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Alwadei et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>).
