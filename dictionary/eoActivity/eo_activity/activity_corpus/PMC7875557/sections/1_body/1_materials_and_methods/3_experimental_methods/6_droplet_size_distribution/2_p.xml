<p>The droplet size distribution of diluted SNEDDS was measured by laser diffraction analysis using Zetasizer (NanoZS, Germany) particle sizing systems (Agarwal et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Prior to measurement, the anhydrous SNEDDS were diluted with milliQ water at a ratio of 1:1000 
 <italic>v/v</italic> and well-mixed for 1 min. Samples were measured 10 times at room temperature after directly placing in the Zetasizer unit. All the experiments were carried out in triplicate to calculate the average volume particle size distribution and good correlation was found between the measurements. According to the published results earlier, the self-nanoemulsifying efficiency is strongly associated with the mean droplet size of the produced emulsion in aqueous systems (Atef &amp; Belmonte, 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). It is worth mentioning that the size range of the SNEDDS nanoparticle is able to retain its performance and clarity even after further aqueous dilution. Polydispersity determination of the SNEDDS formulation systems was calculated from a cumulants analysis of the dynamic light scattering (DLS)-measured intensity autocorrelation function. The polydispersity index (PDI) explains the width of the assumed Gaussian standard distribution where a single particle size mode and an exponential fit is applied to the autocorrelation function.
