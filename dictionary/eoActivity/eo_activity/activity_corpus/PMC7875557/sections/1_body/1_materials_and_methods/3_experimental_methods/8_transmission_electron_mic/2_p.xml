<p>The surface morphology and globule sizes of the representative SNEDDS formulation were observed using TEM (Jeol JEM1010, Tokyo, Japan). The sample was prepared upon 10 times dilution with milliQ water (SNEDDS: milliQ âˆ’ 1:10 times). For analysis, a drop from the resulting nanoemulsion was placed on a film-coated copper grid to form a thin liquid film. These films were then negatively stained with 2% (w/v) phosphotungstic acid solution and then air-dried. The stained films were photographed by TEM.</p>
