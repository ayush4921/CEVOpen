<p>The antioxidant activity of the samples were evaluated using the 
 <italic>β</italic>-carotene bleaching method described by Velioglu et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>) with modifications. One milliliter (1 mL) of a 0.2 mg/mL solution of 
 <italic>β</italic> -carotene in chloroform was added to flasks containing 0.2 mL of Tween 20 and 0.02 mL of linoleic acid. The chloroform was removed in a rotary evaporator at 40 °C. The resulting mixture was then diluted with 100 mL of distilled water and mixed for approximately 2 min to form an emulsion. Similarly, another mixture was prepared without 
 <italic>β</italic>-carotene to use as a blank. A control containing 0.2 mL of 80% (v/v) methanol was also used instead of sample. Aliquot of the emulsion (5 mL) was added to 0.2 mL of the sample at 1 mg/mL. As a standard, Rutin (1 mg/mL) was used. The tubes were incubated in a water bath at 40 °C for 2 h. Absorbance was measured at 470 nm at 15 min intervals, using a UV–visible spectrophotometer (UV mini-1240, Shimadzu, Japan) and the antioxidant activity was calculated from the equation below:
