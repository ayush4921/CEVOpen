<p>SN and DN were dissolved in the representative SNEDDS at 80% loading based on their maximum equilibrium solubility determinations in the relevant anhydrous formulation. All the formulations investigated in the previous experiments were selected in the corresponding dynamic dispersion studies. The purpose was to examine if drug precipitation occurs during aqueous dispersion and to calculate the rate of precipitation. Accurately, 500 mg of formulation was dropped into 50 mL aqueous simulated intestinal media maintaining 1 in 100 dilution under fed (FeSSIF) and fated (FaSSIF) conditions and kept in a dry heat incubator at 37 °C for 24 h. Approximately, 1 mL of the dispersed sample from each container was withdrawn in an Eppendorf tube periodically during 24 h time, and centrifuged at 13,000 ×
