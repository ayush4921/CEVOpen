 <italic>In vivo</italic> animal studies were performed using only DN in the dose and SN was not included due to the different pharmacokinetic features of the SN and DN. The bioavailability of the optimized SNEDDS in the study for DN was compared with marketed product. Approximately 0.5 mL of blood samples was collected from the retro-orbital plexus in a heparinized tube at different time intervals (at 0.0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 72 h). Blood samples was then centrifuged at 5500 rpm for 15 min to separate the plasma was stored at −80 °C until analysis. The concentration of DN in plasma was determined by UHPLC as follow: A 775 μL of methanol was added to 225 μL aliquot of plasma. After vortex mixing for 1 min, the resultant was centrifuged at 5500 rpm for 10 min, and the organic layer was transferred to a clean tube and dried under a light stream of nitrogen at 45 °C. The residue was re-dissolved by 225 μL of mobile phase and 5 μL was injected by using HSS C18 (2.1 × 50 mm, 1.8 µm) analytical column. The nonlinear pharmacokinetic parameters such as
