<p>For antioxidant activity, DPPH (2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) free radical scavenging assay was employed. This method was carried out as previously described by Brand-Williams et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>). The method quantifies free radical scavenging capacity of the investigated samples. DPPH is a molecule that contains a stable free radical. In the presence of an antioxidant which is able to donate an electron to DPPH, the change in the absorbance at 517 nm is followed spectrophotometrically (UV mini-1240, Shimadzu, Japan). Various concentrations of DPPH (10, 50, 100, 500, and 1000 μg/mL) were used. The assay mixture was made up of a total volume of 1 mL, containing 500 μL of the sample, 125 μL of the prepared DPPH, and 375 μL of methanol. As positive control, ascorbic acid was used. The samples were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C, after which the decrease in absorbance was measured at 
 <italic>λ</italic> = 517 nm. Radical scavenging activity of the samples were calculated using the following equation below:
