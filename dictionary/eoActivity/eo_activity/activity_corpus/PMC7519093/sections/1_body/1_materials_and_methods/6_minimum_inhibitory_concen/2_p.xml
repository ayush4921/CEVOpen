<p id="Par14">Sterile 96-well microplates were filled with 95 µL of culture medium, 5 µL of bacterial suspension with 0.5 McFarland dilution and 100 µL of the essential oil at different concentrations. Then, plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h for bacterial strains and 48 h at 30 °C for yeast. The MIC was determined by means of the improvement of opacity or the change in color. The MIC was the lowest concentration of an antimicrobial that inhibited visible growth (absence of turbidity).</p>
