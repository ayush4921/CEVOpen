<p id="Par9">After complete drying, the samples were ground using a small electric mill. Each dried plant was weighed (100 g) and subjected to the extraction process by means of water distillation using Clevenger apparatus (made in Germany) for 5 h. The essential oil was dried by anhydrous sodium sulfate and after filtration was stored in dark bottles at 4 °C until use for further studies. Essential oil yield was calculated based on weight percent (w/w). This process was repeated three times for the oil from each plant part.</p>
