<p id="Par27">In this study, considering their promising composition, the antibacterial and antifungal activity of essential oils from 
 <italic>S. hydrangea</italic> leaves or flowers was assayed (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The ANOVA results showed that there was a significant difference between the mean inhibition halos obtained on treating different microorganisms with the essential oil of flowers and leaves of 
 <italic>S. hydrangea</italic> and antibiotics (P ≤ 0.05). The essential oil from 
 <italic>S. hydrangea</italic> leaves was especially active against Gram-positive bacteria including 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> as the inhibition halo was large irrespective of the concentration used (~ 9.50 mm), even if it was significantly lower than that obtained with rifampin (19, 44 and 21 mm) and gentamicin (30, 39 and 27 mm). Similarly, Kotan et al.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>
 </sup> reported a weak antibacterial effect of the essential oil against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (8 mm inhibition halo), while Sonboli et al.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>
 </sup> and Asadollahi et al.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>
 </sup>, detected a better antibacterial activity, especially against 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> which showed inhibition halos of 17 and 16 mm, respectively.
