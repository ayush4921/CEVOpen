<p id="Par36">The MBC value of essential oils from both leaves and flowers varied from 15.63 to 2000 µg/mL. The results underline that the MBC values provided by the oil from leaves were always equal to the MIC values except for that for 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>. Differently, MBC values provided by flower oil were higher than MIC values against Gram-negative bacteria (
 <italic>Shigella dysenteriae</italic>, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Proteus vulgaris</italic> and 
 <italic>Salmonella paratyphi-A</italic>), while they were similar for all the other microorganisms treated. To the best of our knowledge, the MBC has been investigated for the first time in this work, thus no comparison can be made with previous studies.
