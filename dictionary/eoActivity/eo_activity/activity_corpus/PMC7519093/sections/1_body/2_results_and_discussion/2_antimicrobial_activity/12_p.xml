<p id="Par37">The essential oils from 
 <italic>S. hydrangea</italic> leaves and flowers have a significant inhibitory and lethal effect, especially against the Gram-negative bacterium 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> for which the lowest MIC and MBC values were found (15.63 µg/mL). This bacterium may cause opportunistic and often nosocomial infections. This efficacy may be specific to the essential oils from the leaves and flowers of 
 <italic>S. hydrangea</italic>. Indeed, the activity of the genus 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> against 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> is strictly dependent on the species used. Many species of the genus 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> do not show any activity against this bacterium and a significant effect has only been reported for 
 <italic>Salvia mirzayanii</italic> Rech.f. &amp; Esfand.

 </sup>. Similarly, the antimicrobial effect against the bacteria 
 <italic>Shigella dysenteriae</italic> and 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, which may cause diarrhea and pneumonia, may vary as a function of the species used. In general, all 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> species have significant antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (
 <italic>Bacillus</italic>, 
 <italic>Klebsiella</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic>) and yeasts (
 <italic>Candida</italic> and 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic>). Therefore, the antimicrobial properties of 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> against food spoilage and food-borne pathogens suggest its use as a natural preservative in food applications
