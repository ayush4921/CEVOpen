<p>A mixture of ground, dried raw-sample was loaded into a stainless-steel reactor (30 mL, 65 mm length, and 16 mm ID) (Swagelok, Solon, OH, USA), as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03872-f001">Figure 1</xref>. The steel reactor was then filled with water in accordance with the designated solvent-to-sample ratio. Subsequently, the reactor was surged with argon gas to remove the presence of trapped air. The cap was then secured to completely seal the reactor. Prior to the extraction, the oil bath was preheated to the desired temperature (100–271 °C). As soon as the heating bath (oil or salt bath) reached the set temperature, the reactor (filled with sample and water 0.08–0.22 gr/mL) was immersed in the bath. The bath is equipped with an agitator, which serves to distribute the heat evenly during the extraction process (

Once the reactor was cooled down, the mixture, comprising sample and solvent, was transferred to a test tube for further purification and separation of essential oil, through the liquid-liquid extraction method, which is described in the following section.
