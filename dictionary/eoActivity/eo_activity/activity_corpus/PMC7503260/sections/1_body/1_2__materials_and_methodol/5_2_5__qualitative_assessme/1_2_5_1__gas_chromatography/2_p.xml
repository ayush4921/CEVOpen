<p>Firstly, the chemical compounds were identified through their retention indices relative to n-alkanes indices on a HP-5 column. The retention indices were determined using the retention times of n-alkanes (C
 <sub>5</sub>-C
 <sub>30</sub>), which were analysed using the same instrument and under the same chromatographic conditions. NIST and WILEY libraries were used to identify the chemical compounds of the essential oils. Relative amount of the individual component was based on percentage compositions of the essential oil, calculated by way of a computerized integrator, using the total ion chromatograms.
