<p>FTIR analysis was used to conduct the functional group examination. Initially, the wood samples were oven-dried overnight at 383 K. Next, an adequate amount of the dried powdered sample was finely mixed with KBr at a ratio of 1:100, and pressed into pellet form through a pressure of 100 kg/cm
 <sup>2</sup>. Infrared spectra were obtained by scanning the prepared pellets with a spectrometer (Thermo Nicolet FTIR). Dry air was continuously surged into the spectrometer to get rid of water vapour. FTIR spectra of the samples were recorded in the range of 400–4000 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, and a resolution of x cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. Scanning by the FTIR spectrophotometer was at the rate of 200 scans per second. A plot of infrared radiation intensity, against wave number (known as the infrared spectrum), was recorded for the wood samples of 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic>’, to qualitatively identify the surface functional groups of the samples. Subsequently, the spectrum of the untreated sample was compared to the spectra of the wood samples, after they were subjected to the HD and SCWE process. This is to analyse the value of the extraction method with regards to the breaking of chemical bonds, which consequently determines the effectiveness of the method, for the extraction of essential oils.
