<p>The liquid part of the mixture, containing water and essential oil (aqueous mixture), was poured into a separation funnel, and the liquid-liquid extraction process proceeded with the addition of 5 mL of n-hexane, for the removal of essential oil from the mixture. The liquid-liquid extraction process was replicated twice to ensure that no essential oil remained in the water. The hexane was removed with the use of a rotary evaporator. In the final step, sodium sulphate anhydrous was applied to the essential oil to remove any moisture or water. The extracted essential oils were stored in a dark-sealed-vial at 4 °C for further analysis. The yield of each essential oil was calculated with the following equation:
