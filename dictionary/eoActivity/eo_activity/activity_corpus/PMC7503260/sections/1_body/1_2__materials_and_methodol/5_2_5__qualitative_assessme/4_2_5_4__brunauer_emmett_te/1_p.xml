<p>Specific surface area and pore size distributions of 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic>’ wood, before and after extraction by HD and SCWE, were measured with the use of a Micromeritics (USA), to assess the amount of nitrogen adsorption/desorption at 77 K. For measuring the surface area and pore size, the samples were degassed at 50 °C under vacuum, and subjected to a relative pressure of 0.99 atm. Then, the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method was applied to measure the BET surface area and full adsorption isotherms of all the samples.
