<p>Model validation was performed at optimum conditions, with RSM at 225 °C for 13 min, and a wood-to-water ratio of 0.2 gr/mL, to deliver a predicted yield 16.999 µL. The extraction of essential oil from 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> wood, under optimum conditions, resulted in a relatively high yield of 16 µL. This validated the effectiveness of the model as the experimental and predicted values were close to similar (minor relative error oil yield = 0.699). Thus, it can be surmised that the empirical model derived from the RSM experimental design can adequately describe the relationship between the independent variables and the response of the system.
