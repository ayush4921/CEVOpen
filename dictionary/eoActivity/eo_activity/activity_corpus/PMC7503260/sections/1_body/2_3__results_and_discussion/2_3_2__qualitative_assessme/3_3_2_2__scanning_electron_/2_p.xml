<p>The SEM results verified our hypothesis that SCWE improves oil extraction through (i) the rupturing of cell walls and (ii) the modification of the properties of water as the solvent. 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> wood is made up of a structure comprising lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose. Cellulose is a long chain of glucose units connected by Î²(1, 4) glycosidic linkages. The mechanical strength and chemical stability of these long chains stem from the existence of intra- and inter-molecular hydrogen bonds between them. However, with SCWE, the high temperature and pressure reduces the polarity of water to render its behaviour similar to an organic solvent. The weakening of water polarity also disturbs the intra- and inter-molecular hydrogen bonds between the chains, making them fragile and considerably susceptible to cell wall rupture. This facilitates the deeper penetration of solvents into the plant matrix during the extraction process. Simultaneously, the density and viscosity of water is reduced to promote diffusivity, and boost the mass transfer of essential oil into the solvents for better extraction efficiency [
