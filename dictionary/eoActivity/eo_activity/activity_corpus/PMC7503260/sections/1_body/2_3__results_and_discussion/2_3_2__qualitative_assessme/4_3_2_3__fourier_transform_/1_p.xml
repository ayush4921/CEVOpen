<p>Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to assess the effect of SCWE on the chemical structure of 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> wood. The FTIR spectra of untreated 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> wood (the control sample), following HD and SCWE extraction, are depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03872-f006">Figure 6</xref>. The three spectra were compared within a range of 400–4000 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. The spectrum of untreated 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> wood (control sample) was identical to the spectrum of the wood after HD extraction. The similarity of these spectra, considering the SEM result, indicates that hydro-distillation, despite its long duration (16 h), failed to break down the lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, and insoluble starch to extract carbohydrate compounds. Therefore, both the FTIR and the SEM results verify the inability of HD to effectively break down the cell walls of 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> wood and extract its essential oil. This result explains the lower yield of essential oil extracted through HD, in comparison to SCWE.
