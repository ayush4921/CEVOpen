 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03872-f003">Figure 3</xref>c depicts the effect of both extraction time and the sample-to-solvent ratio at 182.5 °C. It was observed that an increase in both parameters led to a climb in the yield of essential oil. The greatest yield of essential oil was obtained when the sample-to-solvent ratio was in the range of 0.15–0.2 gr/mL, and the extraction time was equal and greater than 17 min. As portrayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03872-f003">Figure 3</xref>a,b, low water polarity, brought about by an ideal temperature and short processing time, improves the yield of essential oil extraction. The results from response surface analysis and regression analysis verified that in terms of subcritical water extraction of 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> wood essential oil, temperature is the most influential factor, followed by time and sample-to-water ratio.
