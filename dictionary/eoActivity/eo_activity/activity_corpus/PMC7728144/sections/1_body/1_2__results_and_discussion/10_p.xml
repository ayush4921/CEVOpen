<p>Here, we report the in vivo efficacy of EO-ML against 
 <italic>L. amazonensis</italic> infection by using 30 mg/kg for 15 days, with a four-day interval by the subcutaneous route, for a total of five doses. In other studies, however, higher numbers of doses and concentrations of antileishmanial products were usually employed in the animals, aiming to enhance their efficacy. For example, oil from the trunk of 
 <italic>Copaifera martii</italic> Hayne was administered at 100 mg/kg/day for 30 days [

 <italic>Carapa guianensis</italic> Aubl. Was performed for eight weeks using 100â€“160 mg/kg/day [
