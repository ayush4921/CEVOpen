<p>The studied EO-ML presented 45 compounds (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05514-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), which constituted 99.9% of the composition and were represented by monoterpene hydrocarbons (10.5%), oxygenated monoterpenoids (79.2%), sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (0.2%), oxygenated sesquiterpenoids (9.6%), benzenoids (0.3%) and others (0.1%). The main components were 1,8-cineole or eucalyptol with 61%, which is a characteristic chemotype of 
 <italic>M. leucadendra</italic> as demonstrated Brophy et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-05514" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and An et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-05514" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In addition, other compounds at lower concentrations were identified, such as α-terpineol (15.6%), viridiflorol (7.9%), limonene (4.8%) α- and β-pinene (2.7 and 1.2%, respectively) and terpinen-4-ol (1.2%), which have also been previously reported for EO-ML [
