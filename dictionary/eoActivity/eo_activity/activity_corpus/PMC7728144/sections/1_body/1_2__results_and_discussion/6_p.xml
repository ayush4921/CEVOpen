<p>Follow-up studies were carried out on kinetoplastid parasites that showed higher susceptibility to EO-ML. In this case, the evaluation of 1,8 cineole against 
 <italic>L. amazonensis</italic> and 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic> parasites was performed. It is an important strategy for its applicability and can facilitate the search for the biological mechanism by which the oil may act [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-05514" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In addition, although the oils are complex mixtures, a major compound may have a greater influence on the observed biological activity [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-05514" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In this study, however, 1,8 cineole showed IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 68.3 ± 3.4 µg/mL (0.44 ± 0.02 mM) and 30.3 ± 1.5 µg/mL (0.19 ± 0.01 mM) against 
 <italic>L. amazonensis</italic> and 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic>, respectively. Furthermore, no cytotoxicity was observed against non-malignant macrophages at 200 µg/mL. Thus, 1,8 cineole is not the main agent responsible for the antiprotozoal activity of EO-ML. Nibret and Wink reported an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 83.1 µg/mL for this compound against 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic> [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-25-05514" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. On the other hand, Machado et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-25-05514" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] documented that this pure compound did not display an important inhibitory activity on 
 <italic>L. infantum</italic>, which represented 58.6% of the 
 <italic>Thymus capitellatus</italic> Hoffmanns &amp; Link EO; while Santana et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-05514" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and Camargos et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-05514" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] showed that 1,8-cineole was able to inhibit the growth of 
 <italic>L. amazonensis</italic> with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 48.4 μg/mL (0.3 mM) and 724 μg/mL (4.7 mM) against amastigotes and promastigotes, respectively. Therefore, the activity of EO-ML could result from the complex interactions between their constituents. In some cases, these interactions may lead to antagonistic or synergistic effects that contribute to the biological activity of EOs, and even minor components of EOs can play a critical role in these effects. There have been a few studies concerning antikinetoplastid actions of the minor EO-ML constituents. For example, some authors showed IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of: 4.2 μg/mL for limonene, 1.0 μg/mL for α-pinene [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-05514" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], 47.4 μg/mL for β-pinene [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-05514" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and 0.02 μg/mL for terpinen-4-ol [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-05514" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] against 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic>; as well as 37.9 μg/mL for limonene [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-05514" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] 105 μg/mL for α-terpineol [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-05514" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and 37 μg/mL for α-pinene [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-05514" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] against 
 <italic>L. amazonensis</italic>. Although the concentrations of these compounds were less than 1,8-cineole, the presence of known components with antikinetoplastid activity in the oil could, therefore, account for the inhibitory effect found for EO-ML. Nevertheless, further studies with minor components or compound combinations are needed to identify the compound(s) responsible for the effects of EO-ML.
