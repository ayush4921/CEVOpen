<p>In addition, the EO-ML showed inhibitory activity against tested malignant cell lines, including resistant sublines, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 55 to 98 μg/mL. The anticancer potential of various EOs has attracted a great deal of interest, and extensive research has been carried out to characterize the anticancer activity, the molecular mechanisms, the chemopreventive potential, and the chemotherapeutic application of these products [

 <sub>50</sub> values below 30 μg/mL [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-05514" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], the antiproliferative property of the EO-ML could be in consideration, particularly against resistant sublines. Currently, either intrinsic or acquired resistance during the course of treatment is a limiting factor in successful cancer chemotherapy and constitutes one of the major challenges for cancer chemotherapy [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-05514" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In this regard, the most interesting result of the studied EO was its capability to limit the growth of resistant sublines, as well as other malignant susceptible cell lines, which may lead to further studies to prevent or attack proliferation of resistant malignant cells as a needed therapeutic strategy.
