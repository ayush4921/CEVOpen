<p>The positive effect observed in animals treated with EO-ML, could be explained by the direct activity of the oil on the growth of the parasite, as shown in the in-vitro assays. Nevertheless, the efficacy exhibited in the murine model could also be associated with the ability of oil constituents to induce indirect effects that can contribute to controlling a
