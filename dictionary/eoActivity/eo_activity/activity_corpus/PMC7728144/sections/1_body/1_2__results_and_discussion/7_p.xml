<p>Note that the previous report of this plant against bacteria, fungi, and parasites was conducted with an aqueous ethanolic extract [

 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-05514" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Although the chemical composition of this extract was not reported, the different procedures for solvent extraction and EO hydrodistillation will result in very different chemical compositions, marked mainly in relatively polar, non-volatile in the ethanol extract, and volatile non-polar compounds in the EO [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-25-05514" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Nevertheless, antiparasitic activities were displayed by both the ethanol extract and the EO, which strongly suggests the potentialities of
