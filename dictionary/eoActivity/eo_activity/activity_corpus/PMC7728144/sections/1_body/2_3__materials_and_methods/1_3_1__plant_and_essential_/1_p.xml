<p>Aerial parts (leaves and stems) of 
 <italic>M. leucadendra</italic> plant were collected during early hours of the morning in March 2015 at National Botany Garden (NBG), Havana, Cuba, and a specimen was deposited at the Herbarium of Cuban Flora of the NBG and authenticated by M.Sc. Eldys Bécquer (voucher number: 8501918). Leaves of 
 <italic>M. leucadendra</italic> were manually selected, rinsed with abundant water, and crushed into small pieces. Immediately, the fresh vegetal material was conventionally hydrodistilled using a Clevenger-type apparatus for 5 h, and the EO-ML was obtained, yielding 0.8%. The essential oil was stored in a sealed amber vial at 4 °C until analysis and screening.
