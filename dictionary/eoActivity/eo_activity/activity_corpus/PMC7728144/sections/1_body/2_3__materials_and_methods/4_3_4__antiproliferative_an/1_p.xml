<p>To determine the activity of the EO on malignant cells, the following cancer cell lines were used: (i) 22Rv1 (human prostate carcinoma, ATCC
 <sup>®</sup> CRL-2505TM) cultivated in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco-Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) supplemented with RPMI-1640 Vitamins (PanEco, Moscow, Russia), (ii) MCF-7 (human breast cancer, ATCC
 <sup>®</sup> HTB-22) cells, as well (iii) MCF-7/Rap and (iv) MCF-7/4OHTAMO resistant sublines (The rapamycin-resistant MCF-7/Rap and 4OH-tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7/4OHTAMO sublines were established from the parent MCF-7 cells by long-term rapamycin or 4OH-tamoxifen treatment, respectively), and (v) EFO-21 (ovary cystadenocarcinoma, DSMZ ACC 235) cultured in standard 4.5 g/L glucose DMEM medium (Gibco-Life Technologies, Paisley, UK). In all cases, culture was supplemented with 10% FCSi, antibiotics (50 μg of streptomycin/mL and 50 U of penicillin/mL) and 0.1 mg/mL sodium pyruvate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) and maintained in a NuAir incubator (NuAir, Plymouth, MN, USA) at 37 °C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> and 80–85% humidity. Then, 100 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> 22Rv1 cells/well, 40 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> MCF-7, MCF-7/Rap or MCF-7/4OHTAMO cells/well, and 110 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> EFO-21 cells/well were seeded into 24-well plates in 900 μL of the medium, and the plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Follow, different concentrations of EO were added and the plates were incubated for 72 h under the same conditions, which the cellular viability was assessed using the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; AppliChem GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany) at 0.2 mg/mL per well [

 <xref rid="B49-molecules-25-05514" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. After additional incubation of 2 h, the supernatant was discarded, the MTT formazan purple crystals were dissolved in DMSO (350 μL per well), and the absorbance was measured at 571 nm and 630 nm as a reference in a MultiScan reader (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA) after the plates were gently shaken.
