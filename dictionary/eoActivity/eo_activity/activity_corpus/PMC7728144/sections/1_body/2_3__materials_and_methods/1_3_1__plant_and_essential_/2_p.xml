<p>A sample of 100 µL was used to carry out the chemical characterization by GC-MS using a Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 Ultra (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Columbia, MD, USA). A 5% 
 <italic>w/v</italic> solution of the sample in CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub> was prepared and 0.1 μL was injected with a splitting mode (30:1). In this case, a ZB-5 fused silica capillary column with (5% phenyl)-polymethylsiloxane as stationary phase (film thickness of 0.25 μm, a length of 30 m, and an internal diameter of 0.25 mm (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) and the carrier gas was helium (column head pressure of 552 kPa, flow rate of 1.37 mL/min, injector temperature of 250 °C and an ion source temperature of 200 °C) were used. Equipment operated in the electron impact (EI) mode (electron energy = 70 eV), scan range = 40–400 atomic mass units, scan rate = 3.0 scans/s and GC-MS solution software. The GC oven temperature program was set to 50 °C as the initial temperature, which increased at 2 °C/min until 260 °C. Finally, identification of the oil components was based on their retention indices (RI) determined by reference to a homologous series of 
 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes, and by comparison of their mass spectral fragmentation patterns with those reported in the literature [
