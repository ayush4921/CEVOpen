<p>For antitrypanosomal activity, two species were included: 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic> (Squib-427) and 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> (Tulahuen CL2). For 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic>, 1.5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> trypomastigotes cultured in Hirumi-9 medium supplemented with 10% inactivated fetal calf serum (FCSi; Invitrogen, Belgium) and tested products were added in a 96-well plate and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 72 h [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-25-05514" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Then, parasite growth was assessed fluorimetrically using 20 µL of resazurin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 50 µg/mL. The plate was incubated for an additional 24 h under the same conditions and read at 530 nm excitation and 590 nm emission in a Tecan GENios Multifunction Fluorimeter (Tecan Group, Maennedorf, Switzerland). On the other hand, EO at different concentrations was added to 4 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> amastigotes in 4 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> MRC-5 cells using minimal essential medium (MEM; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 20 mM 
 <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, 16.5 mM sodium bicarbonate, and 5% of FCSi in a plate of 96-wells and incubated for seven days at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. In this case, parasite viability was determined colorimetrically by adding the β-galactosidase substrate chlorophenol red β-
 <sc>d</sc>-galactopyranoside (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Finally, the absorbance was read at 540 nm after 4 h of incubation at 37 °C [
