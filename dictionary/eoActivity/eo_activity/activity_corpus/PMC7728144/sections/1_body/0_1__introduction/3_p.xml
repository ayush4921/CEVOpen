 <italic>Melaleuca</italic> species are tall shrubs and small trees having a height of up to 7 m with a bushy crown and papery bark. Leaves are usually hairless, 10â€“35 mm long and about 1 mm wide, while the phyllotaxis of leaves is scattered to whorled. The leaves have prominent glands enriched with aromatic oil [
