<p id="Par31">Alkaloids are another class of compounds present in most species of basal angiosperms. In studies with species of the genus 
 <italic>Ocotea</italic> (family Lauraceae), the chemical composition of the essential oil was found to beÂ rich in alkaloids, which are associated with phytotoxic, larvicidal and antibacterial activities

 <italic>Guatteria</italic> sp. (family Annonaceae) have antitumor, antimalarial, antifungal and mutagenic activities

The chemical composition and biological activity of essential oils from species of basal angiosperms may be related, as their compounds are detoxification products of harmful substances generated by the primary metabolism of plants, acting as allelopathic agents, which can inhibit germination owing to their chelating and/or cytotoxic power
