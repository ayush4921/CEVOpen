 </sup>, the effects of allelochemicals on plants are only a secondary reflection of internal changes. Hence, the impact of allelochemicals on germination and seedling growth are secondary manifestations of effects at the cellular level. In other words, germination occurrence and speed, when analyzed separately, do not always indicate an allelopathic effect, but such an effect can be confirmed by combined analyses at both macroscopic and microscopic levels.
