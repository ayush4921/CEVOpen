<p id="Par36">Alterations such as lost chromosomes, micronuclei, delay in anaphase and c-metaphases characterize aneugenic action (i.e. inhibition of mitotic spindle fibers) of the chemical substances. Both lost chromosomes and fragments can result in micronuclei. Oliveira

 </sup> reported that the frequency of micronuclei observed in root meristem cells of 
 <italic>Allium cepa</italic> indicates the action of aneugenic substances. These alterations are closely related to the morphological responses of plants and their growth, development and photosynthesis. Aneugenic compounds act directly on the DNA, inhibiting the repair mechanism of the cell. The delay in anaphase is also related to depolymerization of the microtubules, resulting in uneven dragging of the chromosomes. In addition, it causes the cell to have a deformed nuclear membrane, aiming to envelop all the genetic material to it and then the deformation is undone

 </sup>. In c-metaphases, the microtubules are completely inactivated, preventing the spindle formation

 </sup>. The continued presence of c-metaphases can lead to duplication in the number of chromosomes of these cells.
