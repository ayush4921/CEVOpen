<p id="Par15">For each 
 <italic>S. botocudorum</italic> and 
 <italic>S. tupiniquinorum</italic> essential oil, five concentrations were evaluated: 3,000 ppm, 1,500 ppm, 750 ppm, 375 ppm and 187.5 ppm. The concentrations were obtained by diluting the oil in the solvent dichloromethane (99.5%). Distilled water and dichloromethane were used as negative controls (C−), and glyphosate (1 mL/L) as positive control (C +) . Twenty-five seeds each of 
 <italic>L. sativa</italic> and 
 <italic>S. bicolor</italic> were placed in Petri dishes (9 cm of diameter), with five repetitions, totalling 125 seeds for each treatment. The seeds were placed on filter paper moistened with 2.5 mL of oil diluted in the solvent. Petri dishes were arranged in a completely randomized design (CRD) and placed in Biochemical Oxygen Demand (B.O.D.) at 24 °C throughout the experiment. The percentage of germinated seeds was observed after 8, 16, 24, 36 and 48 h of exposure to the treatments. Root and shoot growth were determined after 48 and 96 h of exposure to the oils, respectively, using a digital caliper. From the data obtained, the following variables were evaluated: germination rate (radicle protrusion) after 48 h (G%) = total of germinated seeds/total of treatment seeds × 100; germination speed index (GSI) = (N1 * 1) + (N2 − N1) * 1/2 + (N3N2) * 1/3 + … (Ny − (Ny − 1)) * 1/y, where 
 <italic>Ny</italic> represents the number of germinated seeds in a given period and 
 <italic>y</italic> represents the total number of evaluation periods
