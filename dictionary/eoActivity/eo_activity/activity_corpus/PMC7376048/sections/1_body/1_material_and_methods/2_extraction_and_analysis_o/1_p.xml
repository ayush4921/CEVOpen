The flask was then coupled to the apparatus, where the oil was extracted for three hours after water boiling. The obtained hydrolate was centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 3 min to promote the separation between the aqueous and oily phases. With the aid of a Pasteur pipette, the (supernatant) oil was removed and stored in an amber bottle in a freezer at − 20 °C, protected from light
