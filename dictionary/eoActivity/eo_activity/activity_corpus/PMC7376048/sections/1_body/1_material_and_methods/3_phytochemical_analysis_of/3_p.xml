<p id="Par13">Identification of the essential oil components was accomplished by comparing the obtained mass spectra with the mass spectra available in spectrographic databases (Wiley 7, NIST 05 and NIST 05 s). In addition, the Kovats Retention Index(KRI) of each compound was calculated using a mixture of C7–C40 saturated alkanes (Supelco-USA) and the adjusted retention time of each compound, obtained via GC-FID, then compared with those in the literature
