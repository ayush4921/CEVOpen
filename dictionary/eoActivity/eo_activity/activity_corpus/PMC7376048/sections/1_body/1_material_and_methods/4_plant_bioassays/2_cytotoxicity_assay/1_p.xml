<p id="Par16">After 48 h of exposure, the roots of ten lettuce seeds were removed and fixed in Carnoy I (3:1 methanol + acetic acid) , then stored at − 20 °C for at least 24 h. Only lettuce roots were used in this assay, as they are considered a suitable model for microscopic analysis to test the toxic effect of chemical compounds

 </sup>. Lettuce roots show high proliferative activity, fast growth, a high number of seeds, many chromosomes, high sensitivity to mutagenic and genotoxic compounds, and easy-to-manipulate roots

 </sup>. First, root tips were hydrolyzed in 5 N HCl at room temperature for 18 min. Next, the meristematic region was removed and placed on a slide, stained with 2% acetic orcein, covered with acoverslip, and crushed. Each slide was prepared using two treated meristems, with five slides being evaluated per treatment (one slide for each Petri dish). One thousand cells were evaluated per slide, totaling 5,000 meristematic cells observed per treatment. The following parameters were analyzed: mitotic index (MI) , calculated as the number of dividing cells as a fraction of the total number of cells; chromosomal aberrations (CA) , expressed as the percentage of each aberration—lost chromosomes, adherent chromosomes, chromosomal fragments, chromosomal bridges, c-metaphases and chromosomal polyploidization—divided by the total number of cells; and nuclear aberrations (NC), determined by the frequency of condensed nuclei and micronucleated cells in interphase
