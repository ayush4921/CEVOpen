<p id="Par18">The extraction efficiency of 
 <italic>S. botocudorum</italic> and 
 <italic>S. tupiniquinorum</italic> essential oils was 0.34% and 0.43%, respectively, by fresh leaf fraction. By means of the chromatographic analyses, five compounds were identified in the essential oils of these species (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In the essential oil from 
 <italic>S. botocudorum</italic>, the major compound was germacrene D (33.2%), followed by bicyclogermacrene (23.4%) , germacrene A (17.7) , β-elemene (8.4%) and trans-nerolidol (7.7%) . The major compound in 
 <italic>S. tupiniquinorum</italic> was also germacrene D (44.8%), followed by bicyclogermacrene (16.9%), γ-cadinene (15%), germacrene A (8.7) and β-elemene (5.1%). Only one chemical compound differentiated the two species, namely trans-nerolidol in 
 <italic>S. botocudorum</italic> and γ-cadinene in 
 <italic>S. tupiniquinorum</italic>.
