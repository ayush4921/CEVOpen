<p id="Par21">The essential oil from 
 <italic>S. tupiniquinorum</italic> had no effect on the germination of 
 <italic>L. sativa</italic> seeds (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a); treatment means were similar to negative controls. However, GSI was inhibited at the highest concentration, matching the positive control. Root length was also reduced in the seeds exposed to the treatments at 3,000, 1,500, 750 and 375 ppm when compared with the negative controls. For the variable shoot length, it was observed that the treatments with 3,000 and 1,500 ppm of the oil were similar to glyphosate.
