<p id="Par20">For the treatments performed with 
 <italic>S. bicolor</italic> seeds, a germination percentage close to that of seeds exposed to negative controls was observed at all tested concentrations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). GSI was also unaffected by the essential oils. In turn, root length was the most affected variable, with a reduction more effective than glyphosate observed at all tested concentrations, except at 1,500 ppm. Shoot growth was inhibited at the concentration of 3,000 ppm, presenting means close to the positive control; means for the other concentrations were close to the negative controls.
