<p id="Par22">In the test with 
 <italic>S. bicolor</italic> seeds, the germination percentage, at all tested concentrations, showed means close to the negative control (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). However, for GSI, the concentration of 3,000 ppm was similar to treatment with glyphosate. Root length was the most affected variable; all concentrations, except 187.5 ppm, inhibited root growth more than glyphosate did. For shoot length, significant inhibition was observed at the two highest concentrations.
