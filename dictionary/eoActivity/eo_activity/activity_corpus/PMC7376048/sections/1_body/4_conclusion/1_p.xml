<p id="Par38">The essential oils from 
 <italic>S. botocudorum</italic> and 
 <italic>S. tupiniquinorum</italic> showed phytotoxic effects on both monocot and eudicot specimens. In addition, they demonstrated aneugenic and clastogenic mechanisms of action, promoting DNA and mitotic spindle damage. Therefore, the essential oils of these species are promising among the choices for new substances with potential biological activities.
