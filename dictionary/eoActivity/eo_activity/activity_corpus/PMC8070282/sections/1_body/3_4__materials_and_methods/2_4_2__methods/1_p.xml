<p>The assays were performed using an Agilent Technologies 6890N gas chromatograph (Wilmington, DE, USA), combined with an MSD 5973 mass spectrometer and split/splitless injection chamber with an HP-INNOWax polar capillary column (60 m × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.5 µm d
 <sub>f</sub>). The chromatographic separation conditions were set to separate the peaks of the analyzed components from each other and dichloromethane. The chromatographic oven operated in the temperature range 50–240 °C based on the following programmable conditions: 50° for 2 min, ramping by 5 °C/min up to 80 °C. Then, the temperature ramped by 10 °C/min up to 120 °C and then finally by 20 °C/min to 240 °C. The carrier gas was helium, administered at a flow rate of 1 mL/min, and 1 µL injections (split 20:1) at 250 °C were made by autosampler. The leak from the chromatographic column was analyzed after electron ionization (EI), whereas the obtained positive ions were registered in scan mode within the range 10–350 Th. The obtained mass spectra were compared with standards given in the NIST11 or FFNSC3 spectrum databases (Mass Spectra of Flavors and Fragrances of Natural and Synthetic Compounds, 3rd Edition).
