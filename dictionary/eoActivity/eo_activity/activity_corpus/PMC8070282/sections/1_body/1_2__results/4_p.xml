<p>In contrast, in the P4 spectra, sesquiterpene alcohols clearly predominated (49%), while the compounds detected in the previous oils (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02249-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) were present in minute quantities. Of these, high amounts of polysantol (9.2%) and javanol isomers (24.4%) were observed (

In addition, linalool (3.6%), linalyl acetate (3.9%) and farnesyl acetate isomers (3.2%) were unique to this oil (P4).
