<p>Despite being manufactured by different companies, oils P1 and P2 did not differ qualitatively or quantitatively. In both, the main peak corresponded to valerianol (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02249-f002">Figure 2</xref>), sesquiterpene alcohol with retention time (RT) of 22.19 min; this appeared to constitute 14.5% of the total content (
