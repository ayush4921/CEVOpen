<p>P6 differed from the other oil samples. The predominant compounds were α- and β-santalol (

 <xref rid="molecules-26-02249-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>); no valerianol, eudesmol or elemol isomers were detected. A unique sesquiterpene profile was identified: sesquiterpenes constituted 9.1% of the total content, and these included a range of different santalene isomers (5.9%) and α-himachalen (3.2%) (
