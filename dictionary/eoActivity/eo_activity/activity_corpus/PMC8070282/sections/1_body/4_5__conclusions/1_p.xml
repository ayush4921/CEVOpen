  <list-item>
   <p>Three samples (P1, P2 and P3) were obtained from

    <italic>Santalum album</italic>;

  <list-item>
   <p>Two oils (P4 and P5) were synthetic mixtures, which were supposed to imitate sandalwood fragrance. While P4 was labeled as being obtained from 
    <italic>Santalum album</italic>, it turned out to be a mixture of chemical substances synthesized under laboratory conditions. The manufacturer of P5 did not indicate any source of origin.
