<p>The oil examined in our study had an α-santalol content slightly lower than literature values of 
 <italic>Santalum album</italic> oils (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02249-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) but higher than the oil obtained from 
 <italic>Santalum spicatum</italic>. The β-santalol content approximated that determined by Kačániová et al. [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-26-02249" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], Panto et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-02249" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and Góra and Gibka [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-02249" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Our results confirm that the examined oil was obtained from 
 <italic>Santalum album</italic>; however, it does not fulfill ISO 3518:2002 standard [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-26-02249" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] due to an insufficient α-santalol content (&lt;41%).
