<p>The “sandalwood oils” examined in the present study may have completely different profiles, and hence, different biological properties to authentic 
 <italic>Santalum album</italic> oil. Our data indicate that, while the P1, P2 and P3 oils differed quantitatively, they have similar qualitative content: all three samples contained valerianol and various eudesmol isomers, components characteristic of 
 <italic>Amyris balsamifera</italic>. With this in mind, oils P1 and P2 were correctly labeled, while P3, labeled “
 <italic>Santalum album</italic> 100% bionatural”, was not: it did not contain any components characteristic of 
 <italic>Santalum album</italic> oil. Sesquiterpene alcohols, such as valerianol and eudesmol, appear to be the main components of 
 <italic>Amyris balsamifera</italic> oils [
