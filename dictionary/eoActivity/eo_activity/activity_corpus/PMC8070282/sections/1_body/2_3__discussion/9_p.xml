<p>The main component of P5 was benzyl benzoate (74.6%) (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-02249-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), which is commonly used in the chemical, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-26-02249" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This substance can be detected in natural conditions, being present in some plants, but it can also be obtained by chemical synthesis [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-26-02249" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Other P5 components, such as isopropyl myristate (bisomel) or bacdanol (sesquiterpene alcohol), are also synthetic compounds and have a scent resembling that of sandalwood fragrance [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-26-02249" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In addition, the thujopsene, cedrene and cedrol observed in P5 were also detected in other investigated samples, particularly those obtained from 
 <italic>Amyris balsamifera</italic>. Hence, P5 appears to be a mixture of natural and synthetic components, which imitate the scent of sandalwood oil. No origin is given on the packaging; however, the description contains information about the presence of allergenic ingredients, following EU and EU Council Act no. 1223/2009 [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-02249" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], concerning cosmetic products. Benzyl benzoate is placed in the top position in the ingredient list as the most important mixture component.
