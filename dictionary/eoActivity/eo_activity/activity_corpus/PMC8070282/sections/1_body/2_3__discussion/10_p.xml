<p>In addition, oil P4 also was found to have unique content. A comparison of its mass spectra with the FFNSC3 database enabled us to identify two javanol isomers with identical mass spectra, two ebanol isomers and polysantol. All of these compounds are synthetic substitutes, imitating the scent of sandalwood [

 <xref rid="B30-molecules-26-02249" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Although such synthetic oils are easy to distinguish from natural ones using GCâ€“MS, it is difficult to confirm the identity of individual peaks due to an absence of standard mass spectra in commonly accessed databases, such as NIST or Wiley. While some matches can be found in fragrance mass spectra databases, such as FFNSC3, it is impossible to distinguish isomers of components with the same mass spectra (e.g., javanol I and javanol II).
