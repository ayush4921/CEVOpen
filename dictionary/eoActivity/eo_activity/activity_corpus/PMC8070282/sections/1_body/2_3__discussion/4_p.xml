<p>The above-described effect of sandalwood oil is attributed either to its main component (α‑santalol) or to the entire mixture of active substances contained in this oil. Therefore, it is important that the oil used for medicinal purposes has a composition known to elicit the effects described above. However, the quality of the available oils, even at the source, i.e., in the country of origin, leaves much to be desired: of the 28 commercially available sandalwood oils produced in various provinces of India, less than 1/3 met the requirements of the India standard IS 329–2004 [

 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-02249" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The requirements of this standard are similar to those of ISO 3518:2002, which indicates that the acceptable range of α-santalol content is 41–55% and β-santalol 16–27% [

 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-02249" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] were characterized by α-santalol levels from 0 to 54.28% and β-santalol from 0 to 25.94%, no santalols were found at all in 15 samples. The main adulterants were diethyl phthalate and diethylhexyl phthalate, which constituted up to 44% and 80%, respectively, in some of the commercial samples. The chromatographic profile of many samples also differed from the standard’s requirements and the chromatograms of reference samples created by the authors [
