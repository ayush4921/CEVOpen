<p>CSEO has the lowest IC50 (4.7 mg.mL
 <sup>–1</sup>) against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, this amount significantly better than AGEO (19.1), CLEO (16.2), and ZOEO (14.0) (oneway ANOVA, sig &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, ADEO and CZEO with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 6.1 and 7.2 mg. mL
 <sup>–1</sup>, respectively, showed good antibacterial activity, and their IC
 <sub>50</sub> were not significantly different from CSEO (one-way ANOVA, sig &gt; 0.05). 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is a Gram-negative rod found in soil, water, and skin flora. An opportunistic microorganism in which severe infection often occurs during existing diseases or conditions, such as damaged tissues, cystic fibrosis, and wound burns, is common in acute illness, especially hospital-acquired infections. Treatment of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infections can be difficult due to its natural resistance to antibiotics (multidrug-resistant pathogen) (
