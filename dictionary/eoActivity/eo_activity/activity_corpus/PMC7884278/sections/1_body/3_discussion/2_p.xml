<p>Effect of CZEO on 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> was significantly better than the other examined EO (one-way ANOVA, sig &lt; 0.05); IC
 <sub>50</sub> (LCL-UCL): 1.0 (0.5–2.0) mg.mL
 <sup>–1</sup>. However, the calculated IC
 <sub>50</sub> for ZOEO (189.8) and AGEO (101.9) differ substantially against this bacterium, but they were also larger than the total IC

 <italic>E. coli</italic> is a Gram-negative, facultative anaerobe rod and a genus of Enterobacteriaceae. Most strains of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> are harmless and are part of the normal microbiota of the gut. Still, some strains (pathotypes) can cause severe infections in humans, usually through food contamination. 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> is one of the most important bacteria in a hospital and community-acquired infections in humans. Fecal–oral transmission is the usual route through which patho-types of the 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> cause disease (
