<p>Essential oils (EOs) are a concentrated mixture of hydrophobic compounds in the oil phase, characterized by a strong odor (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). They are secreted as secondary metabolites from different parts of aromatic plants, such as flowers, fruits, seeds, stems, and roots (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Hydrodistillation using the Clevenger type apparatus is the most common approach for the extraction of EOs (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Recently, a growing number of studies on different medical properties of EOs have been being performed (
