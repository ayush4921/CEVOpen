<p>In the past, antibacterial properties were mainly reported by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) which is described as the lowest concentration of an agent to prevent bacterial visible growth (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). For instance, the MIC of 
 <italic>Artemisia dracunculus</italic> EO on 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> was 62.4 mg.mL
 <sup>–1</sup> (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Besides, 
 <italic>Anethum graveolens</italic> EO showed a good antibacterial effect on 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> with MIC of 2.5 mg.mL
 <sup>–1</sup> (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). However, by developing optical density (OD) dependent technics, the growth of microorganisms was observed as turbidity, determined by analytical instruments (

 <sub>50</sub>) is measurable. This value is defined as observing a 50% decrease in bacterial growth in the treated sample compared to the control group. It is a reliable and quantitative unit with upper and lower confidence limits (
