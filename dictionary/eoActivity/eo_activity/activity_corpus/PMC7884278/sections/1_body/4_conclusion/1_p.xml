<p>Antibacterial activity of six EOs was investigated in a quantitative approach on four important human pathogens. CSEO (IC

 <sup>–1</sup>), CSEO (4.7 mg.mL
 <sup>–1</sup>), and ADEO (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 1.3 mg.mL
 <sup>–1</sup>) were the most effective against 
 <italic>S. aureus, E. coli, P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae,</italic> respectively. These EOs could be used for developing inexpensive, potent, and green antibacterial agents.
