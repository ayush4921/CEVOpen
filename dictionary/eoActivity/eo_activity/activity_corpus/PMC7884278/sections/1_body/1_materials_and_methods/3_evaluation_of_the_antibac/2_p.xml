<p>A serial dilution of each EO was prepared by dissolving in Muller Hinton Broth (containing 0.5% DMSO) in a concentration range of 10.00–0.39 mg.mL
 <sup>–1</sup>. By the addition of 80 µL form serial dilutions to each well, the concentration of EOs eventually fixed at 8.00, 4.00, 2.00, 1.00, 0.50, 0.25, 0.13, 0.06, and 0.03 mg.mL
 <sup>–1</sup>. Three control wells were considered in each plate, filled with 20 and 80 µL of the bacteria suspension and the Muller Hinton Broth (containing DMSO 0.5%). Treated plates were then incubated at 37ºC for 24 h. The turbidity of each well was read at 630 nm by a plate reader (Synergy HTX Multi-Mode Reader, USA), and the growth of bacteria was calculated using
