<p>96-well plate microdilution method was used for determining the growth inhibitory effect of EOs against target bacteria with slight modification (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). New cultured bacterial colonies (overnight culture) were suspended in Muller Hinton broth to reach 1.5 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL to reach the level of 0.5 McFarland turbidity. Then 20 µL of the bacterial suspension was added to each well using an 8-channel pipette.
