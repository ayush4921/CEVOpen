<p>Results of the growth inhibitory effect of CLEO on some bacteria are demonstrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>. With the maximum growth of 14%, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> was more affected after 24 h exposure with CLEO at a concentration of 8.00 mg. mL
 <sup>–1</sup>; observed growth for three other bacteria was ~ 60%. Antibacterial effect (MIC) of CLEO on 
 <italic>E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> was reported previously. These values were 6.4, 12.8, 12.8 and 12.8 mg.mL
 <sup>–1</sup>, respectively (
