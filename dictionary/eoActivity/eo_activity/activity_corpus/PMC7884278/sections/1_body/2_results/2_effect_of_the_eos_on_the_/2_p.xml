 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> shows the antibacterial activity of AGEO at various concentrations. The highest antibacterial activity was achieved at 8.00 against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, with inhibition in 34% growth. However, other bacterial growth was 54, 61, 73% for 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, respectively. Some reports on the MIC of ADEO against many bacteria have been found; For example, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> 1.25 mg.mL
 <sup>–1</sup>, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> 1.5 mg.mL
 <sup>–1</sup>, and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> 0.62 mg.mL
 <sup>–1</sup> (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In another study, the MIC of AGEO on 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> was reported as &gt;10 mg.mL
 <sup>–1</sup> (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).
