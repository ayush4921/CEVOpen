<p>The antibacterial effect of CSEO is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>. Totally, by increasing the concentration of EO, the growth of bacteria was reduced. At the highest level (8.00 mg.mL
 <sup>–1</sup>), the growth of 
 <italic>S. aureus, E. coli, P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> decreased to 13%, 57%, 43% and 35%, respectively. Like the previously mentioned EOs, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> was more susceptible than other examined bacteria. Reviewing the literature, MIC of CSEO against 
 <italic>S. aureus, K. pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> was reported as 0.062, 0.25, and 0.12 mg.mL
 <sup>–1</sup> (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). The related value for 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> was 0.75 mg.mL
 <sup>–1</sup> (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).
