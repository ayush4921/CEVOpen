<p>The cyclodextrin properties, namely the internal hydrophobic cavity and the external hydrophilicity, make it one of the best compounds used for the protection of products with poor solubility, such as EOs [
 <xref rid="B50-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Thus, the complexation of EOs in cyclodextrins ensures their stability, as well as the subsequent controlled release of these compounds. As a result, this procedure is a solution utilized for the protection of many phytochemicals, but the use of cyclodextrins for EO encapsulation is not the purpose of this review. Cyclodextrins are included only due to their multiple uses and importance.
