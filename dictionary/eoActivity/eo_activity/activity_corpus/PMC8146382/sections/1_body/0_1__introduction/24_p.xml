<p>Polymeric nanoencapsulation of EOs through nanoprecipitation techniques recently received tremendous attention. The method is a well-established approach that ensures improved water solubility, effective protection against degradation, prevention of volatile components evaporation, and controlled and targeted release. These benefits were underlined in the review by Lammari [
 <xref rid="B49-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In the article, the method and applicability of the nanotechnology were correlated with the chemical composition of EOs, the principle of polymeric nanoparticle preparation, the physicochemical properties of EOs loaded nanoparticles in relation to their current applications.
