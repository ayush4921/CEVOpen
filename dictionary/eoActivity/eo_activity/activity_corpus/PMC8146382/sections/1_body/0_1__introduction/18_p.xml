<p>In the review by Tomasz M. Karpiński, the antifungal activities of EOs from 72 Lamiaceae plants were presented [
 <xref rid="B45-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The author presented the EOs as alternatives to medicines due to their broad antimicrobial spectrums, in the context of increased incidences of fungal infections, from recent years, and the high frequency of infections caused by drug-resistant strains and new pathogens, e.g., 
 <italic>Candida auris</italic>. The best activity (minimum inhibitory concentrations, MICs &lt; 100) of EOs from some species of the genera 
 <italic>Clinopodium</italic>, 
 <italic>Lavandula</italic>, 
 <italic>Mentha</italic>, 
 <italic>Thymbra</italic>, and 
 <italic>Thymus</italic> was also mentioned. The chemical components most commonly found, as the main ingredients, were β-caryophyllene (41 plants), linalool (27 plants), limonene (26), β-pinene (25), 1,8-cineole (22), carvacrol (21), α-pinene (21), p-cymene (20), γ-terpinene (20), and thymol (20).
