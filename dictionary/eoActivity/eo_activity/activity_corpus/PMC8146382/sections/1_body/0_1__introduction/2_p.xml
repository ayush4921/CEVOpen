<p>The use of EOs in medicine, pharmaceutical sciences, biology, and agronomy dates back to ancient time due to their specific bioactive molecules, composed essentially from flavonoids, isoflavones, aldehydes, terpenoids, phenolic acids, carotenoids, and alkaloids, which provide specific activities, such as antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, cytoprotective, antitumor, anthelmintic, antimicrobial, antihypertensive, analgesic, larvicidal, insecticidal, antiparasitic, and other biological activities. EOs are suitable as complementary medicinal treatments, owing to their pleasantness and availability, and also, to synergistic therapeutic effects with the prescribed medical treatments, e.g., antibiotics [

The reviews are generally intended to present an overview of the antimicrobial properties of EOs, their mechanisms of action, components of EOs, nano-encapsulated EOs, and synergistic combinations of EOs, in order to apply them and overcome multidrug-resistant microorganisms [

 <xref rid="B17-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. They Reviews are also devoted to the elucidation of the mechanisms of action of the oils, the effects of EOs on different microorganisms, or how they work in combination with other antimicrobial compounds.
