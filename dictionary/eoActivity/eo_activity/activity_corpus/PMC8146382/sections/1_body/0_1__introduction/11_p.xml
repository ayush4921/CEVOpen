<p>In a recent review, the use of approximately 90 EOs with at least 1500 combinations for dermatological infections was presented [
 <xref rid="B26-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Their antimicrobial properties were found against pathogens, such as 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>, 
 <italic>Propionibacterium acnes</italic>, 
 <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Brevibacterium</italic> species. The review revealed the possibilities for EOs encapsulation in composites and blends, as well their interactions with conventional antimicrobials for synergic effects. The challenges in this context include finding solutions (i.e., the combination of EOs, oils, and drugs), as well as finding suitable carriers for these compounds.
