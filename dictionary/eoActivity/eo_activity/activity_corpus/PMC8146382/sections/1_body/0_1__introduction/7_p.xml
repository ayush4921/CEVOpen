<p>EOs, as secondary metabolites with a wide range of bioactivities, especially antimicrobial properties, are utilized to treat various human ailments and diseases. The capacity of EOs for cancer cell targeting activity, conferring the ability to increase the efficacy of commonly used chemotherapy drugs (e.g., paclitaxel and docetaxel), and pro-immune functions when administered to cancer patients, was presented in the reviews [
