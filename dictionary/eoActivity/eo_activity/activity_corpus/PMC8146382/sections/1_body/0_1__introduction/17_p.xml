<p>Orchard et al.—concerning EO use against dermatological infections—presented the coupled effect of the carrier oils on antimicrobial activities and cytotoxicity of EOs against skin pathogens [
 <xref rid="B44-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. EOs are rarely utilized undiluted, and the use of an oil carrier as a base for blending is made before applying the EO to the skin to prevent irritation (e.g., contact dermatitis). In Orchard’s article, the positive effects of the oil carrier over cytotoxicity, without antagonizing the EO’s antimicrobial activity, was presented. Thus, the study identified 
 <italic>Aloe vera</italic> and 
 <italic>Schisandra chinensis</italic> as oils carriers that caused the highest reduction of cytotoxicity and increased antimicrobial activity, while 
 <italic>Aloe vera</italic>, 
 <italic>Schisandra chinensis, Hypericum perforatum, Calendula officinalis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Persea americana</italic> were found to increase the antimicrobial activity of several EOs against respective pathogens, including 
 <italic>Brevibacterium epidermidis</italic>, 
 <italic>Brevibacterium. linens</italic>, and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>.
