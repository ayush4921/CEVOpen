<p>The review by Magdalena Valdivieso-Ugarte et al. underlined the use of EOs in clinical studies, including: (i) efficacy against foodborne pathogens, namely the inhibition of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. Albicans</italic>; (ii) antioxidant activities in a dose range of 0.01 to 10 mg/mL in cell models, owing to the presence of the phenolic compounds; and (iii) immune-modulatory activities attributed to their ability to modify the secretion of cytokines [

The authors evidenced the benefits conferred by using EOs, as well as the need to continue investigations to confirm their biological properties, and support activities of EOs for normalization of dose and incubation times in cell and animal models.
