<p>Vaillancourt et al. investigated the synergistic interactions between thyme and winter savory oils, with penicillin G, chlorhexidine, or nisin against penicillin-resistant 
 <italic>S. hyicus</italic> 84-2978 (thyme and winter savory) and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> 25923 (cinnamon, thyme, and winter savory) [
 <xref rid="B19-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The study provided evidence that EOs, namely cinnamon, thyme, and winter savory, may contribute toward developing herbal treatments against exudative epidermitis in piglets. As the researchers presented the therapeutic potential of EOs, used as topical therapeutic agents against exudative epidermitis, may reduce the incidence of the disease and decrease the utilization of antibiotics to treat this infection.
