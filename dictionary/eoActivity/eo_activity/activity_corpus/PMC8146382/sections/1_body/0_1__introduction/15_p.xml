<p>A recent review recommended the nanoparticles (NPs) associated with natural products and phytochemicals as promising platforms for antibiofilm technologies, in connection with studies about antibiofilm compounds, and in relation to the necessity of obtaining these new materials [
 <xref rid="B38-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The article justified applicability of NPs due to the antimicrobial activities of EOs, of their extracts or isolated compounds, when they can be found on the surfaces of NPs, encapsulated, or combined in formulations, such as nanoemulsions. In this context, the ability of oils to produce microemulsions and nanoemulsions that show availability alongside antimicrobial activities of being drug delivery vehicles should also be mentioned.
