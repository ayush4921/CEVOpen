<p>Another systematic analysis of the current research on lemongrass, lavender, clove, dill, and other EOs related to their anti-convulsing activities, which can be beneficial for people with epilepsy, as recently reviewed by Bahr et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The authors mentioned the main constituents responsible for these beneficial effects, such as as asarone, carvone, citral, eugenol, and linalool compounds, while the internal use of sage, hyssop, rosemary, camphor, pennyroyal, eucalyptus, cedar, thuja, and fennel oil have effects on epileptic seizures due to the presence of thujone, 1,8-cineole, camphor, or pino-camphone, which have been identified as convulsive agents. Concerning the mechanisms of action, the authors attributed (to oils) the ability to modulate the GABAergic system of neurotransmission, and alter the ionic currents through ion channels.
