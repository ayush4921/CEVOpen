<p>Numerous articles have reviewed the potential of using EOs due to their multiple and various phyto-constituents, that stand out for the complexity of oils compositions, as well as by their large number of biological activities and effects able to generate [

 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>) of carvacrol, cinnamaldehyde, and thymol, developed through a bactericidal mechanism identified by membrane disruption. EO presence in concentrations above 0.5 mg/mL hinders 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilm formation and elimination of the preformed biofilms. The sub-cytotoxic values (0.015–0.090 mg/mL) are lower than minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations for bacteria, but much higher than chlorhexidine doses (0.004 mg/mL). At the same time, the minimum bactericidal concentrations would only be three orders of magnitude higher than the sub-cytotoxic dose.
