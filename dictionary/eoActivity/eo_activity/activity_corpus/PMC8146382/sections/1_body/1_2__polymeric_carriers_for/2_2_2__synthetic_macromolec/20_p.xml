<p>Recently, a biobased compound, namely poly(ethylene brassylate-co-squaric acid), synthesized through the ethylene brassylate macrolactone ring-opening and copolymerization with squaric acid, was used for the encapsulation of thymol, a natural monoterpenoid phenol found in thyme oil, a compound with strong antiseptic properties [
 <xref rid="B165-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>]. The antimicrobial activity of poly(ethylene brassylate-co-squaric acid) thymol complex was investigated against eight different reference strains namely: bacterial strainsâ€”
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC25923, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ATCC25922, 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> ATCC 29212, 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> ATCC 10031 and 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> ATCC 14028, yeast strains represented by 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> ATCC10231 and 
 <italic>Candida glabrata</italic> ATCC 2001, and the fungal strain 
 <italic>Aspergillus brasiliensis</italic> ATCC9642.
