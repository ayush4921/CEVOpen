<p>A natural/synthetic polymer system based on sodium alginate and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) incorporated with cinnamon, clove, or lavender oils was tested by the electrospinning procedure for the manufacture of antibacterial nanoscale fibers [
 <xref rid="B81-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. The study was performed, as both polymers have excellent biocompatible properties, while the investigated EOs have the desired antibacterial properties. The research study confirmed the increase of the polymer solution viscosity after EO incorporation, as well as good antibacterial properties against
