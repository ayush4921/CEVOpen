<p>Thyme and carvacrol EOs were embedded in CS nanoparticles by nanoprecipitation procedure from acetic acid, or in nanocapsules prepared through a solvent displacement technique [
 <xref rid="B103-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. The kinetics of the release of thyme EO in aqueous medium from the prepared CS nanostructures were evaluated. The inhibitory activity assess for future applications as an antibacterial agent of the compound was put into evidence, and shows a higher inhibitory activity for nanoparticles than for nanocapsules when tested against six foodborne bacteria (the highest against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> in case of nanoparticles, and highest against 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> in case of nanocapsules). At the same time, thymol and carvacrol, presented faster release time from nanoparticles than from nanocapsules.
