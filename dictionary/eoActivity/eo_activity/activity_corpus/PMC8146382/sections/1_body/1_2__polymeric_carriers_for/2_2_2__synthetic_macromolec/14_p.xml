<p>Electrospinning as feasible nanotechnology was used for poly(acrylonitrile) (PAN) nano-fibrous mats preparation with entrapped lavender oil [
 <xref rid="B157-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>]. During the electrospinning process the incorporation of an electrolytic solution of 0.3% (
 <italic>w/w</italic>) NaCl to the polymer solution led to obtaining a reduced average fiber diameter (88.44 nm), with a narrow degree of polydispersity, and enhancement of the fiber morphology, which improved the probability of incorporating therapeutic oils into nanofibers. The prepared PAN composite nanofibers were recommended for use in various fields, such as biomedical, textile and water treatment applications, owing to their proven antibacterial characteristics against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> bacteria. PAN nanofibers presented good biocompatibility and non-cytotoxic nature tested on mouse fibroblasts.
