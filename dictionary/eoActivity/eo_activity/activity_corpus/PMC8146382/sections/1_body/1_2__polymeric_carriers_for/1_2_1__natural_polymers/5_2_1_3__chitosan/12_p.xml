<p>The new method used for encapsulation based on emulsionâ€“ionic gelation crosslinking, constitutes a promising technique for the entrapment of bioactive compounds, which does not require heat application or the use of toxic crosslinking agents and generates stable nanosized particles. This two-step method was used in a research study for the fabrication of carvacrol-loaded CS nanoparticles [
 <xref rid="B110-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. Thus, the oil-in water emulsion of CS followed by ionic gelation in the presence of TPP led to preparation of particles able for encapsulation of carvacrol in a content of 0.25 up to 1.25 g/g of CS. The carvacrol-loaded CS nanoparticles were tested from the viewpoint of their antimicrobial activity against
