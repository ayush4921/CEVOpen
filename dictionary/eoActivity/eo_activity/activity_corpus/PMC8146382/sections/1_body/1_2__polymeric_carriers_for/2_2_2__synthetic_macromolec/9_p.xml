<p>In a study by Mori et al., various concentrations of Candeia (
 <italic>Eremanthus erythropappus</italic>) oil were incorporated into PLA, and the nanofibrous mats were produced by the electrospinning procedure [
 <xref rid="B152-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]. The oil addition increased the nanofiber diameter, while the homogeneous structure of the new prepared nanostructured mats was evidenced by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The plasticizer effect of Candeia was confirmed by the decreased values of the glass transition temperature and melting point corresponding to the new PLA composite, and was attributed to the presence of alpha-bisabolol as main terpene compound in oil. The prepared nanofibers demonstrated antibacterial and hydrophobic characters, and were recommended by authors for applications in controlled release of drugs.
