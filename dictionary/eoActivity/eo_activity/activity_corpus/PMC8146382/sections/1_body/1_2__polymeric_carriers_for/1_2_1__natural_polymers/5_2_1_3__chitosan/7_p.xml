<p>CS as a natural and biodegradable cationic polysaccharide with efficient antimicrobial action, together with PVA, were used to form a film embedded with cinnamon leaf and clove oils that display, as well, strong antimicrobial activity, especially against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B106-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. The prepared CS/PVA films embedded with cinnamon leaf or clove oils demonstrated to be mechanically fit according to the investigation, presented efficient bactericidal effects after 2 h of direct contact in the infected microenvironments, and evidenced improved antimicrobial character compared with the unloaded films.
