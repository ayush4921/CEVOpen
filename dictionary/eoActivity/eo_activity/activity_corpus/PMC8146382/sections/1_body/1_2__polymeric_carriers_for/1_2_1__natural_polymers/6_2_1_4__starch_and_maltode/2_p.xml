<p>Chemically modified MD has been investigated for the microencapsulation of avocado EO, owing to its capacity to protect bioactive compounds [
 <xref rid="B122-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. MD modified with octenylsuccinic anhydride presented a degree of substitution of 0.020, and an improved emulsification capacity compared to its non-modified counterpart. The microencapsulation capacity of the modified MD was tested with avocado EO by the spray drying technique. The modified MD confirmed its potential for EO protection through an increased stability put into evidence by the reduction of about 60% of the peroxide index relative to MD alone.
