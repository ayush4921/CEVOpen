<p>Among the tested EOs, the emulsified 
 <italic>Brucea javanica</italic> oil, which has been used in treating different kinds of malignant tumors, was investigated, as well as the 
 <italic>Brucea javanica</italic> oil emulsion variant, enriched with brusatol, using soybean lecithin surfactant, for testing their effects against hepatoma 22 (H22) in mice [
 <xref rid="B97-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. The investigation was conducted based on previous studies concerning 
 <italic>Brucea javanica</italic> that demonstrated the antitumoral, antimalarial, and anti-inflammatory properties of EO, including its use in the treatment of lung and gastrointestinal cancers. The antitumor components were tetracyclic triterpene quassinoids, with poor water solubility and low bioavailability, which necessitated increased investigations, to increase the clinical applications and proper networks for encapsulation [
 <xref rid="B98-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. The study by Tongtong Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B97-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>] confirmed brusatol, a characteristic quassinoid, as the major category of anticancer phytochemicals of 
 <italic>Brucea javanica</italic>. The compound exhibited pronounced anti-hepatocellular carcinoma (anti-HCC) activity confirmed by suppressing the growth of implanted hepatoma H22 in mice, ascending weight, abdominal circumference, ascites volume, and cancer cell viability, while the anti-HCC effect was associated with the activation of miRNA-29b, p53-associated apoptosis and mitochondrial-related pathways.
