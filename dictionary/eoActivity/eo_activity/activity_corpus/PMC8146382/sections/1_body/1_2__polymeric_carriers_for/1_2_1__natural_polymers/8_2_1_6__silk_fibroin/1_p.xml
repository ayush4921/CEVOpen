<p>In another investigation, the electrospinning technique was used to obtain an electrospun asymmetric membrane composed of two interconnected layers designated for enhancing healing processes [
 <xref rid="B136-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. The top layer was composed of silk fibroin and polycaprolactone (PCL), while the bottom layer was produced by using a blend of silk fibroin with hyaluronic acid. Silk fibroin was chosen as it presents excellent biocompatibility, good water vapor permeability, biodegradability, mechanical strength, and minimal inflammatory reaction [
 <xref rid="B137-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>], while PCL was selected owing to its hydrophobic character and high mechanical strength [

It was intended that both compounds to generate an epidermis-like layer presenting hydrophobic character, waterproof ability, and mechanical resistance. The researchers have also chosen hydrophilic hyaluronic acid as it provides high capacity of hydration, water-sorption and water retention, allowing cell attachment, migration, and proliferation [

 <xref rid="B140-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. The resulting data highlighted the epidermis-like structure of the new generated “sandwich”, which was capable of absorbing the wound exudate and also promote cell adhesion and proliferation. The antimicrobial activity of the bottom layer was attributed to the thymol EO loaded into the nanofibers mesh.
