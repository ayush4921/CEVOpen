<p>For example, PCL and PLA, as well their 50/50 polymeric systems were used for mats preparation by electrospinning technique [
 <xref rid="B145-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>]. Thymol, in concentration of 1.2% 
 <italic>v/v</italic>, was embedded in the obtained nanofibers, and the prepared compounds were tested for wound dressings. In the process of electrospinning, the researchers used PCL (12% 
 <italic>w/v</italic>) and PLA (3% 
 <italic>w/v</italic>) in chloroform/dimethylformamide solution in ratio of 7:3. The antibacterial evaluation of the 50/50 PCL/PLA hybrid nanofibrous samples containing thymol showed satisfactory effects on 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> compared to 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> bacteria during treatment periods. In vivo wound-healing in rats and the histological performance observations of the nanofibrous mats made of 50/50 PCL/PLA loaded with thymol revealed a wound-closure percentage of about 92.5% after a period of 14 days.
