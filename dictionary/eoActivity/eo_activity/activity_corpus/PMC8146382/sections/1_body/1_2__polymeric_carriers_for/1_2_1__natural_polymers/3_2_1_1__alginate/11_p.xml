<p>Another crosslinked oil-sphere complex system, based on calcium-aluminum-alginate-pectinate encapsulated with 
 <italic>Mentha piperita</italic>, was investigated for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome [
 <xref rid="B82-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. The study put into evidence the dependence of the physicochemical and textural properties of the prepared complex on the concentration between polymers, crosslinkers, and crosslinking reaction times. Moreover, the resulted kinetic modeling data indicated the diffusion process as the predominant release mechanism of the encapsulated oil, at the same time as modulating the diffusion through the application of a novel fusion coating procedure. The researchers used the artificial neural network as an alternative tool to predict the response values of the dependent variables, and concluded that this approach is very attractive when employing statistical strategies for formulation development. Thus, the Plackett–Burman design was employed to develop and optimize the new crosslinked calcium–aluminum–alginate–pectinate oil sphere complex for the in vitro site–specific release of 
 <italic>Mentha piperita</italic>. The encapsulation of oil ranged from 6 to 35 mg/100 mg oil spheres.
