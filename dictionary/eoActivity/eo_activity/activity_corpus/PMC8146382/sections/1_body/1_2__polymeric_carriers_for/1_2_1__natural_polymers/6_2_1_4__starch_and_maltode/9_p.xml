<p>The encapsulation of thymol in the potato-starch–polysorbate–glycerol–citric acid complex dispersion and related cast films was demonstrated [
 <xref rid="B134-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. The results proved the antioxidant and antimicrobial capacity of potato starch dispersions enriched with polysorbate-thymol micelles, only in the presence of polysorbate-thymol micelles, but with lower levels than polysorbate–thymol alone. It was concluded on the necessity to evaluate the biocompatibility of these materials.
