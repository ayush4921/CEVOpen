<p>Reports concerning the antitumor activities of 
 <italic>Rosemary</italic> (
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis L</italic>.) registered both in vitro and in animal studies, as reviewed in the article by Gonzalez-Vallinas et al. [
 <xref rid="B94-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. If initially, the antitumor effects of rosemary were attributed to its antioxidant activity, the contemporary studies present different molecular mechanisms related to rosemary tumor inhibitory properties, for example, the diterpenes from rosemary interact with the cell signaling machinery of cancer cells leading to decreased cell viability and proliferation [
 <xref rid="B95-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Thus, the review summarizes the anticancer effects of rosemary developed through molecular mechanisms, as well as the interactions between rosemary and currently used anticancer agents, underlining the possibility to use rosemary extract as a complementary agent in cancer therapy in comparison with its isolated components. The pharmacokinetic properties of diterpenes from rosemary suggest they are well absorbed and can achieve plasma concentrations that are physiologically relevant, while the phenolic components of rosemary possess anti-invasive and anti-metastatic activity.
