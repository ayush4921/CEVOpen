<p>Arabic gum, MD, and modified starch system was used to encapsulate oregano EO by spray drying after preparation of the oil-in-water emulsions [
 <xref rid="B125-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. The polysaccharides functioned as emulsion and EO stabilizers, and also as tablet binders. The spray drying procedure gave a powdered product with various content of oil. The transformation in tablet of the powdered product was made by addition of (1) croscarmellose sodium that contributed at the increasing of the release rate of EO from tablets, or (2) sodium starch glycolate having small effects on the release process. The tablets with oregano oil showed antimicrobial activity comparable with the non-encapsulated EO form. The authors of study recommended the tablet formulation as a promising dosage form for oral delivery of EO providing an accurate dose that can be delivered in a convenient way.
