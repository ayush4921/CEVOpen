<p>SPI, a partner of alginate, in the previous reference, was investigated for nanocomposites film preparation with sodium montmorillonite clays that incorporated eugenol to obtain antimicrobial composite films [
 <xref rid="B56-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The study evidenced the interactions between eugenol and clay with the modification of film properties, for example, the increase of the glass transition temperature of the films. The retention of eugenol in SPI films was favored by the clay presence, while the release was slowed.
