<p>A review concerning PLA-based antimicrobial materials was recently published [
 <xref rid="B154-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>]. The article underlined the physicochemical properties of PLA as renewability, biodegradability, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for clinical use, which recommends this compound as promising system to control microbial growth. The possibilities for the development of antimicrobial PLA materials as delivery systems, coatings for biomedical devices, efficient stabilizers-carriers of various kinds of antimicrobial additives including EOs, and other natural compounds, active particles, nanoparticles, and conventional and synthetic molecules, were also mentioned.
