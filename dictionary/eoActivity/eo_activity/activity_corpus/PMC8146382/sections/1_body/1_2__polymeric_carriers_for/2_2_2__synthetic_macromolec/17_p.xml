<p>Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) membranes with dual porosity were prepared through a technique mimicking polypore fungi obtained by non-solvent-induced phase separation [
 <xref rid="B161-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>]. The membranes were further charged with tea tree EO, to confer antimicrobial properties. The study recommended PVDF membranes, with easily tuned asymmetric channel-like porosity and controlled pore size, as ideal candidates for drug delivery applications. The new system presented the possibility to store controlled amount of bioactive component within the membrane porosity, and limited loss of the EO. The antimicrobial properties of PVDF membranes loaded with tea tree EO were tested against 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, as model microorganisms, and they showed antibacterial activity against both of them. In addition, the PVDF membranes embedding tea tree EO showed good cytocompatibility on mouse mesenchymal cells (C3HIOT1) and mouse myoblasts (C2C12).
