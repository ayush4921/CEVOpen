<p>The antioxidant and free radical scavenging activity and the antihypertensive effect of the aqueous 
 <italic>Thymus serpyllum L</italic>. extract was proved by in vitro investigations [
 <xref rid="B101-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Thyme polyphenols, obtained by diffusion from an external aqueous solution of 
 <italic>Thymus serpyllum L</italic>., were encapsulated into CS microbeads crosslinked by the emulsion technique [
 <xref rid="B102-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. The conditions of loading by swelling of dry microbeads in the accommodated acidic medium were correlated with the concentrations of chitosan (1.5–3% (
 <italic>w/v</italic>)) and the crosslinking agent, namely glutaraldehyde (0.1–0.4% (
 <italic>v/v</italic>). The encapsulated thyme polyphenols had a rate of release in simulated gastrointestinal fluids prolonged with 3 h, and the new system has the potential to be used as a functional food additive.
