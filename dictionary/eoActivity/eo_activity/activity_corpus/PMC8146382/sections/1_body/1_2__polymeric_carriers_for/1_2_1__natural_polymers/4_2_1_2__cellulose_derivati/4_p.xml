<p>Another cellulose derivative, in which some hydroxyl groups present on the glucose moiety were modified into ethyl ether groups, namely, ethyl cellulose was used for Babchi EO encapsulation due to the non-swellable and hydrophobic character of the EO [
 <xref rid="B87-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Babchi EO possess a variety of biological activities, such as antitumor, anti-inflammatory, immune-modulatory, antioxidant, antifungal, antimicrobial, and antibacterial properties, which recommend its use for the treatment of dermatological disorders. Due to its highly viscous nature and poor stability in the presence of light, air, and high temperature, its practical applications are very limited. In the mentioned study, Babchi EO was encapsulated in the ethyl cellulose matrix through a quasi-emulsion solvent evaporation technique by using PVA as stabilizer and dichloromethane as solvent. The in vitro cytotoxicity revealed the prepared microsponges as safer products on dermal cells, with antimicrobial activity against dermal bacteria like
