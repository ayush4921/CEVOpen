<p>Among these derivatives, cellulose acetate presents biocompatibility, absence of toxicity, has biodegradability, and has recently been used for the incorporation of lemongrass oil via the solvent/anti-solvent method, to prepare antimicrobial nanocapsules (NCs) [
 <xref rid="B85-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. The new system prepared and investigated by Liakos et al., demonstrated exceptional antimicrobial properties due to lemongrass oil, characteristics that recommend the compound as a pharmaceutical agent for biomedical applications. The resulting nanocapsules diameter was tailored between 95 and 185 nm, which bio-adhered well to mucous membranes, and presented very good antimicrobial properties at low concentrations against 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. An important aspect of this new structure is the absence of surfactants during nanocapsules preparation, which makes the resulting NCs fully natural. The formation of the chemical bonding between lemongrass and the cellulose acetate ring with hemiacetal structure formation, which ensured the stability of the lemongrass oil molecules in the aquatic environment for more than 6 months, was also demonstrated.
