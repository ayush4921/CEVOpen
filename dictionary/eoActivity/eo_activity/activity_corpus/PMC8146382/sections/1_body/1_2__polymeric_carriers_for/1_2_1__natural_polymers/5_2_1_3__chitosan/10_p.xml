<p>The resulted nanoparticles were characterized and a loading capacity of about 22.2% for peppermint oil, and respectively 23.1% for green tea oil, was revealed. The new nano-encapsulated particles presented an increased thermal stability, as well as antioxidant activity by ~2 and 2.4-fold for peppermint oil and green tea oil respectively. In addition, the antibacterial activity of CS/green tea oil NPs was more efficient than CS/peppermint oil NPs especially against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> with ~9.4 folds improvement compared to pure green tea oil, and ~4.7 fold against 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>.
