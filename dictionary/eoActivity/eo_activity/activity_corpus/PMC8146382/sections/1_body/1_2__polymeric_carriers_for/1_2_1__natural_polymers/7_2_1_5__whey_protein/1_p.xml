<p>Another direction where the antimicrobian character of EOs has found applicability is against fungal metabolites that frequently co-occur in foodstuffs and are responsible for mycotoxicosis and several primary cancers. In this context, a study was devoted to the use of cinnamon EO as emulsion droplets encapsulated in whey protein as wall material, for the protection against oxidative stress, cytotoxicity, and reproductive toxicity in male Sprague-Dawley rats subchronically exposed to Fumonisin B1 (FB1) and/or aflatoxin B1 [
 <xref rid="B135-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. In the wall material, which was constituted from whey protein concentrate (10% in water), it was encapsulated cinnamon EO in a ratio of 1:4 (wall/core material) by stirring and homogenization by ultrasonication, and further the prepared emulsion was spray dried. The analyses performed onto the prepared dispersion evidenced an average size of 235 ± 1.4 nm and zeta potential of −6.24 ± 0.56, while the GC–MS analysis revealed the presence of cinnamaldehyde, α-copaene, trans-cinnamaldehyde, caryophyllene, and delta-cadinene, which are the main compounds of cinnamon essential oil. The investigation proved that the prepared dispersion did not induce toxic effects. Moreover, it could normalize the majority of the tested parameters and improve the histological data obtained from in vivo tests. These effects were attributed to the antioxidant effect of the dispersion containing cinnamon EO in synergy with the whey protein concentrate antioxidant effect, as well as to cinnamon EO dispersion ability to enhance the gut microflora growth, determine the adsorption of both mycotoxins and decrease their bioavailability.
