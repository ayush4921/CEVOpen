<p>Another research study investigated the encapsulation of green tea flavan-3-ols and caffeine in large and hard particles, prepared from alginate with soy or hemp protein systems, and in spherical and softer particles based on whey proteins and bovine serum albumin [
 <xref rid="B73-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. The highest content of polyphenols and caffeine was retained by the combinations of the alginate and calcium caseinate or whey proteins. The release studies, in water and simulated gastric/intestinal fluids, revealed burst release of polyphenols in the first 5â€“10 min followed by sustained release up to 120 min.
