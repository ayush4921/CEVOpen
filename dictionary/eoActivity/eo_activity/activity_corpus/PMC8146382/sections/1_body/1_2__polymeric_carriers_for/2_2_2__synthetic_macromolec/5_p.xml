<p>Nanofibrous membranes, as highly soft materials with high surface-to-volume ratios based on PCL/PVP system, were prepared to be used as carriers for therapeutic agents with antibacterial properties to accelerate wound healing [
 <xref rid="B147-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. Crude bark extract of 
 <italic>Tecomella undulata</italic>, a medicinal plant known for its ability in medical applications for wound healing, was added to a polymer solution in chloroform/methanol (4:1) mixture, made of PCL (which offers strength to the matrices) and PVP (which constitutes the drug delivery medium). The new system was subjected to the process of electrospinning and the resulted nanofibrous membranes were tested against standard strains of 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> MTCC 2297, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC 933, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (IP-406006). The investigation confirmed the ability of the new PCL/PVP nanofiber mats to inhibit the growth of the bacterial strains, indicating also the potential of the system for use as a wound dressing.
