 <xref rid="B71-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. In recent study, researchers investigated the possibility of developing a multifunctional dressing, capable of both protecting the wound from external agents, and promoting the regeneration of new tissue [
 <xref rid="B72-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. In order to obtain bioactive nanofibrous dressings by the electrospinning procedure, the researchers combined two naturally derived compounds, namely sodium alginate and lavender EO. The solution was made from sodium alginate, polyethylene oxide, Pluronic F127, and lavender oil to obtain an emulsion ready for the electrospinning process. The in vitro and in vivo investigations performed on the obtained nanofibrous dressings proved their antibacterial activity against
