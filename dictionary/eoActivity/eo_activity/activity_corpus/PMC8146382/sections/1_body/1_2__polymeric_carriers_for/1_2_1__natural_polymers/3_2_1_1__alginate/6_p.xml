<p>An alginate/cashew gum system was prepared via spray drying for developing biopolymer nanoparticles blends for encapsulation of EOs [
 <xref rid="B64-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. The study utilized alginate as a polyanionic linear biopolymer consisting of β-D-manuronic acid and α-L-guluronic acid, which was able to interact with divalent cations crosslinking agents to form the so-called “egg-box” complexes for coupling various EOs [

 <xref rid="B69-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. In the presented procedure, in the solution containing alginate and cashew gum, Lippia sidoides oil and Tween 80 as an emulsifier were slowly added. The prepared emulsion was crosslinked with CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> solution under mechanical stirring at 18,000 rpm, and then spray dried. The characterized nanoparticles presented an average size in the range of 223–399 nm, and zeta potential values ranged from −30 to −36 mV, attesting excellent stability. EO content varied from 1.9 to 4.4% with an encapsulation efficiency of up to 55%. The in vitro release profile of EO was between 45 and 95% within 30–50 h, exhibiting activity against the larvae of the dengue vector
