<p>Cellulose acetate was investigated as a carrier for the controlled release of thymol, a natural substance with strong antibacterial properties [
 <xref rid="B86-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. The impregnation of thymol was realized by using high-pressure techniques, and the thymol presence was confirmed by various techniques. For the determination of the release kinetic of thymol, simulated gastric and intestinal fluids were used, and the results were correlated with Korsmeyerâ€“Peppas and Weibull models. The new products showed antibacterial activity against 23 tested bacterial strains, including methicillin-resistant
