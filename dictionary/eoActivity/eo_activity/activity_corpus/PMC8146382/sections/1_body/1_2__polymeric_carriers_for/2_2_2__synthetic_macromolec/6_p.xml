<p>PCL was used as well in tandem with PVA in a coaxial electrospun procedure for the fabrication of core–shell nanofibers incorporated with thyme extract [
 <xref rid="B148-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. The effect of operational parameters for the preparation of the nanofibers was presented in order to obtain nanofibers with uniform surface morphology and acceptable tensile strength. It was also investigated and confirmed the biocompatible character of the nanofibers after thyme encapsulation, whereas the antibacterial activity was validated against two bacteria—gram-positive, namely 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and gram-negative 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, for an encapsulation of 5% (
 <italic>w/v</italic>) thyme extract. The potential of the new core–shell PCL/PVA nanofibers for wound healing and for the treatment of surfaces that contain pathogenic microorganisms was proved as well.
