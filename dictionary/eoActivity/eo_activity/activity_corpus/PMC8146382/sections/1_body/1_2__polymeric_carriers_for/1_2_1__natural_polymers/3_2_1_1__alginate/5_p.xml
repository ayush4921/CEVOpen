<p>A more applied article refers to the ability to encapsulate EOs in alginate beads, by using the electrostatic extrusion technique, while retaining their antioxidant potential [
 <xref rid="B63-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The study evaluated the chemical composition and antioxidant potential of lavender (
 <italic>Lavandula angustifolia</italic>), tea tree (
 <italic>Melaleuca alternifolia</italic>), bergamot (
 <italic>Citrus bergamia</italic>) and peppermint (
 <italic>Mentha piperita</italic>) EOs by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), and 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) methods, and their antimicrobial activities. It was revealed that lavender and bergamot EOs were more efficient in inhibiting bacterial growth than other tested oils, with the minimum inhibitory concentration of 5 μg/mL.
