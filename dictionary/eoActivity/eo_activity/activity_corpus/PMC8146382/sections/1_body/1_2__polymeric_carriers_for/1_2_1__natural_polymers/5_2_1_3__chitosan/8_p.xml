<p>An emulsion-ionic gelation procedure of CS crosslinked with pentasodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) or sodium hexametaphosphate (HMP), as crosslinkers, was investigated. The resulted CS nanoparticles were loaded with 
 <italic>Carum copticum</italic> EO [
 <xref rid="B107-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. From the investigation, it was concluded that the encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity of 
 <italic>Carum copticum</italic> EO in CS nanoparticles increased with the increase of the oil amount. Moreover, concerning the obtained nanoparticles, they were spherical in shape and with a regular distribution, while the in vitro release profiles exhibited an initial burst release of the oil followed by a sustained release at different pH conditions, respectively.
