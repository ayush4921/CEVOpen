<p>PLA, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and PLA/PMMA blends were investigated for use as matrix loaded with EOs via the solvent evaporation technique [
 <xref rid="B156-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>]. The obtained polymeric microspheres, with average size between 1.5 to 9.5 mm, were loaded with linalool, 4-allylanisole, and trans-anethole. The highest encapsulation was registered in systems consisting of linalool, namely 81.10 ± 10.0 wt. % for PLA system, and 76.0 ± 3.3 wt. % for PMMA system, while the release rate of EOs from the microspheres was affected by the system size. The composite microspheres were tested for antibacterial activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial strains, and exhibited inhibitory effects against
