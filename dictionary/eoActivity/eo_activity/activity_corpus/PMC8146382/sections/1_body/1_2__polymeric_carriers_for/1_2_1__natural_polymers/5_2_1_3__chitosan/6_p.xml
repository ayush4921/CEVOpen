 <xref rid="B105-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. In this research study, the investigated EO, which is an effective antimicrobial agent, followed a Fickian behavior regarding the release mechanism from β-CD/CS nanoparticles, while the analysis of its in vitro release showed a sustained and controlled release for over 120 h. It was concluded that the as-synthesized β-cyclodextrin/chitosan nanoparticles are promising systems for enhancing the therapeutic effect of the
