<p>Self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system (SNEDDS) formulations in water, based on 
 <italic>Piper cubeba</italic> EO and synthetic and nontoxic components, namely Sefsol-218 (a propylene glycol caprylate), Triton-X100 (a nonionic surfactant that has a hydrophilic polyethylene oxide chain and an aromatic hydrocarbon lipophilic or hydrophobic group), Transcutol-HP (a hydrophilic co-surfactant), were prepared [

 <xref rid="B160-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>]. The prepared systems were investigated for wound healing potential in rats in comparison with pure 
 <italic>Piper cubeba</italic> oil and standard gentamycin. In this study was proposed a combination between 
 <italic>Piper cubeba</italic> and gentamicin, the formulation prepared for synergic effects. The investigation proved that SNEDDS use presents significant enhancement in collagen content but no signs of inflammatory cells. The inhibition of the bacterial infection was attributed to the 
 <italic>Piper cubeba</italic> EO contribution and it was considered the most efficient method to stimulate wound healing.
