<p>The two-step procedure of oil-in-water emulsion preparation followed by the ionic gelation of CS with TPP was also used for oregano EO encapsulation in the polysaccharide nanoparticles [
 <xref rid="B116-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. The EO encapsulation was confirmed by specific spectrophotometric and thermogravimetric analysis. The EE and LC of oregano EO loaded in CS nanoparticles were found around 21–47%, and 3–8%, respectively, corresponding at an initial EO content of 0.1–0.8 g/g CS. The performed in vitro release studies indicated an initial burst effect followed by a slow release of EO.
