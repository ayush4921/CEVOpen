<p>Even if they are not part of this special category of the polymers, we must also mention nanostructured lipid carriers as biocompatible and non-toxic systems. They are well known for the use in the pharmaceutical field due to their enhanced drug loading capacity and targeting efficiency with the possibility of site-specific delivery, drug release modulation flexibility, and improved stability [

 <xref rid="B169-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>]. The used NLC prepared from specific non-ionic surfactant systems were produced by phase inversion temperature (PIT) and high-pressure homogenization (HPH). According to the in vitro results, it was concluded on the enhancement of the biocompatibility and reduction of the cytotoxicity of the pure oils structured in the new complex state.
