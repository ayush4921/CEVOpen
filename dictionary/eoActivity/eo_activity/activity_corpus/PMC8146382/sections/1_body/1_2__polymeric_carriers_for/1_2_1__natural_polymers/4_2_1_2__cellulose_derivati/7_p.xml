<p>The same polymeric system and electrospinning technique were used to valorize and test the antimicrobial properties of rosemary and oregano oils [
 <xref rid="B90-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. The prepared electrospun fibers, based on cellulose acetate and various content of EOs, proved to have good antimicrobial properties against the bacteria species 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, and the yeast 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>. Among the selected EOs, the electrospun fibers prepared with oregano oil showed the best antimicrobial and anti-biofilm effects due to the potency of this oil against bacteria and fungi, especially for
