<p>As already mentioned, the electrospinning nanofabrication is a very useful technique for EOs encapsulation in a suitable polymer carrier as it does not require the use of coagulation chemistry or high temperatures to produce solid threads from solution. As a result, many research studies were conducted for the encapsulation of EOs in polymeric electrospun fibers to create functional membranes for biomedical and food packaging applications. Additionally, these studies underlined the preservation of the bioactivity of EOs after mixing with various polymer systems and processing by electrospinning. Moreover, the EOs released from the products obtained through the electrospinning process still presented the characteristics of the inserted EOs, namely antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activity [
