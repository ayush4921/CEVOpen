<p>Solutions based on CS and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) were incorporated with cinnamon-aldehyde, a volatile EO that eradicates pathogens non-specifically [
 <xref rid="B118-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. The obtained solutions were electrospun into mats with ~50 nm fiber diameters. Cytotoxicity studies have proven intrinsic antibacterial activity and quick release of cinnamonâ€“aldehyde, and enabled high inactivation rates against
