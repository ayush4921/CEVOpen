<p>Liakos et al. reported the use of EOs as natural antimicrobial agents for the preparation of cellulose-based fibrous dressings. They produced composite electrospun fibers for encapsulation of cinnamon, lemongrass, and peppermint oils, and demonstrated the capacity of the fibers to inhibit the growth of 
 <italic>Escherichia coli.</italic> It was also proved from assays on skin cell models that the fibers are biocompatible and not cytotoxic [
 <xref rid="B89-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. The fabrication of the fibrous mats by electrospinning necessitates specific conditions to obtain mats with thickness of about 0.2 mm. The presence of the EOs in fibers was proved by Raman spectroscopy, while the antibacterial and the efficacy of the fibers was tested and confirmed against 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, resulting in a complete inhibition of bacteria growth. The biocompatibility assays performed on two different cell lines (fibroblasts and human keratinocytes) revealed the non-cytotoxicity of the scaffolds.
