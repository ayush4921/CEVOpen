 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> Linn., 
 <italic>Tetranychus urticae</italic> Koch., and 
 <italic>Cerataphis lataniae</italic> Boisd. The investigation proved an encapsulation efficiency of the oils up to 1000 μg × mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, while their controlled release was described by the anomalous mechanism of Korsmeyer–Peppas.
