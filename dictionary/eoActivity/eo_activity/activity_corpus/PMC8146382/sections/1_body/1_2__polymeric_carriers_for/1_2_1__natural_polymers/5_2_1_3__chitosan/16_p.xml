<p>Electrospun nanofibrous membranes, which present high surface area to volume ratio, porosity, and structural similarities with the skin extracellular matrix, meet the requirements for wound dressingâ€™s applications. As shown in the article written by Miguel et al., an ideal wound dressing must confer protection against external microorganisms, chemical, and physical aggressions, and to promote healing process by stimulating the cell adhesion, differentiation, and proliferation, and the nanofibers incorporated with EOs bioactive molecules, correspond to these requests [
