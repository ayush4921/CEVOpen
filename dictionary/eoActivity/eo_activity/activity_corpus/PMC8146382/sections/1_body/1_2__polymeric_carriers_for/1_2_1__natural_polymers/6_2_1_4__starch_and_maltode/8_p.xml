<p>A recent study investigated the preparation of composite films based on sago starch, guar gum, and whey protein isolate with antimicrobial properties due to incorporation of carvacrol, and citral, as well as EOs combination, in order to be used for the prophylaxis of the bacterial gastroenteritis [
 <xref rid="B133-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. The oils droplets were uniform distributed within the biopolymeric network, and all films containing EOs demonstrated good antibacterial potency against the bacterial gastroenteritis model causing bacteria, namely,
