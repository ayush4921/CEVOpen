<p>The anti-inflammatory ability and wound-healing properties of lavender oil are well known, and Burhan et al. used this oil in their study and made a correlation between polymer content, oil loading, and the ratio between gum acacia and MD polymeric matrix. The conditions for microparticles preparation were reflected in their particle size, yield, loading, and encapsulation efficiency of composites. It was found that the lavender microparticles with a size of 12.42 Â± 1.79 mm were prepared at 30 
 <italic>w/w</italic>% polymer concentration, giving a 16.67 
 <italic>w/w</italic>% oil loading, while the 25 
 <italic>w/w</italic>% gum acacia showed maximum oil protection at a loading capacity of 12 mg 
 <italic>w/w</italic>%, and an encapsulation efficiency of about 77.89 
 <italic>w/w</italic>%.
