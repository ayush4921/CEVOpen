<p>Composite nanofiber dressings realized from polyurethane encasing lavender oil and silver (Ag) nanoparticles were tested as multifunctional wound dressings [
 <xref rid="B146-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>]. The investigations made on the prepared nanofibers have been shown to provide protection against external agents as well as promote the regeneration of new tissue. The presence of Ag NPs and lavender oil improved the hydrophilicity of the nanofibers and ensured the proliferation of chicken embryo fibroblasts cultured in vitro, as well as the antibacterial efficiency against
