<p>A biocompatible patch, based on gelatin film reinforced with bacterial cellulose polyelectrolyte, was loaded with curcumin and tested from the viewpoint of the wound healing activity [
 <xref rid="B142-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. The obtained patch confirmed antimicrobial activity assessed via Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) analysis and live-dead assay using propidium iodide and 4â€²,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole as fluorescent indicator. Based on the resulting data, the researchers recommended the new prepared hydrogel patch as a new direction in the transdermal drug delivery systems.
