<p>In a recent investigation, it was hypothesized that the association of rosmarinic acid-loaded nanoemulsions with CS would enhance the EO stability, its mucoadhesive properties, the penetration and/or retention, and residence time in the nasal mucosa [

The new formulation was intended to be used as a new approach in neuroprotective therapies and in this context, the cell viability, and death in the MRC-5 fibroblast cell line were evaluated. An optimization program for the preparation of the mucoadhesive chitosan-coated nanoemulsions was developed, and based on this program, the optimized conditions were found, namely 8.5% oil phase (
