<p>Tea Tree and Manuka EOs are known for their biological activity and utilization in aromatherapy or for the treatment of microbial infections, and due to their special properties were tested for encapsulation by electrospinning in PLA fibers [
 <xref rid="B153-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>]. The effects of various concentrations of EOs (from 2.5 up to 15.0 % 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) on the fiber’s morphology, and on the thermal and mechanical properties of fibers, was investigated. The data confirmed the plasticizer potential of both EOs, resulting in lower glass transition temperature up to 40 °C as compared to the one of pristine PLA fibers. Both elongation at break and tensile strength at break increased after increasing the amount of EOs with values up to 12 times higher than those of PLA fibers without EOs. The antibacterial activity corresponding to PLA/Manuka fibers was concretized in inhibition of the 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> growth, whereas PLA/Tea Tree EO mats were ineffective in preventing the biofilm formation.
