<p>A recent research study presented the encapsulation of 
 <italic>Saccocalyx satureioides</italic> Coss. et Durieu EO into nanoemulsions based on 1% of Tween (a polyethylene sorbitol ester), by high-pressure homogenization [
 <xref rid="B162-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>]. It was found that the crystallization of the lipid droplets of the nanoemulsion by rapid cooling at the end of the high-pressure homogenization processing affected the volatile composition of the oil and of the prepared nanoemulsions. A positive effect on antioxidant and anticancer activities was registered, and, as a result, the technique was recommended for use in obtaining pharmaceuticals and in cancer treatment.
