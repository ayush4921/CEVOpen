<p>Recently, the obtainment of antibacterial nanofibers by an oil-in-water emulsion electrospinning procedure was presented. The system was based on PVP and cinnamon oil [
 <xref rid="B158-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>]. The characterization of the new system evidenced its capacity for electro-spinning process, while the antimicrobial properties of the prepared nanofibers were confirmed by the disc diffusion method against

 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>. It was found a correlation between the increase of the viscosity values of the polymer/oil complex after addition of a surfactant, and in interdependence with the increase of the cinnamon concentration, as well as of the average fiber diameter or the spinnability and fiber smoothness.
