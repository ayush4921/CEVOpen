<p>Recent studies presented the incorporation of EOs into electrospun fibers not only to confer bioactivity but also to control some physical characteristics of the resulting mats [

The use of linalool in therapeutics, cosmetics, and antimicrobial and larvicidal products is well known and as result its encapsulation for further controlled release was investigated. In a study of Souza team three different concentrations, namely 10, 15, and 20 wt. %, of linalool oil were incorporated in PLA nanofibrous membranes by electrospinning technique and by solution blow spinning procedure [
 <xref rid="B151-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>]. The average diameters of the new nanofibers were similar, ranging from 176 to 240 nm in both cases of preparation. The plasticizer effect of linalool was put into evidence by the decreased values of the glass transition temperature, melting point and crystallization temperature of the resulted composite. The oil release from PLA nanofibrous membranes followed a Fickian rule. The solution blow spinning procedure proved a better encapsulation of linalool concretized in increased time for release. Increased hydrophobicity of the PLA nanofiber membranes was obtained by both preparation procedures.
