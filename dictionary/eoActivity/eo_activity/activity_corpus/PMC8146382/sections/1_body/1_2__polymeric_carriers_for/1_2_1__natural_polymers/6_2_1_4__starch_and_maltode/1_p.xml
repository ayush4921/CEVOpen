<p>A freeze-drying encapsulation technique was used for microencapsulation of rosemary EO, known through its monoterpenes constituents like 1,8-cineole, by means of two coating materials, namely maltodextrin (MD) and whey protein concentrate (WP) in different coating ratios [
 <xref rid="B121-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. MD was chosen due to its excellent oxygen-blocking property, while WP, the second coating material, shows low viscosity even in high concentrations, and represents an excellent emulsifier. The optimum coating material formulation was obtained after investigating the physicochemical properties and storage stability of microcapsules. The emulsions were analyzed for their particle size distributions, and the freeze-dried capsules for their encapsulation efficiency, surface morphology, and concentrations of 1,8-cineole during storage. The performed encapsulation allows the use of rosemary oil for medical antiseptic and astringent purposes.
