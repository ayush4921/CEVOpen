<p>Alginate is generally utilized due to its chemical stability, pH sensitivity, capacity to form strong gel barriers against water and gases, and biological functionality in appetite regulation [

 <xref rid="B54-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Mina Volić et al. realized a study for the preparation of a carrier of thyme oil, which is known for its expectorant, antitussive, anti-broncholytic, antispasmodic, antihelminthic, carminative, muscle relaxant and diuretic properties [
 <xref rid="B55-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The polymer–thyme oil system, based on the mixture of alginate and soy protein isolate (SPI), was made by emulsifying thyme oil in an aqueous sodium alginate–SPI blend solution, followed by atomization via electrostatic extrusion, and then crosslinking with Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> ions. The composite was chosen to combine the pH sensitivity of alginate with the bioactivity and emulsifying properties of SPI. The new system was capable of intestinal delivery of the EO. The formation of a complex microsphere with a thyme encapsulation efficiency of 72–80% was confirmed after determination of the total polyphenols content, and an oil release of about 42–55%.
