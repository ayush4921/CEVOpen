<p>In another review, by Roberto Scaffaro, some methods used for carvacrol incorporation into the PLA matrix, in relation to the morpho-mechanical properties, release behavior, and antimicrobial activity of the new composite systems, were critically presented [
 <xref rid="B155-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>]. The article presented the potential of PLA/carvacrol composite for the development of drug delivery systems, in the coating of medical devices, or in food packaging. Various methods for carvacrol incorporation into PLA and processing techniques, as for example by melting, solution, or hybrid, which included two- or multi-step protocols, involving both solvent-based and melting-based steps, were also presented.
