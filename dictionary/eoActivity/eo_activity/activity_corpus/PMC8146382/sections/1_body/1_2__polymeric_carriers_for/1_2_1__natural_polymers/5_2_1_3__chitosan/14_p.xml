<p>CS–TPP nanoparticles were encapsulated with eugenol (4-allyl-2-methoxyphenol) a naturally occurring phenolic compound with applicability in pharmaceutical, cosmetics, food, and active packaging domains due to its effective antimicrobial and antioxidant properties [

 <xref rid="B115-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. Eugenol-loaded CS nanoparticles were prepared following the same two-step procedure based on emulsion–ionic gelation crosslinking. The researchers first prepared the oil-in-water (o/w) CS emulsion in the presence of Tween 60 as emulsifier, over which in the second step a variable eugenol and TPP content were dropped. The obtained particles were collected by centrifugation and characterized from the viewpoint of eugenol encapsulation capacity and their improved thermal stability. The new matrix system and method used for eugenol encapsulation allowed a loading capacity (LC) and an encapsulation efficiency (EE) in the ranges of 0.40–12.8% and 1.1–20.2%, respectively, for an initial content of eugenol of 50–125% (

 <italic>w/v</italic>), respectively. An increased content of TPP did not improve the LC or EE for the prepared particles. In addition, improved thermal stability of encapsulated eugenol was registered compared with nude eugenol, as well as greater radical scavenging activity.
