<p>Underlining the EOs alternative to the current antibiotics due to their potent and broad-spectrum antimicrobial potential, unique mechanisms of action and low tendency to induce resistance, Bushra Jamil’group explored the anti-pathogenic potential of some EOs in a bio-based nanocarrier system [
 <xref rid="B109-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. Cardamom oil was selected for nanoencapsulation because of its most potent antimicrobial activity, and it was loaded in CS nanoparticles by ionic gelation method with an encapsulation efficiency of more than 90% in nanoparticles evidencing dimensions of about 50 to 100 nm. The investigation indicated the preparation of stable nano-dispersion with Zeta potential higher than +50 mV, while the cytotoxicity analysis of the obtained nanoparticles proved non-hemolytic and non-cytotoxic behavior on human corneal epithelial cells and HepG2 cell lines. The new nano-encapsulated systems exhibited excellent antimicrobial potential against extended spectrum of β—lactamase producing
