<p>Various biodegradable and biocompatible synthetic polymeric compounds have been electrospun into nanoscale fibers to be further used in the biomedical field including as carriers for drug delivery. From this group PCL, polylactic acid (PLA), polyurethane, and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) are the most currently applied owing to their biodegradable nature, hydrophilicity, chemical, and thermal stability. They have as well good tissue compatibility, solute permeability, and excellent electrospinnability, and, as a result, they were intensively investigated as matrix for various bioactive substances including EOs [
