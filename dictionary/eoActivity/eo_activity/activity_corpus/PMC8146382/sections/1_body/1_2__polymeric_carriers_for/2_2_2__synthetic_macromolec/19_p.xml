<p>The anti-inflammatory and antalgic potency of the 
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> L. EO, and of its nanoemulsion, prepared by using a low-energy loading methodology [
 <xref rid="B163-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>] in the presence of Tween 20, were investigated [
 <xref rid="B164-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>]. The 
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> L. is known for its primarily content of limonene, camphor, and 1,8-cineole. The oil demonstrated a potentiated effect in the nanoemulsion formulation and a potent antalgic effectiveness in doses 600 times lower than those applied with EO alone. What was responsible for the anti-inflammatory and antalgic effects observed in the experimental results, with this new prepared nanoemulsion, was the camphor molecule, which presented the largest number of interactions with the therapeutic targets related to the inflammatory process.
