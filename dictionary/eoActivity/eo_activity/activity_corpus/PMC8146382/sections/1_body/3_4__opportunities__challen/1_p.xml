<p>The multiple benefits offered by EOs, designed by their complex nature, ensure a general growth in terms of both their use, and the areas in which these generous products can find their applicability, in a unique, synergistic, and/or complementary way. At the same time, the nature of EOs, which can promise antimicrobial, antioxidant, antitumor, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory effects, must be protected from environmental conditions, such as light, heat, and humidity, in order to be fully effective in the areas in which they are used. Thus, one of the main challenges faced by scientific researchers is to find structures that ensure the appropriate matrices for encapsulating EOs and their protection, as well as their controlled release under predetermined conditions. In this context, synthetic polymers, together with natural ones, can be an inexhaustible source of networks/matrices for the encapsulation of EOs to ensure their protection. In this regard, researches can generate innovative structures. Moreover, due to the fact that EOs have no major side effects, as most of the conventional medicines and drugs, they can be used to help treat numerous health problems, such as cardiovascular problems, Alzheimerâ€™s, bronchitis, and aromatherapy, for example. Another requirement for researchers is the need to create more demand for beneficial EOs, by seeking new EO biological activities, and investigating the pharmaceutical possibilities of EOs; thus, creating the basis for more possible applications in pharmaceutical and medical applications, or even adjuvants to current medications.</p>
