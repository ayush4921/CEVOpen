<p>As Noha E. El-Attarâ€™s article mentioned, the bioactivity of EOs as dynamic blends depends and varies according to their chemical constitution and structure [
 <xref rid="B179-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">179</xref>]. The research team proposed the development of machine learning-based computational models, namely Multiclass Neural Network (MNN), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), as deep learning techniques, to categorize and predict the biological activities of EOs based on their chemical construction variations, without recourse to the in vitro experiments. Data and comparison between these algorithms showed that CNN outperformed MNN with an accuracy rate of about 98.13%, while MNN recorded 81.88%.
