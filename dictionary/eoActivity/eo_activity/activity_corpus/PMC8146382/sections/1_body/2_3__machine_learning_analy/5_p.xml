<p>In a machine learning algorithm application, the development of quantitative activityâ€“composition relationship classification models was used to point out the EO chemical components more involved in the inhibition of biofilm production [
 <xref rid="B175-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">175</xref>]. The authors concluded the performed classification model, validated by five performance metrics, as an example, showing machine learning as a tool to investigate complex chemical mixtures, and possibly in prospective experiments, understanding the mechanism by which EOs act. Moreover, in case of the increased number of experiments, the generated model enables the identification of EO blends, specifically designed to obtain products with strong anti-biofilm efficacy, applicable in many fields: airborne decontamination, products for dermatological and respiratory tract infections, etc.
