<p>Researchers used genetic algorithm and multiple linear regression (GA-MLR), partial least square (GA-PLS), kernel PLS (GA-KPLS), and the Levenberg Marquardt artificial neural network (L-M ANN) techniques in order to investigate the correlation between retention index (RI) and descriptors for 116 diverse compounds in EOs of six Stachys species [

At the same time, it was confirmed the possibility to apply L-M ANN model to describe the molecular structure characteristic of these compounds. In this way, the artificial intelligence introduced in chromatographic treatment allows solving the automatic compensation of random retention times [
