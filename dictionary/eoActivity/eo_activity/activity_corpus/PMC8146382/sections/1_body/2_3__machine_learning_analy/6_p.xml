<p>Due to EO use as a natural antibiotic in complementary and alternative medicine, artificial neural network (ANN) was applied for the prediction of some EO antimicrobial activity [
 <xref rid="B176-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">176</xref>]. In this context, 49 EOs, extracts, and/or fractions with chemical composition and antimicrobial activity extracted from the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards compliant works (NCCLS) were used. The output data reflecting the antimicrobial activity of the tested EOs against four common pathogens, namely 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans</italic>, and 
 <italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic> as measured by standardized disk diffusion assays, were implemented in the fast artificial neural networks software. The artificial neural networks were able to predict &gt; 70% of the antimicrobial activities within a 10 mm maximum error range, and two or three different bioactivities were predicted at the same time.
