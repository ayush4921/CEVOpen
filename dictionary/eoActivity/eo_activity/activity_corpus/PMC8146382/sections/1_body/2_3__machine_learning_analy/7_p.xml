<p>Based on the experimental data and due to the interest in the development of new approaches in the prevention and treatment of bacterial biofilm under the influence of EOs, which can modulate biofilm production, with unpredictable results leading to either bacterial biofilm inhibition or reduction, depending on EO chemical composition and on type of microorganism, a machine learning application for the complex matrix of data from 89 EO chemical analyses was investigated [
