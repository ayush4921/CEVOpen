<p>In another investigation study that used the computational models, a computational tool was developed to select EOs that have antimicrobial activities in relation to their effective compounds, but without complex laboratory analysis [

Thus, they established a new computational tool named the Essential Oil Reduction and Optimization Tool (EOROT) to determine the best and optimal EO in inhibiting the activity of the bacteria growth. The main phases of the study consisted in determining the EO chemical composition, reducing the number of the chemical compounds by specifying the main antibacterial compounds and establishing the rules of the relationship between these compounds, and finally, deciding on the EOs with high antibacterial activities, and concluding for the most-suited EO for every type of the bacteria. Unfortunately this research was limited to only 24 EOs tested toward 17 kinds of bacteria.
