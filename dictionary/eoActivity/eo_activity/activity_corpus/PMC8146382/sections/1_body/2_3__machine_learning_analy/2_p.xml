<p>For example, Lucy Owen et al. article concluded on the importance of the quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) studies on antimicrobial effects of EOs components, which may provide promising targets for identification and future bacterial screening [
 <xref rid="B171-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>]. The authors investigated the structureâ€“activity relationship of EOs compounds for target identification and optimization. In this context, 12 EO components were tested, and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of EO components were determined against 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> using a microdilution method, which were further compared to those from the literature. MICs and FORGE software by consideration of electrostatic and steric parameters were used to generate a 3D qualitative SAR model. They found that the steric effects of some EO components have been shown as a structural commonality between inhibitory molecules, with the electrostatic properties and topography correlating well with the lowest MICs. Thus, between the investigated EOs carvacrol and menthol presented the lowest MICs against 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, with highly correlated electrostatic topographies.
