<p>In another investigation random forests machine learning algorithm was applied to the classification of 20 different EOs in order to use their differences in chemical profiles as chemical markers for EO classification and determination of the quality [
 <xref rid="B174-pharmaceutics-13-00631" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>]. The total chromatogram average mass spectra (TCAMS) and segment average mass spectra (SAMS) were created from three-way raw gas chromatographyâ€“mass spectra data, and the resulted SAMS data set showed superior potential for quality assurance, compared with TCAMS, while TCAMS is much faster and more readily created. Moreover, both models showed excellent performance in the classification of EO classes.
