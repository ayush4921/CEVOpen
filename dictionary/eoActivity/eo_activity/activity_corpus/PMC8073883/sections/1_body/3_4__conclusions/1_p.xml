<p>Natural compounds possess an inherent ability to bind with biomolecules and provide diverse bioactivity such as anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, anti-aging, and antioxidant activity. Many natural products and their derivatives belong to different phytochemical classes such as polyphenols and flavonoids, polysaccharides, peptides, fatty acids, and have been identified as modulators of SIRT6. Sources of these compounds include various vegetables, fruits, grains, marine weeds, herbs, and medicinal plants. SIRT6 is a stress response protein deacetylase, and upregulation and downregulation of this protein has been associated with multiple disease processes. Studies have shown that some of the identified natural compounds can increase the deacetylation activity of SIRT6, and some have reported to decrease the deacetylation activity of it. Regular intake of these pure compounds or foods enriched with these compounds might be beneficial in the treatment of Alzheimerâ€™s disease, aging, cancer, inflammation, and diabetes. However, the absolute potential to activate or inhibit SIRT6 in order to impart a therapeutic effect remains to be eluded. Thus, future research should have a vast scope to further characterize natural compounds and their derivatives with isoform selectivity, more potency, and more drug-like properties for the treatment of variegated diseases.</p>
