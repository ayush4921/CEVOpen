<p>Natural products are structurally distinct compounds obtained from diverse sources such as plants, microorganisms, animals, insects, minerals, and marine organisms [

 <xref rid="B2-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Approximately 60% of all available drugs have been directly or indirectly derived from natural products such as aspirin, digoxin, morphine, artemisinin, camptothecin, lovastatin, maytansine, paclitaxel, penicillin, reserpine, and silibinin. Natural compounds have long been used for the amelioration of disease symptoms as well as prevention of diseases, or the complete recovery from various disorders [

Natural products with diverse pharmacological properties play a crucial role by providing a novel lead template for drug discovery and development. They form the basis of a wide array of modern medicines produced in the pharmaceutical and biotechnological industries [

 <xref rid="B4-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Biological effects of natural products can be explained by their binding with biological macromolecules since natural products complement the protein-binding sites and natural productâ€“protein interactions are already optimized in nature [

 <xref rid="B6-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Thus, natural product-derived scaffolds serve as superior template for the lead optimization [
 <xref rid="B7-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Using combinatorial chemistry and human metabolites has revealed that the drugs are more similar to naturally occurring metabolites; thus, natural products are better than the screening molecules due to their inherent bioactivity [
 <xref rid="B8-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Another study reported that as compared with synthetic compounds and combinatorial libraries, natural products might not have side effects; they have a wider distribution of molecular properties, such as structural diversity, low molecular mass, and partition coefficient; they have more interaction with proteins, enzymes, and other biomolecules; they contain fewer heavy metals, and possess higher molecular rigidity [
