<p>Several key cell signaling pathways are attributed to mitogenic, cytotoxic, and genotoxic aberrations causing disease pathologies. All of these signaling pathways are regulated by natural products with significant bioactivities [

It has been reported that compounds such as anagyrine, cytosine, sparteine, and lupanine produce their biological responses through mimicking endogenous molecules that are involved in intercellular or intracellular signal transduction. Conversely, different organisms utilize similar molecules for identical purposes, for example, brassinolide, which is structurally similar to human growth regulating steroids is used for cell division and development in plants [
