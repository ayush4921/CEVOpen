<p>SIRT6 provides more demyristoylation activity on peptide substrates as compared with deacetylation activity, but it catalyzes heavy histone deacetylation on whole chromatin and nucleosomes [

 <xref rid="B25-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. SIRT6 is effective in metabolism and DNA homeostasis; this has been demonstrated by studies that have shown extended lifespan of male mice through attenuated aging [
 <xref rid="B26-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Therefore, activation of pharmacologic SIRT6 is beneficial for aging disorders. Apart from the deacetylation activity, SIRT6 also functions as a mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase. SIRT6 deacetylates lysine, which then gets coupled with NAD+ hydrolysis that produces nicotinamide and O-acetyl-ADP ribose [

 <xref rid="B28-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This reaction is meant to allosterically inhibit the function of SIRT6 due to the production of nicotinamide. SIRT6 works at the molecular level to control the apoptosis, metabolism, aging, development, stress tolerance, and inflammation as a mono-ADP-ribosyl transferase-mediated by the SIRT6 gene in mammals [
 <xref rid="B29-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. SIRT6 is released from the nucleoli and is usually linked to the heterochromatic cell areas [
 <xref rid="B30-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The highest levels of SIRT6 have been found in the liver, brain, thymus, muscles, and heart, where SIRT6 influences tissue-specific transcriptional regulation [
 <xref rid="B31-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. SIRT6 facilitates tolerance to DNA degradation and oxidative stress [
 <xref rid="B29-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. SIRT6 dysfunction or SIRT6 inactivation contributes to shortening lives and degenerative phenotypes in mice [
 <xref rid="B32-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Deficiency of SIRT6 in mice showed severe age-related abnormalities such as loss of subcutaneous fat and extreme lymphopenia [
 <xref rid="B33-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Compared to wild-type SIRT6 (WT), SIRT6-knockout (KO) mice appear normal in body weight at birth. However, within two weeks, metabolic/degenerative symptoms, including severe hypoglycemia, lymphocytic apoptosis, and wastage, are identified. Although the lymphocyte count is regular at conception, lymphocytes are destroyed in a systemic reaction in the process of apoptosis at about three weeks of age. Finally, the mice with SIRT6KO die at about four weeks. Cells of SIRT6KO have genetic instability, hypersensitive disruption to DNA, and other anomalies in their physiology [

 <xref rid="B35-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. SIRT6-specific knockdown cells (SIRT6 KD) are exposed to preterm cellular senescence and telomere disruption, as well as end-to-end chromosome fusion, where the degree of SIRT6 expression is decreased [
