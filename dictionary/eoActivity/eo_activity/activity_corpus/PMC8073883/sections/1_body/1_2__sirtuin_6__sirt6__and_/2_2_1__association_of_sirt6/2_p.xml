<p>Recent studies of genomes have found that chromatin discomposure and diminished repetitive DNA element silencing, such as silencing of retrotransposons, telomeres, and centromeres, are responsible for mammalian aging [
 <xref rid="B11-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In fact, in aged tissues and cells, abnormal transcription and destabilization of these elements are observed [

 <xref rid="B20-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. SIRT6 has chromatin-regulatory activity at telomeres. In the Werner syndrome (premature aging disorder), deacetylation of SIRT6-dependent histone at telomeres produces a particular chromatin condition which is essential for DNA processing in the binding of ATP-dependent helicase of Werner syndrome (WRN) [

Destabilization of repressive heterochromatin allows transcription of telomere-proximal genes, and deregulation of these genes causes cellular changes in aging and SIRT6 does reverse this phenomenon by stabilizing the repressive heterochromatin at the sub-telomeric region through silencing transcription of such genes [

 <xref rid="B21-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Studies have revealed that reduced SIRT6 activity is linked to impaired heterochromatin sustentation, which leads to a premature aging disorder called Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) in humans [
 <xref rid="B22-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) contributes to recognize DNA damage and facilitates the choice of repair pathways, and SIRT6 is found to activate PARP1 when DNA damaged is occurred by oxidative stress [
