<p>SIRT6 has recently received considerable attention since several studies have proven its critical roles in metabolism. SIRT6 controls regional and systemic energy metabolism and insulin resistance in major insulin-producing and insulin-target tissues such as adipose tissue, pancreatic β cells, skeletal muscle, and kidney [

SIRT6 can be regarded as an attractive target in the metabolic activity of glucose in light of animal studies conducted to develop new and efficient antidiabetics. In a previous study, it has been seen that mice with SIRT6 deficiency showed elevated uptake of glucose by tissue, high expression of glucose transporter glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), and thus produced hypoglycemia [

An important glycolytic regulator, HIF1-α, modulates many genes such as lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH), triose-phosphate isomerase (TPI), GLUT1, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK1) either to increase glycolytic flux or to prevent mitochondrial respiration. It is noteworthy to mention that SIRT6 has been found to interact with this key glycolytic regulator HIF1-α and corepress it [

SIRT6 has also been observed to regulate gluconeogenesis; reduced glucose production is linked to reduced SIRT6 levels. Decreasing levels of SIRT6 deactivate general control non-repressed protein 5, which is responsible for increased acetylation levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1α); thus, PGC-1α decreases the expression of gluconeogenic genes [

 <xref rid="B47-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. SIRT6 plays a potential role in regulating glucose since its deficiency leads to hypoglycemia by increasing insulin signaling and activating protein kinase, protein kinase B (Akt) [
 <xref rid="B43-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. SIRT6 in pancreatic β-cells deacetylates the forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1) protein which in turns enhances the expression of two genes, i.e., pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (Pdx1) and glucose transporter 2 (Glut2) to regulate the glucose sensing ability of pancreatic β-cells and systemic glucose tolerance [
