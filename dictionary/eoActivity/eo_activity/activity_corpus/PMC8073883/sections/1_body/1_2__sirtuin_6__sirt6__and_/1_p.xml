<p>Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide+ (NAD+) dependent histone deacetylase enzyme and a unique member of the Sirtuin family. It displays histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9), and histone 3 lysine 56 (H3K56) deacetylase, mono-ADP ribosyltransferase, and acylase activities, and these activities of SIRT6 are associated with the regulation of many genes [
