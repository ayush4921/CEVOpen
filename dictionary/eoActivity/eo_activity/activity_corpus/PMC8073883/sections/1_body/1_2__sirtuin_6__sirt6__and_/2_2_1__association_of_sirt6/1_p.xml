<p>Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) is one of the most common and devastating neurodegenerative diseases. There are several proposed mechanisms implicated in its progression including, but not limited to, lysosomal storage, the effect of glial cells, and aggregation of tau proteins [

 <xref rid="B19-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Cells without SIRT6 cannot repair damaged DNA double-strand breaks and have insufficient base excision repairing capacity. SIRT6 repairs DNA damage recruiting chromatin remodeler SNF2H and deacylating H3K56 on those damaged sites. Studies have found that SIRT6 deficient mice showed more DNA damage; moreover, aged mice were characterized by reduced levels of SIRT6 [
