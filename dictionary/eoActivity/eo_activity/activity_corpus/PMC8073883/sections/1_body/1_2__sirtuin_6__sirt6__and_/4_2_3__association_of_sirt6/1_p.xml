<p>SIRT6 also plays an important role in the modulation of immune reactions and inflammatory suppression throughout different parts of the human body. SIRT6 can regulate several NF-κB gene transcriptions both directly and indirectly [

 <xref rid="B43-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. SIRT6 directly influences a promoter of the NF-κB expression. SIRT6 alters tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) levels by monitoring post-translation rearrangement and involves the synthesis of interferon gamma (IFNγ). Such regulatory mechanisms provide an essential route to managing inflammatory cytokines associated with cell-mediated immunity and inflammation, making the nicotinamide phosphoryl transferase (Nampt)-SIRT6 axis. As a result, SIRT6 inhibitors may affect this regulatory pathway [

Another study showed that SIRT6 has a role in promoting the expression of proinflammatory cyto-/chemokines such as interleukin-8 (IL8) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF); these results confirmed the role of it in the expression of proinflammatory cytokines [
