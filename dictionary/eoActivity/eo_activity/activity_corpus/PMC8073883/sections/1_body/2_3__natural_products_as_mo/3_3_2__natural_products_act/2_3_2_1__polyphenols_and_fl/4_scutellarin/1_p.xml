<p>Scutellarin is a natural flavone compound found in the Chinese herb Huang Qin. It was studied by Shuang Zhao et al. to find its interaction with SIRT6 and was found to inhibit SIRT6 activity through hydrophobic and, potentially, π-stacking interaction. The configuration of scutellarin matching with SIRT6 also played a vital role in SIRT6 inhibition. It is worth mentioning that the Chinese people use this herb to cure cancer. Thus, the SIRT6 inhibitory effect of scutellarin may contribute to its chemotherapeutic potential [

Oxidative stress inhibition was assessed by measuring the level of ROS, malondialdehyde (MDA), SOD, and GSH activity where ROS and MDA levels were found to decrease and SOD and GSH levels were found to increase. In addition, it has been reported that scutellarin has a role in promoting the activation of the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway [

It has been reported that cisplatin-induced release of proinflammatory cytokines, TNF-α and IL-6, were suppressed by pretreatment with scutellarin in cisplatin-treated mice, while the anti-inflammatory effect produced by scutellarin was comparable to the positive control drug dexamethasone. Consequently, scutellarin demonstrated effective anti-inflammatory activity which was significant for the deterrence of cisplatin-induced renal damage [
