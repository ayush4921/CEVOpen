<p>Isoquercetin is also a naturally occurring flavonoid available in a vast number of natural sources such as medicinal herbs, fruits, beverages, vegetables, onions, mangoes, Tartary buckwheat bran, and Chinese hawthorn fruits (

 <xref rid="B65-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. It acts as a selective SIRT6 activator since it only binds to the SIRT6-selective acyl binding channel through its ability to distinguish between the SIRT6-selective acyl binding channel and an alternative binding site at the entrance of the active binding site of SIRT6. Furthermore, an isoform selectivity study of isoquercetin revealed that the bulky sugar moiety accommodates SIRT6’s acyl channel [
