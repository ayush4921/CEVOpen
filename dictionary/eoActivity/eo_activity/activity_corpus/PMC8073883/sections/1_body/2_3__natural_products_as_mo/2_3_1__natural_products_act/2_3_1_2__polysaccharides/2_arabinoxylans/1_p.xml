A recent study reported that a polysaccharide, arabinoxylan-riched psyllium seed husk (PSH) upregulated SIRT6 expression in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. Psyllium seed husk contains arabinoxylan 60 wt. % of PSH. The mechanism of SIRT6 stimulation by PSH might be the binding of pCREB to the binding site CRE on SIRT6 gene promoter ([
