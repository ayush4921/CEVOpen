 <xref rid="B76-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Cyanidin has slightly increased SIRT6 activation potency and efficacy. The higher potency of cyanidin is due to an absence of the keto group at position 4 of the C-ring which eliminates unfavorable interaction with Met157 of SIRT6 [
 <xref rid="B26-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In vitro study of cyanidin for its SIRT6 deacetylation activity has been conducted, and it has been found to be a potent SIRT6 stimulator with 55-fold maximum activity with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 460 ± 20 µM. Using Western blots, the SIRT6 deacetylation activity of cyanidin was estimated using core histone and the residual levels of histone H3 acetylation on lysine 9. Furthermore, cyanidin was found to upregulate SIRT6 associated gene, FOXO3α significantly, whereas it downregulated Twist1 and GLUT1 genes. The FOXO3α gene is involved in cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and longevity, and more importantly, downregulation of the FOXO3α gene can result in a tumor. SIRT6 regulates FOXO3α by forming a complex with it, which as a result, upregulates the genes involved in antioxidation. Additionally, overexpression of the twist-related protein 1 (Twist1) and GLUT1 genes are associated with many tumors, and Twist1 is a crucial factor for tumor metastasis. SIRT6 suppresses cell proliferation through Twist1, and it also regulates metabolic cancer cell reprogramming through GLUT1 [
