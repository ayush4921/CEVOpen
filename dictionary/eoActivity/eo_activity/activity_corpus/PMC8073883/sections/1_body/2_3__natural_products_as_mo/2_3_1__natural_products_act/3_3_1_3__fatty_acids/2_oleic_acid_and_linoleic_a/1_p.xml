<p>Oleic acid is found in plant-based oil (olive oil), nuts, vegetables [
 <xref rid="B93-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>], and linoleic acid is naturally available in plant-based oil, nut, meat, and animal products [
 <xref rid="B96-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. Both oleic acid and linoleic acid have been reported as potent activators of SIRT6. These long-chain fatty acids bind with a large hydrophobic pocket of SIRT6, and thus induce a conformational change that stimulates the deacetylation activity of SIRT6. Rahnasto-Rilla et al. studied a series of ethanolamides to identify whether they inhibit or activate SIRT6. They found that all these compounds exhibited a strong activating effect on SIRT6 at 100 µM concentrations with the fatty acids, thereby demonstrating a direct regulation relationship [
