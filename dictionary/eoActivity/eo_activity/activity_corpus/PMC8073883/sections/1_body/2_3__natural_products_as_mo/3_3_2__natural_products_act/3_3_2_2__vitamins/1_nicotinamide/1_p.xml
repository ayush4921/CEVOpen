<p>It is an amide form of vitamin B3 and is naturally found in eggs, meat, fish, and mushrooms [

 <xref rid="B109-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. Studies have shown that nicotinamide hindered SIRT6 with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 184 μM. It blocked multiplication and advanced apoptosis in leukemic cells just as repressing the development and feasibility of human prostate cancer cells. It inhibited the proliferation while promoting apoptosis, specifically in leukemic and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells. SIRT6 acts as a tumor suppressor by promoting DNA repair and genome stability, glucose homeostasis, etc. [

 <xref rid="B119-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. Nicotinamide exerts its antidiabetic action by protecting the damage of pancreatic β-cells and preventing apoptosis and NO generation [
 <xref rid="B128-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that nicotinamide is an inhibitor of SIRT6; therefore, suppressing nicotinamide can lead to SIRT6 protective effect against premature aging, hindering cancer growth, reducing the expression of IL8 and TNF as well as the reduction of serum glucose level [
