<p>It has been reported that myristoyl (MEA), oleoyl (OEA), and palmitoyl (PEA) ethanolamides resulted in the strongest SIRT6 activation, which was comparable to linoleic acid at the same concentration. However, at 10 ÂµM concentration, linoleic acid was more effective as a SIRT6 activator than the ethanolamides of fatty acid [

The discovery of small molecules as SIRT6 activators demonstrates the potential of compounds that stimulate SIRT6 activity as anti-inflammatory and anti-tumorigenesis deacetylase. Feldman et al. studied the deacylase activity of SIRT1 to SIRT7, and they found that SIRT6 was very particular to deacylase the long-chain fatty acids such as myristoyl and palmitoyl chains. These fatty acid derivatives are expected to upregulate the SIRT6 activity, and therefore can be used as a therapeutic target for inflammation and cancer [
