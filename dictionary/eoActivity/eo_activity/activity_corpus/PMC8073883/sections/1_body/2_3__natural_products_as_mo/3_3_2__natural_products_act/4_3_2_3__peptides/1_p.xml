<p>Kokkonen et al. [
 <xref rid="B132-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>] investigated several peptides and pseudo peptides against SIRT1-SIRT6 and found that compound 5 was the most potent SIRT6 inhibitor with a 54% percentage rate. The longer peptide with the correct set of side chains was found more effective to bind with SIRT6. Thiomyristoyl peptides were studied to detect whether they can modulate SIRT6 or not. The finding revealed that thiomyristoyl peptides, mainly the BHJH-TM3 peptide, showed potent SIRT6 inhibition activity since it increased the lysine fatty acylation level of TNF-Î±. A tetrapeptide, i.e., chlamydocin, which was extracted from the organism 
 <italic>Diheterospora chlamydosporia</italic> can also inhibit SIRT6 [
