<p>The deacetylase function of SIRT6 has been endogenously activated by long-chain fatty acids [
 <xref rid="B108-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. The SIRT6 activator attachment on the distal portion of the fatty acyl substrate in the SIRT6 pocket has also been found with small molecules [
 <xref rid="B26-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Deacetylation of SIRT6 has been induced with free long chains of fatty acids [
 <xref rid="B95-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Studies have demonstrated that free fatty acid with divergent acyl chain length activates SIRT6 deacetylation by competitively inhibiting the peptide-conjugated myristoyl chain and occupying the hydrophobic pocket of SIRT6 [
 <xref rid="B109-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. Klein et al. investigated 64 fatty acids along with 190 bioactive lipids for initial targeted screening to identify selective SIRT6 activators, and they found that many of them stimulated SIRT6 with 5- to 12-fold activation [
 <xref rid="B110-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. They further identified a SIRT6 activator with more potency and selectivity through a SAR-guided chemical optimization study, where the activation of SIRT6 was mediated through the acceleration of catalytic step transpiring after substrate binding but before NAD+ cleavage [
 <xref rid="B109-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. Free fatty acids comprising 12 to 18 carbons were capable of enhancing SIRT6 deacetylation activity up to 35-fold [
 <xref rid="B109-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. One study found that, in SIRT6 knockout mice, intake of a high-fat diet could reverse metabolic disorders and premature aging, because fatty acids might be a better energy source to switch the physiological mechanisms [
 <xref rid="B110-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. SIRT6 can control circadian chromatin recruitment of SREBP-1, which regulates genes implicated in fatty acid metabolism. Hence, the SIRT6 knockout mice experienced disruption in fatty acid metabolism [
 <xref rid="B111-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. A novel SIRT6 activator, namely ginsenoside Rc, has been identified and ameliorated high fat diet-induced mitochondrial stress, oxidative stress, and inflammatory damage in mice [
