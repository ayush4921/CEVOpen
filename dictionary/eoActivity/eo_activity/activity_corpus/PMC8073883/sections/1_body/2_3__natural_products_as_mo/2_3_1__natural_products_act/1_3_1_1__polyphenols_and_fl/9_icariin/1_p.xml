<p>Icariin is a prenyl flavonoid glycoside which is the primary active compound of 
 <italic>Herba epimedii.</italic> It has been found to upregulate SIRT6 expression, decrease NF-κB protein expression, and inhibit anti-inflammatory response in mice [
 <xref rid="B97-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. It has been reported to exert anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antidepressant, and anti-aging effects [

 <xref rid="B99-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Ovarian cancer cells (A2780) treated with different icariin concentrations inhibited cell proliferation, accelerated apoptosis, and caspase-3 activity by targeting phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), reversion-inducing cysteine-rich protein with kazal motifs (RECK), and Bcl-2 protein expression in A2780 cells [
 <xref rid="B99-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. The anticancer effect of icariin was also studied in mouse Leydig tumors cells (MLTC-1). The findings revealed that icariin promoted cancer cell apoptosis by regulating the expression of Bcl-2/Bax and cytochrome c, activation of caspase-9, and -3 [

 <xref rid="B101-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Furthermore, studies have also reported that anti-aging properties of icariin resulted in the inhibition of p53/p21 and NF-κB signaling pathways, and enhanced SIRT6 expression [
