<p>Due to the significant implications of SIRT6 deacetylation, discovering activators and inhibitors of this enzyme has become a priority. SIRT6 inhibitors are found to inhibit cancer cell growth and promote apoptosis [

 <xref rid="B52-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Natural compounds with significant potency, isoform selectivity, and drug-like properties are needed to be identified to find SIRT6 as a validated target, and recently several natural compounds have been reported to modulate SIRT6 activity effectively [
