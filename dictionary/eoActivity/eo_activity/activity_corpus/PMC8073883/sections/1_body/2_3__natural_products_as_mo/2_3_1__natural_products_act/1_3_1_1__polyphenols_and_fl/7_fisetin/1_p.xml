<p>Fisetin is a bioactive flavonol which is abundantly found in fruits, vegetables, and medicinal herbs, including apples, grapes, persimmons, strawberries, cucumbers, and onions [
 <xref rid="B79-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. It has anticancer, antioxidant, antidiabetic, neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and other beneficial health effects [

 <xref rid="B73-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Polyphenol fisetin is found to interfere with the molecular mechanisms involved in cell proliferation and cell death [
 <xref rid="B38-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. It has been reported to activate SIRT6. It has structural similarity with quercetin except for a hydroxyl group at the 5-C position [
 <xref rid="B53-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Thus, fisetin may bind with SIRT6-specific acyl binding channel to activate SIRT6. This natural compound was studied to reveal its effect on oxidative stress. The result showed that it inhibited ROS production through the activation of SIRT6, other SIRTs, and reduction of FOXO3a gene expression [
 <xref rid="B73-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Its anti-aging activity plays a crucial in the treatment AD patient and it exerts its anti-aging activity via reduction of Ckd5 activator p35 cleavage product, p25 in the brains of Alzheimer’s disease [
 <xref rid="B53-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. It also prevented the expression of cell adhesion molecules and suppressed NF-κB in vascular inflammatory responses [
 <xref rid="B78-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Furthermore, fisetin has been reported to have anticancer activity against several cancer cells such as lung, colon, prostate, pancreas, and melanoma. The mechanism of fisetin’s anticancer action involves apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, suppression of Akt/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways, activation of caspase-7 and -9, inhibition of various key enzymes, and downregulation of several genes associated with cancers [

 <xref rid="B79-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Another health benefit of fisetin is its antidiabetic effect and reduction of methylglyoxal dependent protein glycation has been evidenced as its mode of antidiabetic action [
