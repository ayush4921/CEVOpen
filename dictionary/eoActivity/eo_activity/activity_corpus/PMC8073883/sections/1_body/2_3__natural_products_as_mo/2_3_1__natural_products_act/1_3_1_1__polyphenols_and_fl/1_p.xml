<p>Natural polyphenols are plant-derived secondary metabolites with diverse pharmacological potentials [
 <xref rid="B52-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Flavonoids belong to the polyphenol group act via different pathways and mechanisms involved in cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, aging, metabolic syndrome, and inflammation, thus helping cure them. They are found to exert their beneficial effects in disease prevention [
 <xref rid="B54-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Oxidative stress generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), and ROS are responsible for neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and aging [
 <xref rid="B55-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Flavonoids exert their antioxidant effect by inhibiting enzymes involved in the free radical formation and subsequently suppress the generation of ROS [

SIRT6 regulates many stress responding genes by deacetylating histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) and histone 3 lysine 56 (H3K56) and through its mono-ADP ribosyltransferase and deacylase activities. A deficiency of SIRT6 in cells causes sensitivity to oxidative stress, and thus the DNA repair ability of the cells is reduced. Moreover, underexpression of SIRT6 in knockout mice has shown many early hallmarks of aging, whereas overexpression of SIRT6 extended the life span of the knock-out mice as compared with their counterpart [
