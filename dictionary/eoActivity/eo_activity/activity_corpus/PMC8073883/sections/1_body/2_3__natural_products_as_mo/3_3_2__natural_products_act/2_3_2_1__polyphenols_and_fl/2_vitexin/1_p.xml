<p>Vitexin is an apigenin flavone glycoside naturally available in hawthorn berry, mung beans, bamboo, buckwheat, echinodorus, and passiflora [
 <xref rid="B116-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. It is a primary polyphenolic compound of mung beans [
 <xref rid="B117-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. Singh et al. studied vitexin along with other flavonoids to screen their SIRT6 modulating potential, and they reported vitexin as a SIRT6 inhibitor [
 <xref rid="B114-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. Inhibitors belong to flavonoid mainly bind with a site close to the binding site of nicotinamide (NAM) moiety of NAD+ [
 <xref rid="B52-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In addition, pharmacophore mapping has revealed that vitexin’s bulky sugar moiety poses a strain in the mapping of hydroxyl bond acceptor and reduces interaction with hydroxyl bond donor in the receptor which changes binding mode of vitexin [

In another study, vitexin at 10, and 100 µM concentrations were found to decrease ROS level and increase glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels, thus producing antioxidant effects and it was also evidenced as effective in the treatment of neurological disorders. Vitexin’s neuroprotecitve effect is attributed to downregulation of HIF1-α and VEGF and maintenance of blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Vitexin provides neuroprotection in AD by attenuating brain edema [

 <xref rid="B119-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. Vitexin generated an anticancer effect against several cancer cells including T24 bladder cancer and cell lung cancer A549 cells through the induction of apoptosis and regulation of expression of apoptosis-linked p53 and Bcl-2 genes. [

 <xref rid="B120-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. Several studies have reported the anti-inflammatory effect of vitexin and this effect was produced by different mechanisms such as inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines, i.e., IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, and IL-33, TNF-α, and inhibition of iNOS enzyme activation [
