 <xref rid="B72-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Rahnasto-Rilla et al. studied several flavonoids, including luteolin, by docking to find potent SIRT6 modulators, and they discovered that luteolin increased the deacetylation of SIRT6 at a high concentration [
 <xref rid="B52-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In another study, luteolin produced increasing SIRT6 peptide deacetylation in a dose-dependent manner with a maximum two-fold stimulation [
 <xref rid="B58-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Luteolin activates SIRT6 by binding with SIRT6-specific acyl binding channel [

 <xref rid="B73-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. This natural compound was also studied to reveal its impact on oxidative stress. The findings showed that it inhibited ROS production through the elevation of SIRT6 and other SIRTs FOXO3a expression [
 <xref rid="B73-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory effect of luteolin is linked to its selective inhibition of COX-2, reduction of NFkappaB, and AP-1 activity [

 <xref rid="B73-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Anticancer potential of any natural compound is of great importance and luteolin has this potential due to its inhibitory effect on topoisomerase I and II enzymes [
