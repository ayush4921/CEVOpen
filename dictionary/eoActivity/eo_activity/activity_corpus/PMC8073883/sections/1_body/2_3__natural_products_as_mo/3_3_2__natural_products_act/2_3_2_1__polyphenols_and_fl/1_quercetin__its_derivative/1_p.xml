<p>Rahnasto-Rilla et al. showed the SIRT6 modulating activity of several natural compounds, where quercetin and luteolin at lower concentration inhibited SIRT6 deacetylation activity [

 <xref rid="B60-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Quercetin and luteolin provide their SIRT6 inhibitory effect by binding with an alternative site found on the entrance of an active site of SIRT6 [

 <italic>Morus nigra.</italic> Among them, two quercetin derivatives, diquercetin and 2-chloro-1,4-naphthoquinone quercetin, were reported as promising SIRT6 inhibitors with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 130 and 55 µM, respectively. An interaction study of these polyphenolics with SIRT6 identified that diquercetin binds with the binding site of nicotinamide moiety (NAM), whereas 2-chloro-1,4-naphthoquinone-quercetin binds to the substrate-binding site of SIRT6 [

 <sup>2+</sup> -dependent mitochondrial pathway as well as through the inhibition of sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>-ATPase (SERCA). It was also been reported that some quercetin derivatives stimulate SERCA activity; thus, modulation of SERCA activity can be an effective approach to treat cancer and diabetes as these diseases are caused by SERCA activity impairment and disruption of Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> balance in the body. Most importantly, SIRT6 regulates Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> homeostasis by regulating the production of Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> mobilizing nucleotides [
