<p>Catechin is a polyphenolic compound naturally found in various foods and herbs, including tea, apples, persimmons, cacaos, grapes, and berries [
 <xref rid="B121-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. It showed significant inhibition of SIRT6 activity when the rational structure-activity relationship(SAR) of several polyphenolic compounds were studied to determine their SIRT6 histone deacetylation activity modulation. Catechin, epicatechin (cis stereoisomer of catechin), and (-) gallocatechin were studied to find their inhibition or activation potency against SIRT6 and the study revealed that the catechin (trans isomeric form) was the most potent among them as SIRT6 inhibitor [

 <xref rid="B52-ijms-22-04180" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The structural basis of SIRT6 inhibition by small molecules was studied by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and found that hydrophobic and Ï€-stacking interactions are crucial for inhibition of SIRT6. Configuration matching is also important for SIRT6 inhibition [
