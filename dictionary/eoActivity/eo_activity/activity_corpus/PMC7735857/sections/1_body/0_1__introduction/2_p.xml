<p>Inflammation can usually be classified into two categories according to its course: acute inflammation and chronic inflammation. The immune system plays a key role in determining whether inflammation is acute or chronic. The activation of inflammation is closely related to immune cells and biological molecules. In particular, innate lymphoid cells (LCs), with multiple immune functions, play important roles in inflammatory diseases [
