<p>In the essential oil extracted from 
 <italic>Cinnamomum cassia</italic> Presl, a variety of substances, such as benzenepropanal, (E)-cinnamaldehyde and turmerone, were detected [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. They can reduce the inflammatory response after different kinds of stimuli. After formalin and CFA were injected into the foot of the mice [
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], the mice that took oral oil significantly improved their paw licking behavior. At the same time, the levels of TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, NO, IL-1
 <italic>β,</italic> and PGE 2 in paw oedema tissues induced by carrageenan were reduced in a dose-dependent manner [
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. EO showed an inhibitory effect on acetic acid-induced abdominal contraction. The expression of COX-2 and iNOS in the skin tissues of the feet of mice with essential oils decreased. This shows that this essential oil has a certain anti-inflammatory effect.
