<p>In intestinal inflammation diseases, the levels TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>, IL-6, and IL-12 are significantly higher than those in noninflamed intestines [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Intestinal inflammation is often accompanied by mucosal immune system disorders. Researchers found that Maqian fruit essential oil (MQEO) reduced LPS-stimulated expression of TLR4 in THP-1 cells and effectively suppressed the production of IL-1
 <italic>β</italic> and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> in a dose-dependent manner, and in the past, researchers found that curcumin and ellagic acid [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], which are naturally occurring plant phenols, exhibit anti-inflammatory activity by preventing I
 <italic>κ</italic>B degradation [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Linalool is the main component of the essential oil from the blossoms of 
 <italic>Citrus aurantium</italic> L. var. amara Engl (CAVAO) [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. It can suppress inflammatory symptoms by suppressing NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B P65 translocation. It blocks the phosphorylation of IKK and I
 <italic>κ</italic>B [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The anti-inflammatory effect of MQEO may also be related to the TLR4-mediated NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B signalling pathway. These two kinds of traditional Chinese medicine essential oils have very good prospects in intestinal inflammatory diseases.
