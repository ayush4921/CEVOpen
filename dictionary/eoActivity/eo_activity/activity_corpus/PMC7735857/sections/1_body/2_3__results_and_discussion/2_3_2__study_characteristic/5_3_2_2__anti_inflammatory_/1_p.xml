<p>For in vivo tests of essential oils of traditional Chinese medicine with respect to anti-inflammatory diseases, most articles reported the use of chemical reagents to induce inflammation. Essential oils of Chinese medicine have inhibitory effects on inflammation induced by chemical agents. They play inhibitory roles in inflammatory diseases such as skin inflammation and intestinal inflammation, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) [

 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. After 4 hours of skin exposure to TPA, COX-2 expression in the skin increased significantly, and ear thickness increased significantly. Histological analysis of mouse ear slices can be used to observe the occurrence of inflammation. Skin oedema after successful modelling is obvious, showing many infiltrating neutrophils. This ear oedema model is an ideal in vivo model for screening anti-inflammatory drugs. The essential oils from
