<p>Mast cells play important roles in allergic inflammation [
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The essential oil from 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum coreanum</italic> Nakai (ZCO) has been shown to effectively inhibit mast cell degranulation and reduce the level of IL-4, a key inflammatory factor in allergy symptoms [
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Thirty-seven active ingredients identified from ZCO, mainly 
 <italic>ß</italic>-ocimene and (-)-
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene, can alleviate allergic inflammation by suppressing the MAPK and NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B signalling pathways. ZCO has good transdermal absorbability [
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and will likely be used to treat allergic inflammation in the future.
