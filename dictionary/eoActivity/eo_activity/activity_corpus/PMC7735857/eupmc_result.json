    "<h4>Background</h4>Inflammation is a host defense mechanism in the body after it is infected and damaged. If inflammation is not treated in time, then it may cause a variety of diseases, such as cancer and autoimmune diseases. Herbal essential oils are natural extracts that can suppress inflammation effectively and are expected to be used in therapeutic drugs for anti-inflammatory diseases in the future. <i>Aim of the review</i>. We review the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of essential oils derived from 16 herbs. <i>Materials and methods</i>. We searched the literature of the fields of anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory herbal essential oil activity published in English within the past five years via databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and The Web of Science).<h4>Results</h4>A total of 1932 papers were found by searching, and 132 papers were screened after removing duplicates and reading article titles. Fifteen articles met the requirements to be included in this review. Among those selected, 11 articles reported in vivo research results, and 10 articles showed research results.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Essential oils extracted from herbs can reduce inflammation by regulating the release of inflammatory cytokines involved in multiple signalling pathways. Herbal essential oils are expected to be developed as anti-inflammatory drugs."
