<p>Currently, diarrhea is one of the prominent root causes of mortality among children in the age group of 0–5 years. Attempts have been made to discover new drugs with minimal side effects on the other organs of the body. In developing nations, attention has been devoted to identifying novel phytochemicals derived from medicinal plants to develop new drugs with minimal side effects [

A number of therapeutic treatments are available for treating diarrhea in the form of synthetic drugs which cause many side effects in the human body, such as constipation, intestinal obstruction, induction of bronchospasm, and vomiting [

 <xref rid="B67-foods-10-00752" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. To combat these side effects, focus should be directed to investigate and isolate potent bioactive compounds from medicinal plants. GLs are considered to possess antidiarrheal properties, as reported by many researchers. Mazumdar et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-foods-10-00752" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] reported the antidiarrheal potential of ethanolic isolates of GLs in Wistar rats. The authors reported that a dosage level of extracts at a concentration of 750 and 500 mg/kg had antidiarrheal potential in castor oil-fed rats. Besides this, Ojewole et al. [
 <xref rid="B68-foods-10-00752" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] reported similar activity using aqueous extracts of GLs in rodents. They reported that GL extracts at doses of 52–410 mg/kg when administrated orally were found to combat diarrhea, and also resulted in reduced intestinal transit and dilatory removal of unwanted gastric products. Further, loperamide (13 mg/kg, p.o.) reduced the occurrence of defecation, along with the severity of diarrhea in the same animal models. The GL extracts reduced diarrheal symptoms, such as secretion of interstitial fluid and wetness of fecal droppings in a dose-dependent manner. GLs at different concentrations in rabbits showed concentration-dependent pulsing and pendulum retrenchments in the duodenum. These studies suggested that GLs possess excellent potential to combat diarrhea and they have gained the focus of scientific communities regarding their pharmacological prospects in different communities. In another study, Dewi et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-foods-10-00752" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] proved the antidiarrheal potency of GL water extracts. The authors used the combination of GL water extract (G) and green tea leaf extract (T). The extracts were used in different combinations, i.e., (G:T) 112.5:110.55, (G:T) 75:221.1, and (G:T) 37.5:331.65 mg/kg body weight. The outcomes proved that all combinations had potent antidiarrheal activities, depicted by enhanced stool weight, stool onset, stool consistency, and diarrhea period. When mice were administered with a water extract of (G:T) 75:221.1 at a time interval of 180–240 min, a significant reduction in diarrhea was observed. Based on the above observations, it can be concluded that GLs demonstrated potent antidiarrheal efficacy. It may interesting to investigate, in future, the associated underlying molecular mechanism/s and also long-term toxicity studies in different animal models, as well as in human patients, to ascertain the therapeutic efficacy and safety.
