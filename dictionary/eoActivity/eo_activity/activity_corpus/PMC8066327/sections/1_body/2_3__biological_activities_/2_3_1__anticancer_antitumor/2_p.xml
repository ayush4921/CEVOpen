<p>The growth of colorectal tumors chiefly relies on angiogenesis, a process by which new blood vessels develop from pre-existing ones. Prolonged angiogenesis is vital for the progression of tumors towards malignancy since the blood vessels efficiently supply the developing tumor cells with vital metabolites and oxygen and it also functions as an efficient means for cellular waste disposal. A study was conducted to investigate the anticancer and antiangiogenic potential of GL extracts against angiogenesis-dependent colorectal cancer [
 <xref rid="B50-foods-10-00752" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Guava leaf extracts rich in vitamin E, flavonoids (apigenin), and β-caryophyllene demonstrated strong antiproliferative activity against human colon carcinoma cell lines Caco-2, HT-29, and SW480. The antiangiogenic property of β-caryophyllene is attributable to its interaction with the transcription factor HIF-1α that regulates the biological pathways related to hypoxia, tumor metastasis, and tumor-mediated angiogenesis. HIF-1α also mediates the transcription of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the presence of β-caryophyllene, explaining the antiangiogenic and anticolorectal cancer property of guava leaf extract.
