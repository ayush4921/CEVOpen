 <xref rid="B40-foods-10-00752" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] reported the presence of flavonoids such as quercetin, kaempferol, guaijaverin, avicularin, myricetin, hyperin, and apigenin in guava leaf extract. Additionally, these flavonoids contributed to inhibitory action against α-glucosidase and α-amylase. It could be concluded from the study that the presence of the –OH group on the third position of the flavonoid was responsible for the inhibitory action. The inhibitory actions of myricetin, quercetin, and kaempferol against α-glucosidase and α-amylase were the highest, but a synergistic effect was quite evident. The presence of glycosides is essential to carry out the inhibitory function. Administration of ethanol extracts of guava leaves in the diet of rabbits brought about a significant reduction in the levels of serum triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein, with alleviated high-density lipoprotein levels [
