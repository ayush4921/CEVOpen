<p>A caryophyllene-based meroterpenoid called guajadial from GLs was studied for its antiproliferative and antiestrogenic activities against human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 BUS and MCF-7 [
 <xref rid="B51-foods-10-00752" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The authors suggested that guajadial exerts its anticancer activity by acting on estrogenic receptors, induction of apoptosis by blocking DNA synthesis, and inhibition of the cell cycle at the G1 phase [

 <italic>O</italic>-(6′-
 <italic>O</italic>-galloyl-β-D-glucopyranosyl)-benzophenone, isolated from guava leaves inhibited the growth of HCT116 human colon cancer cells [
 <xref rid="B53-foods-10-00752" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. These compounds strongly induced cancer cell apoptosis and modulated the expression of key proteins like extracellular signal-related kinases (p-ERK1/2), p53, c-Jun NH
 <sub>2</sub>-terminal kinases (p-JNK), and cleaved caspases 8 and 9, which are involved in apoptotic signaling and cell proliferation. Another study indicated the inhibitor effect of guava leaf extracts on lung cancer genes, primarily involved in signaling pathways like PI3K-Akt [
 <xref rid="B10-foods-10-00752" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The authors stated that daidzein, ursolic acid, apigenin, genistein, and quercetin in the leaf extract strongly inhibited cyclin-dependent kinase 2,6 (CDK2,6), vitamin D
 <sub>3</sub> receptor (VDR), hepatocyte growth factor receptor (MET), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), progesterone receptor (PGR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) proteins and subsequently blocked tumor proliferation and migration, tumor angiogenesis, tumor adhesion, and degradation of the extracellular matrix.
