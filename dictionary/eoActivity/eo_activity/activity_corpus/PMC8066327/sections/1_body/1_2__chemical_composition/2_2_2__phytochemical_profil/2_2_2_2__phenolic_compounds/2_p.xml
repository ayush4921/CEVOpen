<p>Among phenolic compounds, quercetin is a major bioactive phenolic compound in GLs. Diets enriched with bioactive compounds have been gaining much attention in recent years due to their potential to lower the risk of the development of numerous chronic diseases. Seven pure compounds, quercetin, avicularin, apigenin, guaijaverin, kaempferol, hyperin, and myricetin, were separated from the ethyl acetate (EtOAc)-soluble GL fraction using Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography with reversed-phase thin layer chromatography (RP-TLC) to monitor separation. Mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy were used to elucidate the compound structures [

 <xref rid="B43-foods-10-00752" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] extracted and analyzed phenolic compounds from non-fermented guava leaves (NFGLs) and fermented guava leaves (FGLs) using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization quadropole–time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC–TOF–ESI/MS). The authors reported the presence of gallic acid, rutin, chlorogenic acid, avicularin, isoquercitrin, quercitrin, and kaempferol in NFGL and FGL samples. Among them, quercetin, rutin, gallic acid, avicularin, and isoquercitrin occupied about 65% of the total peak area on the chromatogram. Another study reported higher concentrations of catechin (2.25%) and epicatechin (1.45%), whereas gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, quercetin, caffeic acid, and epigallocatechin gallate were present in lower concentrations in GL extract [

 <xref rid="B45-foods-10-00752" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], from GLs by HPLC–fluorimetric detector (FLD)–ESI–MS and studied their degree of polymerization in different oxidation states. Thus, the phytochemical profile of GL extract depicts the presence of numerous phytochemicals with distinct medicinal properties, suggesting its application to cure human diseases.
