<p>Recent articles have shown that plant byproducts, such as fruit or vegetable pomace, seeds, husk/bran/seed coat, peel, and leaves, are important source of bioactive compounds and can be utilized as functional food ingredients [

Numerous reports suggest the beneficial effects of the inclusion of GL extract in food as a functional food ingredient, because of the presence of a myriad of compounds like rutin, naringenin, gallic acid, catechin, epicatechin, kaempferol, isoflavonoids, vitamins, citric acid, and flavonoids such as quercetin and guaijaverin, which are well known for their antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory actions [
 <xref rid="B100-foods-10-00752" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. A study on the hypoglycemic effects of GL extract, due to the presence of its phenolic compounds, were shown to improve vascular dysfunction in mice with diet-induced obesity [
 <xref rid="B101-foods-10-00752" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Recently, GL extract has been used in the preparation of jelly with pectin and was subjected to mass spectrometry analysis, which verified the presence of quercetin, gallocatechin, esculin, 3-sinapoylquinic acid, ellagic acid, gallic acid, and citric acid that are responsible for antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. Additionally, the addition of GL did not cause any change in the texture properties of the jelly [
 <xref rid="B102-foods-10-00752" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. The potentiality of GL as a functional immunostimulant ingredient in fortified foods, owing to the presence of a high level of antioxidant and phenolic compounds, was also studied in detail [

Another study on the evaluation of food–drug interactions of guava leaf tea (GLT), which is a functional food and beverage that is commercially available in Japan, showed no possibility of interactions between GLT and medicines, indicating the safety of GLT in terms of food–drug interactions. Borderline diabetics, who are at high risk of the development of diabetes, take GLT to suppress a rapid increase in blood sugar level after meals. GLT consists of carbohydrate and dietary polyphenols which bind to digestive enzymes and are known to contribute to health through poor absorption of dietary sugar or lipids [

Another study on the addition of yellow strawberry GLs with abundant phenolic and flavonoid compounds in the diet of laying hens showed antimicrobial and antioxidant effects which could enhance the quality of eggs through the mechanism of inhibiting the pathways of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX), which plays a fundamental role as an inflammatory mediator [
 <xref rid="B105-foods-10-00752" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. In addition, the natural antioxidants present in GLs after fortification in fresh pork sausage were found to be effective in decelerating the process of lipid oxidation in the fresh pork sausage [
 <xref rid="B63-foods-10-00752" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. These examples indicate that GL is an excellent source of active compounds for functional ingredient additives in foods, without altering the rheological and sensory properties.
