 <p>The effects of fennel seed extract and its active compound 
  <italic>trans</italic>‐Anethole were investigated in the STZ‐induced liver injury in rats. Both fennel and 
  <italic>trans</italic>‐Anethole effectively reduced blood glucose levels, food and water intake, and intensity of weight loss during the treatment. Also, both fennel and 
  <italic>trans</italic>‐Anethole improved the serum lipid profile, decreased serum aminotransferases, attenuated liver tissue oxidative damage, and reduced liver fibrosis in diabetic rats.
