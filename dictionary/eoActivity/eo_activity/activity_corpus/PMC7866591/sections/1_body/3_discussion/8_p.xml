<p>Our histopathological findings showed that fennel and TA reduced liver damage and dysfunction in diabetic rats. It seems that fennel and TA reduced hepatic tissue inflammation by inhibiting neutrophilic accumulation and the generation of free radicals. The influx of fatty acids into hepatocytes due to hyperinsulinemia in diabetes is more than the capacity of excretion of protein, such as apolipoprotein B of hepatocytes. This change is indicative of the formation of fatty liver (Mantena et al.,

 <xref rid="fsn32090-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). We also detected that STZ injection led to perisinusoidal fibrosis and increased collagenous material. Five‐week treatment with TA and fennel (in both doses) reduced the fibrotic area. TA more effectively reduced hepatic fibrosis compared to fennel and metformin. The anti‐fibrotic effects of TA, in addition to the hypoglycemic effect, also maybe are related to the estrogen‐like properties (Albert‐Puleo,

 <xref rid="fsn32090-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). There is increasing clinical and experimental evidence indicating that estrogen plays a role in glucose homeostasis and reduces the complications of diabetes, such as fibrosis (Bissell, 
 <xref rid="fsn32090-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>; Mankhey et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32090-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>; Maric et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32090-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>; Yasuda et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32090-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>). TA has been reported to exert estrogenic activity (Dhar, 
 <xref rid="fsn32090-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">1995</xref>), and therefore, it is possible that a part of the anti‐diabetic effects of TA may arise from its estrogenic activity; however, more studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis. Moreover, we have not investigated the exclusive markers of fibrosis such as collagen I, fibronectin, and α‐SMA, and therefore, further studies are needed to determine the exact anti‐fibrotic mechanism of fennel and TA.
