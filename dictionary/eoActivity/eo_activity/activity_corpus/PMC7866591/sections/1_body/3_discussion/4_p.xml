<p>Despite the decrease in FBS levels in the fennel‐treated diabetic groups compared with the diabetic rats, water intake and urinary glucose excretion rate was still high and was not significantly different from the diabetic group. This indicates that a part of the hypoglycemic effect of fennel may be due to increased urinary excretion of glucose. Furthermore, in the TA‐treated diabetic rats, there was also a significant decrease in FBS levels. However, unlike fennel, TA was significantly water intake and reduced glucose excretion rate compared to the nontreated diabetic rats, as well as fennel and metformin‐treated diabetic rats. This may indicate that TA reduced blood glucose with a different path. Sheikh et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32090-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">2015</xref> suggested that the hyperglycemia ameliorating effect of TA is mediated by regulating the key enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism in STZ‐induced diabetic rats (Sheikh et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32090-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Since TA is an active ingredient in fennel, a part of the beneficial effects of fennel extract in lowering blood glucose could be mediated through this mechanism.
