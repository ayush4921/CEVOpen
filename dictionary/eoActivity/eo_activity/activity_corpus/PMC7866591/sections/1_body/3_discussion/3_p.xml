<p>Lack of insulin in the STZ‐injected rats led to severe weight loss and elevated serum glucose levels, consistent with previous reports (Vural et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32090-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>). Fennel administration induced a potent reduction of FBS levels, food intake, and the intensity of weight loss compared to diabetic rats. Treatment with 400 mg/kg fennel and TA reduced FBS more significantly compared to metformin. Several mechanisms have been suggested for the blood‐glucose‐lowering effect of fennel, including effects on energy metabolism and increase of insulin secretion from remaining pancreatic cells (Anitha et al.,
