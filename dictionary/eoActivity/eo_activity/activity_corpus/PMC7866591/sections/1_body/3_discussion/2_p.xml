<p>The findings of the present study showed that in the STZ‚Äêinduced diabetic rats, morphological and biochemical alterations occurred in the liver tissue. Due to the STZ injection, serum glucose levels and glucose excretion rates were significantly increased, and therefore, water and food intake increased, and severe weight loss occurred. Treatment of diabetic rats with fennel, TA, or metformin reduced the blood glucose levels and the intensity of weight loss, normalized the serum lipid profile, and attenuated the liver damage and oxidative stress in the liver tissue of the diabetic rats.</p>
