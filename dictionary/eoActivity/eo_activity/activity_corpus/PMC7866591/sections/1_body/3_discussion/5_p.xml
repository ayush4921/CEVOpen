<p>Our findings also revealed that in the STZ‐induced diabetic rats, treatment with both fennel and TA significantly normalized the serum lipid profile by reducing the TG, TC, LDL‐c and increasing the HDL‐c levels. It has been reported that treatment with fennel extract leads to the recovery of the lipid profiles to normal levels in STZ‐induced diabetic rats (Anitha et al.,

Additionally, fennel has been reported to increase the serum insulin levels and therefore normalize the serum lipid profile in diabetic rats (Anitha et al.,
