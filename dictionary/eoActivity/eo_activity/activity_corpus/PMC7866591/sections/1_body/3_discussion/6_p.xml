<p>We determined the serum aminotransferase (ALT, AST) levels to evaluate the hepatic function. As shown in Table‐2, the AST and ALT levels were significantly increased in the STZ‐injected rats. AST and ALT are the cytosolic and mitochondrial enzymes of hepatocytes. The increase in serum ALT and AST levels may be due to the cellular damage in the liver caused by the direct toxic effect of STZ or hyperglycemia induced by it (Guven et al.,

 <xref rid="fsn32090-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>). In previous reports, a positive relationship between serum aminotransferase levels and the risk of diabetes has been reported in humans (Song et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32090-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). In line with our findings, also an elevated level of serum AST and ALT (3–4 fold) has been reported in the animal model of diabetes (Ramachandran &amp; Saravanan, 
 <xref rid="fsn32090-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Zafar et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32090-bib-0053" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). In both fennel‐ and TA‐treated rats, aminotransferase levels were significantly reduced. As a result of liver cell damage and the disruption of the plasma membrane, AST and ALT are released and lead to the elevation of serum aminotransferase levels (McGill, 
 <xref rid="fsn32090-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). We showed that fennel and TA attenuated hyperglycemia and resulted liver injury, as evidenced by the histopathological and biochemical assessments. Therefore, fennel and TA, maybe by the protection of the hepatocyte against hyperglycemia‐induced cell injury, were able to reduce liver enzyme levels in the serum.
