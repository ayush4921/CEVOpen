<p>Our findings indicated that the administration of fennel or its active component TA is able to protect the liver against STZ‚Äêinduced diabetes in rats. They are also able to ameliorate blood glucose levels and normalize lipid profile in serum. A part of the therapeutic effects of fennel extract and TA is possibly through the hypoglycemic properties of them. Additionally, they may directly protect the liver through other mechanisms such as antioxidant effects. Overall, these findings suggest that fennel or its active compound, TA, could be useful in the management of diabetes complications.</p>
