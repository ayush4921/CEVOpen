<p>Biomarkers of oxidative stress have been reported to increase in the liver at the early stage of STZ‐induced diabetes due to its main role in detoxifying and oxidative processes (Schmatz et al.,

Furthermore, chronic hyperglycemia can induce the autoxidation of glucose, activation of protein kinase C, hexosamine metabolism, sorbitol formation, formation and glycation of methylglyoxal, and oxidative phosphorylation, which all are involved in the generation of ROS in the liver (Goswami &amp; Chatterjee,
