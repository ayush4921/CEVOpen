<p>Oxidative stress occurs when the balance between the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant defense systems is impaired (Hosseinian et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32090-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). In diabetes, ROS is generated via different mechanisms and multiple sources, including the enzymatic pathway, nonenzymatic pathway, and also mitochondrial respiratory chain reactions (Palsamy et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32090-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). Hyperglycemia directly induces oxidative stress through the glycation of proteins, autoxidation of glucose, and the enhancement of the mitochondrial production of superoxide anion (Dias et al.,

 <xref rid="fsn32090-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Moreover, increased levels of free fatty acids (FFA) in diabetes may also have a role in ROS production since mitochondrial uncoupling and β‐oxidation were increased (King &amp; Loeken,
