<p>TA [1‐Methoxy‐4‐(E)‐propenyl‐benzene] is an active compound present in the essential oil of fennel seeds (Fang et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32090-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). Previous studies have reported that TA exhibits various pharmacological activities, such as antioxidant, anti‐diabetic, cardioprotective, anti‐inflammatory, anti‐cancer, and estrogenic effects (Anitha et al.,
