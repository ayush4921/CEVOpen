<p>Rats were randomized into six groups (

 <xref rid="fsn32090-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Diabetes induction was done by the intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of STZ (65 mg/kg body) (Park et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32090-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). 72 hr after STZ injection, rats with fasting blood glucose (FBS) levels greater than 250 mg/dl and glycosuria were considered diabetic. Diabetic rats were treated with fennel extract (200 and 400 mg/kg) (Hassanpour et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32090-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>), TA (80 mg/kg) (Sheikh et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32090-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>) or metformin (300 mg/kg) (Ghatak et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32090-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>) for 35 days. All rats were allowed free access to water and rat chow. The rats were monitored weekly for food and water intake and for body weight. Blood and urine samples were collected on the 0th, 21st, and 35th days.
