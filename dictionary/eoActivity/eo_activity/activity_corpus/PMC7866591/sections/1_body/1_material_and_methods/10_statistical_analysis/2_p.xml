<p>The sample size required for the experiment was estimated using G*power software (v3.1.9.7), considering FBS levels at the end of the study as a primary outcome based on our pilot study results. Considering statistical power = 0.95 and α = 0.05, the minimum sample size was estimated 5–6 animals per group. The analyses were carried out using SPSS software (version 16). One‐way ANOVA was run, and then, Tukey's post hoc test was used to compare the differences between the groups. All data were expressed as mean ±
