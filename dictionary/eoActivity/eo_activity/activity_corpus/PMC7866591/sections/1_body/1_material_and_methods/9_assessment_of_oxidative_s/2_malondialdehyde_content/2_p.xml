<p>The concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) was measured as an index of lipid peroxidation in the liver tissues. Briefly, the liver tissues were weighted and homogenized with ice‐cold phosphate buffer saline (PBS). 1 ml of the supernatant of homogenized samples was mixed with 1 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid and 1 ml of 0.67% thiobarbituric acid. The samples were heated in a boiling water bath for 15 min and centrifuged at 1,000 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min. Then, the supernatants were collected, and the absorbance was read at 535 nm.
