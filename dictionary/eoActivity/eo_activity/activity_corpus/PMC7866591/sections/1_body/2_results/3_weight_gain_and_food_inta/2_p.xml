<p>As shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32090-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>, food intake in diabetic rats was significantly increased compared to the control rats (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). During the study, control rats gained weight; in contrast, diabetic rats lost as expected (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32090-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). Treatment with TA, fennel (in both doses), and metformin significantly prevented weight loss during the study (all, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and reduced food intake compared to the STZ group (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 ‐ 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001); however, none of them reached to the control level. No significant differences were also observed between the treatment groups (Figure
