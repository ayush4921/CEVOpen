<p>All STZ‐injected rats developed severe hyperglycemia (&gt;300 mg/dl) in the three days after STZ injection (day 0 of the experiment), and FBS level was gradually increased (up to 600 mg/dl) until the last day of the experiment in the nontreated rats compared to the control group (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). In the STZ‐injected rats, which received oral administration of fennel (200 and 400 mg/kg), TA, or metformin FBS levels were significantly reduced (&lt;400 mg/dl) (all, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) compared to the STZ group (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32090-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). TA and fennel 400 mg/kg were more effective in reducing the FBS levels compared to the fennel 200 mg/kg and metformin groups (

 <xref rid="fsn32090-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). As expected, water intake in the STZ‐injected rats increased almost 15‐fold compared to the control animals (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32090-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Interestingly, while fennel treatment reduced the FBS levels, it did not reduce and even slightly increased water intake compared to the STZ group. On the other hand, TA significantly reduced water intake compared to the STZ group (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32090-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Glucose excretion rate (GER) was also investigated, and the results showed a significant increase in the GER in the STZ group compared to the control group (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32090-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Since TA significantly reduced FBS and water intake, glycosuria was also reduced in this group (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), but while fennel reduced FBS, however, GER was not decreased in fennel‐treated rats compared to the STZ group (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32090-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>).
