<p>The histopathological findings of control rats revealed normal liver histology and structure (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32090-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Liver sections of the diabetic rats (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32090-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>) showed significant necrosis in most of the hepatocytes, increased monocyte infiltration, congested and dilated sinusoids, and thickening of the portal vein wall. Most hepatocytes of liver tissue from diabetic rats treated with TA (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32090-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>) appeared normal, but some signs of congested blood vein still were observed. Diabetic rats treated with fennel (200 mg/kg) showed improvement in some signs of hepatocyte necrosis and inflammation, but disarrangements of hepatocyte cords and dilated sinusoids were observed (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32090-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). The liver tissue of diabetic rats treated with fennel (400 mg/kg) appeared normal histological structure and mild sinusoid dilation (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32090-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>). In diabetic rats treated with metformin, improvements in hepatocyte arrangement and monocyte infiltration were observed, but a congested and dilated portal vein was shown (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32090-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>).
