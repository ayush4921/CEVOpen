<p>As shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32090-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, the concentration of MDA was significantly increased in the liver tissues of the diabetic rats than those of the control rats (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The MDA level in the diabetic rats treated with 400 mg/kg fennel, TA, as well as metformin was significantly decreased compared to the diabetic group (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, and 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, respectively), but it was not reduced to the control level (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32090-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). The antioxidant system was also significantly weakened in the liver tissues of the nontreated diabetic rats, as evidenced by a decreased level of thiol content and activity of SOD and CAT enzymes (all, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32090-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2b–d</xref>). Treatment of diabetic rats with fennel 200 and 400 mg/kg, TA and metformin significantly improved the total thiol content (

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 and 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, respectively). Both TA and fennel in 400 mg/kg doses were significantly more efficient in improving the thiol content of the liver when compared to the fennel 200 mg/kg and metformin groups (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 and 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32090-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). In all treatment groups, SOD activity was significantly lower than the control group (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), and although TA and fennel 400 mg/kg slightly increased SOD activity, but none of the treatments were able to significantly improve SOD activity compared to the STZ group. However, CAT activity was significantly improved in the STZ‐TA, STZ‐F200, STZ‐400, and STZ‐Met groups compared to the STZ group (
