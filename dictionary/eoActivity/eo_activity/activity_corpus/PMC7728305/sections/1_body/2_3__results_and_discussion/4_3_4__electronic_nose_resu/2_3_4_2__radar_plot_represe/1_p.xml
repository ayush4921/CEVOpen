<p>Radar-plots with unitary radius were used to observe whether pattern differences (i.e., fingerprints) developed between essential oil samples. As can be seen, the radar plots (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-20-06750-f006">Figure 6</xref>) show a clear variation between two essential oils (okoume, aiele). To construct these plots, the values of delta G for the sensor responses were divided by the value corresponding to sensor TGS 825, which showed the maximum signal. This helped to visualize the differences among typical response patterns. Indeed, a clear pattern variation (fingerprint) exists between okoume and aiele, which confirms the ability of the e-nose to easily discriminate between the two types of essential oils using the radar plot representation.
