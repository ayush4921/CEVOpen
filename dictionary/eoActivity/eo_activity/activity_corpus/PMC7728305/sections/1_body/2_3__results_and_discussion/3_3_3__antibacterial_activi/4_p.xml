<p>The antimicrobial activity of both essential oils (Okoume and Aiele) against the (Gram−) bacteria could be associated to the presence of monoterpenes (α-terpinene (1-methyl-4-propan-2-ylcyclohexa-1,3-diene)), 4-carene ((1R,4S,6S)-4,7,7-trimethylbicyclo[4.1.0]hept-2-ene), 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (1-methyl-4-propan-2-ylbenzene), (+)-3-Carene (3,7,7-trimethyl bicyclo[4.1.0]hept-3-ene). Previous studies indicated that these compounds have synergistic antibacterial activity. Another study [

 <italic>Glossogyne tenuifolia</italic>, and its various compounds (including 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (1-methyl-4-propan-2-ylbenzene)) against some common food pathogens. 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (1-methyl-4-propan-2-ylbenzene) was found to be the most common compound in this oil. A minimum bactericidal concentration of 12 mg/mL of 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (1-methyl-4-propan-2-ylbenzene) completely inhibited 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7, and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> showed a minimum microbicidal concentration of 6 mg/mL, in addition 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (1-methyl-4-propan-2-ylbenzene) can induce significant synergistic antibacterial activity with other compounds such as limonene and α-terpinene. That increased the antibacterial effect against pathogenic bacteria [

In addition, the low sensitivity of Gram− bacteria compared to the Gram+ bacteria found for both essential oils is probably due to the presence of an external lipopolysaccharide membrane that acts as a physical barrier to lipophilic compounds, including essential oils [
 <xref rid="B72-sensors-20-06750" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Further studies on the combination of these essential oils with conventional antibiotics are needed to offer a promising and significant potential for the development of new therapies in the treatment of infectious diseases caused by multi-resistant microorganisms.
