<p>An inhibitory effect for both strains was also observed for aiele essential oil. The literature shows that the presence of oxygenated monoterpenes, including 1, 8-cineole, linalool, -terpineol, nerolidol, and spathulenol, in high proportions results in antibacterial properties [
 <xref rid="B60-sensors-20-06750" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The essential oil of aiele is composed of relatively low proportions of some of these compounds and has been reported to show inhibitory activity. These reports are consistent with the results presented here. In particular, essential oils consist of complex mixtures of many constituents. The possible synergistic effects of the constituents present in the essential oil must also be taken into account. As mentioned above, okoume and aiele essential oils have a strong antimicrobial activity against these two bacteria: 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (Gram+) and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (Gram−). According to GC-MS results, okoume essential oil contains a high percentage of d-Limonene ((4R)-1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-yl-cyclohexene) (19.36%), which is absent in aiele essential oil. This compound is considered to be the most toxic against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> in comparison to other terpenes present [
 <xref rid="B61-sensors-20-06750" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. A similar finding was reported for d-limonene-containing nano-emulsion, where 12.5 μg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> was required to inhibit 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, whereas Gram+ 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> bacteria required only 3.125 μg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> [
 <xref rid="B62-sensors-20-06750" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Our results confirm a higher antibacterial effect of okoume on 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> compared to Gram− bacteria (
 <italic>E. coli</italic>). This can also explain the strong sensitivity of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (Gram+) to Okoume and not to Aiele essential oil. Generally, the main antimicrobial active components, act against the cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria cell. The main mechanisms of action of okoume essential oil compounds (d-limonene (((4R)-1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-yl-cyclohexene), p-cymene (1-methyl-4-propan-2-ylbenzene) and 3-carene (3,7,7-trimethyl bicyclo[4.1.0]hept-3-ene)) are as follows. D-limonene ((4R)-1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene) acts against the cytoplasmic membranes of microorganisms, resulting in loss of membrane integrity, thus modifying its permeability and leading to the leakage of certain cellular components such as ions and proteins, dissipation of proton motive force and inhibition of respiratory enzymes [
 <xref rid="B63-sensors-20-06750" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Cymene can also cause an expansion of the cytoplasmic membrane, inducing a reduction of the membrane potential. Another study [
 <xref rid="B64-sensors-20-06750" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] suggested that the antimicrobial effects of p-cymene (1-methyl-4-propan-2-ylbenzene) may be due to a disruption of lipids in the bacterial membrane. p-cymene (1-methyl-4-propan-2-ylbenzene) may also have an impact on protein synthesis and cell motility, which was recently studied in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7 [
 <xref rid="B65-sensors-20-06750" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Morphological changes induced by p-cymene (1-methyl-4-propan-2-ylbenzene) treatment have also been studied, showing damage in the morphological structure of the cell [
 <xref rid="B66-sensors-20-06750" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Similarly, 3-carene (3,7,7-trimethyl bicyclo[4.1.0]hept-3-ene) can damage the cell wall and cell membrane of Gram+ and Gram− bacteria, leading to leakage of protoplasmic contents [
 <xref rid="B67-sensors-20-06750" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] and reduction of proteins [
 <xref rid="B68-sensors-20-06750" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. This, in turn, kills the bacteria and causes rapid degradation of ATP. Previous studies indicate that the sharp decrease in bacterial ATP concentration with the addition of 3-carene (3,7,7-trimethyl bicyclo[4.1.0]hept-3-ene) could be due to the inhibition of ATP synthesis, increased ATP hydrolysis, and interruption of biofilm structure, confirming damage to bacterial energy metabolism and biosynthetic pathways [
