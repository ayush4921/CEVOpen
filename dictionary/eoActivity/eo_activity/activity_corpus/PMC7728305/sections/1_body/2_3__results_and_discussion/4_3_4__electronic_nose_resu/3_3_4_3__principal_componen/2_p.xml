 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-20-06750-f008">Figure 8</xref> shows a biplot for the PCA analysis for the first two principal components. In the biplot, scores for the two essential oils correspond to the black symbols, and the loadings are represented by the red and blue symbols. The plot suggests that the information given by the slope (+) and the normalized conductance change (*) is somewhat anti-correlated, as their associated loadings appear at an angle of about 180 degrees across the center. In contrast, the information given by the area under the response curve (o) is somewhat orthogonal to both the information given by the slope and conductance change, as their loadings appear at an angle of about 90 degrees across the center. The loadings varied significantly from sensor to sensor, so it can be concluded that the six sensors used are useful for achieving a good discrimination performance.
