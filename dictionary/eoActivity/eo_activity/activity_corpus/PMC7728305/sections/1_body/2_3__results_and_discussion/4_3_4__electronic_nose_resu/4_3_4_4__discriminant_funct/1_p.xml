<p>The performance of the e-nose system in the classification of essential oil samples into two groups was evaluated applying DFA method. These groups correspond to those also separated by PCA. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-20-06750-f009">Figure 9</xref> shows the DFA performed on two types of essential oils, okoume and aiele. We can see from this figure that all samples are perfectly separated from each other. These results confirm that the e-nose system was able to discriminate different types of essential oils that come from the same family plants.
