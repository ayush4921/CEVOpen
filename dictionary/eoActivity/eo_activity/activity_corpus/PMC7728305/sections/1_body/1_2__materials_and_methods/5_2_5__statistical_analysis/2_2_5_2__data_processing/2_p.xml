<p>Radar plots are particularly appropriate to illustrate the overall responses of the sensor system. A Radar plot is used to display the results generated by several sources and is strongly recommended when associated with a statistical study, since it frequently anticipates the classification of data groups. Unit radius radar plots were used in this study to check for differences between the two samples of okoume and aiele essential oils. This makes it easy to accurately visualize the differences between typical plots.</p>
