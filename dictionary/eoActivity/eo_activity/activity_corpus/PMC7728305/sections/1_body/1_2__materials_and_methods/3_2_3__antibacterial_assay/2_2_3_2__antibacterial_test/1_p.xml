<p>The antibacterial activity of different essential oils was evaluated by the aromatogram method [
 <xref rid="B52-sensors-20-06750" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Briefly, the test was performed in sterile Petri dishes (100 mm diameter), previously poured by media (Müller Hinton ((Sigma Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) for bacteria), seeded with a microbial suspension (107 cell/mL). Then, sterile 6 mm diameter Wattmen paper discs, soaked with 10 µL of each essential oil, were placed sterile on the surface of the culture media. After incubation for 24 h at 37 °C, the results are read by measuring the diameter, in mm, of the inhibition zone. All experiments were repeated three times [
