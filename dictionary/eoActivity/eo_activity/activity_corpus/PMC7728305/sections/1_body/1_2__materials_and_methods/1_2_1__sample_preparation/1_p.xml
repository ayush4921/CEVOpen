<p>In this paper, two types of Gabonese essential oils called okoume and aiele of the medicinal plant family Burseraceae, were used. 
 <italic>Aucoumea klaineana</italic> (okoume) and 
 <italic>Canarium schweinfurthii</italic> (aiele) resins were collected in March 2017 in Djoutou South East Gabon. The resins were hydro-distilled for 3 h in a Clevenger-type apparatus. The essential oils were dried after decantation using anhydrous sodium sulfate, then filtered and stored under dark conditions at 4 Â°C before analysis. The percentage yield of essential oils has been calculated on the basis of the ratio (mass of dry oil extracted to mass of resin).
