<p>The antibacterial activity was performed on two strains of Gram-negative (
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (ATCC 25922)) and Gram-positive (
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>) bacteria, obtained from the microbiology laboratory of the Faculty of Science, Moulay Ismail University of Meknes (Morocco). The bacteria to be tested were sown on Petri dishes containing selective media adapted to the bacterial strains used and incubated at 37 Â°C for 24 h to obtain well-isolated colonies. After this incubation time, 1 to 3 well isolated and perfectly identical bacterial colonies were collected using a platinum loop, then emulsified in a tube containing 2 mL of 0.9% sterile physiological water and vortexed. The inoculum was adjusted to 0.5 McFarland, corresponding to an optical density of (0.08 to 0.10) at 625 nm [
