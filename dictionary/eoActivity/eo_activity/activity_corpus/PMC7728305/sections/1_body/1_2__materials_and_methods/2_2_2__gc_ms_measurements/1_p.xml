<p>The chemical analysis of the volatile atmospheres resulting from the essential oils was carried out using GC-MS. The analyses employed two instruments, a GC series 6890 with liquid automatic sampler series HP7683 coupled to a mass spectrometer 5972 (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). The column used in chromatography was an HP5 analytical column (Agilent Technologies Inc.), with a length of 30 m, an internal diameter of 0.25 mm and a 0.25 μm thick stationary phase. In this case, the injections of the samples were done manually. The samples were weighed in vials of 10 mL. Subsequently, a manual injection syringe was introduced into the headspace and the volatile sample was injected into the GC. The analysis method was as follows: injector: splitless; inlet pressure: 11.03 psi; inlet temp. 220 °C; column flow 1.3 mL/min; mode: constant flow; volume: 500 μL; temperature: initial T: 60 °C, 2 min; ramp 3 °C/min up to 90 °C, 9 min; ramp 20 °C/min up to 220 °C, 2 min; Analysis time: 20.5 min; acquisition in full scan mode and range from 15 to 300

Volatile compounds were tentatively identified via comparison of the spectrum recorded and those in the database when a high degree of similarity was found (equal to or higher than 80%).
