<p>The experimental system is mainly composed of three parts: a sampling unit, the sensor array, and a data acquisition system. An overall view of the system is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-20-06750-f001">Figure 1</xref>. The data acquisition system registers the electrical signals generated from gas sensors due to the interaction of their sensitive surfaces with the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released from essential oils. Each sample was placed in a 100 mL airtight glass vial with two small holes in their cover to allow the headspace to be analyzed with the e-nose equipment. Six replicates of each essential oil headspace (okoume, aiele) sample were measured without any pre-treatment.
