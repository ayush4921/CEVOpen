<p>On the contrary, Methods C and D described a decarboxylation step (respectively, in the oven at 115°C for 40 min and 145°C for 30 min) before oil maceration with a full conversion of the acidic to neutral forms. Then, in Method C, the decarboxylated cannabis is extracted in oil heated by means of a water bath (100°C for 40 min), whereas in method D the extraction is carried out by ultrasound (35 kHz 30 min). In Method C, neutral forms of both THC and CBD were prevalently valued at 93% and 79%, respectively. Moreover, in Method D, the neutral forms covered almost the totality of the cannabinoids, THC 99%, and CBD 96.5%.</p>
