<p>The fluorimetric Morgan–Elson assay method was performed according to Reissig, et al. [
 <xref rid="B62-plants-10-00667" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] that modified by Takahashi, et al. [
 <xref rid="B63-plants-10-00667" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. In a brief description, a 5 μL of tested EOs and a mixture of EOs of the two plants (1:1,

 <italic>w</italic>), separately, were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with bovine hyaluronidase (1.50 U) in 100 μL of 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.0), sodium chloride (77 mM), in addition to 0.01% bovine serum albumin (BSA). The assay reaction was initiated via adding the hyaluronic acid sodium salt (100 μL) from rooster comb (0.03% in 300 mM sodium phosphate, pH 5.35) to the incubation mixture, then the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. The precipitation of undigested hyaluronic acid was carried out by 1 mL acidic solution of albumin, involving 0.1% BSA in sodium acetate (24 mM) and acetic acid (79 mM, pH 3.75). The mixture was stoped by allowing it for 10 min at room temperature, and fluorescence was detected using a Tecan Infinite microplate reader at 545 nm excitation and 612 nm emission EGCG was used as a positive control.
