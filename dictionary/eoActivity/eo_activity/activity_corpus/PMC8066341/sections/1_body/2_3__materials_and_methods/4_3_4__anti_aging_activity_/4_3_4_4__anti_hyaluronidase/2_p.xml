<p>The percentage of the collagenase, elastase, and hyaluronidase inhibition was calculated via the following equation:
 <disp-formula>Enzyme inhibition (%) = [1 − (
  <italic>S</italic>/
  <italic>C</italic>) × 100]
  <label>(2)</label>
 </disp-formula> where 
 <italic>S</italic>: the corrected absorbance of the samples containing elastase inhibitor (the enzyme activity in the presence of the samples); and 
 <italic>C</italic>: the corrected absorbance of controls (the enzyme activity in the absence of the samples).
