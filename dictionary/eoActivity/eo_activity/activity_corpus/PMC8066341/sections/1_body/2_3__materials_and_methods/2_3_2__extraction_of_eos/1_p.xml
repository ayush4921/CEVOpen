<p>The air-dried powder of the above-ground parts of the 
 <italic>P. dioscoridis</italic>, and 
 <italic>E. bonariensis</italic>, (200 gm, each) were subjected separately to Clevenger-type apparatuses using round flask (2.5 L) comtaining water (1.5 L) for hydro-distillation for 3 h. The oily layer of each plant was isolated separately by 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane, then dried using anhydrous Na
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> (0.5 g), and finally stored in glass vials in the freezer till further analysis via GC-MS. This extraction of the EO of each plant was repeated as duplicates.
