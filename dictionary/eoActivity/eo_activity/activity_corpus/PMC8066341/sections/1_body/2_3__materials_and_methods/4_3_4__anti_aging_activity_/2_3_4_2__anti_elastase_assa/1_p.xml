<p>For anti-elastase inhibitory assay the two studied plants EOs as well as the 1:1 mixture, this assay was performed according to Kim, et al. [
 <xref rid="B60-plants-10-00667" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] with minor modifications. Briefly; Porcine pancreatic elastase, was dissolved to make a 3.33 mg/mL stock solution in sterile water. The substrate, N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Ala-
 <italic>p</italic>-nitroanilide (AAAPVN) was dissolved in buffer at 1.6 mM. The test EOs were incubated with the enzyme for 15 min before adding substrate to begin the reaction. The final reaction mixture (250 μL total volume) contained buffer, 0.8 mM AAAPVN, 1 μg/mL PE and 25 μg test sample. The studied EOs and a mixture of EOs of the two plants (1:1,
