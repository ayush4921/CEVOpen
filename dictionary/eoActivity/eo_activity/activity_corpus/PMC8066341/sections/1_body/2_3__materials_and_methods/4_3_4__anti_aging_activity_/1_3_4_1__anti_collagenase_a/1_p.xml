<p>The anti-collagenase assay of the two studied plants EOs as well as the 1:1 mixture were performed according to Thring, et al. [
 <xref rid="B59-plants-10-00667" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] with minor modifications for use in a microplate reader. The assay was performed in 50 mM tricine buffer (pH 7.5) with 400 mM NaCl and 10 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub>. Collagenase from 
 <italic>Clostridium histolyticum</italic> (ChC–EC.3.4.23.3) was dissolved in a buffer for use at an initial concentration of 0.8 units/mL according to the supplier’s activity data. The synthetic substrate 
 <italic>N</italic>-[3-(2-furyl) acryloyl]-Leu-Gly-Pro-Ala (FALGPA) was dissolved in tricine buffer to 2 mM. Two studied EOs and the mixture of EOs of the two plants (1:1, 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>), separately, were incubated with the enzyme in a buffer for 15 min before adding substrate to start the reaction. Absorbance at 490 nm was measured using a Microplate reader (TECAN, Group Ltd., Männedorf, Switzerland). Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) was used as a positive control.
