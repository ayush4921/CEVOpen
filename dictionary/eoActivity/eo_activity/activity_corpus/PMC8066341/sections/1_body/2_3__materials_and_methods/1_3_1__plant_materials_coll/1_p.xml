<p>The above-ground parts of 
 <italic>P. dioscoridis</italic> and 
 <italic>E. bonariensis</italic>, were collected from two populations along the Cairoâ€“Alexandria desert road, Egypt in November 2019. From each population, the healthy and fresh plant samples were clipped from three individuals and pooled as composite samples (two per each plant; 
 <italic>P. dioscoridis</italic> and 
 <italic>E. bonariensis</italic>). The two plants were authenticated according to Tackholm [

 <xref rid="B25-plants-10-00667" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Voucher specimens (CZ-D-x908-019 &amp; CZ-L-x909-019) have been deposited in the herbarium of the National Research Center, Egypt. The above-ground parts were dried in the shade, ground into a fine powder, and packed in paper bags till further analysis [
