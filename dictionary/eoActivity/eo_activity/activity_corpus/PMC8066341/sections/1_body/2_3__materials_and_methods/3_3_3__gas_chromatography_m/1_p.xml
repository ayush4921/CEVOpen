<p>The four EOs samples (two samples for each plant) were analyzed via Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy (GC-MS) at National Research Center, Egypt [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-10-00667" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The adjustment of the GC/MS instrument specifications has occurred as the following conditions: TRACE GC Ultra Gas Chromatographs (THERMO Scientific™ Corporate, Waltham, MA, USA), lined with a Thermo Scientific ISQ™ EC single quadrupole mass spectrometer. The GC-MS system was equipped with a TR-5 MS column with a dimension of 30 m × 0.32 mm i.d., 0.25 μm film thickness. Helium as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min with a split ratio of 1:10 using the following temperature program: 60 °C for 1 min; rising at 4.0 °C/min to 240 °C and held for 1 min was used for the analyses. Both injector and detector were held at 210 °C. An aliquot of 1 μL of diluted samples in hexane (1:10, 
 <italic>v/v</italic>) was always injected. Mass spectra were recorded by electron ionization (EI) at 70 eV, using a spectral range of 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 40–450.
