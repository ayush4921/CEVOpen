<p>Assays of tyrosinase inhibition of the two plants EOs, as well as the 1:1 mixture, were carried out via measuring of L-DOPA chrome formation according to the described protocol of Batubara, et al. [
 <xref rid="B61-plants-10-00667" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Briefly, the two EOs and a mixture of them (1:1, 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>), separately, were dissolved in a solvent with three certain concentrations (10, 100, and 250 μg/mL). The assays were performed by insertion of the following components: (a) phosphate buffer (120 μL, 20 mM, pH 6.8), (b) 20 μL sample, and (c) 20 μL mushroom tyrosinase (500 U/mL in 20 mM phosphate buffer) in 96-well plates. After 15 min of incubation at 25 °C, the intiation of reaction was occurred by insertion of 20 μL L-tyrosine solution (0.85 mM) for every well and followed by incubation for 10 min at room temperature. The activity of the enzyme was monitored at 475 nm using a Microplate reader (TECAN, Inc.). EGCG was used as a positive control. The calculation of the tyrosinase inhibition % was performed via the following equation:
 <disp-formula>Tyrosinase inhibition (%) = [(A − B) − (C − D)]/(A−B) × 100
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula> where A is the absorbance of the control with the enzyme, B is the absorbance of the control without the enzyme, C is the absorbance of the test sample with the enzyme, and D is the absorbance of the test sample without the enzyme.
