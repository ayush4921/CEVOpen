<p>A matrix of the concentration of a total of 30 major chemical compounds (&gt;3%) identified in the EO of five 
 <italic>P. dioscoridis</italic> ecospecies was constructed, these samples were (1) present sample; (2) purchased from a market in Cairo, Egypt; (3) collected from El-Sadat City, Egypt; (4) collected from Cairo-Suez desert road, Egypt dring April; and (5) collected from Turkey. While for 
 <italic>E. bonariensis</italic>, a matrix of 27 major chemical compounds (&gt;3%) represented six samples was designed, these samples were (1) present sample; (2) collected from Alexandria, Egypt; (3) collected from Monastir, Tunisia; (4) collected from Venezuela; (5) collected from Vietnam; and (6) collected from India. The matrices were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) and agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) via XLSTAT statistical computer software package (version 2018, Addinsoft Inc., New York, NY, USA).
