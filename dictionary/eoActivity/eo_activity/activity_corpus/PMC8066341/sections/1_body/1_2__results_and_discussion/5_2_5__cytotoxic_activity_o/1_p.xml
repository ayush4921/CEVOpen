<p>The cytotoxicity of EOs of the above-ground parts of the two plants, 
 <italic>P. dioscoridis</italic> and 
 <italic>E. bonariensis</italic>, as well as a mixture of the two EOs (1:1) against the three cancer cell lines, breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF-7), lung cancer cells (A-549), and hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2) are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00667-f006">Figure 6</xref>. The results exhibited that the EO of 
 <italic>P. dioscoridis</italic> have a significant inhibition of the two cancer cells, MCF-7 and A-549, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 37.3 and 22.3 μM, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00667-f006">Figure 6</xref>A,B), without any activity against HepG2. While, the EO of the 
 <italic>E. bonariensis</italic> showed inhibitory potentiality only against HepG2 with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 25.6 μM (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00667-f006">Figure 6</xref>C), with negative results against MCF-7 and A-549. The 1:1 mixture of the two EOs did not exhibit any activity against the three cancer cells.
