<p>The constituents of EO of 
 <italic>P. dioscoridis</italic> were characterized by the presence of four classes of compounds including sesqui- (93.40%), and monoterpenes (0.19%), carotenoid derived compounds (0.28%) in addition to other acyclic compounds (1.33%). The terpenoids were found as abundant compounds with a relative concentration of 93.59% in addition to traces of carotenoids and acyclic compounds with a complete absence of diterpenoids. GC-MS analysis of EO derived from 
 <italic>E. bonariensis</italic>, revealed the presence of four categories of compounds comprising sesqui- (81.06%), and monoterpenes (14.16%), diterpenes (2.44%) in addition to other acyclic compounds (0.55%). Furthermore, the terpenoids were characterized as the main components by a relative concentration of 95.22% with traces of diterpenoids and other compounds. These results deduced the fact of the preponderance of the terpenoids in the different species of 
 <italic>Conyza</italic> genus [
