<p>The present data revealed that these two EOs are selective against the tested cancer cells. This selectivity was in full agreement with several documented results of EOs derived from other plants. For example, EO derived from 
 <italic>Sideritis perfoliata</italic>, 
 <italic>Satureia thymbra</italic>, 
 <italic>Salvia officinalis</italic>, 
 <italic>Laurus nobilis,</italic> and 
 <italic>Pistacia palestina</italic> were found to have selective inhibitory effects against, amelanotic melanoma (C32), renal celladenocarcinoma (ACHN), hormone-dependent prostatecarcinoma (LNCaP), and breast cancer (MCF-7) [

 <italic>Satureja montana</italic>, 
 <italic>Coriandrum sativum,</italic> and 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic>, were found to have selective cytotoxic activity against HeLa, MDA-MB-453, K562, and MRC-5 [
 <xref rid="B56-plants-10-00667" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The disappearance of the mixtures of the two EOs (1:1) might be ascribed to the negative synergetic effects of each EO upon the other and this phenomenon was reported in some reports. Haroun and Al-Kayali [
 <xref rid="B57-plants-10-00667" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] found that the different extracts of 
 <italic>Thymbra spicata</italic> showed positive synergetic effects via combination with some references antibiotics against some strains of bacteria and a while negative synergetic effects against other strains.
