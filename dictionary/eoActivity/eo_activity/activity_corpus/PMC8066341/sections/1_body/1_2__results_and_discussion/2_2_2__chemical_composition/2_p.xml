<p>In EO of 
 <italic>E. bonariensis,</italic> sesquiterpenes represented also the main constituents including several oxygenated and non-oxygenated metabolites. With a relative concentration of 81.06% of sesquiterpenes, our results are completely agreed with the previous data by Harraz, et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-plants-10-00667" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] that reported a relative concentration of 92.50%; trans-α-Farnesene (25.03%), isolongifolene-5-ol (5.53%), 
 <italic>α</italic>-maaliene (6.64%), berkheyaradulen (4.82%), and 
 <italic>α</italic>-muurolene (3.99%) were found the main sesquiterpenoid contents. The main sesquiterpene, trans-α-farnesene, was widely distributed in the EOs of 
 <italic>Conyza</italic> species such as 
 <italic>C. bonariensis</italic> (
 <italic>≈E. bonariensis</italic>) collected from Venezuela and Vietnam [
 <xref rid="B40-plants-10-00667" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], 
 <italic>C. canadensis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B39-plants-10-00667" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], and 
 <italic>C. sumatrensis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B41-plants-10-00667" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. However, in the only stated study of EO of 
 <italic>E. bonariensis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B34-plants-10-00667" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], α-bergamotene was described as the main compound in addition to some farnesene derivatives such as, 
 <italic>β</italic>-farnesene, and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-farnesene epoxide. The abundance of α-maaliene (6.64%), berkheyaradulen (4.82%), and α-muurolene (3.99%) were found in perfect harmony with our results of EO of 
 <italic>P. dioscoridis</italic>. The variations of secondary metabolites comprising EOs might be attributed to the plant age and development, plant organs, as well as the environmental factors including such as altitude, seasonality, atmospheric composition and temperature, and water availability [
