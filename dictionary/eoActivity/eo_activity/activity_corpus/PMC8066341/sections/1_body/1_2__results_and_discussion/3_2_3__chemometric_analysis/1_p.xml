<p>The EOs chemical compositions of the major compounds (&gt;3%), reported from different ecospecies of 
 <italic>P. dioscoridis</italic> and 
 <italic>E. bonariensis</italic> were constructed in a matrix. These collected data were subjected to agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) and principal component analysis (PCA). The cluster analysis of 
 <italic>P. dioscoridis</italic> EOs showed that the present studied sample of 
 <italic>P. dioscoridis</italic> is closely correlated to the Egyptian ecospecies collected from El-Sadat City, and little correlated to that collected from Cairoâ€“Suez desert road, Egypt (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00667-f003">Figure 3</xref>a). However, the present sample was different than those purchased from a commercial source in Cairo, Egypt. This means that the commercial samples are not in pure form or may be mixed with other plants.
