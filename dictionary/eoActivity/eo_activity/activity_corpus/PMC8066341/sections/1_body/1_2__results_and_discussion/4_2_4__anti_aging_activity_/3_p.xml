<p>In the present study, the anti-aging of the 1:1 mixture of the two EOs was evaluated to study the synergetic effects of the combination of the two EOs. Results revealed that the EO of 
 <italic>P. dioscoridis</italic>, 
 <italic>E. bonariensis,</italic> and the mixture of the two EOs (1:1) have strong anti-aging activity. These results might be attributed to the chemical components of these oils. The anti-aging activity was directly correlated with antioxidant potentiality [
 <xref rid="B45-plants-10-00667" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The main constituents in both EOs, sesquiterpenes, were described to play a significant role as antioxidants, anti-inflammatory agents, and thus anti-aging [
 <xref rid="B45-plants-10-00667" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Tu and Tawata [
 <xref rid="B45-plants-10-00667" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] reported that EO of the leaves of 
 <italic>Alpinia zerumbet</italic> exhibit antioxidant and anti-aging activities due to the high concentration of terpenoids, especially sesquiterpenes. Furthermore, the monoterpenes were documented as active anti-aging agents in EO of 
 <italic>Juniperus communis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B46-plants-10-00667" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> [
 <xref rid="B47-plants-10-00667" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. These reports concluded that the increase of free radical scavenging constituents in EOs lead to an increase in their anti-aging activity. Based upon this fact, the high concentrations of terpenes especially the oxygenated sesqui- and monoterpenes caused increasing in the anti-aging activity of EOs of these two plants. All these reported data deduced the role of synergetic effects between the components of the EOs. This fact of the role of synergetic effect was very clear in our results in which the mixture of the two EOs (1:1) exhibited better activity than the individual EO of each plant. In the mixture of the two EOs, the raising of concentration of oxygenated terpenes as well the synergetic effects between the components caused increasing of the inhibition potentiality.
