<p>Berkheyaradulen, muurolene, eudesmol, tau-muurolol, and caryophyllene, were found as marker compounds for this plant in the previous study [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-10-00667" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and this data is in the same line with our results. While the reported data of EO of the leaves of this plant [
 <xref rid="B38-plants-10-00667" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] exhibited variations in chemical constituents than those data described previously by our team [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-10-00667" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and also than our results herein. Elshamy, et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-10-00667" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] documented that 
 <italic>α</italic>-cadinol is the main sesquiterpene and this data is different than our results in which 
 <italic>γ</italic>-cadinol is present as a minor compound. Additionally, eudesmol and tau-muurolol were reported as major sesquiterpenes in EO of the leaves of this plant, and this data agreed with our results.
