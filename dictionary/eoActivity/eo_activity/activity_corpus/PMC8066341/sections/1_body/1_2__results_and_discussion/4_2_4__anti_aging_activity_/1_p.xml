<p>The EOs from 
 <italic>P. dioscoridis</italic>, 
 <italic>E. bonariensis</italic>, and the mixture of the two EOs (1:1) have a strong inhibitory activity of the collagenase, elastase, hyaluronidase, and tyrosinase (

 <sub>50</sub> of 1.85, 2.90, and 1.73 µg/mL for 
 <italic>P. dioscoridis</italic>, 
 <italic>E. bonariensis,</italic> and the mixture, respectively. Furthermore, the three EO treatments strongly inhibit the elastase enzyme with respective values of IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 14.63, 16.52, and 11.01 µg/mL. Furthermore, strong suppression of hyaluronidase was demonstrated via the three EO treatments based upon the respective observed values of IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 17.18, 15.16, and 13.54 µg/mL. By the same, the three tested displayed strong tyrosinase enzyme inhibition with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values at 19.52, 18.93, and 15.81 µg/mL, respectively. All the results were constructed based upon comparing with the polyphenolic compound, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), as a standard ant-aging reference [
