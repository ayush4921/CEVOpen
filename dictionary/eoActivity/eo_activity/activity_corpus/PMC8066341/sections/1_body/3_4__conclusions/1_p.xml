<p>Herein, the GC-MS analysis of EOs of the above-ground parts of 
 <italic>P. dioscoridis</italic> and 
 <italic>E. bonariensis</italic>, revealed the identification of 29 and 35 compounds, respectively. Sesquiterpenes were characterized as the main components of EOs derived from the two plants. The major components of EO of 
 <italic>P. dioscoridis</italic> were 
 <italic>α</italic>-maaliene, berkheyaradulen, dehydro-cyclolongifolene oxide, aromadendrene oxide-2, and 
 <italic>β</italic>-muurolene. While, 
 <italic>trans</italic>-α-farnesene, 
 <italic>O</italic>-ocimene, and α-maaliene represented the abundant constituents of 
 <italic>E. bonariensis</italic> EO. The observed variation in the EOs composition among the studied ecospecies and that reported support the changing of the taxa names. EO of 
 <italic>P. dioscoridis</italic> exhibited cytotoxicity against the two cancer cells, MCF-7 and A-549, while the EO of the 
 <italic>E. bonariensis</italic> showed activity only against HepG2. The EOs of 
 <italic>P. dioscoridis</italic> and 
 <italic>E. bonariensis</italic> as well as the mixture of them (1:1), exhibited significant anti-aging activity in which the mixture (1:1) &gt; 
 <italic>P. dioscoridis</italic> &gt; 
 <italic>E. bonariensis</italic>. All these data deduced the studied EOs of these two plants may be used as antiaging and anticancer leading agents.
