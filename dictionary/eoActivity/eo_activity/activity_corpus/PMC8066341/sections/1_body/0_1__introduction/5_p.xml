<p>We hypothesized that these two plant species were formerly named 
 <italic>Conyza</italic>, and their names were changed. Therefore, the chemical characterization of their EOs could be valuable in their chemotaxonomy. Herein, this work aimed to (i) identify the chemical profiles of EOs from 
 <italic>P. dioscoridis</italic> and 
 <italic>E. bonariensis</italic>, collected from Egypt, (ii) establish comparative profiles of the two plants based upon chemometric analysis with other reported ecospecies, (iii) study the cytotoxic activity of the EOs of the two plants against several human cancer cell lines, and (iv) assess in vitro anti-aging potentialities of the EOs of the two plants.
