 <caption>
  <p>Anti-aging activities of the EOs extracted from 
   <italic>Pluchea dioscoridis</italic> and 
   <italic>Erigeron bonariensis</italic> against the four enzymes: collagenase, elastase, hyaluronidase, and tyrosinase. Values are IC50 (µg/mL) as an average of three replicates and the bars representing the standard deviation. Different letters (A, B, and C) within each enzyme mean values significant at 0.05 probability level after Duncan’s test.
