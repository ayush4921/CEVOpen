<p>The DPPH scavenging assay was performed according to the method described by Liu [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], with some modifications. The reaction mixture consists of 1.5 mL of the ethanolic solution of ODSO in a concentration series (6, 4, 1, 0.40, and 0.10 mg/mL) and 1 mL of ethanolic solution of DPPH (0.001%). The mixture was shaken by vortex, and after 30 min of incubation, the absorbance was immediately determined by a spectrophotometer at 517 nm. Ascorbic acid, a standard antioxidant, was used as a reference. All assays were performed in triplicates. The scavenging activity of the samples was calculated according to the following formula:
