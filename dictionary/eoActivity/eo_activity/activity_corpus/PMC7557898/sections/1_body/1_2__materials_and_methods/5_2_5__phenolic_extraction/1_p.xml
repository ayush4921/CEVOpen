<p>The extraction of the total phenol compounds of ODSO was carried out by adding 1 mL of methanol 80% to 1 g of ODSO. Subsequently, the mixture was vortexed for 10 min; the whole is centrifuged for 15 min at 3800 rpm and room temperature. The hydroalcoholic extract of ODSO (supernatant) was recovered in a 5 mL volumetric flask, and the volume of the extract was adjusted to 5 mL with methanol 80%.</p>
