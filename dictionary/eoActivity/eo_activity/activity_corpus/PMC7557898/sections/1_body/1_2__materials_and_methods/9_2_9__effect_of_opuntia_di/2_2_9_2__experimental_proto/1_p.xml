<p>To evaluate the effect of ODSO treatment on the incidence of Allx-induced diabetes, the mice were randomly separated into five groups: control group, Allx group, Allx + ODSO (1 mL/kg), Allx + ODSO (2 mL/kg) treated groups, and Allx + Asco (2 mg/kg) group. During three days, treated animals received orally the ODSO (1 and 2 mL/kg) and ascorbic acid (2 mg/kg) to their respective groups, followed by a single dose injection of Allx at 1 h of the time interval. The treatment was sustained for a week after the Allx administration. Control and Allx groups received oral administration of distilled water (10 mL/kg) followed by an intraperitoneal injection of phosphate-citrate buffer and Allx, respectively. Blood was withdrawn from the mice tail vein, from overnight fasting mice, and glycemia was measured at the start and the end of the study, using a diagnostic kit. Bodyweight was determined before and after the treatment period [
