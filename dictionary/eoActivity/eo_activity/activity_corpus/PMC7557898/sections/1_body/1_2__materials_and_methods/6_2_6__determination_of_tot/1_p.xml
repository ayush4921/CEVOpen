<p>The determination of the total phenols of ODSO was carried out according to the Folin–Ciocalteu method [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Indeed, the reaction mixture contains 0.5 mL of the hydroalcoholic extract of ODSO, 0.5 mL of MethOH 80%, 5 mL of Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> 10%, and 1 mL of the Folin–Ciocalteu solution. The mixture was vortexed and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 60 minutes. Thereafter, the absorbance was measured at 750 nm by a spectrophotometer. The values are expressed in mg equivalent of caffeic acid.
