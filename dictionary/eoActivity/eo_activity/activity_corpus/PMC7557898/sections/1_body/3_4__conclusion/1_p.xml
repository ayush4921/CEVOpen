<p>In conclusion, the ODSO was effective in preventing diabetes in mice caused by the alloxan monohydrate. This effect could be due to their phenolic compounds, which could be reacted alone, or in synergy to scavenge the free radicals produced by the alloxan. Moreover, the capacity of their unsaturated fatty acids, sterols, and vitamin 
 <italic>E</italic> to improve antioxidant activity in pancreatic beta cells. Consequently, further studies need to be carried out to find out the mechanism of action of these bioactive compounds present in this oil to prevent the onset of diabetes. Moreover, ODSO has shown a significant antihyperlipidemic effect in mice. Hence, this effect could be linked to its richness in polyunsaturated fatty acids, phytosterols, vitamin 
 <italic>E</italic>, and phenolic compounds.
