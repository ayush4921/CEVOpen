<p>Bodyweight gain, relative kidney weight, and relative liver weight were not significantly different between all groups treated (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The high-fat-diet-fed mice produced did not cause significant increases in bodyweight gain, relative kidney weight, and relative liver weight compared with the standard diet-fed mice. The daily intake of ODSO of the high-fat diet-fed in mice attenuated the increased bodyweight, relative kidney weight, and relative liver weight of high-fat diet-fed mice and did not induce a significant difference compared to the high-fat diet-fed mice. These results are in good agreement with the results found by Kim et al. It was found that the perilla oil provoked an increase in the bodyweight gain in the high-fat-diet-fed mice, compared to the high-fat diet mice, but this increase was not significant [
