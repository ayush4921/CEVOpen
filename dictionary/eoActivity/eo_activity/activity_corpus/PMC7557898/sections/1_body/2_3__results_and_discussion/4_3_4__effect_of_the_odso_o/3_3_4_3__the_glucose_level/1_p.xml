<p>The result in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> shows the effect of ODSO daily intake on the glucose level in the high-fat diet-fed mice. The high-fat diet-fed mice have produced a significant increase in plasma glucose compared to the standard diet-fed mice. The abnormal lipid metabolism produced by the high-fat diet-fed mice is known to cause insulin resistance disease [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The daily intake of ODSO to the high-fat diet-fed mice has significantly attenuated the increase in the plasma glucose compared to the high-fat diet-fed mice. A study conducted by Bouhrim et al. proved that ODSO has a hypoglycemic effect in diabetic rats [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Ali et al. found similar results. It was found that cactus pier seeds oil, a natural product rich in unsaturated fatty acid [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], has antihyperglycemic property in diabetic rats [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Moreover, in the majority of studies on vegetable oils, it seems that they increase the tolerance to glucose in the different animal models following treatment in repeated doses, and this is by the regeneration of beta cells or the decrease of resistance to insulin [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Other studies have also shown an antihyperglycemic effect of different types of fixed oils (pomace olive oil) in the high-fat diet-fed mice [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. According to a research conducted on 
 <italic>O. ficus-indica</italic> grown in Tunisia, the addition of 
 <italic>O. ficus-indica</italic> seed oil in the diet of rats at a dose of 25â€‰g/kg has shown a significant hypoglycemic effect. Indeed, the enrichment of the diet with the oil induced a significant decrease in blood glucose (22%) and a significant increase of glycogen concentration in the liver and muscle [

Also Park et al. reported that essential fatty acids (linoleic and alpha-linolenic) improve glucose capture by muscle C2C12 cells-rendered insulin resistance by palmitic acid [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In a study, in which 3T3-L1 adipocyte lines were used, Prabhakar and Doble demonstrated that vanillic acid, one of the phenolic compounds of ODSO, increases glucose capture by treated adipocytes by approximately three times by inducing the PI3K pathway leading to increased translocation of GLUT4 to the cell surface [
