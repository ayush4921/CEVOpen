<p>The treatment of the mice with ODSO at doses of 1 and 2 mL/kg enhanced the survival rate 80% and 90%, respectively, after Allx injection (100 mg/kg), compared to the group treated only with Allx 60%. Several experimental studies have shown that Allx induces a sudden increase in insulin release immediately after injection [
