<p>The antioxidant effect of ODSO was evaluated over a range of concentrations, and the results of the DPPH scavenging effect are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. ODSO exhibited significant antioxidant activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.38 ± 0.08 mg/mL. Moreover, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> of ascorbic acid was 0.23 ± 0.01 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, and it is lower than that of ODSO. Additionally, the antioxidant ability of ODSO increased proportionally to its concentration in the mixture. Moreover, several studies evaluating this oil have shown that it has significant antioxidant activity [

 <italic>μ</italic>L/mL and is higher than that of ascorbic acid (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 16.56 ± 0.019 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL). Besides, antioxidant activity of this oil was proved to be concentration-dependent [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This essential antioxidant activity is an indicator of the presence of antioxidant molecules in this oil, such as phenolic compounds. Antioxidants are substances that protect our body from damage caused by free radicals by removing free radicals and preventing their oxidation [
