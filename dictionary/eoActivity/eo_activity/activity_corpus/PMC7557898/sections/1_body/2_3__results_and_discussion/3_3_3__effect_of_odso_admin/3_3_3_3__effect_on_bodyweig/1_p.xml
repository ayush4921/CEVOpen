<p>The bodyweight variation of mice is shown in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Allx caused a significant decrease in bodyweight in the Allx group (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) compared to the control group, which asserts the corruption of necessary proteins due to diabetes [

 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) the bodyweight loss in treated groups compared to the group treated only with Allx. These results suggest that the ODSO treatment significantly attenuated the development of the diabetes mellitus induced by Allx in Swiss albino mice. Moreover, these results are consistent with those found by Ali et al. [
