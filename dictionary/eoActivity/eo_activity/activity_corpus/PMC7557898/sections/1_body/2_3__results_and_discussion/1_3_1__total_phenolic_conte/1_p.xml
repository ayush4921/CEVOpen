<p>The determination of total phenols by the Folin–Ciocalteu method revealed that the average content of ODSO extracted by the ether petroleum in phenols equivalent milligrams of caffeic acid per 1000 g of oil is equal to 518.18 ± 14.36 mg/1000 g oil. In a study conducted by Koubaa et al., ODSO from the Sfax region (Tunisia) extracted using SC-CO2 was more enriched in polyphenols (172.2 ± 11.9 
 <italic>μ</italic>g GAE/g of oil) than that extracted with hexane (76.0 ± 6.9 
 <italic>μ</italic>g GAE/g of oil). Moreover, the polyphenol profiles showed that the SC-CO2 process gave a higher yield of compounds (45) compared with the extraction with hexane (11). In general, among the most abundant polyphenols in this oil, we find catechol, cinnamic acid, 3-phenylpropionic acid, psoralen, syringic acid, sinapaldehyde, 3′-O-methylcatechin, (+)-gallocatechin, bisdemethoxycurcumin, 4′-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin 3′-O-glucuronide, and viscutin 1 [
