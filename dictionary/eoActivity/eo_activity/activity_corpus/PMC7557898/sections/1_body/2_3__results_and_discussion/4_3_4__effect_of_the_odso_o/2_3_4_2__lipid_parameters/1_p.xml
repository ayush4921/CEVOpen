 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> presents the effect of the daily intake of the ODSO on lipid parameters on a high-fat diet-induced lipid metabolism disturbance in mice. The administration of the high-fat diet in mice has induced a significant increase in the cholesterol, HDL cholesterol/total cholesterol (%), triglycerides, and the atherogenic index levels, but it did not significantly decrease in serum levels of the HDL cholesterol (g/L) level compared to the normal control group. However, the daily intake of the ODSO has significantly attuned the increase in the cholesterol, HDL cholesterol/total cholesterol (%), triglycerides, and the atherogenic index levels and did not affect the HDL cholesterol (g/L) level compared to the high-fat-diet group. Until now, there are no data about the antihyperlipidemic effect of the ODSO in the high-fat-diet-fed animals. In other studies, the antihypercholesterolemic effect of other oils was evaluated. However, a study conducted by Kim et al. proved that the perilla oil or pomace olive oil intake significantly attenuated the increase in the plasma cholesterol in the high-fat diet-fed mice, and these results are in agreement with our findings [

 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Also, they showed that perilla oil treatment reduced the hepatic triglyceride levels compared with the high-fat diet-fed mice [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. According to the research carried out on the oil of another 
 <italic>Opuntia</italic> species from Tunisia, the supplementation of rat feed by 25 g/kg seed oil has induced a decrease of blood cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL); in contrast, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) remained almost unchanged during the treatment [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In another study conducted by Ennouri et al., it was shown that dietary supplementation of 
 <italic>O. ficus-indica</italic> seed oil at a dose of 25 g/kg could be useful in reducing the atherogenic risk factors in the rat. The enrichment of the diet by this oil has induced a very pronounced lipid-lowering effect in the treated rats compared to the rats receiving a control diet. Indeed, a significant reduction in total cholesterol and the ratio of HDL cholesterol to total cholesterol was significantly higher than that of the control group. Also, the atherogenic index was significantly lower in rats treated with an oil-rich diet than that in controls [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The chemical analysis of the ODSO was shown that this oil is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acid (linoleic acid) [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The most important function of polyunsaturated fatty acids is the provision of a unique class of precursors for conversion to metabolites, which regulate the lipid profile [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Moreover, mammals use linoleic acid as a precursor to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) that are important for lipid metabolic processes [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Therefore, Kim et al. suggest that perilla oil may affect the expression of lipid metabolic proteins and shows that perilla oil increased 
 <italic>p</italic>-AMPK, 
 <italic>p</italic>-ACC, and lipolytic proteins but decreased lipogenic proteins [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. It is universally accepted that the consumption of polyunsaturated vegetable oils will reduce plasma cholesterol levels. Also, the effect of polyunsaturated fatty acids on plasma triglyceride levels has been shown in several studies. And HDL cholesterol levels have been affected variable by linoleic acid-rich diets [
