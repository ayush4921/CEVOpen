<p>The effect of ODSO intake on the glycemic level of Allx-treated mice is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The injection of Allx induced a significant (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) increase in the fasting blood glucose of the diabetic control group mice compared to the normal control group mice. The administration of the ODSO at two doses 1 and 2 mL/kg with Allx in mice significantly (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) decreased the incidence of Allx-provoked hyperglycemia in the ODSO-treated group in comparison with the group treated only with Allx. The treatment with ascorbic acid at 2 mg/kg was attenuated significantly (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), and the alloxan provoked hyperglycemia compared to the group treated only by Allx. These results suggest that the ODSO treatment significantly attenuated the development of the diabetes mellitus induced by Allx in Swiss albino mice. Moreover, these results are consistent with those found by Ali et al. [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Indeed, Allx is known as a chemical molecule that is used in the laboratory to produce diabetic animal models [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. It is an unstable chemical compound that causes necrosis of pancreatic islet beta cells [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This effect is explained by the fact that the presence of Allx and its reducing products in the 
 <italic>ß</italic>-cells of the organism leading to the production of superoxide radicals (O2•) [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. These superoxide radicals undergoing dismutation eventually lead to the formation of hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) and react with ferrous (Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>) to produce hydroxyl radicals (OH•), a highly oxidizing agent [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This imbalance in the redox balance causes necrosis and death of pancreatic beta cells [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Therefore, permanent hyperglycemia, the diabetogenic effect of the chemical agent, which is Allx, passes through the oxidation process by the production of free radicals [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. High levels of free radicals are implicated in the development of many chronic diseases, according to scientific research [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In type 1 diabetes, free radicals also participate in the autoimmune reaction, leading to the destruction of pancreatic cells and the alteration of insulin synthesis and secretion [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Therefore, agents with antioxidant properties may have the potential for limiting diabetes progression [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This effect could be mainly due to the protection of Langerhans islets against the toxicity of free radicals produced by Allx. It is suggested that the ODSO contains components that have antioxidant properties and maintain the balance of the antioxidant/prooxidant balance of the 
 <italic>ß</italic>-pancreatic cells. In this study, the ODSO showed important antioxidant activity. It could be that this antidiabetogenic effect goes through its antioxidant effect. Indeed, the chemical analysis of this ODSO showed that it contains a huge quantity of unsaturated fatty acids, wherein linoleic acid is the majority of polyunsaturated fatty acids. It has been confirmed that oil rich in linoleic acid prevents Allx-provoked diabetes in rats by preserving redox homeostasis in 
 <italic>ß</italic>-cells and increasing the amount of cytoprotective antioxidant compounds such as glutathione reductase, superoxide dismutase, and vitamin E [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Moreover, the oil of 
 <italic>Opuntia ficus-indica</italic> was shown to have an antidiabetogenic effect [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and this oil was found rich in linoleic acid [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Moreover, the ODSO is rich in a metabolite of linoleic acid, 
 <italic>γ</italic>-linolenic, and pretreatment with 
 <italic>γ</italic>-linolenic acid was shown to prevent 100% of the incidence of Allx-induced diabetes in rats [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Besides, the ODSO was found in this study that is rich in 
 <italic>γ</italic>-tocopherol. 
 <italic>γ</italic>-Tocopherol has been reported to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Tomasch et al. who demonstrated that administration of the oil rich in 
 <italic>γ</italic>-tocopherol improves the antioxidant plasma capacity in healthy male volunteers have confirmed these results [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].
