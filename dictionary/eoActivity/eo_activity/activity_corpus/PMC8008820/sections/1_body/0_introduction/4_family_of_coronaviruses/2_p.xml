<p id="p0035">According to International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, coronaviruses come under subfamily of Coronavirinae from the family Coronaviridae and order Nidovirales (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> ) [
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The Coronavirinae subfamily is further divided into four genera, i.e., alpha-coronavirus, beta-coronavirus, gamma-coronavirus, and delta-coronavirus [
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. First two infect only mammals and rest infect birds and in some case mammals too. The alpha-coronaviruses include human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV), PEDV, and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), whereas the beta-coronaviruses include SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, bat coronavirus HKU4, mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), and human coronavirus OC43. The gamma-and delta-coronaviruses include avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV) and porcine delta-coronavirus (PdCV), respectively [
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The alpha-coronaviruses and beta-coronaviruses result into pulmonary illness in humans and cholera infantum in animals [
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. MERS-CoVs are deadly pathogenic viruses causing serious respiratory problem in humans, while other viruses like SARS-CoV and HCoV- NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43 and HKU1 do not result into critical conditions compared with the earlier. Domestic animals are the sources for transmission of these viruses from natural host to humans [
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Data collected from various databases show that all the human coronaviruses originated from animals such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E originated from bats [
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These studies concluded that bats are mainly responsible for transmission of these. SARS-CoV-2 also has been found to be originated from bats and further spread to human by zoonotic transmission according to reports published [
