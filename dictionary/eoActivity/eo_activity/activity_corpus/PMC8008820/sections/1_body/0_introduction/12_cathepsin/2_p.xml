<p id="p0100">Like viral protein processing, cellular machinery of virus is also very important and could be a potential therapeutic target [
 <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Keeping in view that SARS-CoV-2 shares similar viral entry mechanism with SARS-CoV, hence similarities in their cellular machinery such as endocytic mechanism for entering into cell could been visaged. Cathepsin is the lysosomal protease that has role in cellular protein turnover [
 <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. According to various studies, cathepsin B has important role in life cycles of coronavirus, Nipah virus, Ebola virus, influenza virus etc., and helps the virus to enter into cytoplasm through endosomes by fusing with viral envelope and endosomal membrane [
 <xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. The most common pathway of viral internalization is clathrin mediated endocytosis as seen in the life cycles of various viruses including coronavirus [

 <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Cathepsin L is also a promising target in coronavirus as proved by different studies, and therefore it could be a beneficial target for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2. Drug chlorpromazine is used to inhibit clathrin mediated endocytosis in Ebola virus and is being tested for SARS-CoV-2 too [
 <xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. There are several other drugs available to target cathepsin but so far, all are under clinical trials [
