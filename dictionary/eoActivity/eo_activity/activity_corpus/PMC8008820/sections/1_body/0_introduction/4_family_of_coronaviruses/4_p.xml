As it is clear from different reports that the sequence homology of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 is nearly similar but the transmission efficiencies are different which are probably due to changes in the nucleotide sequences in spike protein (S) and receptor binding domain [

Medical practitioners are using existing drugs for controlling the symptoms and a community of researchers globally are involved in developing new drug modalities and vaccines since past 8 months, however no success has been met so far and it may still take months to years in developing the same [
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Considering the high virulence of SARS-CoV-2, it is imperative to develop new preventive or therapeutic agents at the earliest to control the current pandemic situation. Bioactive molecules from plants have served as invaluable sources of different therapeutic drugs and are being used in the treatment of various diseases around the world. Medicinal plants are also being explored in management of COVID-19 pandemic in two ways, i.e., either as immunomodulators or viral target inhibitors based on their established roles in managing other viral diseases. The secondary metabolites and other chemical compounds from plants could prove as promising therapeutic agents as antiviral either by inhibiting the viral replication or viral cell entry and/or otherwise treating the underlying infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 and thus could prove a safer and innovative treatment for this viral infectious disease [
