<p id="p0080">Along with ACE-2, TMPRSS2 is also responsible for virus entry into the host cells by activating the viral S-proteins [
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. TMPRSS2 cuts the S-glycoprotein into two-part S1 and S2. Both subunits function differently; S1 binds with host cell surface receptor and S2 helps in fusion of host and viral cell. It is pertinent to note that spike protein activity is one of the main reasons for the viral pathogenicity and virulence [
 <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Various studies have shown that inactivating the TMPRSS2 could facilitate inhibition of the viral infection. Camostat mesylate is an example of FDA approved serine TMPRSS2 inhibitor used in other diseases, and is under clinical trials for COVID-19 and will take several months for clinical validation [
