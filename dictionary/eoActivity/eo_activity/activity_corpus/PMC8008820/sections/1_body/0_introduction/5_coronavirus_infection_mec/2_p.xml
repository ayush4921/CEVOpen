<p id="p0055">The SARS-CoV-2 share some sequence homology with SARS-CoV but show different transmission potential and infection range [
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The ongoing COVID-19 disease is seen as more treacherous with still no treatment and could be potentially due to certain functional mutations occurring in the SARS-CoV-2. The major differences observed in SARS-CoV-2 are absent 8a, longer 8b and shorter 3b segments and different Nsp-2 and -3 proteins. Along with these, the open reading frames are also different in some places like in orf8 and orf10 [
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The process of infection is totally dependent on the interaction between virus and the host cell and begins when the viral particles get attached to the cell surface receptor of the host cell and it delivers the nucleocapsid inside the target cell membrane. The main function is provided by S-protein in binding and fusion with the host cell membrane. SARS-CoV-2 binds with the same receptor ACE-2 present in respiratory epithelium and alveoli of lungs, as SARS-CoV. Fusion takes place because of gain of conformational changes by the spike protein and the process depends upon two factors i.e., pH acidification and proteolytic activation [

The S-protein is homotrimeric with each subunit having two domains S1; the receptor binding domain and S2; the membrane fusion domain enabling the virus to enter the host cell. After fusion, the cleavage of fusion protein is the prime event for further process of infection and it is the main characteristic of class I viral fusion proteins [
