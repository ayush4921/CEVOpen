<p id="p0095">PLpro is a 213Â kDa multidomain polypeptide which cleaves the 
 <italic>N</italic>-terminal region of polyprotein and releases nsp1, nsp2 and nsp3 required for correction of viral replication. Along with having role in viral replication, it has other important functions of stripping ubiquitin, deISGylation from proteins of host cell for viral immune evasion processes [
 <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. It is also considered as a promising therapeutic target that not only inhibits viral replication but also saves other cells from being infected by dysregulation of signalling cascades in the infected cells. There is a list of FDA approved drugs for various other diseases that specifically binds with viral PLpro effectively, as observed by virtual screening, however needs in vitro, 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and clinical validation to establish their effectiveness and clinical use [
