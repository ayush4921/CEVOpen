<p id="p0040">The SARS-CoV-2 is a single stranded, enveloped, large positive sense RNA virus with a size of nearly 125 nm and genome size of 27–32 kb [
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The virus contains four structural proteins i.e., envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M), spike protein (S) and nucleocapsid protein (N) (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> ). Viral genome is packed within nucleocapsid (N) with a shell of envelope outside [
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This envelope is associated with other three structural proteins (M, S, and E) having different functions; the membrane protein is a transmembrane glycoprotein which helps the virus in developing capsid and structure assembly whereas envelope protein is involved in virus packaging and spike protein helps entry into host cells [
