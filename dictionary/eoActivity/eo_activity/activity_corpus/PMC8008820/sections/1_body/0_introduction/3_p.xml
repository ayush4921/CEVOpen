<p id="p0030">Coronavirus was first discovered in animals and birds commonly in bats and cats in mid-1960s and found to spread to human by zoonotic transmission [

The coronaviruses went unrecognised globally until the SARS-CoV pandemic emerged in 2002–03 in Guangdong China, which caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infecting more than 8000 people with 800 deaths, followed by Middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) which emerged in 2012 in Saudi Arabia infecting nearly 2300 people with 850 deaths [

On January 2020, this novel virus was named as 2019‐nCoV officially by WHO and in the same month, several countries became the victim of this deadly infectious virus [
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Therefore, we can say that coronavirus mediated infections occur periodically in different areas of the world. The 2019 novel coronavirus shows 88% sequence similarity with bat derived SARS-CoV and 50% similarity with MERS-CoV [
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. WHO estimated the reproductive number (R
 <sub>0</sub>) for SARS-CoV-2 between 2 and 2.5 higher than the SARS-CoV which is 1.7–1.9 and MERS with &lt;1, thus a higher potential of spreading with mortality rate of COVID-19 is 2.3% which is less than that of SARS (~9.5%) and MERS (34.4%). According to various genomic and in vitro analyses, it is clear that SARS-CoV-2 shares same host cell entry receptor as SARS-CoV, i.e., angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) while MERS-CoV uses dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP4). Similar to earlier SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the novel SARS-CoV-2 infects part of lungs and thus causes bilateral peripheral pneumonia with multiple organ failures and thus has been declared more contagious than earlier SARS and alveolar MERS [
