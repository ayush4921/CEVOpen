<p id="p0090">Main protease Nsp5, is also known as 3C like protease which first auto cleaved from the poly proteins and then thereafter cleaves the nsps at 11 sites, i.e., nsp4-nsp16, an essential step in the mechanism of viral infection [
 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. This is the main protease hence sometimes called as Mpro and it shares almost 96% homology with SARS-CoV. Difference in structure arises in the dimer interface where polar amino group is replaced with nonpolar groups and hence catalytic activity of dimer increases [

A combination strategy using lopinavir-ritonavir; the protease inhibitors was tested against COVID-19, however no benefits was observed and it was observed to cause several side effects like diarrhoea, nausea, asthenia etc., but in some regions of South Korea, this combination was found to be effective, however the testing was done only in one patient [
 <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Thus, clinical study with large cohort of population is needed to establish the importance of this protease as drug target for COVID19.
