<p id="p0075">Choroquine (CQ), a well-known anti-malarial drug has been explored for prophylactic and therapeutic treatment in current pandemic due to multiple roles in inhibiting the viral life cycle [
 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. CQ inhibits the viral infection by increasing the endosomal pH value required for the fusion of virus and host cell. Treatment with CQ has shown improved pulmonary abrasion with healthy outcomes. It is also reported that high dose of CQ will cause cardiac risks and its safety and effectiveness is not investigated till now [

 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>]. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) shares the similar structure and antiviral activity with CQ and was looked upon as a better and safer treatment for COVID-19. Both are responsible for inhibiting the spike protein attachment with ACE-2 receptor in the host cell and also interfere with the glycosylation process of ACE-2 of host cell. CQ and HCQ decreased the cytokine storm, in COVID 19 patients. It disrupts the DNA/RNA interaction and reduces the expression of pro inflammatory genes [
