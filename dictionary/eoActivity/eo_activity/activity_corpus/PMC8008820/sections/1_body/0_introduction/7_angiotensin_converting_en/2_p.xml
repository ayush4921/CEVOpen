<p id="p0070">ACE-2 is the functional receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and is a negative regulator of renin angiotensin system (RAS) [
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The S-proteins of SARS-CoV-2 get attached with ACE-2 receptor of the host cell in a much stronger manner compared to the SARS-CoV thus producing higher pathogenicity [
 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Many reports have suggested that ACE-2 could be one of the possible COVID-19 targets as it can block the binding of the virus with the host cell and thus blocking the viral cell entry. Therapeutic options for blocking the viral entry utilizing neutralizing antibodies such as soluble receptor binding domain that could occupy ACE-2 and soluble ACE-2 are envisaged as possible viral trap and thus inactivators of SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Despite the initial controversy on use of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in hypertensive COVID-19 patients, several clinical findings have recommended their continued use during infection treatment as these drugs possess anti-inflammatory activities as well as inhibit platelets aggregation and thus preventing clot formation seen in COVID-19. Besides synthetic products, some natural products such as amentoflavone, chrysanthemin, and biovobin have shown good binding affinity towards ACE-2 [
