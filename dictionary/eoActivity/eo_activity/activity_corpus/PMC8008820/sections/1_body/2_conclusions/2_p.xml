<p id="p0170">In current adverse conditions of COVID-19 across the world, it is the urgent need of time to develop drugs or therapeutic options at the earliest. Developing new drugs and identifying novel drug targets are indeed time consuming and validation of such novel drugs/targets in clinical trials are mandatory to check their efficacy and effectiveness. Unavailability of the drugs and specific treatments for COVID-19 till date motivate the researchers to look for alternatives for successfully combating the current disease scenario. In this regard, medicinal plants containing specific phytomoieties could provide a wide scope as therapeutic drugs against COVID-19. Furthermore, the low toxicity of herbal medicines and an easy development process provide additional advantages in their fast and wide usage. This study has compiled a data of different types of phytoconstituents possessing antiviral activity against Coronaviruses as well as phytoconstituents showing affinities against therapeutic targets of SARS-CoV-2 like RdRP, 3CLpro, PLpro and the host cell targets like ACE-2 based on the computational screening methods. However, further
