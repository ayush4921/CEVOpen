Recently a team of scientists tested cannabis terpenes for antiviral activity against COVID-19 and the terpenes were found to reduce the severity of SARS virus by interruption with RNA replication proteins thus interfering with viral penetration in healthy cells [

Various essential oils have proved to be effective against various types of viruses which includes isoborneol, a monoterpenene, having antiviral effect against HSV1. Similarly, eugenol delayed the growth of Herpes virus and also interferes with HSV, while beta-caryophyllene was found to be effective against dengue virus [
