 <xref rid="bib121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. Alkaloids were found to have key roles in inhibition of viral replication as it blocks the function of viral DNA polymerase [
 <xref rid="bib122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. As these plant's secondary metabolites have DNA intercalating properties, they may be effective candidates against viral infection and could lead to development of drug molecules. Resoquine, synthetic derivative of quinine (alkaloid), an antimalarial drug has been found as an effective therapeutic agent against COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="bib123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. Isoquinoline was effective against spike protein and nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-OC43 in human lung cells suggesting that this could serve as a drug candidate against SARS-CoV-2. Some alkaloids which are having DNA intercalating activity are sanguinarine, quinine, cinchonine, hartmine, chelidonine, coptisine, berberine, palmatin, tetradine etc., and could be used for development of drug molecules [

 <xref rid="bib125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. Emetine isolated from ipecacuanha root for induction of vomiting in the poisoning management has been found as effective against COVID-19 [
