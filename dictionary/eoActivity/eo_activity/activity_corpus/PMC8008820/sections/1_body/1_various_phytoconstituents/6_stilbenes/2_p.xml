<p id="p0140">Stilbenes are naturally occurring defensive phenolic compounds found in grapes, berries, bark waste etc., also classified as phytoalexins as they are synthesized by plants in response to UV radiations. Stilbene have many biological functions like antioxidant, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antileukemia, anti-HIV, anti-Herpes simplex virus, etc. [

Different virtual screening studies suggested the use of stilbenes in COVID-19 as they inhibit the complex formed between spike protein and ACE-2 receptor by disrupting the interface of S-ACE-2 complex and thus blocking the entry to the host cell. Stilbenes having high binding affinity to this complex include resveratrol and piceatannol. Some other derivatives of stilbenes like

 <xref rid="bib145" ref-type="bibr">[145]</xref>]. Resveratrol has been already tested for MERS-CoV and was found effective as it decreases the cell death [
