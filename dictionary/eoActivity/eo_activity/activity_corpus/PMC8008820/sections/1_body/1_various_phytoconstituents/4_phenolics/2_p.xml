 <italic>Bombax malabaricium</italic> were tested for anti-HSV and anti-RSV respectively and were effective like ribavirin (antiviral) synthetic drugs [

Since most of the polyphenols are polar molecules and hence cannot be taken up by the host cells and thus may prove as good candidates against COVID-19 [
