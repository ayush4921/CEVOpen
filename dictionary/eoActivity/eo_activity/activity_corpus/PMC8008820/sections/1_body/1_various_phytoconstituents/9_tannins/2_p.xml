<p id="p0155">Tannins are naturally occurring compounds found in plants, seeds, bark, wood and fruits etc. and possess various biological properties and medical uses. The viral infections lead to the overproduction of free radicals and thus oxidative stress triggering the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen molecules and tannins extracted from plants are very much effective against oxidative stress [
