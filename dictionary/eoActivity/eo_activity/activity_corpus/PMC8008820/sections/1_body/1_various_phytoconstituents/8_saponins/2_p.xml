<p id="p0150">Saponins are non-ionic detergents which possess antifungal, cytotoxic, antibacterial and antiviral properties [

 <xref rid="bib155" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>]. Saponins carries antiviral activity as it can interact with viral envelope and capsid protein which results into disruption of viral particles, also it can interact with host cell membrane which inhibit the viral particle attachment to the host cells thus prevent fusion by coating the cell surface which minimizes the spreading of infections. Some study found that

Saikosaponins interfere with the early stage of viral replication including adsorption and penetration. Some studies demonstrated the antiviral activity of saikosaponins on other viruses like herpes simplex virus, hepatitis B virus and cytomegalovirus and HIV [
