<p id="p0145">Glycosides are simple sugar molecules having different functional groups. Different drugs and poisons extracted from plants are glycosides and thus useful in various treatments [
 <xref rid="bib147" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. Antiviral effects of glycosides have been observed in various studies like the cardiac glycosides were seen effective against both DNA and RNA viruses including cytomegalo virus, herpes simplex virus, influenza virus and coronavirus [

 <xref rid="bib149" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>]. It was already seen that glycosides are effective for influenza virus as it interferes with the virus attachment and disturbs the release of new viruses by inhibiting the hemagglutinin and sialidase enzymes [

 <italic>Fructus gardeniae</italic> are very much effective against influenza A as it reduced the cell death by suppressing influenza virus replication [
 <xref rid="bib152" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]. According to a recent report, antiviral activity of Ginsenoside Rb1 class of steroid glycosides was tested and found to be effective against SARS-CoV [
