 <xref rid="bib116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. Many flavonoids are seen having effective role against viral infections especially at the molecular level for inhibiting the growth of virus [
 <xref rid="bib117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. Flavonoids block the entry of virus into the cell by blocking the cellular receptors and also interfere with viral replication and translation [
 <xref rid="bib118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. Considering the important role played by Mpro enzyme in viral replication and translation, it can be used as one of the potential targets for COVID-19. Different virtual screening studies carried against Mpro enzyme have proposed several flavonoids like azithromycin, mangiferin, procyanidin-β-2,7-dimethoxyflavaN-4′-O-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside, amentoflavone, hidrosmin, diosmin, gallocathechin gallate, elsamitrucin, pectolinaren, quercetin and isoquercetin having high binding affinities and thus could be used to combat the current situation. Along with the Mpro, ACE-2 is also a potential therapeutic target and flavonoids including hesperetin, myricetin, linebacker and caflanone have shown high binding affinity against ACE-2 making them important points of study against SARS-CoV-2 [
