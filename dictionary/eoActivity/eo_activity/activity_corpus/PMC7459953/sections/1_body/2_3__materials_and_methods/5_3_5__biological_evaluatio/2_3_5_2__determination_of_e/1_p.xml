<p>The possible inhibitory potential of the essential oil samples was investigated against tyrosinase and α-amylase enzymes using standard in vitro bioassays as previously reported by Mamadalieva et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-antibiotics-09-00518" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] in which all the samples were analyzed in triplicate. Results are expressed in mgKAE/g oil for tyrosinase inhibitory activity and in mmol ACAE/g oil for α-amylase inhibition.
