<p>A Shimadzu GC-17A gas chromatograph (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) with an FID detector and DB-5 fused-bonded cap column (Phenomenex; 29 m × 0.25 mm i.d., film thickness 0.25 µm; Torrance, California, USA) was utilized for the semi-quantitative determination of the different components of the essential oils using the normalization method to get the relative percentage of each component and applying GC-FID data that is highly sensitive using GC solution
 <sup>®</sup> software ver. 2.4 (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). The areas under the peaks (AUP) were determined using three independent runs where the total area is considered as 100%. Meanwhile, the Shimadzu GC-2010 plus gas chromatograph (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) supplied with Rtx-5MS (Restek, Bellefonte, PA, USA) in addition to a quadrupole mass spectrometer was used for the identification of the essential oil different metabolites. Instrument settings were adjusted according to what was previously reported [

The Wiley Registry of Mass Spectral Data 8th edition, NIST MassSpectral Library (December 2011), and previously reported data were employed to confirm the identity of the compounds and the retention indexes were calculated to corroborate the identification of the volatile compounds [
