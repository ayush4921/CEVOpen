<p>The α-amylase enzyme is critical in assisting in the catalysis of the first steps in the conversion of starch into maltose, and subsequently to glucose [

Similarly, the potent α-amylase inhibitory potential is mainly due to the synergistic action between the different components, which is in accordance to different previously reported studies that confirmed the α-amylase inhibitory effect of different terpenes and different

 <italic>F. gummosa</italic> essential oil [
