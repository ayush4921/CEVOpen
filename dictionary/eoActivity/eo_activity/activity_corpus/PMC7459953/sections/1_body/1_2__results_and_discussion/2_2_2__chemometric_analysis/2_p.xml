<p>The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) between the essential oil contents of different studied samples indicated that 
 <italic>Fc</italic> had a highly significant positive correlation with 
 <italic>Ft</italic> (r = 0.71), 
 <italic>Fk</italic> (r = 0.58), 
 <italic>Fv</italic> (r = 0.47) and 
 <italic>Fp</italic> (r = 0.35), while a non-significant negative correlation was observed between 
 <italic>Fc</italic> and 
 <italic>Fs</italic> (the highest correlations were observed between 
 <italic>Ft</italic> and 
 <italic>Fk</italic> (r = 0.89, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), between 
 <italic>Fc</italic> and 
 <italic>Ft</italic> (r = 0.71, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and between 
 <italic>Fc</italic> and 
 <italic>Fk</italic> (r = 0.58, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) as seen in 
 <xref rid="antibiotics-09-00518-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. These data indicate that three samples, 
 <italic>Ft</italic>, 
 <italic>Fk</italic>, and Fc have highly similar essential oil content.
