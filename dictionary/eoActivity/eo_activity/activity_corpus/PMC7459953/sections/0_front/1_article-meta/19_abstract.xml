 <p>The differences in the composition of essential oils obtained from the aerial parts of six 
  <italic>Ferula</italic> species viz., 
  <italic>F. caratavica</italic> (
  <italic>Fc</italic>), 
  <italic>F. kuchistanica</italic> (
  <italic>Fk</italic>), 
  <italic>F. pseudoreoselinum</italic> (
  <italic>Fp</italic>), 
  <italic>F. samarcandica</italic> (
  <italic>Fs</italic>), 
  <italic>F. tenuisecta</italic> (
  <italic>Ft</italic>) and 
  <italic>F. varia</italic> (
  <italic>Fv</italic>) were detected both qualitatively and semi-quantitatively using GC-MS and GC-FID analyses. One hundred and six metabolites were identified that account for 92.1, 96.43, 87.43, 95.95, 92.90 and 89.48% of 
  <italic>Fc</italic>, 
  <italic>Fk</italic>, 
  <italic>Fp</italic>, 
  <italic>Fs</italic>, 
  <italic>Ft</italic> and 
  <italic>Fv</italic> whole essential oils, respectively. The data from the GC-MS analyses were subjected to unsupervised pattern recognition chemometric analysis utilizing principal component analysis (PCA) to improve the visualization of such differences among the six species. 
  <italic>Fk</italic> and 
  <italic>Ft</italic> are very closely related to each other and were gathered together in one cluster. The antioxidant potential was assessed in vitro using different assays including 2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS), cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC), ferric reducing power (FRAP) and phosphomolybdenum (PM) assays. 
  <italic>Ft</italic> and 
  <italic>Fp</italic> exhibited the most notable antioxidant properties as evidenced by their pronounced activities in most of the antioxidant assays performed, followed by 
  <italic>Fc</italic>. 
  <italic>Fk</italic> showed the most effective tyrosinase inhibitory potential, which was estimated as 119.67 mgKAE/g oil, while 
  <italic>Fp</italic> exhibited the most potent α-amylase inhibitory potential, which was equivalent to 2.61 mmol ACAE/g oil. Thus, it was concluded that 
  <italic>Ferula</italic> species could serve as a promising natural antioxidant drug that could be included in different products and spices to alleviate hyperglycemia and used as a natural ingredient in pharmaceutical cosmetics to counteract hyperpigmentation.
