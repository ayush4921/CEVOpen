 <italic>Eriosema</italic> (Fabaceae), with approximately 150 species of shrubs, shrublets and herbs, is the second-largest genus of the Cajaninae subtribe (
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 1995</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">LPWG, 2017</xref>). This monophyletic clade originated in the late Miocene and its diversification occurred in parallel with the savanna biome expansion around the world (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">C창ndido et al., 2020</xref>). The current centers of diversity and endemism of 
 <italic>Eriosema</italic> species include the grasslands, wooded savanna and waste places of Africa (West, Central, East and South Africa), Central America (from Mexico to northern Argentina, except for Chile), Southeast Asia and Northern Australia (

 <xref rid="B161" ref-type="bibr">Schrire et al., 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">C창ndido et al., 2019</xref>). The African species are most abundant (nearly 110 species) and the first diverging evolution suggests an African origin of the genus (

 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">C창ndido et al. (2019)</xref> recorded 35 
 <italic>Eriosema</italic> species in Brazil, which encompasses 85% of the diversity of the genus in the Americas (35 out of 41 species).
