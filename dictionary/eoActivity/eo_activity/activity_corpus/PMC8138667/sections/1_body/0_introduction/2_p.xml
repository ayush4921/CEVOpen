<p>Throughout this pantropical region, several 
 <italic>Eriosema</italic> species are intensively used in traditional medicine and for non-medicinal purposes (e.g. food/vegetables, tooth brush). Based on the traditional uses, phytochemical, pharmacological and toxicological investigations of different 
 <italic>Eriosema</italic> species have been performed. Nevertheless, till now only few reviews dealing with 
 <italic>Eriosema</italic> species have been published. The studies by 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">CÃ¢ndido et al. (2019</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2020)</xref>, respectively, focused on the taxonomic synopsis of 
 <italic>Eriosema</italic> in Brazil and molecular phylogenetic insights into the evolution of 
 <italic>Eriosema</italic>. In 2015, Awouafack et al. demonstrated that 
 <italic>Eriosema</italic> species represent a rich source of flavonoids with interesting pharmacological activities. In this review, authors compiled a total of 52 flavonoids (isoflavones, dihydroflavanols, isoflavanones, flavanols, flavanones, and dihydrochalcones) isolated from 
 <italic>Eriosema</italic> species. However, the pharmacological properties are not limited to the flavonoids. In the literature, compounds from other chemical classes as well as plant extracts (more easily available and affordable than isolated compounds) demonstrated pharmacological properties. More recently, the review of 
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">Kleynhans et al. (2020)</xref> focused on 
 <italic>Eriosema kraussianum</italic> Meisn. None of these reviews presented the global overview on the traditional uses, phytochemistry, pharmacological properties and toxicological evaluation of this genus. Accordingly, the present review attempts to critically summarize the available information on the traditional uses, phytochemistry, and pharmacological activities as well as safety evaluation of the genus 
 <italic>Eriosema</italic> and, therefore to evaluate the data for potential phytotherapeutic approaches.
