 <xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr">Ojewole et al. (2006)</xref> investigated the vasodilatory effects of 
 <bold>64</bold> and 
 <bold>65</bold> (100–2,000 μg/ml) from the rootstock of 
 <italic>E. kraussianum</italic> in isolated portal veins. Both constituents, after provoked initial slight contraction, induced a dose-dependent secondary and pronounced vasorelaxant effect, probably by affecting calcium mobilization and/or sequestration, and possibly also, calcium release from its various tissue stores.
