<p>There is growing interest in 17
 <italic>β</italic>-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (17
 <italic>β</italic>-HSD2), an enzyme able to regulate the intracellular concentration of estradiol and testosterone by transforming them into the less potent forms estrone and androstenedione (
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">Marchais-Oberwinkler et al., 2011</xref>) in tissues where it is expressed, such as bone (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Dong et al., 1998</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Eyre et al., 1998</xref>). Blockade of this enzyme is thought to increase intracellular estradiol and testosterone, which thereby inhibits bone resorption by osteoclasts and stimulates bone formation by osteoblasts (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Abdelsamie et al., 2019</xref>). In line with this 17
 <italic>β</italic>-HSD2 is more and more considered as target for antiosteoporosis treatment. In an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assay using lysates of cells expressing the recombinant human enzyme 17
 <italic>β</italic>-HSD2, 
 <xref rid="B177" ref-type="bibr">Vuorinen et al. (2017)</xref> tested 36 hit molecules, including 
 <bold>44</bold> and 
 <bold>73</bold> from 
 <italic>E. laurentii</italic>. These compounds with respective IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 1.52 and 2.03 µM were among the most active 17
 <italic>β</italic>-HSD2 inhibitors tested. However, they selectively inhibited 17
 <italic>β</italic>-HSD1 (that catalyzes the reverse reaction) over 17
 <italic>β</italic>-HSD2 and therefore cannot be suitable lead structures for a possible therapeutic use (
