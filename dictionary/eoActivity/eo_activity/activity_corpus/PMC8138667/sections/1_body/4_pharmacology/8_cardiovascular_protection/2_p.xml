<p>Increased risk of cardiovascular diseases such dyslipidemia is well known to be associated with menopause. Using a postmenopause-like model (ovariectomized Wistar rats), a 9-weeks oral treatment with a methanol extract of the aerial parts of 
 <italic>E. laurentii</italic> significantly decreased the total cholesterol (TC) and LDL levels at 200 mg/kg. Increased HDL as well as a non-significant decrease of triglycerides (TG) levels were also observed at all tested doses (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg). The extract decreased the ovariectomy-increased TC/HDL and LDL/HDL ratios. A significant decrease of the atherogenic plasma index [AIP: log
 <sub>10</sub> (TG/HDL)] was determined at all tested doses (
