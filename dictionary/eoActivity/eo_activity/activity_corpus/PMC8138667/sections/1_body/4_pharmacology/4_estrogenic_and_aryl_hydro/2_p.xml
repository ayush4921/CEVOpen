<p>The estrogenic properties of 
 <italic>E. laurentii</italic>, traditionally used against female infertility, gynecological and menopausal complaints have been evaluated 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. 
 <italic>In vitro,</italic> a methanol extract of the aerial parts (AEL), its fractions and the predominant secondary metabolites 
 <bold>43</bold>, 
 <bold>44</bold> and 
 <bold>73</bold> induced a significant and concentration-dependent β-galactosidase activity in the ERα yeast two-hybrid assay (yERα) (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Ateba et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Ateba et al., 2014b</xref>). At 25 μg/ml, AEL was as potent as 10 nM estradiol (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Ateba et al., 2013</xref>). Compounds 
 <bold>43</bold>, 
 <bold>44</bold> and 
 <bold>73</bold> displayed EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.32 µM, 6.1 µM and 21.4 nM, respectively, while that of 17β-estradiol (E
 <sub>2</sub>) was 0.27 nM. All the three compounds were full ERα agonists as they displayed the maximal efficacy of E
 <sub>2</sub> although at much higher concentrations (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Ateba et al., 2014b</xref>). A methanolic extract of the underground parts of 
 <italic>E. laurentii</italic> (UEL) was also highly active in yERα (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Ateba et al., 2016b</xref>). The concentration of 10 μg/ml was as potent as 0.5 nM E
 <sub>2</sub>. However, compounds 
 <bold>22</bold>, 
 <bold>62</bold> and 
 <bold>63</bold> from this extract did not show any yERα activity (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Ateba et al., 2016b</xref>).
