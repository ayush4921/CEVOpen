<p>Using a well-known postmenopausal-like model of osteoporosis (ovariectomy) in rats, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Ateba et al. (2013)</xref> evaluated the effects of a 9-weeks oral treatment with a methanolic extract of the aerial parts of 
 <italic>E. laurentii</italic>. The extract significantly increased the dry femur weight (at 50 and 200 mg/kg), and calcium levels in serum (at 50 and 200 mg/kg) and femur (at all tested doses) compared with ovariectomized animals. The serum levels of inorganic phosphorus decreased, while the femur levels increased in a dose-dependent manner. Although the dose of 200 mg/kg was not able to completely reverse the ovariectomy-increased alkaline phosphatase (a biomarker for osteoblastic activity and bone remodeling), it decreased it by ∼15%. Based on the increased in femur mass, and femur calcium and inorganic phosphorus contents, the authors concluded that bone formation exceeded resorption suggesting the inhibition of bone resorption and activation of bone formation.
