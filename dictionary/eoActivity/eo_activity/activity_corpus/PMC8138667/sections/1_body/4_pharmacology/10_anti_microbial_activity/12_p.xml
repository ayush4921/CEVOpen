<p>In a study by 
 <xref rid="B162" ref-type="bibr">Sianglum et al. (2019)</xref>, lupinifolin (
 <bold>39</bold>) demonstrated an antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic> ATCC29212, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC25923 as well as susceptible and multidrug-resistant enterococcal clinical isolates (
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic> and 
 <italic>E. faecium</italic>) in the standard broth microdilution method. Although the tested compound was not extracted from an 
 <italic>Eriosema</italic> species, it has been reported in roots of 
 <italic>E. chinense</italic> and 
 <italic>E. robustum.</italic> In that study, 
 <bold>39</bold> displayed activity against all susceptible and resistant strains with MICs and MBCs (minimum bactericidal concentration) ranging between 0.5 and 2 μg/ml and between 2 and 16 μg/ml, respectively. Toward all the strains, compound 
 <bold>39</bold> with MIC values of 0.5–2 μg/ml was more active than vancomycin (MIC of 1–256 μg/ml). It increased membrane permeability and caused loss of salt tolerance. On 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic> ATCC29212, 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic> HTY0037 (a multidrug resistance isolate) and 
 <italic>E. faecium</italic> HTY0256 (a strong biofilm-producing vancomycin-resistant enterococci isolate), after 2 h incubation it displayed significant rapid antibacterial activity. Moreover, an antibiofilm-producing activity of 
 <bold>39</bold> against four MDR enterococci was shown.
