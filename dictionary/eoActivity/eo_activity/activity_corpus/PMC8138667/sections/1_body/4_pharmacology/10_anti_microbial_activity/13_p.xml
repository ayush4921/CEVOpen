<p>Eighteen articles dealing with the antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>Eriosema</italic> species have been published using disk diffusion, broth dilution and thin layer chromatography (TLC) bioautography methods. The “traditional” inhibitory zone (IZ) determined by the disc diffusion method depends on the coefficient of diffusion of compounds, highly polar substances diffusing more easily in agar and displaying a high IZ and 
 <italic>vice versa</italic> (
 <xref rid="B168" ref-type="bibr">Tan and Lim, 2015</xref>). Therefore, this assay is only useful for a simple qualitative screening as it does not allow the determination of the real amount of the antimicrobial agent that diffuses into the agar, impeding the determination of MICs and MBCs (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Balouiri et al., 2016</xref>). Based on the MIC values, extracts (or compounds) display: 
 <italic>i</italic>) a strong antimicrobial activity 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> if the MIC ≤100 μg/ml (or 10 μg/ml), 
 <italic>ii</italic>) moderate if 100 &lt; MIC ≤625 μg/ml (or 10 &lt; MIC ≤100 μg/ml), 
 <italic>iii</italic>) and low if MIC &gt; 625 μg/ml (or &gt;100 μg/ml) (

 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">Kuete, 2010</xref>). Based on this classification, several extracts and compounds from 
 <italic>Eriosema</italic> species displayed promising antimicrobial activity. Unfortunately, in several studies positive controls were not included or their concentration was not stated. Although some studies are suggesting the potential of few compounds to act as an antimicrobial drug against several microorganisms, these deficiencies weaken the evidence.
