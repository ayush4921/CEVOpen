<p>Using the disk diffusion method, the essential oil from the fresh leaves of 
 <italic>E. englerianum</italic> (1, 2, 5 and 10 μL/ml) was tested against eight different bacteria (
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>P. vulgaris</italic>, 
 <italic>Clostridium sporogenes</italic> and 
 <italic>Acinetobacter calcoaceticus</italic>). Considered as positive result by authors, a diameter of inhibition zone (IZ) ≥ 7 mm was observed at 5 μL/ml against 
 <italic>A. calcoaceticus</italic>, and at 10 μL/ml against 
 <italic>C. sporogenes</italic> and 
 <italic>A. calcoaceticus</italic> (

 <italic>C. albicans</italic> (24.2–42.6%), 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> (34.7–49.7%) and 
 <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic> (27.5–39.3%) at concentrations of 1–10 μL/ml was seen, while nystatin inhibited them by 84.3, 76.3 and 76.3%, respectively. However, the concentration of nystatin displaying this activity was not indicated (
