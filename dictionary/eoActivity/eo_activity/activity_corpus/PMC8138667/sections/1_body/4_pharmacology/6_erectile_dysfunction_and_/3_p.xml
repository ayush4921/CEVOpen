 <italic>Eriosema cordatum, E. kraussianum</italic> and 
 <italic>E. salignum</italic> and the other 
 <italic>Eriosema</italic> species that come under the 
 <italic>isiZulu</italic> indigenous umbrella name of “uBangalala” are widely traditionally used mainly in South Africa for curing or alleviating ED and/or impotence (

 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">Hutchings et al., 1996</xref>). However, despite their high reputation in that domain, the investigation only focused on 
 <italic>E. kraussianum</italic> with two papers published more than 15 years ago. In line with this, these 
 <italic>Eriosema</italic> species traditionally used against ED remain underexplored and even seem to be abandoned. Given the burden of this sensitive topic, they require more research attention.
