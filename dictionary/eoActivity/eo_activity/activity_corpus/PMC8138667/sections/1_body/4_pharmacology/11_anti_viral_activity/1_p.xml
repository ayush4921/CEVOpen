 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Cos et al. (2002a)</xref> assessed the anti-human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) effects of a polar fraction of an ethanolic leaf extract of 
 <italic>Eriosema montanum</italic> Baker f. using a tetrazolium-based colorimetric assay in infected MT-4 cells. The polar fraction was obtained suspending the extract in 60% methanol and defatting with petroleum ether. The polar fraction with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> value &gt;166 μg/ml did not protect the HIV-infected cells.
