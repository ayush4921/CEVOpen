<p>By controlling the formation and scavenging of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) as well as interrupting the related chain reactions and lipid peroxidation, antioxidants constitute the first line of defense against the genesis of various chronic and degenerative diseases. Different 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> methodologies, including the DPPH (1,1-di-phenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl), nitric oxide radical and H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> scavenging assays, potassium ferricyanide antioxidant power (PFRAP), hydroxyl radical antioxidant capacity (HORAC), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and the Î²-carotene bleaching test were used to evaluate the radical scavenging and antioxidant potential of members of the 
 <italic>Eriosema</italic> genus.
