<p>Using peripheral blood mononuclear cells, 
 <xref rid="B160" ref-type="bibr">Santos et al. (2016)</xref> investigated the impact of a dichloromethane-ethanol extract of 
 <italic>E. campestre</italic> (6.25, 12.5 and 25 μg/ml) on pathological processes of chronic inflammatory diseases. In a concentration-dependent manner, the extract inhibited the proliferation of T lymphocytes, including CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> cells, and decreased IL-2 levels in the supernatant of the cell cultures, a cytokine essential for the expansion of T lymphocytes.
