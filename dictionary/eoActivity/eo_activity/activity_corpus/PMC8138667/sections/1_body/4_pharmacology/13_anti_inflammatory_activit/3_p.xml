<p>Cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors are known to be a therapeutic target in inflammatory and neuroinflammatory diseases (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Grosser et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Dhir, 2019</xref>). The COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitory activities of extracts of the roots of 
 <italic>E. cordatum</italic> were investigated by 
 <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">Ndhlala et al. (2011)</xref>. At 250 μg/ml, petroleum ether, dichloromethane and ethanolic extracts weakly inhibited COX-1 activity by 13, 25 and 34%, respectively. A weak inhibition of COX-2 by 6, 35 and 10%, respectively, with 250 μg/ml of the petroleum ether, dichloromethane and ethanolic extracts was observed. The aqueous extract remained almost without effects on both enzymes at 2 mg/ml.
