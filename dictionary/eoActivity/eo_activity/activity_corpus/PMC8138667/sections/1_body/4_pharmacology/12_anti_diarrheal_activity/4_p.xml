<p>Both infectious and non-infectious (chemically induced) reliable models were used to evaluate the anti-diarrheal potential of 
 <italic>Eriosema</italic> species 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, from five species traditionally claimed to be anti-diarrheal (
 <italic>E. affine</italic>, 
 <italic>E. chinense</italic>, 
 <italic>E. griseum</italic>, 
 <italic>E. psoraleoides</italic> and 
 <italic>E. tuberosum</italic>), only the ethanolic root extract of 
 <italic>E. chinense</italic> and compounds 
 <bold>39</bold> and 
 <bold>81</bold> were investigated, indicating that in the 
 <italic>Eriosema</italic> genus this domain is underexplored. Given the promising results obtained with one extract, it would be interesting to extend the exploration to the other 
 <italic>Eriosema</italic> species traditionally used against diarrhea.
