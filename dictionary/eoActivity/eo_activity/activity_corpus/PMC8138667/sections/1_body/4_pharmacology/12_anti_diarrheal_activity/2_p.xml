<p>Castor oil-induced diarrhea is known as an efficient model for the initial screening for antimotility, antisecretory and anti-inflammatory compounds. In the gut, ricinoleic acid (castor oil metabolite) causes irritation and inflammation in bowels leading to diarrhea (stomach cramp, increased peristaltic activity and intestinal fluid volume) (
