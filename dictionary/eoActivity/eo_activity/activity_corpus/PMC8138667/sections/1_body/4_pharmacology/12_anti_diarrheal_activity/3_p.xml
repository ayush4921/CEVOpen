<p>Enteropathogenic 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (EPEC) is a common cause of moderate to severe water diarrhea in children, accompanied with fever, vomiting and a high hazard of death. In an enteropathogenic 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>-induced diarrhea rat model, EEC (100 and 200 mg/kg), CEC (50 and 100 mg/kg) and 
 <bold>81</bold> (5 and 10 mg/kg) induced a significant recovery from diarrhea characterized by the reduction in total number of stools, total number of diarrheal stools, weight of stools, mean defecation rate and water content of stools 6 h after induction of diarrhea (
