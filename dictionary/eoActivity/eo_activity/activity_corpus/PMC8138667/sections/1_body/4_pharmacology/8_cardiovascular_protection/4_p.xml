<p>Preeclampsia is the most common pregnancy-related complication worldwide, affecting 5–7% of all pregnancies with estimated 70,000 maternal deaths and 500,000 fetal and neonatal deaths each year (
 <xref rid="B152" ref-type="bibr">Rana et al., 2019</xref>). This incidence probably remains underestimated due to underreporting (
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">Mayrink et al., 2018</xref>). The options for prevention and treatment of this hypertensive disorder are extremely limited, especially in resource-limited settings (
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">Lemoine and Thadhani, 2019</xref>) where almost all of the deaths occur (
 <xref rid="B140" ref-type="bibr">Oyston and Baker, 2020</xref>). In this context, medicinal plants and herbs are an opportunity. In preeclampsia, the abnormal placentation characterized by impaired spiral artery remodeling lead to an ischemic placenta, which releases factors such as anti-angiogenic factors sFlt-1 (soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1) and sEng (soluble Endoglin), responsible for vascular dysfunction, into the maternal circulation (

 <sc>l</sc>-NAME-induced preeclamptic Sprague-Dawley rat model. Subcutaneously administered at 10 mg/kg for 12 consecutive days, the compound decreased fetal mortality, demonstrated a trend toward increasing birth and placental weights by improving placental perfusion, reducing blood pressure amplification through a NO-independent mechanism, and decreasing the plasma levels of sFlt-1and sEng.
