<p>At the maximal non-toxic concentrations of 375 μg/ml, this polar fraction exhibited a pronounced antiviral activity (reduction factor of the viral titer (RF) of 10
 <sup>3</sup> – 10
 <sup>4</sup>) against Herpes simplex virus type 1, Poliomyelitis virus type 1 strain 1A/S3 and Semliki forest virus A7, while at 187.5 μg/ml it displayed a RF of 10
 <sup>3</sup> against Coxsackie B2 virus. RF values of 10
