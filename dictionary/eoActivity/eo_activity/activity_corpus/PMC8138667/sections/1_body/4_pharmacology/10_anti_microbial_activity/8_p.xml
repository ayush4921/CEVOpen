<p>Methanolic extracts of the bark and wood of twigs of 
 <italic>E. psoraleoides</italic> displayed very high MIC values (≥1.25 mg/ml) against 
 <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> HG 982, 
 <italic>Actinomyces viscosus</italic> HG485 and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> HG392 in the agar dilution method (
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">Khan et al., 2000</xref>). MIC values of 8, 32 and 128 μg/ml against these microorganisms were observed with the standard chlorhexidine, respectively. Using a bioautography agar overlay method,

 <italic>E. psoraleoides</italic> was not active against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>. A methanolic leaf extract as well as its 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane and ethyl acetate fractions were tested against

 <italic>P. vulgaris</italic>,

 <italic>n</italic>-hexane fraction with a MIC value of 150 μg/ml toward 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC. The MIC value of the standard gentamicin was not reported (
