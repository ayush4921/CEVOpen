<p>Classical, suitable and reproducible systems/models have been used to evaluate estrogenic and aryl hydrocarbon agonistic properties of 
 <italic>E. laurentii in vitro</italic> (
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">Jungbauer and Beck, 2002</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B153" ref-type="bibr">Reiter et al., 2009</xref>) and

 <xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr">OECD, 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">Mvondo et al., 2011</xref>). Accordingly, all data reported in this section demonstrated the potential of 
 <italic>E. laurentii</italic> for managing various gynecological and menopausal complaints. However, this species is also traditionally used for treating female infertility. Studies in that domain are needed. Similarly, a wide traditional use of 
 <italic>E. cordatum</italic> in South Africa against female infertility has been recorded. Nevertheless, no published study demonstrates this potential till now.
