<p>From ancient times, plants have served as a dependable source of medicines for treating ED. In the 
 <italic>Eriosema</italic> genus, 
 <italic>E. cordatum, E. kraussianum</italic> and 
 <italic>E. salignum</italic> are traditionally or locally used as aphrodisiac or against male sexual disorders (ED, impotence). However, only compounds from 
 <italic>E. kraussianum</italic> were evaluated until now. In 2002, Drewes et al. investigated the capacity of pyrano-isoflavones 
 <bold>64–68</bold> to relax the 
 <italic>corpus cavernosum</italic> of rabbits. Compounds 
 <bold>64</bold> and 
 <bold>65</bold> displayed a dose-dependent activity, while 
 <bold>66–68</bold> were inactive. At the low concentration of 78 ng/ml, 
 <bold>64</bold> and 
 <bold>65</bold> displayed 85 and 65% of the relaxation found with sildenafil citrate, respectively. Rather to induce relaxation, 
 <bold>66</bold> and 
 <bold>68</bold> caused contraction of 
 <italic>corpus cavernosum</italic> tissue (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Drewes et al., 2004</xref>). Accordingly, the authors indicated that the overall effect of the extract as used in traditional medicine is mainly determined by the activities of 
 <bold>64</bold> and 
 <bold>65</bold>, present as the major constituents.
