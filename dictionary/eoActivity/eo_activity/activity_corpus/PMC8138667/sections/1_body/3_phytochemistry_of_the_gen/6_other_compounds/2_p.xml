<p>Globally the phytochemical investigation of the 
 <italic>Eriosema</italic> genus led to the isolation and/or identification of 107 compounds from only eight species (5.3% of the genus) out of 
 <italic>ca.</italic> 150 (
 <italic>E. chinense</italic>, 
 <italic>E. englerianum</italic>, 
 <italic>E. glomeratum</italic>, 
 <italic>E. kraussianum</italic>, 
 <italic>E. laurentii</italic>, 
 <italic>E. robustum</italic>, 
 <italic>E. tuberosum</italic> and 
 <italic>E. psoraleoides</italic>). Isolated and/or identified constituents are mostly isoflavones (26.2%), flavonols (11.2%), flavanonols (11.2%), flavanones (8.4%) and chromones (7.5%) (

 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Awouafack et al. (2015)</xref> documented flavonoids from 5 
 <italic>Eriosema</italic> species and concluded that the genus represents a rich source of flavonoids, mostly isoflavones which could be considered as markers for the genus and have chemotaxonomic significance. However, given the low number of species investigated until now, the deduction of a chemotaxonomic significance of some of the components seems premature.
