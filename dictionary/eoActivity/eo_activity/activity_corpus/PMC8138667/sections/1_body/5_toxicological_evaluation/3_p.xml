<p>According to 
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">Koné et al. (2012)</xref>, an ethanolic leaf extract of 
 <italic>E. griseum</italic> displayed no toxicity against L6 rat skeletal myoblast cells. 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Awouafack et al. (2013a)</xref>, evaluated the cytotoxicity of an ethanolic twig extract of 
 <italic>E. robustum</italic> and compounds thereof against normal monkey Vero cells. In the MTT assay, the extract showed a low cytotoxicity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 53.45 μg/ml). Among isolates obtained from this extract, 
 <bold>88</bold> and 
 <bold>107</bold> were not cytotoxic, 
 <bold>17</bold>, 
 <bold>41</bold>, 
 <bold>87</bold> and 
 <bold>101</bold> displayed a low cytotoxicity (21.87 ≤ IC
 <sub>50</sub> ≤ 91.52 μg/ml), while 
 <bold>16</bold> was moderately cytotoxic (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 13.20 μg/ml).
