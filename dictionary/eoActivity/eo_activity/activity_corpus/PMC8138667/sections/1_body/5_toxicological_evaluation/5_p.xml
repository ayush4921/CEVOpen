<p>In a study by 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Ateba et al. (2014a)</xref>, the toxicity of a methanol extract of the aerial parts of 
 <italic>E. laurentii</italic> following guidelines for acute (OECD guideline 423) and subchronic (OECD guideline 407) oral administrations was investigated. A single dose of 2 g/kg of the extract as well as the repetition of the experiment, caused neither toxicological symptoms nor mortality and the LD
 <sub>50</sub> was estimated &gt;5 g/kg. In 28-days repeated oral administration, no signs of toxicity were observed phenotypically and in the main organs of rats. The extract only induced a delayed decrease of relative spleen weight and reduced the white blood cell count in males at the highest dose of 400 mg/kg.
