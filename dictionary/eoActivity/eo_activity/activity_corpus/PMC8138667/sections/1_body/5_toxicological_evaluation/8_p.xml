<p>Toxicological evaluations are of major importance for medicinal plants and herbal products. Without these studies the estimation of their therapeutic potential is limited when the doses to induce non-fatal as well as fatal adverse effects are unknown. Based on the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> acute toxicity studies, the tested extracts of 
 <italic>E. chinense</italic>, 
 <italic>E. laurentii</italic> and 
 <italic>E. psoraleoides</italic> are placed at category 5 (or unclassified) in the Globally Harmonized Classification System for Chemical Substances and Mixtures (GHS) as adopted by OECD (
 <xref rid="B134" ref-type="bibr">OECD, 2001</xref>). Such products with no deaths up to 2000 mg/kg (estimated LD
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 5000 mg/kg) are considered practically non-toxic (
