<p>In this paper, we reviewed the available information concerning the traditional uses/ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, pharmacology and toxicology of the genus 
 <italic>Eriosema</italic>. Twenty-five species (âˆ¼16.6% of the genus) recorded in the review are known as traditional medicines and used for nearly 121 ailments. It is evident from anectodical notes that the investigated numbers of species and traditionally treated health problems are so far lower than the reality. Moreover, around 75% of the traditional indications of these plants have not been studied yet in respective pre-clinical studies, indicating that more scientific investigations are necessary. Apart from data on ethnopharmacology, only 49 papers dealing with the phytochemical, pharmacological and toxicological investigation and reviews on 
 <italic>Eriosema</italic> species and compounds occurring in this genus have been published in 25 years (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). The mean rate of approximately 2 publications per year is very low. Despite the high reputation of several species for curing or alleviating ED/impotence, especially in Africa, the investigation is only limited to two papers on 
 <italic>E. kraussianum</italic> which have been published more than 15 years ago indicating an underexplored aspect that requires more research attention. Concerning phytochemistry, the paper covers a total of 107 compounds mainly belonging to the classes of flavonoids, chromones and terpenoids. The pharmacological activities of extracts and pure compounds from this genus focused on the management of erectile dysfunction, pre-eclamptic complications and anti-diabetic, estrogenic, hypolipidemic, anti-oxidant, anti-microbial, anti-osteoporosis, anthelmintic, anti-diarrheal and anti-cancer effects as well as cyclooxygenase and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory properties. However, there is lack of studies dealing with the in-depth mechanisms involved in the observed activities 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and in animals. Moreover, no clinical study has been carried out till now. Beyond the pharmacological activities, the toxicity evaluation of medicinal plants is of high importance for their valorization. 
 <italic>In vivo</italic>, acute toxicity carried out with 
 <italic>E. chinense</italic>, 
 <italic>E. laurentii</italic> and 
 <italic>E. psoraleoides</italic> indicated a low toxicity of investigated extracts.
