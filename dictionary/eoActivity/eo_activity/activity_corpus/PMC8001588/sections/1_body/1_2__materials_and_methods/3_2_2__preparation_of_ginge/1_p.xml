<p>Fresh ginger root was purchased from the local market and then cut into slices. Ginger slices were air-dried (sunshade for 1 day) at room temperature and further oven-dried (at 40 째C for 40 h) (Memmert UNB400). Dehydrated slices were then processed by grinder device (IKA, MF 10 basic) to fine powder, and subsequently stored in moisture-controlled ziplock bags at 4 째C. Ethanolic ginger extract was prepared by mixing 2 g of ginger powder in the 100 mL of absolute ethanol. The mixture was processed for 30 min at 85 째C. The prepared extract was filtered by Whatman No. 1 filter paper. Dry extract (5 g) was dissolved in 10 mL of methanol solvent and sonicated for 30 min at 15 째C. Constituents of the extract were quantified by HPLC (Smartline, Knauer, Germany) method [

The contents of bioactive components were determined in the extract and the concentration of 6-gingerol, 8-gingerol, 10-gingerol, and 6-shogaol was 6163.1, 802.8, 783.9, and 839.9 mg/kg ginger (on dry weight basis), respectively. Nutrient compositions and total phenolic content of ginger root powder were analyzed according to standard method, Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) [
