<p>Ferric reducing antioxidant power assay was used to assess the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) of blood samples [
 <xref rid="B37-ijerph-18-02995" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. TAC was quantified by the reaction of phenanthroline and Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> using a spectrophotometer at 520 nm. TAC is defined as the amount of antioxidants required to increase the absorbance by 0.01, in 1 mL of blood sample at 37 Â°C. Concentration of MDA in the serum, as an index of lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress, was determined using the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) method [
 <xref rid="B37-ijerph-18-02995" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The principle is that TBARS reacts with MDA to form a stable pink color that could be measured spectrophotometrically at 532 nm. The values of MDA were expressed as (nmol/mL).
