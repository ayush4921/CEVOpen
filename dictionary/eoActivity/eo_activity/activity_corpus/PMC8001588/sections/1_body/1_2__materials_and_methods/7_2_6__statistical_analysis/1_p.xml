<p>Data of production performance and egg quality were subjected to one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using MIXED procedure (Repeated Measurement), SAS (version 9) as a completely randomized design [
 <xref rid="B38-ijerph-18-02995" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Tukey multiple comparison test was used to compare the averages at a 5% confidence level. The Shapiroâ€“Wilk and Levene tests were used for model assumptions of homogeneity of variance and normality, respectively. The percentage data including egg mass, egg production rate, yolk index, egg yolk, eggshell and albumen relative weight, and egg shape were transformed by arcsine of the square root before analysis to achieve homogeneity of variance. No statistical difference was observed between the two sets of data thus results of statistical analysis on the original data are presented in this article.
