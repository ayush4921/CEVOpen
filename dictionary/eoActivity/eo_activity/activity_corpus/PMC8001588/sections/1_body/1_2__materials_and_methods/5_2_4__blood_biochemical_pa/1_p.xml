<p>At the end of the experiment, two birds from each replicate were randomly picked up for slaughter (6 birds per treatment). Blood samples were collected from the neck vein of the birds using sterilized needles and then centrifuged for 15 min at 3000 rpm to separate the serum. The collected serum was stored at −20 °C for the analysis of glucose (Catalog No: 117500), albumin (Catalog No: 5017) and total protein (Catalog No: 128500), cholesterol (Catalog No: 110500), and triglycerides (Catalog No: 132500). Blood biochemical parameters were measured by a spectrophotometric analysis, using commercially available kits (Pars Azmun Diagnostic, Tehran, Iran).</p>
