<p>The results of this study suggest that the inclusion of ginger root powder in Japanese quail diet can partially improve the productive performance, antioxidant status, and blood parameters. Moreover, ginger could improve yolk color and albumen quality expressed in Haugh units. The effects on the quail production performance seemed to be dose dependent and ginger at the highest tested level (1.5 g/kg of ginger powder) was most effective treatment. However, further studies are needed to conclude on the effect of ginger on quality of the poultry products as well as its mechanism of action.</p>
