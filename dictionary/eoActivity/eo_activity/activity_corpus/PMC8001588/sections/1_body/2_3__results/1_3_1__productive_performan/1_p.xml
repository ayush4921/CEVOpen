<p>The effect of dietary supplementation with natural additives of ginger powder on the productive performance is presented in 
 <xref rid="ijerph-18-02995-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The results showed that the experimental treatments had no significant effect on egg production rate among the treatments during the experimental period (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). Egg mass and egg weight were not significantly affected by the level of ginger powder used (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). As shown in 
 <xref rid="ijerph-18-02995-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, addition of different levels of ginger significantly reduced feed intake during the whole experimental period (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) compared with the control treatment. Ginger powder had dose-dependent effect since highest concentration of 1.5 g/kg of diet was most the potent treatment. The effect of treatment and time interaction was insignificant on the feed intake, egg weight and egg mass (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). Nonetheless, the treatment x time interaction was significant on the FCR (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). According to our results, 
 <xref rid="ijerph-18-02995-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, GP supplemented diet reduced FCR compared with the control group during experiment period (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). High levels of ginger powder at 1.5 g/kg level decreased FCR compared with other groups. The experimental treatments significantly reduced FCR during breeding weeks. Moreover, the effect of time on the FCR was also significant.
