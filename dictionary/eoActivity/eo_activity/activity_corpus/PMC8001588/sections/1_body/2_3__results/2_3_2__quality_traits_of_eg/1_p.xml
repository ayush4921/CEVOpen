<p>The effects of diet supplementation with different levels of ginger powder on qualitative traits of eggs are given in 
 <xref rid="ijerph-18-02995-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. The results showed that the effects of ginger powder on egg weight, shape index, albumen weight, shell weight, albumen, yolk and shell percentage, yolk pH, and shell thickness and strength were insignificant (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). Ginger supplementation improved yolk index; however, it did not increase yolk weight compared with the control treatment (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). Nonetheless, effect of time on yolk index was significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The highest yolk color was related to the highest level of ginger in the diet. The effect of treatment x time interaction, as shown in 
 <xref rid="ijerph-18-02995-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, were significant on yolk color, albumen height and albumen index during experimental period (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The albumen and yolk pH were significantly reduced by ginger powder experimental diet compared with the control treatment (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Ginger diet improved Haugh unit relative to control group (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), but egg specific gravity (ESG) did not differ (
