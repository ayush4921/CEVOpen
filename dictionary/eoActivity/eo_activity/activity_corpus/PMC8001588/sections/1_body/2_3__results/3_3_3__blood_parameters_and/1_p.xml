<p>The effect of experimental diets on blood parameters of animals are presented in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-18-02995-f001">Figure 1</xref>. The results revealed that supplementation of ginger powder in the diet had significant effect on the level of triacylglycerol (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-18-02995-f001">Figure 1</xref>, was significant (
