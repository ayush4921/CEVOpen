<p>Throughout the production of ginger drink, powder, flakes and or ginger extract, significant amount of process discards, and byproducts are produced every year that could potentially be used as inexpensive feed additive in animal industry [

 <xref rid="B19-ijerph-18-02995" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In a recent study, ginger supplement in broiler chicken diets stimulated the immune and digestive systems of the birds considerably [

 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-18-02995" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] showed that, ginger in combination with probiotic and organic acid (citric acid) in laying Japanese quail diets improved the laying performances, feed conversion ratio (FCR), egg quality, bone characteristics, and reproductive indexes. Accordingly, diet supplementation with ginger powder increased total superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase (Gpx) activities while it reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) and cholesterol concentrations in serum of broiler chickens at 21 and 42 days of age [

 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-18-02995" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. It has been reported that using 4 and 8 g/kg of ginger powder of diet reduced feed intake but improved weight gain compared with control group [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-18-02995" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In a study, ginger powder at 0.05 g/kg of diet, increased the egg production, hatching, reproductive performance, and economic efficiency of Japanese quail [
 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-18-02995" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Other studies have reported that the addition of ginger essential oils at 300 µL/kg of diet, increased egg shell weight and shell thickness in laying hens [
 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-18-02995" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Supplementation of broiler chickens diet with ginger reduced MDA and cholesterol concentration in serum of chickens at 21 and 42 days of age [
 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-18-02995" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The effects of ginger supplementation in diets of broiler chicks at 64 weeks of age at 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6% showed a significant improvement in the feed conversion ratio in the treatment group containing 0.4% ginger powder [
 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-18-02995" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Ibtisham et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-ijerph-18-02995" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] have shown improvement of the production rate and feed intake of ginger powder and Chinese herbal medicine fed laying hens. They also concluded that ginger powder could be a suitable alternative to the antibiotic in poultry feed. In another study, Habibi et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-ijerph-18-02995" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] reported that ginger powder and essential oils may be a vital replacement for synthetic antioxidants in broiler diets. Additionally, these researchers stated that ginger powder might be better than extracted essential oil for improving antioxidant status in broiler. The effect of diet supplementation with extract from thyme and ginger on the egg quality of laying hen was investigated by Damaziak et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-18-02995" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], who demonstrated that hen diet supplementation was improved Haugh unit of albumen and yolk color of fresh and hard boiled eggs. Recent studies suggest that Haugh unit and yolk color are important in the commercial production of table eggs which affected by dietary composition (e.g., protein sources and pigments) [
 <xref rid="B30-ijerph-18-02995" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Color is an important qualitative feature of food acceptability as it affects consumers’ perceptions of quality and flavor helping those making decisions about the purchase. Most consumers find yolk color related to the age and health of the animal and the quality of egg and its derivatives. Generally, edible additives and feeding methods are the main factors in the egg yolk color. For instance, natural pigments of plants such as carotenoids play an important role in the development of egg yolk color [
 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-18-02995" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, to the best of our knowledge, information regarding the potential benefits of these feed additive in the Japanese quail’s diet is limited, so the present study was conducted to evaluate the effects of using different levels of ginger powder on the productive performance, eggs quality, and blood parameters in laying Japanese quails.
