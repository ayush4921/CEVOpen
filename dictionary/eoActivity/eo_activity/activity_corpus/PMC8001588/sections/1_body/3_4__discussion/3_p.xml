<p>Haugh unit, albumen height, and yolk index are characterized as main reference associated with egg quality, which influenced by feed additive (e.g., green tea powder) [
 <xref rid="B60-ijerph-18-02995" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. In this study yolk index, albumen height, and Haugh unit of eggs were increased in diet supplemented with ginger powder. Several studies indicated that ginger supplementation in poultry diets significantly increased antioxidant enzymes as well as TAC and decreased MDA [

 <xref rid="B43-ijerph-18-02995" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Improvement of egg yolk index and Haugh unit in the current study may be due to the effect of the phenolic compounds of ginger (gingerols and shagaol) which have antioxidant properties [

As discussed earlier, color of the yolk an acceptability and freshness feature of the egg, could be improved by natural products such as carotenoids. In this study, egg yolk color was positively affected by ginger powder consumption (1.5 mg/kg). However, others have reported the ineffectiveness of fermented ginger powder (10 and 50 mg/kg of diet concentrations) [

 <xref rid="B42-ijerph-18-02995" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] on the yolk color and yolk and albumen percentage. The intensity of egg yolk color depends on the presence and utilization of pigments in the diet, because laying hens have no ability to produce pigments through their biochemical processes [
 <xref rid="B62-ijerph-18-02995" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The darker yolk color of eggs from quails received ginger is probably due to the natural pigments found in ginger, including 6-dehydrogingerdione, which causes a deep yellow color [
 <xref rid="B63-ijerph-18-02995" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. No difference in other quality traits of quail eggs indicates that ginger does not affect the egg shell quality or egg composition (percentage of albumen, yolk, and shell). The results of present experiment consistent with the result of Wen et al. 2019 [
 <xref rid="B42-ijerph-18-02995" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] showing that the use of ginger root as an additive in Japanese quail diet had significant effect on Haugh unit and albumen height yet being ineffective on shell thickness, shell strength, and egg composition percentage. We, in this study, observed concentration dependent potency of ginger powder on many important parameters of fresh egg quality (e.g., Haugh unit, yolk index, and yolk color) in laying quails; however, other variables associated with egg shelf life should be tested for a final statement.
