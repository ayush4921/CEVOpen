<p id="Par25">Despite its importance, the argan biosphere agroforestry system is ecologically fragile, and its durability is threatened mainly by anthropogenic impacts and climate change. In mountains, the main factors of degradation are overgrazing and overexploitation (Noua√Øm et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">1991</xref>; Nouaim et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2002</xref>). In Souss and Chtouka plains, the expansion of irrigated and intensive agriculture has caused a drastic decrease of groundwater resources and induced dramatic degradation of natural resources. Droughts, overgrazing, and urbanization constitute a major cause of the decrease of natural resources in the west-central Morocco (El Abidine

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2016</xref>; Chakhchar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2017</xref>). Several studies conducted in the region have reported widespread degradation in the argan forest since the first part of the twentieth century (Boudy 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1958</xref>; Monnier 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">1965</xref>). Indeed, almost one-half of the argan forest disappeared during the twentieth century and average density of argan trees dropped by around 70% from 100 to less than 30 trees per hectare (Lybbert et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2011</xref>). Alifriqui (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2004</xref>), showed that 240 000 ha of argan forest disappeared between 1918 and 1945. In the Souss plain, El Yousfi (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1988</xref>) showed that 45% of argan forests were opened to cultivation between 1969 and 1986, which caused the disappearance of 500 ha/year. In the Aoulouz region, the argan forest decreased by 44.5% and forest density decrease from an average of 27.4 trees/ha to 15.2 trees/ha between 1970 and 2007 (Le Polain de Waroux and Lambin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2012</xref>). Germination of argan seedlings is strongly compromised, in fact the seeds harvesting is systematic (Lybbert et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2001</xref>; Belghazi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2007</xref>). Thus, argan trees can be assessed as vulnerable species.
