<p>The green color of mango is due to the presence of chlorophyll. Two types of chlorophylls are found in mango fruit: chlorophyll a provides a blue-green color and chlorophyll b provides a yellow-green; these are present in a 3:1 ratio [

Chlorophyll content decrease increases the carotenoid concentration in the pulp and peel of the fruit, and the color changes from green to golden yellow, red, or orange, depending on the variety. The chlorophyll content can be decreased by ethylene and by up-regulation of de novo synthesis of the chlorophyllase enzyme [
