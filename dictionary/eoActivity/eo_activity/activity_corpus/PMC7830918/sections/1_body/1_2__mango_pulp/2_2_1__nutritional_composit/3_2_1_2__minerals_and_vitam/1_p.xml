<p>Vitamins and minerals are important micronutrients present in mango pulp. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) database, mango pulp comprises four different types of water- and fat-soluble vitamins. The concentrations of vitamins A and C are higher compared to those of vitamins B, E, and K (

Similar to the sugar content, the organic acid type and content changes as the fruit matures, being also dependent on the locality and species. The quantity of vitamin C ranges from 98 mg to 18 g/kg; thus, consumption of mango on regular basis could fulfill the recommended dietary intake of vitamins C and A [

 <xref rid="B39-ijerph-18-00741" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] reported 36.4 mg/100 g of vitamin C, on average, in mango pulp (

The concentration of vitamin A ranges from 1000–6000 IU, and the consumption of one fresh fruit (250–300 g) provide 10–12% the recommended daily amount (RDA) of retinol. Mango consumption is thus one of the best ways to prevent vitamin A deficiency [

 <xref rid="B42-ijerph-18-00741" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Compared to vitamin A, vitamin E and K concentrations are lower in mango pulp. Their amounts also increase as the fruit ripens. Conversely, Indian varieties like Deshahari possess low levels of vitamin E in mature fruit [
 <xref rid="B43-ijerph-18-00741" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Fresh mango pulp (100 g) contains roughly 1.3 mg of α-tocopherol, an active form of vitamin E. [

 <xref rid="B45-ijerph-18-00741" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The vitamin B complex is important for both plant and human metabolism and nutrition. The mango pulp contains all the B complex vitamins except biotin. The B complex vitamin content in mango changes as the fruit matures, ranging from 1.5–2.5 mg/100 g of fresh fruit pulp [
 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-18-00741" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Mango pulp is a good source of elemental minerals that are essential for a variety of biochemical reactions. The consumption of mango provides amounts of many micro- and macrominerals such as calcium, sodium, copper, iron, phosphorus, manganese, magnesium, zinc, boron (0.6–10.6 mg/kg), and selenium (
