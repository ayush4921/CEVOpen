<p>Mango pulp is known to have low amounts of lipids and fatty acids, but the mango seed is a rich source of lipids. Vilela et al. [
 <xref rid="B65-ijerph-18-00741" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] analyzed the lipid profiles in twelve 
 <italic>M. indica</italic> L. cultivars grown on Madeira Island using GC-MS, and reported similar quantity and quality compositions of free and glycosylated sterols (44.8–70.7%) and fatty acids (22.6–41.9%) in the total lipophilic component. Vilela et al. [
 <xref rid="B65-ijerph-18-00741" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] further identified lower quantities of long-chain aliphatic alcohols and α-tocopherol. These findings revealed that the consumption of 100 g of fresh mango can significantly benefit health by providing 9.5–38.2 mg of phytosterols (free and glycosylated) and 0.7–3.9 mg of ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acids.
