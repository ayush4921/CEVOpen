<p>Mango contains different types of carbohydrates based on the stage of maturity. Ripe mango is a rich a source of sugars (fructose, glucose, sucrose), whereas unripe mango is a source of starch and pectin. During the ripening process, starch is converted to fructose and glucose. The increase in mono- and disaccharide concentrations upon maturation is observed in many varieties, including Alphonso [
