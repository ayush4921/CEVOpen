<p>The important phytochemicals with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, including ascatechins, quercetin, anthocyanins, kaempferol, rhamnetin, and tannic acid, belong to a class of flavonoids. A high proportion of quercetin and its glycosides (46.6 mg/kg) and lower quantities of kaempferol, rhamnetin, myricetin, and fistien are present in the fresh mango pulp [

 <xref rid="B56-ijerph-18-00741" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Among the condensed tannins and pro-anthocyanins, catechin presents in higher concentrations (1.72 ± 1.57 mg per 100 g fresh weight (FW)) compared to epicatechin (0.15 ± 0.0 mg per 100 g FW). In addition to the above pro-anthocyanin monomers, mango pulp contains dimers, trimers and tetra-hexamer compounds [
