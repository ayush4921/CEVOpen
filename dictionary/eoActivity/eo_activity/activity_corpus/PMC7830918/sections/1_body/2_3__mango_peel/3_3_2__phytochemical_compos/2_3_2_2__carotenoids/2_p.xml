<p>Anthocyanins are water-soluble pigments; their presence provides red, blue, and purple colors to the fruits. These are presently used as biocolorants instead of synthetic colors [

 <xref rid="B80-ijerph-18-00741" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Different ranges of anthocyanin concentrations have been reported by different authors. For example, total anthocyanin content ranges from 3600–5650 µg/g dry weight (DW) in the fully ripe stage and from 2030–3260 µg/g in the raw and unripe stages [

 <xref rid="B54-ijerph-18-00741" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] reported very low anthocyanin content (0.21–3.71 µg/g DW) in some red-colored mangoes (Tommy Atkins). Ranganath et al. [
 <xref rid="B75-ijerph-18-00741" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] observed the highest anthocyanin content in red-colored mango peels (228.2 µg/100 g FW) compared to yellow- and green-colored mango peels. The major anthocyanins observed in different-colored peels of the various cultivars of mangoes include cyanidin, pelargonidin, delphinidin, malvidin, petunidin, and peonidin.
