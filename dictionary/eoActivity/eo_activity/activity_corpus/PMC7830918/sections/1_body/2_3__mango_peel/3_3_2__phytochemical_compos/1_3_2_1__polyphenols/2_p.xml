<p>In the peels of Tommy Atkins cultivar, 18 gallotannins were identified; the total concentration was 1.4 mg/g dry weight, expressed as gallic acid equivalents (GAE). The identified gallotannins are galloyl-glucose and quercetin derivatives. The major quercetins are quercetin-3-O-galactoside, quercetin-3-O-xyloside, quercetin-3-O-glucoside, quercetin-3-O-arabinofuranoside, and quercetin-3-O-arabinopyranoside [

Seven phenolic acid derivatives, three procyanidin dimers, and four xanthenes (homomangiferin, mangiferin, and mangiferin gallate), in a total of 13 compounds, were identified in the Pica peel [
