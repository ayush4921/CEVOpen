  <italic>Caesalpinia digyna</italic> (Rottl.) (Family: Fabaceae) is an essential medicinal plant for it's conventional uses against a kind of human disorders. This research aims to investigate the antidiarrheal, antibacterial and antifungal properties of the methanol extract of the stems extracts of the 
  <italic>C. digyna</italic> (MECD). The 
  <italic>in vivo</italic> antidiarrheal activity of the stem extracts were evaluated by using castor oil-induced diarrhea, castor oil-induced enteropooling and charcoal induced intestinal transit in mice model. Besides, 
  <italic>in vitro</italic> antimicrobial potentiality of MECD was investigated by the disc diffusion method. 
  <italic>In silico</italic> activity of the isolated compounds were performed by Schrödinger-Maestro (Version 11.1) software. In addition, The ADME/T analysis and PASS prediction were implemented by using pass online tools. In the antidiarrheal investigation, the MECD exhibited a notable inhibition rate in all test approaches which were statistically significant (
  <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, 
  <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.1, 
  <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). MECD 400 mg/kg showed the maximum antidiarrheal potency in all the test methods. 
  <italic>In vitro</italic> antimicrobial analysis unveiled that, MECD revealed higher potentiality against almost all pathogens and indicates dose-dependent activity against almost all the bacteria and fungi. In the case of 
  <italic>in silico</italic> evaluation of anti-diarrheal, anti-bacterial and anti-fungal activity, all three isolated compounds met the pre-conditions of Lipinski's five rules for drug discovery. Pass predicted study also employed for all compounds. However, The chemical constituents of the 
  <italic>C. digyna</italic> can be a potent source of anti-diarrheal, anti-bacterial and anti-fungal medicine and further modification and simulation studies are required to establish the effectiveness of bioactive compounds.
