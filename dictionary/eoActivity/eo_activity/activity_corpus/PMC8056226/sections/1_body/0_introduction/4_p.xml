 <italic>Caesalpinia digyna</italic> (Family: Fabaceae) is an evergreen shrub which is well known to the ethnic society owing to it's numerical medicinal values. This shrub is also known as Teri Pod, vakerimul and Udakiryaka. This plant is distributed in India, Bruma, Nepal, Bangladesh and China but in Bangladesh the availability of this plant is rare [
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The herb has been used to prepare a native therapeutic product “Geriforte” which is very effective in the treatment of senile pruritis. Ancient Indian practitioners had found that, this herb have an antipyretic, tonic, astringent and respiratory disease ailment power [
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The pods of 
 <italic>C. digyna</italic> popularly called “teri pods” have approximately 28% tannin, the tannin in the bark is also 28%, while seed pods have over 54% tannin. The tannin is pure tannin of Gallo and gallic acid. Caesalpinin A, cellallocinnine, ellagic acid, gallic acid, bergenin, bonducellin, intricatinol and tannins were found to be present as a phytoconstituents of 
 <italic>C. digyna</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The structures of intricatinol,E−8-methoxybonducelline, bonducelline, isointricatinol, Z-8 methoxybonducelline, e-eucomine, z‐eucomine, caesalpinine A, and caesalpinine C were isolated from 
 <italic>C. digyna</italic> [

 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The compound namely 2,3,Dihydro-7-hydroxy-3- [(4methoxyphenyl) Methylene]-4 H-1benzopyran-4-one has been isolated from the twigs and leaves of this plant [
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Petroleum ether extract of 
 <italic>C. digyna</italic> root was phytochemically examined and four compounds - friedelin, hexacosanoic acid, β-sitosterol and stigmasterol were isolated [
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The EtOAc fraction of the MeOH extract of 
 <italic>C. digyna</italic> roots were examined through the chromatogram and a new homoisoflavoid, Isointricatinol (1), with eight well-established homoisoflavonoids, three flavonoids, bergenine and 11-O-galloylbergenin were also extracted. In the ancient studies, the root of the 
 <italic>C. digyna</italic> was found to treat diabetes and fever [
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The powder of this shrub also used by numerous ethnic tribes of the India and Bangladesh in treating diarrhea and other chronic fluxes. 
 <italic>C. digyna</italic> is accounted for the managements of senile pruritis, diarrhea, tuberculosis, tonic disorder, diabetes, etc; [

 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Despite extensive plant use, however, biological study has not yet been undertaken on pharmacological and phytochemical aspects to help their traditional use. In this present study, in an attempt to rationalize its indigenous use, the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies were conducted to investigate the phytochemical, antimicrobial and antidiarrheal efficacy of methanol extract of 
 <italic>C. digyna</italic> stems (MECD) in different experimental approaches. Besides, an advanced computational analysis has been propagated to the characterization of its isolated compounds by applying ADME/T, pass prediction, and molecular docking simulation.
