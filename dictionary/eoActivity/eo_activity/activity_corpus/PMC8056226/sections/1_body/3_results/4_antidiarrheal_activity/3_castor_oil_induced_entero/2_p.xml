<p id="p0160">With the treatment of MECD, the volume and weight of intestinal substance were significantly (

 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The most elevated impact on both volume and weight of intestinal substance was accomplished at dose 400 mg/kg of body weight. The percent of inhibition was increased with the elevation of the dose concentration of MECD. The test samples were compared to control (1% Tween-80) and findings were contrasted with standard drug loperamide (3 mg/kg). The mean weight of small intestine content (MWSIC) and mean volume of small intestine content (MVSIC) were calculated for each test sample. The percent inhibition of MECDs were found to be 11.66%, 36.67%, 55.00%, 71.66% in MWSIC 50, 100, 200, 400 mg/kg respectively and the percent inhibition of MVSIC were found to be 8.33%, 37.50%, 54.16%, 64.58% for MECD 50, 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg respectively. On the contrary, the percent of inhibition rate of loperamide (3 mg/kg) were showed 71.66% in MWSIC and 72.91% in MVSIC respectively. Different parameter of castor oil-induced enteropooling has been listed in
