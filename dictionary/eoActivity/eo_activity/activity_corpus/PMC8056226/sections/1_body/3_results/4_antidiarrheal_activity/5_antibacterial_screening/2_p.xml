<p id="p0170">The methanol extract of 
 <italic>C. digyna</italic> stems yielded very potent activities against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Evaluation of antibacterial activity was illustrated in 
 <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. With the elevation of several concentration, MECD showed sustainable action against almost all the treated bacteria (except 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>). From the tabular analysis of MECD against eight pathogenic bacteria, it can be suggested that 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> strain is resistant to MECD extract and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacilllus casei, Bacillus azotoformans, Corynebacterium species, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli, strains</italic> are potentially susceptible to MECD. 
 <italic>Bacillus azotoformans, Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Salmonella typhi</italic> elevated better sensitivity to MECD extracts than others. Maximum zone of inhibition (26.33 ± 0.88 mm) was attained by the MECD extract at 500 (μg/disc) concentration against 
 <italic>Bacillus azotoformans</italic> among all the gram-positive bacteria and in opposition to 
 <italic>Bacillus azotoformans</italic> and as well as all the gram-negative bacteria, maximum zone of inhibition (25.66 ± 1.20 mm) was attained by 
 <italic>Salmonella typhi</italic> at 500 (μg/disc).
