<p id="p0180">The MECD extract yielded significant susceptibility against almost all the fungi. From the investigation, it can be narrated that, 
 <italic>Blastomyces dermatitidis</italic> strain has remarkable susceptibility to MECD extract. The maximum zone of inhibition for 
 <italic>Blastomyces dermatitidis</italic> was revealed 21.34 ± 0.89 mm in diameter at MECD 500 μg/disc and the minimum zone of inhibition was revealed 10.67 ± 0.67 mm for 
 <italic>Trichoderma</italic> spp. at MECD 100 μg/disc. The maximum and minimum zone of inhibition for 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> have been measured 20.66 ± 0.67 and 12.67 ± 0.61 (mm) at MECD 500 and 100 (μg/disc) respectively where flucloxacillin 20 μg/disc has inhibited 32.66 ± 0.66 mm for the same strain. The Appraisal of antifungal susceptibility was illustrated in
