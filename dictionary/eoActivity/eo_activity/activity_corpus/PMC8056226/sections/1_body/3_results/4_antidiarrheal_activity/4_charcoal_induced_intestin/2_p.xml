<p id="p0165">In primary treatment, MECD repressed the intestinal travel of charcoal meal at all the treated dosages. The investigation revealed that the rate of gastrointestinal travel of charcoal was decreased with the elevation of test doses respectively. The data revealed that the percentage reduction of gastrointestinal transit of charcoal was 12.21 % (

Besides the percent of inhibition of MECD, the total length of the small intestine, distance moved by the charcoal in the small intestine and peristaltic index (%) were also calculated. All the findings have been listed in
