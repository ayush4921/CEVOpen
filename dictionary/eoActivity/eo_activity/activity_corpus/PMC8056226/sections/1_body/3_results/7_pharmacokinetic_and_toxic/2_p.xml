<p id="p0195">The properties of ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) of the isointricatinol, isobonducellin, and Z-eucomine have been displayed in 
 <xref rid="tbl11" ref-type="table">Table 11</xref>. The chosen properties are remarkable to dominance cell permeation, metabolism and bioavailability. Here, in consonance with Lipinski's rule of five, predicted properties of all three compounds met within the range, which is considered to predict as drug-like potential. Moreover, in case of toxicological properties of these selected compounds, the study exhibited that these compounds were non-carcinogenic and non-Ames toxicities.
