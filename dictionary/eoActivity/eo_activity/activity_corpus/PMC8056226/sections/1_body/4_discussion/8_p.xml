<p id="p0230">We have further established the pharmacokinetic/drug likeliness and toxicological properties of the selected compounds because these interpretations were significantly intended as essential considerations for the development of a new drug, clinical trial, and biological review of the isolated compounds [
 <xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Throughout this case, the pharmacokinetic properties of the major compounds of 
 <italic>C. digyna</italic> were determined by using an online method (SwissADME), which was based on the Lipinski five rules. Lipinski's rule of 5 reports that the molecular weight of an orally administered drug/compounds should be &lt; 500 amu, the value of lipophilicity is ≤ 5, hydrogen bond acceptors &lt;5, and the hydrogen bonds donor is ≤ 10. When any drugs or compounds break this rule, the bioavailability of the compound can be questionable [
 <xref rid="bib85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. The findings suggest all compounds met the requirements of Lipinski's five rules, suggesting that these compounds are effective drug candidates and potentially preferable for oral use. Besides, we have used the admetSAR online tool to evaluate the toxicological properties of the selected phytochemicals, as the safety of the compounds is an important parameter for becoming a good drug [
