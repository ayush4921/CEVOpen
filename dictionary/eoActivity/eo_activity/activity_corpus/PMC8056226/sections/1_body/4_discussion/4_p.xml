<p id="p0210">Enteropooling model was aimed to assess the secretary components of diarrhea. In this model, the MECD extract showed significant retardation in both MWSIC and MVSIC at all tested doses as compared to control. In the present study, it has been characterized that castor oil is liable to the diarrheal activity because of containing nitric oxide in it. This diarrheal effectiveness includes reduction of general liquid misappropriation by obstruction of intestinal Na⁺, K⁺ ATPase activity enactment of adenylate cyclase or mucosal cAMP intervened dynamic secretion [
