 <italic>Psidium guajava</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] are frequently used for the treatment of diarrhea [
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The intrinsic antidiarrheal and antimicrobial potentials of these medicinal plants were evaluated by a particular choice of medicinal plant (employed ethnopharmacological survey) [
 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. A realistic approach with specific animal behavioral methods is necessary to produce a top-class herbal antidiarrheal product. Thoughincredible animal models are available for pharmacological study, each model has its benefits and disadvantages [
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Syndrome-based methods, novel animal experiments, and well-established research can thus lead to a credible preclinical and clinical conclusion that are either suitable or equivalent to the treatment of pathologic diarrhea and microbial disease [
 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The lack of effective and safe medication and the rising resistance of pathogens to available antibiotics or anti-parasitic agents are more challenging issues for developing countries. Infectious diarrhea, enteric bacterial pathogens, and parasites are a typical form of these diseases [
