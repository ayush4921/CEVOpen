<p id="p0225">Studies on molecular docking have been widely used to forecast ligand-target interactions and to gain a deeper understanding of natural products' biological activity. It also provides additional insights on potential mechanisms of action and binding mechanisms within the binding pockets of different proteins [
 <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. To consider the fact, a molecular docking study has been conducted to explain and validate the experimental results found in biological study. The experimental findings are confirmed in this process. Three representative molecules within the 
 <italic>C. digyna</italic> were chosen for docking study in order to gain a deeper insight regarding the witness of biological activity (antidiarrheal, antibacterial, and antifungal). These compounds were then docked against fifteen targets for antidiarrheal, antibacterial, and antifungal study respectively. In antidiarrheal molecular docking study, several amino acid residues reacted by the hydrogen bonds with selected compounds resulting in docking values between - 5.02 and - 8.70 kcal/mol. From those findings, it can be inferred that, by interactions with these target proteins, the phytoconstituents are significantly responsible for the antidiarrheal activity. Besides, in the antibacterial docking study, molecular docking with the selected receptors has been accomplished and after interactions between the bioactive compounds and enzymes, the docking score has been assumed ranging from - 3.85 to - 9.42 kcal/mol. These findings indicate that the selected compounds have very high antibacterial potential. Among all the compounds isobonducellin have shown the highest docking score against Cytochrome P450 14 alpha-sterol demethylase (PDB ID:

The results has been compared to the respective standard drugs and finding yeilded more potent binding affinity (receptor – ligand) than the standard drugs.
