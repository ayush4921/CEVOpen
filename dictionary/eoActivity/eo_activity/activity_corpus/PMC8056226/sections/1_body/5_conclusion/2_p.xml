<p id="p0240">The study is to validate the application of methanol extract of 
 <italic>caesapinia digyna</italic> (Rottl.) stems as an antidiarrheal substance used in conventional folk medicine in Bangladesh. In our investigation, it is almost clear that MECD can be another fountain of antibacterial and antifungal agents against several pathogenic strains. It is additionally assumed that, the antimicrobial effect of MECD may be associated with flavonoid and the phenolic compound which also incites antidiarrheal activity. Furthermore, we can state that, this present theoretical work of three isolated compounds from 
 <italic>Caesalphinia digyna</italic> (Rottl.) stems can be useful in the studies of the next experimental work. Therefore, further investigations are suggested to isolate and identify other dynamic constituents in charge of antimicrobial and antidiarrheal potential.
