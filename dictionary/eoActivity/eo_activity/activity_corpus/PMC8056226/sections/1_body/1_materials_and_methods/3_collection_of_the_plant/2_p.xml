<p id="p0060">Owing to implement the pharmacological and phytochemical analysis of the stems of C. digyna, the test sample (stems) were collected from the shita pahar, prashanti, kaptai, Chittagong, Bangladesh in February 2019. Sajib Rudra, a taxonomist from the Department of Botany, Chittagong University, Bangladesh 4331, performed an effective plant test identification and confirmed the authenticity of the plant (Accession number: CTGUH SR 2793). The stems were washed and dried in the natural shade at 23 ± 2 °C for approximately fourteen days. The seedlings were then dried in the oven for 1 h for better grinding at significantly low temperature (40 °C). The dried stems were then crashed into the powder by using a high capacity granular machine. The powdered materials were placed in a well-closed plastic jar and stored in a cool, and dark place.</p>
