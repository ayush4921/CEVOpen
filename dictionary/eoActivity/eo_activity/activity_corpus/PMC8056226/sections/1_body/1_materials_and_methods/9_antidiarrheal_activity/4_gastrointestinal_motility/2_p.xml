<p id="p0100">This assessment was carried out by following the method previously performed by Rudra et al.; [
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Mice were fasted for 18 h and isolated into six groups comprising of six mice in each. Castor oil was fed orally to these mice to initiate diarrhea. 1-hour later group I received vehicles (distilled water containing 1 % tween 80 orally), group II received standard drug (loperamide 3 mg/kg body weight, p.o) and group III, group IV, group V and group VI (test groups) were treated with a suspension of MECD at the oral dose of 50, 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg body weight, respectively. 1 h after oral administration of MECD, animals received 1 mL of the charcoal meal (10% charcoal suspension in 5% gum acacia) orally. 1 h later, the animals were sacrificed by an overdose of chloroform anesthesia and the distance moved by the charcoal meal from the pylorus to caecum was estimated and the total intestinal transit by charcoal meal was designated. The peristaltic index and percentage of inhibition were estimated by using the executed formula.
