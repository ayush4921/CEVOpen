<p id="p0105">The antibacterial examination was carried out by disc diffusion protocol which was previously described by Alam et al.; [
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The disc diffusion process is profoundly effective for the rapid growth of microorganisms. The microorganisms were collected as pure cultures from the International Islamic University Chittagong, Chittagong-4000, Bangladesh). A definite quantity of the test sample was dissolved in a different solvent to obtain a particular concentration (μg/mL). At that point, the sterile filter paper discs having 5 mm in diameter were impregnated with known amounts of the test substances and dried. Such discs and standard antibiotic discs were set on the plate containing an appropriate medium (nutrient agar) seeded with the test organisms. These plates were kept at decreased temperature (4 °C) for 24 h to permit maximum diffusion. The test materials diffuse from the plate to the surrounding medium as per the physical law that controls the diffusion of molecules through agar media. The plates were then kept in an incubator (37 °C) for 18–24 h to allow the growth of organisms. If the test materials have antibacterial action, it will hinder the growth of microorganisms having a clear distinct zone, narrated “Zone of Inhibition”. The antibacterial action of the test sample is determined by estimating the diameter of the zone of inhibition in terms of mm. Amoxicillin 30 (mg/disc) was used as a reference standard. Each experiment was repeated three times.
