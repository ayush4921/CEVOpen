<p id="p0090">The related method by Shoba et al. [
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]; was followed with slight modification to perform this study. The mice were screened initially by giving 0.5 mL of castor oil and only those indicating diarrhea were chosen for the examination. The test animals affixed overnight with free access to water were randomly allocated to six groups comprising of six mice in each group. The animals of group I (control) received vehicles only (distilled water containing 1% Tween-80). Group-II (positive control/standard drug) received a standard anti-motility drug named loperamide (3 mg/kg body weight) as an oral suspension. Group III, group IV, group V and group VI (test groups) were treated with a suspension of MECD at the oral dose of 50, 100, 200 and 400 (mg/kg body weight) respectively. One hour after administration of test samples, all mice received 0.5 mL of castor oil and afterward, they were independently placed in enclosure's floor of which was fixed with transparent paper. During the observational period, the onset of diarrhea, number and weight of wet stools, the total number and the total weight of fecal yields were recorded. Finally, the percent of diarrheal inhibition (% inhibition of defecation) was determined by using the formula described below.
