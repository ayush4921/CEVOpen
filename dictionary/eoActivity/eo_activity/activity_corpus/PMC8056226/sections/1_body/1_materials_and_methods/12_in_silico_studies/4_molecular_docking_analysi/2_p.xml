<p id="p0130">Using Glide embedded in Schrödinger-Maestro version 11.1, generation of grid and docking test were accomplished [
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In Glide, grids were produced according to the default parameters: van der Waals scaling factor 1.00 and charge cutoff 0.25, designed to the OPLS_2005 force field. A cubic box of particular dimensions centered on the centroid of the active site residues was obtained for the receptor, and the size of the box was set to 14 Å × 14 Å × 14 Å for docking. Molecular docking studies were evaluated by recording the best-docked pose for each ligand with the lowest glide score.
