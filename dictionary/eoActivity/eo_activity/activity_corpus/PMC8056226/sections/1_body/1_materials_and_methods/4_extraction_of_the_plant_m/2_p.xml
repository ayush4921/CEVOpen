The jar with its materials were wrapped with an aluminum foil and continued intermittent shaking and mixing for 14 days at 23 ± 2 °C. The whole mixture was then filtered through the cotton and followed by no. 1 Whatman twin-ring filter paper (Bibby RE200 Sterilin Ltsd., UK) and subsequently the mixure was condensed on the water bath at 40 °C, so that the solvent can be evaporated. The extract weight from the stalks was 13 g. In the refrigerator, the crude extract was stored under 4 °C.</p>
