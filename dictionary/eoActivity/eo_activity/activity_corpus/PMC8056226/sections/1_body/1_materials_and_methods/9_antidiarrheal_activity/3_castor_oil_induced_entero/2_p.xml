<p id="p0095">Intraluminal liquid accumulation technique was previously performed by Rudra et al. [
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]; has been followed. 18 h fasted mice were isolated into six groups of six animals in each group. The animals of group I (control) received vehicles only (distilled water containing 1% Tween-80). Group II (positive control/standard) received standard antimotility drug loperamide (3 mg/kg body weight, p.o) as an oral suspension. The group III, group IV, group V and group VI (test group) were treated with a suspension of MECD at the oral dose of 50, 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg of body weight, respectively. At that point 1 h later, 0.5 mL of castor oil was administered orally to these animals to produce diarrhea. After 2 h, the mice were sacrificed by an overdose of chloroform anesthesia, and the small intestinal tract was ligated both at the pyloric sphincter and at the ileocecal junctions and deserted out. The small intestinal tract was weighed and the intestinal substances were collected by draining into a graduated tube and the volume was estimated. The intestines were reweighed and the fluctuations among full and void intestinal tracts were determined and the findings were contrasted to the average effect of the vehicle. Finally, the percent of intestinal secretion and weight of intestinal substances were determined by using the accompanying equations.
