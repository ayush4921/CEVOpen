<p id="p0115">Antifungal sensitivity test of the MECD was also performed by using the disc diffusion assay mentioned by Espinel-Ingroff A et al. [
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]; and the whole testing procedure was carried out as the antibacterial activity test. The only difference was that the period of incubation was 72 h at 25 °C temperature. Potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium was used to perform the antifungal activity and for the subculture of the test organisms. The antifungal activity of the MECD was determined by converting the zone of inhibition (mm) of the 4 pathogens to percent zone of inhibition and subsequent counting total zone of inhibition (TZI) caused by the test groups in comparison to the standard drug Fluconazole.
