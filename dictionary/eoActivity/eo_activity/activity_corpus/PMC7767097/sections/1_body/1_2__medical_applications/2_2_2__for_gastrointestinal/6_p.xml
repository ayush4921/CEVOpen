<p>The use of mints to treat cholera is described in several medical texts, with the first being once again attributed to Pliny [
 <xref rid="B17-biology-09-00484" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. For cholera, Paulus Aegineta advised drinking ‘juice of pomegranate sprinkled with mint’ [
 <xref rid="B31-biology-09-00484" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Sydenham used mint as a component of a nourishing drink for cholera patients [
 <xref rid="B47-biology-09-00484" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Physician William Currie (1754–1828) who, in the 19th century described the disease in his work 
 <italic>Of the Cholera</italic>, also used mints as therapeutic herbs. He also recommended using peppermint water as a palliative treatment for digestive and spasmodic problems and mentioned the activity of mints’ oils against a multitude of pathogenic microorganisms, including 
 <italic>Vibrio cholera</italic>, the causative agent of cholera [
 <xref rid="B67-biology-09-00484" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Recent studies have shown that the essential oils of several mint species have shown in vitro activity against 
 <italic>Echinococcus</italic>, 
 <italic>Trichostrongylidae</italic>, and roundworm parasites [

 <xref rid="B70-biology-09-00484" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], as well as in vivo activity against
