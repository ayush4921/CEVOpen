<p>Gout is an inflammatory arthropathy characterized by the painful swelling of joints resulting from the precipitation of uric acid crystals. Mints are among the several types of treatment tried for this disease throughout history. Pliny exalted the usefulness of pennyroyal for treating gout, presumably by covering the affected body region with the herb [

Sydenham, having himself been afflicted with gout in the last years of his life, made very accurate descriptions of the disease and included mints in several electuaries (i.e., medicines, generally in powder, mixed in with a palatable medium) form to be taken by patients, as well as for rheumatism [

 <italic>in vitro</italic>, an enzyme involved in the formation of uric acid, as well as in generating oxidative stress that contributes to the pathophysiology of the disease [

The local anesthetic effect of mints is attributed mainly to volatile monoterpene menthol which, at low concentrations, activates receptors on cold nervous fibers by creating a perception of coolness, whereas it is irritating at high concentrations [
