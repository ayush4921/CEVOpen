<p>Mints were also valued for their scent in the Black Plague pandemic of the Middle Ages, which decimated at least one third of the European population. During this period, a vinegar-based formulation against the Black Plague called the “Four Thieves Vinegar” is thought to have originated in Medieval France, created by thieves that plundered the dead and dying plague victims. It is thought that, because they smeared this formulation on their skin, they were able to come in contact with their victims without being themselves affected [

In this time period, it was still believed that (infectious) diseases were spread by miasmas, disease carrying vapors that emanated from corpses and decaying matter or from the breath of infected persons, a theory introduced by Hippocrates and Galen [

 <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic> was made centuries later. For these reasons, it is more logical that mints were added for their ability to offset pestilent odors rather than for their flea-repellant property; in fact, recent studies suggest that mint oils show only a weak flea repellant activity [
