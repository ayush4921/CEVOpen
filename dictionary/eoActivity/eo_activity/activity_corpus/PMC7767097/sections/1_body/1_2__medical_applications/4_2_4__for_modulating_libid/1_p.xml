<p>Reports of mints’ effects on libido are diverse and often controversial. This may be partly explained by the differences in used species and also in the quality and quantity consumed. An obvious consensus was reached by classical philosophers that watermint was aphrodisiac. This notion was shared by Aristotle, Dioscorides, Galen, and, centuries later, by the Persian polymath Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi (Rhases, 854–925) [

Recent animal and clinical studies agree that ingestion of mints have an anti-androgenic effect in males, which might affect erection and may also decrease libido [
