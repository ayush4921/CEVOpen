<p>The best-known use of mint herbs for female health undoubtedly comes from their recognized effect of increasing uterine contractile strength (i.e., oxytocic). They were used as emmenagogues, especially in the clinical context of dysmenorrhea. Galen (129–c. 210), in his 
 <italic>On the Mixtures and Powers of Simple Drugs</italic>, suggested using watermint and pennyroyal as complementary treatments to bloodletting, a popular treatment for plethoric ailments, and mentioned that they ‘bring on an abundant menstrual flow’ [
 <xref rid="B75-biology-09-00484" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Centuries later, Luis de Mercado (1525–1611), physician to Phillip II of Spain, also listed pennyroyal as an herb to relieve menstrual retention [
 <xref rid="B76-biology-09-00484" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. The most popular mint for its abortifacient properties was pennyroyal, which has been featured in numeral medical treatises, as well in mythological texts. In the Homeric 
 <italic>Hymn to Demeter</italic>, there is a reference to a recipe for 
 <italic>kykeon</italic>, a porridge containing honey-sweet wine, barley, water, and pennyroyal that was drunk by the goddess Demeter herself. This reference is probably a connotation between pennyroyal and female health and sexuality, but whether it precedes the medical use of the herb or was responsible for it is still a matter of discussion [
 <xref rid="B77-biology-09-00484" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Pliny described pennyroyal and other mints as being capable of increasing uterine contractions and to ‘help expel the placenta and a dead fetus’ [
 <xref rid="B17-biology-09-00484" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], a belief later repeated by Dioscorides [
 <xref rid="B78-biology-09-00484" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Quintus Serenus Sammonicus (d. 212), the Roman author of 
 <italic>Liber Medicinalis</italic>, a didactic poem on medicine, advised administering pennyroyal in tepid water to induce abortion in women with pregnancies less than 1 month old and whose ‘embryo was weak’ [
 <xref rid="B79-biology-09-00484" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>], a practice also mentioned in Odo de Magnudensis’ work [
 <xref rid="B61-biology-09-00484" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Pennyroyal is referenced in 
 <italic>Acharnians</italic>, 
 <italic>Peace</italic>, and 
 <italic>Lysistrata</italic>, three plays by the celebrated dramaturge Aristophanes (c. 450 BC–c. 388 BC). In 
 <italic>Peace</italic>, pennyroyal is suggested to have contraceptive properties [
 <xref rid="B79-biology-09-00484" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>], and in 
 <italic>Acharnians</italic> and 
 <italic>Lysistrata</italic>, the blossoming of pennyroyal is mentioned as a metaphor for pubic hair [

 <xref rid="B82-biology-09-00484" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Trota advised the anointment of pennyroyal oil on a cloth to be placed in the vagina to induce receding of prolapsed uterus caused by traumatic coitus due to the ‘excessive size of the male member’. Pennyroyal also appears in Trota’s work as an herb to be applied in a bath, among several others, which ‘flegmatic and emaciated’ women who could not conceive should take to increase the chances of fertilization. Trota also described several recipes for stimulating menses. In a simple recipe, honey was to be cooked in mint water; mint also appeared in the herb mixture 
 <italic>Tyriaca diathessaron</italic>. A mixture of mint, pennyroyal, rue, red cabbage, leek, and salt would be cooked together in a plain pot, and be drunk in the bath. In addition, she advised the fumigation of cumin, fennel, dill, calamint, mint, and nettle, either individually or mixed. Furthermore, a mixture of ground castoreum, white pepper, costmary, mint, and wild celery in white or sweet wine to be drunk in the evening also appeared. To help women having difficulties to give birth, mint and wormwood powder would also be given, besides mint and other odoriferous herbs being applied to the cervix during the prepartum period. The beverage 
 <italic>Tyriaca magna Galeni</italic>, taken with mint water, was also given to stimulate menses or parturition [

 <xref rid="B83-biology-09-00484" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Centuries later, Hildegard von Bingen wrote in her 
 <italic>Physica</italic> that eating pennyroyal ‘acts to expel the afterbirth’ that remained inside the uterus after delivering the fetus [
 <xref rid="B39-biology-09-00484" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In the 17th century, James Primerose (d. 1659), English physician and notable opponent of William Harvey’s Theory of Circulation, who dedicated a large portion of his career to gynecology and obstetrics, had also mentioned pennyroyal to be an abortifacient [
 <xref rid="B76-biology-09-00484" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Nicholas Culpepper (1616–1654), physician, astrologer, and herbalist warned in his 
 <italic>A Directory for Midwives</italic> ‘give not [pennyroyal] to any that is with Child, lest you turn Murderess’ [
 <xref rid="B84-biology-09-00484" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. The almanacs of two female authors of the 17th century England, Sarah Jinner of London (fl. 1658–1664) and Mary Holden of Sudbury (c. 1648–1726), transmitted classically-based medical cures for women, challenging the existing medical hierarchy [
 <xref rid="B85-biology-09-00484" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Sarah Jinner, a student of astrology and a contemporary of Primerose, wrote the first series of almanacs that focused on female health and destined to transmit updated gynecological knowledge from the medical elite to common literate persons and rural physicians [
 <xref rid="B86-biology-09-00484" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. These almanacs contained herbal useful remedies for managing and treating gynecological disorders, among which a list of ‘pills to expel a dead child’ is included, several containing pennyroyal as an ingredient, which she also noted as being able to regulate menses [
 <xref rid="B87-biology-09-00484" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Thus, pennyroyal became a household herb for inducing abortion and is reported to have been taken with gin during menstruation as recently as the 1950s [
 <xref rid="B88-biology-09-00484" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. The strong effect of pennyroyal is attributed to the oxytocic terpene pulegone, which has, nonetheless, an important hepatotoxic profile [
