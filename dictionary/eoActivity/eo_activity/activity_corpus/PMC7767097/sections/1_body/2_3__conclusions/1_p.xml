<p>This paper makes a thorough descriptive review of the many medical uses given to mints throughout history, from ancient civilizations to modern day medicine, beyond previously published material, highlighting both the authors in medical culture responsible for their dissemination, as well as their major galenic formulations. Most medical knowledge came from Ancient Greek and Roman philosophers and medical authors, while later contributions consisted mainly of progressive technological improvements. From the immediately perceived qualities of these herbs, it can be inferred that the primary intention of their topical application was to probably cause local anesthesia and to control irritation and inflammation, being especially used in gastrointestinal tract affections. Their particular scent and flavor also came of use for the purpose of masking the unpleasant taste of many medicinal formulae long before the advent of pharmaceutical technology. The longevity and diversity of the use of mints in medicine are a testament of their importance, receiving still noble place in herbal medicine.</p>
