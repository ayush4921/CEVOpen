<p>Very high concentrations of flavonoids, at a level approaching ca. 360 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>, were noted for primary brews from mint, which correlates with the highest concentrations of total polyphenols. Analysing the results of flavonoid concentrations in the primary brews, it was observed that in the case of brews from sage, lavender, and fennel, the 10-minute brewing time was optimal for the acquisition of the highest levels of those compounds (120.60 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup> for sage, 60.88 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup> for lavender, and 109.71 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup> for fennel) (

 <sup>−1</sup>. The 30-minute time of primary brewing of mint was optimal in the case of flavonoids, compared to the shorter times (360.81 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>—30 min, 276.33 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>—5 min, 227.83 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>—10 min, and 290.52 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>—15 min). During the brewing of chamomile, the level of flavonoids migrating to the brew was the highest compared to the other herbs—the maximum of the content of those compounds was obtained in the brew prepared during 15 min—403.53 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>, and only a slightly lower concentration, 355.22 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>, was observed for the 30-minute brewing. The concentration of flavonoids in brews from caraway fruits was characterised by low variation, i.e., from 53.04 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup> (10 min) to 73.59 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup> (5 min). Like in the case of total phenolic compounds, the concentrations of flavonoids in the primary brews from the analysed herbs were varied, which is related with the varied content of those substances in the plants, determined by the botanical features. Adaszyńska-Skwirzyńska and Swarcewicz [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] report that the total content of flavonoids in narrow-leaved lavender varies from 86 mg 100 g
 <sup>−1</sup> in the flowers to 618 mg 100 g
 <sup>−1</sup> in the leaves. Taking into account the levels of flavonoids content in lavender inflorescences obtained by the authors cited above, and assuming 100% efficiency of brewing, it is possible to achieve flavonoid concentration in brew from inflorescences and leaves (1/20) in the range from about 43 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup> (inflorescences) to 309 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup> (leaves), which corresponds to the concentration in the primary brew from lavender inflorescences in this study (from 31.82 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup> for 5 min to 60.88 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup> for 10 min).
