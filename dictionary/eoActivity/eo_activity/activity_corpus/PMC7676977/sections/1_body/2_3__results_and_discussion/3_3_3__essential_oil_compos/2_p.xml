 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> presents the percentage contents of the main components of essential oil obtained from the initial plant material and from the postbrewing material (secondary or waste material). The dominant components of lavender oil included linalool, at a share of up to 28.41%, and linalool acetate, with a share of up to 19.03%. Adaszyńska et al. [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] also found that the main component of lavender oil was linalool (8.63–23.88%), and among other components, they enumerate linalyl anthranilate (1.58–12.78%), 
 <italic>α</italic>-terpineol (4.00–7.90%), terpinen-4-ol (5.53–9.73%), lavandulol (3.38–4.64%), geranyl acetate (2.37–10.61%), and caryophyllene oxide (2.12–5.14%). Observing the changes in the contents of the main components of essential oils from the waste raw materials in relation to the prior process of brewing, in some cases one can note certain trends (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In the case of lavender oil, it was observed that the level of linalool acetate decreased from 19.03% (primary material) to 14.88% (secondary material after brewing conducted for 30 min). Lavender oil is characterised by antibacterial, antimycotic, smooth muscle relaxing, sedative, and antidepressant effects and is effective against burns and insect bites and stings. In addition, it is used in aromatherapy and as a flavouring agent for soaps [
