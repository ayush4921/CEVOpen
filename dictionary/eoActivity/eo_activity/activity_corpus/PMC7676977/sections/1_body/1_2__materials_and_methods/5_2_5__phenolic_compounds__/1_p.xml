<p>Determinations of phenolic compounds in the tested macerates were made by spectrophotometric means (
 <italic>λ</italic> = 725 nm) according to a modified Singleton and Rossi method [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The results of the phenols content were expressed in gallic acid equivalents (Sigma-Aldrich, ACS reagent ≥ 98.00%). The results were calculated from the equation of the calibration curve prepared for gallic acid standards in the concentration range 10–60 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup> (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>). Each sample, depending on the material of herbal was diluted appropriately to the range of the standard curve. All analyses were performed in triplicate.
