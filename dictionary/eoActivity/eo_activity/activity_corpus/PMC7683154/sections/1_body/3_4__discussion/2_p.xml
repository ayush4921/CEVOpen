<p>Concerning the sufficient response rate with omeprazole, our study results are closer to those of the studies, as mentioned above. However, although the results of these studies indicate that omeprazole is more effective than other treatments in the treatment of FD, according to the results of our study, the sufficient response rate based on PDS (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and EPS (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) symptoms in herbal medication arm were significantly more than omeprazole arm. Also, the mean reduction in EPS (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), PDS (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), and total GSRS (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) scores after treatment was significantly higher in the intervention group than the control group. The improvement chance of posttreatment based on EPS, PDS, and GSRS scores with the herbal medicine was 27%, 30%, and 27% higher than the omeprazole 20â€‰mg/day, respectively. Patients' quality of life in the intervention group was significantly improved in all scales compared with the control arm at the end of treatment and two weeks after the end of treatment.
