<p>In our study, the superior symptom relief with this herbal medication compared to omeprazole in the treatment of FD may be due to the multiple properties of these essential oils and different mechanisms of FD [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Various pathogeneses such as inflammation, stress, and visceral hypersensitivity have been described for sensory, motor, and secretory impairment of the GI tract in FD and other FGIDs symptoms [

 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. While about the essential oils and monoterpenes of ZM, TA, and AG, various studies indicated the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties [

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and the ability to inhibit neurogenic and inflammatory pains [

 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>–
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Also, prokinetic medications such as serotonergic agonists have beneficial effects on FD symptoms [

 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Monoterpenes in these essential oils such as thymol, carvacrol, (+)-carvone, and limonene are potent agonists of the transient receptor potential ankyrin-1 (TRPA1) channel [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. TRPA1 agonists are known as prokinetic compounds [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] because of their ability to stimulate the production of 5-HT [
