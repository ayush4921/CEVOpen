<p>The present research aimed to compare the efficacy of a novel herbal medication consisting of ZM, AG, and TA essential oils with omeprazole to improve the GI symptoms of patients with FD. According to the results, the improvement of EPS, PDS, total GSRS, GSRS Dyspepsia, and GSRS Pain scores compared to baseline in inner group comparison in both omeprazole and herbal medication groups were statistically significant (

After two weeks of treatment, the sufficient response rate based on PDS and EPS scores ≤3 was 78.3% and 73.7% in the intervention group and 36.4% and 40.9% in the control group. Regarding the efficacy of PPI in the treatment of FD, based on the results of a meta-analysis of six randomized controlled trials, PPI therapy is significantly more effective than placebo or antacid treatment [

Although the results of another study showed no significant difference between omeprazole and ranitidine groups, however, in this study, after four weeks of treatment, sufficient symptom relief was significantly more for those receiving omeprazole 20 mg/day (51%) compared with cisapride (31%) and placebo (23%) [
