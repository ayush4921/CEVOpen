<p>Firstly, the gastroenterologist visited the patients, and the inclusion criteria were confirmed; then, participants were justified briefly about the research, and informed consent was obtained. They were then randomly divided into two equal groups of control and intervention, which received medical regimens A and B, respectively. Randomization was done by using a random allocation software-generated list and in a 1 : 1 ratio. Also, the randomization and medicine administration was done by someone other than the investigators. The medicines were put in similar cans, and the code of the medicinal regimen was labeled on each can. The code of medicine given to each patient and their clinical symptoms was recorded on the treatment of the evaluator's personal information form (a trained medical student). The investigators, patients, and treatment assessors were not aware of the medicine regimens type. Regimen A was 20 mg omeprazole capsule once a day for two weeks, and regimen B was 250 mg soft-gel capsules containing pure essential oils of ZM (28.8%), AG (21.6%), and TA (21.6%), and sunflower oil (28%) as an excipient twice a day for two weeks. Also, for blinding the participants, aromatized sunflower oil soft-gel capsules twice a day and starch hard gel capsules once a day in the same shape, size, and color as placebo were given to control and intervention arms, respectively.</p>
