 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. GSRS has been approved in other studies with five dimensions, including abdominal pain (stomachache, hunger pain, and nausea), reflux (heartburn and regurgitation), diarrhea (diarrhea, loose stools, and the urgent need for defecation), constipation (constipation, hard stool, and feeling of incomplete evacuation), and dyspepsia (borborygmus, abdominal distention, eructation, and increased flatus). The total score of symptoms is obtained by summing the mean scores of the subscales. Previous studies have shown that GSRS has a high level of internal consistency [
