Treatment was discontinued if severe adverse events occurred. In order to evaluate the safety, the laboratory tests (serum alanine aminotransferases and aspartate aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, total and direct bilirubin, random blood sugar, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine) were performed at the start and after treatment. Patients were asked to keep their medication until the end of the study.
