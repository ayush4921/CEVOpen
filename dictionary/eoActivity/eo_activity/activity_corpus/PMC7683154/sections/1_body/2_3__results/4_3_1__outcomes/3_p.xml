<p>The improvement of EPS, PDS, total GSRS, GSRS Dyspepsia, and GSRS Pain scores compared to baseline in inner group comparison using paired sample 
 <italic>t</italic>-test in both omeprazole and herbal medication groups were statistically significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). However, the mean score of EPS and PDS at the end and two weeks after the trial's end were significantly lower in the intervention group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Also, the mean reduction scores in EPS and PDS after the trial's end were significantly higher in the intervention arm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The mean increase in these symptoms two weeks after the trial's end was lower in the intervention arm, but these differences were not statistically significant (
