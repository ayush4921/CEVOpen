<p>During the intervention, four patients were excluded from the study, because no efficacy assessment was performed after the initiation of treatment; one from the control group and three of the intervention group due to lack of cooperation. Lack of cooperation was considered as not completing the daily checklist of symptoms severity or not visiting after treatment. Thus, the statistical analysis of efficacy based on the ITT principle was performed with 60 patients (29 in the intervention group and 31 in the control group). Also, one patient of the intervention group and two patients in the control arm did not return for reassessment after the first assessment. In these cases, missing values were substituted by the mean imputation method. As a result, 89% of patients (28 in the intervention group and 29 in the control group) finished the study.</p>
