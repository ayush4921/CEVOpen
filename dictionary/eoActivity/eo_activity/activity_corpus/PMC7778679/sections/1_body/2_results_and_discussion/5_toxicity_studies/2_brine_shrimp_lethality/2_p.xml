 <xref rid="cit0030">30</xref> (2001) used the 
 <italic>A. salina</italic> model to determine the toxicity of 20 plant extracts. The authors found a good correlation between in vivo and in vitro tests, concluding that brine shrimp lethality studies are a useful alternative to predict the acute oral toxicity of plant extracts. Moreover, the 
 <italic>A. salina</italic> model is a useful tool for toxicity studies, due to the benefits of the method, which include quickness, cost-effectiveness, and reproducibility.
