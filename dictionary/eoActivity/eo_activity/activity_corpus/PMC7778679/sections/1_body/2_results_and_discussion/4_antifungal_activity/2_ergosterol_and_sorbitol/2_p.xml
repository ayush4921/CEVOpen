<p>A previous study investigated the mode of action of 
 <italic>Thyme vulgaris</italic> EO, against 
 <italic>Rhizopus oryzae</italic>, via interaction with ergosterol, and verified that this EO can interact with the fungal membrane, as evidenced by increasing MIC values in the presence of ergosterol.
 <xref rid="cit0067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref> Another study demonstrated that 
 <italic>Laurus nobilis</italic> EO may interfere have two mechanisms of action against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, (cell wall biosynthesis and ionic permeability of the fungal cell membrane), considering that increased MIC values for this EO are observed in the presence of ergosterol and sorbitol.
