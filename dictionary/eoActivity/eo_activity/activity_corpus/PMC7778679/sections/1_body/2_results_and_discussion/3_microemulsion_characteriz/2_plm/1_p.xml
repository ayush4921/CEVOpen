<p>The ME and ME+EO were analyzed by PLM to evaluate the structure of the formulations. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2</xref> shows the PLM photomicrographs of the ME (A) and ME+EO (B). Photomicrography A (10% oil phase) showed isotropic behavior (dark field), which, in the plane of polarized light, did not deviate light, suggesting the formation of a microemulsified system. Photomicrography B (10% oil phase), after the incorporation of the EO in the ME, also showed a dark field and therefore, the lipid system containing the active ingredient maintains the characteristics of a microemulsified system.
