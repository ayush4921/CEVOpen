 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0006">Figure 6</xref> shows TEM images of the ME and ME+EO at a magnification of 50,000Ã—. The photomicrographs of the ME and ME+EO showed spherical structures; however, ME+EO images showed possible EO droplets inside the spherical structures, which suggested incorporation of the EO.
 <xref rid="cit0055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> The particle sizes of the formulations obtained from DLS measurements were confirmed by TEM photomicrographs, which showed particles ranging from 50 to 200 nm.
