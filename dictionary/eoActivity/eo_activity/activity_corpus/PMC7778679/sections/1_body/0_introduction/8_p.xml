<p>In this context, the aim of this study was to evaluate the possible improvement of the anti-
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> activity of the EO of 
 <italic>C. nardus</italic> when loaded in a microemulsion (ME+EO). The mode of action was assessed by analyzing sorbitol and ergosterol interaction. The human cell line, HaCat, and an alternative model of 
 <italic>Artemia salina</italic> were used to evaluate toxicity. Furthermore, in vivo VVC treatment was assessed in mice, in order to investigate the efficacy of vaginal administration of EO and ME+EO for the control of vaginal fungal infection.
