<p>Zeta potential (ZP) was determined by assessing electrophoretic mobility using a Zetasizer Nano NS instrument (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK). Analyses were performed 24 h after ME preparation. The samples were diluted 1:10 in ultra-purified water, placed in the electrophoretic cell, and 3 determinations of surface potential were performed for each sample (ME and ME+EO). The mean and standard deviation were calculated. Zeta potential analyses were carried out after 24 h (T0) and 3 months (T3) of samples preparation in order to verify stability of formulations.</p>
