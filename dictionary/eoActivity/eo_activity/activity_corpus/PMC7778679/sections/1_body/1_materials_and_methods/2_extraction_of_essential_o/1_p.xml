<p>EO was extracted from fresh leaves of 
 <italic>C. nardus</italic> (150 g) by hydrodistillation, using a Clevenger-type apparatus attached to a round bottom flask (3 L) with 1500 mL of deionized water (4 h). Residual water in the EO was separated from the sample by freezing. The yield of the EO was 0.7% (w/w). EO samples were stored at −20ºC until used for chemical analysis and biological assays.
