<p>The plant is a member of the Anacardiaceae family, which includes tropical representatives like mango (
 <italic>Mangifera indica</italic>) and cashew (
 <italic>Anacardium occidentale</italic>), but also species vegetating under temperate climates, for example the allergenic poison sumac (
 <italic>Rhus toxicodendron</italic>). 
 <italic>C. coggygria</italic> is multi-stemmed, deciduous, averaging heights of 5–7 m. Its leaves have an ovate or obovate shape, pinnate venation and a glaucous lower face. The small flowers are grouped in large panicles, with the pedicels elongating into hairy stalks that cover the inflorescences with smoke-like puffs. This “smoked” aspect inspired several names of the plant: “smoketree”, “smoke bush”, and even “wig tree”. The species is one of the seven of the genus 
 <italic>Cotinus</italic> Mill., the others having a narrower distribution range, in North America: 
 <italic>C. obovatus</italic> (native to Central and South East of the United States), 
 <italic>C. carranzae</italic> and 
 <italic>C. chiangii</italic> (both native to Mexico), and in Asia: 
 <italic>C. kanaka</italic> (native to the southern part of the Eastern Himalayas), 
 <italic>C. nanus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. szechuanensis</italic> (growing in South-Central China)
