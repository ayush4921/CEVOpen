<p>The knowledge of the therapeutic qualities that has been passed on from generation to generation has lead to a reservoir of information that became the subject of modern research aimed at validating these effects through 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments. Interestingly, a closely related species, previously classified in the same genus as the European smoketree, 
 <italic>Rhus</italic>, shares a significant amount of common constituents. This species, called Asian lacquer (
 <italic>Toxicodendron vernicifluum</italic> or 
 <italic>Rhus verniciflua</italic>) proved to have many similar indications, but also new ones. By integrating the phytochemistry and pharmacology of these two species, the current review intends to advance and expand the practical use of the European species which has the advantage of being free of allergenic urushiols, as opposed to its Asian counterpart (
