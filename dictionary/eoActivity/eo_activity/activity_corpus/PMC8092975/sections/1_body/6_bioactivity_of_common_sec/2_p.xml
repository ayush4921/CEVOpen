<p>Fisetin benefited from a special attention in recent research (

 <xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr">Yan et al., 2021</xref>). This flavonol is also present in many edible plants such as strawberries, onions, apples or persimmons. The fisetin content in plants is between 2 and 160 μg/g (

 <italic>Rhus cotinus</italic> and studies conducted over time showed anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antioxidant and neuroprotective effects (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Grynkiewicz and Demchuk, 2019</xref>). Of particular interest is ability of fisetin to reduce senescence markers in mice and human tissues. A reduction of senescent cells fraction in white adipose tissue of naturally aged C57BL/6 mice after fisetin treatment was reported (

Evaluation of fisetin effects in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis revealed an inhibition of alveolar epithelium cell senescence through regulation of AMPK/NF-κB signaling pathway. The anti-fibrotic activity of fisetin was therefore associated with the senolytic properties of this compound (
