<p>Eriodictyol is known for anti-inflammatory, cardioprotective, neuroprotective, anti-obesity, antioxidant and anti-cancer (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Islam et al., 2020</xref>) effects. This flavanone induces apoptosis of CHG-5 and U87MG glioma cell lines, thus presenting anti-tumor effects. The mechanism involved is related to the downregulation of PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway (

Eriodictyol (20 mg/kg or 40 mg/kg) was administered orally in rats with collagen-induced rheumatoid arthritis for four weeks and it determined a reduction of paw swelling and decreased IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α levels (

Eriodictyol showed positive effects on dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, inflammation and hepatic steatosis when administered in diet induced C57BL/6N obese mice. A decrease in triglyceride, total cholesterol and free fatty acids levels was observed after dietary supplementation with 0.005% w/w eriodictyol for 16 weeks. Plasma glucose and plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were also reduced (
