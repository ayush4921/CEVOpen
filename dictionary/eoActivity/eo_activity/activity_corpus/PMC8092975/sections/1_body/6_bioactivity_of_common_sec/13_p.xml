<p>The health-promoting effects of smoketree extracts are further supported by pharmacological data other secondary metabolites, including fustin, eriodictyol, isoliquiritigenin, taxifolin, myricetin and pentagalloyl-glucose. Fustin (dihydrofisetin), a major flavanonol derivative in heartwoods of 
 <italic>C. coggygria</italic> and 
 <italic>T. vernicifluum</italic>, has antioxidative, antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory effects (

 <italic>T. vernicifluum</italic> branches standardized in 3% of this compound were tested in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated rats and were able to prevent the elevation of interleukin-6 cytokine, as well as the expression of iNOS, and COX-2 mRNA expression (
