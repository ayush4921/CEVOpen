<p>Fisetin has also been studied as an anti-diabetic. In an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> model of experimental diabetes, oral administration of fisetin (10Â mg/kg) reduced blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels, while the plasma insulin level was increased. This flavonoid also lead to a decrease of mRNA and expression levels of gluconeogenic genes (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, glucose-6-phosphatase) (
