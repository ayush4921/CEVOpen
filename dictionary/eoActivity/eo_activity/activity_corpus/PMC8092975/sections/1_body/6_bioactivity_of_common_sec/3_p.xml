<p>Fisetin exerts an antiatherosclerotic effect in mice by reducing the lipid and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and increasing the level of superoxide dismutase (SOD). The reduction of the atherosclerotic plaque was observed. Fisetin also regulates the expression of LOX-1 (lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1) and PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) thus improving lipid metabolism (

Patients receiving 100Â mg fisetin daily for seven days exhibited lower levels of C-reactive protein, MMP-2 (matrix metalloproteinase-2) and MMP-9 (matrix metalloproteinase-9). Therefore, fisetin has shown potential for use as a supplement in reperfusion therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (

Fisetin reduced apoptosis in myocardial cells, prolonged coagulation and decreased Von Willebrand factor plasma levels (
