<p>The anticancer effect of fisetin has also been studied, and the mechanisms by which it acts in cancer have been highlighted in several studies. Its effects have been evaluated in prostate cancer, colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer or breast cancer cell lines (

 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Jia et al., 2019</xref>). It has been proposed as an adjuvant to 5-fluorouracil treatment in PIK3CA-mutant colorectal cancer. The association of 5-fluorouracil and fisetin resulted in a marked decrease in the viability of cancer cells. The combination determined inhibition of AKT phosphorylation and decreased PI3K (phosphatidylinositide-3-kinase) expression. A preventive effect against tumor formation was also observed for fisetin (

Administration of 100Â mg fisetin per day for seven weeks, before and during chemotherapy, resulted in a decrease of hs-CRP (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein) and IL-8 (interleukin-8) levels in the intervention group, revealing the anti-inflammatory activity of this compound when used as a complementary treatment in colorectal cancer (
