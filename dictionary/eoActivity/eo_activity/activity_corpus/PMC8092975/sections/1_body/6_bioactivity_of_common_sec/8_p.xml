<p>Sulfuretin is a major compoud of smoketree wood, emblematic for its golden color. Among the reported effects for this compound are the anti-inflammatory, anticancer, neuroprotective and antidiabetic ones (

 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Choi et al., 2003</xref>). The research of the mechanism of the anti-inflammatory pointed to an induction of heme oxygenase-1 expression (
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2010</xref>), inhibition of LPS-induced inducible nitric oxide synthase, inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2, and reduction of the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines via down-regulation of NF-kappaB (

 <italic>In vivo.</italic> sulfuretin maintained joint integrity, a result underscored by radiologic and histopathologic evidence (
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). As a potential anti-diabetic, sulfuretin inhibits aldose reductase, diminishes formation of glycation end products (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2008</xref>), and protects against cytokine-induced beta-cell damage in experimentally induced diabetes (
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2010</xref>). The anti-obesity effect of sulfuretin was emphasized in a study performed on obese mice. Decrease of total cholesterol and triglycerides levels, inhibition of lipid accumulation, as well as improvement of glucose metabolism were observed. Sulfuretin also prevented body weight gain (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2019</xref>). The anti-adipogenic activity has been associated with the properties of sulfuretin to supress adipogenic factors such as PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ), C/EBPα (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α) and C/EBPβ. Sulfuretin exhibited dose and time dependent proliferation-reducing effects of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes cells (
