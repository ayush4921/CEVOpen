<p>Given the association of neurodegenerative diseases with alterations in gut microbiota, the effects of fisetin as neuroprotective agent have been studied in a mice model of Parkinsonâ€™s disease.

It also increased the abundance of Lachnospiraceae, activity associated with its neuroprotective properties (
