<p>Pentagalloyl glucose is a hydrolysable tannin with a high antioxidant activity due to the numerous phenolic hydroxy groups in its structure. Its properties include anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, antidiabetic, and anti-cancer properties. It is able to inhibit DNA replication, cause cell cyle arrest in the G1 and S phases, and elicit apoptosis (
 <xref rid="B139" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). This compound stands out due to its ability to bond to proteins, especially those with a high-proline content like collagens, via hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic forces. This property makes pentagalloylglucose a candidate in the treatment of vascular disease (
