<p>Recently, 
 <italic>C. coggygria</italic> extracts have been studied with regard to their potential in skin care, evaluating the effects as inhibitors of collagenase and elastase, fundamental components of the connective tissue which are responsible for the resistance and elasticity of the skin. The research also tested tyrosinase inhibitory effect, in order to identify a potential utilization as skin lightener. Departing from ethanol extracts of pedicels and leaves, an activity-guided fractionation was performed in order to point out the most active compounds. After partition, it was the ethyl-acetate soluble fraction of the pedicels that had the best effect on collagenase inhibition accompanied by a moderate inhibition of elastase and tyrosinase. The main components of the active fractions were methyl gallate, astragalin, isoquercetin, and hyperoside (
