<p>There are some reports of 
 <italic>C. coggygria</italic> form Turkish ethnomedicine, that describe its utilization in diabetes (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Kültür, 2007</xref>). Some basic steps were performend until now to verify this indication, with regard to the inhibition of key enzymed involved in the disease. A methanol extract and its fractions (petroleum ether, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol) obtained from leaves smoketree were evaluated 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> with regard to their α-glucosidase and α-amylase inhibitory activities. The ethyl acetate-soluble fraction displayed the highest efficacy (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.0082 mg/ml), having an inhibitory activity roughly ten times higher than the other fractions. Alfa-amylase was not inhibited in that experimental setting (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Gözcü et al., 2016</xref>). The α-glucosidase inhibitory activity was also reported for the ethanol extract prepared from the branches of the shrub. After bioactivity-guided fractionation, 2,3,4,6-penta-
 <italic>O</italic>-galloyl-β-D-glucose was shown to have the best α-glucosidase inhibitory effect, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.96 mg/ml. Comparatively, the related compoung with only four gallic acid residues 1,2,3,6-tetra-O-galloyl-β-D-glucose and gallic acid had week inhibitory effects (
