<p>The anti-cancer effects of 
 <italic>C. coggygria</italic> have received the highest attention in the last period, since the last review on smoketree. References to this regard exist in traditional medicine (

 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">Redžić, 2007</xref>). Some works explored the cytotoxic effect of smoketree extracts and metabolites on different cell lines, while others pointed out protective effects via antioxidant and anti-mutagenic activities (

One of the earliest studies investigating the cytotoxic effects of this plant focused on the methanol extracts from leaves and flowers, rich in gallic acid and its derivatives. The extracts were applied on two human carcinoma cell lines (cervix–HeLa and colon–LS174). The leaf extract was more active on the HeLa cell line (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 19.1 ± 3.9% μg/mL), while the flower extract had a slightly better inhibition of the LS174 cell line (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 41.3 ± 3.9 μg/ml) (
