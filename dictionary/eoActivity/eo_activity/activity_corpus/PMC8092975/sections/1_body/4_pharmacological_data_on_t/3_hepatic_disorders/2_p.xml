 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">Pavlov et al. (2013b)</xref> investigated the toxicity of the aqueous infusion prepared from leaves (1, 2, 4%), administered intragastrically for 30 days in a concentration of 10Â ml/kg. The authors did not detect pathological modifications in the organs of the treated rats, no subchronic hepatic or renal toxicity were noted. Moreover, no changes in the activity of hepatic enzymes and levels of urea, creatinine, total thyols and triacylglycerols were found.
