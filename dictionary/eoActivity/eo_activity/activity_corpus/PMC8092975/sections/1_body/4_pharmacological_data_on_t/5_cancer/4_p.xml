<p>The cytotoxic effects of the diethyl ether-soluble fraction obtained from smoketree heartwood were assessed before and after complexation with two cyclodextrins. Along with the extract, two of its marker compounds (the aurone sulfuretin and the chalcone butein) were as well studied. Among the four cell lines that were used in the work (HeLa, A2780, MCF7, and MDA-MB-231), the most sensitive against 
 <italic>C. coggygria</italic> extract was ovarian carcinoma cell line A2780. The proliferation of these cells were inhibited in the low micromolar range. Butein had the highest activity against HeLa cells, both included in randomly methylated-Î²-cyclodextrin and in uncomplexed form. Sulfuretin and its complexes had a generally weaker cytotoxicity (
