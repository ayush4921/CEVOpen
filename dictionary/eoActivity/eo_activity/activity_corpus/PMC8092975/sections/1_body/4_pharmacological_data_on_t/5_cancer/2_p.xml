<p>Gospodinova and co-workers investigated the effects of an aqueous ethanolic extract from smoketree leaves, standardized in total polyphenols and flavonoids (2017 a,b,c). The cytotoxicity tests involving human breast cancer cells (MCF7) showed a significant cytotoxic activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 40.6 μg/ml) which was not dose-dependent (

In a second study, the inhibitory effects on three additional cell lines (breast cancer T47D, cervical cancer HeLa, and ovarian cancer A2780) were explored, in comparison a non-cancerous cell line (breast epithelial cell line MCF10A). Ovarian cancer cells were the most sensitive, being inhibited at an IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 30.8 μg/ml; a certain degree of selectivity against cancer cells were noted in comparison with normal cells (

The research of a possible mechanism of action lead to the investigation of histone deacetylase activity in MCF7 cells following the application of the leaf extract; high levels of histone deacetylase activity is characteristic for cancer cells. The authors reported a significant reduction of HDAC5 and HDAC7 mRNA transcripts at 2 days post-treatment. A tendency to reduce HDAC3 transcriptional levels also resulted from the research (

The last paper of this work-group focused on the cytotoxic effects against A431 cells (human squamous cell carcinoma), in comparison with normal skin cells (BJ line). The selectivity against cancer cells was observed, and the best anticancer activity was achieved by the chloroformic fraction of the extract, in comparison to that of the aqueous fraction (

Another extract obtained from leaves with ethyl acetate as solvent was applied on normal skin cells (BJ) and mammary gland epithelium cells (MCF-10A). The extract inhibited the proliferation of activated human fibroblasts expressing fibroblast activation protein α (FAP). This is a serine protease implicated in the genesis and progression of tumors (

 <italic>C. coggygria</italic> branches and leaves showed significant cytotoxic effects, and both cell morphology and growth were affected. The effects on the cell cycle were consistent in all cell lines (A549, MCF7, TK6 and U937), irrespective of their phenotype (adherent or in suspension). The expression profiles of distinct proteins controlling the progression of the cell cycle and cell death were altered. The percentage of cells in the G1 phase was induced by the extract (
