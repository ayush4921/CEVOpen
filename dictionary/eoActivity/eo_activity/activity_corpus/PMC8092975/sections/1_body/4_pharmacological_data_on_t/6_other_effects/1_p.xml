<p>As for many other medicinal plants, in addition to the validation of effects known from traditional medicine, modern research aims to expand the uses of this species. In this regard, a potential field is represented by neurological disorders. Eftimov and co-workers explored the effects of an aqueous infusion from leaves (1, 2 and 4%, 10Â ml/kg) on the behavior of rats, and its protective effect against lipid peroxidation (

In the forced swim test, the timespan of immobility increased, and the effect was significant for the 2% infusion. The infusion had no sedative effect, did not induce motor dis-coordination, but reduced signs of depression. The decrease in malondialdehyde levels was not significant and the authors concluded that the positive effects on brain function were not related to an antioxidative effect (
