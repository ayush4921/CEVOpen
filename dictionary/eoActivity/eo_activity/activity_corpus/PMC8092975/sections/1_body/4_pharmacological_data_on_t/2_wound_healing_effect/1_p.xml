<p>In virtually all countries where smoketree is used in traditional phytotherapy, the wound-healing effect is the most cited one. In order to validate this effect (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Aksoy et al., 2016</xref>), employed a model of excision wounds in rats with experimentally induced diabetes. The topical application of an ointment containing 5% ethanol extract from leaves demonstrated a significant wound healing effect, confirmed histologically. The elevation of hydroxyproline levels, a precursor of collagen, together with favorable antioxidative effects (elevation in glutathione and decrease in malondialdehyde levels) supported the favorable effect of the extract on wound healing. The wound healing effect is also supported by the antimicrobial effect of

In order to seek scientific validation for the use of smoketree in the treatment of gastritis, Pavlov and co-workers evaluated the benefits of an aqueous infusion from leaves in indomethacin-induced damage of the gastric mucosa. The intra-gastric administration of 10 ml 2% infusion reduced the number and area of ulcerations, as well as their depth and severity. This effect was accompanied by the decrease of malondialdehyde and uric acid levels, reducing as well the activity of alkaline phosphatase (
