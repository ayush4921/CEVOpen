<p>Acetylcholine esterase inhibition is a major target for drugs combating neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. A screening of various plant extracts with Ellman’s reagent pointed to 
 <italic>C. coggygria</italic> as having a real potential to inhibit this enzyme. The best activity was achieved by the crude methanol extract of the heartwood (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 89.3 μg/ml). In order to find the most active compounds, this extract was partitioned in solvents of increasing polarities (petroleum ether, diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, n-butanol, and water), with the diethyl ether fraction having the highest efficacy (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 25.4 μg/ml) due to its content in sulfuretin (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 29.9 μM). After intracerebral injection, the extract elicited an increased acetlycoline concentration (
