<p>The cytotoxic effect of 
 <italic>C. coggygria</italic> on gliobastoma cells (lines U87, U251, and DBTRG-05MG) were investigated by (

The authors evaluated an ethanol (95%) extract from roots and stems, which contained 4% flavonoids: rutin, fisetin, quercetin, and myricetin. These flavonoids were also used as controls in the assays. The extract was able to inhibit the proliferation of the three cell lines (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 128.49 μg/ml for U87, 107.62 μg/ml for U251, and 93.57 μg/ml for DBTRG-05MG). It induced apoptosis via Akt inhibition, coupled with ERK protein expression. Moreover, the researchers evaluated the significance of their findings in a xenograft model glioblastoma multiforme in female BALB/c mice, reporting a significant antitumor effect. The reduction of the tumor volume after administration of 25 and 50 mg/kg extract (evaluated at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days) was in the same range as in case of the positive control, temozolomide (

In a subsequent study, the same extract was loaded into polyvinylpyrrolidone K-30/sodium dodecyl sulfate and polyethyleneglycol-coated liposome, in order to augment its solubility and to achieve an improved cerebral targeting. The cytotoxic mechanism of action of this preparation was studied 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. A DBTRG-05MG glioblastoma cell line was employed. Results pointed to a caspase-dependent activation of both the intrinsic and extrinsic signaling pathways of apoptosis. The proposed mechanism of the proapoptotic effect in glioblastoma cells involved the blockade of the SIRT1/p53-mediated mitochondrial pathway and of the Akt pathway (

 <italic>C. coggygria</italic> had, was confirmed by an additional work. This study was also performed on a second extract (total flavonoids isolated from 
 <italic>C. coggygria</italic> var. 
 <italic>cinerea</italic>). Both extracts reduced cell proliferation and downregulated the signaling pathways PI3K/Akt and ERK (
