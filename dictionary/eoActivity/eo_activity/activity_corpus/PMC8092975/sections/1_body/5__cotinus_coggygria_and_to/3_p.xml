<p>The high number of shared compounds points to possible similarities in the pharmacology of both species. Moreover, it may provide a significant support in advancing the practical use of the European species into other fields of therapeutic significance, which have already been well developed for 
 <italic>T. vernicifluum</italic>. To this date, the pharmacologic activities that have been reported for this species are: anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-cancer, anti-microbial, anti-diabetic, anti-dislipidemic, anti-platlet, anti-vasoconstrictor, as well as protective of the liver, kidneys, neurons and gastro-intestinal tract. The numerous

 <italic>in vivo</italic> highlighting these effects make the object of a well-documented review by (

 <italic>T. vernicifluum</italic>, is represented by missing or incomplete data on the plant part, the extraction solvent(s) and key marker compounds. Representative studies investigating lacquer extracts standardized in compounds that occur in both species are listed in

 <italic>C. coggygria</italic> over 
 <italic>T. vernicifluum</italic> is the absence of allergenic urushiols (
