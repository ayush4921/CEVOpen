<p>Despite the research performed up to the present on 
 <italic>C. coggygria</italic>, mandatory data are yet missing in the pharmacology of this species, including pharmacokinetic tests and clinical trials. Interestingly, as these data are lacking for extracts and fractions, they exist for some of the main compounds of smoketree heartwood: sulfuretin, fisetin, butein, owing mostly to the presence of these and other compounds in the Chinese lacquer (
 <italic>Toxicodendron vernicifluum</italic>, syn. 
 <italic>Rhus verniciflua</italic>). In fact, 
 <italic>T. vernicifluum</italic> is has a firmly established position in traditional Asian medicine. Not only have there been performed comprehensive 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies on this species, but clinical data are also available (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). Most of these studies used extracts standardized in fustin (&gt;13.0%), fisetin (7.0%), sulfuretin, butein and other compounds (

 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2011</xref>). The pharmacokinetic profile of several active compounds has also been reported (
