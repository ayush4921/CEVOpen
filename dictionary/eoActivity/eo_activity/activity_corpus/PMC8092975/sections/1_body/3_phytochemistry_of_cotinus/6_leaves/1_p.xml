<p>As leaves were mainly considered a source of tannins, reports on the structure of leaf flavonoids are scarce. Early studies showed that these compounds are based on three main aglycons: myricetin, quercetin, and kaempferol. Sugars of flavonoid glycosides are bound in position 3 of the aglycon and are represented by D-glucose, L-rhamnose, and L-arabinose. Glycosides of the myricetin group (75–80%) are dominant over those of the quercetin group (18–23%), while kampferol glycosides are present in traces (

They include delphinidin 3-galactoside and 7-glucoside, cyanidin 3-galactoside (idaein) and 3-glucoside-7-rhamnoside as well as petunidin 3-glucoside (
