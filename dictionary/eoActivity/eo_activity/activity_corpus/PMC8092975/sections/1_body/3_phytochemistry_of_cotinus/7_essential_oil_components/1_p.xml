<p>The volatile organic compounds from 
 <italic>C. coggygria</italic> have thoroughly been investigated in plants from a variety of regions, ranging from Western Europe to the Himalayas. Due to its aromatic scent, the essential oil of the plant is used in perfumery. Bulgaria is one of the countries producing essential oil form leaves and young twigs of smoketree (
