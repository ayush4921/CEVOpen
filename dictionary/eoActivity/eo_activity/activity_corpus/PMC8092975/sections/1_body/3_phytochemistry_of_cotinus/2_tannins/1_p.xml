 <italic>C. coggygria</italic>, a fact that relates to its taxonomic affiliation to the Anacardiaceae family–a group with economically important tanning plants like quebracho (
 <italic>Schinopsis</italic> spp.) and sumacs (
 <italic>Rhus</italic> spp.). These polyphenols are able to establish bonds with proteins, and precipitate them–a property which is at the heart of their bioactivity. Their interaction with dermal collagen fibers explains their cicatrizing effects, while the precipitation of bacterial proteins by tannins correlates with their antibacterial effect (

 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">Šavikin et al., 2009</xref>). The most extensive data on the chemical structure of leaf tannins were reported by Rendeková and co-workers; identifications were performed upon comparison of UV and mass spectra with those from the literature or authentic standards. The presence of galloyl glucose (glucogallin), protocatechuic acid hexoside, trigalloyl hexoside, and tetragalloyl hexoside is accordingly added to the previously known hydrolysable tannins (
