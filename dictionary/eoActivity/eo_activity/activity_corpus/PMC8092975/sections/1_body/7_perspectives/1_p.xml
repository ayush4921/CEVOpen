 <italic>Cotinus coggygria</italic> Scop. is a species brought in to the attention of modern pharmacological research via centuries-old traditional medicine. It is not included in European Pharmacopoeas. Most of the effects mentioned in ethnopharmacy found support after scrutiny with 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experimental models: wound-healing, anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory. The chemical composition of the plant includes three major groups of compoundsâ€“tannins, volatile organic compounds and flavonoids. With regard to the latter, smoketree showcases a distinctive profile of 5-deoxyflavonoids consisting in notable amounts of sulfuretin, fisetin and butein. Interestingly, this rare profile is shared by the lacquer tree (
 <italic>Toxicodendron vernicifluum</italic>), a species of Asian origin that is taxonomically related to smoketree. While biomedical research performed on this well-established species in Asian phytotherapy is superposing with some known health-promoting activities of the smoketree, it has a real potential to guide research and utilization toward new therapies. These chiefly include obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, vascular disease and cancer treatment.
