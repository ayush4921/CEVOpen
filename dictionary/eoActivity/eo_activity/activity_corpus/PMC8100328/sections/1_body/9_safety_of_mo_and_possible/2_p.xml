<p>It is familiar that patients tend to use herbal products in the purpose of healing and curing considering it completely safe regardless of pharmacotherapy they are assigned to. As MO is most commonly used as a mild sedative because of its calming effects, to date, the only described interactions of MO refer to synergism with sedatives and barbiturates and inhibition of SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) (

MO exerts its therapeutic properties via inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity and GABA transaminase, so it potentiates the effects of drugs acting in the same way. Thus, the usage of MO OTC preparations should be careful and monitored or advised by a pharmacist in patients using these drugs. This is because there is a possibility that MO potentiates the depressing effect on the central nervous system. Theoretically, MO may also interact with thyroid hormone therapy in the conditions of hypothyroidism, because of its ability to inhibit the thyroid hormone receptors (

Identification of MO interactions with cardiovascular drugs is of great significance as few years ago, a descriptive study employing cardiopathy patients on anticoagulation therapy, well known to be prone to dangerous drug and/or herb interactions, reported that high percentage of these patients self-used herbal medications, with MO being on the third place by frequency (

Interestingly, it was recently reported that the most abundant component of MO, RA, may weakly inhibit the two isoforms of cytochrome P450 oxidase, CYP2C19, and CYP2E1 and moderately competitively inhibit UGT1A1, UGT1A6, and UGT2B7 (

Another component of MO, flavonoid quercetin, was proven to interact with digoxin in terms of raising its bioavailability, which may result in the potentially harmful effect of this drug, well known to possess narrow therapeutic index (
