<p>There are a vast number of studies claiming that triterpene compounds of MO ursolic and oleanolic acid are 
 <italic>per se</italic> cardioprotective. For example, ursolic acid exerts cardioprotection in different ways. First, it was shown that ursolic acid possesses negative inotropic and dromotropic effect, thus inducing antiarrhythmic effect in rats (

 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Mu et al., 2019</xref>) via several mechanisms: antiapoptotic effect on cardiomyocytes, anti-inflammatory effect, antioxidant effect through suppression of ROS formation, and enhancement of antioxidant protection [SOD, catalase (CAT), GSH] (

There is also evidence that oleanolic acid could improve the release of NO from the endothelium and induce vasorelaxation, which is mediated by phosphoinositide-3-kinaseâ€“dependent phosphorylation of Akt-Ser473 followed by phosphorylation of eNOS-Ser1177 (
