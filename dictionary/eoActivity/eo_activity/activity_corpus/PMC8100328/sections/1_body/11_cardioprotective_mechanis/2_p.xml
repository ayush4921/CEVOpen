<p>Besides thoroughly described phenolic acid most abundant in MO-RA, additional phenolic acids such as gallic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, etc., may also contribute to cardioprotection induced by MO through several mechanisms. Gallic acid applied in a dose of 20 mg/kg was proven to reduce cardiac remodeling and hypertrophy via activation of autophagy, which subsequently causes the degradation of epidermal growth factor receptor, gp130, and CaNA and finally leads to the inactivation of their downstream pathways (ERK1/2, AKT, JAK2, STAT3, and NFATc1) (

Ferulic acid application (20 and 40 mg/kg) was shown to protect the heart against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity as proven by the decrease of natriuretic peptides atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide, cardiac enzymes CK-MB and lactate dehydrogenase, decrease of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-6, and increase of antioxidant GSH in the myocardium. It is suggested that ferulic acid acts as an antihypertensive because of the existing evidence about its ability to decrease systolic blood pressure, left ventricular diastolic stiffness, antioxidant protection enzymes SOD and CAT boosting, amelioration of kidney damage caused by hypertension, and vasorelaxant effect on isolated thoracic aorta (
