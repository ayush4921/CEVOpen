<p> Flavonoid components such as quercetin, rutin, and hesperetin are widely investigated as cardioprotective agents, with its potency and efficacy varying on applied doses or plant they are isolated from. As they are present in different extracts of MO, they could also be responsible for cardiovascular effects of this plant, together with the others. To date, numerous beneficial effects of quercetin on cardiovascular system have been described including antihypertensive, antiatherosclerotic, anti-ischemic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects. Dozens of mechanisms are proven to be involved in these effects. First, increased bioavailability of NO and decreased NADPH oxidase and eNOS activity lead to vasodilation and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, all of them enabling better blood pressure regulation. Second, decreased oxidative stress, through augmentation of antioxidant protection enzymes CAT, SOD, and GSH; decreased lipid peroxidation; and decreased oxidation of LDL providing antiatherosclerotic action. Third, antiapoptotic effect and decrease of proinflammatory markers make quercetin a great candidate for cardiovascular drug (
