<p>Vasorelaxant effects of aqueous MOE on isolated thoracic aortic rings were first revealed and reported by 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Ersoy et al. (2008)</xref> They proved that aqueous MOE induces endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation, and that possible mechanism of this effect involves mainly nitric oxide (NO) pathway, but also EDHF (endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor) and prostacyclin pathways. It may be assumed that this vasorelaxation may be induced by monoterpene component citral and mediated by aortic Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> channel blockage also, besides NO pathway involvement. The reason for this is that it has been shown that methanolic MOE exhibits vasorelaxation by the Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> channel blockage (
