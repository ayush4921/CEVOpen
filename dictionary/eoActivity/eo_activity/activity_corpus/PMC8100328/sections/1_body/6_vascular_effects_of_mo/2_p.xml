<p>Antioxidant and cytoprotective effects of hydroalcoholic MOE were also confirmed at the cellular level in a model of H

 <sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress in HUVECs (human umbilical vein endothelial cells) vascular cells, almost a decade later. It was found that hydroalcoholic MOE protects the vascular cells against H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-induced toxicity only when applied at higher concentrations (100–500 μg/mL) as evidenced by FRAP assay, FOX1 method, and MTT assay. Importantly, MOE was investigated for an eventual toxicity on HUVECs, and it was proven that MOE did not change cell viability 24 h after the exposure, except in the case of the highest concentration of MOE (1,000 μg/mL) (

These cytoprotective effects of MOE are linked with the main component of MOE-RA, which provides vascular cytoprotective effects via several mechanisms: antioxidant (superoxide scavenging, inhibition of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation in human aortic endothelial cells) and antiangiogenetic (reduction in the expression of H

 <sub>2</sub>-dependent endothelial growth factor and release of interleukin 8 (IL-8) from endothelial cells and inhibition of the proliferation, migration, adhesion, and tube formation of HUVECs) (
