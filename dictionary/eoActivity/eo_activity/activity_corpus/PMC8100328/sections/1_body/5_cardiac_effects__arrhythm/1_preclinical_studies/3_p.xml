<p>Novel study pointed out potent cardioprotective effect of ethanolic MOE against cardiac I/R and subsequent arrhythmias in 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> rat model of regional heart ischemia (LAD model) (
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">Sedighi et al., 2019</xref>). Namely, 2-week oral application of this extract led to infarct size reduction, decrease of ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular ectopic beats episodes, stabilizing the ST segment changes and QTc shortening, and increased the R and T wave amplitudes and the heart rate during ischemia. Antiarrhythmic effects were dose-dependent, 100 mg/kg being the most effective dose of MOE. Cinnamic acid, as a major phenolic compound of this extract, was considered to be responsible for these effects via amelioration of oxidative stress. Rich phenolic content of lemon balm may induce cardioprotection in several mechanisms as reducing agents, free radical scavenging, and potential chelation of pro-oxidant metals (

 <sub>2</sub>-induced arrhythmia model in Sprague–Dawley rats. Two-week consumption of MOE decreased the heart rate and the incidence of ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and ventricular premature beats, especially in a higher dose of 200 mg/kg (

 <sup>2+</sup> channels and that these channels play an important role in pacemaker currents in atrioventricular node, this may be the mechanism of MOE’s heart rate–slowing property (

 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Hamza et al. (2016)</xref> Namely, they proved dose-dependent ability of MOE to preserve cardiac function and morphology in well-established doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity rat model via oxidative stress modulation and amelioration of both inflammation and apoptosis in rat heart. Surprisingly, optimal cardioprotection was induced by MOE in a dose of 750 mg/kg (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Hamza et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting great therapeutic index of MOE regarding safety and efficacy, as most previous studies that investigated the cardiovascular effects of MOE used lower doses such as 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg (

It is widely known that anthracycline antibiotic doxorubicin, commonly used for various malignancies, causes deleterious effects on the myocardium, leading to cardiomyopathy and/or subsequent heart failure, thus limiting its successful usage in oncology patients. In recent years, various studies unraveled the mechanisms of this cardiotoxicity including reactive oxygen species (ROS)–induced oxidative damage, interfering with inflammation and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes (
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">Zhao and Zhang, 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">Renu et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">Songbo et al., 2019</xref>). Ethanolic MOE in the dose of 750 mg/kg abolished all of these harmful effects of doxorubicin via amelioration of oxidative stress through increase in antioxidant capacity [superoxide dismutase (SOD)] and lipid peroxidation decrease (MDA reduction). Additionally, MOE abrogated inflammation by downregulating the expression of nuclear factor κ light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) genes and showed antiapoptotic activity through decrease in Bax and caspase-3 expression (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Hamza et al., 2016</xref>). What is more, MOE prevented the leakage of cardiac enzymes [creatine kinase myocardial band (CK-MB), troponin I, and troponin T] and preserved the morphology of the myocardium histopathologically when administered as adjuvant therapy with doxorubicin. Again, all of these beneficial effects of MOE extract are most likely induced by synergistic interactions of phenolic compounds and other triterpene acids of MOE.
