<p>One of the initial researches regarding this subject was conducted in the isolated rat hearts by using Langendorff technique. It has been revealed that acute application of aqueous MOE in the isolated rat heart had negative chronotropic effect, without the alteration of contractile force. Multiple mechanisms triggered by plant’s alkaloids may be considered responsible for these effects, such as stimulation of muscarinic receptors in the heart and/or by voltage-dependent calcium channel voltage blockage inducing bradycardia (

 <italic>ex vivo</italic> isolated rat heart model. They reported a mild antiarrhythmic effect of aqueous MOE compared to standard antiarrhythmic drug amiodarone, with multimodal mechanism of action. MOE application–induced slower heart electrical conduction through partial PR and QTc prolongation in electrocardiogram (ECG), decreased susceptibility to reperfusion–associated ventricular arrhythmias (fibrillation), and an improvement in blood pressure especially when given in a dose of 200 mg/kg intraperitoneally. All of these changes were of a less extent relative to amiodarone and attributed to both antioxidant effects of phenolic compounds in lemon balm and stimulation of muscarinic receptors, acetylcholine K
 <sup>+</sup> channels, which may be connected with slower conduction in the heart and prolonged PR interval (

One year later, the same research group evaluated the effect of 8-day consumption of water MOE in three different doses (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg) on ECG and electrophysiology of the rat heart. They reported that MOE consumption is associated with prolonged QRS, QTc, JT, and TpTe interval in a dose-dependent way with no alterations of RR interval, PR interval, amplitudes of ECG waves (P duration, P amplitude, Q amplitude, R amplitude, S amplitude, T amplitude, and ST height), heart rate, and blood pressure. QRS prolongation implies the possible antiarrhythmic effect of MOE by slowing ventricular conductivity, similarly to class I antiarrhythmics. On the other hand, QTc and JT prolongation induced by MOE is also characteristic for class III antiarrhythmics via blockage K
 <sup>+</sup> channels (

Nonetheless, both of these alterations could potentially turn into proarrhythmogenic if MOE is applied in higher doses, subsequently inducing early after-depolarizations that might increase the risk of ventricular extrasystoles, reentry phenomenon, and torsade de pointes arrhythmia (

Cardiac effects of MOE were also evaluated in a well-established model of isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction, emphasizing the importance of MOE dosage. They emphasized that lower doses of MOE (50 and 100 mg/kg) provide better cardioprotection by reducing the arterial pressure and heart rate and also by improving redox state via a decline in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. More importantly, this study added new facts regarding the safety of MOE, as high dose of MOE (200 mg/kg) led to intensification isoproterenol-induced cardiac injury under myocardial ischemia conditions, as a consequence from increasing of cardiac contractility, increasing of myocardial oxygen demand, and hence more risk of cardiac injury (
