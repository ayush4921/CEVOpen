<p>The usage of MO in cardiometabolic disease has been thoroughly explored in meta-analyses by 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Heshmati et al. (2020)</xref>, and it seems that MO application most likely lowers TC and SBP, according to several studies results. Because of its strong antioxidant activity, MOE may be useful in treating or preventing dyslipidemia and possibly subsequent atherosclerotic process. This hypothesis was confirmed in several experimental studies and clinical trials (

 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Heshmati et al., 2020</xref>). In order to achieve these effects in human, attention should be given to optimization of MOE dosage. LDL-lowering effects of MO were reported when applied in a dose of 1,000 mg three times daily

 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Asadi et al., 2018</xref>), whereas in patients with stable angina pectoris, higher doses (3 g/d) are needed to provide improvement in lipid profile (TC, LDL, HDL, TG), MDA, hs-CRP, and paraoxonase 1. Taking these aforementioned facts, the usage of MO may be a safe and useful way to improve metabolic markers and reduce the risk of cardiovascular consequences.
