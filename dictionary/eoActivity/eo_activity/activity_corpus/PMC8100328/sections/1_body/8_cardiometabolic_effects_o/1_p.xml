<p>Cardiometabolic diseases have become the leading cause of death in the modern era worldwide. The meaning of this term has been expanded, and nowadays, it refers to CVD, diabetes mellitus, and chronic renal failure (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">de Waard et al., 2019</xref>). Etiology is mostly explained by unhealthy sedentary lifestyle, lack of physical activity, inadequate diet, and smoking. A wide spectrum of risk factors that may lead to progression of cardiometabolic disease, including insulin resistance; increased TC, TGs, and LDL; and decreased HDL. In that sense, the plant extract supplementation may be of great importance as a prevention strategy for cardiometabolic diseases, as polyphenol-rich plants are recognized as safe and supplements with great benefit on the health, especially on lipid status and glycemia (

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Bolkent et al. (2005)</xref> were among the first to provide evidence about hypolipidemic properties of MOE. Namely, aqueous MOE when applied in a dose of 2 g/kg induced significant decrease in serum cholesterol and total lipids in high-fat diet model of hyperlipidemia in rats (
