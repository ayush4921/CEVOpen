<p>Although there is promising preclinical evidence regarding cardiovascular benefits of MOEs and essential oil application, there is an urgent need for clarification of the exact mechanisms of cardioprotection, safety, and pharmacokinetics of MO on cellular level, so the translation of these results into clinical practice could be possible. Additionally, optimization of dosage in human remains a challenge as reported cardiac benefits in animals are achieved with different doses (50â€“500 mg/kg), whereas improvement of cardiometabolic markers is achieved with much higher doses, which should be questioned in clinical practice. Given the fact that insufficiently is known regarding the possible interaction of MO formulations with frequently used cardiovascular drugs or other medicinal plants, future studies should be focused on these problems. Additionally, the usage of MO was investigated in various models of CVD; nonetheless, in inflammatory heart disease, it has not been investigated so far. Future studies should also focus on revealing the effects of MO in this pathology also, as there is evidence about its anti-inflammatory effects. This review provided detailed information regarding ethnomedical, preclinical, and possible clinical usage of MO in various cardiovascular entities.</p>
