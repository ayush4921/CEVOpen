<p>Therapeutic effects of MO in inflammatory heart disease have not been investigated to date. Nonetheless, over a decade ago, pioneer evidence regarding the influence of water MOE on immune response in mice was reported (

Additionally, several phenolic components present in MOE were shown to be beneficial in animal models of myocarditis, such as flavonoids quercetin, luteolin, and apigenin as they modulate immune response, decrease inflammation, and subsequently may suppress cardiac tissues remodeling, which occurs in dilative cardiomyopathy characteristic for chronic phase of myocarditis (

On the other hand, luteolin was proven to inhibit coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) replication via depressing the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and JNK MAPK and inhibiting NF-κB nuclear translocation and further attenuation of the inflammatory cytokine expression in CVB3-infected cells. Thus, luteolin may be beneficial in CVB3-induced myocarditis by inhibiting heart inflammation (
