<p>The use of herbs to relieve pain has a long history in the world of medicine. The fact that the essential oil of lemon balm has anti-inflammatory properties supports the traditional use of this herb in the treatment of numerous diseases associated with inflammation or pain (

Literature data indicate that anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive effects of MO are contributed to RA, as well as to flavonoids and terpenoids present in the extract. Although acute analgesic property of MOE does not differ from morphine or aspirin, its chronic analgesic effect is less effective. On the other hand, active principles in the MO inhibit the monoamine oxidase enzyme and thus prevent degradation of catecholamines, but also inhibit cyclooxygenase enzyme and decrease prostaglandins and inflammatory cytokine production as in response to inflammation stimuli. In this way, the traditional use of MO is absolutely justified in the treatment of inflammatory diseases (

Finally, taking into account that lemon balm essential oil is able to penetrate the skin, thanks to its lipophilic nature, it is worth noting that MO oil should be suitable for topical treatment of herpetic infection (
