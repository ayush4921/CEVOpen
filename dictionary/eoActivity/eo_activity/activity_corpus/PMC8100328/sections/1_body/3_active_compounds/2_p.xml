<p>A vast number of studies investigated the MO essential oil content and claim that the major compounds of MO essential oil are volatile compounds such as monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes citrals (geranial and neral, which give citrus-like aroma), geraniol, citronellal, thymol, and β-caryophyllene in different proportions. The presence of additional components and their percentage vary, depending on the method of obtaining the essential oil, distillation conditions, region’s climate, plant species, and maturity stage of MO (

Analysis of two essential oils obtained by hydrodistillation method from MO grown in Iran and Turkey discovered more than 20 different components and very similar content of the major components: citronellal (37.33% vs. 36.62–43.78%), thymol (11.96% vs. 0.40–11.94%), citral (10.10% vs. 10.10–17.43%), and β-caryophyllene (7.27% vs. 5.91–7.27%) (

On the other hand, MO essential oil obtained from Algeria is composed predominantly of oxygenated monoterpenes [neral (30.2%), geranial (44.2%) and citronellal (6.3%)], whereas the sesquiterpene fraction was lower: α-copaene (1.8%) and β-caryophyllene (1.3%) and oxygenated sesquiterpene caryophyllene oxide (1.3%) (

The essential oil of MO grown in Balkan, Serbia, was reported to be composed of mostly citrals (geranial + neral, 39.9%), citronellal (13.7%), limonene (2.2%), geraniol (3.4%), β-caryophyllene (4.6%), β-caryophyllene oxide (1.7%), and germacrene D (2.4%) (

The variability in essential oil composition obtained from 15 different MO subspecies grown under Central European climate conditions was recently investigated, with the aim to compare the content between two harvests in June or August. It seems that leaves collected in June are richer in oil compared to the ones collected in August, whereas the oil content [dominantly citrals (geranial, neral) and citronellal] does not significantly differ between these two cuts (

Namely, high fluctuations in the content exist when comparing the first and the second year of growth, in the favor of richer chemical composition of the 2 year-old plant (
