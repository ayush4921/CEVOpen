<p>Phytochemical examinations of the MO leaves have pointed out the presence of the following main compounds: previously mentioned monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes (

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Chizzola et al., 2018</xref>), triterpenes, and phenolic compounds such as polyphenols, phenolic acids [rosmarinic acid (RA), caffeic acid, protocatechuic acid] (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Ibragic et al., 2014</xref>), flavonoids (quercitrin, rhamnocitrin, luteolin) (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Mencherini et al., 2007</xref>), and tannins. Rich phenolic content of lemon balm is mostly responsible for its therapeutic effects, due to well-known antioxidant potential of these compounds, so it is important to optimize the extraction conditions to achieve optimal phenolic content and therefore the treatment goals. Phenolic content also varies, depending on the plant origin. For example, hot water extracts of lemon balm leaves of Bosnian origin have higher content of rosmarinic, gallic, and chlorogenic acid compared to Turkish one, whereas the content of cinnamic acid was higher in Turkish origin lemon balm (

 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">Tantry et al., 2014</xref>), but additional two sulfated ursane-type triterpenes, one sulfated oleanane-type triterpene, and one oleanane triterpene were confirmed in the hydroalcoholic extract of the lemon balm leaves (
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">Tantry et al., 2014</xref>). Triterpenes with sulfate groups in their structure, attached to the carbohydrate chain, are known to possess higher biological activity, relative to the one attached to the aglycone group (
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2014</xref>). Characteristically for Lamiaceae family, flavonoid compounds are mostly concentrated in the aerial parts of MO. Several flavonoid compounds have been isolated from lemon balm, divided into four groups by their chemical structure: flavones (luteolin, apigenin, and their derivatives), flavanones (hesperidin, hesperetin, naringin, naringenin), flavanols (catechin, epicatechin, rutin), and flavonols (isoquercitrin, rhamnocitrin) (
