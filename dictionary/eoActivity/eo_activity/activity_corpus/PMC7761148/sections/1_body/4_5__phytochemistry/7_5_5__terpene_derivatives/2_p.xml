<p>Looking at all compounds grouped by chemical structure, the largest proportion in the Polish samples consisted of monoterpene hydrocarbons (58–73%) and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (17–31%); oxygenated monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes (about 3% each), benzoic acid and salicilyc acids (about 1%) represent less than 10% of the total oil [

(2006) compared the composition of the essential oil from the aerial parts harvested from two different heights in the Russian Altai and found that the product harvested at a lower height (290 m) are richer in essential oil (0.22%), which contains higher amounts of α-pinene and myrcene as compared to the oil (0.07%) obtained from plants harvested at a more elevated height (650 m) [

The key compounds in this study were almost the same as in the specimens from Poland, the only notable exception being a higher content in β-caryophyllene for both specimens (maximum content in the Polish specimens was 3.3%, whereas in the Russian specimens the minimum content was 6.3%) [
