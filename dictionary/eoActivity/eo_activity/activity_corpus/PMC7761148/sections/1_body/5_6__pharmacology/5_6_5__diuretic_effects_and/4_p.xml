<p>Besides the assumed diuretic effects, S. virgaurea has been declared “the plant that is most frequently extracted to yield preparations for the treatment of bladder dysfunction including the overactive bladder syndrome” [
 <xref rid="B31-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In this sense, clinical data in patients with dysuria have claimed that 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic> reduces the frequency of urination (as well as the pain associated with it). In a relatively large (
 <italic>n</italic> = 512 patients), but open-label and uncontrolled study of patients with chronic recurrent overactive bladder, 96% of the subjects receiving 424.8 mg of 
 <italic>S. vigraurea</italic> extract, t.i.d., reported an improvement in the clinical global impression and a significant drop in painful micturition and in the need to urinate [

 <italic>n</italic> = 74), also open-label, carried out on female patients with dysuria, a reduction of the same symptoms was observed in 69% of the patients [
 <xref rid="B133-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. These results are somewhat puzzling because diuretics tend to rather increase the frequency of urination, but the diuretic data come from non-clinical studies with an isolated compound (leiocarposide) or the flavonoid fraction, and not with an extract as such. On the other hand, the open-label character and the lack of a control group indicate a low quality of these data and stronger evidence is needed to conclude on the effect 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic> have on the urinary tract. In vitro data have demonstrated that extracts of the plant have anti-muscarinic effects on the M2 and M3 receptors, which results in the inhibition of the bladder contraction [
