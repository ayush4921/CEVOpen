<p>An in vitro study evaluated the analgesic potential of a methanol seed extract by assessing its affinity for three receptors involved in acute pain signaling (bradykinin, neurokinin 1, and calcitonin gene related peptide). The extract exhibited substantial binding to the bradykinin receptor, but this effect was canceled by PVP treatment, allowing the authors to speculate that it should probably be ascribed to non-specific binding of tannins or other polyphenols [
