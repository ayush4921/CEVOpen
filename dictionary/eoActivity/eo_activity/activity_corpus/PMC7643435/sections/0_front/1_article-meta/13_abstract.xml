  <p id="Par1">Due to concerns regarding the safety of the chemical control measures, the trend is shifting globally towards the use of natural compounds as antimicrobial agent especially, plant essential oils.</p>

  <title>Results</title>
  <p id="Par2">This study presented the antibacterial potential of 
   <italic>Cymbopogon khasianus</italic> essential oil (CKEO) against human pathogens: 
   <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 
   <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>, 
   <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
   <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus subtilis</italic>, 
   <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
   <italic>Candida albicans</italic> with MIC ranging from 20 to 100 μg/mL. CKEO, in comparison to its major constituent, geraniol, showed better MICs against tested pathogens. In combination studies, the effective concentrations of CKEO and streptomycin were reduced from 20 to 5 μg/mL and 11 to 0.7 ng/mL against 
   <italic>E. coli</italic>. This suggests their synergistic action. However, CKEO showed partial synergy with ciprofloxacin. To understand the efficacy of CKEO, time-kill kinetics was performed
   <italic>.</italic> CKEO took the half time to show the bactericidal effect in comparison to streptomycin at their 2x MICs (double the MIC), while their combination took only 30 min for this. Fluorescence and surface electron microscopic and protein estimation studies suggested the multi-target action of CKEO-streptomycin combination against 
   <italic>E. coli</italic>. Further, CKEO alone/in combination exhibited less than 10% haemolytic activity at its MIC.

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p id="Par3">These results indicate that CKEO is a potentially safe alternative for the treatment of various pathogenic bacterial strains. It could be used for a variety of applications including human health, food storage, aquaculture, etc.</p>
