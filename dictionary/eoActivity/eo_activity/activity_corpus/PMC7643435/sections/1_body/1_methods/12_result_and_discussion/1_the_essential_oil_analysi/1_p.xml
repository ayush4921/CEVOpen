<p id="Par36">The GC/MS analysis of the CKEO from the leaves of plants collected from the north-western region of India showed 26 components representing 98.25% of the EO with geraniol (81.74%), geranyl acetate (5.39%), cis-β-ocimene (3.02%), linalool (1.27%) and trans-β-ocimene (1.25%). (Table S

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Choudhury and Leclercq [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] reported the same components in the CKEO from the leaves of plants with little variation in the percentage of geraniol (78.4%), geranyl acetate (7.3%), and linalool (2.2%) from the plants collected from the north-eastern region of India. The variation in the components of EO could be due to different eco-geographical regions. Some reports suggested that different varieties of 
 <italic>C. khasianus</italic> collected/selected from north-eastern region of India contained different major compounds such as methyl eugenol/elemicin/geraniol in their EOs [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Recently, a study revealed that part of the plant (inflorescence/leaves) used for extraction of EO affects the yield of essential oil (0.82/0.70%), but not its components [

 <italic>C. winterianus</italic> collected from Brazil and Germany, respectively [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. 
 <italic>C. nardus</italic> from Thailand contained geraniol (35.7%) as its major constituent, while 
 <italic>C. nardus</italic> from Malaysia did not contain geraniol [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Hence, in the recent past, a widest adaptable and stable variety (CIMAP Suwarna) of 
 <italic>C. khasianus</italic> was chosen using AMMI (additive main effects and multiplicative interactions) model [
