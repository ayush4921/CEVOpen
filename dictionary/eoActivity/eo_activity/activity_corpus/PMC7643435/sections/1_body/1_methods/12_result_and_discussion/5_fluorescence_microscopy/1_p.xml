<p id="Par45">To study the effect of antibacterial agents on bacterial membrane integrity, fluorescence microscopy was employed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. As shown in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, all bacterial cells in control were blue, whereas the treatment of cells with CKEO and their combination led both red and blue bacterial cells, suggesting it is a consequence of an impairment of membrane integrity. Hence the possible target of the CKEO is the bacterial membrane. Similarly, Zhang et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] found that cinnamon oil altered the integrity and permeability of 
 <italic>E. coil</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells, while Heydari et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] found that 
 <italic>Mentha piperita</italic> and 
 <italic>M. arvensis</italic> oils targeted the integrity of 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> cell membrane. However, bacterial cells treated with streptomycin had shown only the blue signal (DAPI), which suggested that streptomycin does not compromise membrane integrity/permeability.
