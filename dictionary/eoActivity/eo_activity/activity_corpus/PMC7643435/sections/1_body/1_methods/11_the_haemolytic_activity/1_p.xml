<p id="Par35">The haemolytic activity of CKEO, streptomycin alone and in combination was determined by using human red blood cells (RBCs) (blood used in the current study belongs to an author and was collected by the trained technician working in the dispensary of the Institute on his request) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Fresh human RBCs were separated after centrifugation and rinsed thrice with sterile Phosphate buffer solution (PBS pH 7.4). The RBCs pellet was re-suspended in PBS solution to obtain a 5% solution. RBCs suspension (50 μL) was added to 96-well plate containing 150 μL of different concentrations of samples. The plate was incubated for 30 min at room temperature and was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant (100 μL) was transferred to a fresh 96-well plate and optical density (OD) was recorded at 360 nm wavelength. Triton X-100 (0.1%) was used as a positive control. The haemolysis was calculated in percent using a formula (sample abs –PBS abs)/ triton X abs- PBS abs)*100 [
