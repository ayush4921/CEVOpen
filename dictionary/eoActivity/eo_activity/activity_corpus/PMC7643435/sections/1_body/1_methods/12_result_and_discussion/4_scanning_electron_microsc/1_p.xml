<p id="Par44">The change in surface morphology of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> when treated at MIC concentrations of streptomycin (0.011 μg/mL), CKEO (20 μg/mL) and in the combination of streptomycin (7 ng/mL) plus CKEO (5 μg/mL) were examined. The control cells (when grown in the absence of any oil and streptomycin) under scanning electron microscope were found normal rod shaped structures with a smooth surface (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). When treated with CKEO alone, small shrunken circular cells with wrinkled surface were observed, whereas with streptomycin treatment, cells became elongated. Cells treated with their combination had shown membrane shrinkage and destruction.
