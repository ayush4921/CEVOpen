<p id="Par46">Protein content in the extracellular medium of untreated and treated 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> cells was analyzed to understand the mechanism of CKEO, streptomycin, and their combination (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The analysis revealed the highest protein content in untreated 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> cells. Dalbey and Kuhn [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] reported that many proteins, which got assembled into the inner and outer membranes of gram-negative bacteria, were exported to the periplasm or the extracellular medium. Cells treated with streptomycin showed 46% less protein. This might be because of many reasons: firstly the number of live cells in the treated sample would be significantly less than control. Secondly, the cell membrane of the dead cell is not damaged, which was already confirmed by florescent microscopy. Cells treated with CKEO showed more protein (20%) in comparison to streptomycin treated cells. As florescent microscopy study depicted that CKEO damages membrane integrity, which caused the release of proteins to present inside the cells. In the combination studies, (when 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> cells were treated with one-fourth of CKEO and fifteen times less streptomycin) the protein content in the extracellular medium was found less in comparison to cells treated alone with CKEO, but more in comparison to cells treated alone with streptomycin. This protein content variation can be explained with results that streptomycin is not targeting cell membrane and inhibiting protein synthesis, which is a well-known fact. Hence, it might be involved in this interaction as well. Therefore, CKEO and streptomycin against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> acted in synergy but on multi-targets
 <italic>.</italic> Similar to our results, tea tree oil along with tobramycin, an aminoglycoside showed a synergistic effect against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. This was also an example of multi-target synergy.
