<p>HUVECs were seeded into 96-well plates (3 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> cells/well) and maintained overnight. The cells were then treated with various doses of HDE. Cell proliferation was measured in triplicate using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; Sigma-Aldrich) at 0.4 mg/ml (final concentration). The MTT formazan product in each well was dissolved in DMSO and absorbance was measured at a 595-nm wavelength with a microplate reader.
