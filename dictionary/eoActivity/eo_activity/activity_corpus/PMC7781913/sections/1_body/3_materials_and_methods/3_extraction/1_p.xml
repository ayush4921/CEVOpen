<p>Samples (50 g) of raw danshen and HHP-treated danshen were extracted for 4 h with 500 ml boiling water. The extract was filtered two times and then fractionated with ethyl acetate. Collected fractions were vacuum-dried. To compare extraction yield (%) according to HHP treatment, each extraction yield was calculated based on weight [(weight of extract obtained after vacuum drying (g))/(weight of raw material (50g)) × 100]. For 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, vacuum-dried samples were used by DMSO (µg/ml).
