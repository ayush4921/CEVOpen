<p>HHP treatment destroys cell wall structures and enhances solvent permeability of the cells (

 <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Therefore, HHP treatment of a raw danshen plant facilitates extraction of active principles via increased transfer of intracellular materials to the solvent. Raw danshen and HHP-pretreated danshen were extracted with the conventional boiling water extraction method (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The average extraction yield of HHP-treated danshen (0.97 ± 0.17) was about 1.3 times greater than that of raw danshen (0.72 ± 0.12) (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). This result indicated that HHP treatment effectively increased extraction yield of active principles from raw danshen.
