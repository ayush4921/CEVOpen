<p>Autophagy is highly associated with lysosome activity (
 <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Therefore, the effect of HDE on lysosome activity was examined using the lysosomotropic fluorescent dye, acridine orange, which stains acidic organelles in a pH-dependent manner. In the presence of oxLDL, HDE increased fluorescence intensity in RAW264.7 cells to about 1.5 times than that of the control. These results are consistent with the above results that HDE exhibits the autophagy induction activity (
