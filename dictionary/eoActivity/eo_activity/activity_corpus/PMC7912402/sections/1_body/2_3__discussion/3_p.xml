<p>Good antifungal effects on mycelial growth of 
 <italic>A. alternata</italic> were also seen here using the 
 <italic>Origanum</italic> essential oils. Even though the 
 <italic>O. majorana</italic> essential oils tested here had the same classes of compounds shown in a Brazilian species studied by Chaves et al. [
 <xref rid="B49-antibiotics-10-00104" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], they did not show pulegone as the main compound. An Italian species investigated by Della Pepa et al. [
 <xref rid="B50-antibiotics-10-00104" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] was in partial agreement with the present study for the high amount of terpinen-4-ol (29.6%), while a Tunisian oregano species were characterized by similar terpinen-4-ol content [

 <xref rid="B52-antibiotics-10-00104" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Moreover, Busatta et al. [
 <xref rid="B53-antibiotics-10-00104" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] showed that an Egyptian essential oil that was extracted by hydrodistillation of dried leaves of 
 <italic>O. majorana</italic> showed the same dominance of terpinen-4-ol (31.8%) and Î³-terpinene (13.0%). Although most studies on the composition of 
 <italic>Origanum</italic> essential oils have agreed on the main compounds from 
 <italic>O. majorana</italic> [
 <xref rid="B54-antibiotics-10-00104" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,
 <xref rid="B55-antibiotics-10-00104" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,

 <xref rid="B57-antibiotics-10-00104" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], these have indeed varied. The effectiveness of 
 <italic>Origanum</italic> might be due to its high content of terpinen-4-ol, a monoterpene alcohol that is known to have good antifungal activity, as previously reported against 
 <italic>Fusarium avenaceum</italic>, 
 <italic>Fusarium moniliforme</italic>, 
 <italic>Fusarium semitectum</italic>, 
 <italic>F. solani</italic>, 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>, and 
 <italic>F. graminearum</italic> [

 <xref rid="B59-antibiotics-10-00104" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Its fungicidal activity was also reported by Morcia et al. [
 <xref rid="B60-antibiotics-10-00104" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], who analyzed its potency on mycotoxigenic plant pathogens. However, Ebani et al. [
 <xref rid="B61-antibiotics-10-00104" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] showed weak activity of a tea tree essential oil on 
 <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> even though terpinen-4-ol was present at relatively high levels. This might be explained by the synergistic effects among all of the different components in each of the essential oils.
