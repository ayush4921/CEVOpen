<p>The 
 <italic>M. alternifolia</italic> essential oil in the present study was characterized by high levels of terpinen-4-ol (41.1%) and γ-terpinene (16.0%). These are comparable with the data reported by Elmi et al. [
 <xref rid="B62-antibiotics-10-00104" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] and Silva et al. [
 <xref rid="B63-antibiotics-10-00104" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. In their investigations of Italian and Brazilian, commercial essential oils, they confirmed the predominance of terpinen-4-ol (41.5%, 43.1%, respectively) and γ-terpinene (20.6%, 22.8%, respectively). They also reported relatively high levels of both α-terpinene (9.6%, 9.3%, respectively) and α-terpineol (4.4%, 5.2%, respectively), while in the present study these two compounds were present in lower amounts (6.1%, 3.7%, respectively). It is also interesting to note the high proportion of p-cymene (9.3%) in the present study. In a more recent study, α-terpineol (4.4%) and 1,8-cineol (4.0%) were found in relatively high amounts, together with terpinen-4-ol (30.2%) and γ-terpinene (16.9%) [
