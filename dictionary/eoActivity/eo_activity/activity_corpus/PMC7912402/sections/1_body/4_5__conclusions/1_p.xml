<p>The management of plant diseases using natural compounds is a great and important need nowadays. The present study has demonstrated the in vitro activities of seven essential oils and their efficacies against the fungi 
 <italic>A. alternata</italic> and 
 <italic>S. cucurbitacearum</italic>. These data show that the chemical compositions of essential oils can affect their antimicrobial activities. These essential oils were characterized by high proportions of oxygenated monoterpenes followed by monoterpene hydrocarbons. Essential oil with citral, Î²-myrcene, and geraniol as major components (i.e., lemongrass [
 <italic>C.cit</italic>],) controlled these fungi most effectively, followed by essential oils containing terpinen-4-ol or linalool (i.e., marjoram [
 <italic>O.maj1/2</italic>], tea tree [
 <italic>M.alt</italic>], lavandin [
 <italic>L.hyb</italic>]). Antifungal activity of essential oils can be ascribed to individual effect of major components, and/or due to a synergistic effect of its minor components. Further studies are required to determine the effects of these oils as seed treatments, to evaluate their potential as preventive and curative treatments.
