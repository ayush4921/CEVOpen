<p>As can be seen in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00104-f002">Figure 2</xref>, and as summarized in 
 <xref rid="antibiotics-10-00104-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="antibiotics-10-00104-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, all of these essential oils inhibited the growth of these two fungi in a dose-dependent manner. The greatest inhibitory activity was shown by the 
 <italic>C.cit</italic> essential oil, with 100% inhibition of mycelial growth of both 
 <italic>A. alternata</italic> and 
 <italic>S. cucurbitacearum</italic> reached at 0.6 mg/mL and 0.9 mg/mL, respectively (
 <xref rid="antibiotics-10-00104-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). 
 <italic>A. alternata</italic> was generally more sensitive to these essential oils than 
 <italic>S. cucurbitacearum</italic>, and at 1 mg/mL essential oils, its mycelia growth was inhibited by 55.0%, 71.5%, 68.2%, 36.1%, 74.2%, and 90.5% by 
 <italic>L.dent</italic>, 
 <italic>L.hyb</italic>, 
 <italic>M.alt</italic>, 
 <italic>L.nob</italic>, 
 <italic>O.maj1</italic>, and 
 <italic>O.maj2</italic>, respectively (
 <xref rid="antibiotics-10-00104-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). At the same essential oil concentration, 
 <italic>S. cucurbitacearum</italic> radial growth was inhibited by 73.5%, 74.0%, 73.7%, 65.3%, 60.0%, and 67.3%, respectively (
 <xref rid="antibiotics-10-00104-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The positive control of the fungicide combination of 25 g/L difenoconazole plus 25 g/L fludioxonil completely inhibited the mycelial growth of 
 <italic>A. alternata</italic> at all concentrations tested. Against 
 <italic>S. cucurbitacearum</italic>, this fungicide combination at 0.1, 0.5, and 1 mg/mL inhibited the mycelial growth by 75.7%, 84.9%, and 86.7%, respectively.
