<p>The 41 components given in 
 <xref rid="antibiotics-10-00104-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> were identified as comprising from 97.7% (
 <italic>O.maj1</italic>) to 100% (
 <italic>L.hyb</italic>) of these essential oils. The oxygenated monoterpenes dominated in all of the essential oils, even though these belonged to different plant families and species. They represented more than two-thirds of the fraction in three of the four 
 <italic>Lamiaceae</italic>: 
 <italic>L.dent</italic> (81.1%), 
 <italic>L.hyb</italic> (90.8%), and 
 <italic>O.maj2</italic> (66.8%). The oxygenated monoterpenes were also the highest proportionally in 
 <italic>C.cit</italic> (88.5%) and 
 <italic>L.nob</italic> (70.3%). On the other hand, the compositions of 
 <italic>M.alt</italic> and 
 <italic>O.maj1</italic> were divided mainly between oxygenated monoterpenes as the main class (48.1%, 49.7%, respectively) and monoterpene hydrocarbons in similar proportions (40.4%, 44.3%, respectively). In more detail, 
 <italic>C.cit</italic> showed α-citral (geranial; 51.6%) and β-citral (neral; 26.0%), whereby these two major oxygenated monoterpenes represented together over three-quarters of the total composition. In the 
 <italic>Lamiaceae</italic>, almost two-thirds of 
 <italic>L.dent</italic> was eucalyptol (63.5%) and β-selinene (4.1%). Instead, the total composition of 
 <italic>O.maj1</italic> and 
 <italic>O.mag2</italic> included around half and over two-thirds as terpenen-4-ol (44.8%) and 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (68.2%), respectively, followed by γ-terpinene (12.6%) for 
 <italic>O.maj1</italic> and α-terpineol (5.4%) for 
 <italic>O.maj2</italic>. For the two commercial essential oils, the main compounds of 
 <italic>L.hyb</italic> were linalool (33.7%) and linalyl acetate (27.7%), followed by camphor (9.3%), while 
 <italic>M.alt</italic> showed terpinen-4-ol (41.1%) as 86% of its oxygenated monoterpene, with γ-terpinene (16.0%), p-cymene (9.3%), and α-terpinene (6.1%), together representing 78% of the monoterpene hydrocarbons. Finally, more than half of the identified fractions of the 
 <italic>Lauraceae L.nob</italic> were characterized by the combination of eucalyptol (47.9%) and α-terpinyl acetate (10.2%).
