<p id="Par7">In this regard, the present study aimed to investigate the chemical profile, and the antifungal and anti-inflammatory activities of 
 <italic>Thymus albicans</italic> essential oil from Portugal and its major compounds, concomitantly highlighting the mechanisms of action underlying these effects. These bioactivities were selected taking into account their current relevance in the clinic. In fact, invasive fungal infections are an increasingly important global health burden accounting for 1.66 million deaths every year

 </sup>. While these mainly affect immunocompromised individuals, superficial fungal infections are reported to affect between 20 and 25% of the worldâ€™s population, including immunocompetent individuals

 </sup>. Treatment failure and high relapse rates are mainly correlated with the extensive use of a limited number of non-selective antifungal drugs (e.g. fluconazole, amphotericin B and terbinafine) which leads to off-target toxicity and to the emergence of resistance among the main etiologic agents

 </sup>. Chronic inflammation is another factor that contributes to the successful colonization of the host tissues by pathogenic fungi and may impede disease eradication
