<p id="Par15">In our study, 
 <italic>T. albicans</italic> essential oil was able to strongly inhibit the germ tube formation of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> at concentrations much lower than the respective MIC. At 0.08 μL/mL the oil inhibited germ tube formation by 40.5% and at 0.32 μL/mL a 96.3% inhibition was attained (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). These results are quite interesting since fluconazole, a conventional antifungal drug widely used in the clinic, despite inhibiting fungal growth at very low concentrations, is ineffective in decreasing germ tube formation. Indeed, even at concentrations up to 200 µg/mL the percentage of inhibition did not exceed 10% (Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Conversely, 
 <italic>T. albicans</italic> essential oil was able to strongly reduce 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> germ tube formation at concentrations as low as 0.08 µL/mL.
