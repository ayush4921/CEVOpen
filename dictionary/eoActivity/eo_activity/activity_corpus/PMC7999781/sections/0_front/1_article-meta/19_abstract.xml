 <p>In Tehuacán-Cuicatlán valley (Mexico), studies have been carried out on the essential oils of medicinal plants with antimicrobial activity and it was found that they present compounds in common such as: α-pinene, β-pinene, carvacrol, eugenol, limonene, myrcene, ocimene, cineole, methyl salicylate, farnesene, and thymol. The goal of this study was to assess the antimicrobial activity of essential oils’ compounds. The qualitative evaluation was carried out by the Kirby Baüer agar diffusion technique in Gram-positive bacteria (11 strains), Gram-negative bacteria (18 strains), and yeasts (8 strains). For the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), the agar dilution method was used. All the evaluated compounds presented antimicrobial activity. The compounds eugenol and carvacrol showed the largest inhibition zones. Regarding yeasts, the compounds ocimene, cineole, and farnesene did not show any activity. The compounds eugenol, carvacrol, and thymol presented the lowest MIC; bactericidal effect was observed at MIC level for 
  <italic>S. aureus</italic> 75MR, 
  <italic>E. coli</italic> 128 MR, and 
  <italic>C albicans</italic> CUSI, for different compounds, eugenol, carvacrol, and thymol. Finally, this study shows that the essential oils of plants used by the population of Tehuacán-Cuicatlán valley share compounds and some of them have antibacterial and fungicidal activity.
