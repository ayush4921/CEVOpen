   <bold>a</bold>) Survival curve of 
   <italic>E. coli</italic> exposed to carvacrol. Data are represented as the mean ± S.E. (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3). The concentrations used were: 0.062 mg/mL (½ MIC), 0.125 mg/mL (MIC), and 0.25 mg/mL (MBC); the control group (T) only contains the bacterial culture. (

   <italic>S. aureus</italic> 75MR exposed to carvacrol. Data are represented as the mean ± S.E. (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3). The concentrations used were: 0.062 mg/mL (½ MIC), 0.125 mg/mL (MIC), and 0.25 mg/mL (MBC); the control group (T) only contains the bacterial culture. (
   <bold>c</bold>) Survival curve of 
   <italic>C. albicans</italic> CUSI exposed to carvacrol. Data are represented as the mean ± S.E. (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3). The concentrations used were: 0.01 mg/mL (½ MIC), 0.03 mg/mL (MIC), and 0.062 mg/mL (MBC); the control group (T) only contains the bacterial culture.
