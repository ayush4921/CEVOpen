The α-pinene and β-pinene compounds presented MICs above 4 mg /mL, these being the highest values for both bacterial types. The compounds carvacrol, eugenol, and thymol presented the lowest MICs in yeast (
 <xref rid="antibiotics-10-00295-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>), and low concentrations of 0.062 to 0.25 mg/mL were required to drastically inhibit the growth of challenged populations. The other compounds that showed activity presented concentrations greater than or equal to 2 mg/mL.
