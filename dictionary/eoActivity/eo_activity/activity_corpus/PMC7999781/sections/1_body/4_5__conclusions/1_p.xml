<p>There are no significant differences in the antimicrobial activity of the compounds on the different bacterial groups and yeasts. The compounds carvacrol, eugenol, and thymol were those that showed the highest antimicrobial activity. Carvacrol was the component with the highest antibacterial activity, followed by eugenol and thymol. Carvacrol was the component with the highest antifungal activity, followed by thymol and lastly eugenol. The compounds ocimene, cineole, and farnesene did not show activity on any yeast strain. A bactericidal effect was observed at concentrations equal to or greater than MIC for eugenol, thymol, and carvacrol.
