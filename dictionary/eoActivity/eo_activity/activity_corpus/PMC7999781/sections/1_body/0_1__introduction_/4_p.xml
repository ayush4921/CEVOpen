<p>The International Union for the Conservation of Nature has decreed that Tehuacán-Cuicatlán valley [comprises the region from Puebla to Oaxaca State, México] is a center of mega diversity and endemism [

 <xref rid="B7-antibiotics-10-00295" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Various studies have been carried out on the essential oils of some species such as: 
 <italic>Lantana achyranthifolia</italic> Desf. (Verbenaceae) [

 <xref rid="B9-antibiotics-10-00295" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], 
 <italic>Lippia graveolens</italic> H.B.K. (Verbenaceae) [

 <xref rid="B10-antibiotics-10-00295" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], 
 <italic>Cordia curassavica</italic> (Boraginaceae) [

 <xref rid="B12-antibiotics-10-00295" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and 
 <italic>Gymnolaena oaxacana</italic> (Greenman) Rydb. (Asteraceae) [
 <xref rid="B13-antibiotics-10-00295" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], among others, and it was found that they contain many compounds in common among them: α-pinene, β-pinene, carvacrol, eugenol, limonene, myrcene, ocimene, cineole, methyl salicylate, farnesene, and thymol. Some studies have been carried out on these compounds, among which we can mention thymol [

 <xref rid="B17-antibiotics-10-00295" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], α-pinene [
 <xref rid="B18-antibiotics-10-00295" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and eugenol [

 <xref rid="B20-antibiotics-10-00295" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-antibiotics-10-00295" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and it was observed that they present antimicrobial activity in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains affecting respiratory metabolism, structural changes of DNA, and cell membrane permeability.
