<p>The compounds eugenol, carvacrol, and thymol showed the highest antimicrobial activity against Gran positive bacteria, Gran negative bacteria, and yeast. Statistical analysis revealed no significant differences between the compounds and the different groups of microorganisms (bacteria and yeast), indicating that the essential oil compounds can act in different ways. Some authors mention that the sensitivity of Gram-negative bacteria to the different essential oil compounds is due to their outer membrane of lipopolysaccharides, which restricts the diffusion to hydrophobic compounds [
