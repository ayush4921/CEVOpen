<p>The structural differences between the compounds are also the cause of the different activities observed. Myrcene (7-methyl-3 -methylene-1,6-octadiene) and ocimene (3,7-dimethyl-1,3,6-octatriene) differ in the position of a double bond (C-3), causing one to present activity on yeast (myrcene) and the other not (ocimeno); carvacrol and thymol differ in the position of a hydroxyl group (in thymol is in ortho position, in carvacrol it is in meta position), causing the deterioration of enzyme systems by binding to the active sites of the enzymes responsible for producing energy and synthesis of structural components, and the destruction or inactivity of genetic material [

Thymol and carvacrol are lipophilic and can enter between the fatty acid chains that make up the lipid bilayers of the membrane, altering the fluidity and permeability of cell membranes; in the case of yeast, compounds such as carvacrol can affect the regulation and the functioning of membrane enzymes that catalyze the synthesis of a series of important polysaccharide components of the cell wall, such as Î²-glucans, chitin, and mannan, which are involved in cell growth and morphogenesis [
