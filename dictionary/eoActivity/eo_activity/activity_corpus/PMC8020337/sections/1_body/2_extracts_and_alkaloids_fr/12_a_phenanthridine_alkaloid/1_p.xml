 <italic>Zanthoxylum schinifolium</italic> exhibited significant inhibition of NF-κB activation in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, these compounds inhibited TNF-α-induced expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 mRNA, and dose-dependent inhibition of iNOS promoter activity.
