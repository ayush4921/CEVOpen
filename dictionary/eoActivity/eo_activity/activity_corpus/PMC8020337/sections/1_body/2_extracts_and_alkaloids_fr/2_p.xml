<p>Inflammation is a defense system that removes deleterious stimuli or microbial infections. When the inflammatory responses are initiated, damaged tissue is rapidly repaired by eliciting the appropriate signals.
 <xref rid="cit0087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref> Inflammation has relevance to numerous diseases, including viral diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic bronchitis, asthma, and cancer.

 <xref rid="cit0089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref> Many members of the TLR family are involved in controlling the inflammatory response. After TLR activation, they are dimerized or collaborate with other receptors at the cell surface.
 <xref rid="cit0090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref> The myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) gene is the most generally used TLR adaptor. The MyD88-dependent pathway initiates the formation of a cytoplasmic Toll-interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain. MyD88 is recruited through TIR domain interaction, promoting the recruitment of IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK-4) (the death domain of IRAK-4 interacts with the death domain of MyD88) and the phosphorylation of IRAK-1. These enzymes induce the activation of the inhibitory κB (IκB) kinase complex. Phosphorylated IκB undergoes proteasomal degradation, which in turn activates NF-κB. The released NF-κB translocates to the nucleus and binds DNA, regulating the expression of a wide range of genes encoding inflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα and interleukin-6 (IL-6)

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0009">Figure 9</xref>). Many natural alkaloids have been shown to regulate the NF-κB signaling pathway. Inflammation alters the expression of several cellular genes and a cellular signaling network, including MAPK and JAK-STAT signaling pathways, occurs during inflammation.
