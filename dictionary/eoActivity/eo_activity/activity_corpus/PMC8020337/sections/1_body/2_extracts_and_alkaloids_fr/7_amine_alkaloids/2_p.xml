<p>The potential antiviral mechanisms of compounds from 
 <italic>Ephedra sinica</italic> Stapf have been investigated. L-Methylephedrin (LMEP, 
 <bold>77</bold>), L-ephedrine (LEP, 
 <bold>78</bold>), and D-pseudo-ephedrine (DPEP, 
 <bold>79</bold>) significantly inhibited the proliferation of influenza A virus in vitro. These compounds also significantly inhibited the mRNA expression levels of related genes in the TLR3, TLR4, and TLR7 signaling pathways, which was accompanied by the down-regulation of TNF-α levels and the up-regulation of IFN-β levels in the cell supernatant. Animal research further indicated, at the 3rd and 7th days after infection, that LEP and DPEP significantly attenuated lung injury, decreased the lung index, the virus load in the lung, and the level of IL-1β in serum, inhibited the mRNA expression levels of TNF-α, TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, MyD88, NF-κB p65, and RIG-1, as well as the protein expression levels of TLR4, TLR7, MyD88, and NF-κB p65, and markedly increased the thymus index, the level of IL-10 in serum, and the mRNA expression level of IFN-γ.
