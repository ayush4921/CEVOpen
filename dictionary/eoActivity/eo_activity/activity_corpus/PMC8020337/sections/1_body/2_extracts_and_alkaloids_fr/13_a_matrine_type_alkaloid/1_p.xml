 <italic>Sophora</italic> root.
 <xref rid="cit0108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref> Oxymatrine had excellent anti-influenza A virus activity against eight strains in vitro. Oxymatrine significantly decreased the promoter activities of the TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, MyD88, and TRAF6 genes, inhibited virus-induced activation of the Akt, ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and NF-κB pathways, and suppressed the expression of inflammatory cytokines and MMP-2/9. Activators of the TLR4, p38 MAPK, and NF-κB pathways significantly antagonized the anti-influenza activity of oxymatrine in vitro, including virus replication and virus-induced cytopathogenic effects.
