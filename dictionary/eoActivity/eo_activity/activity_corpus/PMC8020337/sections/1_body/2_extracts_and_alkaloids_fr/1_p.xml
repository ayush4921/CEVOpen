<p>Many viral infections, such as influenza virus infections, are characterized by an excessive inflammatory response, and the viral load does not correlate with the worsening of symptoms.

Immunological complications, such as a cytokine storm can occur, and thus antiviral treatment alone is not enough and should be combined with appropriate anti-inflammatory agents.</p>
