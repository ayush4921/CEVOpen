<p>BBR reduces virus replication and targets specific interactions between the virus and its host. BBR inhibits the replication of HSV, human cytomegalovirus, human papillomavirus, and HIV. This alkaloid has the ability to regulate the MEK-ERK, AMP-activated protein kinase/mTOR, and NF-ÎºB signaling pathways, which are necessary for viral replication. Furthermore, it has been reported that BBR can support the host immune response leading to viral clearance.
