<p>Colchicine (
 <bold>82</bold>) is a widely available, inexpensive drug with a range of anti-inflammatory properties. Colchicine affects the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome, thereby reducing the release of IL-1β and other interleukins, including IL-6, that are formed in response to danger signals. In endothelial cells, colchicine inhibits the production of IL-1β and the expression of E-selectin required for neutrophil adhesion.
 <xref rid="cit0101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref> Colchicine can limit the extent of inflammatory injury by promoting anti-inflammatory macrophages to release IL-10, TGF-β, and other anti-inflammatory cytokines that act to suppress proinflammatory signaling and promote favorable healing by dampening the growth of vascular smooth muscle cells.
