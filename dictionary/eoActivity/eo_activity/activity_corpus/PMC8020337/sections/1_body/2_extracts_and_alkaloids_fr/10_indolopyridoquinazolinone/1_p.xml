<p>Two indolopyridoquinazolinone alkaloids, rutaecarpine (
 <bold>85</bold>) and evodiamine (
 <bold>86</bold>), as well as the structurally related quinazoline-2,4-dione, goshuyuamide II, were evaluated for their anti-inflammatory activities. These compounds strongly inhibited PGE2 synthesis in LPS-treated RAW 264.7 cells at 1–10 μM, and evodiamine also inhibited cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) induction and NF-κB activation.
