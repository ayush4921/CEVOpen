<p>Anti-inflammatory activity of BBR (
 <bold>32</bold>) has been indicated by the reduction of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-13, IL-6, IL-8, and IFN-γ. In cell models, BBR was able to completely antagonize the TNF-α-mediated barrier defects, which are related to tyrosine kinase, and the pAkt and NF-κB pathways.
 <xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> BBR significantly inhibited the binding of NF-κB and AP-1 at concentrations of 4–10 M or higher. BBR also inhibited LPS-induced MCP-1/CCL2 production in vitro via AP-1 and NF-κB-dependent pathways.

 <xref rid="cit0096" ref-type="bibr">96–99</xref> It has been reported that BBR repressed proinflammatory responses through AMP-activated protein kinase activation in macrophages, significantly down-regulating the expression of proinflammatory genes, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, monocyte chemo-attractant protein-1 (MCP-1), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2).
