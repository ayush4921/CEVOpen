<p>Epigoitrin (
 <bold>46</bold>), a natural alkaloid from 
 <italic>Isatis indigotica</italic>, provides protection against influenza infection by reducing the host’s susceptibility to the influenza virus under stress. Epigoitrin significantly decreased the susceptibility of mice to an influenza virus as evidenced by lower mortality, attenuated inflammation, and decreased viral replication in the lungs. In addition, epigoitrin reduced the protein expression of mitofusin-2, which elevated mitochondria antiviral signaling protein expression and subsequently increased the production of IFN-β and interferon-inducible transmembrane 3, thereby helping to fight viral infections. This study indicated that epigoitrin reduced the susceptibility to the influenza virus via mitochondrial antiviral signaling.
