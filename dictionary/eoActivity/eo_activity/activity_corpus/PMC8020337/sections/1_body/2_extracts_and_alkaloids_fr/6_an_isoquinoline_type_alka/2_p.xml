<p>BBR (
 <bold>32</bold>), a natural isoquinoline alkaloid isolated from the 
 <italic>berberis</italic> species, has a wide array of biological properties, such as anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antifungal, and antihelminthic effects. BBR relieved pulmonary inflammation, and reduced necrosis, inflammatory cell infiltration, and pulmonary edema, induced by a viral infection in mice when compared with vehicle‐treated mice. BBR suppressed the viral infection‐induced up‐regulation of components of the TLR7 signaling pathway, such as TLR7, MyD88, and NF‐κB (p65), at both the mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, BBR significantly inhibited the viral infection-induced increases in the Th1/Th2 and Th17/Treg ratios, as well as the production of inflammatory cytokines.
