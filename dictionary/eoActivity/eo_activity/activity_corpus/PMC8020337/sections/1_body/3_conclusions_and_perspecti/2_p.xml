<p>Viral infections are a worldwide public health problem that affects a large proportion of the worldâ€™s population. Medicinal plants or herbs have been widely used to treat various infectious diseases for thousands of years. Literature reviews have demonstrated that plants are therapeutically effective for treating viral diseases. Medicinal plants and herbs are recognized as a rich source of therapeutic agents for the management of viral disorders. The active constituents of plants, such as alkaloids, have been reported to have antiviral activity. Such compounds can function by interacting with different viral protein receptors and have been shown to play an important role in the management of viruses and the inflammatory response in host models. Although the contribution of modern synthetic medicine for elevating human suffering cannot be underestimated, the fact that synthetic drugs exert serious side effects cannot be ignored. In the future, more scientific studies are needed to develop alkaloidal compounds as antiviral therapeutic agents and potential regulators of the host immune response.</p>
