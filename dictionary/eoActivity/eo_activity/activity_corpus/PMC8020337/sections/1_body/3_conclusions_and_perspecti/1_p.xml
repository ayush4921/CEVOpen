<p>Alkaloids have attracted considerable attention from researchers worldwide since the study of alkaloids began in 1803 when nicotine was discovered. Alkaloids represent a promising and expanding platform for the development of active natural compounds as new pharmaceuticals. The molecular structures of alkaloids provide valuable leads for antiviral drug design. Isoquinoline (BBR, 
 <bold>32</bold>) alkaloids exhibit broad-spectrum antiviral activity, including activity against HIV, HCV, IFV, HSV and may also reduce related anti-inflammatory activities. Quinoline alkaloid compounds have provided a new route for drug development via the treatment of both HIV and HCV infections. The discovery of aloperine (
 <bold>1</bold>), a quinolizidine-type lead compound, which functions by virus-induced cell-cell fusion, has provided a route to develop drugs that target both HIV and HCV infections. In addition to the activities mentioned herein, alkaloids exhibit other important bioactivities, including antifungal, antiparasitic, insecticidal, and antiplatelet activities. We hope that such alkaloids will provide more avenues for the development of new drugs in the future through targeted pharmacological viral infected host modeling and the resulting synthetic modifications.
