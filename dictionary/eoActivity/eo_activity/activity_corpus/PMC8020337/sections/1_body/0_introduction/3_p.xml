<p>Alkaloids are a class of chemical compounds that are usually alkaline in nature and have at least one nitrogen atom in a heterocyclic ring. Alkaloids possess a wide range of biological activities including antimalarial, antiasthmatic, anticancer, antihypertensive, antispasmodic, antiarrhythmic, analgesic, antibacterial, and antidiabetic effects, as well as having CNS stimulant, muscle relaxant, and vasodilatory properties.
 <xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> According to their chemical structure, alkaloids can be divided into groups, including the piperidine alkaloids, isoquinoline alkaloids, indole alkaloids, terpenoid alkaloids, steroidal alkaloids, and quinoline alkaloids. There are numerous examples of bioactive alkaloids that are found both naturally and are available as synthetic products, including quinine, ephedrine, lobeline, theobromine, vincristine, vinblastine, serpentine, reserpine, ergotamine, nicotine, caffeine, vasicine, tubocurarine, curarine, atropine, aconitine, morphine, and piperine. Alkaloids are present in numerous plants. For example, piperidine alkaloids exist in many genera including
