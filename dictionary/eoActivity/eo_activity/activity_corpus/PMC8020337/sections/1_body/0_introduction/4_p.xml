<p>In recent years, antiviral treatments using alkaloids have received increasing attention. Interestingly, many researchers have reported that alkaloids can be used to prevent and treat viral diseases. Additionally, alkaloids regulate human immune mechanisms to achieve viral resistance. They do not directly kill viral particles but instead function by promoting humoral immunity, type I IFN production, type I IFN signaling transduction, and other anti-inflammatory mechanisms.
 <xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Therefore, this review mainly focuses on a summary of recent progress and advantages of herb-based antiviral research and various alkaloids related to anti-HIV, anti-HBV, anti-HCV, anti-IFV, anti-HSV, anti-enterovirus 71, etc. and the anti-inflammatory responses based on the literature from 2009 to 2019. The present review provides a comprehensive scientific summary of naturally occurring alkaloids that are pharmacologically active against viruses, and related anti-inflammatory effects. The authors hope that this review will provide new possibilities for the anti-virus new drug discovery from these alkaloids.
