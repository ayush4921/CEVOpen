<p>Two C19-diterpenoid alkaloids, hypaconitine (
 <bold>64</bold>) and mesaconitine (
 <bold>65</bold>), have been isolated from the ethanol extract of the root of 
 <italic>Aconitum carmichaelii</italic> Debx. In an in-vitro antiviral activity test, compounds 
 <bold>64</bold> and 
 <bold>65</bold> had inactivation efficacy values of 82.4 and 85.6, respectively, against TMV at 500 μg/mL. Compound 
 <bold>65</bold> had an inactivation activity of 52.1% against CMV at 500 μg/mL, which was almost equal to that of the commercial drug ningnanmycin.
