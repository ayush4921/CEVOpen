<p>BBR (
 <bold>32</bold>), a natural isoquinoline alkaloid, has been evaluated for its antiviral effect against influenza H1N1 in vivo and in vitro. The results showed that BBR strongly suppressed viral replication in A549 cells and in mouse lungs. BBR also relieved pulmonary inflammation and reduced necrosis, inflammatory cell infiltration, and pulmonary edema induced by a viral infection in mice when compared with vehicle-treated mice. BBR suppressed the viral infection-induced up-regulation of components of the TLR7 signaling pathway, such as TLR7, MyD88, and NF-ÎºB (p65), at both the mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, BBR significantly inhibited the viral infection-induced increases in Th1/Th2 and Th17/Treg ratios, as well as the production of inflammatory cytokines.
 <xref rid="cit0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> BBR exhibited antiviral effects on the influenza virus both in vitro and in vivo. The possible therapeutic mechanism of BBR on influenza-induced viral pneumonia might be through inhibition of the virus infection, as well as improvements in the pathogenic changes by repressing the release of inflammatory substances.
