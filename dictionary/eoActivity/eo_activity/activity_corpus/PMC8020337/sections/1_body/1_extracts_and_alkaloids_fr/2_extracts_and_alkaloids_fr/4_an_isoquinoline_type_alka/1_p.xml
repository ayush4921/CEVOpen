<p>Emetine (
 <bold>2</bold>) is an alkaloid that possesses a monoterpenoid-tetrahydroisoquinoline skeleton. Emetine occurs in three plant families, including Alangiaceae, Icacinaceae, and Rubiaceae, and the major source of emetine is 
 <italic>Psychotria ipecacuanha</italic> Stokes (Rubiaceae). Emetine is an anti-HIV agent that blocks HIV-1 infection in primary and established cells at noncytotoxic levels and its effects are mediated by reverse transcription inhibition. Emetine also blocked HIV-1 infection of a variant strain harboring an NRTI-resistance mutation.
 <xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> The isoquinoline alkaloids laurolitsine (norboldine, 
 <bold>3</bold>) isolated from the family Lauraceae belong to the aporphinic group, which contain only one benzyl tetrahydroisoquinoline group. Laurolitsine showed a significant inhibitory effect on HIV-1 integrase with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 16.3 mM.
