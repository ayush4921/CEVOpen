<p>Hirsutine (
 <bold>62</bold>), an indole alkaloid of 
 <italic>Uncaria rhynchophylla</italic>, has been identified as a potent anti-dengue (DENV) compound exhibiting high efficacy and low cytotoxicity. Hirsutine showed antiviral activity against all DENV serotypes. Time-of-drug-addition and time-of-drug-elimination assays indicated that hirsutine inhibited the viral particle assembly, budding, or release step but not the viral translation and replication steps in the DENV lifecycle. A subgenomic replicon system was used to confirm that hirsutine does not restrict viral genome RNA replication. Hirsutine is a DENV inhibitor and a potential candidate for treating dengue fever.
