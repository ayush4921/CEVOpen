<p>Berberine (BBR, 
 <bold>32</bold>) is an isoquinoline alkaloid that has been isolated from several plants belonging to the 
 <italic>Berberis</italic> genus and is a traditional component of Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine. BBR is a potent HCV entry inhibitor that specifically impedes HCVcc attachment and entry/fusion steps without inactivating the free virus particles or affecting the expression of host cell entry factors and post-entry viral replication. BBR also effectively inhibited infection by viral pseudoparticles expressing HCV E1/E2 glycoproteins, and molecular docking analysis pointed at a potential interaction with HCV E2. In addition, BBR suppressed HCVcc infection of primary human hepatocytes.
