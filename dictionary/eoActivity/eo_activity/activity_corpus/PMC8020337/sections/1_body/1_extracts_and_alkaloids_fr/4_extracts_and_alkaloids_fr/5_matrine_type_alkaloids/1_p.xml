<p>IMB-DM122 (
 <bold>33</bold>) was designed and semi-synthesized using matrine as the lead compound. Compound 
 <bold>33</bold> was found to be an effective and safe inhibitor of Hsc70 mRNA/protein expression in human hepatocytes. Compound 
 <bold>33</bold> inhibited HCV replication through the destabilization of Hsc70 mRNA, and the half-life of host Hsc70 mRNA was reduced by 78% after treatment with 
 <bold>33</bold>. Compound 
 <bold>33</bold> appeared to be highly efficient at inhibiting Hsc70-related HCV replication. In addition, compound 
 <bold>33</bold> showed a good safety profile in vitro as well as in vivo with no indication of harmful effects on liver and kidney functions
