<p>Buchapine (
 <bold>4</bold>), a quinoline alkaloid, was isolated from a methanolic extract of the epigeal parts of 
 <italic>Haplophyllum bucharicum, Haplophyllum tuberculatum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Euodia roxburghiana</italic>. 3-(3-Methyl-2-butenyl)-4-[(3-methyl-2-butenyl)oxy]-2(1H)-quinolinone (
 <bold>5</bold>) was also isolated from 
 <italic>H. tuberculatum</italic> and 
 <italic>E. roxburghiana</italic>. Compounds 
 <bold>4</bold> and 
 <bold>5</bold> exhibited anti-HIV activities against HIV-1 in cultured human lymphoblastoid CEM-SS cells with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 29.0 μM and 26.9 μM, respectively. Buchapine derivatives of quinoline 2,4-diol were synthesized and tested for their anti-HIV potential in the human CD4+ T cell line CEM-GFP. Compounds 
 <bold>6–9</bold> have displayed good anti-HIV activities with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 8.76, 11.60, 8.95, and 19.34 μM, respectively.
 <xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> The methanol extract of 
 <italic>Melochia odorata</italic> yielded four quinoline alkaloids, including waltherione A (
 <bold>10</bold>) and waltherione A (
 <bold>11</bold>). Compounds 
 <bold>10</bold> and 
 <bold>11</bold> showed significant antiviral activity in an in vitro anti-HIV cytoprotection assay at concentrations of 56.2 and 0.83 μM, respectively, and inhibited HIV P24 formation by more than 50% at concentrations of 1.7 and 0.95 μM, respectively
