 <italic>Sophora flavescens</italic> is a species of plant in the genus Sophora. Ku shen (the root) or kushenin (a flavonoid compound) are typical traditional Chinese medicines that are derived from this plant. 
 <italic>Sophora flavescens</italic> is commonly used for the treatment of viral hepatitis, cancer, viral myocarditis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and skin diseases (such as colpitis, psoriasis, and eczema). Five matrine-type alkaloids, flavesine G (
 <bold>12</bold>), flavesine J (
 <bold>13</bold>), alopecurine B (
 <bold>14</bold>), oxymatrine (
 <bold>15</bold>), and sophoridine (
 <bold>16</bold>), were isolated from the roots of 
 <italic>Sophora flavescens</italic>. Compounds 
 <bold>12–16</bold> were evaluated for their anti-HBV activities in HepG2.2.15 cells. Compounds 
 <bold>12–16</bold> significantly inhibited HBsAg secretion by 37.2%, 44.3%, 46.0%, 38.3%, and 40.2%, respectively, at noncytotoxic concentrations of 0.2 or 0.4 mM, which suggested that these alkaloids had comparable potencies to matrine (34.7% at a concentration of 1.0 mM), and were more active than the positive control lamivudine (31.5% at a concentration of 1.0 mM).
 <xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Five matrine-type alkaloid dimers, flavesine A (
 <bold>17</bold>), flavesine B (
 <bold>18</bold>), flavesine D (
 <bold>19</bold>), and flavesine E (
 <bold>20</bold>), were isolated from the roots of 
 <italic>Sophora flavescens</italic>. Compounds 
 <bold>17–20</bold> were evaluated for their anti-HBV activities in HepG2.2.15 cells using real-time PCR. The results revealed that compounds 
 <bold>17–20</bold> exhibited inhibitory effects on the expression of HBV DNA in HepG2.2.15 cells with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 44.85 ± 7.30, 86.60 ± 4.30, 74.28 ± 0.31, and 70.62 ± 0.93 μM, respectively, while the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of the positive control PFA (foscarnet) was 105.53 ± 8.57 μM.
 <xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Three matrine-based alkaloids, sophaline B (
 <bold>21</bold>), sophaline C (
 <bold>22</bold>), and sophaline D (
 <bold>23</bold>), were isolated from the seeds of 
 <italic>Sophora alopecuroides</italic>. Compound 
 <bold>21</bold> possesses a previously unknown 6/5/6/6 ring system. Compounds 
 <bold>21–23</bold> were tested for their antiviral activities against HBV in HepG2.2.15 cells. The results of the assays showed that compounds 
 <bold>21–23</bold> significantly inhibited HBsAg secretion by more than 50% at noncytotoxic concentrations of 0.2 or 0.4 mM.
