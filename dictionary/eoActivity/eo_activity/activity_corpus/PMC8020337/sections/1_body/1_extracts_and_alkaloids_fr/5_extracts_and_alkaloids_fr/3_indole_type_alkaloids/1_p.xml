 <italic>Isatis indigotica</italic> is an important medicinal plant in China. The dried leaves and roots of 
 <italic>Isatis indigotica</italic> are widely used in traditional Chinese medicine for curing diseases caused by bacteria and viruses, such as influenza and viral pneumonia. Isatibisindosulfonic acid B (
 <bold>36</bold>) and isatindosulfonic acid B (
 <bold>37</bold>), two indole alkaloid sulfonic acids, were isolated from an aqueous extract of the 
 <italic>Isatis indigotica</italic> root. Compounds 
 <bold>36</bold> and 
 <bold>37</bold> showed antiviral activities against the H3N2 influenza virus with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 33.3 and 33.3 μM, respectively, and the coxsackievirus B3.
 <xref rid="cit0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> Three glycosidic bisindole alkaloids, isatindigobisindoloside B (
 <bold>38</bold>), isatindigobisindoloside E (
 <bold>39</bold>), and isatindigobisindoloside F (
 <bold>40</bold>), were isolated from an aqueous extract of the 
 <italic>Isatis indigotica</italic> root. Compounds 
 <bold>38–40</bold> showed antiviral activities against both the H3N2 influenza virus and coxsackievirus B3.
 <xref rid="cit0054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> Five indole alkaloids, oxoglyantrypine (
 <bold>41</bold>), norquinadoline A (
 <bold>42</bold>), deoxynortryptoquivaline (
 <bold>43</bold>), deoxytryptoquivaline (
 <bold>44</bold>), and tryptoquivaline (
 <bold>45</bold>), were isolated from a culture of the mangrove-derived fungus 
 <italic>Cladosporium</italic> sp. PJX-41. Compounds 
 <bold>41–45</bold> exhibited significant activity against influenza virus A (H1N1), with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 85, 82, 87, 85, and 89 μM, respectively.
