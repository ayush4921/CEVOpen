 <italic>Sophora alopecuroides</italic> L. is a medicinal plant widely distributed in Western and Central Asia, especially in China. 
 <italic>Sophora alopecuroides</italic> L. has been used for decades to treat fever, bacterial infections, heart disease, rheumatism, and gastrointestinal diseases. Aloperine (
 <bold>1</bold>), a quinolizidine-type alkaloid, was first isolated from the seeds and leaves of 
 <italic>Sophora alopecuroides</italic> L. To evaluate the anti-HIV activity of aloperine, HIV-1 NL4-3 NanoLuc-sec virus infection of MT4 cells was performed in the presence of various concentrations of aloperine. Aloperine showed anti-HIV activity with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 1.75 ± 0.59 μM. BMS-806-resistant, Env-mediated cell-cell fusion, such as that mediated by YU2-T198P and 8x, may be inhibited by aloperine.
