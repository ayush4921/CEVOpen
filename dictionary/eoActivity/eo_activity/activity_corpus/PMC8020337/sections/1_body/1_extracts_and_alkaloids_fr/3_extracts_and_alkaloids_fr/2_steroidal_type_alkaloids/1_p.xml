 <italic>Solanum erianthum</italic> D. Don, a medicinally important plant of Solanaceae, contains steroidal alkaloids. The steroidal alkaloid glycoside solamargine (
 <bold>24</bold>) was isolated from the methanolic extract of the leaves of 
 <italic>Solanum erianthum</italic> D. Don. Compound 
 <bold>24</bold> demonstrated strong inhibition of the DNA replication of HBV with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 2.17 μM, and also showed potent activity against HBsAg with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 1.57 μM. Compound 
 <bold>24</bold> is a promising lead molecule in the search for drugs with multiple mechanisms for the treatment of HBV
