<p>Harmine (
 <bold>53</bold>) was isolated from 
 <italic>Peganum harmala, Banisteriopsis caapi</italic>, and 
 <italic>Passiflora incarnata</italic>. Compound 
 <bold>53</bold> exhibited activity against HSV-2 with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.1 μg/mL.
 <xref rid="cit0069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref> The combination of harmine with acyclovir showed a combination index of 0.5, which indicated that these two compounds have a synergic effect. This suggests that harmine may be used with acyclovir to improve the treatment of genital herpes in immunocompromised patients.
 <xref rid="cit0067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref> Harman (
 <bold>54</bold>) was isolated from 
 <italic>Simira eleiezeriana</italic> and 
 <italic>Simira glaziovii</italic> and was evaluated against HSV-1 and HSV-2. Harman showed good results with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 4.90 μM and a SI of 11.8 for HSV-1, and an EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 71.8 μM and SI of 24.7 for HSV-2.
 <xref rid="cit0070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref> Vincosamide (
 <bold>55</bold>) and strictosamide (
 <bold>56</bold>) belong to a class of indole alkaloids and were isolated from the root bark of 
 <italic>Nauclea latifolia</italic> Smith. Compounds 
 <bold>55</bold> and 
 <bold>56</bold> inhibited both acyclovir-sensitive and acyclovir-resistant HSV-2 strains.
 <xref rid="cit0071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref> Manzamine A (
 <bold>57</bold>) was isolated from the sponges 
 <italic>Pachypellina sp</italic>. and 
 <italic>Haliclona sp</italic>. and had an anti-HSV-2 activity with a minimal effective concentration of 0.05 μg/mL.
 <xref rid="cit0072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref> 17-nor-Excelsinidine (
 <bold>58</bold>), an akuammigine-type alkaloid, was identified from 
 <italic>A. scholaris</italic>. Compound 
 <bold>58</bold> was tested against HSV in an HSV-transfected Vero cell line, and against adenovirus in an adenovirus-transfected HepG-2 cell line, and showed higher activity than acyclovir, with EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 6.97 μg/mL against HSV and 3.32 μg/mL against adenovirus.
