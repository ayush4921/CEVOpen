<p>The antiviral effect of an ethanol extract of the roots and rhizomes of 
 <italic>Rheum palmatum</italic> (Polygonaceae family) against coxsackievirus B
 <sub>3</sub> (CVB
 <sub>3</sub>) was evaluated in tissue culture cells and a mouse model. The ethanol extract from 
 <italic>R. palmatum</italic> showed significant inhibitory activity against CVB
 <sub>3</sub>-infected HEP-2 cells when added after infection. The serum of mice still contained the pharmaceutical compound 24 h after intraperitoneal injection, and the extract exhibited an antiviral effect on CVB
 <sub>3</sub>-infected cells. The ethanol extract-treated mice showed alleviated clinical signs, a better survival rate, and a higher maximum tolerated dose along with decreased viral titers compared with the virus control group. These results indicated that the ethanol extract from 
 <italic>R. palmatum</italic> had anti-CVB
 <sub>3</sub> activity in vitro and in vivo
