<p>Myrioneuron alkaloids are a family of nitrogen-containing polycyclic compounds produced by plants of the genus Myrioneuron R. Br. (Rubiaceae). Two pairs of enantiomers, cluster A (
 <bold>28</bold>) and cluster B (
 <bold>29</bold>), as well as the cluster A derivative (±)-13α-methoxymyrifabral A (
 <bold>30</bold>) were isolated from the aerial parts of 
 <italic>Myrioneuron faberi</italic>. Cluster A (
 <bold>28</bold>) and cluster B (
 <bold>29</bold>) possess a cyclohexane-fused octahydroquinolizine skeleton. Compounds 
 <bold>28–30</bold> inhibited replication of HCV with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 4.7, 2.2, and 0.9 μM, respectively, and exhibited less cytotoxicity against liver cells than the positive control telaprevir (VX-950).
 <xref rid="cit0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Aloperine (
 <bold>1</bold>), a quinolizidine alkaloid with an unusual endocyclic ring system, was extracted from 
 <italic>Sophora alopecuroides</italic>. Aloperine has been identified as a potent HCV inhibitor with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 4.23 ± 0.99 μM. 12
 <italic>N</italic>-4′-Methylpiperazine-1′-sulfonyl aloperine (
 <bold>31</bold>), based on aloperine as the lead compound, was synthesized and evaluated for its anti-HCV activity. Compound 
 <bold>31</bold> exhibited moderate potency with EC
 <sub>50</sub> values in the micromolar range against both wild-type and direct-acting antiviral agent (DAA)-resistant variants, and synergistically inhibited HCV replication in conjunction with approved DAAs. Furthermore, compound 
 <bold>31</bold> also had a good oral pharmacokinetic and safety profile.
