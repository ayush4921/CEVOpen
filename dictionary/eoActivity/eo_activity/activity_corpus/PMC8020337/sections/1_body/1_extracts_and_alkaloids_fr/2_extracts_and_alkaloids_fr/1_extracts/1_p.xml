 <italic>Panax ginseng</italic> Meyer (Korean Red Ginseng, KRG) belongs to the family Araliaceae. Korean ginseng has shown therapeutic efficacy toward various diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and atherosclerosis. A recent study has suggested that oral KRG can prolong survival in HIV-1 patients, possibly by slowing the decrease in CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T-cell counts.
 <xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Two herbal decoctions (
 <italic>Betula alba</italic> and 
 <italic>Sutherlandia frutescens</italic>) have interesting immunostimulatory and antimicrobial properties and hence could be useful in the management of HIV/AIDS and associated opportunistic infections.
 <xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Chloroform and methanol extracts from the roots of 
 <italic>Aerva lanata</italic> (Amaranthaceae family) showed inhibition of recombinant HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) (91% and 89%, respectively) at 1 mg/mL.
 <xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The findings of another study showed that co-administration of 
 <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> Lam. (Moringaceae family) leaf powder at traditionally used doses had no clinically significant effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of nevirapine in HIV-infected adults.
 <xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> In another study, 
 <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> Lam. leaf extracts showed potent and selective inhibition of the early stages in HIV-1 infectivity and this study partly explained the benefits and improvement in the quality of life claimed by people living with HIV/AIDS who use this medicinal plant as a supplement.
 <xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Aqueous and 50% ethanolic extracts prepared from the stem bark of 
 <italic>Acacia catechu</italic> (Mimosa family) exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of HIV-1
 <sub>NL4.3</sub> at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10 μg/mL mediated by the inhibition of the functions of the viral protein and Tat.
 <xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
 <italic>Phyllanthus emblica</italic> (Euphorbiaceae family) fruit extracts have been found to exert their anti-HIV activity via inhibition of HIV RT activity.
 <xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The dried leaves of 
 <italic>Sutherlandia frutescens</italic> (L.) R. Br. (Fabaceae family) did not change the HIV viral load, and the CD4 T-lymphocyte counts were similar in the two arms of a clinical study at 24 weeks.
 <xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> A pine cone extract from 
 <italic>Pinus yunnanensis</italic> Franch (Pinaceae family) had potent inhibitory activities against HIV-1
 <sub>IIIB</sub>, HIV-1
 <sub>RF</sub>, RT inhibitor-resistant strains HIV-1
 <sub>A17</sub> and HIV-1
 <sub>AO18</sub>, and HIV-2
 <sub>ROD</sub>, and the anti-HIV mechanisms included inhibition of HIV entry and inhibition of reverse transcriptase activity.
 <xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The aqueous extract from the whole plants of 
 <italic>Alepidea amatymbica</italic> (Umbelliferae family) showed significant selective anti-HIV activity and was found to be non-toxic as judged by observing the cell density and morphology.
 <xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> A 
 <italic>Plectranthus barbatus</italic> Andr (Labiatae family) leaf extract inhibited HIV-1 PR with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 62.0 μg/mL and showed poor inhibition of HIV-1 RT.
 <xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> A water extract from the stem of 
 <italic>Sanguisorba officinalis</italic> (SOE, Rosaceae family) has anti-HIV-1 properties. SOE acted directly on HIV-1, instead of the cellular receptors or coreceptors, and exhibited potency against replication-competent HIV-1 strains resistant to specific drugs targeting protease and RT activities.
 <xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Two members of the Magnoliaceae family, 
 <italic>Schisandra rubriflora</italic> and 
 <italic>Schisandra chinensis</italic> (Turcz.) Baill., have anti-HIV-1 activity. A 70% aqueous acetone extract of 
 <italic>Schisandra rubriflora</italic> fruits showed inhibitory activity on HIV-1
 <sub>IIIB</sub> -induced syncytium formation.
 <xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The petroleum ether and ethyl acetate extracts of the fruits of 
 <italic>Schisandra chinensis</italic> (Turcz.) Baill. had effects against HIV-1 RT and viral replication.
 <xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The water extract of the stem of 
 <italic>Ephedra sinica</italic> Stapf (Ephedraceae family) could induce the replication of latent HIV-1 infected-U1 cells in vitro through NF-κB activation
