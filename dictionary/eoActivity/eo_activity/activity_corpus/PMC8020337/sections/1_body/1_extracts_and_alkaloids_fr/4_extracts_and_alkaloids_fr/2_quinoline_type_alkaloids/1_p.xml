 <italic>Ruta graveolens</italic> L., belonging to the Rutaceae family, is a medicinal plant widely used in the Mediterranean region to treat pain, dermatitis, rheumatism, and other inflammatory diseases. Pseudane IX (
 <bold>25</bold>), arborinine (
 <bold>26</bold>), and kokusaginine (
 <bold>27</bold>) were isolated from the leaves of 
 <italic>Ruta angustifolia</italic>. Pseudane IX showed strong anti-HCV activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 1.4 ± 0.2 μM without apparent cytotoxicity. The anti-HCV activity of pseudane IX was stronger than that of ribavirin (2.8 ± 0.4 μM), which has been widely used for the treatment of HCV infections. Mode-of-action analyses revealed that pseudane IX inhibited HCV at the post-entry step and decreased the levels of HCV RNA replication and viral protein synthesis. Compounds 
 <bold>26</bold> and 
 <bold>27</bold> also possessed moderate anti-HCV activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 6.4 ± 0.7 and 6.4 ± 1.6 μM, respectively.
