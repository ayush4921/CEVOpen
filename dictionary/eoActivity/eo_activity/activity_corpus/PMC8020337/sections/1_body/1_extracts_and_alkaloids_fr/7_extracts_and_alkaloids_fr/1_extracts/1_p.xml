 <italic>Mallotus peltatus</italic> (Geist.) Mur. Arg belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae. A methanolic crude extract of 
 <italic>Mallotus peltatus</italic> leaves possessed weak anti-herpes simplex virus (HSV) activity. Conversely, an active fraction A exhibited potent anti-HSV activity against both HSV-1 (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 7.8 μg/mL) and HSV-2 (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 8.2 μg/mL), probably by inhibiting the early stage of multiplication.
 <xref rid="cit0060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> The red marine alga 
 <italic>Osmundaria obtusiloba</italic> (C. Agardh) R. E. Norris treated with acetone had potent antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2 and showed low toxicity toward cell cultures. Although acyclovir has better activity than the algal extract, inhibitors that impact the different steps of viral infection are desirable because they may allow more efficient treatment and prevent the emergence of resistant strains.

 <italic>Phyllanthus urinaria</italic> linnea (Euphorbiaceae family) is a traditional medicinal plant used to treat various diseases. An acetone extract of the whole plant of 
 <italic>P. urinaria</italic> inhibited HSV-2 infection, but not HSV-1 infection. As an entry inhibitor against HSV-2, this extract could potentially be investigated for combinatorial drug treatment with nucleoside analogs, such as ACV, for the therapeutic management of HSV-2 infections.
 <xref rid="cit0062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> A 
 <italic>Camellia sinesis</italic> (Theaceae family) aqueous extract of the whole plant was tested for antiviral activity against HSV. The results showed that HSV-1 multiplication was inhibited at 1 and 2 h after treatment and was decreased at 3 h. An aqueous extract of the whole plant of 
 <italic>E. amoenum</italic>, which belongs to the family Boraginaceae, had a low antiherpes effect at 2 h after treatment, which was similar to the antiviral properties of 
 <italic>C. sinesis</italic> at 3 h. 
 <italic>C. sinesis</italic> and 
 <italic>E. amoenum</italic> extracts showed the best antiherpes effect when used 1 h after virus inoculation.
 <xref rid="cit0063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> An aqueous extract of 
 <italic>Melissa officinalis</italic> Linn (Labiatae family) was examined for its antiviral activity against acyclovir-sensitive HSV-1 and clinical isolates of acyclovir-resistant strains in vitro. The 
 <italic>Melissa</italic> extract interacted directly with free viral particles of two acyclovir-resistant HSV strains with low IC
 <sub>50</sub> values and high selectivity indices (SI). The 
 <italic>Melissa</italic> extract inhibited HSV-1 attachment to host cells in a dose-dependent manner for acyclovir-sensitive and acyclovir-resistant strains.

 <xref rid="cit0065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref> The whole plant of two Phyllanthus family members, 
 <italic>Phyllanthus urinaria</italic> and 
 <italic>Phyllanthus watsonii</italic>, demonstrated strong antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2 with an SI &gt;33.6. Time-of-addition studies suggested that the extract may act against both the early infection and replication stages. Protein expression studies indicated that 
 <italic>P. urinaria</italic> demonstrated potent inhibitory activity against HSV.

 <italic>Peganum harmala</italic> (Zygophyllaceae family) was investigated for its HSV-2 activity and organic extracts of the different plant organs were evaluated for their cytotoxicity toward Vero cells by the MTT test and anti-HSV-2 activity by a plaque reduction assay. Only the methanol seed extract was active with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 13.2 μg/mL and SI of 161. Additionally, a study of the antiviral mode of action revealed that this extract exerted a virucidal action during both the viral entry and the release of the newly formed virions; however, no cell protection was observed
