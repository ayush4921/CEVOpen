<p>Orchidaceae is among the richest plant families, with more than 25,000 species worldwide. 
 <italic>Serapias</italic> L. is a genus of the Orchidaceae family which occurs from the eastern–central and eastern Mediterranean to the western Transcaucasusand is represented by 30 common taxa [1–3]. There are 23 species of Orchidaceae and 30 of the 170 endemic taxa growing in Turkey [2,3]. Some of the Orchidaceae species have been used as herbal medicines to treat headaches, dizziness, tetanus, and epilepsy. Some orchid species have been shown to exert sedative, anticonvulsive, and antiepileptic effects, as listed in the oldest Chinese materia medica [4,5]. In recent years, the neuroprotective functions of some Orchidaceae species are one of their traditional uses [6]. It is also used in perfumes, cosmetics, and aromatherapy. The orchids used in sahlep production are usually adapted to terrestrial and mild climate regions. Sahlep is generally used as a traditional beverage or food additive. Its use is very common as a hot drink in Turkey, the Middle East, and Balkan countries during the wintertime [7,8]. Sahlep consumed as a drink is prepared by adding milk to sahlep powder and sugar [9]. Sahlep is also used as a stabilizer to produce Kahramanmaraş-type ice cream in Turkey [10]. In the literature, the protein contents of orchids are mentioned to be in the range of 3.11%–4.95% [11]; thus, it is considered as a valuable food source. It has been reported that, depending on the species used, sahlep contains 17.7%–54.6% of glucomannan, 5.44%–38.7% of starch, and 0.5%–1% of nitrogenous substances based on dry material; the proportion of glucomannan was found to be higher than that of the starch of other orchid species.Glucomannans are carbohydrate polymers consisting of 1,4- 
 <italic>β</italic> -D-mannose and 1,4- 
 <italic>β</italic> -D-glucose units [12].Glucomannan is soluble fiber which delays gastric emptying time and provides a feeling of fullness, thus playing a role in appetite control. It is used as a natural laxative as it can increase stool volume without damaging the colonic microecology [13,14]. Studies show that it regulates intestinal microbiota and reduces the risk of colorectal cancer [14,15]. In addition, it ensures the removal of bile acids by feces. This situation can be evaluated as cholesterol excretion. Studies support the claim that glucomannan lowers blood cholesterol level [16]. Clinical trials of glucomannans used 3 g/day [17]. It is known that supplementary food products containing glucomannan can help control weight and fight the urge to overeat. Thus,
