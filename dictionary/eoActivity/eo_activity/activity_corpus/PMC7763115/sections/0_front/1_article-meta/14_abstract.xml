 <p>The volatile components of essential oil (EO), SPME, and SPME of solvent extracts ( 
  <italic>n</italic> -hexane, methanol, and water) obtained from fresh 
  <italic>Serapias orientalis</italic> subsp. 
  <italic>orientalis</italic> ( 
  <italic>Soo</italic> ) were analyzed by GC-FID/MS. EO of 
  <italic>Soo</italic> gave 11 compounds in the percentage of 99.97%; capronaldehyde (37.01%), 2-( 
  <italic>E</italic> )-hexenal (23.19%), and 
  <italic>n</italic> -nonanal (19.05%) were found to be major constituents. SPME GC-FID/MS analyses of fresh plant and solvent extracts of 
  <italic>Soo</italic> revealed 7, 12, 7, and 4 compounds within the range of 99.7% to 99.9%. Limonene (76.5%, 41.7%, and 61.3%) was the major compound in SPMEs of the 
  <italic>n</italic> -hexane and methanol extracts. 
  <italic>α</italic> -Methoxy- 
  <italic>p</italic> -cresol (52.9%) was the main component in its water extract. The antimicrobial activity of EO and the solvent extracts of 
  <italic>Soo</italic> were screened against 9microorganisms. EO showed the best activity against 
  <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> , with 79.5 µg/mL MIC value. The 
  <italic>n</italic> -hexane, methanol, and water extracts were the most active against the 
  <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> within the range of 81.25–125.0 µg/mL (MIC). IC 
  <sub>50</sub> values for the lipase enzyme inhibitory activity of EO and solvent extracts ( 
  <italic>n</italic> -hexane, methanol, and water) were determined to be 59.87 µg/mL, 64.03 µg/mL, 101.91 µg/mL, and 121.24 µg/mL, respectively.
