<p>It is a general agreement that only acids with even number of carbons occur naturally, but it was found that tobacco seed oil contained little amounts of nonadecylic acid (0.07%) and margaric acid (0.09%) containing odd number (19 and 17, respectively) of carbon atoms. According to the results shown in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, fatty acids are the most dominant in tobacco seed oil. Mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids' domination was strongly influenced by the higher content of oleic (
 <italic>ω</italic>-9) and linoleic acids, which totally constituted 85.5%. In the case of saturated fatty acids, palmitic and stearic acids were the most dominant in tobacco oil (11.7%). Due to the high content of unsaturated fatty acids, tobacco oil has antioxidant, antiviral, immune-simulating and wound healing activities. Linoleic acid is an essential fatty acid which cannot be synthesized in human body. It is the most prevalent polyunsaturated fatty acid in all of the vegetable oils, with the highest level observed in tobacco seed oil. The linoleic acid in tobacco seed oil is about 1.5 times higher than that in soybean oil (42–53%), while olive oil has less than 5% of linoleic acid. The very high level of linoleic acid showed the potential for tobacco oil to be a potential dietary source of essential fatty acids. Oleic acid, which is the major fatty acid in olive oil (&gt;80%), is believed to lower the incidence of cardiovascular disease [
