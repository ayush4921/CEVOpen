<p>The highest level for 
 <italic>α</italic>-tocopherol was recorded in tobacco seed oil (4.8 mg/kg oil). It also contained the highest level of 
 <italic>γ</italic>-tocopherol (88.3 mg/kg oil). Tested oil also had the highest total tocopherol content (217.7 
 <italic>μ</italic>mol/kg oil). Total tocopherol is reported in 
 <italic>μ</italic>mol/kg due to the different molecular weights of 
 <italic>α</italic>- and 
 <italic>γ</italic>-tocopherol isomers. Previous research on different Bulgarian and U.S.A. tobacco varieties showed a wide range of total tocopherol content (11.2–166.9 
 <italic>μ</italic>mol/kg) [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] The tocopherol values of Kazakhstan tobacco varieties in the present work were comparable to those of Bulgarian tobacco varieties, grapeseed (37.1–263.4 
 <italic>μ</italic>mol/kg) and palm (9.3–1478.2 
 <italic>μ</italic>mol/kg) oils, but lower than those of soybean oil (234.5–6353.9 
 <italic>μ</italic>mol/kg) and some varieties of the olive oil (95–755 
 <italic>μ</italic>mol/kg). Although different in total tocopherols, the tobacco seed oils had a similar ratio between their 
 <italic>α</italic>- and 
 <italic>γ</italic>-tocopherols.
