<p>The amounts of unsaturated and saturated fatty acids as reported in the present work are close to those reported by Giannelos et al. and Mukhtar et al. [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] (85.1% and 14.1%). However, the results of the present work differ from those of Zalatanov et al. [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] who have reported 73.9% of unsaturated and 26.1% of saturated fatty acids in tobacco seed oil. The slight difference in the amounts of different fatty acids as shown may be due to different species of tobacco (
 <italic>Nicotiana</italic>) used in the studies or due to different environmental or geographical conditions.
