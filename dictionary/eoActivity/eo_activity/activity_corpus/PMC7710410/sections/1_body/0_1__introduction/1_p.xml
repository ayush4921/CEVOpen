<p>Tobacco was once the currency of the Almaty region and supported southern Kazakhstan's economy. As opposed to most agricultural crops, since its earliest domestication, tobacco has been bred for leaf production and characteristics. Breeding has been selected against seed characteristics because plant energy directed to seed production detracts from leaf production. Recently, health concerns over smoking and chewing tobacco have reduced the overall demand for the crop. Between 2003 and 2009, the Southern Kazakhstan Agricultural Development Commission enacted a voluntary buy out for tobacco farmers to decrease dependency on tobacco farming, improve the diversity of farm economy, and preserve the region's farmland. Farmers in southern Kazakhstan are now turning to grow alternative crops or raise livestock in place of tobacco. However, new farm products are in need of large investment in facilities, training of staff, management, and marketing. Kazakhstan has a suitable climate for tobacco, and farmers have experienced full range of facilities for farming tobacco. Therefore, the best option for farmers may be development of a profitable alternative use of tobacco.</p>
