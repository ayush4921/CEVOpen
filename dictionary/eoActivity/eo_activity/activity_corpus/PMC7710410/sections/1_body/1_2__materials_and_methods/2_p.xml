 <italic>α</italic>, 
 <italic>γ</italic>, 
 <italic>δ</italic>-Tocopherols were purchased from EMD chemicals Inc. (San Diego, CA, U.S.A.). Ultrapure water was prepared by an ELGA Purelab ultra Genetic polishing system with &lt;5 ppb TOC and resistivity of 18.2 mg (Lowell, MA, U.S.A.) and was used for all experiments. All other chemicals and solvents were of the highest commercial grade and used without further purification. Sample preparation for gas chromatography was performed as follows: 0.01 g of sample was placed into test tube, and 1 сm
 <sup>3</sup> of 2% concentrated sulfuric acid solution in butanol was added. Tightly capped test tube was placed into a drying chamber at 105°С. Butylation was carried out for 30 minutes. Then, the test tube was chilled to room temperature, and 5 сm
 <sup>3</sup> hexane and 20 сm
 <sup>3</sup> distilled water were added. The sample mixture was shook vigorously and left until full-phase separation. After careful removal of 1 
 <italic>µ</italic>l aliquot of the hexane layer, it was injected into the gas chromatograph. Gas chromatography was performed on Shimadzu model GC2010PLUS gas chromatograph (Kyoto, Japan), equipped with flame ionization detector (FID) and fitted with a fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.25  mm i.d., 25 
 <italic>µ</italic>m, Supelco). Chromatograph conditions were as follows: initial column temperature 60°С programmed to increase up to 250°С. Hydrogen was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 43,3 ml/min. Quantification was based on the area under each fatty acid peak as compared to the total area of all fatty acid peaks.
