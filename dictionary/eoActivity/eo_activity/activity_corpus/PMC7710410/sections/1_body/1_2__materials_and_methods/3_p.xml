<p>Tocopherols were determined according to a reported protocol. The tobacco seed oil was dissolved in methyl-tert-butyl ether and filtered through a 0.45 
 <italic>μ</italic>m filter. The stationary phase was Waters C-30 column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>m). The mobile phase consisted of methanol/MTBE/water (81 : 15 : 4, v/v/v) (solvent A) and MTBE/methanol (91 : 9, v/v) (solvent B). The mobile phase was run from 0 to 16.7% solvent B in 15 min and 100% solvent B from 15 to 25 min and re-equilibrated with 100% solvent A from 25 to 30 min. The flow rate was 1 mL/min, and injection volume was 40 
 <italic>μ</italic>L. Tocopherol profile of each sample was detected at a wavelength of 295 nm and compared to known standards for quantification. All measurements were taken in triplicate.
