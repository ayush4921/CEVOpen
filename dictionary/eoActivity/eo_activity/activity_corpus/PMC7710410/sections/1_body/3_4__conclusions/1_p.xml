    <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The properties such as high unsaturated fatty acid content and low saturated fatty acid content of tobacco seed oil make it particularly suitable for the manufacture of new line of perfumes, and industrial salad dressings and can be used as an emulsifier in food processing and high penetration massage oil. Tobacco seed oil could be used as a solvent for its own flowers and selected for its scent. Its scent is sweet without being cloying, evocative of old-fashioned cottage gardens.
