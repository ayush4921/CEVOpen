<p>TC values remained constant for all elements with a slight increase in case of polluted samples (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-18-03904-f010">Figure 10</xref>). The TC values calculated for Cd, Ni, and Pb were below 1 for both experiments (AsCd and AsCdNiPb). For Cd, the transfer coefficient values in AsCd and AsCdNiPb experiments ranged between 0.2 and 0.48; for Pb, the TC values were between 0.10 and 0.43, and for Ni, the TC values varied between 0.17 and 0.53.
