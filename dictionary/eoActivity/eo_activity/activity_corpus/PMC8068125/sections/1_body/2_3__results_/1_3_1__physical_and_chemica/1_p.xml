<p>The results of physical–chemical parameters detected from the soil control showed a conductivity of 475 μS/cm, humus 9.3%, K 1872 mg/kg d.w. (dry weight), total nitrogen (N
 <sub>total</sub>) 1.20%, total phosphorus (P
 <sub>total</sub>) 4173 mg/kg d.w., total organic carbon (TOC
 <sub>total</sub>) 10%, and total carbon (C
 <sub>total</sub>) 23%. The pH value indicated a weak acid reaction of the soil. Due to nitrogen and phosphorus content, the soil was considered a clay soil that was rich in organic matter. The soil C/N ratio of 19.2 indicated rather mineralization than microbial immobilization, which means microbial activity in soil and the release of nitrogen, available for plant uptake.
