<p>The TF values calculated for root/leaves revealed Ni increased values for all experiments, the maximum TC value being 1.28 in the AsCd experiment. This TC value indicated the transfer of Ni from root to leaves, the average concentrations of 7 mg/kg were situated under a phytotoxic value of 30 mg/kg in plants. Moreover, differences between the pollutants combinations and control (M) were observed. Ni presented lower TF values in the AsCdNiPb experiment (in control range) as to the AsCd experiment. The TF value of Cd increased about 40% in June in the AsCdNiPb experiment in comparison to the same period in the AsCd experiment, but in July, the TF values decreased at 0.19 in both combinations, being in the control range.</p>
