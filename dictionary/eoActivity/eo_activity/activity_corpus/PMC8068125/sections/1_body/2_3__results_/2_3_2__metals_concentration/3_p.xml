<p>Generally, at the top soil layer, the metallic elements were found in high concentrations compared to the bottom soil layer for both experiments. Exceptions were observed in case of Ni and Pb with the same distribution between layers in the AsCd experiment similar to those detected in control sample (M). Ni and Pb were added in soil only in experiment AsCdNiPb (in mix with As and Cd). Similarly, these elements increase in the bottom soil layer at the final of test (July) in case of the AsCdNiPb experiment.</p>
