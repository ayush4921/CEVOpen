 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-18-03904-f004">Figure 4</xref> present the results of As, Cd, Ni, and Pb concentrations detected in the enriched soil from May to July. After one week of exposure, the contaminated soil samples from the experiments AsCd and AsCdNiPb showed significant metals content compared to the control (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), which was mainly due to metal soil enrichment. However, metal concentrations (As, Cd, Ni, Pb) were below the intervention threshold for sensitive use, so As and Cd content was above the alert threshold for both AsCd and AsCdNiPb experiments, respectively. In the case of the AsCdNiPb experiment, Ni and Pb concentrations slowly increased over the normal value. The metal concentration detected in the soil samples from May and July in case of the three experiments showed a correlation coefficient of 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.99, pointing out that the metals accumulation in soil has the same tendency.
