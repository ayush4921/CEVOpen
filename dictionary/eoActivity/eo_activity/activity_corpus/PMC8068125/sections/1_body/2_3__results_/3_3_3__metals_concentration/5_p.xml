<p>Slight modifications were observed in case of Ni (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-18-03904-f007">Figure 7</xref>) concentrations in the AsCd experiment compared to the control experiment (M). Additionally, Ni and Pb were added to the soil only in the AsCdNiPb experiment. Both metals Ni (19.52 mg/kg d.w) and Pb (11.88 mg/kg d.w), respectively, had maximum values in the mint root in July, exceeding the limit for the normal plant development (5 mg/kg d.w.). This observation was correlated with the same trend of Ni and Pb values detected in soil in July, where the highest concentrations of this metals were observed. Therefore, the results could be influenced by plant capacity to absorb and retain these metals in different developmental stages and the metalsâ€™ bioavailability.
