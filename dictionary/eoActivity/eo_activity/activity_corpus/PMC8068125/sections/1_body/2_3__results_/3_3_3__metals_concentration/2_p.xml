<p>The analysis of exposed mint plants showed the presence of toxic metals except for As. The value of As concentration detected in 
 <italic>Mentha piperita</italic> was below the quantification limit of the method in root, stem, and leaves for both experiments (AsCd and AsCdNiPb), although the As content (23.7 mg/kg d.w.) which was added in soil reached the threshold intervention value (25 mg/kg d.w.).
