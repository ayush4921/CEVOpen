<p>The studied metals were not efficiently translocated in aerial parts of plants. The TF values were below 1, indicating a non-efficient translocation of metals between organs (

This indicates the Ni utilization in plant nutrition. Cd translocation in stem was superior in the AsCdNiPb experiment as in case of the AsCd experiment, but it was not significant.
