<p>Comparing the same plant organ in the experiments, we observed very significant (

 <xref rid="ijerph-18-03904-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) at the root and stem level. There were no changes in Cd and Ni concentrations comparing the data obtained for AsCd and AsCdNiPb. The differences in Ni and Pb were due to the addition of this element in AsCdNiPb. No significant changes were observed for the leaves comparing all the experiment data.
