<p>Pb had a similar behavior as Cd and Ni, accumulating mostly in the root of the plant. Pb concentrations (0.2 to 1.35 mg/kg) in AsCd were similar with the ones detected in the control experiment (M) (0.4 to 2.13 mg/kg). The highest concentration was detected in the root samples in July for the AsCdNiPb experiment (11.88 mg/kg d.w.). The Pb concentrations were significantly different (
