<p>This study aimed to evaluate the effect of toxic metals Cd, Ni, Pb, and As on 
 <italic>Mentha piperita</italic> grown in an enriched soil in laboratory conditions by simulating a soil polluted by mining activities. The experiment was carried out over a period of three months, in order to assess the ability of 
 <italic>Mentha piperita</italic> to accumulate the metals from the soil and to transfer them from the roots to the aerial parts (stem, leaves).
