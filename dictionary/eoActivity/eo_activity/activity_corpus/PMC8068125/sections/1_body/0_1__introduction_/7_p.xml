<p>Another toxic metal is arsenic derived by industrial activities or from the use of fertilizers. As occurs most commonly in the environment in trivalent and pentavalent oxidation states, which are found in both organic and inorganic compounds. Arsenate (AsO
 <sub>4</sub>
 <sup>3−</sup>) and arsenite (AsO
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>3−</sup>) are the most soluble inorganic forms found in water and soil [

 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-18-03904" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The concentrations of different forms of arsenic in soil, as well as its mobility in the water–soil–plant system are affected by the physical, chemical, and biochemical properties of the soil such as redox potential, pH, texture, presence of changeable ions, biological activity, and organic matter content [
