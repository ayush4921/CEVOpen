<p>Heavy metals interact strongly with the soil matrix and may become mobile as a result of changing environmental conditions [

Considering the fact that the soil represents a living system consisting in various organisms including plants, an increase of contaminants can adversely affect the normal growth or development of plants and finally the safety of plant products. The plant are soil-dependent photosynthetic organisms, which have the ability to accumulate trace elements, especially heavy metals, due to their ability to tolerate potentially toxic ions in the environment [
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-18-03904" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Human and animal diets, as well as health care programs, are based on various vegetable foods and medicinal herbs, leading to the bio magnification process of some accumulative contaminants in the final trophic chain. From the ancient times and likewise nowadays, the medicinal plants are the primary source for prevention, improving of symptoms, and the treatment in various diseases. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 80% of the population living in the outlying areas use only herbs to treat multiple diseases [

When using herbs in the treatment of certain conditions, it should be noted that in addition to the pharmacological effect, they can be toxic if they contain toxic contaminants such as pesticides or heavy metals. It is considered that prolonged treatment with plants with a heavy metal content such as: lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), zinc (Zn), and nickel (Ni) above the maximum allowed limit can cause severe health problems, including dermatitis, poisoning, organ dysfunctions, cancer, mental retardation, damage to nervous system, anemia, etc. [
