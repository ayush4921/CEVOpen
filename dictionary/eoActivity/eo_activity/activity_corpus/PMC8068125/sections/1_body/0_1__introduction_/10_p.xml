<p>In mining areas, where surface mining is either in operation or closed, the amounts of toxic metals discharged into the environment can be dangerously elevated. Thus, by leaching the contaminated areas with rainwater, both surface waters and sediments can be polluted. As a result, aquatic and riparian flora could be affected. Dinu et al. reported concentrations of metals ranging between 5.5 and 121 mg As/kg; 1.2 and 11.4 mg Cd/kg; 26 and 610 mg Ni/kg; 50 and 888 mg Pb/kg in soil samples collected from an area situated in Romania [
