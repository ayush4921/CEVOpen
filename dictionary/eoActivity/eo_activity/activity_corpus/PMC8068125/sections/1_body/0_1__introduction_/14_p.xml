 <italic>Mentha piperita</italic> is part of the 
 <italic>Lamiaceae</italic> family along with other aromatic plants used in medicinal products, foods, drinks, teas, cosmetically products, etc. Several species of mint have been described, but not all of them have therapeutic properties. The mint species, which are recognized to have medicinal properties, are 
 <italic>Mentha aquatica</italic> (water mint), 
 <italic>Mentha viridis</italic> or 
 <italic>Mentha spicata</italic> (sweet mint), and a hybrid of the two species: 
 <italic>Mentha piperita</italic>. All species of mint develop very well in cool places, partially covered by the sun. The growth of the plant is very fast. The plant has a roots system from which appear stems up to 40â€“130 cm high. The plant is multiplied by cuttings or stolons. The stems are red-purple and very branched, and the leaves are elongated-oval in shape, light green in color, and have serrated edges. In Europe, peppermint came into medicinal use for nausea, vomiting, and gastrointestinal disorders in the mid-eighteenth century. Extracts from 
 <italic>Mentha piperita</italic> leaves have therapeutic efficiency in arsenic toxicity amelioration in Swiss Albino mice. It seems that this plant decreases the lipid peroxidation, scavenging free radicals, reducing genotoxicity, and exhibiting the hepatic effects caused by the arsenic contamination [
