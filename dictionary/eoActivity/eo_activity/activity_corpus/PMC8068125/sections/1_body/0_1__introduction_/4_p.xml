<p>Depending on their role in the organism body, heavy metals can be essential and non-essential. Essential metals or micronutrients, such as Cr, Co, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni, Fe, Se, and Zn are required for optimal functioning of biological and biochemical processes, including humans. Non-essential metals such as As, Cd, Hg, and Pb have no known biological function. Heavy metals are not biodegradable, which is why they can be toxic even at low concentrations, representing a serious threat to both the environment and human health [
