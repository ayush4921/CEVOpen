<p>The metal transfer from soil in mint plants was studied. The data showed that TC values remained constant for all metals being below 1 for both experiments (AsCd and AsCdNiPb). 
 <italic>Mentha piperita</italic> immobilized the metals in root, reducing their toxicity, thus developing a tolerant mechanism. A similar result was obtained for Cd (TF 0.61) in mint subjected to a combination of Cd, Ni, Cr, Pb, and Co. No correlation between TF values of Pb (TF 1.08) and Ni (TF 1.16) was identified, which was probably due to the difference between the substrate characteristics [
