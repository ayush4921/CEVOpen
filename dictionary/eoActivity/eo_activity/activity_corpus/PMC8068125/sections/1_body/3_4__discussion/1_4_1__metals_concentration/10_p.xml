<p>As a general observation, the studied metals were retained mostly in the root rather than the aerial parts. This fact can be explained by the ability of metals as cations (Cd

 <sup>2+</sup>, Pb
 <sup>2+</sup>) to attach to negative charge sites of root cell walls, thus restricting the transfer from the root to the aerial parts [
