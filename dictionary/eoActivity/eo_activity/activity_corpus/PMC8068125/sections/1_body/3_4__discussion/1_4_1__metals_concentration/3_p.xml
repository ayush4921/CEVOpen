<p>The plant samples showed different metal concentrations of Cd, Ni, and Pb, except for As. The values of As in 
 <italic>Mentha piperita</italic> grown in laboratory conditions were under detection limits in all plant samples. Some studies reported that the As bioavailable concentration from soil is lower than the total content because As tend to form stable compounds that are less bioavailable and depend on the soil–water–plant system [

Furthermore, the use of some inorganic (ferrous sulfate, lamination slags, iron-bearing additives, goethite, metallurgical byproducts, red mud, all based especially on Fe and Mg oxides) or organic biochar obtained from different vegetal, industrial, or municipal wastes) could reduce the mobility of arsenic in plants but induce the decreases of biomass development. Due to low availability in soil, As has been reported in plants in very small concentration of even less 10 μg/kg [
