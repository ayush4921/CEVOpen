<p>Cd concentration showed changes in the systems root–stem and root–leaves in both experiments. Cd accumulation decreases proportionally with Ni and Pb supplementation in the AsCdNiPb experiment. Similar results were obtained in other studies on 
 <italic>Mentha piperita</italic> where the Cd concentration decreased in plant organs when this element is combined with Pb or Cu, thus indicating a competition between these two metals at the root level [
