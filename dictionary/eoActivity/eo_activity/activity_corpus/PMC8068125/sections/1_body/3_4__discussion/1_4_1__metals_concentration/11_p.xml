<p>The experiments (M, AsCd, and AsCdNiPb) pointed out that the rank of metals accumulation in mint samples was as follows: root &gt; stem &gt; leaves. One exception was for Ni and Cd in June, where for all the experiments, the metal accumulation order was root &gt; leaves &gt; stem. The same results were obtained in other studies for
