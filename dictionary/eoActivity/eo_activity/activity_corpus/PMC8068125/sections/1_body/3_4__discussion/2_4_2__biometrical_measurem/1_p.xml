<p>Growth inhibition is one of the symptoms of metal toxicity. The measurements performed for the mint leaves collected after one month of exposure showed positive changes in biomass and foliar size compared to the control. We assume that the additions of metals could stimulate the plant growth in case of the AsCd experiment and did not have visible effects in case of the AsCdNiPb experiment after one month of exposure. The same observations on plant growth were made in previous studies on 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> L. plants grown in a mining-contaminated soil. The presence of metals in different concentrations for a limited exposure time could influence plant development, these being involved in plant metabolic processes. Moreover, the plants could adopt particular survival strategies including a metal detoxification process or could favor the absorption of some metals to the detriment of others, the toxic metals being in competitions with essential metals or other nutrients [
