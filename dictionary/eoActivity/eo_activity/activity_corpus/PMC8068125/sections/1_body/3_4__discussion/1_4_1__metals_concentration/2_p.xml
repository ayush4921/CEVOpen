<p>Our results of metals concentration in plant samples were compared with the literature limits. The concentrations of studied metals specified in the literature in plants were As 0.01 to 0.06 mg/kg [
 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-18-03904" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], Cd less than 0.1 to 1 mg/kg, Ni from 0.1 to 5 mg/kg [
 <xref rid="B52-ijerph-18-03904" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], and Pb from 1 to 5 mg/kg [
 <xref rid="B43-ijerph-18-03904" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The concentrations that could induce phytotoxic effects in plants are As 2 mg/kg, Cd 10 mg/kg, Ni 30 mg/kg [
 <xref rid="B53-ijerph-18-03904" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], and Pb 20 mg/kg [
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-18-03904" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Moreover, WHO established the maximum permissible limits in food plants as follows: As 1 mg/kg, Cd 0.03 mg/kg, and Pb 10 mg/kg [
