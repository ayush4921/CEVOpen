<p>The metals transfer inside of roots generally occurs through passive diffusion at the cell membrane level or throughout active transfer based on the gradient of concentrations. The active transfer is a natural plant-specific process used for the absorption of essential elements. In addition, it represents the pathway of other toxic available elements. To tolerate the non-essential elements, the plants use different strategies such as morphological, physiological, biochemical, and genetic processes [
