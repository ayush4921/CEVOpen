<p>The transfer coefficients of metals (Cd, Ni, Pb) from the soil to the plant root were below 1 for both AsCd and AsCdNiPb experiments, respectively. TC values for Cd ranged between 0.2 and 0.48, for Pb 0.10 รท 0.43, and for Ni 0.17 รท 0.53. 
 <italic>Mentha piperita</italic> immobilized the metals (case of Cd, Ni, Pb) in roots, reducing their toxicity, developing a tolerant mechanism, or excluding the metal absorption by root (in case of Pb, As).
