<p>The studied metals were not efficiently translocated in the aerial parts of plants. The translocation factors were below 1, indicating a weak translocation of metals between vegetative organs. Cd and Pb were accumulated mainly in the root. Furthermore, it was observed that Ni was the only element of the four studied metals in which the transfer occurred from the root to the leaves based on their physiological implication. Our results confirmed that 
 <italic>Mentha piperita</italic> acts as a metal phytostabilizer at the root level and is a metal-tolerant plant if it uses a substrate with the described characteristics and the exposure period is no longer than one month. The long time exposure of mint plants to metals induces visible phytotoxic effects as a result of root development reduction.
