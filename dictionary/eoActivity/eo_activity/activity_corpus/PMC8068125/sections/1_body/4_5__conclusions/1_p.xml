<p>The present study showed the behavior of one important medicinal plant (
 <italic>Mentha piperita)</italic> in the presence of several metals (Cd, Ni, Pb, and As) and their capacity to transfer metals to the aerial parts. The laboratory experiments focused on the behavior of mint plants exposed to metals combination, such as AsCd and AsCdNiPb. After three months of exposure, the metals were found in the plants organs as follows: Cd &gt; Ni &gt; Pb &gt; As. In addition, the order of metal accumulation in plant organs was root &gt; stem &gt; leaves.
