<p>The harvested mint plants used for metal detection were washed firstly with tap water and secondly with distilled water. The plants were separated on roots, leaves, and stems and dried using a Lyophilizer Christ Alpha 1-2 LD (Martin Christ GmbH, Osterode, Germany) at −55 °C. After the drying procedure, the mint samples were thinly milled. About 0.2 to 0.5 g was weighed for metal content analysis. The mint samples were processed with 10 mL of HNO
 <sub>3</sub> and 3 mL of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> for 24 h at room temperature in order to mineralize organic matter (cold mineralization). The final mineralization at 180 °C (1800 W) for 15 min was performed using a Milestone Ethos Up microwave digester (Sorisole, Italy). The extract was filled up to a 25 mL volumetric flask, and the metal concentration was detected.
