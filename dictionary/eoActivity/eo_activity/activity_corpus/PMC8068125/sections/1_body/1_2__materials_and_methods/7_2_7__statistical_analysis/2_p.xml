<p>The interpretation of the obtained experimental data was performed using ANOVA ONE-WAY, depending on the value of 
 <italic>p</italic> obtained. The value of 
 <italic>p</italic> was considered insignificant for 
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05 (ns), significant for 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 (*), and very significant for 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 (**). Thus, the experimental data obtained for the soil depth (0–6 cm and 6–12 cm) and for each organ of the plant separately (stem–root, root–leaf, stem–leaf) were interpreted. The interpretation of the data was performed for the control samples as well as for the contaminated samples.
