<p>The metals (Cd, Ni, Pb, As) content was monthly detected both from soil (control soil/polluted soil) and plants (control/exposed plants), respectively. The soil samples for metal content detection were collected from two depths as follows: 0–6 cm and 6–12 cm. The depths were in accordance with the elongation of the peppermint plant roots. Up to 12 cm, the root maturation zone starts to develop; around this depth, the primary roots acquire lateral or hair roots.</p>
