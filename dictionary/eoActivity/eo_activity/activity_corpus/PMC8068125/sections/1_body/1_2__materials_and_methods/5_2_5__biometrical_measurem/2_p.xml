<p>The chlorophyll pigments (chlorophyll 
 <italic>a</italic> and chlorophyll 
 <italic>b</italic>) of mint samples were analyzed considering the methods described in Lichtenthaler and Buschmann [
 <xref rid="B48-ijerph-18-03904" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], and Krishnan et al. [
 <xref rid="B49-ijerph-18-03904" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The chlorophyll from the leaves samples was extracted in 80% acetone at 1:2.5 [
 <italic>mass (g)</italic>/
 <italic>volume(mL)]</italic> ratio. The leaves were cut into 1–2 cm pieces and homogenized. The leaves tissues were incubated in 80% buffered acetone on a mixing tube revolver Rotator D6050 (neoLabLine, Heidelgerg, Germany) for 12 h at 4 °C.
