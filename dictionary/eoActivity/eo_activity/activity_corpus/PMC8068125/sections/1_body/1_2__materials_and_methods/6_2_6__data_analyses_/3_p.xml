<p>To evaluate the plantsâ€™ ability to accumulate metals from soil and to transfer them from the root to the aerial parts (stem, leaves), the transfer coefficient (TC) or bioaccumulation factor (BCF) and the translocation factor (TF) were calculated. The TC factor was defined as the ratio between the metal concentration in the roots and its content in the soil (results express in mg/kg) [
