<p>To reach the intervention threshold values for sensitive soils according to the Romanian legislation MAPPM (1997) for analyzed elements (As, Cd, Ni, Pb), the soils were spiked with different solutions. Three different experiments were noted as 
 <italic>M</italic> (the control soil with no metals addition); 
 <italic>AsCd</italic> (polluted soil with 23.7 mg/kg As and 5 mg/kg Cd); and 
 <italic>AsCdNiPb</italic> (polluted soil with 23.7 mg/kg As, 5 mg/kg Cd, 136 mg/kg Ni and 95 mg/kg Pb).
