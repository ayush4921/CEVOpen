<p>The results represented the average of the two separate experiments. The samples collected from each experiment were analyzed for metal detection as follows: in three replicates for soil and two replicates for plants. In addition, two replicates were performed for chlorophyll detection. The quantities of plants samples obtained after the drying process were in some cases not sufficient for three replicates.</p>
