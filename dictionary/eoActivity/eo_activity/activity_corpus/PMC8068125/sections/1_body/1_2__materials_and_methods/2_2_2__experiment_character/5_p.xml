<p>The batch of experiments was performed in a laboratory using an acclimatization system (23 ± 2 °C) under natural light (12 h per day and night, day light intensity was 421 to 2411 lux) and relative humidity of about 23%. The pots were rotated and were mixed with a weekly frequency. To prevent the leakage of nutrients and metals from the substrate, plastic trays were used under each pot. The exposure period was about three months (May, June, and July). The plants were soaked with free chlorine tap water. An initial characterization of water before use was done. The watering was performed about three times per week in order to ensure a constant soil humidity for about 60% of the maximum moisture holding capacity of used soil.</p>
