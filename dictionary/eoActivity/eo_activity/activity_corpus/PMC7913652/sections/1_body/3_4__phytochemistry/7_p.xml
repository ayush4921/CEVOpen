<p>Surinamensin is a natural neolignan isolated from the leaves of 
 <italic>V. surinamensis</italic>, whose activity against 
 <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> amastigotes and promastigotes was tested in vitro based on its anti-schistosomal activity [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-00792" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Steroids, lignans, flavonoids, and polyketides were also isolated from 
 <italic>V. surinamensis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-00792" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The results revealed that surinamensin is active against 
 <italic>L. donovani</italic> promastigotes but showed no selective toxicity when tested against the amastigotes in the mouse peritoneal macrophage model [

 <italic>O</italic>.4′-neolignan 3,4,5-trimethoxy-8[3′,5′-dimethoxy-4′-propenylphenoxy]-phenylpropane was isolated from 
 <italic>Virola pavonis</italic>, and it showed in vitro anti-
 <italic>L. donovani</italic> promastigote activity at 100 μM in an assay using extracellular promastigotes [
