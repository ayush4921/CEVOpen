<p>The chemical characterization of a stem bark hydroethanolic extract of 
 <italic>Virola elongata</italic> revealed a content of 14.6% phenolic compounds (around 50% are flavonoids), among which are known antiulcer phenolic compounds, such as gallic acid, catechin, and rutin [

 <italic>V. elongata</italic> (also known as V. cuspidata) contains the natural resveratrol analog (
 <italic>Z</italic>)-3,5,4′-trimethoxystilbene, which completely abrogated Caco-2 cell growth at 0.4 µM, while an 80% cell growth inhibition was observed at 0.3 µM (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 0.25 µM). Analysis of its mechanisms of action indicated a blockage of the G2/M phase and the inhibition of tubulin’s polymerization, which plays a key role in neoplastic disease development [

 <italic>E</italic>)-3,5,4′-trihydroxystilbene (resveratrol) also showed a 70% inhibition of Caco-2 cell growth but at a higher concentration of 25 µM, which means that (
 <italic>Z</italic>)-3,5,4′-trihydroxystilbene is 100-fold more active than resveratrol [

 <italic>β</italic>-carbolines 6-methoxyharmalan and 6-methoxyharman, which have been suggested to possess some psychoactive effects, have also been isolated from 
 <italic>V. elongata</italic> [
