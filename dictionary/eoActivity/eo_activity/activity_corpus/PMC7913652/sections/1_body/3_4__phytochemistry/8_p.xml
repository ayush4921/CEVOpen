<p>The neolignan grandisin was identified in 
 <italic>V. surinamensis</italic> as well as in several Brazilian plant species used in popular medicine for the treatment of colic, inflammation, rheumatism, dyspepsia, and liver dysfunction. The antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory properties of grandisin have been investigated [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-00792" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Treatment with grandisin (1, 3, and 10 mg/kg) dose-dependently reduced the number of acetic acid-induced abdominal writhes in mice, similarly to indomethacin at the highest dose used. Furthermore, the data indicated that the antinociceptive activity of grandisin is not dependent on motor incoordination or sedation due to the depressant effect in the CNS. The further evaluation of grandisinâ€™s antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities in rodent models using the formalin test (a 60.5% reduction in paw licking time only in the inflammatory phase response), the croton oil-induced ear edema test (a 36.4% edema reduction at 10 mg/kg), and the carrageenan-induced peritonitis test (no effect at the concentrations tested) suggested that the mechanism of action of grandisin is not associated with the inhibition of events in the late stage of the inflammatory process, in which chemotaxis and cell migration occur. Instead, grandisin is hypothesized to reduce prostaglandin formation and/or activity through the inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity or prostaglandin receptor antagonist action. These results support the traditional use of grandisin-rich plants, such as 
 <italic>V. surinamensis</italic>, in the treatment of symptoms caused by an inflammatory process such as pain and edema [
