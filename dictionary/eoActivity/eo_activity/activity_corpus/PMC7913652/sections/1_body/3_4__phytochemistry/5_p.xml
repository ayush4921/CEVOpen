 <italic>V. venosa</italic>’s blooms, fruits, and seeds contain flavonoids, lignans, arylalkanones, and sitosterol, while alkaloids and stilbenes are present in the leaves and roots [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-26-00792" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Arylalkanones or acylarylrecorcinols have been found not only in 
 <italic>V. venosa</italic> (both fruits and bark) but also in 
 <italic>V. elongata</italic>, 
 <italic>V. surinamensis</italic>, and 
 <italic>V. sebifera</italic> [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-26-00792" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Research investigating the α-glucosidase inhibitory activity of 
 <italic>V. venosa</italic> and its bioactive compounds revealed that the methanolic extracts of the bark and leaf had a high content of phenolic compounds, demonstrating a high activity in antioxidant and α-glucosidase-inhibitory tests. These results are therapeutically relevant since inhibitors of α-glucosidase are potential compounds for the treatment of diabetes because they reduce diet-induced hyperglycemia by inhibiting this intestinal enzyme [

 <italic>V venosa</italic> methanolic bark and leaf extracts showed the presence of phenolic acids (ferulic acid, gallic acid, and 
 <italic>ρ</italic>-coumaric acid) and flavonoids (quercetin, quercetrin, kaempferol, and catechin), and identified ferulic acid as the main bioactive compound for the antioxidant and α-glucosidase-inhibitory activities [
