<p>The essential oil obtained from adult and plantlet leaves of 
 <italic>V. surinamensis</italic> has also been analyzed by GC–MS, and 11 monoterpenes, 11 sesquiterpenes, and three phenylpropanoids were identified. The plantlet essential oil caused 100% growth inhibition after 48 h in the development of the young trophozoite to the schizont stage, and the sesquiterpene nerolidol was identified as one of the active constituents, indicating a potential antimalarial use [
