 <italic>V. surinamensis</italic> is widely used by the riverside inhabitants of the floodplain forest of the Mazagão River in the Brazilian Amazon to treat different disorders [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-26-00792" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In particular, 
 <italic>V. surinamensis</italic> seed oil is used topically for inflammatory skin conditions and as a preventive for microbial infections during wound healing. The oil is also used as a repellent. Leaf and bark decoctions are used as oral preparations for the treatment of inflammation in the digestive, urinary, and reproductive systems. Bark and fruit decoctions are used for intestinal infections, while exudate poultices are applied topically for furunculosis [

 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-00792" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Accordingly, the ethanolic extract (EE) of 
 <italic>V. surinamensis</italic> resin has demonstrated preventive activity in rodent models of gastric mucosal disease [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-00792" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Pre-treatment with the 
 <italic>V. surinamensis</italic> resin EE (500mg/kg, p.o.) significantly inhibits mucosal injury (95% inhibition) in a gastric hemorrhagic ulcerative lesion model induced by an acidified ethanol solution. At the same dose, this extract also significantly reduced the formation of gastric lesions induced by indomethacin (39%), stress (45%), and pylorus ligature (31%) in mice, when compared to control animals. Interestingly, a comparison between the oral and intraduodenal administration of the 
 <italic>V. surinamensis</italic> resin extract indicated therapeutic activity by local action, since no changes in gastric biochemical parameters (pH or total acid) were observed after intraduodenal administration [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-00792" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Being the main constituent of 
 <italic>V. surinamensis</italic> resin EE, epicatechin was suggested to be among the active principles responsible for the plant’s antiulcer activity [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-00792" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. An ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>V. surinamensis</italic> stem bark was prepared and dried, and a 10% (
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) solution diluted in dimethylsulfoxide was further tested for antimicrobial activity by measuring the diameter of the growth inhibition zone [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-26-00792" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The extract exhibited antibacterial activity, particularly against Gram-negative microorganisms, thus providing preliminary scientific validation of its traditional medicinal uses. The phytoconstituents responsible for the antibacterial activity have not yet been identified, but it may be attributable to the presence of high concentrations of tannins, phenolic compounds, or catechin [
