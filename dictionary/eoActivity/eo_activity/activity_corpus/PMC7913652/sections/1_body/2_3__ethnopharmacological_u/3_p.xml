<p>In popular medicine, 
 <italic>V. oleifera</italic> is used to accelerate wound recovery and to treat pain and inflammatory conditions [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-26-00792" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The oil extracted from the seeds of V. oleifera is popularly used for rheumatic pain, bronchial asthma, tumors in the joints, intestinal worms, halitosis, hemorrhoids, and skin diseases [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-26-00792" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Validating its traditional use, 
 <italic>V. oleifera</italic> resin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00792-f001">Figure 1</xref>) demonstrated gastroprotective effects (reduced gastric mucosal damage) in an ethanol/HCl and indomethacin ulcer-induction mouse model at 10 and 100 mg/kg when administered orally 30 min before gastric lesion induction, comparable to the reference control lansoprazole (3 mg/kg) [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-26-00792" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Moreover, the chronic administration of antioxidant resin from 
 <italic>V. oleifera</italic> (50 mg/kg administered orally) also attenuates atherogenesis in the atherosclerotic LDLr
 <sup>−/−</sup> mouse model, through a decrease in vascular lipid deposition, the protection of the vascular endothelium and smooth muscle cells against peroxide-induced cytotoxicity, and the reduction of LPS-induced nitric oxide production in macrophages. Thus, 
 <italic>V. oleifera</italic> resin’s anti-atherogenic activity might be mediated by systemic as well as local antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-00792" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Furthermore, the evaluation of the 
 <italic>V. oleifera</italic> resin (300 mg/kg) in mice has suggested it to be a potential therapeutic solution for radiocontrast-induced nephropathy, due to its antioxidant and antiapoptotic effects and its ability to preserve kidney function by reducing renal dysfunction and morphological tubular injury [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-26-00792" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Our current work also supports the ethnopharmacological use of 
 <italic>V. oleifera</italic> in musculoskeletal malignancies, namely, multiple myeloma, and evidenced its potential as an adjuvant therapy to optimize dexamethasone’s pharmacologic effects and overcome cell drug resistance; nevertheless, herb–drug interactions with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib could limit its clinical use (unpublished data).
