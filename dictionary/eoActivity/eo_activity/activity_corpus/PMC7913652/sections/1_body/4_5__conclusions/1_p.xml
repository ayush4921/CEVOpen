<p>Phytotherapy and the use of medicinal plants are traditionally part of the popular knowledge of different populations, users, and practitioners. The World Health Organization estimated that 80% of the developing countries’ population still relies on traditional medicines, medicinal plants being the most used, for its primary health care; they constitute an effective therapeutic form for the lower-income community. As evidenced in this review, 
 <italic>Virola</italic> genus species are broadly used by local American inhabitants due to their beneficial effects on digestive conditions and rheumatic diseases, as well as inflammatory and infectious illnesses. In the last few years, several efforts have been made to validate the traditional uses of 
 <italic>Virola</italic> spp. in human health and to identify bioactive phytochemicals. Several phenolic compounds, alkaloids, sesquiterpenes, lignans, and neolignans have been identified as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive, and antimicrobial compounds. Of note, most of the studies were conducted on in vivo models, thus confirming their efficacy, therapeutic doses, and bioavailability. In this context, 
 <italic>Virola</italic> genus species are evidenced as potential sources of therapeutic leads, offering novel opportunities in the search for new drugs. However, further basic and clinical research is needed to clarify and confirm the biological actions of 
 <italic>Virola</italic> species and their bioactive molecules, minimizing the possible side and toxicological effects. Finally, studies on the potential herb–drug interactions as well as structure–activity relationships will be of relevance in the development of new pharmaceutics derived from 
 <italic>Virola</italic> species phytochemicals.
