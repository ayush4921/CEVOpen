<p>The 
 <italic>Virola</italic> genus of the Myristicaceae family is found throughout tropical America, where these species have diverse local ethnobotanical uses [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-26-00792" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Seed oils of 
 <italic>Virola</italic> are used as machinery lubricants or soap ingredients or to make candles with intense light, little smoke, and fragrant smells. The seeds and arils can also be used to flavor beverages, such as chocolate drinks, while 
 <italic>Virola</italic> wood is used for construction and carpentry [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-26-00792" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Besides their non-medicinal benefits, 
 <italic>Virola</italic> are perhaps best known for their hallucinogenic properties, which are often used in South American indigenous cultural practices [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-26-00792" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Moreover, the reddish exudate of various 
 <italic>Virola</italic> spp. is applied to treat skin conditions, alleviate tooth pain, and soothe colic, and as an anti-bleeding substance to treat ulcerating sores and wounds, as well as hemorrhoids. Additionally, the seed oils have many folk medicine applications, such as the treatment of asthma, rheumatism, tumors of the joints, intestinal worms, skin diseases, erysipelas, hemorrhoids, and bad breath [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-26-00792" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Therefore, in the last few years, growing research has evaluated the biological effects of species from the 
 <italic>Virola</italic> genus, identifying new promising bioactive compounds.
