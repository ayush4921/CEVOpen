<p>Here, we present an updated and comprehensive review on 
 <italic>Virola</italic> species, focusing on their ethnopharmacological uses and phytochemistry. The botany of the 
 <italic>Virola</italic> genus, in particular, the distinctive morphological and anatomic characteristics of various 
 <italic>Virola</italic> species, are also described in order to support exact species identification, which is relevant for the establishment of unique and unequivocal pharmacological activities, and the reproducibility of research on the biological activity of their phytochemicals. The final aim of this review is to support the safe medicinal use of plant extracts and provide guidance for future research on new molecules with pharmaceutical activity.
