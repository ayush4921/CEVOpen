 <p>This study aimed to determine the composition and content of polyphenols in the dry extract obtained from the hydrodistilled residue by-product of the wild bergamot (
  <italic>Monarda fistulosa</italic> L., 
  <italic>Lamiaceae</italic> Martinov family) herb (MFDE) and to evaluate its safety and pharmacological properties. The total phenolic content (TPC) in the MFDE was 120.64 mg GAE/g. The high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis showed the presence of a plethora of phenolic compounds, including hydroxycinnamic acids and flavone derivatives in the MFDE, with rosmarinic acid and luteolin-7-
  <italic>O</italic>-glucoside being the main components. With an IC
  <sub>50</sub> value of 0.285 mg/mL, it was found to be a strong DPPH radical scavenger. The acute toxicity study results indicate that the oral administration of MFDE to rats at the doses of 500–5,000 mg/kg did not produce any side effects or death in animals which indicates its safety. The results of the 
  <italic>in vivo</italic> assay showed that the MFDE dose-dependently inhibited paw oedema and significantly reduced the number of writings in mice induced by the acetic acid injection suggesting its potent anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities, respectively. The conducted studies revealed that 
  <italic>M. fistulosa</italic> hydrodistilled residue by-product could be regarded as a new natural source of polyphenols with valuable pharmacological properties.
