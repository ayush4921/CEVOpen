<p>The other groups of biologically active compounds of 
 <italic>Monarda</italic> genus representatives such as flavonoids or hydroxycinnamic acids were studied less. Some of the scientific studies about the polyphenols composition of these species were published not only in the peer-reviewed journals (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Banach and Olechnowicz-Stepien, 1986</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Davies and Mazza, 1992</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Savickiene et al., 2002</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Krasyuk and Pupyrkina, 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Shanaida et al., 2018a</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Shanaida et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Vysochina, 2020</xref>). Flavonoids such as rutin, hyperoside, quercetin, quercitrin, and luteolin were found in the leaves and flowers of 
 <italic>M. didyma</italic> grown in Lithuania by the HPLC method (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Savickiene et al., 2002</xref>). Rosmarinic acid and flavonoids hyperoside, rutin, naringin, and naringenin were identified in the 
 <italic>M. didyma</italic> herb by the high-performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">HPTLC method for identification of medicinal plants (method collection), 2012</xref>). 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Davies and Mazza (1992)</xref> found that anthocyanin pelargonidin 3,5-diglucoside accounted for 17% of the total flavonoid content in the petals of 
 <italic>M. fistulosa</italic> flowers. Among the other detected flavonoids were apigenin-7-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucosides, dihydroxyflavone 8-
 <italic>C</italic>-glucoside, and 5-hydroxyflavone (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Davies and Mazza, 1992</xref>). Six flavonoid glucosides were isolated from the 
 <italic>M. pectinata</italic> aerial part, i.e., acacetin-7-rutinoside, isosacuranetine-7-rutinoside, and luteolin-7-glucoside (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Banach and Olechnowicz-Stepien, 1986</xref>). It was found that 
 <italic>Monarda</italic> species introduced in the Republic of Bashkortostan (Russia) accumulated the total content of flavonoids calculated as luteolin equivalent at the levels of 1.57% in 
 <italic>M. fistulosa</italic>, 1.63% in 
 <italic>M. didyma</italic>, 1.61% in 
 <italic>M. citriodora</italic>, 1.52% in 
 <italic>M. hybrida</italic> Wender., and 0.91% in 
 <italic>M. russelliana</italic> Nutt. (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Krasyuk and Pupyrkina, 2016</xref>). Rosmarinic acid was found to be the main component of aqueous and methanol extracts obtained from the 
 <italic>M. fistulosa</italic> herb grown in Ukraine (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Shanaida et al., 2018a</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Shanaida et al., 2020</xref>). The preventive and healing properties of polyphenols are mostly related to their antioxidant effects which could be useful in the treatment of inflammation, pain, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancer (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Pudziuvelyte et al., 2020</xref>). Many chronic diseases of human and animal bodies lead to releasing reactive oxygen or nitrogen species, causing cell injury mainly through their oxidative degradation (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Libby, 2007</xref>). As a result, inflammation is developing, nociceptors are sensitized, and it becomes painful (
