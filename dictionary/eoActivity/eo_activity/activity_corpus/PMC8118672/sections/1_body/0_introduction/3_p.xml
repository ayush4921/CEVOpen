 <italic>M. fistulosa</italic> has been successfully introduced to the European countries. Research institutions are conducting the acclimatization and breeding of new cultivars of this species (

 <italic>M. fistulosa</italic> has been the most widely used effective local medicine across American Indian cultures in North America (
