<p>This is the first research of the polyphenol profiles and pharmacological activities of the hydrodistilled residue by-product obtained from the 
 <italic>M. fistulosa</italic> herb. The complex processing of the 
 <italic>M. fistulosa</italic> raw material allows using rationally its post-hydrodistillation waste simultaneously with obtaining essential oil that enhances the overall profitability of this aromatic plant. The chromatographic analyses of polyphenols in the obtained MFDE revealed a high amount of rosmarinic acid, luteolin-7-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside, and other polyphenols with the valuable therapeutic properties. The high TPC in the MFDE correlated with its potent IC
 <sub>50</sub> value. The administration of the obtained extract at the doses up to 5,000Â mg/kg did not induce any toxic reactions. The 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> assay revealed dose-dependent anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities of MFDE. Therefore, the results of this study indicate that hydrodistilled residue by-product from the 
 <italic>M. fistulosa</italic> herb may represent a new natural source of polyphenols with significant pharmacological potential. The investigated extract could be also exploited as a health-promoting substance in food or cosmetic products.
