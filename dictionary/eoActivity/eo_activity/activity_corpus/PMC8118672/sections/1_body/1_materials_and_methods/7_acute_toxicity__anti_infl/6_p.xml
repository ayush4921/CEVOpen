 <italic>n</italic> = 6 animals/group). The animals of the experimental groups were orally pretreated with the MFDE (50, 100, or 200 mg/kg), and the reference group was given “Metamizole sodium” (55 mg/kg) in 60 min before the intraperitoneal injection of 0.6% solution of acetic acid. The animals of the control group were pretreated before the intraperitoneal injection of acetic acid with the vehicle (1% solution of Tween-80 in distilled water). The mice were individually placed into the chambers. The number of stretching the hind limbs and writhing was counted for 20 min.
