<p>The HPTLC analysis of phenolic compounds was carried out using a CAMAG analytical system (Switzerland) (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Stanek et al., 2019</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Shanaida et al., 2020</xref>). The MFDE was dissolved in methanol (1.0 mg/mL) and filtered through a 0.45 μm Millipore filter to obtain a test solution. A standard solution consisted of the available reference standards dissolved in methanol (0.25 mg/mL). The test and standards solutions in a volume of 5 μL were applied to chromatographic plates (20 cm × 10 cm) using an automatic application device. The mobile phase consisted of ethyl acetate: formic acid: water (15:1:1). The detection of polyphenols spots was based on their natural fluorescence after the postchromatographic derivatization by 1% AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> solution at 254 and 366 nm.
