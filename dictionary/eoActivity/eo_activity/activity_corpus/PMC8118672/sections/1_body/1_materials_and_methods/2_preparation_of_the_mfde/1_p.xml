<p>The MFDE was obtained from the postdistillation waste of 
 <italic>M. fistulosa</italic> herb in two stages (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Shanaida, 2020</xref>): by aqueous extraction in the hydrodistillation process and by using 50% ethanol at the next stage as it was described for

 <italic>.</italic> leaves by 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Vovk et al. (2016)</xref>. 120.0 g of ground herb of 
 <italic>M. fistulosa</italic> was used for obtaining the MFDE. The raw plant material was divided into four portions and subjected to hydrodistillation for 2 h (the ratio of the raw material to purified water was 1:15) (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">European Pharmacopoeia, 2016</xref>). After the separation of essential oil (1.87%), the aqueous extract was cooled, then filtered through a paper filter, and maintained for 24 h in a refrigerator (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Shanaida, 2020</xref>). On the next stage, the decanted solution was evaporated in a vacuum rotary evaporator to 1/10 of an initial volume. Then, 1.2 L of 50% ethanol was added to the waste, and it was extracted using a boiling water heater for 40 min. After cooling, the filtrate was put in the refrigerator (for 24 h) to sediment ballast, then decanted, and evaporated to 1/10 of an initial volume. The obtained concentrated extracts were combined and dried in a vacuum spray dryer to obtain the MFDE
