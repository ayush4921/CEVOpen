<p>The HPLC analysis of polyphenols was performed using the Shimadzu HPLC-DAD system using the Phenomenex Luna C18 column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 µm particle size) at 35°C. The UV absorption spectra of the available reference standards and the test samples were recorded in the range of 190–400 nm. Gradient elution conducted by mixing the mobile phases A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water) and B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min according to
