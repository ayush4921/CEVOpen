<p>The TPC was measured according to the Folin–Ciocalteu method (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Singleton and Rossi, 1965</xref>) with a Hitachi UV/VIS spectrophotometer and calculated as gallic acid equivalents (mg GAE/g extract). To plot the calibration curve, gallic acid was dissolved in purified water for obtaining the solutions in the range of 0.02–0.14 mg/mL (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Shanaida et al., 2018a</xref>). Briefly, 0.1 mL of the aqueous solution of MFDE (concentration 0.5 mg/mL) was mixed with 1.5 mL of purified water, 0.1 mL of undiluted Folin-Ciocalteu reagent, and 0.3 mL of 20% Na
