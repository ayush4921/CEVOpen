<p>The inhibition of DPPH radicals by the MFDE was studied using the Hitachi U-2810 UV/VIS spectrophotometer according to the method of 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Gougoulias and Mashev (2015)</xref>. The MFDE and DPPH reagent were dissolved in methanol before the analysis. 0.1 mL of each test sample in various concentrations (0.1–1.0 mg/mL) was mixed in the flask with 1.9 mL of DPPH solution in methanol (25 μg/mL), and this mixture was incubated for 30 min in darkness at room temperature. The absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 517 nm. The concentration of the antioxidants presented in the test solution required to scavenge 50% of DPPH was expressed as an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value;
