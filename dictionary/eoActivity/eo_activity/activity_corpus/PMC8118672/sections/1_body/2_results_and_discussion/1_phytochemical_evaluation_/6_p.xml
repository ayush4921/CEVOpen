<p>The 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> DPPH radical scavenging assay showed that the MFDE possesses strong antiradical activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.285 mg/mL. It is possible to compare the obtained results of DPPH inhibition with data of the other researchers of 
 <italic>Lamiaceae</italic> species. Several 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assays revealed a higher antioxidant potential of water extracts from the 
 <italic>Nepeta</italic> spp. postdistillation residues comparatively to acetone extracts isolated from its dried waste (

 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> and 
 <italic>Hyssopus officinalis</italic> herbs prepared with 70% ethanol showed the prominent DPPH free radical inhibiting activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.1249 and 0.1254 mg/mL, respectively (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Vlase et al., 2014</xref>). The methanol extract of 
 <italic>Marrubium peregrinum</italic> herb demonstrated stronger antioxidant activity against DPPH radical (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.187 mg/mL) than its water extract (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.481 mg/mL) which indicates the positive effect of lower alcohols on the extraction of polyphenols from the plant raw material (

 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside containing three of them in the aglycon part possess the significant antioxidant potential (
