<p>In the acute toxicity study, the general behavior of rats was recorded for 14 days after the MFDE administration. The results of this study indicate that the MFDE administered at doses of 500, 1,500, and 5,000 mg/kg did not induce any side effects or death of the experimental animals. No mortalities and other signs of adverse effects such as respiratory distress, convulsions, and changes of activity occurred in the animals tested during 14 days of behavioral observation. It suggests that up to 5,000 mg/kg the MFDE could be considered as safe.</p>
