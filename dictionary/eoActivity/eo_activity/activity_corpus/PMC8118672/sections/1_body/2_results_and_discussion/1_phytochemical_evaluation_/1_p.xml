<p>By using aqueous extraction in the hydrodistillation process and 50% ethanol at the next stage, a 23.17% MFDE yield was obtained. The TPC content was found to be 120.64 ± 2.65 mg GAE/g. This value was higher than those observed for other 
 <italic>Lamiaceae</italic> species. Thus, 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Vlase et al. (2014)</xref> revealed that the TPC in the extracts of 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> and 
 <italic>Hyssopus officinalis</italic> L. herbs cultivated in Romania (extraction with 70% ethanol on a waterbath) was 175.57 mg GAE/g and 77.72 mg GAE/g of raw material, respectively. The researchers revealed that TPC in the aerial parts of eight 
 <italic>Lamiaceae</italic> species from Manipur (India) extracted with 80% ethanol varied in the range of 21.39–46.28 mg GAE/g of the herb (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Khomdram and Potsangbam, 2011</xref>). The TPC in the 
 <italic>Marrubium peregrinum</italic> L. herb collected in Serbia ranged from 27.26 to 89.78 mg GAE/g dependently of solvents (methanol, water, ethyl-acetate, acetone, or petroleum ether) used for maceration (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Stanković, 2011</xref>). The TPC value of the 65–70% ethanol extracts of 
 <italic>Salvia sclarea</italic> herb cultivated in Ukraine varied from 6.69 to 14.91 mg GAE per 1 gram of the herb (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Hudz et al., 2019</xref>). The decoction of 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> L. herb was characterized by the highest concentration of flavonoids and TPC than the infusion or hydroalcoholic extract (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Martins et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, the mean TPC in the plant raw materials of the 
 <italic>Lamiaceae</italic> representatives highly depends on the species of plant, its geographical origin, as well as solvents and extraction procedures chosen for analysis.
