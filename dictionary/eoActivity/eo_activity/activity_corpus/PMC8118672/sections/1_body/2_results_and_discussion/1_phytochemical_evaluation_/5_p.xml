<p>The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of flavones found in the MFDE were proven by many researchers (

 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) and its aglycon luteolin potently strengthen the HO-1-mediated antioxidative effect (

 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside was confirmed using the ABTS assay (

 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Aziz et al. (2018)</xref> pointed out that plants with a prominent content of luteolin have been used in a folk medicine to treat inflammation-associated diseases. Numerous 
 <italic>in silico, in vitro</italic>, and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments confirmed the strong anti-inflammatory activity of this flavone derivative (
