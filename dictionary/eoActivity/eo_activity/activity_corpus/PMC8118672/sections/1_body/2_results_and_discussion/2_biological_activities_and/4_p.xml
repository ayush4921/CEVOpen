<p>The writhing test induced by acetic acid is a widespread model to evaluate the peripheral antinociceptive effects of drugs (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Karim et al., 2019</xref>). The pain provoked by the injection of acetic acid intraperitoneally is the consequence of irritation of chemosensitive nociceptors and causes releasing algogenic compounds such as prostaglandins, serotonin, histamine, and bradykinin (

 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> shows that the analgesic effect the MFDE is manifested in a dose-dependent manner. The animals of the control group demonstrated 63.27 ± 1.49 writhing count, while the MFDE at a dose of 50 mg/kg reduced it to 49.8 ± 1.21. Higher doses of the extract decreased the writhing counts more significantly: 100 mg/kg to 36.24 ± 0.76 and 200 mg/kg to 30.85 ± 0.71. Thus, the MFDE in the highest dose (200 mg/kg) induced a noticeable reduction in the number of writhing in the mice provoked by the injection of acetic acid which was close to the reference drug. The revealed pharmacological effect of the MFDE could be attributed to a significant amount of polyphenols. A similar analgesic effect was found for the high dose of aqueous extract of 
 <italic>Plectranthus glandulosus</italic> Hook. (
 <italic>Lamiaceae</italic>) leaves rich in phenolic compounds (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Magne et al., 2016</xref>). The aqueous extract from the 
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> L. leaves in a dose range of 100–400 mg/kg and rosmarinic acid at the doses of 10–40 mg/kg demonstrated their effectiveness in the management of pain and inflammation (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Lucarini et al., 2013</xref>). The healing properties of rosmarinic acid were found in the experimental neuropathic pain in rats, and its anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic activities have the key role in the observed antinociceptive effect (
