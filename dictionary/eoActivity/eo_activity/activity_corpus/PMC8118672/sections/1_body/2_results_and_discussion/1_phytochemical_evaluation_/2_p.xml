<p>The chromatographic fingerprints of polyphenols in the MFDE were obtained using the HPTLC method. The zones sequence presented in the chromatograms of the reference standards and test solution scanned at 366Â nm before and after derivatization with 1% AlCl

 </sub> = 0.75 corresponding to rosmarinic acid; weaker light blue zones of caffeic acid were presented just above the rosmarinic acid spots (R
