<p>The investigated MFDE significantly decreases in paw oedema of rats caused by the injection of carrageenan compared to the control group at 3 h of induced inflammation (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Anti-inflammatory activity was manifested by the MFDE in a dose-dependent manner; the highest tested dose (200 mg/kg) reduced paw oedema mostly (by 31.91% at the 3 h). The MFDE at a dose of 50 mg/kg did not demonstrate the noticeable anti-inflammatory effect when compared with the reference drug; this dose significantly inhibited paw oedema only after 3 and 6 h when compared with the control. The reference drug diclofenac caused a significant decrease paw oedema at all the hours of the experiment. According to different

 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Luo et al., 2020</xref>), rosmarinic acid, which was found to be the predominant component of the MFDE, demonstrated the prominent anti-inflammatory effect due to the inhibition of lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase pathways. Researchers revealed that administration of pure rosmarinic acid at a dose of 25 mg/kg reduced paw oedema in rats at 6 h by over 60% (

 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Salehi et al., 2019</xref>), also possess the significant anti-inflammatory potential. Luteolin showed a significant anti-inflammatory activity in mice models induced by the carrageenan and reduced the number of abdominal constrictions caused by the acetic acid (
