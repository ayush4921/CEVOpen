    "This study aimed to determine the composition and content of polyphenols in the dry extract obtained from the hydrodistilled residue by-product of the wild bergamot (<i>Monarda fistulosa</i> L., <i>Lamiaceae</i> Martinov family) herb (MFDE) and to evaluate its safety and pharmacological properties. The total phenolic content (TPC) in the MFDE was 120.64 mg GAE/g. The high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis showed the presence of a plethora of phenolic compounds, including hydroxycinnamic acids and flavone derivatives in the MFDE, with rosmarinic acid and luteolin-7-<i>O</i>-glucoside being the main components. With an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.285 mg/mL, it was found to be a strong DPPH radical scavenger. The acute toxicity study results indicate that the oral administration of MFDE to rats at the doses of 500-5,000 mg/kg did not produce any side effects or death in animals which indicates its safety. The results of the <i>in vivo</i> assay showed that the MFDE dose-dependently inhibited paw oedema and significantly reduced the number of writings in mice induced by the acetic acid injection suggesting its potent anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities, respectively. The conducted studies revealed that <i>M. fistulosa</i> hydrodistilled residue by-product could be regarded as a new natural source of polyphenols with valuable pharmacological properties."
