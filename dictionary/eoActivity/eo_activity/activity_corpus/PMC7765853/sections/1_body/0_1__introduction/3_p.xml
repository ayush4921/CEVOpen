<p>The essential oils, the most relevant constituents for the medicinal value of 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic>, are synthesized in peltate glandular trichomes, which occur on the surface of stems, leaves, and flowers (sepals, petals). These trichomes have an enlarged secretory head, made up of 12–16 glandulous cells covered by a common cuticle (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-09653-f001">Figure 1</xref>); volatile oils are released upon rupture of the cuticle. Except for these peltate hairs, much smaller capitate hairs also occur on both sides of the leaves and the epidermis of the kalyx. They have a 1–2 celled head and seem to be involved in the synthesis of other more hydrophilic metabolites like phenolic compounds and polysaccharides [

The factors that influence the density and size of glandular trichomes, and, thus, directly impact the yield in essential oil, are defined both genetically and environmentally. Greek oregano displays an increased density and size of peltate trichomes, in contrast to common oregano [

Interestingly, the chemical profile of the essential oil also varies with the altitude: in the Venetian region, lowland plants were shown to synthesize monoterpene and sesquiterpene hydrocarbon-rich essential oils, while high-altitude plants contained high amounts of aromatic and hydrocarbon monoterpenes and low amounts of sesquiterpenes [

 <xref rid="B9-ijms-21-09653" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], while plant density does not affect the number of glandular hairs per leaf surface unit [
