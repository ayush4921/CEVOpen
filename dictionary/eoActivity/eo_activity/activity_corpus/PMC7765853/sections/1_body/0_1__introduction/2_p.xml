 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> is a perennial plant with a woody base and herbaceous stems, growing to a height of 20–80 cm. Its leaves are opposite, egg-shaped, 1–4 cm long, and 0.5–2.5 cm wide; the leaf margin is smooth and the tip varies from rounded to pointed. The flowers are relatively small, grouped in terminal and lateral paniculate inflorescences. Their corolla consists of 5 united petals, 0.4–0.8 cm long, having a white to purple color. The sepals are as well reunited; the inner part of the flower contains fours stamens and the pistil is constituted by two fused carpels. The fruits are small nutlets [

 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> is a highly variable species, encompassing several subspecies, varieties, chemotypes, and hybrids. Six subspecies are recognized: 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>glandulosum</italic> (Desf.) Ietsw., subsp. 
 <italic>gracile</italic> (K.Koch) Ietsw., subsp. 
 <italic>hirtum</italic> (Link) A.Terracc., subsp.

 <xref rid="B5-ijms-21-09653" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The first three subspecies are typical for the southern range of the species and considered to be of high quality and rich in volatile oils, as opposed to the last three subspecies vegetating in more Northern regions, and poorer in essential oils [
