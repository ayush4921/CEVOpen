<p>The ability of phytocompounds present in essential oils to inhibit acetylcholinesterase is interesting, as it can be used as possible treatment of some nervous illnesses such as Alzheimer’s disease [
 <xref rid="B79-ijms-21-09653" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Carrasco et al. tested 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> cholinesterase inhibitory activity of essential oils obtained from 2 samples of 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> L. grown in Supra Mediterranean and Upper Meso-Mediterranean bioclimatic regions in Murcia, Spain. Quantitative determination of the relative and chiral distribution of the main components of each EO was performed by fast gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (FGS/MS). Results showed that myrcene, 
 <italic>γ</italic>-terpinene, and thymol were found in high proportion in OEO from Supra Mediterranean bioclimatic region, whereas high concentrations of 1,8-cineole, linalool, borneol, carvacrol, and 
 <italic>β</italic>-bisabolene were found in OEO Meso-Mediterranean field. Concerning inhibitory the activity on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> L. grown in Supra Mediterranean region had the greatest inhibitory activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 73.7 ± 0.5 µL EO/L), followed by OEO from Meso-Mediterranean region (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 61.5 ± 0.5 µL EO/L) [
