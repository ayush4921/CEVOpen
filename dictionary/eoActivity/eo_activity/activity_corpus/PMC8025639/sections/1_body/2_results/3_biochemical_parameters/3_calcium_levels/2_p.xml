<p>Serum calcium levels in the experimental groups have been shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="vms3372-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, B. As depicted, ovariectomy caused a significant decrease in the calcium level of the OVX group compared with the sham and control (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Remarkably, the administration of flaxseed oil increased calcium levels during the treatment with a 
 <italic>p</italic>‐value &lt;.001 compared with the OVX group. No significant difference was observed between the flaxseed oil‐treated rats and the estradiol‐treated rats.
