<p>As might be expected, ovariectomy decreased the myometer thickness (Figure 
 <xref rid="vms3372-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7A</xref>) and volume significantly with 
 <italic>P</italic>‐value &lt;.001 (Figure 
 <xref rid="vms3372-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7B</xref>). Flaxseed oil administration improved the mentioned parameters in such a way that an acceptable increase compared with the OVX group was seen (
 <italic>p</italic> = .005 for myometer thickness and 
 <italic>p</italic> = .032 for myometer volume compared with the OVX group).
