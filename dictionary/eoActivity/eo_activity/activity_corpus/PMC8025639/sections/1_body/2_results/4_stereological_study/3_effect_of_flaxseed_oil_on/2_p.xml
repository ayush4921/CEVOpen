<p>Similar, but less clear effects were observed on the perimeter ovarian thickness compared with endometrial. The perimetrium thickness was reduced by ovariectomy; however, the intake of flaxseed reversed it to normal conditions (Figure 
 <xref rid="vms3372-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>). In the case of perimeter ovarian volume (Figure 
 <xref rid="vms3372-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>), it can be seen that the treatment of rats with flaxseed oil and estradiol enhanced the volume with a 
 <italic>P</italic>‐value of .026 and .16, respectively, compared with OVX group. No significant difference was observed between the flaxseeds oil‐treated rats and the estradiol‐treated rats.
