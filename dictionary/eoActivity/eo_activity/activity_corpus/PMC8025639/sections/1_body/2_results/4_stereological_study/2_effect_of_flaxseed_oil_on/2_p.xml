 <xref rid="vms3372-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. A, an increase in the uterus weight was evident in the OVX + estradiol and OVX + Linum groups in comparison with the OVX (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Also, statistical analysis did not show any significant difference between the uterus weight of positive control and the treated group. Similarly, the uterus volume of OVX + Linum group also demonstrated an increase compared with the OVX group (
 <italic>p</italic> = .037).
