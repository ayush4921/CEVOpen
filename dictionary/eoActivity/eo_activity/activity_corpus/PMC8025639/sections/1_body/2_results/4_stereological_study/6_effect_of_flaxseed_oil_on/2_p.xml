<p>Based on the data presented in Figure 
 <xref rid="vms3372-fig-0008" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, ovariectomy decreased the vessel ovarian diameter significantly compared with the control group (
 <italic>p</italic> = .001). Administration of flaxseed oil meaningfully increased the vessel ovarian diameter compared with the OVX group (
 <italic>p</italic> = .001) and returned these parameters to around normal conditions without significant differences compared with the control group.
