<p>As predicted in Figure 
 <xref rid="vms3372-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, A. plasma ALP level significantly increased in the OVX rats compared with the sham‐operated and control groups (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). A significant decrease in the ALP levels was observed in the flaxseed oil‐treated rats and the estradiol‐treated rats compared with OVX group (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ .001). Interestingly, the flaxseed oil‐treated group (OVX + Linum rats group) brought even more decrease in the ALP levels compared with OVX + Estradiol group as standard, although the change was not significant.
