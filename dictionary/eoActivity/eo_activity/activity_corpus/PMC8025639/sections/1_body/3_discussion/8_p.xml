<p>Different mechanism explains the synergic effect of oestrogen and PUFAs. First, the beneficial actions of oestrogen depend on PUFA, specifically, PUFA increases the sensitivity of receptors towards oestrogen and can modulate the binding of hormones (even at very low concentration) to their nuclear receptors and produced appropriate and enough response. As a result, when the levels of PUFAs decrease, the binding of oestrogen to its receptors will not be optimum, leading to suboptimal responses (Das,

The correlation between them could be enhanced during the overproduction of NO which plays an important role in atherosclerosis, osteoporosis, neurodegenerative conditions and memory (Das,

 <xref rid="vms3372-bib-0076" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>). PUFAs may be key to the actions of oestrogen due to altering the expression of receptors on the cells. Hence, a combination of PUFAs and oestrogen may be necessary to optimize their benefit and response (Nordoy et al.,
