<p>The main finding of this study was that flaxseed oil treatment prevented the impairment and disorders induced by ovariectomy. However, further studies are required to elucidate the mechanism of action and its potential use for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. The different dosage forms of flaxseed oil including tablets, syrups and the transdermal patch can be developed to evaluate the effectiveness, biocompatibility and bioavailability of the mentioned oil. Also, MRI analysis can be performed as the diagnostic and prognostic techniques to determine the structural changes related to the uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes before and after drug administration. In the next step, the clinical trial study can be conducted to ensure that medical intervention and treatment are safe and effective. These findings including pharmacological and biochemical results could be useful to change lifestyle strategies such as diet among postmenopausal and OVX women.</p>
