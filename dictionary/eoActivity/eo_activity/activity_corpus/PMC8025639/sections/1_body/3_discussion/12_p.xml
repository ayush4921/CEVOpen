<p>The mechanisms by which flaxseed improves biochemical, stereological parameters and the mechanical property in the lumen are not clear. The high potency of flaxseed may be due to high PUFAs and oestrogen‐like compounds alongside its antioxidant capacity. The current study demonstrated the significant increase in calcium and alkaline phosphate level due to the consumption of flaxseed which is close to the control and sham group. Also, oil had a therapeutic impact on ovarian thickness and volume. Besides, flaxseed oil antioxidants could be another factor that lowers the side of OVX. The data in this study showed this oil can be used as a complementary and low‐cost treatment to reduce the dose and side effects of estradiol during menopause after ovarian problems. A closer look at published data confirms a close and accurate connection between our results and published data.</p>
