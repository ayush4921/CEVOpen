<p>The high interest in consumption of flaxseed oil as a medicinal and nutritional product is mainly due to its high PUFA content (especially omega‐3 and omega‐6 groups), lignans, high‐quality proteins, fibres and carbohydrates. Although the composition of flaxseed can vary with genetics, growing environment, seed processing and method of analysis (Bernacchia et al., 
 <xref rid="vms3372-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Rubilar et al., 
 <xref rid="vms3372-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>), PUFAs are a family of lipids identified by the position of the last double bond in their structure. Several studies confirmed that flaxseed oil is a rich source of essential PUFA such as linoleic acid and α‐linolenic acid which regulate prostaglandin synthesis and, hence, enhance the wound‐healing process. Besides omega‐3, characterized as the most known PUFA, improve the development of the nervous system, reducing cardiovascular disease and cancer. Omega‐3 is also known to lessen the severity and minimize symptoms of chronic inflammatory and inflammatory bowel disease. However, direct evidence of potentially beneficial effects of dietary PUFA on human osteoporosis is still lacking. Omega‐3 fatty acids consumption reduces plasma triglycerides (TG) levels, and small dense LP while increasing large buoyant LDL and HDL‐C, may result in an improved lipid profile (Pirillo &amp; Catapano,
