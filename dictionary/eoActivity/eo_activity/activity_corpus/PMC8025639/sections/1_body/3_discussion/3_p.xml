<p>The main issue is that oestrogen and progesterone changes due to ovariectomy and alter biochemical factors including alkaline phosphate and calcium level (Ghazvini et al., 
 <xref rid="vms3372-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Shen et al., 
 <xref rid="vms3372-bib-0061" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Oestrogen is lipophilic steroid hormone that binds to nuclear oestrogen receptors (ERα and ERβ), regulates gene expression within DNA, activates gene transcription and stimulates steroidal hormone (González‐Bengtsson et al., 
 <xref rid="vms3372-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Additionally, oestrogens can activate the cell surface G‐protein coupled Oestrogen Receptor (GPER) which promotes cyclic AMP (cAMP) and lesser intracellular Ca

 <xref rid="vms3372-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>; Sharma et al., 
 <xref rid="vms3372-bib-0060" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). However, the exact contributions of oestrogen signalling through ERα, ERβ or GPER related to lipid and lipoprotein metabolism are not well defined (Palmisano et al., 
 <xref rid="vms3372-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). In return, the loss of oestrogens in adult animals is associated with body weight gain and the development of obesity (Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="vms3372-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). Moreover, deficiency of oestrogen reduces thiol antioxidant defences in bone cells and the expression of TNFα, which prompt apoptosis and causes loss of bone (Jagger et al., 
 <xref rid="vms3372-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>; Lean et al., 
 <xref rid="vms3372-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>). Also due to the reduction in ovarian hormones, uterine structure and ovarian thickness changes and as a result endometrial atrophy happened. Another problem in ovariectomized women is oxidant/antioxidant imbalance that can exacerbate their well‐being. There is increasing evidence suggesting the destructive role of free radicals oxidative damage on cells and bone (Muthusami et al., 
 <xref rid="vms3372-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). Menopause happens due to the loss of ovarian follicular function, decreases follicle‐stimulating hormone and oestrogen levels. These may result in bone turnover, urogenital and menstrual cycle disorders, vasomotor changes and unpleasant symptoms such as irritability, arthralgias, sleep disturbances and mood swings (Das, 
 <xref rid="vms3372-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). However, the exact mechanism of bone metabolism by oestrogens is not clear. The protective effect of oestrogens on bone mass maintenance may be the result of nonnuclear initiated signalling of the ERα (Almeida et al., 
 <xref rid="vms3372-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). H

 <xref rid="vms3372-bib-0073" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>, 
 <xref rid="vms3372-bib-0074" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). As a result consumption of high amounts of antioxidants can markedly improve functions in ovariectomized cases.
