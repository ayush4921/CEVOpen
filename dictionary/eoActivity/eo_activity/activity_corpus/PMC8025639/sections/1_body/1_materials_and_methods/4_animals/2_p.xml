Fifty adult female Sprague‐Dawley rats, aged 6 months, weighing between 200 ± 20 g were purchased from the laboratory animal's centre of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences. The rats were maintained under standard housing laboratory conditions, the relative humidity of 60 ± 5%, the temperature of 23 ± 2°C and 12‐hr light/dark cycles and were fed with a standard pellet diet and water ad libitum.
