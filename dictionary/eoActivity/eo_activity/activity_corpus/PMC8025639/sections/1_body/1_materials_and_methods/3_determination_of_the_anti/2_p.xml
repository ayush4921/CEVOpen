<p>The method consisted of spectrophotometric measurement of the intensity of the colour change in a solution containing 2,2‐diphenyl‐1‐picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). The test sample solutions (20 μL) containing different concentrations of the oil in MeOH were mixed with a methanolic solution of DPPH (180 µM). This mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and finally, absorbance was measured at 517 nm with a spectrophotometer (Ardakani Movaghati et al.,

Methanol was regarded as a blank for the microplate reader. Quercetin was used as the reference antioxidant with the half‐maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) of 9.1 ± 0.42 µM. The results of the DPPH assay were expressed as IC
 <sub>50</sub> values by the Curve Expert software (for Windows, version 1.34) (Ostovar et al.,
