<p>Bilateral ovariectomy (OVX) and sham operation were undergone anaesthesia with ketamine 10% (100 mg/kg, Alfasan, Netherlands) and xylazine 2% (10 mg/kg, Alfasan, Netherlands). After ligation of the uterine horn through a midline longitudinal incision, both ovaries were surgically removed in all the groups, except for the control and sham groups. The sham‐operated rats had their ventral incision, but the manipulation of ovaries was performed without excising them.</p>
