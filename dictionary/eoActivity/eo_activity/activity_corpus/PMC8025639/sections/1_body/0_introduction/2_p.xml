<p>Ovariectomy (OVX) regarded as one of the most common surgical procedures in the world with approximately one third of women all around the world (Laughlin‐Tommaso et al.,

Ovarian hormones play a pivotal role in maintaining the integrity and function of female genital tissue structure, and shown to enhance genital sensation, maintain blood flow, rugae of the vaginal wall as well as vaginal lubrication (Traish et al.,

As a result, developing new candidate or improving diet by modifying the amount and type of fat ingested, which in turn improves lipid profile without side effects, have raised the prospect of new intervention with a much lower cost than drugs.
