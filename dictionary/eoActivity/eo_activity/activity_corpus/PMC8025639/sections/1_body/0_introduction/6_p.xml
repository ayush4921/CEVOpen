<p>The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of the flaxseed oil on the lipid profiles, biochemical, hormonal indexes in serum and uterine stereological in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Flaxseed oil is an exceptionally safe natural product and a rich source of PUFA specifically in ω‐3 fatty acids, phytoestrogenic lignans and an array of antioxidants. We hypothesized that flaxseed oil administration as a nutritious meal would regulate the biochemical and hormonal pathway and have a positive impact on the ovariectomized rats as a model of human menopause.</p>
