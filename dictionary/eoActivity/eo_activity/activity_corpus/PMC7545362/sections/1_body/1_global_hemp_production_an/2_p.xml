<p>Hemp varieties are rarely used for medicinal purposes because they have low THC content (&lt;0.2%) (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Hemp production is low as it is often confused with marijuana which is illegal to cultivate in most countries (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). However, many countries have legalized the commercial production of hemp and utilization of its by-products (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). For example, South Africa recently passed a law to license cultivation and processing of hempseed using varieties with &lt;0.001% THC (

The liberalization of hemp legalization by many countries is likely to increase oil production, and consequent utilization of its by-products (i.e., HSC and leaf meals). This increase in oil, HSC, and leaf meal could potentially be beneficial to hemp processing, animal feed and meat industries. Currently, hemp by-products are not recognized as commercial livestock feed ingredients in most countries, even though some have come up with inclusion guidelines for livestock diets (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Generally, limited literature exists on the utilization of hemp by-products except for the oil (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The value of hemp by-products as animal feed lies in the nutritional and phytochemical contents of HSC, especially when leaf production is limited.
