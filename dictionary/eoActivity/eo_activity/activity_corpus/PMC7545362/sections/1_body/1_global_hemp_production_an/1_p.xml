<p>Globally, the FAO estimates of 32 square kilometers (km
 <sup>2</sup>) of hemp are harvested including 143 metric tons (MT) hempseed, 50 MT seed oil, 93 MT cake, and 331 MT leaves are produced mainly from France, China, and Chile (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), but this does not include Canada or the USA, which are also major producers with an estimated 315 km
 <sup>2</sup> (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) and 1,160 km
 <sup>2</sup> (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) under cultivation, respectively. Overall, scant data exists on hemp or by-products production, especially in Africa. Hemp is a multifaceted plant commonly cultivated for fiber and oil, although other components of the plant might have beneficial uses as medicine (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Primary uses of hemp are determined by variety and region of origin (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The majority of hemp varieties are cultivated for seed production, of which, hempseed oil is the primary valuable output (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). On average, hempseed has 30–35% seed oil, that is extracted only by cold pressing (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), with HSC being the main solid by-product of oil extraction. Cold-press method preserves physical and chemical quality of oil (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). A small proportion (i.e., 0.4–10%) of the oil is retained in HSC after extraction (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Hemp stems are utilized in the textile, livestock (i.e., beddings), and automotive industries as they utilize a large amount of fiber (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Hemp leaves and inflorescences are sources of bioactive compounds used in pharmaceuticals and human foods (
