<p>Karlsson and Martinsson (
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>) observed low growth performance of lambs fed HSC compared to canola meal. For this study, lambs on the HSC diet had a high CP intake with a low ME intake (
 <xref rid="T7" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>). A ME and CP intake balance are required for the animal to gain weight (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Excess CP intake creates an excretion burden, thereby affecting ADG and final live weight (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). However, feeding whole hempseed to steers (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) or HSC to growing cattle (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), and dairy cows (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) did not affect final live weight or ADG. Lack of differences in animal growth when feeding HSC or SBM/canola meal to ruminants could be attributed to their similarity in chemical composition, nutrient intake and digestibility (
