<p>Overall, feeding whole hempseed (14% as fed) and HSC (1.4 kg/animal/day) had neutral effects on carcass and meat quality traits in feedlot steers (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>) and lambs (
 <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>). These findings are consistent with nutrient intake, digestibility, and animal growth data reported for the hempseed by-products in the current review. Similarly, feeding HSC resulted in comparable FA profiles with SBM and canola meal for beef and lamb meat, which was dominated by MUFA (oleic acid; C18:1) (
 <xref rid="T8" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>) and these similarities are related to their dietary FA composition. Overall, HSC has comparable effects compared to SBM on ruminant growth performance, carcass, and physicochemical meat quality attributes. However, no information is available on volatile compounds or sensory attributes of meat from ruminants fed hemp by-products, and this requires investigation.
