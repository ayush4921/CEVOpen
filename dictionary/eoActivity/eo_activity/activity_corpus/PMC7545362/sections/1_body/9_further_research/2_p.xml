<p>Overall, nutrient and bioactive compounds in hemp by-products are biologically accessible in the GIT and available in the animal body system (
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>), but details on their bioavailability are incomplete. These bioactive compounds have been identified in the circulatory system, muscle, and brain tissue, feces and urine in animal models (
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>). Retention of these bioactive compounds in milk has been investigated (
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>), but for meat, it is yet to be determined. If these bioactive compounds are retained in meat, it would be important to determine their efficacy in enhancing keeping and eating qualities of meat. Bioavailability of bioactive compounds of hemp by-products could be determined using 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> digestion, 
 <italic>in-vivo</italic> and/or 
 <italic>ex-vivo</italic> using blood and organs, respectively (
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>). Various techniques have been developed to assess ruminal degradability and intestinal digestibility of feed ingredients 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> (
 <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B132" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>). Distribution of hemp by-products' bioactive compounds among major tissues can also be determined 
 <italic>ex-vivo</italic> using the GC-MS procedure (
 <xref rid="B133" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>). The overall challenge in ruminant production is estimating the transfer of bioactive compounds from hemp by-products into meat and establishing their bioefficacy in improving animal health and production as well as keeping and eating qualities of meat.
