<p>Kuhnle et al. (
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>) reported lignans in beef (6–16 μg/100 g wet weight) and lamb (4–17 μg/100 g wet weight). Ruminal biohydrogenation leads to the conversion of dietary lignans to enterolactones, which are absorbed from the gut and deposited in tissues including milk (

 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>). However, not all phenolics found in the diet are incorporated in similar amounts in meat. Moñino et al. (
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>) observed that among the 11 major phenols identified in rosemary containing diets fed to lambs, only 3 (rosmarinic acid, carnosol, and carnosic acid) significantly increased with dietary inclusion levels of rosemary. Some of the phenolics in the diet are lost in feces or biotransformed before urinary excretion (
