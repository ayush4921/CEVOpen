<p>Information on bioavailability of bioactive compounds is paramount in understanding their intake, digestion, absorption, metabolism, and excretion (
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>). That will, in turn, enable traceability of bioactive compounds and their derivatives in animal products (i.e., meat and milk). Bioavailability entails describing or quantifying the specific nutrient or bioactive available at a target organ/blood circulatory system level (
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>). Bioavailability is an integral process that has five steps which include release from feed matrix in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) (i.e., liberation), absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion.
