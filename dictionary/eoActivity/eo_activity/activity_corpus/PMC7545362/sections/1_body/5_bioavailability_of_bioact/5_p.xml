<p>The α-tocopherol content of meat from steers fed HSC diets was reported to be 2.55 mg/100 g lipid (
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>). Dietary α-tocopherols are non-degradable in the rumen (
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>), hence, availed in the small intestines for absorption and assimilation into adipose tissue and cell membranes to exert antioxidant activities (
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>). Overall, bioefficacy of bioactive compounds is closely related to the amount released from the feed matrix, absorbed, and assimilated into tissues (
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>). In this case, response/efficacy of bioactive compounds in meat derived from ruminants fed hemp by-products diets is closely related to their bioavailability. Understanding bioavailability of hemp by-products bioactive compounds is, therefore, essential in establishing their optimum inclusion levels in ruminant diets that efficiently improve meat production and quality.
