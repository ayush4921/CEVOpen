<p>To date, there is no literature on how digestion of hemp by-products in ruminants affects bioavailability of terpenes, cannabinoids, lignans, and polyphenols (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Overall, terpenes and CBD are volatile compounds easily released from the feed matrix, absorbed and excreted unchanged (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>). Terpenes digestion and absorption begins during mastication and rumination and continues throughout the GIT (

 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). These findings could imply that their metabolism during and/after uptake follows conjugation (phase II) processing with hydrophilic compounds such as glycine and glucuronic acid in the liver (
