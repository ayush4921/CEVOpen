<p>Other phytochemical constituents of hemp by-products include condensed tannins (CT), alkaloids, phenols, lignanamides, and tocopherols (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). The CT are low in hempseed and HSC (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Hemp leaves might contain higher contents of CT since the concentration of bioactive compounds in hemp plant chronologically decreases from flowers, leaves, stems, seed to the roots (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). However, there is no available literature on CT of hemp leaves. Turner et al. (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>) suggested that hempseed by-products contain alkaloids and this was confirmed by Yan et al. (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>), but their contents have not yet been determined.
