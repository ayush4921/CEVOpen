<p>Hempseed is a good source of lignan (320 mg/kg DM) (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). It is dominated by lignanamides (cannabisin A) while HSC and inflorescences are dominated by flavanols (i.e., catechin; 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). More so, 99% of lignans are found in hempseed hulls, hence, dehulled hempseeds and the resultant cake have little lignan (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). Syringaresinol content of hempseed hull (280 mg/kg DM) is the highest of any dietary source (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). Since HSC is produced from hulled seeds, its lignan content is expected to be low. However, there is limited literature on the lignan contents of HSC and leaves.
