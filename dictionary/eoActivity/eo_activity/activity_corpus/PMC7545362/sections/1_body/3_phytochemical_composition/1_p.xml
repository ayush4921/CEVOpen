<p>Hemp has a total of 538 identified bioactive compounds dominated by terpenoids (&gt;120), cannabinoids (&gt;70) and polyphenols (

 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Resin glands on trichomes or head cells of glandular hair are major production sites for terpenoids, cannabinoids, and polyphenols (

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Terpenoids, cannabinoids, polyphenols, and fatty acids (FA) comprise classes of bioactive compounds of great interest in hempseed and its by-products due to their plethora of health-promoting properties (

 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Hence, cleaning and de-hulling of seeds are executed before oil extraction, to minimize cannabinoids transfer into oilseed by-products (

 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) found traces of cannabinoids (i.e., 164.4 mg catechin equivalents (CE)/100 g of feed) in pig diets formulated with whole hempseed. Higher content of cannabinoids in hemp seed extracts is, therefore, a sign of contamination or use of medicinal cannabis varieties (
