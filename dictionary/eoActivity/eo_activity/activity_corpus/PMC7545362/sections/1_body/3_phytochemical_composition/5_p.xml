<p>Fatty acids in hempseed, oil, and cake contain 65–80% PUFA with the major FAs being linoleic (18:2 
 <italic>n</italic>-6) followed by α-linolenic acid (18:3 
 <italic>n</italic>-3) and oleic acid (C18:1 
 <italic>n</italic>-9; 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). This makes hempseed and its by-products an excellent source of essential fatty acids, with an omega 6 to omega 3 fatty acid ratio of ~3.3:1, which is similar to canola oil while providing a more healthful balance than soybean oil (7:1). Phytate (22.5 mg/g) and glucosinolates (3.8 μmol/g) are the most abundant anti-nutritional factors in HSC (
