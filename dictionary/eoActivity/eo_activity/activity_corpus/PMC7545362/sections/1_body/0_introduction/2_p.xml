<p>There are few reports on incorporation of hemp by-products into ruminant diets (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In Europe, inclusion of hempseed cake (HSC) has been restricted to &lt;50 g/kg DM in ruminant diets (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In other jurisdictions such as North America, feeding of hemp by-products awaits approval and will be done based on applications for individual by-products (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). This is partly because of limited data on the bioavailability of dominant bioactive compounds of Cannabis species (i.e., tetrahydrocannabinol, THC, and cannabidiol, CBD) in ruminant animals (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) and the known psychoactive effects of THC in humans (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In addition, there is limited knowledge on the bio-efficacy of these and other bio-actives in a meat matrix (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The present review explores the composition, bioavailability and bioefficacy of hemp by-product nutrients and bioactives in ruminant meat production and preservation. Challenges and opportunities for valorisation of hemp by-products for meat production and shelf life extension are also discussed.
