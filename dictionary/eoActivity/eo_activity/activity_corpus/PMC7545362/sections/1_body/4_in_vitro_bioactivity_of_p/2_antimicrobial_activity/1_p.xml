<p>Essential oil extracts from the whole hemp plant material exhibit antimicrobial activity in most bacterial habitats from human, animal, and food sources, but are active against fungi (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>). Hempseed extracts have antimicrobial inhibitory effect on pathogenic bacterial strains of human origin (
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>). The highest hemp antibacterial activity is found in inflorescences (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>). Inflorescences are sites for the production of majority of bioactive compounds of hemp as they have resin glands (

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). With low THC and CBD contents in hempseed, antibacterial capacity of hempseed by-products could be attributed to terpenes, polyphenols and alkaloids. Terpinolene has been reported to be the main bioactive compound responsible for bacterial inhibitory activity of hemp inflorescence essential oil (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>). Just like other monoterpenes, terpinolene disrupts bacterial cell membrane and wall integrity (

 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>). Generally, monoterpenes interact with bacterial cell membrane phospholipids, which results in increased permeability and leakage of cell content and ultimately cell death (
