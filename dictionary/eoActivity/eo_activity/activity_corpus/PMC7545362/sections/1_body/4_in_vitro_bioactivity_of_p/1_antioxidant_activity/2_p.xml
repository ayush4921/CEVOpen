<p>Phenol amides (i.e.,

 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>) and CBD (

 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>) and Irakli et al. (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>) narrowed this list to 
 <italic>N-trans</italic>-caffeoyl-tyramine, cannabisin A, B, and C as the major antioxidant phenolic compounds of hemp. Furthermore, Izzo et al. (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) confirmed that inflorescent extracts from hemp varieties with a high content of 
 <italic>N-trans</italic>-caffeoyl-tyramine, cannabisin A, and B were more potent antioxidants. Overall, the current review highlights that hemp by-products are a rich and diverse source of potent antioxidants. However, there are still gaps in how this antioxidant potential may influence animal production, meat quality, shelf life, and sensory attributes. Further research is, therefore, required to ascertain their potency and mechanism of action during production, processing, storage/aging, display, and cooking through to consumption.
