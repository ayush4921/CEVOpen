 <italic>In vitro</italic> studies show that hemp has antimicrobial properties (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>) due to its moderate contents of terpenes, CBD, α-tocopherol, and polyphenols, which could be transferred into ruminant meat (
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>). Hempseed increases meat PUFA content (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), which could make it susceptible to lipid oxidation. To authors' knowledge, no studies have evaluated the impact of hemp by-products in ruminant diets on myoglobin, lipid, and protein oxidation. However, feeding HSC increased total antioxidant capacity of sheep milk (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>) owing to the moderate to high terpenes, CBD, α-tocopherol and polyphenol contents in the diet, which are transferable to tissues. Thus, feeding hemp by-products could have positive effects on meat oxidative stability, and merits research.
