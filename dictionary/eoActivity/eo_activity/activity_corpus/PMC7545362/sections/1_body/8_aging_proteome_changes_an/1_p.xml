<p>Proteomics is a relatively new technique in meat science that provides an avenue for understanding meat tenderness and color stability with respect to proteins involved at a molecular basis (

 <xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>). The technique does not only enable identification of myofibrillar proteins, protein, and glycolyticc enzymes involved in meat tenderness and color stability, but also allows establishment of the relationship between these proteins and bioefficacy of meat bioactive compounds (

 <xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>). Nassu et al. (
 <xref rid="B130" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>), for example, found that high muscle Î±-tocopherol content protects meat discoloration at longer aging days (21 d), but does not affect meat tenderness. However, no proteomics was done in this study. The relationships between major meat bioactive compounds in hemp by-products and meat aging have not been investigated. Understanding how these antioxidant bioactive compounds interact with muscle protease system is crucial in establishing their impact on meat quality during aging.
