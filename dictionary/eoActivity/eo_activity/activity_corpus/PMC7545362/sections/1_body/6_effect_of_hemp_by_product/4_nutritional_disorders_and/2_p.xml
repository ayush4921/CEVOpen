<p>Levels of CT in hemp by-products are below recommended (20â€“50 g CT/kg DM) values reported to prevent bloat, acidosis, and parakeratosis (
 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>), except for leaves. CT bind to dietary protein forming complexes thereby reducing protein solubility, hence decreasing the chance of developing a stable rumen foam (
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>). Additionally, CT have a bactericidal effect on bloat causing bacteria such as 
 <italic>Streptococcus bovis</italic>, which produces a dextran slime that increases rumen fluid viscosity, hence, bloating (
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>). CT exert bactericidal effects by binding to plant protein, forming a CT-bacteria cell wall interaction, inhibiting carbohydrate fermentation and proteolytic rumen bacteria (
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>). In turn, CT can also improve conditions for cellulolytic bacteria, and avoid acidosis and parakeratosis (
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>).
