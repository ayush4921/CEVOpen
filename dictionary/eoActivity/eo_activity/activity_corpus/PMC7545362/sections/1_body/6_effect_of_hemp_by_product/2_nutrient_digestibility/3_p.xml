<p>Overall, hempseed oil has lower ruminal fermentation parameters compared to soybean and canola oil (
 <xref rid="T6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). Total volatile fatty acids (VFA) can be as high as 200 mM just after feeding or decrease as low as 30 mM, however, its normal range is 70â€“120 mM (
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>). Low total VFA (37 mM) from hempseed oil could be an indicator of depressed rumen formation. Hempseed oil has a high PUFA content (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), which may have an inhibitory effect on ruminal fibrolytic bacteria (
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>). Hempseed oil reduces ruminal acetate production, which is generally an indicator of decreased fiber digestibility (
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>). Unaffected propionate production is an indicator of little or no influence on carbohydrate degradation (
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>). Hempseed cake has potential to maintain nutrient digestibility when used to replace other high-protein feedstuffs while hempseed oil depresses ruminal fermentation when added at levels &lt;3.0 g/kg DM (
