<p>Terpenes in hemp by-products have antibacterial properties (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>). Specifically, terpinolene and oxygenated monoterpenes have been reported to strongly suppress rumen microbial activity in 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies (
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>). Of importance, ruminal antimicrobial effects of terpenes 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> might be lower than 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> as terpenes are easily absorbed along the entire GIT reducing their concentration (
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>). Inhibitory effect of terpenes on undesirable microbial activity is useful in reducing the rate of ruminal fermentation and degradation to avoid nutritional disorders such as bloat, acidosis, and ruminal parakeratosis (
