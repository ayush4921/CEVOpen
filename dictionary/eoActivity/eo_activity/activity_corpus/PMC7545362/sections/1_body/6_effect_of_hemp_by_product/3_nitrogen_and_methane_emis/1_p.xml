<p>To the authors' knowledge, there are only two studies that evaluated 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> ruminal nitrogen and methane production inhibition of hempseed by-products (
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>). Findings of these studies showed that both whole hempseed and oil had neutral effects on ruminal ammonia-nitrogen production. Whole hempseed was 8% more effective at reducing methane than linseed but comparable to coconut oil (

 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>) recorded a 10% decrease in methane production for hempseed oil compared to corn oil. Methane production reduction is attributed to high PUFA content in hempseed oil, which suppresses protozoa and acts as hydrogen sink through biohydrogenation (
 <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>), with Î±-linolenic acid being a more potent anti-methanogen than linoleic acid (
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>). Whole hempseed is, however, more effective than oil at inhibiting methanogens since it has more terpenes, polyphenols and lignans, which are more toxic to methanogens than PUFA (
 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>). These compounds accumulate in cytoplasmic membranes as they are lipophilic thus disrupting methanogen cell membranes (
