<p>Hempseed cake has a low effective degradability of DM (EDDM) when compared to canola meal and SBM (
 <xref rid="T6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). Dry matter digestibility is likely to be lesser for HSC vs. canola meal and SBM. However, HSC has been reported to increase rumen retention time and improve the rumen environment for microbial degradation as evidenced by fecal consistency scores (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The CP solubility and degradability of HSC is low compared to canola meal and/or SBM (
 <xref rid="T6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). However, potentially degradable protein portion of HSC is higher than canola meal and SBM. The aforementioned aspects result in increased ruminal passage of undegraded dietary protein (UDP). The UDP of HSC is highly digestible in the duodenum as compared to canola meal (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Additionally, UDP and intestinal digestibility of HSC can be increased by moist heat treatment up to 130Â°C (
