<p>A survey by Bamikole and Ikhatua (
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>) indicates hemp leaves have been fed as an appetite stimulant in small ruminants. Feeding HSC either had neutral or positive effects on dry matter intake (DMI; 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). For example, feeding 1 kg or 1.4 kg/animal/day of HSC resulted in an increase in DMI for dairy calves, but not for steers (
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). The DMI increase for the dairy calves was attributed to reduced NDF rumen fill in HSC compared to SBM. Mustafa et al. (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) reported no differences in DMI of lambs fed diets containing 200 g HSC/kg DM, while Karlsson et al. (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and Karlsson and Martinsson (
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>) included HSC in dairy cows (up to 320 g/kg DM) and lambs (218 g/kg DM) diets and recorded an increase in DMI. These inconsistences in DMI could be attributed to different inclusion levels, differences in composition of basal diets and animal species used across studies and deserve further investigation.
