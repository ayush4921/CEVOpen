<p>Although methane production is important in maintaining ruminal environment redox balance by providing a pathway for the excess pyruvate (
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>), it decreases the amount of ME obtained from a diet (
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>), hence, increasing energy required for meat production. The decrease in the concentration of methane produced may reduce atmospheric greenhouse gases and increase feed utilization efficiency as its emissions represent about 10% of gross energy loss from feed intake (
 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>). Thus, reduction in methane emissions might maintain or improve animal performance by conserving energy which is redirected to animal growth (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The limited available 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies on antimethogenic effects of hemp by-products on animal performance warrants further research.
