<p>Metabolisable energy (ME) of HSC ranges from 9.21 to 13.01 MJ/kg DM (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). These values exceed the average requirements for maintenance (i.e., 0.424, 0.401, and 0.497 MJ ME/kg BW
 <sup>0.75</sup>) and growth (0.03, 0.015, and 0.016 MJ ME/g of weight gain) for goats, sheep, and cattle, respectively (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) when HSC fed at 2% BW, hence, HSC could serve well as a ruminant feedstuff. The mineral elements of hemp by-products are lower than ruminant maintenance requirements though the whole seed meets micro-mineral requirements (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Although their mineral content is not well-researched, all hemp by-products except hurds can be used as potential feed ingredients in ruminant diets.
