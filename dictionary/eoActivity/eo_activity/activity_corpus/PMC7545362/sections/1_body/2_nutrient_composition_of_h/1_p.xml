<p>Chemical composition of hemp by-products is largely influenced by variety, pressing, and seed treatment methods (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). However, hemp by-product chemical composition is generally similar to soybean meal (SBM) except for hurds, which contains extremely low CP and ether extract (EE; 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The CP content of hemp by-products is greater than the endorsed dietary requirements for maintenance (60–110 g/kg CP DM) and growth (120–180 g/kg CP DM) of ruminants (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Hemp by-products have a well-balanced amino acid profile comparable to SBM, with tryptophan as a limiting amino acid (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). However, hemp by-products are deficient in growth-limiting amino acids including methionine (1.8 and 2.0% CP) and lysine (6.4 and 6.8% CP) as per the body requirements for goats and cattle, respectively (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). The EE, neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) of hempseed, cake, and hulls are greater than SBM (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The difference in EE content of hemp by-products and SBM could be attributed to the oil extraction method. Solvent extraction has greater oil extraction efficiency than cold press which leaves about 7% of the oil in the cake (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). The EE value of hempseed, cake and hulls is thus about 2.5 times greater than the EE (&lt;50 g/kg DM) recommended for optimal ruminant production (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). This high EE content might affect the inclusion level of hemp by-products in ruminant diets.
