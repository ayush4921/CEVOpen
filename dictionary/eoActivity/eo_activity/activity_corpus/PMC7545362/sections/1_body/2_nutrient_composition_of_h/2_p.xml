<p>High inclusion levels of hemp by-products have been recommended for ruminants based on NDF content (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). More so, hemp by-products are within the recommended dietary NDF content of 150–300 g/kg DM required for optimal ruminant production (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Lignin content of whole hempseed and HSC has been reported to be 112–117 g/kg DM (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). NRC (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) suggested that ruminant dietary lignin content above 40 g/kg DM will probably decrease DM intake and digestibility. High lignin content of HSC could be attributed to the hull (30–46% of seed) remains in the cake during oil extraction (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). More so, hulls contain the highest (65%) fiber portion of the hempseed (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In hempseed, lignin is only found in the hulls (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).
