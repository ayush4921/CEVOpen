<p>Fig 4. The effect of RPLO on the migration rate of MRC-5 cells. (A) Representative image from assay. The wound areas were determined at 0 h and after 24 h of incubation. Control cells were incubated with culture media. Cells incubated with 0.5% of oil were named RPLO. Scale bar is 1 mm. (B) The graph shows the means Â± SEM of three independent experiments performed in triplicate (n= 9). An asterisk (*) indicate statistically significant differences between mean values (one-way ANOVA, Dunnett's post-test, p &lt;0.05). </p>
