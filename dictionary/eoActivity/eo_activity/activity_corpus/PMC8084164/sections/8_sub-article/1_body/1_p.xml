<p>The manuscript PONE-D-20-36667R2 entitled “Rhynchophorus palmarum (Linnaeus, 1758) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae): Guarani Kaiowá indigenous knowledge and pharmacological activities” was reviewed and the authors have addressed all the issues that reviewers had raised. I suggest that the manuscript should be accepted after an additional minor revision.</p>
