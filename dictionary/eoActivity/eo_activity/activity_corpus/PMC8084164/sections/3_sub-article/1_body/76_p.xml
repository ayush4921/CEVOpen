<p>Reviewer #1: The manuscript (PONE-D-20-36667) entitled "Rhynchophorus palmarum Linnaeus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae): Guarani-Kaiowá indigenous knowledge and pharmacological activities" is about the therapeutic use of oils obtained from R. palmarum larvae. The authors determined the chemical characteristics of the obtained oil, and, for the first time, are described its antioxidant and healing properties. They paid a special attention to the Guarani-Kaiowá ethnic community and their knowledge of zootherapy. Submitted manuscript contains some valuable information, so, this interesting research deserves attention having in mind a possibility of vanishing of traditional knowledge and practices over time. Also, the presented results may be of some help in the future development of various pharmaceutical products.</p>
