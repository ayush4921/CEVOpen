<p>In this study, we present the fatty acid composition of RPLO and, for the first time, describe its antioxidant and healing properties. By confirming the pharmacological properties of RPLO, we intend to share this knowledge not only with the scientific community but also with the Guarani-Kaiow√° people to reinforce value to the indigenous TK and prevent this secular knowledge from being lost over time.</p>
