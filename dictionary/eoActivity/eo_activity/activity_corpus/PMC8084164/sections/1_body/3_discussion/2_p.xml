<p>Traditionally, indigenous communities maximize the rational consumption of natural resources. An example of this practice is the method used to obtain 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>palmarum</italic> larvae. Part of the stipes of palm trees felled for the construction of houses is left on the forest floor, at which time the 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>palmarum</italic> beetles lay their eggs. Later, the women return to the forest to collect the larvae. In addition to the use of stipes for building houses and obtaining larvae, the fibers of the palm leaves are used to make nets and as roofs for houses. The traditional method of obtaining 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>palmarum</italic> larvae only occurs in villages with a considerable available area of natural forest. Thus, access to local biodiversity allows the establishment of a permanent ecological balance with adequate management and sustainable extraction to meet the demands of the community.
