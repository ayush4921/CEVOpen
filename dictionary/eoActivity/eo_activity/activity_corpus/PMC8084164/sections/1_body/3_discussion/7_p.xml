<p>The generation of lipid mediators from linoleic acid, such as arachidonic acid and, subsequently, eicosanoids such as prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes, participates in the division and differentiation of epithelial tissue cells [

An increased fibroblast migration rate was also observed after supplementation of the medium with a mixture of vegetable oils [

 <xref rid="pone.0249919.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] observed that a mixture of vegetable oils promoted an inflammatory response controlled by the modulation of the levels of pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines (TNF-Î± and IL-6). This controlled response promoted an improvement in wound tissue healing. These results corroborate the healing properties of other oils, such as pequi and buriti oil, which stimulate the healing of experimental skin wounds in rats [
