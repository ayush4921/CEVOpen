 <xref rid="pone.0249919.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] acids, are very important both for topical application and for ingestion because oxidative damage occurs at both the tissue and systemic levels [

 <xref rid="pone.0249919.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]; however, the antioxidant activity of RPLO was similar to vegetable oils shown to be beneficial to health, such as sunflower, macadamia, linseed, and chia oils [
