<p>The TK is a cultural element of the social, religious, economic, and healthy relationships of indigenous peoples. Within this knowledge, the use of animals for the treatment of diseases is a practice that has been maintained for centuries from generation to generation, particularly through the oral transmission of this knowledge. Changes in the lifestyle of indigenous communities have hindered their abilities to maintain customs that favor orality while increasing access to other means of recording, transmitting, and revisiting this knowledge. The inclusion of indigenous people in universities has allowed knowledge holders to investigate the potential pharmacological properties of traditional medicines. Thus, a Guarani-Kaiow√° woman (the first author of this manuscript) records for the first time the knowledge of the use of RPLO by her community. The present study described the antioxidant activities and healing potential of RPLO and the absence of toxic effects, consistent with its traditional use in wound healing.</p>
