 <italic>palmarum</italic> larvae is performed during the day, mainly by the mothers and grandmothers of the family. As part of the ritual of paying respect to the protectors and the owners of the forest and the animals, the collectors pray before entering the forest. The larvae are collected by opening the stipe of previously felled palm trees with the aid of tools such as a knife and ax (

Importantly, as part of the Guarani-Kaiow√° ritual, the entire process must be performed in silence. The larvae are placed in a container that is placed on the fire; at which time the oil is extracted from the larval carcass. In the village, the extracted oil may be stored together with or without the larval carcasses in closed containers to be used when needed.
