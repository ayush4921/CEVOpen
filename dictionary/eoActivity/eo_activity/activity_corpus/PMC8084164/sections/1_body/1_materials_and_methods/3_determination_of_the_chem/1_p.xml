<p>To evaluate the fatty acid composition of RPLO the transesterification reaction was performed using the method described by Koohikamali et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0249919.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. First, 2.5 ml of a 1 M sodium methoxide (Sigma-Aldrich, São Paulo, Brazil) solution was added to 10 mg of the oil and incubated at 70°C for 30 min. The solution was incubated at room temperature for 3 h. Next, 1.5 ml of ultrapure water were added to the mixture, and the free fatty acids were extracted with 1 ml of hexane, followed by stirring and incubation of the mixture for 15 min. The hexane fraction was collected after the formation of the water: hexane phases. Hexane extraction was performed three times, for a total volume of 3 ml. Subsequently, the hexane fractions were concentrated to a final volume of 1 ml, and 1 μl was analyzed using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS).
