<p>Abs treated cells refer to the samples incubated with RPLO and Abs positive control is the absorbance of the cells incubated only with culture medium. MRC-5 fibroblasts were cultured in 24-well microplates at a density of 8x10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well with DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for 24 h to investigate the ability of RPLO to stimulate cell migration. After the cells had adhered to the plates, the culture medium was aspirated, and a vertical streak was generated in each well with a 1,000-μl pipette tip. Then, the wells were washed with PBS and photographed. Five hundred microliters of DMEM containing 0.5% RPLO were added to each well, and the plate was incubated at 37°C for 24 h. For the control treatment, only the DMEM medium was added, without the addition of RPLO. At the end of the 24-h period, the culture medium was aspirated, and the wells were photographed. Three images of each well were acquired: one in the center of the well and the others at equidistant positions between the middle and the edges of the well, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0249919.s001">S1 File</xref>. The areas to be photographed were marked with a permanent pen to ensure that the images captured at 0 and 24 h were acquired from the same position. The images captured at 0 (after the creation of the wound with the pipette tip) and 24 h were analyzed with ImageJ software and used to calculate the area without cells and consequently the cell migration rate. This assay was performed in triplicate (n = 9), and the results are presented as the wound areas in mm
