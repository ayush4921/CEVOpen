<p>The data were expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Prior to the statistical analysis, Levene´s test of homogeneity of variances was used to assume that variances are equal across groups or samples and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to assess the normality of the data. The mean values of the cell migration rate were analyzed by One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett’s post-test. In in vivo assays, a t-test was used to determine differences between groups. All analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 5 software. The results were considered to be statistically significant at p ≤ 0.05.</p>
