<p>The oil analyzes were performed in a gas chromatograph Shimadzu QP2010 coupled to a mass spectrometer, operating in electronic ionization (EI), using 70 eV ionization energy. An Rtx-5MS chromatographic column (30 m x 0.25 mm, 0.25 mm thick) was used with helium as a carrier gas at a pressure of 91.2 kPa and a flow rate of 1.4 ml.min
 <sup>-1</sup>. The split ratios were 70 and 10 for the transesterification reaction analyzis. For the analysis of the transesterification reaction, the temperature programming was 60°C for 3 min, 60–310°C with increments of 6°C. min
 <sup>-1</sup> and 310°C for 13 min. The databases WILEY 7 and NIST 11 were applied to identify the compounds present in the oil.
