<p>The procedure for extracting RPLO reproduced the traditional method performed in Takuara village. The larvae were thawed overnight in a refrigerator (4°C) and cut into pieces to allow the extravasation of the internal contents. Then, the larvae were heated on a glass plate at a controlled temperature (150°C) for 15 min. During the heating, the larvae were stirred with a glass rod to prevent them from adhering to the glass. At the end of the process, the oil was separated from the carcasses by filtration, its volume was determined, and 15 ml of oil divided into aliquots were obtained (
