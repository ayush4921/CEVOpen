<p>The RPLO acute toxicity test was performed using the method described by Bonamigo et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0249919.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Ten young adult nematodes (L4) were transferred to each well of a 96-well microplate and exposed to 200 μl of M9 medium containing different RPLO concentrations ranging from 1 to 4.5%. The animals were incubated at 20°C for 24 and 48 h. As a negative control, the nematodes were incubated with 200 μl of M9 culture medium. After the incubation period, the viability of the nematodes was evaluated by assessing their sensitivity to touch with a platinum loop. The nematodes were evaluated using a Motic SMZ-140 &amp; W10X/23 stereomicroscope. The results were reported as the means of three independent tests performed in triplicate (n = 30).
