<p>The diluted bacterial suspension (5x10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU.ml
 <sup>-1</sup>) was added to the wells of the microplate containing the Mueller Hinton (MH) culture medium, containing 1% oil (v/v). The bacterial concentration in each well was 5x10
 <sup>5</sup> CFU.ml
 <sup>-1</sup>. An aliquot of the RPLO was prepared in a 0.9% sterile NaCl solution and used to prepare working solutions containing 10% of the RPLO. In each well, 80 μl of MH broth, 10 μl of the oil working solution, and, subsequently, 10 μl of the bacterial inoculum were added, making a volume of oil in the well of 1%. As a positive control of growth inhibition, 80 μl of MH broth, 10 μl of the antibiotic chloramphenicol at a concentration of 4 μg.ml
 <sup>-1</sup> and 10 μl of the bacterial inoculum were added to the well. The concentration of chloramphenicol used in the study represents the minimum bactericidal concentration (BMC). As a negative control of growth inhibition, 80 μl of MH broth, 10 μl of sterile 0.9% NaCl solution, and 10 μL of the bacterial inoculum were added to the well. The experiments were carried out in triplicate (n = 9) through three independent assays.
