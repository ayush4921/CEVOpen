<p>Abs sample refers to the mixture of DPPH with different concentrations of RPLO and Abs negative control is the absorbance of DPPH solution (0.11 mM DPPH in chloroform). The concentration of RPLO required to inhibit 50% (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) the formation of DPPH radical was also determined. The antioxidant activity was determined through the average of three independent experiments carried out in triplicate (n = 9).
