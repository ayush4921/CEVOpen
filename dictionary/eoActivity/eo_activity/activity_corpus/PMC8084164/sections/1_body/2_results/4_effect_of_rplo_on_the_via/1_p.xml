<p>According to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0249919.g003">Fig 3</xref>, the average viability of the control cells and the cells incubated with RPLO, in concentrations between 0.1 and 0.5%, did not differ statistically. RPLO concentrations greater than 0.5% were not analyzed due to changes in turbidity of the medium, which influenced the photometric reading. For this reason, all experiments were carried out with RPLO at a maximum concentration of 0.5%.
