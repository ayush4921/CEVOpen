<p>The antibacterial activity of RPLO was evaluated against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). As shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0249919.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, the oil did not exhibit antimicrobial activity against any bacteria up to the maximum concentration tested (1%). At higher concentrations, the oil interfered with the absorbance reading of the assay. For this reason, higher concentrations were not used.
