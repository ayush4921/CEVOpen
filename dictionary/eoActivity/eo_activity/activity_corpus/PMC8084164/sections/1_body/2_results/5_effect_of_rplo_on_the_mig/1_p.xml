<p>The effect of RPLO on the migration rate of MRC-5 cells was observed at 0 and 24 h after the incubation with RPLO. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0249919.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, at time 0 h, the control and RPLO-treated wells had similar areas, being the empty areas resulted from the removal of the cells. After 24 h, a higher reduction in the exposed area was observed in the wells treated with 0.5% RPLO compared to the control. The cell migration rate was statistically increased by 60% in the wells treated with RPLO compared to the wells receiving the control treatment (
