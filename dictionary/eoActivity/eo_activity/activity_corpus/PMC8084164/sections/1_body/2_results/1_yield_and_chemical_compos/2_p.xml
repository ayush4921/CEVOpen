<p>Saturated and unsaturated fatty acids were identified in the RPLO, which are shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0249919.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The determination of the chemical composition revealed that RPLO comprises saturated (SFA) and unsaturated (UFA) fatty acids, with a slightly higher SFA content. Palmitic (16:0), myristic (14:0) and stearic (18:0) acids were the major SFAs. Oleic (18:1, ω-9), palmitoleic (16:1, ω-7), and linoleic (18:2, ω-6) acids were identified as UFAs, representing the omega-6, -7 and -9 families, respectively.
