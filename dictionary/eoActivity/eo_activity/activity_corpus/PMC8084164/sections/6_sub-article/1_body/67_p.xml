<p>Congratulations to a very interesting work. This big effort will certainly influence others to follow. It will be an important reference. The results and conclusions obtained in this study constitute a clear evidence of the need to conserve and promote the medicinal uses of insects (and animals in general) derived from a deep traditional knowledge. The paper should definitely be published, but it needs a minor revision. Below you will find a series of specific comments and suggestions, and I have just found some typographical errors, typos that I expose.</p>
