<p>Parametric statistics should be used when the assumptions of the models (ANOVA) can be reasonably met. A test of homogeneity of variances (for example, Levene test for homogeneity of variances) must show that in all cases variances were not significantly heterogeneous, as well as a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normal distribution fitting. So, the authors should test data distribution by, for example, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and point it out in Statistical analysis section. This is very important because normal distribution is prerequisite for using ANOVA test.</p>
