My people use the oil extracted from larvae of the snout beetle <italic>Rhynchophorus palmarum</italic> (Linnaeus, 1758) to treat and heal skin wounds and respiratory diseases. Based on this ethnopharmacological knowledge, the chemical composition and antioxidant, antimicrobial, and healing properties of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>palmarum</italic> larvae oil (RPLO) were investigated, as well as possible toxic effects, through <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> assays. The chemical composition of the RPLO was determined using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. The antioxidant activity of RPLO was investigated through the direct 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay, and the antimicrobial activity was evaluated against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria that are pathogenic to humans. The healing properties of RPLO were investigated by performing a cell migration assay using human lung fibroblasts (MRC-5), and the toxicity was analyzed, <italic>in vivo</italic>, using a <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> model and MRC-5 cells, <italic>in vitro</italic>. RPLO contains 52.2% saturated fatty acids and 47.4% unsaturated fatty acids, with palmitic acid (42.7%) and oleic acid (40%) representing its major components, respectively. RPLO possesses direct antioxidant activity, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of 46.15 mg.ml<sup>-1</sup>. The antimicrobial activity of RPLO was not observed at a concentration of 1% (v/v). RPLO did not alter the viability of MRC-5 cells and did not exert toxic effects on <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>. Furthermore, MRC-5 cells incubated with 0.5% RPLO showed a higher rate of cell migration than that of the control group, supporting its healing properties. Taken together, RPLO possesses direct antioxidant activity and the potential to aid in the healing process and is not toxic toward <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> models, corroborating the safe use of the oil in traditional Guarani-Kaiow&#x000e1; medicine.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="3"/><page-count count="17"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the manuscript and its <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec020">Supporting information</xref> files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the manuscript and its <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec020">Supporting information</xref> files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Traditional knowledge (TK) is the result of the secular experience of these communities living among the local biodiversity, their relationship with the environment, and their use of different species for their benefit [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The indigenous Guarani-Kaiow&#x000e1; community is located in the Central-West region of Brazil. Although the practice of zootherapy is common among the Guarani-Kaiow&#x000e1;, records of the species used, the purposes of treatments, and the forms of drug preparation are scarce. Some of the secular knowledge related to zootherapy is transmitted to the younger generation by the <italic>Maxuypy</italic>, the matriarch of the family.

Within this knowledge, the use of animals for the treatment of diseases is a practice that has been maintained for centuries from generation to generation, particularly through the oral transmission of this knowledge. Changes in the lifestyle of indigenous communities have hindered their abilities to maintain customs that favor orality while increasing access to other means of recording, transmitting, and revisiting this knowledge. The inclusion of indigenous people in universities has allowed knowledge holders to investigate the potential pharmacological properties of traditional medicines. Thus, a Guarani-Kaiow&#x000e1; woman (the first author of this manuscript) records for the first time the knowledge of the use of RPLO by her community. The present study described the antioxidant activities and healing potential of RPLO and the absence of toxic effects, consistent with its traditional use in wound healing.</p><p>Traditionally, indigenous communities maximize the rational consumption of natural resources. An example of this practice is the method used to obtain <italic>R</italic>. <italic>palmarum</italic> larvae. Part of the stipes of palm trees felled for the construction of houses is left on the forest floor, at which time the <italic>R</italic>. <italic>palmarum</italic> beetles lay their eggs. Later, the women return to the forest to collect the larvae. In addition to the use of stipes for building houses and obtaining larvae, the fibers of the palm leaves are used to make nets and as roofs for houses. The traditional method of obtaining <italic>R</italic>. <italic>palmarum</italic> larvae only occurs in villages with a considerable available area of natural forest. Thus, access to local biodiversity allows the establishment of a permanent ecological balance with adequate management and sustainable extraction to meet the demands of the community.</p><p>Most of the drugs on the market are derived from plants [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, the list of extracts and molecules isolated from animals is increasing [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0249919.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. RPLO is used by the Guarani-Kaiow&#x000e1; community and other indigenous communities for food [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and medicinal purposes [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The chemical composition of RPLO revealed the presence of saturated [palmitic acid (C16:0), 42.7%], and unsaturated fatty acids [oleic acid (C18:1) [&#x003c9;-9] 40%] in proportions similar to those observed by Due et al. [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Once the chemical composition of RPLO was known, we investigated the pharmacological properties attributed to its major constituents.</p><p>Palmitic acid (C16:0), the main SFA of RPLO, is common in the human diet [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, the excess intake of SFAs increases serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], which is associated with obesity [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], diabetes [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], heart disease, and cancer [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>UFAs have attracted the interest of researchers in the areas of skin cosmetics and food due to their numerous known benefits to human health. The intake of UFAs increases the amount of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], promoting a reduction in LDL levels. Oleic acid (C18:1, &#x003c9;-9, 40% of RPLO), which is abundant in olive oil used in the Mediterranean diet and RPLO, has been described to regulate immune and anti-inflammatory functions [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0249919.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], reduce depressive symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and exert positive effects on the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular, autoimmune and metabolic diseases, and cancer [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Dietary supplementation of diabetic mice with palmitoleic acid (C16:1 [&#x003c9;-7] 6.3% of RPLO) promoted a reduction in body weight, hyperglycemia, and hypertriglyceridemia [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and is an important positive modulator of glucose uptake [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In the study by Souza et al. [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], the intake of palmitoleic acid promoted a reduction in hepatic steatosis and the levels of inflammatory mediators and improved peripheral insulin resistance in mice, attenuating the production of hepatic glucose induced by a high-fat diet [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Linoleic acid (C18:2 [&#x003c9;-6] 1.1% of RPLO), although it is a minor constituent of RPLO, is a precursor of important endogenous fatty acids, such as arachidonic and eicosapentaenoic acids, which have shown cardioprotective properties [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0249919.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and may attenuate the inflammatory process involved in metabolic syndrome, as well as cell adhesion, apoptosis, and cancer [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0249919.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>UFAs, such as those found in RPLO, are components of the three layers of the skin, acting as an important physical barrier [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], or in tissue repair processes after mechanical damage [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Fatty acid deficiency caused skin inflammation similar to atopic dermatitis in hairless mice fed a special diet [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Oleic acid (&#x003c9;-9) is widely used in cosmetic emulsions because it possesses emollient properties, restoring the oiliness of dry and flaky skin [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Besides, oleic acid enhances the permeation of molecules from the stratum corneum of the epidermis towards deeper layers of this tissue without exerting toxic or irritating effects [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Based on these characteristics, several UFAs have been investigated as potential percutaneous carriers of drugs, such as antidepressants, anti-inflammatory agents, and treatments for Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0249919.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>The generation of lipid mediators from linoleic acid, such as arachidonic acid and, subsequently, eicosanoids such as prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes, participates in the division and differentiation of epithelial tissue cells [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and hemorrhage and hemostasis [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Therefore, the participation of essential fatty acids is critical for the maintenance of skin health and in repair processes favoring tissue regeneration [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The addition of RPLO to human fibroblast cultures increased the cell migration rate compared to the control treatment. An increased fibroblast migration rate was also observed after supplementation of the medium with a mixture of vegetable oils [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In addition to the positive effects on the migration rate of fibroblasts, Guidoni et al. [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] observed that a mixture of vegetable oils promoted an inflammatory response controlled by the modulation of the levels of pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines (TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6). This controlled response promoted an improvement in wound tissue healing. These results corroborate the healing properties of other oils, such as pequi and buriti oil, which stimulate the healing of experimental skin wounds in rats [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0249919.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p><p>Another beneficial property of RPLO is its antioxidant activity. Extensive exposure to ultraviolet radiation contributes to premature skin aging [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], increasing the risk of carcinogenic processes in this tissue [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The observed antioxidant activity of RPLO helps to reduce oxidative damage in the skin, particularly the damage responsible for photoaging. Oleic acid has been added to photoprotective and tanning emulsions due to its photoprotective properties, promoting skin regeneration and reducing the damage caused by excessive exposure to sunlight [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0249919.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].</p><p>In addition to the photoprotective properties, the topical application of oils decreases the trauma during dressing replacement, prevents dehydration of the wounded tissue, and functions as a barrier against microorganism invasion into the temporally unprotected tissue [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Based on the results of <italic>in vitro</italic> assays, RPLO does not exert antimicrobial effects on the evaluated bacteria. The absence of direct antimicrobial actions was also described for the oil extracted from the snake <italic>Spilotes pullatus</italic> (Linnaeus, 1758) [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], in contrast to the oil extracted from the Brazilian boa <italic>Boa constrictor</italic> Linnaeus, 1758, [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Thus, further studies of the antimicrobial properties of oils are encouraged.</p><p>The antioxidant properties of the UFAs, namely, oleic [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], linoleic [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], and stearic [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] acids, are very important both for topical application and for ingestion because oxidative damage occurs at both the tissue and systemic levels [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Studies examining the antioxidant activity of oils obtained from insects is scarce in the literature [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]; however, the antioxidant activity of RPLO was similar to vegetable oils shown to be beneficial to health, such as sunflower, macadamia, linseed, and chia oils [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>].</p><p>The consumption of foods considered antioxidants is recommended. However, excess intake of antioxidants may promote pro-oxidant effects [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0249919.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. For this reason, we conducted toxicity studies <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> to investigate the possible undesirable effects of RPLO. RPLO did not alter cell viability or the survival of nematodes exposed to different oil concentrations. The <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> experimental model has been used to evaluate the possible toxic and pharmacological effects of several substances [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Although it is a simpler model than the human organism, several homologous genes and molecular pathways related to development, resistance to different stressors, reproduction, and aging are shared [<xref rid="pone.0249919.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0249919.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>].

The authors determined the chemical characteristics of the obtained oil, and, for the first time, are described its antioxidant and healing properties. They paid a special attention to the Guarani-Kaiow&#x000e1; ethnic community and their knowledge of zootherapy. Submitted manuscript contains some valuable information, so, this interesting research deserves attention having in mind a possibility of vanishing of traditional knowledge and practices over time.

</p><p>Dear editor,</p><p>We are very grateful for the comments raised during the review process. We would like to make it clear that all suggestions have been analyzed and the manuscript has been modified. The responses to each survey were entered as &#x02018;&#x0003e; response&#x02019;.</p><p>Reviewer #1: COMMENTS FOR AUTHORS</p><p>The manuscript (PONE-D-20-36667) entitled "Rhynchophorus palmarum Linnaeus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae): Guarani-Kaiow&#x000e1; indigenous knowledge and pharmacological activities" is about the therapeutic use of oils obtained from R. palmarum larvae. The authors determined the chemical characteristics of the obtained oil, and, for the first time, are described its antioxidant and healing properties. They paid a special attention to the Guarani-Kaiow&#x000e1; ethnic community and their knowledge of zootherapy. Submitted manuscript contains some valuable information, so, this interesting research deserves attention having in mind a possibility of vanishing of traditional knowledge and practices over time. Also, the presented results may be of some help in the future development of various pharmaceutical products.</p><p>Unfortunately, I cannot recommend accepting the manuscript in its present form.</p><p>Following are some comments and questions raised during the review of the text.</p><p>Significant revision of English scientific writing is needed.</p><p>ABSTRACT</p><p>Abstract is concise and contains factual information.</p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>In the Introduction, the authors stated the objectives of their work that are supported by appropriate facts.</p><p>MATERIALS AND METHODS </p><p>The experiments are well designed and performed. But, some parts of Material and Methods section need a bit more details. Specifically, these issues are highlighted:</p><p> Obtaining R. palmarum larvae oil</p><p>In Supplementary material S1, the method of collecting larvae is already described in detail. </p><p>Line 93-94 The authors mentioned that the larvae were collected in Takuara village. </p><p> When this procedure was conducted? How many larvae were collected?</p><p>Line 98 &#x0201c;...larvae were washed with distilled water, dried with paper towels, weighed, and frozen...&#x0201c;</p><p>What were the temperatures that larvae were kept on, until the beginning of the experimental procedure?</p><p>&#x0003e; In this version of the manuscript we added further information regard the process of oil obtainment, informing the number of larvae, temperature of storage and further details requested. </p><p>Determination of the chemical composition of RPLO</p><p>Line 124 &#x0201c;...followed by stirring and incubation of the mixture&#x0201c;</p><p> The time of incubation?</p><p>&#x0003e; We inserted in this version of the manuscript the time of incubation (15 min).</p><p>Antioxidant activity of RPLO</p><p>In formula for DPPH percentage, Abs sample is the absorbance of the sample and Abs control is the absorbance of control? Please, provide clarifications.</p><p>&#x0003e; We appreciate this observation and now, we included more information about the formula.</p><p>Line 149-150 &#x0201c;The results of three experiments performed in triplicate were used to determine the antioxidant activity.&#x0201c;</p><p>How many samples were in each experiment?</p><p>&#x0003e; This was another important observation raised by referee. We included more details about this topic, informing that three independent assays. In each assay, we used triplicates for each oil concentration (n=3). Thus, each assay was carried out with n= 3. The sum of three independent assays resulted in a total samples of n= 9.</p><p>Antimicrobial activity of RPLO</p><p>Line 176 &#x0201c;The experiments were carried out in triplicate. &#x0201c;</p><p>How many samples were in each of this triplicates?</p><p>&#x0003e; In each assay, we used triplicates for each oil concentration (n=3). Thus, each assay was carried out with n= 3. The sum of three independent assays resulted in a total samples of n= 9 (3 assays using a 3 samples)</p><p>Cell culture, viability, and migration</p><p>Please, provide clarifications for Abs treated cells and Abs control cells.</p><p>&#x0003e; We appreciate this observation and now, we included more information about the formula.</p><p>Statistical analysis</p><p>Parametric statistics should be used when the assumptions of the models (ANOVA) can be reasonably met. A test of homogeneity of variances (for example, Levene test for homogeneity of variances) must show that in all cases variances were not significantly heterogeneous, as well as a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normal distribution fitting. So, the authors should test data distribution by, for example, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and point it out in Statistical analysis section. This is very important because normal distribution is prerequisite for using ANOVA test.</p><p>&#x0003e; We thank the referee regards this so important observation. In this version of the manuscript, we carried out further statistics analyses, such as suggested. So, we included the test of homogeneity of variances (Levene) and for normal distribution (KS test). Since non-significant values were obtained, we continued using ANOVA.</p><p>RESULTS </p><p>Antimicrobial activity of the RPLO</p><p>Please, see the Table 3. Did you mean MIC and MBC, instead of CIM and MBC?</p><p>&#x0003e; These mistakes were corrected.</p><p>Effect of RPLO on the viability of MRC-5 cells</p><p>Maybe, it would be better to rephrase this section. E.g., at given concentrations, cell viability was in what range? Compare to the control, which concentration of RPLO the most changes the viability of MRC-5 cells?</p><p>&#x0003e; This section was rewritten to improve the clarity.</p><p>In legend of Fig 4, please mention the number of samples. n= 9?</p><p>&#x0003e; The mention regards the n=9 was included.</p><p>Effect of RPLO on the migration rate of MRC-5 cells</p><p>Line 299 "As shown in Fig 5A&#x02026;" instead of "As shown in Fig 5&#x02026;"</p><p>Line 302-304 Please, rephrase the sentence. Maybe, something like the following: The cell migration rate was statistically increased by 60% in the wells treated with RPLO compared to the wells receiving the control treatment (Fig. 5B).</p><p>&#x0003e; Based in observation of referee, we modified the section, improving the clarity of suggested sentences.</p><p>Figure 5. Legend should be rewritten. It should be as clear and concise as possible. In addition,</p><p>please mention the number of samples. Was it 9?</p><p>&#x0003e; Actually, the legend contained excessive sentences. This mistake was corrected, and the number of samples was included in this version.</p><p>Toxicity of RPLO in a C. elegans model</p><p>In legend of Fig 6, please mention the number of samples. n= 10?</p><p>&#x0003e; This was a good comment. This assay contains a n= 90, formed by triplicates containing 10 worms/well (n= 30). Once the assay was carried out three times independently, the number of 90 was obtained. </p><p>DISCUSSION</p><p>Please improve this section. The discussion should be clearly and concisely presented. Namely, the same things are repeated in several paragraphs &#x02013; e.g. see lines 369-371 and 388-391; lines 402-408 and 418-425&#x02026;</p><p>&#x0003e; We included modifications in discussion topic in order to make more conscious. However, in some points different approaches were necessary. So, whenever possible we improved the section.</p><p>REFERENCES</p><p>Please, check this section once again.</p><p>&#x0003e; We made corrections and addition of further references in this version.</p><p>Reviewer #2: COMMENTS FOR AUTHORS</p><p>Congratulations to a very interesting work. This big effort will certainly influence others to follow. It will be an important reference. The results and conclusions obtained in this study constitute a clear evidence of the need to conserve and promote the medicinal uses of insects (and animals in general) derived from a deep traditional knowledge. The paper should definitely be published, but it needs a minor revision. Below you will find a series of specific comments and suggestions, and I have just found some typographical errors, typos that I expose.</p><p>Title</p><p>Page 10 / line 1&#x02026; Rhynchophorus palmarum (Linnaeus, 1758) (Coleoptera:...</p><p>&#x0003e; We included in this version the correct taxonomic mention to C.

For this reason, the expression &#x02018;my people&#x02019; was considered pertinent. The changes in lines 25 and 32 were carried out.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>Page 12 / line 24&#x02026; Traditional knowledge&#x02026; the authors mention (they write) this concept numerous times. I think it is possible to use the abbreviation TK from this point on.</p><p>&#x0003e; We appreciate the important observation. Along the manuscript we used the abbreviation TK replacing the expression Traditional knowledge.</p><p>Page 12 / line 24&#x02026; species for their benefit (1).

</p><p>The manuscript PONE-D-20-36667R2 entitled &#x0201c;Rhynchophorus palmarum (Linnaeus, 1758) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae): Guarani Kaiow&#x000e1; indigenous knowledge and pharmacological activities&#x0201d; was reviewed and the authors have addressed all the issues that reviewers had raised. I suggest that the manuscript should be accepted after an additional minor revision.</p><p>We would like to thank Dr. Jos&#x000e9; Antonio Gonz&#x000e1;lez for taking care of the smallest details that will certainly enrich our manuscript. Below are the responses to the surveys, which are marked in blue.</p><p>Minor comment:</p><p>The Material and Methods section has been greatly improved. But, Statistical analysis description could be a bit more precise, something like this: </p><p>The data were expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard error of the mean (SEM). Prior to the statistical analysis, Levene&#x000b4;s test of homogeneity of variances was used to assume that variances are equal across groups or samples and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to assess the normality of the data. The mean values of the cell migration rate were analyzed by One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett's post-test. In in vivo assays, a t-test was used to determine differences between groups. All analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 5 software. The results were considered to be statistically significant at p &#x02264; 0.05.</p><p>&#x0003e; We appreciate the suggestion, in this version the manuscript the section Statistical analysis was rewritten observing the improvement of clarity.</p><p>Also, Figure legends would be rewritten, e.g.</p><p>Fig 3. Viability of MRC-5 cells incubated with different concentrations of RPLO for 24 h. The graph shows the means &#x000b1; SEM of three independent experiments performed in triplicate (n= 9). The observed changes were not statistically significant (t-test).</p><p>Fig 4. The effect of RPLO on the migration rate of MRC-5 cells. (A) Representative image from assay. The wound areas were determined at 0 h and after 24 h of incubation. Control cells were incubated with culture media. Cells incubated with 0.5% of oil were named RPLO. Scale bar is 1 mm. (B) The graph shows the means &#x000b1; SEM of three independent experiments performed in triplicate (n= 9). An asterisk (*) indicate statistically significant differences between mean values (one-way ANOVA, Dunnett's post-test, p &#x0003c;0.05). </p><p>Fig 5. Acute toxicity of RPLO in the C. elegans experimental model in vivo. Viability was recorded at (A) 24 h and (B) 48 h of treatment. The graph shows the means &#x000b1; SEM of three independent experiments performed in triplicate (n= 90). The observed changes were not statistically significant (t-test).</p><p>&#x0003e; The same care regards the previous appointment was took in consideration, in order to become the Figure legends clear.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0249919.s006"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to Reviewers.doc</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0249919.s006.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article id="pone.0249919.r007" article-type="editor-report"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0249919.r007</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 3</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>&#x00160;iler</surname><given-names>Branislav T.</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2021 Branislav T. &#x00160;iler</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2021</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Branislav T. &#x00160;iler</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article id="rel-obj007" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0249919" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
