<p>Glucose homeostasis is a multi-faceted process in which the liver has an important role, being capable of storing or releasing glucose. In diabetic patients, a decreased glycogen synthesis coupled with increased gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis are detected, which lead to elevated blood glucose. Therefore, stimulation of glucokinase and more importantly glycogen synthase is capable of reducing hyperglycemia by stimulating the conversion of glucose into glycogen. The 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> study of 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Ibrahim et al. (2019)</xref> proved that essential oil from 
 <italic>Citrus x aurantiifolia</italic> (Christm.) Swingle presented a hypoglycemic effect in an alloxan-induced diabetes model. In this study, intraperitoneal administration of 100 mg/kg EO to diabetic rats for 14 days, significantly reduced fasting blood glucose levels, decreased hepatic glucose production, and increased hepatic glycogen, suggesting that reduction of gluconeogenesis and augmentation of glycogenesis are the main mechanism of action of the essential oil. On the other hand, a new 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> study showed that oral administration of 
 <bold>geraniol</bold> a natural monoterpene found in several essential oils, in doses between 100 and 400 mg/kg, to STZ-induced diabetic rats for 45 days, reduced plasma glucose, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C). The analysis of liver tissue from the treated rats proved that geraniol was capable of inhibiting hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase activity, thus reducing gluconeogenesis (

Also, other three studies found that citronellol, d-limonene, and caryophyllene inhibited both glucose-6-phosphatase and fructose-1-6-phosphatase, reducing gluconeogenesis in STZ-induced diabetic rats, with a significant reduction of plasma glucose and HbA1C (
