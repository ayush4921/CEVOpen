<p>Excessive production of VLDL in which fatty acid synthesis plays an important role is involved in dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome. A key enzyme in the process is fatty acid synthase (FAS) which is regulated by complex nuclear mechanisms. An 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> study investigating the effects of essential oil from 
 <italic>Melissa officinalis</italic> L. in APOE2 transgenic mice proved a decrease of plasma triglycerides by inhibiting fatty acids synthesis. The obtained data showed that the treatment with essential oil inhibited the nuclear translocation of Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Protein-1c (SREBP-1c) which in turn led to the suppression of key genes involved in lipid metabolism, primarily fatty acid synthase (FAS). The study did not investigate which of the essential oil active constituents could be responsible for this effect (
