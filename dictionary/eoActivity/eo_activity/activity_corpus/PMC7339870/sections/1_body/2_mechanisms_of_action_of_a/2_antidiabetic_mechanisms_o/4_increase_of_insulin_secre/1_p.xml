<p>An increase of insulin secretion could be achieved by depolarizing beta cell membrane by modulating potassium channels or by protecting beta cells against aggression and apoptosis. An

 <bold>menthol</bold>, present in the chemical composition of several essential oils, administered orally to STZ-induced diabetic rats in doses of 25 to 100 mg/kg for 45 days, reduced blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C). The substance showed a mechanism of action similar with sulphonylurea drugs, being able to inhibit ATP-sensitive K channels on beta cells membrane, increasing the exocytosis of insulin. Additionally, menthol increased the survivability of beta cells by stimulating the expression of Bcl-2, an antiapoptotic factor (

 <italic>Mentha x piperita</italic> L. also increased the expression of Bcl-2 and hence protected pancreatic beta cells against apoptosis in a STZ-induced diabetes model in rats.
