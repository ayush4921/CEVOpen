<p>This review identified sixteen essential oil-bearing plant species from Balkan region with antidiabetic and antihyperlipidemic effects demonstrated in preclinical and clinical studies. The main mechanisms of antidiabetic effect of individual chemical components identified in the selected species were represented by an inhibition of α-amylase and α-glucosidase by cuminaldehyde, 1,8-cineole, and thujone, a decrease of gluconeogenesis by geraniol and an increase of insulin sensitivity by eugenol or insulin secretion by menthol. Activation of lipoprotein lipase by camphene and thymol and modulation of TRPV1 receptor by eugenol were considered responsible for the antihyperlipidemic effect. The active terpenoid components identified in the chemical composition of the studied essential oils could become promising new drug candidates, but future studies are needed in order to evaluate their potential.</p>
