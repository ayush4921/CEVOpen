<p>Previous reviews investigated the antidiabetic effects of natural compounds and medicinal plants. An extended study screened 
 <italic>in silico</italic> a library of over 2,300 compounds derived from 30 common herb species, showing that liquorice, hops, fennel, and rosemary are a reach source of antidiabetic compounds like flavonoids and alkaloids (

Our data confirmed some of the findings from these studies, demonstrating that α-amylase, α-glucosidase or glucose-6-phosphatase are effective molecular targets not only for the mentioned phytochemical classes but also for essential oils, equally capable of reducing blood glucose in a variety of experimental models.
