<p>Six of the presented essential oils-bearing plants (fennel, cumin, lemon balm, rosemary, black cumin, and lemon) have also proved a priorly discussed antidiabetic activity, the co-existence of antidiabetic and antihyperlipidemic properties being a possible advantage in the development of new drug candidates. The presented data showed that predominantly, antihyperlipidemic effect of essential oil was evaluated using 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments in which dyslipidemia was induced either by a cholesterol-enriched diet or by the administration of Triton WR1339, an inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase which favors the accumulation of VLDL lipoproteins (

In both models, the administration of the mentioned essential oils decreased the concentration of total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides. A study evaluated also the aortic intima thickness an important parameter in cardiovascular diseases, noting favorable effects after the administration of lemon essential oil for 8 weeks (

The administration of lemon balm essential oil produced in these animals a decrease of plasma triglycerides by inhibiting fatty acids synthesis following a down-regulation of Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Protein-1c (SREBP-1c) (

 <italic>in vitro</italic> using HepG2 cells, in which treatment with lemon balm and mastic tree essential oils reduced intracellular cholesterol biosynthesis. Due to the complexity of cholesterol metabolism, further studies are necessary to understand the molecular basis of antihyperlipidemic effect of essential oils.
