<p>The analysis of the aforementioned studies showed that the majority of experimental models used for the assessment of antidiabetic effect of essential oils were 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> techniques (10 studies from 16). Among these, alloxan and streptozotocin-induced diabetes methods were preferred, being capable of reproducing the destruction of pancreatic beta-cells from diabetes with subsequent hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance. Alloxan enters the pancreatic beta cells where it suppresses ATP-mediated insulin release while streptozotocin alkylates the DNA of beta cells inducing their necrosis (

 <italic>db/db</italic> mice which can also reproduce some of the pathological features of diabetes mellitus. These mice have a mutation in their leptin receptor, with the subsequent development of insulin resistance and obesity which was partially corrected by the administration of lemon balm essential oil (

 <italic>in vitro</italic> techniques for evaluating the effect of essential oils on important enzymes from glucose metabolism like α-amylase or α-glucosidase which are involved in the release of glucydic fractions in the digestive system (

Although the experimental models used for the study of antidiabetic essential oils are quite diverse, having generated important data, further studies using additional techniques are necessary, for a more accurate evaluation.
