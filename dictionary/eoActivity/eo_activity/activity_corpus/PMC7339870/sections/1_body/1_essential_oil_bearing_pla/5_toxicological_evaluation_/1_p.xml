<p>Essential oils are characterized by a high content in monoterpenes, compounds with low molecular weight and high lipophilicity which enable them to easily pass through biological barriers and potentially affect multiple organs. Despite their promising impact for health sciences, only a few studies investigated the toxicological aspects of essential oils with antidiabetic and antihyperlipidemic potential and their main chemical constituents. A study on female Wistar rats evaluated the repeated oral toxicity of essential oil from 
 <italic>Cuminum cyminum</italic> L. and found no evidence of clinical signs of toxicity or pathological modifications at organ level, defining a non-observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of 500 mg/kg/day (

Another study evaluating the sub-chronic toxicity of DL-menthol in male B6C3F1 mice, also found no clinical signs or histopathological evidence of toxicity and established a NOAEL of 1956 mg/kg/day. In male Fischer 344 rats, the same study did not demonstrate significant signs of toxicity for DL-menthol, calculating a NOAEL of 937 mg/kg/day (

 <italic>in vitro</italic> method using isolated rat hepatocytes, which demonstrated that an exposure to high doses of this compound present in several essential oils can cause significant hepatotoxicity, attenuated by acetylcysteine, showing some similarity with paracetamol intoxication (
