 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and combining the network topology parameters, it can be found that PPARG is the key target in the PPARG signalling pathway, and the corresponding compound is apigenin. Although STAT1 and HSP90AA1 have no direct targets, SCST indirectly affects PPARG, STAT1 and HSP90AA1 to exert anti-fibrosis effects through XDH, which is also closely related to liver fibrosis. The PDB codes of the above key targets (PPARG (3vso), XDH (3uni)) were searched for and sorted out from the RCSB PDB website. Schrodinger molecular docking technology is used for docking, and the interaction between these targets, the surrounding key amino acids and the binding of their target proteins at the active site are shown in Fig.
