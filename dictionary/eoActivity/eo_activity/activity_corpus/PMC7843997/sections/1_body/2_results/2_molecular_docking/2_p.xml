<p id="Par22">The molecular docking results showed that the five compounds docked well with their corresponding proteins. The surrounding key amino acids mainly played a role in the formation of hydrogen bonds, aromatic bonds and hydrophobic bonds and the co-crystallized surrounding amino acids within the receptor protein itself (RCSB Protein Data Bank website) were basically the same; combined with Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, the docking energy values are relatively small, indicating that the compound can stably bind to the receptor protein and play a role.
