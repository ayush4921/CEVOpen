<p id="Par23">In order to identify the activated phenotype of LX-2, the mRNA level of the pro-fibrotic marker α-SMA and the presence of cytoplasmic lipid droplets were analysed by a qRT-PCR assay and Oil Red O staining, respectively. Compared with quiesced LX-2 cells cultured with 2% FBS, upregulated 
 <italic>α-Sma</italic> and decreased oil red O staining were found in activated LX-2 cells cultured with 10% FBS. In addition, treatment with 20 µM of the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone markedly suppressed 
 <italic>α-Sma</italic> expression and increased oil red O staining (Fig.
