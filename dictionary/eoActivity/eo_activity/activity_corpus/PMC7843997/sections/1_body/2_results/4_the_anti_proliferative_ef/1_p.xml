<p id="Par24">To evaluate the anti-hepatic fibrosis of SCST, 36 ingredients collected from SCST, including 13 predicted key compounds based on the network pharmacology analysis, were investigated for their anti-proliferation effects on LX-2 cells with the MTT assay. The chemical structures and results of the flavonoids in SCST are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, and the results of the other compounds are shown in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>. Of the 37 compounds tested, 18 exhibited anti-proliferative activity in LX-2 cells in the concentration range of 12.5–200 μM, in which eleven compounds were flavonoids (
 <bold>3, 4, 5, 12, 13, 14, 17, 19, 20, 21, 26)</bold> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), accounting for 61% of the total compounds, two were terpenoids, corosolic acid (
 <bold>30</bold>) and ursolic acid (
 <bold>33</bold>), which displayed the strongest anti-proliferative activity, and others were iridoids, steroids, etc. Furthermore, we found that the presence of a single C
 <sub>4</sub>′–OH in the flavonoids could be the most important feature for the anti-proliferative effects; for example, apigenin (
 <bold>21</bold>) showed the strongest anti-proliferative activity among all flavonoids. In addition, the presence of a C
 <sub>3</sub>–OH, C
 <sub>3</sub>′–OH, or C
 <sub>4</sub>′–OCH
 <sub>3</sub> group produced some negative effects on the activity, for example, diosmetin (
 <bold>4</bold>), isorhamnetin (
 <bold>5</bold>), diosmetin (
 <bold>4</bold>) and apigenin (
 <bold>21</bold>). The C
 <sub>3</sub>′–OH group could have the greatest interference on the activity; for example, luteolin (
 <bold>3</bold>) and 
 <bold>21</bold>. Interestingly, most of the glucose groups had no contribution to activity, but the glucose group at C
 <sub>4</sub>′ increased the anti-proliferative activity when a C3′–OH was present; for example, in luteolin (
 <bold>3</bold>) and luteolin-4′-O-glucoside (
 <bold>19)</bold>.
