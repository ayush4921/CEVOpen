<p id="Par16">Network pharmacology is a powerful tool for studying the medicinal properties of complex natural products. According to the filters previously described, a total of 73 SCST components were selected as candidates for further investigation, including 27 flavonoids, 11 phenylpropanoids, 18 terpenoids, 4 iridoids, 4 coumarins, 3 aromatic acids, 2 steroidal acids and 4 other compounds. We obtained 403 candidate targets that were targeted by the above 73 components (total frequency of 1723). By mapping the candidate targets to the 66 known genes associated with hepatic fibrosis obtained from OMIM and DrugBank, 10 co-targets were found, including HSP90AA1, PPARG, MAPT, HSP90AB1, STAT1, and PPARA. Based on these results, the network of SCST “compound-target-interacting proteins” was constructed using Cytoscape 3.5.2 software, as shown in Fig.
