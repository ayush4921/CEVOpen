<p id="Par30">Furthermore, the protein levels of PPARG, STAT1 and p-STAT1 in each group treated with 50 μM flavonoids and rosiglitazone were analysed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, compared with the control group, 50 μM of each rhoifolin 
 <bold>(12),</bold> hyperin 
 <bold>(13)</bold>, and kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside (
 <bold>14</bold>) and 20 μM rosiglitazone effectively increased the expression of PPARG (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01 or 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Activated STAT1 is tyrosine- and serine-phosphorylated. It then forms a homodimer and migrates into the nucleus to drive the expression of its target genes

 </sup>. Treatment with 50 μM isoorientin (
 <bold>17),</bold> luteolin-4′-O-glucoside (
 <bold>19</bold>) or hyperin 
 <bold>(13)</bold> significantly increased the ratio of p-STAT1/STAT1 (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01 or 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05), and most of the flavonoids tested at 50 μM showed an upward trend in the expression of PPARG and the ratio of p-STAT1/STAT1.
