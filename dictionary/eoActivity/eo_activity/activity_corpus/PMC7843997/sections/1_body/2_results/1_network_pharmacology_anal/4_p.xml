<p id="Par19">The co-targets are closely related to liver diseases, and in the 
 <italic>degree</italic> order, the top four included heat shock protein 90AA1 (HSP90AA1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor G (PPARG), heat shock protein 90AB1 (HSP90AB1), and signal transduction and transcriptional activator 1 (STAT1). STAT has 6 family members, STAT1-STAT6. Among them, STAT1 is a negative regulator of liver fibrosis, which can inhibit the activation and proliferation of HSCs and promote the killing ability of NK on activated HSCs

 </sup>. PPARG, which is a member of the PPAR family, is mainly expressed in adipose tissue and the liver. By regulating the expression of related genes, PPARG can correct liver lipid metabolism disorders, reduce oxidative stress, reduce the fibrotic cytokine α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) in HSCs and is essential for both adipocyte differentiation and HSC quiescence

 </sup>. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are also known as stress proteins and are divided into the HSP70 family, HSP90 family, HSP100 family, and some small heat shock proteins. Among them, HSP90 is a class of molecular chaperone proteins. Some studies have found that HSP90 inhibitors can induce HSC apoptosis through neurophospholipase or NF-κB depending on the mechanism

 </sup>. Therefore, we selected HSP90AA1, PPAR and STAT1 as the final targets to verify the hepatoprotective effects of SCST in preparation for subsequent mechanistic research.
