 <bold>(12),</bold> kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside (

 <bold>17)</bold> at a concentration of 50 μM and luteolin (3)
 <bold>,</bold> isoorientin (
 <bold>17)</bold> and kaempferol at 12.5 μM effectively promoted the expression of 
 <italic>Pparg</italic>, with the effect of isoorientin (
 <bold>17)</bold> being the most prominent. Second, luteolin (3)
 <bold>,</bold> diosmetin (
 <bold>4</bold>), rhoifolin 
 <bold>(12)</bold> and kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside (
 <bold>14</bold>) at a concentration of 50 μM and diosmetin (
 <bold>4</bold>), rhoifolin 
 <bold>(12),</bold> hyperin 
 <bold>(13)</bold> and kaempferol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-rutinoside (
 <bold>14</bold>) at 12.5 μM effectively promoted the expression of 
 <italic>Hsp90aa1</italic>, with 12.5 μM diosmetin (
 <bold>4</bold>) being the most effective. Moreover, 50 μM kaempferol significantly increased the expression of the 
 <italic>Stat1 gene</italic> by approximately 70%
 <italic>,</italic> whereas luteolin (
 <bold>3</bold>)
 <bold>,</bold> diosmetin (
 <bold>4</bold>), and isorhamnetin 
 <bold>(5)</bold> dramatically reduced the expression of the 
 <italic>Stat1 gene</italic> and showed the opposite profile. Treatment with 20 µM rosiglitazone resulted in the downregulation of PPARG but there were no pronounced effects on the 
 <italic>Hsp90aa1</italic> and 
 <italic>Stat1</italic> genes. The effects of many natural products on biological activity are multifaceted, and many natural products show activation at low concentrations and inhibition at high concentrations, or vice versa. Pparg and Stat1 play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis, but there is an upstream or downstream relationship between the two. For example, in this experiment, the effect of kaempferol on the upregulation of STAT1 is better at high concentrations than at low concentrations, while the downregulation of PPARG was better at high concentrations than at low concentrations.
