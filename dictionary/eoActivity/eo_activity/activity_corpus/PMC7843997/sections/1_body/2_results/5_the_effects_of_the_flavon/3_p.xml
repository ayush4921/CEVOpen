<p id="Par29">Based on the above results, we found that the coexistence of C
 <sub>3</sub>′–OH and C
 <sub>4</sub>′–OH groups in these flavonoids could be the most important factor for upregulating the expression of the 
 <italic>Pparg</italic> gene; if one of these moieties is lost or C
 <sub>3</sub>′-OH is replaced by a hydroxymethyl, the effects of compounds will be weakened; for example, in the cases of luteolin (
 <bold>3</bold>), apigenin (
 <bold>21</bold>)
 <bold>,</bold> and diosmetin (
 <bold>4</bold>) (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Compared with the coexistence of the two hydroxyl groups on the B ring, the presence of a rhamnoside at C
 <sub>6</sub> further upregulated 
 <italic>Pparg</italic>, for example, with isoorientin (
 <bold>17)</bold> and luteolin (
 <bold>3</bold>) (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01)
 <bold>.</bold> Moreover, the coexistence of C
 <sub>4</sub>′-OCH
 <sub>3</sub> and C
 <sub>3</sub>′-OH in diosmetin (
 <bold>4</bold>) exhibited the optimum efficiency in upregulating the 
 <italic>Hsp90aa1</italic> gene; if C
 <sub>4</sub>′-OCH
 <sub>3</sub> was replaced by a hydroxyl, the effect of upregulating the 
 <italic>Hsp90aa1</italic> gene would be weakened; for example, with luteolin (
 <bold>3</bold>). Furthermore, the presence of a C
 <sub>3</sub>-OH could play the most negative role of flavonoids in upregulating the 
 <italic>Hsp90aa1</italic> gene; for example, with diosmetin (
 <bold>4</bold>) and isorhamnetin 
 <bold>(5)</bold> at 50 μM (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05)
 <bold>,</bold> and a glucose group instead of a hydrogen at C
 <sub>3</sub> could alleviate the negative effects from the C
 <sub>3</sub>–OH; for example, with kaempferol, hyperin 
 <bold>(13)</bold>, and kaempferol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-rutinoside (
 <bold>14</bold>) (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01 or 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). In contrast, the presence of a C
 <sub>3</sub>–OH and a single hydroxyl on the B ring could be the most important features of the flavonoids in upregulating the 
 <italic>Stat1</italic> gene. For example, kaempferol showed the strongest stimulating activity to upregulate the 
 <italic>Stat1</italic> gene among all flavonoids, and a glucose group instead of a hydrogen at C
 <sub>3</sub> or the presence of alone at C
 <sub>4</sub>′-OH without a C
 <sub>3</sub>-OH would lead to a reduced ability to upregulate the 
 <italic>Stat1</italic> gene; for example, with kaempferol, hyperin 
 <bold>(13),</bold> and apigenin (
 <bold>21</bold>) (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01 or 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05).
