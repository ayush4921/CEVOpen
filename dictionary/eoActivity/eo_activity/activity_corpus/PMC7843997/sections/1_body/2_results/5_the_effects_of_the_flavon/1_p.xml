<p id="Par27">To verify the results of the network analysis and explore the structure–activity relationship of the flavonoids in SCST, the gene expression of the key co-targets HSP90AA1, PPARG and STAT1 in each group was detected by qRT-PCR. Moreover, based on a previous screening of SCST blood components, kaempferol (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A), a metabolite of isorhamnetin (
 <bold>5</bold>) and kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside (
 <bold>14</bold>), was added for further study
