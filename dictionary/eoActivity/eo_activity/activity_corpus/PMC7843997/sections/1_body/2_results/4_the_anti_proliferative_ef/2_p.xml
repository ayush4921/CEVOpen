<p id="Par25">It is worth noting that the seven phenylpropanoids of SCST, including 1,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid (
 <bold>9</bold>), isochlorogenic acid C (
 <bold>10</bold>), isochlorogenic acid B (
 <bold>11</bold>), chlorogenic acid (
 <bold>22</bold>), isochlorogenic acid A (
 <bold>24</bold>), neochlorogenic acid (
 <bold>29</bold>) and caffeic acid (
 <bold>36</bold>), exhibited significant pro-proliferative activity in the concentration range of 12.5–400 μM in LX-2 cells, and these compounds are derivatives of one or two chlorogenic acids bound to caffeic acid at different positions. Except for 
 <bold>9</bold>, their pro-proliferative activity was positively correlated with their concentration, and the chemical structures and results of these SCST phenylpropanoids are shown in Supplementary Fig.
