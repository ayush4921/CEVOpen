<p id="Par26">Combined with the results of network pharmacology, we think that these flavonoid derivatives with similar nuclear structures may be responsible for most of the anti-proliferative activity of SCST. Therefore, we further explored the relationship between the flavonoids of SCST and the key targets predicted via network pharmacology analysis.</p>
