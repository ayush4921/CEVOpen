<p id="Par32">To systematically explore the pharmacodynamic advantages of SCST on liver fibrosis, we employed network pharmacology combined with an experimental verification approach to identify the active ingredients and molecular mechanisms of SCST. Our results demonstrated that SCST could target HSP90AA1, PPARG, HSP90AB1, STAT1, etc., further regulating the PPARG signalling pathway that is closely related to liver fibrosis, and the flavonoids and phenylpropanoids of SCST are important ingredients against hepatic fibrosis. The proliferation and activation of HSCs is the key stage of hepatic fibrosis. In our results, all of the tested flavonoids exhibited anti-proliferative activity against HSCs, and in contrast, all but one of the phenylpropanoids displayed significant pro-proliferative activity. Ganbold and colleagues demonstrated that isorhamnetin and 3-
 <italic>O</italic>-methylquercetin had stronger inhibitory effects on the proliferation of rat hepatic stellate cells (HSCs-T6) and suggested that methyl groups at the C-3′ and C-3 positions may have functional roles in exerting biological activity

 </sup>. He et al. also showed that chrysin, luteolin, apigenin, hesperetin and 3′,4′-dimethoxyhesperetin suppress hepatocyte apoptosis and apparently have hepato-protective effects against acute liver failure induced by lipopolysaccharide/
 <sc>d</sc>-galactosamine. In addition, they suggested that the C2-3 double bond on the A ring and a hydroxyl group at C3′ or C4′ on the B ring increase the protective activities; however, hydroxymethylation at C3′ and C4′ reverses the activity

 <sub>3</sub>-OH, C
 <sub>3</sub>′-OH, and C
 <sub>4</sub>′-OCH
 <sub>3</sub> groups produced some negative effects on the activity of the flavonoids. In addition, apigenin had the optimal anti-proliferative effect, which is consistent with He’s report
