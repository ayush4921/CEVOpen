<p id="Par31">SCST has been used in Mongolian medicine to treat liver diseases, and the ingredients of SCST mainly consist of flavonoids, phenylpropanoids and iridoids. Accumulating data have demonstrated that different types of compounds in SCST seem to have distinct roles in treating liver diseases. It has been shown that the flavonoid-rich aqueous extract of SCST can attenuate liver fibrosis by selectively inhibiting Smad3 phosphorylation to downregulate the transcription of fibrotic genes in a rat model of CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis or in TGF-Î²1-activated HSCs. Our early observations also suggest that the majority of constituents that migrate to the blood from the SCST ethanol extract are flavonoids and phenylpropanoids

In addition, the plant extracts were demonstrated to have excellent anti-HCV activity, and the phenylpropanoids chlorogenic acid and 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid showed significant anti-HCV activity
