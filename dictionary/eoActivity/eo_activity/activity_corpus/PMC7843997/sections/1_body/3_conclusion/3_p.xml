<p id="Par33">The results of network pharmacology were verified by qRT-PCR and WB technology. This indicates that the majority of SCST flavonoids regulate the expression of the 
 <italic>Hsp90aa1</italic>, 
 <italic>Pparg</italic> and 
 <italic>Stat1</italic> genes and show an upward trend in the expression of PPARG and the ratio of p-STAT1/STAT1. It appears that the relationship between the gene expression of 
 <italic>Stat1</italic> and structure have the opposite trend of 
 <italic>Hsp90aa1</italic> and 
 <italic>Pparg</italic>. Collectively, these observations suggest that the anti-proliferative activity of these flavonoids in LX-2 cells could be associated with regulation of the expression of the 
 <italic>Hsp90aa1</italic>, 
 <italic>Pparg</italic> and 
 <italic>Stat1</italic> genes and the PPARG, p-STAT1, and STAT1 proteins.
