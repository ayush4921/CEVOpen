 </sup>. LX-2 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup>/well and incubated for 24 h before the addition of the stimulus. For identification of the activated phenotypes, LX-2 cells were cultured with 10% FBS (for aHSCs) or 2% FBS (for qHSCs) for 48 h, subsequently treated or not for 24 h with 20 µM of the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone (RSG) (Sigma, R2408), and then fixed with 16% formalin in PBS for 0.5 h. Oil Red O (0.5% w/v in isopropanol) (Solarbio, G1262) was diluted with a 67% volume of water, filtered, and added to the fixed HSCs. Images were randomly captured using an objective lens (10 ×) in 3 different sections. After removing the staining solution, the dye retained in the cells was eluted into isopropanol, and the optical density (OD) was measured with a microplate reader (ThermoFisher Multiskan FC, USA) at 510 nm.
