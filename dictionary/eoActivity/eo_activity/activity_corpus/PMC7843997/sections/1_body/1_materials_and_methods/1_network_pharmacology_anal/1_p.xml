Excluding the essential oil, compounds that met the properties for oral bioavailability (OB) (≥ 20%), drug-likeness (DL) (≥ 0.18) and Lipinski’s rules or that have definite pharmacological activity were selected as candidate ingredients. The chemical structures of the SCST ingredients were drawn with ChemBioDraw 14.0 and transformed into Mol2 format. Swiss (
