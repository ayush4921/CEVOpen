<p id="Par12">LX-2 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup>/well. After incubation at 37 °C for 24 h, the cells were treated with 36 monomers of SCST in the dose range of 12.5–400 μM for another 24 h. Detailed information on these 37 SCST monomers is listed in Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>. Cell viability was evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay as previously described. Treated cells were incubated with a 10% MTT solution at 37 °C for 4 h, the supernatants were removed, and the formazan crystals were dissolved in 150 µl of DMSO per well. The absorbance was measured on a microplate reader at 490 nm. The relative percentage of cell viability was expressed as a percentage of that of the control cells.
