<p id="Par14">Cell samples were homogenized with cell lysis buffer for Western blotting and IP (1% PMSF) (Beyotime, P0013; Biosynthesis Inc, C05-01002) for 30 min. Total protein from the samples was separated by 10% SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and then transferred to nitrocellulose blotting (NC) membranes. After blocking with 5% non-fat milk for 1 h at room temperature, the membranes were incubated with rabbit monoclonal anti-STAT1 (1:1000, CST:#14994, USA), PPARG (1:1000, CST:#2443, USA), P-STAT1 (1:1000, CST:#9167, USA) and rabbit anti-GAPDH (1:1000, CST: #2118, USA) primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C and then incubated with secondary antibodies (1:2000, BOSTER: BA1054, China) at room temperature for 1 h. The bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescent ECL reagents (Absin Bio: abs920, China). GAPDH was used as an internal control.</p>
