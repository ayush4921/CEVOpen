<p id="Par8">Through the analysis of the above-mentioned Network Analyser plug-in and the prediction results of DAVID, the important signal pathways/key targets and main active components in the treatment of liver fibrosis in the network were analysed, and the SCST components were molecularly docked with the corresponding target proteins. Key proteins and their co-crystals were screened and downloaded from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (

Water molecules were deleted, polar hydrogen atoms were added, and the loop structure was complete. The Schrodinger molecular docking program was used to study the molecular docking between the compound and the active site of the target structure. Discovery Studio 2016 Client is was to analyse the Schrodinger docking results to investigate the binding mode and the binding free energy of the compound and the corresponding target to determine the affinity of the compound for the target.
