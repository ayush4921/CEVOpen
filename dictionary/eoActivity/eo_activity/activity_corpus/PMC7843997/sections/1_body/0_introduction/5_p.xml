<p id="Par6">In the present study, we employed integrated network pharmacology to profile a network map of bioactive ingredients and molecular targets for the anti-hepatopathy mechanism of SCST. Then, 36 components of SCST, mainly flavonoids, phenylpropanoids and iridoids, were assessed for their activity and verified targets with HSCs closely related to liver fibrosis. To our knowledge, this is the first study to reveal the comprehensive results of the active ingredients and molecular mechanisms of SCST in vitro and to indicate that SCST has multi-targeted and multi-component synergistic anti-hepatic fibrosis effects.</p>
