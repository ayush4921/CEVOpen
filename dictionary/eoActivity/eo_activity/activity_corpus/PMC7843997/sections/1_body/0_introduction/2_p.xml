<p id="Par3">In the normal liver, quiescent HSCs (qHSCs) are lipid-containing cells that store retinoids and express higher levels of lipid-related genes, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG). Under chronic liver injury, qHSCs are transformed into activated hepatic stellate cells (aHSCs) and gradually lose their fat-storing phenotype
