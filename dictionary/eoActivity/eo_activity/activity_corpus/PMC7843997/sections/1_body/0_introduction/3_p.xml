 </sup> that SCST showed some pharmacological actions, such as fever relief, anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, renal ischaemia reperfusion injury protection, platelet aggregation inhibition, conscious sedation, and immune function enhancement. SCST was found to be rich in flavonoids, triterpenoids, iridoids, coumarins, organic acids and volatile oils. To date, our team has isolated and identified 22 compounds from SCST, including the new compound tschilliensisin and the first isolated components, β-sitosterol and luteolin

The possible metabolic pathways of these constituents involved sulfation, glucuronidation, demethylation, hydroxylation, and so on
