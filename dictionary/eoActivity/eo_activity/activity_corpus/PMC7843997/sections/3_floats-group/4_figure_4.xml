  <p>Lipid droplets and the mRNA expression levels of the fibrotic marker α-SMA in LX-2 cells. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Lipid droplets in LX-2 cells were stained by Oil Red O and quantitatively detected. Oil red O staining in activated LX-2 cells significantly decreased, while staining markedly increased after the addition of 20 µM of the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3). Arrows refer to the stained lipid droplets. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Compared with quiesced cells, the mRNA level of α-SMA in activated LX-2 cells increased, while the 
   <italic>α-Sma</italic> gene was conspicuously suppressed by 24 h of treatment with 20 µM rosiglitazone (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3). Mean values ± SD are presented.
