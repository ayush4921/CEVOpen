<p>Based on the evidence-based review on the use of medicinal plant from the plant family of Asteraceae and Lamiaceae in cardiovascular diseases, we hope that information from this review will facilitate future research initiatives to develop new medicinal plant-based medication for cardiovascular disease treatment or continue with any clinical studies to prove the effectiveness of this medicinal plant upon humans. The clinical trial needs to be performed to have a better knowledge of their safety and efficacy to ensure that it can be beneficial to the human race.</p>
