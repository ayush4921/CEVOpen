<p>The last few decades have witnessed several rapid changes in the traditional use of the medicinal plant in developing countries. However, some of the traditional use of the medicinal plant is undocumented that results in the decline of knowledge and making it unreliable. Therefore, it has become necessary to document the knowledge and shared them entirely to ensure their quality and preservation. Based on this review, medicinal plants were widely consumed using decoction or taken orally as a raw product of fruits, leaves, and roots. Most of the plants from Asteraceae and Lamiaceae family are rich in flavonoids and terpenoids, together with other phytochemicals that act as the inducer of the mechanism in alleviating cardiovascular diseases. The plants have a strong antioxidant effect, followed by anti-hyperlipidemic, vasodilation, antithrombotic, and diuretic effects which are mechanisms that are closely related in resolving cardiovascular diseases such as coronary heart diseases (CHD), atherosclerosis, hypertension, and others. As the medicinal plant being beneficial for treating human ailments, we should not waste these resources by leaving them to grow wild and perish, without utilizing them for better pharmaceutical development in the future.</p>
