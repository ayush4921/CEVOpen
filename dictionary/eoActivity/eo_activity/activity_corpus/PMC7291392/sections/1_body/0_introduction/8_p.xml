<p>Medicinal plants are currently being used in developing a new hypertension drug, and one of them is 
 <italic>Marrubium vulgare</italic> L. from Lamiaceae plant family. The crude oil of the plant was examined its hypotensive effect, and due to the presence of diterpenoids in the plant, it has potential cardiovascular activity, which was caused due to relaxation of vessels and reduces systolic blood pressure which are the mechanisms involved in hypertension (

 <italic>Cynara cardunculus</italic> L. (syn. 
 <italic>Cynara scolymus</italic> L.) from the Asteraceae plant family, which is also known as an artichoke. It is one of the oldest medicinal drugs for its cardiovascular effects. It exhibits a lipid-lowering effect and inhibits the biosynthesis of cholesterol (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Fintelmaan, 1996</xref>). These drugs prove that medicinal plants can be developed into drugs or for as a treatment for therapeutic purposes. New drugs from the available medicinal plant can treat the disease more efficiently, as a safer and more efficient drug can be discovered in the future, which may benefit the patient (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Bardai et al., 2001</xref>). Based on the traditional uses and the developed drug, it showed that the plant families have a high potential in alleviating cardiovascular diseases. Thus, an in-depth compilation of the activity and mechanism of the plant family on cardiovascular diseases needs to be examined.
