<p>A review on phytochemistry and pharmacological of medicinal plants related to cardiovascular diseases specifically on 
 <italic>Asteraceae</italic> and 
 <italic>Lamiaceae</italic> family were conducted by using searching engines such as Google Scholar, Scopus, ScienceDirect, ProQuest, Karger, and Molecule. The literature taken range from the year 1979 to 2018 and was evaluated and tabulated in this review. The keywords used during searching includes “cardiovascular diseases,” “coronary heart disease,” “stroke,” “myocardial infarction,” “hypertension,” “heart failure,” “antioxidant,” “anti-hyperlipidemia,” “antithrombotic,” “medicinal plants,” “plants,” “herbs,” “
 <italic>in vivo,”</italic> “
 <italic>in vitro”</italic> alone and in different combinations. This review specifically focuses on the identification and collection of the information on medicinal plants from the Asteraceae and Lamiaceae family, with proven 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> or 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies upon cardiovascular diseases.
