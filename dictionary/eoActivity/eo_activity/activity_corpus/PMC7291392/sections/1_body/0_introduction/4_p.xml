<p>Stroke is a heterogeneous disease, which includes the hemorrhage of cerebral and the pathogenic subtypes of ischemic stroke (

One of the main causes of stroke is due to blood coagulation. When the clotting blood accumulates in the blood vessel, the blood refuses to flow to the brain, and the brain tends to be lack of oxygen that leads to ischemic stroke. In this condition, an anticoagulant will avoid the blood from clotting and allow the ease of blood flow throughout the body and brain from the heart. Based on these regards, plants with anticoagulant activity will help treat cardiovascular diseases of these mechanisms.
