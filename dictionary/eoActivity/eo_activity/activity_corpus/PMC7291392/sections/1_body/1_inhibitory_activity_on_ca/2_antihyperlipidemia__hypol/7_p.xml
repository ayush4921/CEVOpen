The methanolic extract in a concentration of 150 and 300 mg/kg were administered orally to the rats. As a result, the extract increased HDL-C level while reduced VLDL-C, LDL-C, total cholesterol, and triglycerides levels compared to the positive group. The extract in a concentration of 300 mg/kg showed potent antihyperlipidemic activity compared to the positive control group (
