 <italic>Achillea tenuifolia</italic> Lam. is known for its free radical scavenging activity. The ferric thiocyanate test was conducted to determine the antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>A. tenuifolia</italic> extract (ATE) by measuring peroxide concentration during the early stage of lipid peroxidation (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Ardestani and Yazdanparast, 2007</xref>). ATE concentration of 200 and 400 µg/mL suppress the lipid peroxidation by the extension on the lag phase and the reduction of the propagation rate, which reflects the typical chain-breaking antioxidant characteristics. The activity was determined using a linoleic acid system. The peroxidation activity was measured using the thiocyanate method by using the absorbance at 500 nm to determine the peroxide values. The study showed that the ATE contained 55 mg ascorbic acid equivalents per gram of extract with the EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 55 µg/mL (
