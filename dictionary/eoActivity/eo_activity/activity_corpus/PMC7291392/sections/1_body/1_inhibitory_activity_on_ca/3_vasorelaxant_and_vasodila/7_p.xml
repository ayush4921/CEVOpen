 <italic>Orthosiphon</italic> aristatus (Blume) Miq. contains sinensetin 
 <bold>(17)</bold>, which is essential for vasorelaxation activity (
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">Yam et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">Yam et al., 2018</xref>). The studies measured the vasorelaxant effect of the compound by conducting a pre-contraction aortic ring assay. The presence of antagonists has shown the mechanism of the vasorelaxant effect of sinensetin 
 <bold>(17)</bold>. Sinensetin 
 <bold>(17)</bold> had exhibited a relaxation effect of potassium chloride-induced endothelium-intact aortic rings and phenylephrine-induced aortic ring with or without the endothelium. The study showed that sinensetin 
 <bold>(17)</bold> exhibited a vasorelaxant effect 
 <italic>via</italic> antagonization of aortic ring contraction through direct and indirect vasorelaxation. The pathways that were involved in this vasorelaxant activity were NO/sGC/cGMP pathways. Sinensetin 
 <bold>(17)</bold> at a dose of 0.262 Âµg/mL caused the vasodilatory effect (
