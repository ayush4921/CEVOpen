 <italic>Leuzea carthamoides</italic> Willd. DC. consists of eriodictyol 
 <bold>(21)</bold> and patuletin 
 <bold>(22)</bold>, which have similar antiplatelet activity (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Koleckar et al., 2008</xref>). The leaf parts of the plant exhibited antiplatelet activity by inhibiting arachidonic acid and collagen-induced platelet aggregation. It showed a more potent antiplatelet activity in the collagen-induced aggregation compared to the arachidonic acid-induced aggregation. The mechanism that was exhibited by eriodictyol 
 <bold>(21)</bold> is the decrease in antiplatelet potency that was caused by glucosylation process. Based on the study, apigenin and quercetin formed from the glycosylation process exhibited a lesser activity compared to their aglycons (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Guerrero et al., 2005</xref>). Based on the study, the extract of the 
 <italic>L. carthamoides</italic> has a potent antithrombotic effect due to the presence of the antithrombotic agents, not due to the effect of the specific flavonoids that are present in the extract. The plant had shown a strong inhibition activity upon the platelet aggregation that was induced by adenosine diphosphate (ADP) (
