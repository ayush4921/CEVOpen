<p>The methanolic extract of 
 <italic>A. melampodina</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>deserti</italic> (Boiss.) Eig in the concentration of 25, 50, and 100 µg/mL showed more significant DPPH radical scavenging activity, compared to the positive controls, 
 <sc>l</sc>-ascorbic acid, and butylated hydroxytoluene, BHT (
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">Shahat et al., 2014</xref>). The DPPH radical scavenging activity and chelating effect of the plant were concentration-dependent. The plant extract at the concentration of 400 µg/mL showed a 100% chelating effect. The ferrous ion chelating effect of the extract was measured to determine the capacity of the extract to bind to the ferrous ion to catalyze oxidation in lipid peroxidation. The extract also possessed superoxide anion radicals scavenging capacity. It has a potent anion scavenging power at each concentration tested with a range from 25 µg/mL to 400 µg/mL (
