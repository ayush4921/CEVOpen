 <italic>Artemisia absinthium</italic> L. methanolic (MAB) extract at the concentration from 25 to 100 Âµg/mL showed scavenging activity on superoxide anion radicals produced from the PMS-NADH system (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Bora and Sharma, 2011</xref>). When the MAB was administered orally at doses of 100 or 200 mg/kg, it restored superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) levels and decreased the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) level. As a whole, it causes inhibitory activity on oxidative stress induced by cerebral ischemia and reperfusion. GSH is known as a central component in the antioxidant and known as the defense cells. It acts by detoxifying ROS directly and as a substrate for various peroxides (
