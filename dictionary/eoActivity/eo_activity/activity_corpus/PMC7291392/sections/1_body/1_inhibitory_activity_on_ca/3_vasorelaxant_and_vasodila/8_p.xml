<p>The vasodilatory effect of essential oil of the 
 <italic>Pectis brevipedunculata</italic> Sch. Bip aerial parts (EOPB) was identified (
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">Pereira et al., 2013</xref>). The essential oil is rich with citral content, which consists of neral 
 <bold>(18)</bold> and geranial 
 <bold>(19)</bold>, followed by limonene and α-pinene. The vasodilator activity of EOPB and citral was measured using aortic rings obtained from Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats. EOPB and citral exhibited relaxation to the phenylephrine-induced endothelium-intact aortic rings with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.044 ± 0.006% and 0.024 ± 0.004%, respectively. Meanwhile, EOPH and citral exhibited relaxation to the phenylephrine-induced denuded aortic rings with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.093 ± 0.015% and 0.021 ± 0.004%, respectively. The extract mechanism of activity was through the NO/cyclic GMP pathway. Meanwhile, the citral mechanism of activity was by blocking voltage-dependent L-type Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> channels that reduced calcium influx. The high concentrations of EOPB caused vasorelaxation of endothelium-independent which predominated the endothelium-dependent pathway (
