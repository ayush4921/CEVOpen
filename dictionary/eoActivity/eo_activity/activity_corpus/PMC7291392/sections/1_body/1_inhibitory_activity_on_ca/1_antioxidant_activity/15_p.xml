 <italic>Senecio ovatus</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>stabianus</italic> (Lacaita) Greuter was used an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assay to examine its antioxidant activity by conducting azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonate) (ABTS) and DPPH assay (
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">Tundis et al., 2012</xref>). The study showed that the ethyl acetate extract of the plant exhibited the strongest activity on ABTS (IC
 <sub>50</sub> value: 32.7 mg/mL) and DPPH (IC
 <sub>50</sub> value: 35.5 mg/mL) assay. Based on the Folin-Ciocalteu method, the plant contains total phenol of 76.3 mg chlorogenic acid 
 <bold>(11)</bold> equivalent per gram of the plant. Whereas, based on the formation of the flavonoid-aluminum complex method, the plant contains a total flavonoid of 11.8 mg quercetin 
 <bold>(3)</bold> equivalent per gram of the plant. Thus, it was assumed that the antioxidant activity of the plant due to its flavonoids content (
