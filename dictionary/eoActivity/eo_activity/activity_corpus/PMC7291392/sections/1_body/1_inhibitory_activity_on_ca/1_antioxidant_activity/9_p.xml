 <italic>Dracocephalum moldavica</italic> L. contains antioxidant compounds with cardioprotective effects (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>). The total ﬂavonoid extract (5 µg/mL) from 
 <italic>D. moldavica</italic> pre-treatment had caused improvement in the heart rate and coronary ﬂow by decreasing lactate dehydrogenase levels, creatinine kinase levels, and caused a rise on left ventricular developed pressure. In the concentration of higher than 70 mg/L, the total flavonoid extract exhibited a higher DPPH radical scavenging activity than vitamin E. The study showed that 
 <italic>D. moldavica</italic> exhibited protection against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion(I/R)-induced injury by enhancing GSH/GSSG ratio and SOD activity and attenuating malondialdehyde (MDA) production (

 <italic>H. leucocephalum</italic> Ausfeld aerial parts showed an antioxidant effect 
 <italic>via in vitro</italic> assay. The extract exhibited antioxidant activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 69.94 ± 0.17 μg/mL. The high amount of phenolic compounds from this plant showed a sufficient antioxidant activity in the DPPH assay (
