<p>Flower extract of 
 <italic>Chrysanthemum</italic> x 
 <italic>morifolium</italic> Ramat. Hemsl. exhibited a vasodilatory effect by reducing the blood pressure of cardiac hypertrophy rats (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2016</xref>). The major phytochemicals in this extract are 4,5-di-caffeoylquinic acid, 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid, luteolin-7-β-glucoside, 3-chlorogenic acid 
 <bold>(11)</bold>, and apigenin-7-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside. A range of 75 to 150 mg/kg extract was fed to the rats for four weeks to study the effect of the extract on the rats’ SBP. The dose of 150 mg/kg showed a reduction in the SBP, which was about 4% by the second week. One month administration of the extract caused a reduction in the serum-free fatty acid (FFA) by 18.9% to 29.8%, and myocardial FFA level by 5.4% to 16.0%. In addition to the extract activity in inhibiting myocardial hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) expression, the extract also caused subsequent modulation of some peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα)-mediated gene expression; a decreased in the glucose transporter-4 (GLUT-4) protein expression and an increased in the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 (PDK-4) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1a (CPT-1a) protein expression.
