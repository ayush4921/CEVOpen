<p>Marrubiin 
 <bold>(20)</bold> was isolated from 
 <italic>Leonotis leonurus</italic> (L.) R. Br., and both were tested 
 <italic>via in vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies to determine their anticoagulation reaction (
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">Mnonopi et al., 2011</xref>). The marrubiin 
 <bold>(20)</bold> and the plant extract suppressed the inflammatory markers, platelet aggregation, and coagulation marker while prolonged aPTT. The extract and marrubiin 
 <bold>(20)</bold> in the concentration of 100 µg/mL were administered on rats. It was observed that the platelet adhesion was reduced in a dose-dependent manner, together with a depletion in protein secretion, fibrin formation, and d-dimer. The intracellular levels of Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> were also reduced in a concentration-dependent manner and inhibited the calcium mobilization that was induced by thrombin by 50 to 200 µg/mL. This study shows that marrubiin 
 <bold>(20)</bold> and the extract may have a direct inhibitory effect upon the synthase activity of cyclooxygenase or thromboxane due to the suppression of thromboxane B2 production (
