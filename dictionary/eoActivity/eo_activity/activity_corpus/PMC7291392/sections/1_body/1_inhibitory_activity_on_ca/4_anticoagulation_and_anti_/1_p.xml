<p>A series of zymogens are involved in the blood coagulation process. Proteolysis caused the conversion of zymogens into active enzymes that caused the production of thrombin, which can lead to the conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin (
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">Rand et al., 1996</xref>). Enzymes are involved in mediating the blood coagulation of damaged tissues. Factor VII (FVII) binds to uncovered tissue factor (TF), which triggers the development of thrombin that causes coagulation of blood. Anticoagulant inhibits thrombin generation and fibrin formation. An ideal clinical anticoagulant should inhibit thrombin activity without induced bleeding. Platelets and other mediators play an important role in thrombosis and cardiovascular diseases. Based on reported studies, few plants from the plant family of Asteraceae and Lamiaceae plant family possess an anticoagulant effect. The plants’ species from the family of Asteraceae are
