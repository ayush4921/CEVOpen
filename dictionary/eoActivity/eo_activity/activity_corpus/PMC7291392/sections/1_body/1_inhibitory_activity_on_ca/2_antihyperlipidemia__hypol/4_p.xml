 <italic>In vivo</italic> study of methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>Ageratum conyzoide</italic> L. root, leaf, and stem were carried out on rats to examine its hypolipidemic activity (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Atawodi et al., 2017</xref>). The extracts contain flavonoids, alkaloids, cardiac glycosides, triterpenes, saponins, carbohydrates, and tannins. Meanwhile, the leaf also consists of steroids. Fiber, saponins, and flavonoids have an underlying antihyperlipidemic effect. The methanolic extract in a concentration of 100 mg/kg was treated on rats. The extract reduced serum lipids, which is one of the insulin-releasing factors. Insulin inhibits lipolysis, thus causing a rise in uptake of fatty acids into adipose tissue and triglyceride synthesis. The diabetic rat had shown a significant reduction in total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (cardioprotective lipid) levels (
