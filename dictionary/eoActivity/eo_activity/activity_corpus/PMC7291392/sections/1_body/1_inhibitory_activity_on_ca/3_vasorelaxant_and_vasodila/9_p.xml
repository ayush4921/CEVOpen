 <italic>Phlomoides bracteosa</italic> (Royle ex Benth) Kamelin and Makhm. has few phytochemicals which had the vasorelaxant effects, which are marrubiin 
 <bold>(20)</bold>, phlomeoic acid, and new components (RA and RB) (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Khan et al., 2012</xref>). The whole plant was powdered and extracted using methanol to produce its extract and examined its activity using rat thoracic aorta. The EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 23.4 and 36.7 μg/mL of marrubiin 
 <bold>(20)</bold> had shown a relaxant effect upon the phenylephrine-induced contraction and inhibited the K
 <sup>+</sup>. Marrubiin 
 <bold>(20)</bold> in the concentration of 3.0 to 10 μg/mL induced rightward shift of the Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> channels. Marrubiin 
 <bold>(20)</bold>, phlomeoic acid, and RA exhibited a more potent effect against K
 <sup>+</sup>-induced contractions, compared with phenylephrine, which indicated that it had a greater efﬁcacy in blocking the voltage-sensitive Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> channels. Among all four phytochemicals studied, the marrubiin 
 <bold>(20)</bold> was most potent for its vasodilator activity. It can be used in further studies to test its extent of vasodilation activity in the future (
