The oil consisted of 22.7% oxygenated sesquiterpenes with caryophyllene oxide (3.4%), T-cadinol (5.1%) and eudesma-11-en-4a-ol (7.0%) as the main compounds. The essential oil, especially, at a concentration of 500 Âµg/mL, exhibited strong antioxidant activity by causing a reduction in DPPH concentration which is comparable to ascorbic acid activity due to the presence of carvacrol, 3-methoxymoquinone, and thymol (
