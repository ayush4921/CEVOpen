 <italic>Chromolaena odorata</italic> (L.) R. M. King and H.Rob. leaves aqueous extract was examined its atherogenic indices and plasma lipid profiles on rats that have fed loaded with cholesterol (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Ikewuchi and Ikewuchi, 2011</xref>). The intra-gastric gavages of the plant extract (100 mg/kg body weight) was administered to the rats. As a result, there was a significant reduction in total cholesterol, LDL, non-HDL, VLDL, and plasmaâ€™s triglyceride levels. The HDL-C level in the plasma was high once being treated with the extract. The extract contains saponin, which was reported to have a hypercholesterolemic activity (
