 <italic>Agastache mexicana</italic> (Kunth.) Lint. and Epling is a medicinal plant species from the Lamiaceae family that can treat hypertension and anxiety conditions. The antihypertensive activity of the dichloromethane extract of 
 <italic>A. mexicana</italic> (DEAm) and its isolated compound, ursolic acid were determined in the male rat (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Flores-Flores et al., 2016</xref>). The extract exhibited relaxant activity on noradrenaline bitartrate 0.1 ÂµM and potassium chloride (KCl) 80 mM pre-contracted aortic rings which suggest that the extract exhibited vasodilation effect through several receptors, such as the augment of free cytosolic Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>levels. The extract inhibited the vasoconstriction caused by noradrenaline bitartrate and potassium chloride (

Ursolic acid evoked a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) with no change in the hypertensive rat. This action was due to its diuretic effect in relieving the hypertension condition (
