<p>Based on the previous studies of Asteraceae and Lamiaceae plant species, the number of plant species that exhibits diuretic effects is lesser than those other mechanisms, such as antioxidants, antihyperlipidemic, and vasorelaxant. The plant species that possess diuretic effect from the Asteraceae family are 
 <italic>Chamaemelum nobile</italic> (L.) All.
 <italic>, Chrysanthemum</italic> x 
 <italic>morifolium</italic> Ramat. Hemsl., and 
 <italic>Tanacetum vulgare</italic> L. and the plant species from Lamiaceae family are 
 <italic>Ajuga integrifolia</italic> Buch.-Ham. ex D. Don (syn. 
 <italic>Ajuga remota</italic> Benth.)
 <italic>, Anisomeles indica</italic> (L.) Kuntze, and 
 <italic>Plectranthus amboinicus</italic> (Lour) Spreng. The diuretic effect of 
 <italic>C. nobile</italic> was assessed by examining the ratsâ€™ urine after fasted overnight (
