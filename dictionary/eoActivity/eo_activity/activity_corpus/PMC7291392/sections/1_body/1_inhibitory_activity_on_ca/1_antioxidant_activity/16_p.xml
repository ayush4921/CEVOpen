 <italic>Silybum marianum</italic> (L.) Gaertn. contains silymarin 
 <bold>(12)</bold>, which is one of the polyphenolic antioxidants. Administration of 200 mg/kg silymarin 
 <bold>(12)</bold> by intraperitoneal on rats reduced ROS level and protected the rats from supra celiac abdominal aorta ischemia or reperfusion injury. (

 <bold>(12)</bold> on the rats reduced iron and oxidative stress level of the rats’ blood. Besides, the phenolic structure of silymarin 
 <bold>(12)</bold> caused the compound to has a strong scavenger activity towards hypochlorous acid (HOCI). It inhibited hydroxyl radical formation, which is essential for the inhibition of xanthine oxidase activity (

 <bold>(12)</bold> caused inhibition of the NF-kB pathway by treating and attenuating the inﬂammatory reaction that stimulates atherosclerosis.
