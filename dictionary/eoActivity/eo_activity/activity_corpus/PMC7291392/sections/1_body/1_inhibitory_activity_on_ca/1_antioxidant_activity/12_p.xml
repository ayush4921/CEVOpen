<p>The essential oils and subfractions of 
 <italic>M. macrosiphon</italic> Coss. methanolic extract were examined their antioxidative properties 
 <italic>via in vitro</italic> study (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Amiri, 2011</xref>). In examining the effect of 
 <italic>M. macrosiphon</italic> on DPPH assay, the polar subfraction of the flowering stage was more potent with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 57.0 ± 0.6 mg/mL. In contrast, the essential oil of the flowering stage was more potent (EC
 <sub>50</sub>: 91.7 ± 1.2 mg/mL) in inhibiting α-carotene oxidation with almost similar inhibitory activity compared to the positive control, BHT. The oxidation of α-carotene was determined by observing its discoloration caused by coupled oxidation of linoleic acid and α-carotene that generates free radicals.
