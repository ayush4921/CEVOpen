<p>The dichloromethane extract of 
 <italic>Ziziphora clinopodioides</italic> Lam. (ZDCE) had shown a significant effect on the inhibition of extracellular Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> induced contraction in the pre-contracted rings by high KCl and phenylephrine. It also caused an inhibition of intracellular Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> release to the phenylephrine. Among the hexane, dichloromethane, and aqueous extracts, ZDCE had shown the endothelium-independent vasodilation properties that occurs due to the extracellular Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> influx 
 <italic>via</italic> the voltage and receptor-operated Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> channels, causing Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> inhibition from the stores of the intracellular and lastly 
 <italic>via</italic> opening the K
 <sup>+</sup> channels which are voltage-dependent (
