<p>The chemical substances that reduce or prevent oxidation are known as antioxidants. Antioxidants can resist the free radicals from causing damaging effects in tissues. They are often used to safeguard cerebrovascular diseases (

It occurs due to the free radicalâ€™s toxic being released by the vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells (
