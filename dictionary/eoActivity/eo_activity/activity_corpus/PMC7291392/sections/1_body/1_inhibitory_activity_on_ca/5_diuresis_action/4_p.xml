 <italic>Tanacetum vulgare</italic> L. leaf extract was studied on its ability to act as a diuretic on rats (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Lahlou et al., 2007</xref>). Water extract of the plant at a dose of 100 mg/kg was administered orally to the male Wistar rats. An increase in urine output was identified after 24 h of administration of the extract with a similar amount compared to furosemide administration. The extract had caused an increased level of Na
 <sup>+</sup> and K
 <sup>+</sup> in the urine, compared to furosemide, which has only an increase in Na
 <sup>+</sup>. In contrast, the extract does not affect Na
 <sup>+</sup> and K
 <sup>+</sup> levels of the plasma. The diuretic effect occurs due to the renal tubular suppression upon its tendency for reabsorption of electrolytes and water into the bloodstream. The plant extract does not cause any renal toxicity as repeated dosing upon the rat for nine consecutive days. Thus, it requires a clinical study to ensure that its safety profile matches up with the physiology of humans and the long duration that patients usually take on diuretics. Different studies have shown that 
 <italic>T. vulgare</italic> consists of flavonoids, tri- and sesquiterpene lactones and isoprenoids, polysaccharides, saponins, and polyphenols. Thus, it is unsure of which compound contributes to the diuretic effect of this extract (
