 <italic>Eclipta prostrata</italic> (L.) L. leaf extract was measured its hypolipidemic activity (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Dhandapani, 2007</xref>). The phytochemical screening had shown the presence of saponins, alkaloids, flavonoids, phytosterols, and tannins in the leaf extract. Atherogenic diet caused an increase in total cholesterol and total protein and decreased serum HDL-cholesterol level in rats. Daily administration of the aqueous extract in the dose 100 and 200 mg/kg increased the ratsâ€™ HDL level and reduced protein level, triglycerides, and total cholesterol significantly. It had also shown an increase in the atherogenic index. The saponins may contribute to the hypolipidemic effect of the plant extract (
