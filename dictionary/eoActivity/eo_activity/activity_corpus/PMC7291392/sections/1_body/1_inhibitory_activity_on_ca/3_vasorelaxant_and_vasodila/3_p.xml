<p>The aqueous extract of 
 <italic>Artemisia campestris</italic> L. aerial parts (AcAE) has a hypotensive and antihypertensive effect due to its vasodilatory effect (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Dib et al., 2017</xref>). The extract contains a high amount of polyphenols such as mono-and di-cinnamoyl compounds with the highest concentration of 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic (isochlorogenic A) as its constituent. Meanwhile, the major flavonoids in the extract were (5-caffeoylquinic) chlorogenic acid 
 <bold>(11)</bold> and vicenin-2 (apigenin 6,8-di-C-glucoside) 
 <bold>(16)</bold>. Daily administration of 150 mg/kg of AcAE on 
 <italic>L</italic>-NAME hypertensive rats prevented hypertension by reducing SBP from 170 to 114 mm Hg. The extract at the dose of 40 mg/kg reduced SBP and DBP without affecting heart rate. The extract caused vasorelaxation 
 <italic>via</italic> inhibition of calcium influx through voltage-operated calcium channels and the calmodulin-NO-sGC-PKG pathway. Besides, the extract also activated intracellular calcium mobilization into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (
