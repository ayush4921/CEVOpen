<p>The antioxidant activity of methanolic extract of aerial part of 
 <italic>C. crepidioides</italic> (Benth.) S. Moore was determined by measuring its total phenol and flavonoid content, reducing capacity and radical scavenging activity on DPPH assay (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Bahar et al., 2016</xref>). The plant consisted of various phytochemicals such as flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins, saponins, glycosides, and reducing sugar which, contributed to the extract’s antioxidant activity. The activity reported was lower (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 130.32 µg/mL) compared to ascorbic acid (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 11.24 µg/mL). The aerial part extract of the plant consists of gallic acid 
 <bold>(1)</bold> and quercetin 
 <bold>(3)</bold>, which tends to cause the antioxidant effect (
