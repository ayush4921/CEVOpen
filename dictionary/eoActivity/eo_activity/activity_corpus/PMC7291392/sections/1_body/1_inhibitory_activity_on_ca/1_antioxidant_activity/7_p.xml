 <italic>Ballota glandulosissima</italic> Hub. -Mor. and Patzak is a Turkish Ballota species, collected from Kumluca. The aerial parts of 
 <italic>B. glandulosissima</italic> were extracted using ethanolic extract and were determined its antioxidant activity 
 <italic>via in vitro</italic> (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Citoglu et al., 2004</xref>). The extract showed remarkable anti-superoxide anion formation by inhibiting the activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.51 mg/mL. In inhibiting lipid peroxidation, the extract exhibited a strong inhibitory capacity and potent scavenging property (IC
 <sub>50</sub>, 15 mg/mL) compared to Î±-tocopherol (IC
 <sub>50</sub>, 3 mg/mL) (
