 <italic>Satureja cuneifolia</italic> Ten. is a plant species from the Satureja genus. Its constituent, eriodictyol 
 <bold>(21)</bold>, possessed a vasodilatory effect in the rat aorta (

 <sup>5</sup> M and 5 Ã— 10
 <sup>5</sup> M showed the inhibitory effect of calcium chloride, CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> in the concentration-response curve. It possessed a weak inhibition in the calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum whereby showing off a light relaxant effect. The final results of the study indicated that the partial mechanism of the vasodilatory effect was due to its inhibition of enzyme protein such as myosin light chain kinase that related to protein kinase C or inhibition of calcium influx (
