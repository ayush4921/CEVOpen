<p>Alcohol extract (IrA) and hexane extract (IrH) of

 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Mangathayaru et al., 2009</xref>). IrA showed antihyperlipidemic activity by reducing lipid peroxidation and lipid uptake. It decreased foam cell formation and led to a reduction of fatty streak formation. Meanwhile, IrH exhibited more significant activity in enhancing HDL-C (p &lt; 0.001) than in reducing LDL levels. Based on the effects of the extracts on coronary artery histopathology, IrA and IrH had shown a replacement in a muscular pattern which is the type of primary medial destruction in early atherosclerosis. It also caused the cardiac tissue to be devoid of fatty degeneration. The presence of the phenolic compounds contributes to the inhibition of LDL oxidation and prevent the degradation and uptake of oxidized LDL by macrophages (
