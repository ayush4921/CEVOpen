<p>The anticoagulant activity of 
 <italic>Tridax procumbens</italic> (L.) L. was examined (
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">Naqash and Nazeer, 2011</xref>). Sulfated polysaccharide isolated from the leaf extract of 
 <italic>T. procumbens</italic> acts as an anticoagulant on heparin and chondroitin sulfate. Based on the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> assay, the activated aPTT had been prolonged to 113 s at 100 Î¼g/mL by the sulfated polysaccharides from 
 <italic>T. procumbens</italic>, which is almost 4-fold higher than the standard group. The sulfate group causes the anticoagulant activity but it is dependent on the sulfate group position in the chemical structure (
