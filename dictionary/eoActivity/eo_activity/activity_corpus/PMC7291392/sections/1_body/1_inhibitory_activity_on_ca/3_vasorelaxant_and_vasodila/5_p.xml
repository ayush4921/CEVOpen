 <italic>Clinopodium vulgare</italic> L. was used in 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies to understand its antihypertensive activity (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Khan et al., 2018</xref>). The administration of 
 <italic>C. vulgaris</italic> crude extract and fractions on normotensive and high salt-induced hypertensive rats reduced the ratsâ€™ mean arterial pressure (MAP). It has a distinct effect on hypertensive rats compared to the normotensive rats. At the dose of 1, 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg, the extract had shown an antihypertensive effect in hypertensive rats with the most significant activity exhibited by the extract at the dose of 10 and 30 mg/kg. The vasodilatory effect of the extract (EC
 <sub>50</sub>:0.27 mg/mL) in the extracted rat aorta was endothelium-dependently. The extracts worked by inhibiting the high K
 <sup>+</sup> precontraction and rightward shifted Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> concentration-response curves which have an identical mechanism to verapamil. The antihypertensive effect that was showed by 
 <italic>C. vulgaris</italic> is due to the vasodilation effect that involves muscarinic receptor-linked NO and activation of tetraethylammonium (TEA)-sensitive K
 <sup>+</sup> channels, Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> antagonism, and prostacyclin. The methanolic extract of the plant consists of quercetin 
 <bold>(3)</bold> and rutin, which may act as the substance that possesses the vasodilatory effect (
