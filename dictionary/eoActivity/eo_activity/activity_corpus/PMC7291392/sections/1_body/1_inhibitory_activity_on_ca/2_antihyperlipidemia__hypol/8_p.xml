 <italic>Cynara cardunculus</italic> L. is known for its antiatherogenic and hypolipidemic effects. Hypercholesterolemic rats were fed with 
 <italic>C. cardunculus</italic> leaves aqueous extract at the amount of 150, 300, and 60 mg/kg (
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">Mocelin et al., 2016</xref>). The extracts exhibited DPPH scavenging activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 57.40 ± 2.05 µg/mL. After four weeks of treatment, the serum lipid profile showed that there was a decrease in total cholesterol and LDL-C levels. The flavonoids and phenols content decreased the activities of acyl-CoA acetyltransferase and HMG-CoA reductase in the hypercholesterolemic rats. It decreased the availability of cholesterol esters to form VLDL, which caused a reduction in the secretion of VLDL from the liver (
