<p>The phenolic compounds isolated from the ethanolic extract of the whole plant of 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> L. were determined their antioxidant activity. From the study, 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> consists of phenol compounds such as 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, 3,4-dihydrobenzoic acid, rosmarinic acid 
 <bold>(5)</bold>, origanoside, maltol, 
 <italic>E</italic>-caffeic acid 
 <bold>(6)</bold>, apigenin 
 <bold>(7)</bold>, luteolin 
 <bold>(8)</bold>, and didymin (

 <italic>in vitro</italic> test, the phenolic compounds of 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> showed potent antioxidant activity. The SC
 <sub>50</sub> values of the compounds ranged from 16.7 ± 1.1 to 221.8 ± 49.0 µM. The scavenging activity of the compound that consists of 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl and gastrodin moiety was higher than its positive control, the ascorbic acid. The highest radical scavenging activities were exhibited by compounds with danshensu moieties with SC
 <sub>50</sub> values 17.5 ± 1.1 µM and 16.7 ± 1.1 µM. The phenolic structure is responsible for the scavenging activity by donating the hydroxyl group to the free radicals (

The FRAP values of the compounds ranged from 143.0 ± 4.0 and 201.0 ± 8.0, with the highest activity exhibited by origanoside and apigenin
