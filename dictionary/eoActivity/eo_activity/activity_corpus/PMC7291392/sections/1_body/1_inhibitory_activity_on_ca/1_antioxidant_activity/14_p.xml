 <italic>Salvia ofﬁcinalis</italic> L., which is also known as sage, contains phenolic compounds in its shoot part (
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">Santos-Gomes et al., 2002</xref>). The antioxidant extract of the shoots contains phenolic acids such as gallic acid 
 <bold>(1)</bold>, rosmarinic acid 
 <bold>(5)</bold>, caffeic acid 
 <bold>(6)</bold>, 5-
 <italic>O</italic>-caffeoylquinic acid, and 3-
 <italic>O</italic>- caffeoylquinic acid. The identified flavonoids in the extract are hesperetin, genkwanin, hispidulin, cirsimaritin, and apigenin 
 <bold>(7)</bold>. Whereas, the phenolic diterpenes are methyl carnosate, rosmanol 
 <bold>(9)</bold>, epirosmanol, epiisorosmanol ethyl ether, epirosmanol methyl ether, carnosic acid, rosmadial, and carnosol
 <bold>(10)</bold>. The rosmarinic acid 
 <bold>(5)</bold>, carnosic acid, and carnosol 
 <bold>(10)</bold> contributed to 
 <italic>S. ofﬁcinalis</italic> inhibitory activity on lipid peroxidation (
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">Santos-Gomes et al., 2002</xref>). The ethanolic leaves extract of the plant contains a high amount of chlorogenic acid 
 <bold>(11)</bold> and rosmarinic acid 
 <bold>(5)</bold>. The compounds exhibited strong antioxidant activity due to the ability of their phenols structure to donate hydrogen atoms to free radicals. (
