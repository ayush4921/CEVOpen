 <italic>Achillea arabica</italic> Kotschy ethanolic extract was used to test its hypolipidemic effect in animals (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Mais et al., 2016</xref>). The extract was from the aerial parts of the plant taken during its flowering phase. The high-fat diet was fed to adult male Golden-Syrian hamsters for ten days to cause hyperlipidemia. The dose of 400 mg/kg of the 
 <italic>A. arabica</italic> ethanolic extract had reduced VLDL, cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides level in the hamstersâ€™ serum. It had no significant effect on HDL. Total cholesterol and triglycerides in the hepatic were also reduced. The plant extract contains flavonoids, sesquiterpene lactones, and polyphenols. Whereas, its essential oil contains a high amount of eucalyptol

 <bold>(14)</bold> (12.46%) and piperitone 
 <bold>(15)</bold> (31.06%). These may act as an inducer for the hypolipidemic effect of 
 <italic>A. arabica</italic> upon the experimental hyperlipidemic hamster (
