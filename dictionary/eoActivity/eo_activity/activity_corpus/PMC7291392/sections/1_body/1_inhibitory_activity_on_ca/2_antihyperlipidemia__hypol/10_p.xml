 <italic>Emilia praetermissa</italic> Milne-Redh had shown its antihyperlipidemic effect 
 <italic>via</italic> its aqueous leaf extract. The extract at doses of 100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg, and 400 mg/kg were fed to male albino rats. As a result, the extract reduced the levels of plasma atherogenic index, total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides, and raised the level of HDL significantly when compared with the hyperlipidemic group. The hypolipidemic activity might due to the cholesterol-lowering effect of the extract, which may be portrayed by tannins, terpenoids, and flavonoids content. Terpenoid acts as an intermediate in cholesterol synthesis. It regulates the degradation of HMG-CoA reductase activity, which is the main enzyme in cholesterol synthesis (
