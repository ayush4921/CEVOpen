 <italic>Erigeron canadensis</italic> L. consists of different types of flavonoids and tannins on top of the essential oil that is present. Its polyphenolic-polysaccharide preparation was isolated from its flowering part and was determined its anticoagulant activity 
 <italic>via in vivo</italic> assay (
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">Pawlaczyk et al., 2011</xref>). The plant preparation had shown its anti-platelet activity specifically towards the cyclooxygenase pathway that was induced by the arachidonic acid (AA), which is similar to acetylsalicylic acid activity. The assay was conducted on standardized human plasma by measuring prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). The plant preparation inhibited plasma clot formation in aPTT and PT at the concentration of 390 µg/mL and 1.56 mg/mL, respectively. The plant preparation also exhibited significant anti-IIa activity mediated by the cofactor II of heparin. Further fractionation of the plant preparation at the concentration of 50 µg/mL, showed higher anticoagulation activity in aPTT test corresponded to 7 to 9 IU/mg of 5
 <sup>th</sup> International Standard for Unfractionated Heparin (ISUH). 
 <italic>In vivo</italic> studies also showed that the dose of 50 mg/mL of the plant preparation has the anticoagulant effect in the rat. These anticoagulant activities are essential in patients suffering from deep vein thrombosis, and those had already been resistant to the acetylsalicylic derivatives drugs (
