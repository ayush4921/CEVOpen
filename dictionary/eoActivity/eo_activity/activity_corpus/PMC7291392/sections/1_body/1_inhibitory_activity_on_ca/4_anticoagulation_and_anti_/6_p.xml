 <italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic> Bunge consists of phenolic acid that is water-soluble, which is the salvianolic acid 
 <bold>(23)</bold> (SAA). The study examined the effect of SAA in the antiplatelet and antithrombotic effect (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Fan et al., 2010</xref>). In the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assay, Tyrode’s solution was used to study the antiplatelet properties using a platelet aggregometer. The maximum height reached 
 <italic>via</italic> the aggregation curves determines the extent of platelet aggregation of SAA. All tests showed that SAA had an inhibitory effect on ADP, thrombin, and platelet aggregation that was induced by AA. The compound inhibited ADP-induced platelet aggregation of rats with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 390 µg/mL, whereby it inhibited the thrombin-induced platelet aggregation with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 912 µg/mL. SAA (1,000 µg/mL) exhibited mild inhibitory activity on AA-induced platelet aggregation. In the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> study, the administration of SAA at dose 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg 
 <italic>via</italic> intravenous caused dose-dependent inhibition upon the platelet aggregation in the rats. A similar observation with the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> study was observed. This study claimed that the SAA antiplatelet activity was due to the interference to a common signaling pathway, then directly binding to thrombin, ADP or AA to their respective receptors. The inhibition of ADP from dense granules of activated platelet might be one of the factors of the anti-aggregating properties of SAA (
