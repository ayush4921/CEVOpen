<p id="p0040">A Hewlett-Packard (HP) 6890 Series II gas chromatograph (Hewlett-Packard Inc., Palo Alto, California, USA) equipped with a flame-ionization detector (FID) was employed for GC analysis. The GC was run at a flow rate of 1 mL/min and with a split ratio of 30:1 using helium as carrier gas. The column was 60 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm film thickness, coated with DB-WAX (J &amp; W Scientific Inc., Folsom, CA, USA) was used to separate the volatiles. The oven temperature was kept at 60 °C for 4 min initially and then increased at a rate of 2 °C/min to 200 °C. Injector and detector temperature were set at 200 °C and 220 °C, respectively. Each sample was analyzed in duplicate.</p>
