<p id="p0045">A HP 5890 Series II gas chromatograph (Hewlett-Packard) equipped with an HP 5972 mass selective detector and Wiley275 library was used for the GC-MS analysis. The same GC conditions were used as described for the GC analysis above. We recorded electron impact (EI) spectra by maintaining the temperature of the ion source at 220 Â°C, and mass spectra were obtained from 30 to 400 mass units at 70 eV in a
