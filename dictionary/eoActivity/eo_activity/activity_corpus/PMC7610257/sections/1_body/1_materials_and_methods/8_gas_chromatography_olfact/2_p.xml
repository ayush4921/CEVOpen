<p id="p0055">In split-less mode, with a column of 60 m × 0.53 mm i.d. (1 μm film) coated with DB-WAX (J &amp; W Scientific), the GC-O was performed. Same temperature conditions and instrument were employed as used for the GC analysis. Helium was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 8.3 mL/min 1 μL sample of concentrated volatile was injected into the column in split less mode and the carrier gas was passed through the FID detector and a glass sniffing port at 220 °C after splitting of 1:1 at the outlet of the column. Wet air was pumped into the sniffing port at 45 mL/min to retain the nose moist and remove the odorant quickly.</p>
