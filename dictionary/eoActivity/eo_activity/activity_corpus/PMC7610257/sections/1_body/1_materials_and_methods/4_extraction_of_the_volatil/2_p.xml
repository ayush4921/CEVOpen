<p id="p0035">Twenty-five grams powder of 
 <italic>Nigella sativa</italic> L. seeds was soaked overnight twice in methanol (50 mL). After filtration, the supernatant was diluted with Milli-Q system (Millipore Corp., Saint-Quentin, France) purified water and adjusted to 10% methanol. The diluted solution was applied to a chromatography column packed with Porapak Q resin (porous polymer resin) (Waters, 50/80 mesh). After eliminating the water-soluble compounds with ultrapure water (200 mL), the adsorbed compounds were eluted with 300 mL mixture of pentane and diethyl ether (1:1). After desorption, 3 μg of ethyl lactate was added as an internal standard (IS). To obtain the aroma concentrate (essential oil), the elute was dried in anhydrous sodium sulfate and the solvent was evaporated at 39.5 °C under atmospheric pressure. Each procedure was repeated twice. The oil percentage was then calculated and stored in an airtight amber container in a freezer at -20 °C for subsequent analyses. Just before injecting into the gas chromatograph, the extract was concentrated to 500 μL with a nitrogen stream and the components were analyzed by using gas chromatography (GC), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and GC-Olfactometry [
