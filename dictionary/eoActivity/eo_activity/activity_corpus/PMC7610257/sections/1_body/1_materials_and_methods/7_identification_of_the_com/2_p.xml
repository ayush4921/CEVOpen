<p id="p0050">Peak components were identified according to Kovats GC retention indices [
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] with authentic standard and comparing the mass spectra with those in the Wiley Library of MS spectra (Hewlett-Packard) patterns stored on the computer or with published literature. In case of unavailability of reference standard, the compounds were tentatively identified based on MS data only. We calculated the percent peak areas by dividing the peak area for a peak by the total peak area for the entire chromatogram on GC chromatogram with FID and expressed as a percentage [
