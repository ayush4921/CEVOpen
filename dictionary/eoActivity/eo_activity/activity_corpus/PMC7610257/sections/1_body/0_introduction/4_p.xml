<p id="p0020">Effectiveness of black cumin seed and its volatile component thymoquinone in anticonvulsive, pain protection, and prevention of rheumatoid arthritis in rat models have also been reported [
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Overall, several bodies of work suggest these seeds hold diverse therapeutic potentials. The contribution of minor compounds present in the seeds warrants investigation, as they might be responsible for the previously mentioned effects. Therefore, the compositional variations in 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seeds and presence of beneficial compounds requires exploration for distinctive medicinal application. Like most herbs, compositional variation depends on the region of collection, time of harvest and agronomic practices that have been reported for 
 <italic>Nigella sativa</italic> seeds [
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Bourgou et al. [
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] reported a distinctive type of 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene from Tunisian essential oil of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seeds, which is different from what is found in the seeds of other origins. Studies also reported harmful water stress effects on the yield of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> and quantitative yield of different components [
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Despite numerous studies on 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic>, the volatile composition of black cumin cultivated in different regions of the world, especially in Bangladesh and India have not been explored. This study was undertaken to determine the compositional variation of volatile components of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seeds cultivated in Bangladesh and India.
