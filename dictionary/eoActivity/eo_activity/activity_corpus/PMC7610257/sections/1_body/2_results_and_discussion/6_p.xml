<p id="p0085">In the present study, 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene has been determined as the major components in both Bangladeshi and Indian seeds of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic>, which is consistent with findings from previous studies. However, there is a compositional variation of 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene that exists between different studies depending on the location of cultivation of seed [

 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Interestingly, some study reported thymoquinone as the key components of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> essential oil [
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In the present study, Bangladeshi 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seeds contained almost 3-fold thymoquinone (29.77%) compared to Indian seeds (10.27%). Liu et al. [
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] also reported a higher level of thymoquinone in seeds of Bangladesh compared to that of the Egyptian seed. This effect may be due to environmental conditions on the flowering as reported by D'Antuono et al. [
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. They reported that delay in sowing of seeds reduced the content of thymoquinone, while increasing the 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene and thymol content of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> oil. Additionally, substantial compositional differences in 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seeds have been reported for different plant origin [

 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Thymoquinone has been reported as a promising therapeutic agent [
