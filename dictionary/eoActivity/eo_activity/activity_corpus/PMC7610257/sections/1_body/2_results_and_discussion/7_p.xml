<p id="p0090">As shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, monoterpenes were the main components in both Bangladeshi (88.36%) and Indian (79.96%) seeds, which is similar to the findings of others [
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The representative monoterpenes of the total volatiles are monoterpene hydrocarbons, 54.53% vs 63.18% with main component 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (36.35% vs 41.80%) followed by α-thujene (12.40% vs 13.93%); monoterpene ketones, 29.86% and 10.61% with main component thymoquinone (29.77% vs 10.27%); monoterpene phenols, carvacrol and thymol with a percentage of 2.92% and 3.74%; and monoterpene alcohols, 4-terpineol and 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymen-8-ol making only 0.9% and 2.2% respectively for Bangladesh and Indian seeds (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The sesquiterpene hydrocarbons represented only 0.97% and 0.73% of the essential oil respectively. Wais et al. [
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] also reported that sesquiterpenes and their oxygenated derivatives constituted only a small fraction of the essential oil (0.7% and 0.3%, respectively) for seeds of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> cultivated in Poland.
