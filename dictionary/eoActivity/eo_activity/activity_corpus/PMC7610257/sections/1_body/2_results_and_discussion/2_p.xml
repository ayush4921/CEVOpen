<p id="p0065">To understand the implication of flavor of volatile components of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seeds essential oil and its application in food industry, it is vital to characterize the volatile components. Characterization of volatile components is also necessary to further probe its role in traditional medicine. In this study, we obtained 0.28 g (1.1%) and 0.06 g (0.24%) volatile flavor concentrates from 25 g 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seeds from Bangladesh and Indian, respectively. We detected 38 and 41 volatile components and among these we identified 32 and 35 components from Bangladesh and Indian seeds respectively, which was 92.82% and 89.51% of the total constituents of volatile components. The typical gas chromatograms from the DB-Wax column of Bangladesh and Indian samples are shown in
