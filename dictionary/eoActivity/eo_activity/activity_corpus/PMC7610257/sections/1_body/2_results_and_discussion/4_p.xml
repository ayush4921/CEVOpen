<p id="p0075">It was not possible to identify six compounds from seeds of each origin by comparing with the existing spectra data in literature, fragmentation patterns of mass spectral, or the retention times and indices of the compounds. We could not identify a few compounds due to lack of reference standards. Identification of compounds was performed and reported only after comparing it with reference compounds and mass spectral data (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">TableÂ 1</xref>). Five compounds detected in Indian seeds were not detected in Bangladeshi seeds and two compounds detected in Bangladeshi seeds were not detected in Indian seeds. This may be due to presence of components below the amount required for mass spectra detection. An unidentified compound with a unique odor was found both in Bangladesh and Indian seeds, contributing 4.92% and 7.46% of the volatile constituents respectively.
