 <p>Past decades demonstrate an increasing interest in herbal remedies in the public eye, with as many as 80% of people worldwide using these remedies as healthcare products, including those for skin health. Sea buckthorn and its derived products (oil; alcoholic extracts), rich in flavonoids and essential fatty acids, are among these healthcare products. Specifically, sea buckthorn and its derivatives are reported to have antioxidant and antitumor activity in dysplastic skin cells. On the other hand, evidence suggests that the alteration of lipid metabolism is related to increased malignant behavior. Given the paradoxical involvement of lipids in health and disease, we investigated how sea-buckthorn seed oil, rich in long-chain fatty acids, modifies the proliferation of normal and dysplastic skin cells in basal conditions, as well as under ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation. Using real-time analysis of normal and dysplastic human keratinocytes, we showed that sea-buckthorn seed oil stimulated the proliferation of dysplastic cells, while it also impaired the ability of both normal and dysplastic cells to migrate over a denuded area. Furthermore, UVA exposure increased the expression of CD36/SR-B2, a long-chain fatty acid translocator that is related to the metastatic behavior of tumor cells.</p>
