  <p>Assessment of toxicity of sea-buckthorn seed oil. Normal human keratinocytes (HEK) and dysplastic keratinocytes were seeded at a density of 10,000 cells/well in 96 well plates and treated for three days with the indicated dilutions of sea-buckthorn seed oil. Cytotoxicity was assessed by lactate dehydrogenate (LDH) release in the cell medium and viability by MTS assay. LDH control is represented by the lysis control (100% mortality). The MTS control was represented by cells maintained in standard cell culture conditions. The highest non-toxic and pro-proliferative concentrations (highlighted in red) were chosen for further tests. Bars represent average of triplicates, calculated as percentage to control.</p>
