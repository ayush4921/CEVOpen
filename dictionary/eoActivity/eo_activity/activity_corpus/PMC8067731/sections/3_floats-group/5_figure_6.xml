  <p>CD36 expression in normal (HEKa) and dysplastic (DOK) keratinocytes after UVA irradiation. Expression of CD36 in both HEKa and DOK cells was assessed by confocal immunofluorescence and confirmed by Western blot. In basal conditions, CD36 expression in normal keratinocytes is undetectable with the selected methods. Its expression increases in dysplastic cells, as well as following UVA irradiation.</p>
