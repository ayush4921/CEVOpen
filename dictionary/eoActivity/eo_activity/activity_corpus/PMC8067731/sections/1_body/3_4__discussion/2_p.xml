<p>One putative mechanism for increased dysplastic cell proliferation following seed -il treatment could be CD36-mediated lipid uptake. Fatty acid transporters, including CD36, are overexpressed in tissues with an increased fatty acid metabolism [

A study by Pascual et al. revealed that CD36+ cells react to dietary lipids and rely on lipid metabolism for metastatic potential. In their study, CD44 bright cells isolated from human oral carcinomas exerted a distinctive ability to overexpress both the fatty acid receptor CD36 and lipid metabolism genes, thus accelerating the initiation of metastasis [
