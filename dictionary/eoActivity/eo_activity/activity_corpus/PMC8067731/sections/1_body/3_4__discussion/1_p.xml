<p>Our manuscript compares the effect of sea-buckthorn seed oil on normal and dysplastic human keratinocytes, starting from the premise that normal skin contains a mixture of both cells, whose proportion changes with age. It was demonstrated that sea-buckthorn fatty acids have the ability to improve the post-inflammatory response resulting from deleterious UV exposure. Moreover, they could alleviate the effects of sun burns, support regenerative processes of the skin and appease irritation [

It was previously demonstrated that dysplastic cells are less able to spread across a denuded area than normal keratinocytes, and were more affected than the latter by UVA treatment [

 <xref rid="B22-jpm-11-00278" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], may lead to an increased doubling time of a cell population, a finding which also was observed in our real-time, impedance-reading experiments. Dysplastic cells do not exhibit this protective effect; they are more prone to proliferate under UV irradiation, and the seed-oil treatment further aggravates this noxious behavior.
