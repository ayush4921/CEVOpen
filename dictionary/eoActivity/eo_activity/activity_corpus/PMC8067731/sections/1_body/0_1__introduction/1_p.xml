<p>Past decades show an increasing interest in herbal remedies in the public eye, and almost 80% of the population worldwide is now using them as healthcare products [

 <xref rid="B2-jpm-11-00278" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], particularly in developing countries. Sea buckthorn (
 <italic>Elaeagnus rhamnoides</italic> L.) is a unique medicinal and aromatic plant, frequently used as part of various pharmaceutical treatments, some of which are related to skin care. Sea-buckthorn-derived alcoholic extracts and seed oil were tested for antioxidant, antitumor and regenerative properties [
 <xref rid="B3-jpm-11-00278" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-jpm-11-00278" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Most of these properties are related to its complex structure, rich in flavonoids and essential fatty acids (FA) [
 <xref rid="B5-jpm-11-00278" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Antioxidant activity was suggested as a protectant against different types of irradiation (gamma irradiation [
 <xref rid="B6-jpm-11-00278" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], UVA and UVB [
 <xref rid="B3-jpm-11-00278" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]), and, indeed, sea-buckthorn oil treatment showed increased antioxidant protection in irradiated keratinocytes [
 <xref rid="B3-jpm-11-00278" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Anti-tumor activity of sea-buckthorn-derived products was mostly related to their phenolic compounds [
 <xref rid="B7-jpm-11-00278" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], mostly by inhibition of fatty acid synthase [
 <xref rid="B8-jpm-11-00278" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-jpm-11-00278" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, sea-buckthorn seeds and berries are rich in FA [
 <xref rid="B10-jpm-11-00278" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], which constitute an important percentage of the sea-buckthorn seed oil [
 <xref rid="B5-jpm-11-00278" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It is expected that various FA would contribute to the cellular effects reported in sea-buckthorn-oil-related studies, including effects on skin cells and in animal models.
