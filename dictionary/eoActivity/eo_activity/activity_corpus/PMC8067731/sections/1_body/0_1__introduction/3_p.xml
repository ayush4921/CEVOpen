<p>Given the paradoxical involvement of FA in health and disease, we investigated whether sea-buckthorn seed oil has regenerative properties for skin cells, in basal conditions as well as under UVA radiation, and if this effect is the same, regardless of the dysplastic nature of the cells. The expression of CD36/SR-B2, a fatty acid translocator, which favors the uptake of fatty acids from the extracellular environment, was also assessed in relationship to UVA exposure.</p>
