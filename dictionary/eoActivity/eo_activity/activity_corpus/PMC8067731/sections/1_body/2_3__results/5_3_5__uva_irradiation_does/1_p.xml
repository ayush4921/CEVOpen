<p>Next, we tested whether irradiation affects oil uptake into cells. Keratinocytes use lipids to seal the epidermis from the outer environment by deposition of sphingolipids in the extracellular space [

Both normal and dysplastic cells uptake presented increased lipid load following oil treatment. However, unlike normal cells, where only some cells are loaded with lipid inclusions, all dysplastic cells have a degree of lipid load. Irradiation did not significantly affect the upload of lipids in both normal and dysplastic cells, but dysplastic cells showed a more uniform lipid uptake (
