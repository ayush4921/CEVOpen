<p>Next, in real-time microscopy we assessed the ability of cells to proliferate and migrate in a scratch-wound assay, following 24 h treatment with sea-buckthorn oil at 1/8000 dilution. After 24 h, both treated and untreated dysplastic cells failed to migrate and close the denuded area, and the oil treatment impaired migration even further (
