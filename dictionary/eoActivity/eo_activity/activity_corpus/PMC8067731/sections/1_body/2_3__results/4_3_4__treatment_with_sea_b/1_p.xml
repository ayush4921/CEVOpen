<p>As sea-buckthorn oil is reported to have protective effects against irradiation, we tested the effect of UVA irradiation on normal and dysplastic keratinocytes adherence using a real-time impedance reading system. This investigation allowed for the quantification of cell adherence (e.g., required for re-adhesion of daughter-cells after cell division) and of cell proliferation by calculation of doubling times using the xCELLigence platform (

Doubling times analysis confirmed MTS data regarding stimulation of cell viability with the selected dilution of sea-buckthorn seed oil. Notably, oil treatment on irradiated cells significantly decreased doubling times, which translates into increased proliferation rate of cells.
