<p>Long-chain FA used by cells to synthesize phospholipids and sphingolipids do not easily diffuse through cell membranes and are more efficiently up-taken with the help of fatty acid translocators, such as CD36/SR-B2. Furthermore, CD36/SR-B2 was shown to be involved in the tumorigenesis of aggressive, metastatic cancers (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B19-jpm-11-00278" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]). Using two different methods, we investigated the expression of CD36 in normal and dysplastic keratinocytes following UVA irradiation. The expression of CD36 in normal keratinocytes is undetectable in both IF (data not shown) and WB, and it appears to be slightly induced by irradiation. In contrast, dysplastic keratinocytes express a stronger signal for CD36, in both control and irradiated cells (
