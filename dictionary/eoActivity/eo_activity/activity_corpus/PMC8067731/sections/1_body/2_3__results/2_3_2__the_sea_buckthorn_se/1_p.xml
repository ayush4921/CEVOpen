<p>We tested the effect of sea-buckthorn seed oil on viability of normal and dysplastic skin cells using serial dilutions starting at 1/2000 (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic> in complete cell medium). The starting concentration was chosen following previous experiments, in which higher concentrations were cytotoxic for both cell types (data not shown). Further dilutions showed no cytotoxicity when reported on non-treated controls. Cell viability increased with subsequent dilution up to 1/8000, and then it started to decrease for both cell types (
