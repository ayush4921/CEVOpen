<p>Plant-derived bioactive compounds or mixtures have gradually become a hot topic in recent years, as a growing body of data points to their beneficial effects. However, these effects can vary from cell type to cell type. Here, we showed that, although sea-buckthorn seed oil has been associated with skin health and protection against irradiation, it also stimulates proliferation of dysplastic cells, while impairing the ability of both normal and dysplastic cells for wound-healing. We also investigated the expression of CD36, a fatty acid translocator, on normal and dysplastic keratinocytes, and we found that UVA exposure increases its expression, which could hold functional significance for further progression towards malignancy.</p>
