<p>Western blotting (WB): Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer with 1% protease inhibitor cocktail (P8340 Sigma), centrifuged for 10 min at 11,000 rpm (Ohaus R5510), and the supernatant boiled for 10 min (1:1

Then, 40 Âµg of protein were loaded on each well, migrated in 10% SDS-PAGE gel for 2 h at 20 mA/gel and transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (BioRad) (1 h, 100 V). The membrane was incubated overnight in primary antibodies (anti-CD36 AF2519, R&amp;D Systems, anti-GAPDH PA1-987, ThermoFisher), washed three times in TBS-T 0.5% and one time in TBS the next day and incubated for 1 h at room temperature (RT) in secondary antibodies (chicken-anti goat sc2953, SantaCruz, goat-anti rabbit 92680011, LiCor). Image acquisition was performed using a c-Digit scanner (LI-COR).
