<p>Immunofluorescence (IF): Cells were grown on coverslips fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 5 min, rinsed in phosphate buffer saline (PBS), permeabilized in 0.1%Triton-X 100 and in 0.5% BSA for 10 min and incubated for 2 h with the primary antibody (anti-CD36 ThermoFisher PA1-16813, 1:100) at room temperature. After 3 Ã— 5 min washes in PBS, cells were incubated with the secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit Oregon Green 488, Invitrogen 011038, 1:2000 in PBS), and the nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Image acquisition was performed with a Leica TCS SP8 white light laser confocal microscope.</p>
