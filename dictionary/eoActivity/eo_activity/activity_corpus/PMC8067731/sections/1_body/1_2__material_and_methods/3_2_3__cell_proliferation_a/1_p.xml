<p>Cytotoxicity was assessed by cellular lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)release (CytoTox 96 Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay, Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Specifically, 10,000 cells were seeded in triplicate overnight in 96-well plates and incubated the next day with serial dilutions of stock solution for an additional 72 h. Two controls were included—a negative control (cell culture medium only) and a positive control (addition of Cell Lysis Reagent 10x, Promega, 45 min prior to LDH detection). For background subtraction, additional triplicates of cell-free wells were incubated with tested solutions. For LDH analysis, 50 µL of supernatant were collected from each well and incubated with assay reagent for 30 min in the dark. After the addition of stop solution, absorbance was read at 490 nm by using a microplate reader Anthos Zenyth 3100 (Wals, Austria). Cytotoxicity was assessed as a percentage of the positive control, according to the formula cytotoxicity = 100*(Sample OD − background OD)/(average positive control − average background).</p>
