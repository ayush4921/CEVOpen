<p>Targeted quantification of fatty acids was carried out by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Analyses were performed on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer model API3200 (Sciex) coupled with an Infinity 1260 binary pump (Agilent) and autosampler. Analyst software version 1.5.2 was used for data acquisition and processing. After testing several stationary phases, chromatographic separation was achieved on a Phenomenex Luna pentafluorophenyl (PFP2) column (100 mm × 2 mm, 3 μm, 100 Å) using a mobile phase composed of water and acetonitrile at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. Seed oil was dissolved in ethanol at 1 mg/mL, and 3 µL of the solution were injected in the LC-MS/MS system. The mass spectrometer was operated in negative electrospray ionization (ESI). Acquisitions were carried out in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode using the specific traces of each fatty acid (see

A general screening of the seed oil volatile constituents was performed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC/MS). A Perkin Elmer CLARUS 680 gas chromatograph (equipped with an ELITE 5 MS column (1,4-bis (dimethylsiloxy)) phenylene dimethyl polysiloxane stationary phase, 30 m, 0.25 mm ID, 0.25 µm film thickness, eluted with helium at 1 mL/min), connected to a Clarus SQ8T quadrupole, was used for this purpose. For analysis, 1 µg of seed oil solutions prepared at 50 mg/mL in ethanol were injected in split mode (40:1). Compound identification was achieved by searching the obtained mass spectra in the NIST and Wiley libraries.
