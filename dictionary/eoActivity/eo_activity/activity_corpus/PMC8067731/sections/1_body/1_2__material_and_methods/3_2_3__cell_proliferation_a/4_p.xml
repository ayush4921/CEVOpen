<p>Real-time impedance readings: Cell adhesion and cell proliferation were assessed using RTCA DP platform (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Cells were pre-irradiated with UVA for 30 min as previously described [
 <xref rid="B17-jpm-11-00278" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and then they were trypsinized and seeded in E-16 plates at a density of 20,000 cells/well, with or without the cell medium, and supplemented or not with sea-buckthorn oil 1/8000. Readings were collected every 5 min for 24 h. Cell index at 2 h (at plateau) was used for statistical analysis (One-Way Anova, Dunnett multiple comparison, where data were compared to control. *
