<p>Proliferation was assessed by MTS assay (CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Reagent, Promega, Madison, WI USA). Specifically, 10,000 cells were seeded in triplicates overnight in 96-well plates and incubated the next day with cell culture medium and/or serial dilutions of stock solution for 72 h. A positive control (non-treated cells) was included. For background subtraction, additional triplicates of cell-free wells were incubated with tested solutions. On the day of the reading, the cell media was removed, and 100 µL of fresh medium and 20 µL of MTS reagent were added to each well. The plate was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h in a humidified, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere. Absorbance was read at 490 nm by using a microplate reader Anthos Zenyth 3100 (Wals, Austria). Proliferation was assessed as a percentage of the control: % of proliferation = 100*(sample OD − background OD)/(average control − average control background).
