<p>Oil Red staining: Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 30 min to 1 h, washed with water, and then incubated with 60% isopropanol for 5 min. Oil Red O Stock solution (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) was reconstituted with 100% isopropanol. Oil Red O Working solution was prepared 15 min before staining by mixing three parts of Oil Red O Stock solution and two parts of water, and then the solution was filtered through Whatman No.1 filter paper. The cells were stained with Oil Red O Working solution for 10 min at room temperature and afterward washed 2â€“5 times with water until no excess stain was seen. DAPI staining can be performed after this step for 10 min, at room temperature, and protected from light. The red lipid droplets were visualized by using fluorescent microscopy with a Nikon TI (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) inverted fluorescence microscope.</p>
