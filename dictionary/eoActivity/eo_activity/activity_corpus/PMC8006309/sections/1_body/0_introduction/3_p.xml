<p>The 
 <italic>Suaeda monoica</italic> Forssk. ex J.F.Gmel. (Family: Amaranthaceae Juss.) is endemic to India and falls under the genus 
 <italic>Suaeda Forssk</italic>. Ex J.F.Gmel which is native to Europe, Asia-Tropical, Africa, America, Australasia and other countries (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Hassler, 2019</xref>). The 
 <italic>Suaeda monoica</italic> species is found as mangrove associate herb in the coastal zones of India and is also known as 
 <italic>Suaeda monoica</italic> (syn. 
 <italic>Suaeda nudiflora</italic> (Willd.) Moq) in MPNS Portal. Except a very limited preliminary phytomedicinal studies, no in-depth work has been done on this wonderful ethnomedicinal herb species of Indian subcontinent (

 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">Vanga and Peddinti (2014)</xref> were the first to report antioxidant, antibacterial and anthelmintic activities of different solvent extracts of 
 <italic>Suaeda monoica</italic> while 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Eswaraiaha et al. (2019)</xref> showed that the leaf extract of 
 <italic>S. monoica</italic> possessed anticancer property and exhibited reduced proliferation of MCF 7 and HeLa cells. Anti-cancer activity in 
 <italic>Suaeda monoica</italic> Forssk. ex. J.F. Gmel. was also reported with the identification of a couple of active compounds (

 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">Siddiqui et al., 2020</xref>). In India, since local people use this halophytic succulent herb as fodder for wound healing, burn the leaves to repel mosquitoes, use as antidiuretic compound and drink the juice of the leaves in diarrhea as electrolytes, a proper validation of a variety of ethnomedicinal properties of this plant is fairly warranted. In addition, the monotypic distribution of the plant has not been addressed so far, which may be due to allelopathic/phytotoxic activity of the plant, and deserves to be investigated.
