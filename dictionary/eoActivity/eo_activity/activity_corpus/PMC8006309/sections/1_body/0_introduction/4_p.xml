<p>With the above background, the present study has undertaken comprehensive approaches to explore and compare a wide range of bioactivities including antimicrobial, antifungal, antioxidant, antidiuretic, allelopathic, antihaemolytic and mosquitocidal properties in various solvent extracts of the leaf and root-shoot (RS) of the plant 
 <italic>Suaeda</italic>. The solvent extracts exhibiting various bioactivities were investigated further to identify the presence of various principal phytochemicals using a combination of analyses including high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS).
