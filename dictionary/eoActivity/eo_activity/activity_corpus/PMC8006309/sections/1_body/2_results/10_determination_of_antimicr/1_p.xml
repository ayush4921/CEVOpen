<p>The different solvent extracts of leaf and RS fraction of 
 <italic>S. monoica</italic> showed positive antibacterial and antifungal activities based on plate based screening (
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s11">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). MIC values of the antibacterial and antifungal activities of the solvent extracts were determined against three human pathogens and three plant pathogens respectively by microdilution assay. Both the leaf and RS samples extracted with 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane exhibited highest antibacterial activity. According to the data of MIC values, obtained for various solvent extracts, it was observed that 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane showed MIC of 3.9 mg/ml against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 7.82 mg/ml against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Saponin exhibited modest antibacterial activity against the Gram-negative (
 <italic>E. coli, K. pneumonia</italic>) and Gram-positive (
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>) bacteria. However, all the extracts were unable to kill Carbapenem resistant 
 <italic>K. pneumonia</italic> but could kill Carbapenem sensitive 
 <italic>K. pneumonia</italic>. 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s11">Supplementary Figure S5</xref> shows the MIC results of antibacterial activity from 96-well plate assay. The MIC values of antifungal activity against all the three tested plant pathogenic fungi 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> (WHK-43), 
 <italic>Pleospora herbarum</italic> (WHK-137), and 
 <italic>Alternaria alternate</italic> (WHK 141) were also determined. However, the antifungal activity was not as strong as that of antibacterial activity. Nevertheless, the RS fraction showed higher antifungal activity than the leaf part. The MICs, 250 mg/ml, were determined for all the extracts of RS samples while 500 mg/ml for that of the leaf samples.
