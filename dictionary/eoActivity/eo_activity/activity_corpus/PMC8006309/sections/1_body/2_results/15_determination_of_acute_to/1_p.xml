<p>The Swiss albino mice used in the present study, showed no toxicity in the dose range of 150–3,000 mg/kg of various extracts as evidenced by the absence of tremor, weight loss, paralysis, lethargy or diarrhea. Again, none of the treated mice showed any stress symptom or got expiredwithin the observed period of 1 month, suggesting that the LD
 <sub>50</sub> value must be greater than 3,000 mg/kg.Diuresis experiment with selected solvent extracts (aqueous, methanol and 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane) showed a positive diuresis activity in a dose dependent manner (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Diuretic activity is considered to be good, if it is more than 1.50; moderate, if it is between 1.00 and 1.50; little, if it is between 0.72-1.00 and nil, if it less than 0.72 (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Hailu and Engidawork, 2014</xref>). The aqueous and methanolic extracts, administered at 1,000 mg/kg showed moderate diuretic activity while the remaining extracts displayed little or no activity under the tested dose concentrations. Concentration of electrolytes was calculated to know the type of diuresis. In the present study, along with an increase in urine volume, there was an increase in electrolyte concentration suggesting saluretic nature of remedial molecule(s) present in the plant extract but not of aquaretic type, in which case, water excretion supposed to enhance without accompanying increase in electrolytes. Also, the plant extracts showed natriuretic activity (higher Na
 <sup>+</sup> excretion than that of K
 <sup>+</sup>). This feature is considered as an important safety profile to consider it as a diuretic agent and can serve as one of the better alternatives to synthetic diuretics like furosemide, which exerts potential adverse effects such as hypokalemiais. Moreover, the extracts showed better activity than that of standard drug furosemide in P
 <sup>+</sup> excretion in urine. The Cl
 <sup>−</sup>/(Na
 <sup>+</sup> + K
 <sup>+</sup>) ratio which stands for carbonic anhydrase inhibitory (CAI) activity shows a value of less than 0.8. Carbonic anhydrase inhibition activity can be excluded at ratios between 1.0 and 0.8. Carbonic anhydrase activity begins at a ratio value of less than 0.8 and descending ratio values indicate the presence of slight to strong carbonic anhydrase inhibition activity. In this study, all the extracts exhibited a CAI value of &lt;0.8, indicating the presence of carbonic anhydrase inhibition activity. Therefore, carbonic anhydrase inhibition in diuretic action is likely to be involved in observed diuresis. The low carbonic anhydrase inhibitory activity indicated that the extracts elicited their diuretic action though a possible mechanism of increased loss of K
 <sup>+</sup> (
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">Vogel, 2002</xref>). This is also supported by the Na
 <sup>+</sup>/K
 <sup>+</sup> ratios (&lt;10) which also indicates that the extracts are not of potassium-sparing type of weak diuretic that increases urination without loss of K
 <sup>+</sup>. Results of the present study suggest that effects of some constituents in the extract on urinary electrolytes and water excretion are similar to that of furosemide. It may be mentioned here that diuretics are useful in the treatment of cardiovascular complaints like hypertension and congestive cardiac failure. In this contest, most of the patents on diuretic drugs, use a combination of diuretic sulfonamide carbonic anhydrase inhibitors with other agents for the management of cardiovascular diseases and obesity. It is believed that such combinations exert a better therapeutic activity compared to similar diuretics that do not inhibit CAs (

 <italic>S. monoica</italic> supposed to serve as a suitable candidate for the treatment of hypertension associated with renal dysfunction.
