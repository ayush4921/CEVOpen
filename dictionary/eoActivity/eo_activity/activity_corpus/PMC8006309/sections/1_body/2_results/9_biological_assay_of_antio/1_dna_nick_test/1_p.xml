<p>Besides antioxidant capabilities of the extracts of

 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s11">Supplementary Figures S3A,B</xref>, leaf extract of 
 <italic>S. monoica</italic> at 0.1Â mg/ml concentration, conferred 98.72% protection of the supercoiled form and 31% protection of the nicked form. Like the extracts that protected the double strand DNA, gallic acid (standard antioxidant) can effectively protect single-stranded nicked circular form from oxidative fragmentation (
