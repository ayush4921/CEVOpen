<p>This method measures the loss of color when an antioxidant is added to the blue–green chromophore ABTS·+ (2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)) and reduces it to ABTS. ABTS, a protonated radical, has characteristic absorbance maxima at 734 nm, which decreases with the scavenging capacity. The results from the ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> radical scavenging ability were found to be dose-dependent and the methanol extract proved to be an effective antioxidant (

 <sub>50</sub> values of the standard and the extracts of leaves and RS part are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6E,F</xref> respectively.
