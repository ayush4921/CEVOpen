<p>The plant anti-oxidative stress pathway comprises of two components, the non-enzymatic and the enzymatic components. The non-enzymatic component consists of antioxidants such as tocopherol, carotenoids, ascorbate and glutathione that are free-radical-scavenging molecules whereas the enzymatic component consists of enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX). All these functional elements protect the plants by scavenging the ROS generated under different types of stresses including salinity stress. SOD constitutes the first line of defense against ROS and catalyses the dismutation of the superoxide radical into H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> while CAT (tetrameric heme-containing enzymes) destroys the damaging H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> into H
 <sub>2</sub>O and O
 <sub>2</sub>. SOD, CAT, and APX activities were measured in the root, shoot and leaves of the plant. In general, it was observed that root tissues showed a higher concentration of CAT and APX activities than that of above ground tissues (
