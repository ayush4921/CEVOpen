<p>HPLC-DAD analysis is one of the best methods used for chemical profiling of plant extract in a rapid and reproducible manner. In the present study, gallic acid, quercetin, catechin, caffeic acid, rutin, 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid, kaempferol and ferulic acid were detected in selected solvent extracts of 
 <italic>S. monoica</italic> based on the comparison of retention indexes and UV-visible spectrum of individual standards analyzed under identical conditions. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref> shows the HPLC profile of various standard compounds and the merged HPLC profiles of the leaf samples, extracted with different solvents. Individual elution profiles of leaf components extracted with various solvents are depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s11">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>. The RS sample gave almost similar fingerprint with little deviations in the peak areas of various components (data not shown). Based on the analysis, gallic acid was estimated to be the most abundant compound and it was found in all the solvent extracts. Kaempferol was also present in all the extracts but in smaller amounts. Other than gallic acid, some additional signature compounds were found in one or the other solvent extracts. For example, 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid, quercetin and rutin were the signature compounds of medium polar solvent extract like acetone while catechin and ferulic acid were prominent in ethanol. Gallic acid was present at highest level in methanol, ethanol and aqueous extracts (3.5–4.25 μg/mg), moderate in acetone, ethyl acetate and DMSO extract (3.0–3.5 μg/mg) and lowest in chloroform and 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane extracts (1.5–2.0 μg/mg). However, it should be noted that gallic acid exists in plant in the form of free acids, esters, catechin derivatives and as hydrolysable tannins (at maximum level). Unless treated with enzymes like tannase, only the free form and the ester forms are extractable by solvent.
