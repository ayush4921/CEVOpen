 <italic>S. monoica</italic> plant was also found to possess significant mosquitocidal activity. In this context, plant samples are normally classified into effective (LC
 <sub>50</sub> less than 100 mg/l), less effective (LC
 <sub>50</sub> within 100 and 200 mg/l) and ineffective (LC
 <sub>50</sub> more than 200 mg/l) based on their mosquitocidal activities (

 <italic>S. monoica</italic> were found effective against the larvae of 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> with LC
 <sub>50</sub> of 49.33, 68.17, 87.21, and 98.69 mg/l, respectively. Apart from above, ethyl acetate extracts showed intermediate activity with LC
 <sub>50</sub> of 175.8 mg/l while the LC
 <sub>50</sub> of the remaining solvent extracts were ineffective with LC
 <sub>50</sub>of more than 200 mg/l. The effectiveness of the leaf sample, extracted with different solvents and tested against the larvae of
