<p>The various solvent extracts of the leaf and RS part of the plant 
 <italic>S. monoica</italic> showed different degrees of antihaemolytic property, similar to that reported for its close relative species 
 <italic>S. maritima</italic> (
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">Rashid et al., 2017</xref>). The polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and hemoglobin which are redox-active oxygen transport molecules and potent promoters for activated oxygen species mainly target the erythrocytes, the most abundant cells of human body. However, various drugs, heavy metals, food allergens, and other factors can also cause hemolysis. The magnitude of hemolysis appeared to be much more overwhelming, when red blood cells are exposed to any toxicant like hydrogen peroxide (
 <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">Woollard et al., 2009</xref>). In the present study, the antihaemolytic experiments were conducted in triplicate to assess the prevention of oxidative damages to erythrocyte membrane by 
 <italic>S. monoica</italic>. When haemolysis was induced by H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, addition of PBS without any extract supplementation showed complete haemolysis. On the other hand, when plant extracts, dissolved in PBS, were added individually, haemolysis was reduced to different extents in a dose dependent manner, depending on the nature of solvent extracts. A maximum inhibition of hemolysis (87% RBC membrane stabilization) was exhibited by methanolic extract of leaf sample at 1000 μg/ml in comparison to other solvent extracts (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Nevertheless, RS sample was also found to possess comparable activity (data not shown). 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s11">Supplementary Figure S7</xref> shows the direct antihaemolytic effects of the solvent extracts dissolved in water (without H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> induced haemolysis). Here, addition of PBS as negative control did not instigate any osmotic lysis but addition of water as positive control, did affect complete osmotic lysis of the RBC making the supernatant red in color (due to released hemoglobin). But the test samples containing plant extracts dissolved in water, turned the supernatant pale yellow to green in color, clearly reflecting the presence of molecule(s) with membrane stabilization property that prevented lysis of the RBC. These experiments also indicated that with the exception of DMSO and ethyl acetate, all other solvents were found to be capableof extracting antihaemolytic components.
