<p>Both the leaf and RS samples showed the presence of phenolics, flavonoids, terpenoids, tannins, saponins, steroids, phlobatannins, alkaloids, glycoside and reducing sugars in 
 <italic>S. monoica</italic>. Results of biochemical tests demonstrated the presence of various phytochemicals which are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s11">Supplementary Figure S1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s11">Supplementary Table S1</xref>. The FTIR spectroscopy results of various solvent extracts enabled to identify various chemical bonds/functional groups supporting the presence of different groups of biochemically identified phytochemicals

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Presence of OH stretching (3,200–3,400 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, strong, broad) and OH bending (1,330–1,420 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, medium) confirmed the presence of phenolics/alcohol group. Other important groups identified by FTIR in the different solvent extracts were C-H stretching (2,840–3,000 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, medium, sharp) for alkane, C=O stretching (1,600–1,800 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, strong) for carbonyl group containing compounds, C=C stretching (1,600–1,670 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) for alkene and C–O stretching (1,259–1,310 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) for aromatic ester group. Presence of organic sulfur and alkyl halide compounds were confirmed by the presence of S=O stretching (1,290–1,320 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) and C-halogen bond stretching (540–760 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>). Moreover, the FTIR spectra (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) showed shifting of peaks corresponding to different functional groups of various phytochemicals that were obtained with the change of polarity of the extracting solvents. Spectrum lying in the range of 3,600 and 3,200 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (assigned to -OH stretching of alcohol) showed very strong peaks in the polar aqueous and methanol solvents and very weak intensity peaks in nonpolar 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane. Another significant difference of FTIR spectra among different solvent systems was found in the spectral region of 1,600–1,670 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> that indicated presence of C=C stretching of alkene groups. Spectra in this region showed sharp peaks in polar solvents and DMSO but no significant peaks in 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane. The peaks in the region of 1,720–1,740 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> that denoted the C=O stretching of carbonyl-containing compound was prominent in nonpolar 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane but not significant in methanol and aqueous extracts. Thus, the FT-IR spectral analyses indicated a polarity-based solvent extraction at differential level of phytochemicals and that of its components containing variance in chemical bonds/functional groups.
