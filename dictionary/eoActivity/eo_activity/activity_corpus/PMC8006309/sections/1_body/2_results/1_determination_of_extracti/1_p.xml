<p>Extraction yield was highest in the polar solvents and gradually decreased with a decreasing polarity of the extracting solvents. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> shows the extraction yield of the phytochemicals in the different solvents. It appears from phytochemical extraction profile that polar solvents like water and methanol can extract phytochemicals with more efficiency than that by relatively non-polar solvents.
