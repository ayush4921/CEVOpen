<p>This method is based on the principle of increase in the absorbance of the reaction mixtures due to the presence of antioxidant molecules (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Jayaprakash et al., 2001</xref>). Here, the antioxidant molecule(s) form a colored complex upon reaction with potassium ferricyanide, trichloroacetic acid and ferric chloride, which can be quantified at 700Â nm. Here, the reduction capability of the tested plant extracts increased with increasing concentration as shown in
