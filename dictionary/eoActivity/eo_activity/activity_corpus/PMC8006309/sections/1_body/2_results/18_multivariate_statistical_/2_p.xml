<p>Further, principal component analysis was performed with IBM SPSS software to evaluate the relationship of the phytochemicals (phenolics, flavonoids, condensed tannins and saponins) with the bioactivities like LC50 values of mosquitocidal activity, IC50 value of free radical assay, IC50 value of antihaemolytic activity and MIC values against

 <italic>.</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Figures 11A,B</xref>). The correlation matrix of PCA shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Figure 11A</xref> indicated that phenolics, flavonoids, condensed tannins and antioxidants are positively correlated but saponins are negatively correlated and as such confirmed the Pearson’s and Spearmen’s correlation data. Then the bioactivities data i.e., LC50 values of mosquitocidal activity, IC50 value of free radical scavenging assay, IC50 value of antihaemolytic activity and MIC values against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> sp
 <italic>.</italic> were analyzed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Figure 11B</xref>) to show the relationship between the bioactivities and the identified phytochemicals. It was found that insecticidal property had a negative relationship with the phytochemicals and antioxidant potential but a positive relation with the saponins. Thus, the present analysis is supporting the earlier observation regarding insect killing activities of saponins. Again, loading of MIC values displayed a positive relationship with the phenolics, flavanoids and antioxidants but a negative correlation with the condensed tannins, saponins and mosquitocidal property.
