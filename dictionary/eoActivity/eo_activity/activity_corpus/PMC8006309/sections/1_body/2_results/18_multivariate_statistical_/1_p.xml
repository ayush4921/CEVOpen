<p>To understand the correlation of the phytochemical contents (total phenolics, flavonoid, saponin and tannin), Pearson’s correlation and Spearman’s correlation were evaluated among themselves. The analysis was conducted using averaged value of each variable and the correlation matrix figures are presented in

 <sub>2</sub> scavenging activity in different solvent extracts show a negative correlation with all the phytochemicals (phenolics, flavonoids and condensed tannins) present in respective solvent extracts indicating a positive relationship of the antioxidants with the above mentioned phytochemicals (as IC

In both the analyses, except saponins, however, phenolics, flavonoids and condensed tannins maintained a positive relationship among themselves. Nevertheless, the highest level of correlation was observed between phenolics and condensed tannins with
