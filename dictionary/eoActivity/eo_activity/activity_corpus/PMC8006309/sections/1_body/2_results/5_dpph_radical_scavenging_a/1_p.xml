<p>The antioxidant activities of different solvent extracts of 
 <italic>S. monoica</italic> leaves were indexed by the DPPH radical scavenging activities. Presence of an odd electron gives DPPH radical a deep purple color (
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">Ozsoy et al., 2008</xref>). When an antioxidant compound donates an electron to DPPH, the DPPH is decolorized which is quantified by noting the change in absorbance at 515 nm. The scavenging effect on DPPH radical was varied significantly with respect to different fractions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). During the DPPH radical scavenging assay, the highest scavenging activity was recorded in polar aqueous and methanol followed fractions by ethyl acetate and the least in 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane fraction. This observation is in line with other studies that polar solvents are capable of extracting more antioxidant molecules than nonpolar solvents. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values (sample concentration that produces 50% scavenging of the DPPH radical) is inversely related to its antioxidant compounds richness (lower IC
 <sub>50</sub> values indicate higher antioxidant activity) and is the amount of antioxidant required to decrease the DPPH concentration by 50%. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref> shows the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of the DPPH scavenging activities of the standard ascorbic acid and the extracts. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of various extracts were calculated from the regression equations of DPPH scavenging activity with ascorbic acid as standard (
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s11">Supplementary Figures S2A,S2D</xref>). According to 
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">Phongpaichit et al. (2007)</xref>, IC50 &gt; 250 μg/ml is considered inactive; &gt;100–250 μg/ml is considered weakly active; &gt; 50–100 μg/ml is considered moderately active; 10–50 μg/ml is considered strongly active and &lt;10 μg/ml is considered very strongly active in DPPH assay. In the present study, aqueous and methanol extracts appeared to have strong antioxidant activities and rest of the extracts have mild antioxidant activities. The plant RS extracts show almost similar profile as that of leaf extract and the IC50 values of DPPH scavenging activities are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F</xref>.
