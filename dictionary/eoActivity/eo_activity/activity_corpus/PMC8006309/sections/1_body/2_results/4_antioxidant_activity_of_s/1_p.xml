<p>Antioxidant activities of the leaves in terms of DPPH, ABTS and H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> radical scavenging activities and total reduction ability are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6Aâ€“D</xref>, while the half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) values of the free radical scavenging activities of the leaves and RS part are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6E,F</xref>. The regression graphs of both the RS and leave extracts are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s11">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values indicate that the plant polar extracts are very good radical scavengers and quite comparable with the standard ascorbic acid.
