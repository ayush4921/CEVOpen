<p>Bioautography experiment was conducted to confirm antibacterial activity present in selected extracts. The components of the extracts were first resolved by TLC. Among the different solvent systems attempted, best separation with differential banding patterns was achieved with chloroform:ethylacetate:formic acid (4:1:1, v/v/v). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref> shows TLC profile of differential banding pattern of aqueous, methanol, ethyl acetate and 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane extracts of leaf and RS parts of 
 <italic>S. monoica</italic>. While 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref> shows the bioautogram result, clearly reflecting the zone of inhibition at bands spanning at Rf values in the range of 0.90â€“0.92. The appearance of white areas against a purple background on the chromatograms indicates inhibition of growth of the bacterium 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> due to the presence of antibacterial compound(s). It may be mentioned here that actively growing microorganisms are capable of reducing INT to a purple-black color, as appeared in the background of the TLC plate. This finding further confirms the presence of antimicrobial compounds in ethyl acetate, 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane and methanol extracts.
