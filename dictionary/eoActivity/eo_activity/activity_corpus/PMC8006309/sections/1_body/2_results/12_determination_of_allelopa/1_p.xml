<p>Allelopathy is the interference that a plant exerts on other plants by the production and release of toxic compounds into the surroundings mediated by root exudates, leaf leachates and plant litter decomposition (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Arroyo et al., 2018</xref>). These compounds can directly reduce germination, growth and survival of neighboring plants because of its biological effects on cell division, membrane permeability, respiration or photosynthesis, but also indirectly by modifying the activity of associated soil microorganisms and their influence on ecosystem processes Allelopathic experiments were conducted to understand the possible reason of its distribution as monotypic species, observed at the sample collection site (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The test conducted against one representative glycophyte (
 <italic>Solanum lycopersicum L. </italic>or tomato) and a weed species (
 <italic>Amaranthus viridis L.</italic> or pigweed that can also grow in saline habitats), showed the presence of allelopathic or phytotoxic activity in the plant 
 <italic>S. monoica</italic>. Germination percentages as well as lengths and dry weights of radicals were recorded from 2nd day to 13th day of incubation. In the case of negative control, i.e., germination in the presence of water only, although 100% germination was noticed for both tomato and pigweed, germination was totally inhibited (0% germination) when supplemented with methanolic (500 μg/ml) and aqueous (500 μg/ml) extracts of the RS sample of 
 <italic>S. monoica</italic>. On the other hand, acetone extract (500 μg/ml) of the same sample, brought about 50% germination in the case of tomato and 80% germination in the case of pigweed while chloroform and 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane extracts (500 μg/ml) allowed 90% germination. In all the cases, lower concentration of extracts (10–20 μg/ml) had no adverse effects on germination. Radical lengths and dry weights were affected differentially with an increase in concentration above 20 μg/ml. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref> illustrates the effect of solvent extracts on radical lengths and dry weights of the emerged seedling on the 11th day of germination. It may be mentioned here that leaf extracts of 
 <italic>S. monoica</italic> exhibited similar type of effect like that of RS extracts (data not shown).
