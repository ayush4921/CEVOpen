<p>GC–MS analyses followed by interpretation of data based on NIST/Wiley mass spectral library search revealed the identity of highest number of compounds in methanol extract followed by 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane and ethyl acetate. Among the identified compounds, a total of 90 compounds were found to have quality score higher than 80%. All these compounds were finally selected to compare their functions with similar compounds present in literature (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Based on structural configuration, the identified compounds were classified into 12 groups. The groups of phytochemicals so identified were esters (19), carboxylic acids (10), aromatic alcohols and phenols (12), alkanes (18), heterocyclic compounds (3), alkynes (2), ketones (7), alkenes (9), aldehydes (4), amines (2), ethers (2), and alkylbenzenes (2). Nevertheless, 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> illustrates a differential presence of compounds in various solvent extracts and also depicts the association of some of these biomolecules with functions related to antimicrobial, allelopathic and mosquitocidal properties. Analysis of methanol extracted sample using polar wax column generated the most significant peak of acetic acid which was not observed from the same sample when run using the nonpolar DB-5MS column. For the sake of elucidating a quantitative estimation, based on the GC peak area, each compound was expressed as the percentage of the total compounds, and the results of all the three solvent extracted samples are displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s11">Supplementary Figure S9</xref>. The chemical structures of the major phytochemicals are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s11">Supplementary Figure S10</xref>. Thus, the GC–MS analysis of various bioactive compounds from the plant extract supported our findings on the existence of a variety of bioactivities of this plant and also justifies the use of this plant for treating various ailments by traditional practitioners.
