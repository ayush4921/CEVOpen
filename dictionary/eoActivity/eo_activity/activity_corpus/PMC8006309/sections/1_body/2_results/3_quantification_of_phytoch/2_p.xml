<p>Again, the influence of the solvents on the phytochemical extraction was evaluated based on the principle component analysis (PCA) as depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>. PCA performed in Minitab software confirmed variations in phytochemical components among different solvent extracts of 
 <italic>S. monoica</italic> leaf and RS samples. The multivariate analysis captured 85.75% variations of the total variance on a score plot constructed with the two first PCs (PC1 57.5% and PC2 28.25%). Most of the solvent extracts of leaf and RS samples clustered in one of the quadrants of the scatter plot except chloroform, ethyl acetate and 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane extracts. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, phytochemicals obtained from water, methanol, acetone and DMSO extracts are clustered together while 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane fraction maintained highest distance from this cluster.
