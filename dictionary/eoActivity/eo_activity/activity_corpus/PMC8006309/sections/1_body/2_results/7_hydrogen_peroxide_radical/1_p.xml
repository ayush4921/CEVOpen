<p>Hydroxyl radicals are extremely reactive free radicals formed in our body and rapidly decomposed into oxygen and water and this may produce hydroxyl radicals (OH·) that can initiate lipid peroxidation and cause DNA damage in the body. The scavenging ability of 
 <italic>S. monoica</italic> extracts and the positive control ascorbic acid are shown in
