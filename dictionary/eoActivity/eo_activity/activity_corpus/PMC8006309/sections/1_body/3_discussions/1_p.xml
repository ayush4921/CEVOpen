<p>In view of the emergence of chronic diseases as the major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, there is an increasing need to focus on traditional herbal medicinal plants from efficient scientific perspectives. Most of the chronic diseases (heart disease, diabetes and other ailments) are the outcomes of several etiological factors manifesting the associated ailments (
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">Pelkonen et al., 2014</xref>). However, preventing and treating these major chronic diseases by multiple drugs may lead to adverse interactions and side effects (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Hopkins et al., 2006</xref>). Consequently, it is desirable to cover multiple targets at the same time with multiple active principles at a balanced and personalized manner. Treating a complex chronic disease would require covering multiple targets, and herbal medicines, which are chemically, complex mixtures containing multiple major and minor constituents, are often able to cover multiple potential targets. Accumulating evidences suggest that application of the multiomic methods, including genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics etc., will be of immense help in revisiting traditional medicines to get new insights and will also offer opportunities for the development of new types of medicines. It is quite important to mention that Indian subcontinent is renowned for its cultural and plant biodiversity where large number of people is still depending on traditional medicinal plants for various diseases. So, before such undisclosed ethno-pharmacological information gets lost with the loss of biodiversity, it is utmost necessary to document this conventional unique information related to the ethnic population (
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">Ragupathy and Newmaster, 2009</xref>) and perform organized research to reestablish and validate the therapeutic potential of various medicinal plants that are not documented in the literature systematically. Nevertheless, an increasing research on medicinal plants has highlighted the importance of halophytes as one of the vast sources of polyphenols and other secondary metabolites that plants acquire in adaptive responses to stress conditions (
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Ksouri et al., 2012</xref>). To address the same comprehensively, the present study describes a number of investigations establishing various ethnomedicinal properties of the mangrove associate plant 
 <italic>Suaeda monoica</italic> of Indian Sundarbans. The antibacterial, antifungal, allelopathic, antioxidant, mosquitocidal, antihaemolytic and antidiuretic activities rationalized its broad therapeutic potentials and thus, should be considered as one of the distinctive medicinal plants for its huge promise as a source of medicinal hub. Antioxidant ability of plant extract as determined by chemicals assays was further substantiated by biological assays, namely, DNA nick test, catalase, superoxide dismutase and ascorbate peroxidase tests indicating strong stress relieving ability of 
 <italic>S. monoica.</italic> Again, like other halophytes, 
 <italic>S. monoica</italic> also possesses a good amount of polyphenols, comparable with other halophytic salt marsh species (
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">Patra et al., 2011</xref>). However, a differential distribution of these classes of compounds in polar and nonpolar solvent extracts based on their polarity (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) explains the manifestation of highest antioxidant potential of the plant in the polar solvent extracts that has got the active presence of higher amount of polyphenols. Further, based on the reported literature on antimicrobial compounds (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Cowan, 1999</xref>), in the present study, the phytochemicals related to antimicrobial activity were distributed in the polar ester and acid groups of compounds as well as in nonpolar alkene and alkane groups of compounds. In this context, 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane extract was shown to comprise of significant amount of 9,17-octadecadienal (4.26%), 9,12-Octadecadienoic acid (Z,Z)-, methyl ester (1.55%), 10,13-Octadecadienoic acid, methyl ester (1.55%), heneicosane (2.26%), 
 <italic>cis</italic>-3,4-dimethyl-2-phenyltetrahydro-1,4-thiazine (1.55%), octacosane (0.33%), and tetratriacontane (0.87%) which are reported as potent antimicrobial compounds (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Duke, 1992</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">Rajeswari et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Biswas et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Choudhary et al., 2018</xref>). In an analogous context, other identified phytochemicals such as acetic acid (28.14%), phenol (0.19%), methylcarbamate (0.55%), phytol (1.52%), methyl stearate (3.47%), linoleic acid (2.04%) and methenamine (0.44%), reported of having antimicrobial property are present in polar methanol extracts. On the other hand, in case of intermediate polar ethyl acetate extract, the presence of phytol (1.13%), 5-Tetradecene, (E)-(0.15%), pentadecane (0.70%), dodecanoic acid or lauric acid (0.21%), palmitic acid (7.72%), linoleic acid (0.88%), tetradecanoic acid or myristic acid (0.25%) etc have been revealed as possible antimicrobial compounds. So, at this point, we cannot pinpoint a particular compound or a group of phytochemicals responsible for the highest antimicrobial property present in the 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane extract as observed by the MIC assay. GCâ€“MS identified few phenolics compounds including phenol (0.19%), 2,6-dimethoxyphenol or syringol (0.31%), 2,4-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)phenol (1.69%), 2,6-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)phenol (0.17%), 2,4-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)phenol (0.17%) and 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol (1.26%) which share reports as potent antioxidants (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Foti, 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">Loo et al., 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Jeong and Jeong, 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, many other molecules present in 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, share reports of acting as antioxidant molecules. The different types of bioactivities including strong antihaemolytic activity must be due to rich polyphenolics content and antioxidant molecules of the plant.
