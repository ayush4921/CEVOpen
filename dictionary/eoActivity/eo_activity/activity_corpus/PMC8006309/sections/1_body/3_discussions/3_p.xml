<p>In addition to phenolics, saponins are another group of important phytochemicals, reported to possess antibacterial, antifungal and/or anti-insecticidal property (

 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Golawska et al., 2006</xref>). Saponins are amphiphilic glycosides, where the polar moieties that include sugars (pentoses, hexoses or uronic acids), are connected covalently to a nonpolar group that includes an aglycone, known as sapogenin, which can have either a streroid, alkaloid or triterpene backbone depending on the nature of the aglycone (
