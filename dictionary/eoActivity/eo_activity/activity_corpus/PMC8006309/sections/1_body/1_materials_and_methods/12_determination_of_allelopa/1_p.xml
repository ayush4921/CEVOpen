<p>Allelopathic activity was determined according to the method described by 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Bich and Kato-Noguchi (2014)</xref>. The dried solvent extracts of plant were dissolved in methanol and applied on sterile filter paper, placed in disposable petri dishes. The methanol was evaporated under fume hood and filter paper was moistened with 0.8 ml of 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20. Ten seeds of tomato (
 <italic>Solanum</italic> lycopersicum L.) and common pigweed (
 <italic>Amaranthus viridis</italic>) were surface sterilized (dipping them in 1% sodium hypochlorite for 2 min followed by rinsing with autoclaved distilled water) and placed into the petri dishes containing test material. Controls were treated exactly as described above; with the exception that 0.2 ml methanol was used instead of 
 <italic>S.</italic> extracts. Germination percentage was determined and the length of roots and shoots of the germinated seedlings were measured after 48 h of incubation in dark at 25 °C. Inhibitory activities was determined by the following formula: Inhibitory activity (%) = [(control plant length - length of plant incubated with extract)/control plant length] × 100. The dry weight and length of the seedlings were evaluated by millimeter scale. The bioassay was repeated three times using a randomized design with 10 plants and was subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA).
