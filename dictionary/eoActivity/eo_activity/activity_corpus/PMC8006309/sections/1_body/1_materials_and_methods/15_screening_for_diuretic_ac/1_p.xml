<p>The 
 <italic>S. monoica</italic> leaf extracts obtained using methanol, hexane and water extracts were evaluated for their diuretic activity and acute oral toxicity (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Hailu and Engidawork, 2014</xref>). Following relevant approval obtained from Institutional Animal Ethics Committee, initially, oral toxicity was tested in 18 Swiss albino mice weighing between 25 and 30 g (5–7 weeks old) using five different doses (250, 500, 1,000, 2,000 and 3,000 mg/kg) of aqueous extract. The mice were fed through stainless steel oral gavage needles and placed in standard metabolic cages. The health of test group was compared with the control group, who were fed with equivalent amount of saline water only. The animals were then observed for overt toxicities like diarrhea, weight loss, tremor, lethargy and paralysis, periodically, for every 4 h during the 24 h period and then further monitored for 14 days for any lethality. As none of the doses appeared lethal or showed any toxicity, three lower doses of 250, 500 and 1,000 mg/kg were selected for diuretic test. Here, 33 Swiss albino mice were divided into three groups. Of which, Group I and Group II had 3 mice each, representing negative control and positive control, respectively. While Group 3, the test group had 27 mice and were divided into three subgroups each having 9 mice for three different extracts (aqueous, methanol and hexane) and three different doses (250, 500 and 1,000 mg/kg). The experimental mice were denied food for 24 h. The negative control group received normal saline and positive control group received standard drug Furosemide (10 mg/kg body weight) at a rate of 2 ml/100 g of body weight. After feeding, they were administered saline water again (2 ml/100 g body weight). The cumulative urine excreted over 5 h periods from all the groups were collected in sterile containers and stored at −20°C until further analysis. Samples showing significant differences from the control set were used for flame photometric determination of sodium, potassium and chlorine ions. In addition, total urine volume, urinary electrolyte concentration of Na
 <sup>+</sup>, K
 <sup>+</sup> and Cl
 <sup>−</sup>, diuretic action (urinary excretion of treatment groups/urinary excretion of negative control group), diuretic activity (diuretic action of test drug or plant crude extract/diuretic action of standard drug), urinary excretion [(total urinary output/total liquid administered) × 100%], saluretic activity, natriuretic activity and carbonic anhydrase inhibition were determined (
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Lahlou et al., 2007</xref>). The amount of Na
 <sup>+</sup> and K
 <sup>+</sup> was calculated as a parameter for the saluretic activity while the ratio of Na
 <sup>+</sup>/K
 <sup>+</sup> was calculated for the natriuretic activity. To estimate the carbonic anhydrase inhibition activity, the ratio of Cl
 <sup>−</sup>/(Na
 <sup>+</sup> + K
 <sup>+</sup>) was calculated (
