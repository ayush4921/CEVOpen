<p>Hydrogen peroxide (H

 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Fernando and Soysa (2015)</xref>. Briefly, water extracts of 
 <italic>S. monoica</italic> (4–64 mg/ml) were added to 0.6 ml H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> solution (40 mM, in phosphate buffer, pH 7.4). The reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 10 min and read at 230 nm against the blank solution with phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Ascorbic acid was taken as a standard. The inhibition percentage was calculated based on the formula: Percentage (%) of inhibition = (A1 − A2)/A1 × 100. Where, A1 is the absorbance of the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and A2 is the absorbance of the reaction mixture with the extract.
