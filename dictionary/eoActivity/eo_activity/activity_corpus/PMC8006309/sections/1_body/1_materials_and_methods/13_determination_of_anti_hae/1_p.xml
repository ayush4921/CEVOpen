<p>Following approval from Institutional Human Ethics Committee, blood samples (5 ml each) were obtained from six healthy human consented volunteers, who had no report of using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for last 4 weeks. The blood cells were centrifuged at 1,000
 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min, washed with 0.2 M phosphate-buffered Saline (PBS), and reconstituted as 10% suspension in 0.5% saline (10 times volume with respect to the original). The suspension was mixed with two different concentrations (500 and 1,000 μg/ml) of the plant extracts dissolved in PBS. The reaction was incubated at 37°C for 10 min. Then 0.5 ml of 0.3% H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (prepared in PBS) was added in each tube and the reaction mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 2 h. The supernatant was collected by spinning down the mixture at 1,000
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min. The hemoglobin content of the supernatant was determined by measuring absorbance at 540 nm. One negative control was used where 500 µl extract was replaced with 500 µl of PBS. The percent of haemolysis and membrane stabilization was measured by the following formula: Haemolysis % = (Absorbance of test sample/Absorbance of control) × 100 and inhibition of haemolysis or membrane stabilization % = 100 − [(Absorbance of test sample/Absorbance of control) × 100]. Absorbance of the samples was also measured without addition of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> to evaluate the direct haemolytic effect of the crude extracts. In this case, water and PBS were used as positive and negative control, respectively and extracts were dissolved in water.
