<p>Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrum was used to identify the chemical bonds/functional groups of the components of plant extract based on the peak value ratio. 10 mg of the dried extract powder of leaf and RS samples, extracted with different solvents were encapsulated in 100 mg of KBr pellet in order to prepare translucent sample discs. The powdered sample was loaded onto FTIR spectroscope and scanned in the range of 400–4,000 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> at a resolution of 4 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>.
