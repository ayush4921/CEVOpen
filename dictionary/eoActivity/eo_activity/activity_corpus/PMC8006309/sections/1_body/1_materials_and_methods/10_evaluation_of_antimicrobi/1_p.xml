<p>Both antibacterial and antifungal assays were performed by preliminary plate-based screening and microdilution assay. For preliminary screening of antibacterial activity, agar well diffusion assay was performed (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Chouhan et al., 2017</xref>) and zone of inhibition was determined. For preliminary screening of antifungal activity, the plant extract was mixed with the melted Sabouraud Dextrose agar (40°C) and then poured into petri plates. Negative control plates contained equivalent amount of solvent. When no more smell of solvent was there, small mycelial blocks were cut from the parent culture dishes and placed over the test and control plates. The plates were then incubated at 28°C for 72 h and checked for the diameter of the fungal growth in the control and test plates.
