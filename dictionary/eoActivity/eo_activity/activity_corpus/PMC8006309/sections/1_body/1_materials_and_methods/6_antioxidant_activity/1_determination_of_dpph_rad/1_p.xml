<p>Method of 
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">Truong et al. (2019)</xref> was followed for the determination of the antioxidant activity by DPPH. The extract was serially diluted to attain concentrations of 25, 50, 100 and 150 μg/ml. One ml of each dilution was mixed with 1 ml of DPPH solution (0.004% in ethanol) and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The absorbance of the mixture was then measured spectrophotometrically at 517 nm. Absolute ethanol was used as a negative control. DPPH scavenging activity was calculated as follows: DPPH scavenging activity (%) = [(A
 <sup>0</sup>–A)/A
 <sup>0</sup>] × 100. Where, A is the absorbance of extract and A
 <sup>0</sup> is the absorbance of the negative control (0.004% DPPH solution). Ascorbic acid was used as a positive control. The concentration required for a 50% inhibition of DPPH (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) was then calculated by plotting the percentage of residual DPPH against the sample concentration.
