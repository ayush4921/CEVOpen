<p>Superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1) enzyme activity was assayed by the method of 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Beauchamp and Fridovich (1971)</xref> based on the inhibition of the photochemical reduction of nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT). A reaction mixture containing 200 μl of 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 300 μl of 12 mM methionine, 300 μl of 75 μM NBT, 1 ml of 50 mM Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> and 300 μl of enzyme extract was added to test mixture. In control experiment, 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) was added instead of enzyme extract. At the end, 30 μl of 1 μM riboflavin was added and the tubes were shaken and placed under a fluorescent lamp. The reaction was allowed to run for 15 min and then the tubes were immediately covered with black cloth. The absorbance was recorded at 560 nm. The non-irradiated reaction mixture kept as additional control that did not develop any color. In the test samples, due to the presence of SOD, the reaction was inhibited and the amount of inhibition was used to quantify the enzyme activity. One unit of enzyme activity corresponds to the enzyme extract volume that inhibits 50% of the photochemical reaction. The specific enzyme activity was estimated as unit per mg of protein.
