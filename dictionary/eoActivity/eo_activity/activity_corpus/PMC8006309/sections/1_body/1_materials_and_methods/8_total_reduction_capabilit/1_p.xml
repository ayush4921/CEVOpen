Stock solutions of samples were prepared by dissolving 10 mg of dried extracts in 10 ml of methanol to give a concentration of 1 mg/ml and subsequently diluted to prepare solutions with sample concentrations of 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 μg/ml. Samples (1 ml each) was mixed with 2.5 ml of 0.2 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.6) and 2.5 ml of 1% potassium ferricyanide and mixed gently. The mixture was incubated at 50°C in a water bath for 20 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 2.5 ml of 10% TCA and the mixture was centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 10 min. From the top layer, 2.5 ml was transferred into a tube containing 2.5 ml distilled water and 0.5 ml of 0.1% ferric chloride (FeCl
