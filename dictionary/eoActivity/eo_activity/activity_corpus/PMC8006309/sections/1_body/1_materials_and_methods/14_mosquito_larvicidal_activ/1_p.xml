<p>The larvicidal activity of the crude extracts of 
 <italic>S. monoica</italic> leaf and RS parts were tested based on the method recommended by the 
 <xref rid="B126" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization (WHO) (2005)</xref>. Twenty-five fourth instar larvae of 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> were transferred to plastic cups containing 249 ml of water and 1.0 ml of the desired plant extract in appropriate dilutions (10–500 mg/l). An equal number of controls were set up simultaneously using tap water. Dead larvae were counted following 24 h post-treatment, and the percent mortality was reported from the average of three replicates using the formula: Percentage of mortality = Number of death larvae/Number of larvae introduced × 100. The LC50 (lethal concentration that kills 50% of the exposed larvae) and LC90 (lethal concentration that kills 90% of the exposed larvae) values were calculated based on mortality data by using probit analysis according to Abbott’s formula (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Abbott, 1925</xref>). Percentage of mortality = Number of death larvae/Number of larvae introduced × 100. Statistical significance was measured by one-way ANOVA from triplicate experimental outcome.
