<p>Phytochemical constituents of the plant extract were analyzed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) as described by 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Elisha et al. (2017)</xref> using chloroform:ethyl acetate:formic acid (8:1:1, v/v/v). Plates were visualized under UV light and Rf values of the bands were calculated by dividing the distance migrated by the bands with the distance migrated by the solvent front from the point of application. For bioautography, the developed plates were sprayed with the MHB broth-grown overnight culture of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and incubated overnight at 37°C. After incubation, plates were sprayed with 2 mg/ml solution of INT and further incubated for 2–4 h at 37°C. Clear zones on the chromatograms indicated inhibition of growth by the separated antimicrobial compounds.
