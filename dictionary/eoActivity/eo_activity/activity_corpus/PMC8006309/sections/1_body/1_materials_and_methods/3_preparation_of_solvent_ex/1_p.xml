<p>The powdered plant samples (5 g each) were extracted with different solvents (250 ml each). The selected solvents with decreasing polarity index level were: water (10.2), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 7.2), methanol (5.1), acetone (5.1), ethyl acetate (4.4), chloroform (2.7), and hexane (0.1). Samples were prepared by both Soxhlet extraction (2.5 g) and maceration (2.5 g) to ensure maximum extraction of the majority of the compounds irrespective of heating. In the maceration method, the sample was dissolved in respective solvents, incubated for 4 days at room temperature with constant stirring in an orbital stirrer, and then filtered with Whatman filter paper. The filtrate solvent obtained from maceration was mixed with Soxhlet extracted solvent and evaporated to dryness in a rotary evaporator. However, for samples extracted with water or DMSO, the solvent part was lyophilized to dryness. The dried extract from original 5 g sample was then dissolved in 5 ml of methanol or suitable solvent. The extraction yield (%) was calculated as follows: Extraction yield (%) = (weight of the extract after evaporation of the solvent or freeze dried weight of the sample/dry weight of the sample) × 100.</p>
