<p>Both the human and animal studies were reviewed and approved by respective Human and Animal Ethics Committee.Antifungal activity was performed against 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic>, 
 <italic>Alternia solani</italic> and 
 <italic>Pleospora herbarum</italic> in Sabouraud Dextrose agar. CzapekDox broth was used instead of MHB and before performing the test; fungal spore suspensions were prepared and used to achieve desired dilutions according to method described by 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Eloff (1998)</xref>. After 48–72 h of incubation, 20 µl of 0.02% filter sterilized INT [2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-phenyl-2
 <italic>H</italic>-tetrazolium)] solution was added and incubated for another 24 h and observed for the formation of red colored formazan compounds in wells showing fungal growth. While colorless test wells were supposed to indicate antifungal activities of extracts, MIC values were recorded as the lowest concentrations that inhibited fungal growth after 48 h of incubation. To determine the minimum fungicidal concentrations (MFC), 50 μl of sterile Czapek-Dox broth was added to all the clear wells and further incubated at 30°C for 24 h. Then, 20 μl was plated from each well and incubated for further 72 h. The MFC was regarded as the lowest extract concentration that did not yield any fungal growth on the solid medium used.
