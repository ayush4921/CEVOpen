<p>GC separation was performed by using a Thermo Scientific model with a model PolarisQ mass spectrometer at a constant flow of helium (1 ml/min). Initial oven temperature was set to 70°C and a hold for 1 min, followed by a ramp to 76°C at 1°C/min, a second ramp at 6°C/min to 350°C and a hold at 350°C for 1 min. The post run temperature was set to 325°C while the ion source was kept at 250°C and both the inlet temperature and the transfer line temperatures were kept at 340°C. Mass analyzer was used in full scan mode, scanning a range from m/z 40–800 at a scan time of 250 ms. Mass spectrometer was operated at an electron ionization energy of 70 eV. Nonpolar Durabond DB-5MS column (30 m length, 0.25 μm film thicknesses, 0.25 mm I.D, Agilent J&amp;W) was used for the analysis of various solvent extracted samples. In addition, for methanol extracted sample, polar DB Wax column (Agilent J&amp;W) was also used for the analysis of polar compounds. The interpretation of mass spectral data was made based on the combined Wiley Registry 11th edition/NIST 2017 Mass Spectral Library attached to the GC–MS instrument, which is one of the most comprehensive mass spectral libraries, having more than 973,000 searchable chemical structures and over 770,000 unique compounds. The criterion for peak assignment was adopted when a match quality value was higher than 80%. Moreover, the fragmentation patterns of the reported constituents were also compared with available published data.</p>
