<p>Catalase (CAT, EC 1.11.1.6) activity was determined according to 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Aebi (1984)</xref>. A reaction mixture was set up with 2,450 μl of 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), and 500 μl of 10 mM H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>. Reaction was started with the addition of 50 μl of enzyme extract and the decrease in absorbance was recorded at 240 nm. Specific activity of the enzyme was expressed as mM H
