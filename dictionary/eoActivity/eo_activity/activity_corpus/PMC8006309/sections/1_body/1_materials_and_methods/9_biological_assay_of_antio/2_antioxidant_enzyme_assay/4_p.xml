<p>Ascorbate peroxidase (APX, EC 1.11.1.11) activity was measured by the method of 
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">Nakano and Asada (1981)</xref>. 50 μl of the enzyme extract was added into a reaction mixture containing 680 μl of 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 100 μl of 10 mM EDTA and 100 μl of 10 mM ascorbic acid. Reaction was initiated with the addition of 100 μl of 100 mM H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>. The decrease of absorbance was monitored at 290 nm and specific activity was calculated as mmol ascorbate oxidized mg
 <sup>−1</sup> of soluble protein min
 <sup>−1</sup> with 2.8 mM
 <sup>−1</sup> cm
 <sup>−1</sup> as extinction coefficient.
