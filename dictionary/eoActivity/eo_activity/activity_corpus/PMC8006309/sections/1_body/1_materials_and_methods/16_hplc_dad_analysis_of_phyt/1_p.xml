<p>High performance liquid chromatography with diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) was performed to identify different classes of phenolic compounds that have characteristic UV–visible spectral properties. Dried solvent extracts (0.5 g) were dissolved in HPLC grade methanol (1 ml) and run in a HPLC system (Shimadzu Corp, Japan) along with the standards of phenolic acids (gallic acid, caffeic acid, syringic acid, 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid and ferulic acid) and flavonoids (rutin, myricetin, quercetin and kaempferol) prepared at 10 mg/ml concentrations in methanol. Compounds were separated by an analytical Phenomenex C
 <sub>18</sub> reverse-phase column (250 ×4.6 mm, particle size 5 µm), attached to a model SIL-20A autosampler and detected by a diode array model SIL-M20A detector. Solvent A (0.05% TFA in acetonitrile) and solvent B (0.05% TFA in water) were used as mobile phases. Optimized gradient elution was performed using the following program: 5–25% A (0–30 min), 25–40% A (30–40 min), 40–63% A (40–50 min) and 63–5% A (50–60 min). The flow rate was set at 1.0 ml/min, injection volume was 20 μl, and the detector wavelength was set at 254 nm (

Quantitative profile was generated for gallic acid as it is one of the most abundant compounds in all the extracts. Quantification of gallic acid was done following method of
