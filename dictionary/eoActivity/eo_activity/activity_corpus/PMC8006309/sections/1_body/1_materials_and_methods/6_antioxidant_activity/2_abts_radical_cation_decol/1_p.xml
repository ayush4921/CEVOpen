<p>The ABTS radical cation scavenging ability was determined by following the method of 
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">Re et al. (1999)</xref> with the slight modification. ABTS radical cation was produced by incubating the mixture of 7 mM ABTS and 2.45 mM ammonium persulfate, overnight at room temperature in the dark. To determine the ABTS radical cation scavenging activity, 3 ml of ABTS radical cation solution was mixed thoroughly with 0.2 ml of different concentration (10–100 μg/ml) of plant extracts. Ascorbic acid was used as positive control. The reaction mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature for 6 min and then absorbance was measured at 745 nm. The percentage inhibition was calculated by the following formula: Percentage (%) of inhibition = [Absorbance of control–Absorbance of sample/Absorbance of control] × 100. The radical scavenging activity was expressed by IC
 <sub>50</sub> value, calculated based on the concentration required for scavenging 50% of ABTS radical cation.
