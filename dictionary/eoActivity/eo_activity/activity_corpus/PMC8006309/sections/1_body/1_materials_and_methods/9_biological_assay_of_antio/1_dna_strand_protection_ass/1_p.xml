<p>For DNA nick test, reaction mixture was set up using 3 μl of supercoiled plasmid DNA (150 ng/μl), 10 μl of a Fenton reagent (30 mM hydrogen peroxide, 100 μM ferric chloride and 100 μM ascorbic acid) and 5 μl of plant leaf extract (0–100 μg/ml) or gallic acid (0–5 μM), volume adjusted to 20 μl by phosphate buffer (8.3 mM, pH 7.5). Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 30 min and plasmid DNA forms were separated on 0.7% agarose gels. After completion of run at 100 W, bands were visualized in Gel Doc XR system (Bio-Rad, US). Intensity of DNA bands were quantified by Quantity One
 <sup>®</sup>—Bio-Rad. Plasmid DNA incubated with Fenton reagent served as negative control while plasmid DNA incubated with the Fenton reagent and Gallic acid served as positive control. DNA protection activities of the samples were calculated from amount of supercoiled and nicked plasmid DNA using the following equations (
