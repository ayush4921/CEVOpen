<p>Both the dried leaf and RS powder extracts, prepared in different solvents were used for the qualitative detection of the phytochemicals like phenolics, alkaloid, tannin, saponin, flavonoid, cardiac glycoside, sterol, reducing sugar, pholobatannin and steroids by established protocols (

Total phenolic content (TPC) was calculated from the calibration curve of gallic acid and expressed as mg of gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g of dry sample. The tannin content was expressed as mg of GAE/g of dry sample. In all cases, the standard curves showed the linear regression of

 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Ejikeme et al. (2014)</xref>. Butanol was added in the last phase of the extraction and the extracted samples were dried in a lyophilizer and the weight was measured. Each experiment was carried out in triplicates and the two-way ANOVA was used to measure statistical significance.
