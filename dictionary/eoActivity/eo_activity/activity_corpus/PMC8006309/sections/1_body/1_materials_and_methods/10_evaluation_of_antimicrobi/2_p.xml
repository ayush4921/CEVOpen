<p>96-Well microtitre plate-based microdilution method of 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Eloff (1998)</xref> was used for the determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of antibacterial and antifungal activity. For the determination of antibacterial activity, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ATCC 25922)
 <italic>, Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (ATCC 12600), 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumonia</italic> (ATCC 700603) and carbapenem resistant 
 <italic>K. pneumonia</italic> (ATCC BAA1705) obtained from the Microbial Type Culture Collection (IMTECH, Chandigarh, India) were used. Overnight grown bacterial strains were diluted with sterile Mueller–Hinton broth (MHB) to give an OD
 <sub>600</sub> of 0.08–0.12. This was again diluted 1,000 fold to make 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> CFU/ml 100 μl sterile MHB medium was added in each well of a 96-well plate. 100 μl of plant extracts (1,000 mg/ml) dissolved in methanol was added to the first well and mixed thoroughly. Then 100 µl from the first column was added in the second resulting a two-fold serial dilution and this process were continued up to 11th column (where 100 µl was discarded from the 11th column). A similar two-fold serial dilution of gentamycin (0.1 mg/ml) was used as a positive control. 100 μl of methanol was included as negative or sterility control. Finally, all wells except the wells of 12th column (negative control) received 100 µl of diluted culture. The plates were covered with parafilm and wet paper towels (to minimize evaporation) and incubated at 30°C for 24 h. Finally, 0.02% resazurin was added to indicate growth and the plates were further incubated at 30°C for 2 h. In the case of resazurin, a color gradient from violet to pink indicates increase in number of viable cells. MIC values were recorded as the concentrations in the last wells in which no color transformation in the range of blue to violet was noticed. To determine the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), 5 µl content from each well showing no growth were inoculated on MHB agar media aseptically and incubated at 37°C for 24 h and checked for the presence of growth. The lowest concentration of the extract that showed no bacterial growth following incubation was noted as the MBC.
