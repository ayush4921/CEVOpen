<p>The traditional practices of using 
 <italic>S. monoica</italic> to treat several ailments have been explored systematically by performing a number of activity screening experiments with the solvent extracts of the leaf and root-shoot tissues of the plant. In the present study, a broad range of medicinal property was exhibited by this phytomedicinal plant and a polarity-based distribution of plant components in various solvents revealed a differential level of bioactivities. Further the bioactivities were supported by chemometric identification of a number of individual and classes of compounds that were reported as phytochemicals from various other plants and identified as bioactive molecules. Thus, a combination of antibacterial, antifungal, allelopathic, antioxidant, mosquitocidal, antihaemolytic and antidiuretic potentials present in a single plant 
 <italic>S. monoica</italic> is quite significant, providing scientific justifications to the folkloric uses of this halophytic plant. Finally, being a rich source of many bioactive compounds, this lesser known ethnomedicinal plant should be explored further for potential application in the pharmaceutical and nutraceutical fields.
