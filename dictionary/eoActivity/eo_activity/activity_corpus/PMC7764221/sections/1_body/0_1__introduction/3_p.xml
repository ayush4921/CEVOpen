 <italic>Nigella sativa</italic>, black seed, black caraway, black cumin, kalojeera, kalonji, or kalanji in combination with periodontal disease, periodontal regeneration, periodontal therapy, periodontal treatment, or periodontitis were entered into PubMed, MEDLINE, Google Scholar and the Cochrane database. The hierarchical system of evidence-based medicine was then applied within the review. Laboratory-based experiments, in vivo animal studies and clinical investigations were identified and reported in the review. This investigation was not planned to be a systematic review and consequently recommendations were not made as such. As more research is needed currently in this area, this article tries to use the best available evidence to demonstrate the scientific status of the topic and the need for more studies to expand the current knowledge.
