<p>Periodontal disease is a multifactorial pathophysiological process described by an inflammation of periodontal host tissues mediated by the immune response and linked to dysbiotic plaque biofilms, consequently destroying the tooth-supporting apparatus progressively and allowing the loss of periodontal attachment [

 <xref rid="B85-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Following a gingival inflammation initiated by bacterial biofilm formation, dysbiotic ecological changes in the microbiome arise, responding to inflammatory and tissue breakdown products and immune responses and leading to the activation of several key molecular pathways promoting periodontal destruction. This mechanism finally activates host-derived proteases enabling the loss of marginal periodontal ligament fibers, junctional epithelium apical migration, concomitant with an apical spread of the microbial biofilm along the root surface [
