<p>The goal of periodontal therapy is to resist the microbial infection and rearrange the configurations and functions of the periodontium [
 <xref rid="B97-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. Difficult tasks persist in regenerating the periodontal structures and constructing bone-PDL-cementum complex concurrently [
 <xref rid="B98-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Osteogenesis slightly precedes the cementum and periodontal ligament fibers differentiation. Subsequently, the oriented periodontal ligament fibers require to be attached to novel generated alveolar bone and cementum tissue, which is considered one of the most challenging processes in periodontal regeneration [
 <xref rid="B99-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. In recent years, numerous investigators discussed the high potential of periodontal regeneration with noticeable clinical success through mechanisms of regeneration for bone, cementum and PDL by mobilization of endogenous stem cells from their niches or transplanting exogenous stem cells targeting the periodontal defects [
 <xref rid="B99-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Numerous mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) types persist and are accountable for homeostasis of the tissues, serving as a spring of renewable stem/progenitor cells to produce other essential cells throughout adult life [
 <xref rid="B100-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Consequently, a successful periodontal regeneration depends on recruitment of locally-derived stem/progenitor cells, such as populations of resident periodontal or oral-tissue stem/progenitor cells, to the defect site for tissue homeostasis and succeeding differentiation into bone, periodontal ligament and cementum-forming cells [

 <xref rid="B101-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Several studies have observed the modulating effects of natural herbs and compounds on the immune functions, migration, proliferation, cell fate determination and self-renewal abilities or “stemness” of various types of mesenchymal stem cells [

 <xref rid="B103-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Among these studies, TQ and NS have displayed various effects that might influence the periodontal therapy and play a role in better regeneration and healing [

 <xref rid="B107-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. As explained in the investigations [
 <xref rid="B104-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>], TQ could activate c-MET and CXCR4 signaling pathways, promoting MSCs migration. TQ was correspondingly able to expand MSC immunomodulatory potential, as well as self-renewal ability and “stemness” by influencing the associated gene expression in vivo and in vitro [

 <xref rid="B105-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Other experiments observed the significantly increased therapeutic potential and healing ability of MSCs after administration of NS extract to the damaged sites [

 <xref rid="B108-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Such results may indicate a great regenerative accelerating potential of NS and TQ mediators if administered adjunctively to periodontal therapy. Nevertheless, more in vitro and in vivo investigations are needed, especially on periodontal ligament stem cells as major residents of periodontal defects to confirm and expand the knowledge about these potential advantages of NS and TQ (
