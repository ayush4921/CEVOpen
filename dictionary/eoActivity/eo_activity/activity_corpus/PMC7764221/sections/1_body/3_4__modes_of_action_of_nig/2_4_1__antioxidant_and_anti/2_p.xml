<p>In the animal investigation proposed in one of the in vivo studies an assessment of the possible protective role of TQ on periodontal and gingival inflammation was performed [

The outcomes displayed that rats treated with TQ in their drinking water or as an oral gel had significantly lower values of periodontal indices and inflammatory clinical parameters in comparison to the control group. Histological investigation of their mandibular tissues correspondingly demonstrated no inflammatory signs in contrary to their controls. Another rat periodontitis model reported the preventive role of TQ in the initiation and progression of periodontal inflammation [
 <xref rid="B66-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Ratsâ€™ molars gingival margins were ligated with a 4/0 silk suture to initiate periodontal inflammation. The trial involved 24 rats randomly and equally scattered into non-ligated, ligature only and ligature with TQ treatment (10 mg/kg gastric feeding) groups. After 11 days, the rats were sacrificed to examine the alveolar bone levels of the molars clinically and histologically.
