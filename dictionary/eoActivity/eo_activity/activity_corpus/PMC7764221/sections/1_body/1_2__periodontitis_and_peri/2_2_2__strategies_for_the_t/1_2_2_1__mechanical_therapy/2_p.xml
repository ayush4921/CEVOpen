<p>Scaling and root planning can be completed by different periodontal instruments, such as hand scalers and curettes, or sonic and ultrasonic tools that enhance the competence of the periodontist to reach into dental root furcations and through the pocket depths effectively [

During the localized therapy of scaling and root planning it is not always possible to eliminate all pathogenic microorganisms due to their existence within periodontal tissues, or in very deep pockets that might be hard to reach by instruments. This led to the introduction of the adjunctive combination of antimicrobial and chemotherapeutic agents beside the main mechanical periodontal debridement to improve the microbiological profile and control the periodontal inflammation and regeneration [

Features as the ability to excise, evaporate and sterilize periodontal pockets allow the laser treatment to be applied as an adjunct or alternative to regular mechanical periodontal treatment. Nevertheless, more research has to be performed to investigate the bacterial recolonization after laser therapy in periodontal disease [
