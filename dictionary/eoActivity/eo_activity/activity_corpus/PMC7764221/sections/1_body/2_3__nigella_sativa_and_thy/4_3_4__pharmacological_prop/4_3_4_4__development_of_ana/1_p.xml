<p>Several investigations have explored the development of TQ analog compounds with notable efficacy for different types of diseases [

These analogues possessed the ability to inhibit (HMG-CoA) reductase and stimulate each of plasma LPL and LCAT enzymes concomitantly. Although some investigations presented a more prominent therapeutic effect of the synthetic mediators than natural TQ, traditionally extracted
