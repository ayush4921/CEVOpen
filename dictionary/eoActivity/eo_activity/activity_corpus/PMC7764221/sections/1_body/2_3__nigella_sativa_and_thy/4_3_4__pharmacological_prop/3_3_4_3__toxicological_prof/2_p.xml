<p>In one of the investigations the LD
 <sub>50</sub> value of TQ was observed to be 10 mg/kg after intraperitoneal injection in rats, while the same route of administration in mice at doses of 4, 8, 12.5, 25 and 50 mg/kg exhibited no effects on biochemical indices, such as lactate dehydrogenase or serum alanine transaminase. Nevertheless, intraperitoneal injections of TQ in mice with doses higher than 50 mg/kg had lethal outcomes [

 <xref rid="B73-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>].The maximum tolerated dose of intraperitoneal injected TQ in rats was 22.5 mg/kg in males and 15 mg/kg in females, while oral administration of TQ in both genders exhibited a higher maximum tolerated dose of 250 mg/kg [

This discrepancy in toxicity response between both routes of TQ administration can be attributed to a complete TQ absorption into the blood circulation after intraperitoneal injection, while in the oral route of administration, TQ is first bio-transformed in the gastrointestinal tract and metabolized in the liver [

In terms of potential genotoxicity and effects on embryonic development, it was also reported that TQ could possibly disrupt the embryonic development during the second trimester in rats and might cause chromosomal aberrations if its concentrations exceeded 80 mg/kg [

Further toxicity studies concluded that treatment with TQ can significantly induce oxidative effects, reduce cellular glutathione (GSH), elevate malondialdehyde (MDA) production and catalase (CAT) activity and also trigger p53 in a concentration and time-dependent way in various types of cells [
