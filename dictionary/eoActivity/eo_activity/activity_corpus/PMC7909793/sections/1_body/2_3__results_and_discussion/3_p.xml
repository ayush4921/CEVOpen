<p>The cluster analysis of the 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> varieties in this work revealed two well-defined groups. One group (varieties CL5, CL9, and CL11) was dominated by turmerones (α-turmerone, 
 <italic>ar</italic>-turmerone, and β-turmerone). The second group demonstrated lower concentrations of turmerones, but higher concentrations of other components (e.g., α-zingiberene and β-phellandrene). Previous examination of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> rhizome essential oils from India as well as other geographical locations showed there to be four clusters based on the relative concentrations of the turmerones [
 <xref rid="B14-foods-10-00212" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]: (1) dominated by turmerones, but with relatively large concentrations of other components; (2) dominated by turmerones, especially 
 <italic>ar</italic>-turmerone; (3) dominated by turmerones, especially α-turmerone; and (4) very large concentrations of 
 <italic>ar</italic>-turmerone. The chemical compositions of varieties CL5, CL9, and CL11 placed them into the cluster dominated by turmerones (i.e., cluster 2 of [
 <xref rid="B14-foods-10-00212" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]), while varieties CL3 and CL10 had relatively lower concentrations of turmerones with relatively larger concentrations of components other than turmerones (i.e., cluster 1 of [
 <xref rid="B14-foods-10-00212" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]). Thus, the essential oil compositions of these turmeric varieties adaptable to the Alabama summer growing season fit in well with essential oil compositions of turmeric varieties cultivated in Asia. The 
 <italic>ar</italic>-turmerone and α-turmerone levels were similar to (CL3) or greater than (CL5, CL9, and CL11) those reported for turmeric grown in a tropical country, Brazil [
 <xref rid="B23-foods-10-00212" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The 
 <italic>ar</italic>-turmerone and α-turmerone were substantially greater than those reported for turmeric grown in India [
 <xref rid="B24-foods-10-00212" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The β-turmerone levels were generally lower than those reported for turmeric grown in tropical countries [
 <xref rid="B22-foods-10-00212" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-foods-10-00212" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-foods-10-00212" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], but similar to those reported for turmeric grown in Korea [
 <xref rid="B25-foods-10-00212" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The cluster analysis also showed very little dissimilarity between the mother rhizome essential oil and the lateral rhizome essential oils for each of the varieties.
