<p>Xu and coworkers examined the extracts of 160 samples of

Gas chromatographic analysis of the volatiles from the extracts revealed three volatile profile types, while high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) analysis showed three types based on curcuminoid content. Unfortunately, Xu et al. identified only 10 volatile components, whereas 79 components were identified in our essential oil work. Furthermore, percent compositions were not reported and only “representative” chromatograms were presented. Nevertheless, although comparison is tenuous, based on the chromatograms, the volatile profile types identified seem to be analogous to essential oil types in our work. Importantly, volatile profile types “a” and “b” correspond to high-curcuminoid type “B” [
