<p>Agglomerative hierarchical cluster (AHC) analysis was carried out using the chemical compositions of the 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> rhizome essential oils. The compositions were treated as operational taxonomic units, with the percentages of the 16 most abundant components (α-turmerone, 
 <italic>ar</italic>-turmerone, β-turmerone, α-phellandrene, 1,8-cineole, α-zingiberene, β-sesquiphellandrene, terpinolene, (6

 <italic>ar</italic>-curcumene, β-bisabolene, 7-
 <italic>epi-trans</italic>-sesquisabinene hydrate, limonene, and 
 <italic>ar</italic>-tumerol), using XLSTAT Premium, version 2018.1.1.62926. Euclidean distance was used to determine dissimilarity, and Ward’s method was used to define the clusters.
