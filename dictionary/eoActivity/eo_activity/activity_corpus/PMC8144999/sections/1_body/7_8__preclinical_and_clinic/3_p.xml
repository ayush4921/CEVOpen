<p>The sedative and anticonvulsant effects of 
 <italic>V. edulis</italic> and several valerian extracts are often related to high dosages and the different phytochemical compounds such as valerenic acids and flavonoids, present in the different Valerian species. In vivo experimental models confirmed that valerenic acid and valerian extracts have shown sedative effects [

 <sub>A</sub> receptors that showed a high affinity for valerenol and valerenic acid. Several previous studies demonstrated that the properties of valerian are related not only by the interaction with GABAA receptors but also by the involvement of adenosine receptors [
