<p>Although valerian has traditionally been used as a mild sedative, research results are still controversial today regarding the role of the different active compounds, the herbal preparations, and the dosage used [

 <xref rid="B145-plants-10-00846" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>]. In fact, in vivo studies, showed that valerian can be used as an anti-depressant [

 <xref rid="plants-10-00846-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). In particular, as abovementioned the neurobiological mechanisms of the different bioactive compounds in Valerianaceae species can be due to the effects on GABA, serotoninergic, dopaminergic, noradrenergic, and adenosine A1 receptors [

 <italic>V. glechomifolia</italic> extract containing 96% of valepotriates (10 mg/kg) showed anxiolytic and sedative properties reducing exploratory and behavior locomotion during open field exploration without affecting memory test. Otherwise the dose of 3 mg/kg 
 <italic>V. glechomifolia</italic> selectively influenced the recognition memory without effects on other behavioral parameters [

 <italic>V. glechomifolia</italic> in mice also appears to be due to the interaction with noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission. The extract of 
 <italic>V. glechomifolia</italic> can enhance its antidepressant effects such as imipramine, desipramine, and bupropion without involving the neurotransmission of serotonin and activating the noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems [

 <italic>V. prionophylla</italic> Standl., used in Mesoamerican traditional medicine for treating sleep disorders. This effect seems to be related to the capacity of 
 <italic>V. prionophylla</italic> to increase pentobarbital-induced sleep time and to decrease sleep latency [
