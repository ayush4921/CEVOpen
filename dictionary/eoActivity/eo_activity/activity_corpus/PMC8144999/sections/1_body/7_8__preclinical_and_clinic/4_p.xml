<p>Several authors reported that the administration of valepotriates or 
 <italic>V. officinalis</italic> root extracts in zebrafish larvae induced the modulation of c-fos and of Npas4a, involved in regulating of the neural circuits [

 <xref rid="B163-plants-10-00846" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>]. The modulation of these genes, induced by valepotriates, together with their ability to bind GABA
 <sub>A</sub> receptors and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors confirm the neuroprotective effects of valerian extracts [

 <italic>V. officinalis</italic> can protect the neurons of the hippocampus from ischemic damage and restore behavioral deterioration. These protective effects are due to the ability of 
 <italic>V. officinalis</italic> and its main constituents such as valerenic acid and acetylvalerenolic acid, to inhibit the activity of the nuclear factor (NF)-ÎºB in vitro [

 <italic>V. officinalis, V. jatamansi,</italic> and 
 <italic>N. jatamansi</italic> can certainly also attributed to the inhibitory activity exerted on AChE [
