<p>Some compounds are also studied for their anticonvulsant, antidepressant, and stress-reducing properties. Monoterpenoids from 
 <italic>V. glechomifolia</italic> and sesquiterpenoids from 
 <italic>V. fauriei</italic> showed antidepressant activity in mice [

 <xref rid="B41-plants-10-00846" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Valerena-4,7(11)-diene from 
 <italic>N. jatamansi</italic> reduced stress in animal studies [

 <italic>V. jatamansi</italic> and valtrates from 
 <italic>V. laurifolia</italic> showed anticonvulsant properties in mice [

Interestingly, several compounds from subfamily Valerianaceae were more associated with a certain biological effect in the central nervous system. Sesquiterpenoids such as kanshone, kissoone, nardosinone, valerinic acid, etc., were shown to have anti-neuroinflammatory properties and sedative effects. Flavonoids such as linarin and methylapigenin were known to have sedative effects. On the other hand, monoterpenoids and glycosides were shown to have neuroprotective properties against oxidative stress and toxicants in neural cell lines. These compounds have huge potential to be developed as preventive and therapeutic interventions for different diseases of the CNS. Most of the studies for these compounds are still currently in the preclinical phase and warrant more clinical studies in the future.
