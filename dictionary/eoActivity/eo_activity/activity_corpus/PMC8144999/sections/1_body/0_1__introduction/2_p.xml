<p>The calyx can be completely lacking as in some 
 <italic>Valeriana</italic> species, reduced to small teeth as in 
 <italic>Fedia</italic> and 
 <italic>Valerianella</italic>, leafy and persistent as in 
 <italic>Nardostachys</italic>, or pappus-like and featherly as in some 
 <italic>Valeriana</italic> species and in 
 <italic>Centranthus</italic>. The genera of this sub-family include 
 <italic>Valeriana</italic> L., 
 <italic>Centranthus</italic> Lam. and DC., 
 <italic>Fedia</italic> Gaertn., 
 <italic>Patrinia</italic> Juss., 
 <italic>Nardostachys</italic> DC., 
 <italic>Plectritis</italic> (Lindl.) DC., and 
 <italic>Valerianella</italic> Mill. Phytochemical studies revealed the presence of sesquiterpenes, valepotriates, alkaloids, flavonoids, organic acids, and their derivatives, as characteristic classes of constituents in Valerianaceae plants [

 <xref rid="B4-plants-10-00846" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-plants-10-00846" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It is generally accepted that valepotriates are common in Valerianaceae species and are responsible for their sedative properties. The present review is designed to report the current knowledge on the plant species that belong to the sub-family Valerianaceae, their phytochemicals, and their uses in the treatment of several diseases with particular emphasis to the action on the central nervous system (CNS). All collected data have been obtained from different databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Sci Finder, Web of Science, Science Direct, NCBI, and Google Scholar.
