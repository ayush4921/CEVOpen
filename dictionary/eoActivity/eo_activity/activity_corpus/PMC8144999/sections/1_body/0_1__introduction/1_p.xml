<p>Valerianaceae, the sub-family of the family Caprifoliaceae (order Dipsacales), contains about 315 species of annual and perennial herbs, distributed, throughout the world, except Australia and New Zealand, usually at high elevations. Achene fruits, absence of endosperm, bilaterally symmetric or sporadically asymmetric and sympetalous flowers, three-carpellate and inferior ovaries, one fertile carpel at maturity, and an anatropous ovule are the main characteristics of Valerianaceae sub-family species [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-10-00846" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Valerianaceae sub-family showed significant diversity in flowers and fruits morphology. Probably, the most remarkable variation in the morphology of flowers is related to the stamens number ranging from 4 to 1. Donoghue et al. [
 <xref rid="B2-plants-10-00846" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] described a reduction from the ancestral condition of 4 to 3 stamens in the Valerianaceae core, followed by an additional reduction to two stamens in
