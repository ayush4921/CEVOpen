<p>For the extraction process of biologically active compounds from plants under the sub-family Valerianaceae, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00846-f002">Figure 2</xref> shows the schematic diagram. The roots and the rhizomes were usually air-dried at room temperature. Some of the air-dried samples were further macerated and pulverized for greater absorption of the solvent. Air-dried plant samples were extracted with ethanol, methanol, hexane, and water solvent and underwent solvent partitioning with a range of nonpolar to polar solvents such as ether, ethyl acetate, and butanol. Most authors initially extracted the pulverized sample using an alcohol solvent such as ethanol or methanol because these are the most polar among the non-polar solvents and can extract several compounds [

This is because the compounds extracted have different polarity and solubility and through this range of solvents can a researcher identify the most active compound. The most common compound isolated belongs to the group of terpenoids. Most terpenoids are non-polar and volatile, thus, solvent partitioning involving this range of non-polar to polar solvents is important to isolate and purify the potent compound [
