<p>To ensure the reliability and replicability of preclinical studies using compounds from plants under the sub-family Valerianaceae, standardization of plant collection and identification; phytochemical compounds extraction, isolation and validation are warranted. Generally, plants undergo several processes before a pure compound can be isolated. This includes collection and authentication of the plant, extraction, purification, and structure determination. All the studies that were reviewed in this manuscript have utilized the roots and the rhizomes of the plant as the main source for the crude extract and the isolation of its potent pure compound. Extraction, fractionation, and purification of the roots and rhizomes of Valerianaceae have no difference as compared to other plant extraction. Each roots and rhizomes undergo air-drying, soaking, and chromatographic fractionation and purification. This is a general method in all natural products research to extract all the possible compounds within the plant. The roots and rhizomes are typically used for medicinal purposes because it is believed that the essential oils from its roots produce the biologic activity [
