<p>Each crude extract underwent a purification process through different chromatographic techniques such as the use of silica gel column chromatography, thin-layer chromatography (TLC), and preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). TLC is commonly done among natural products research. It is the simplest and cheapest technique to separate several components in an extract and verify the identity and purity of the compound. Furthermore, TLC serves as a guide in setting the parameters for column chromatography as a means for preparative separation [

Meanwhile, column chromatography is widely used as an initial separation step for the phytochemical components because of its simplicity, high capacity, and low cost. In column chromatography, the mobile phase carries the bioactive components as they pass through the stationary phase that separates the components depending on their affinity [

In isolating iridoids, it was noted that these three common techniques of purification: preparative TLC, silica gel CC, and preparative HPLC were used. It is a traditional way and more feasible way to isolate compounds before undergoing more advance chromatographic techniques.
