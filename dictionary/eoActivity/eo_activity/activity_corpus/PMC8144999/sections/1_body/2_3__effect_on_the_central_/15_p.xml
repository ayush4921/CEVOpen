 <italic>Nardostachys jatamansi</italic> (D. Don) DC. (synonymous

 <xref rid="B74-plants-10-00846" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] using a rat model of chronic fatigue syndrome, observed a significant reversion of the locomotor activity and the anxiety state in stressed animals, after the oral administration of the extract (200 and 500 mg/kg b.w.). The extract showed the capacity to manage lipid peroxidation, nitrite, superoxide dismutase, and catalase activities indicating that the antioxidant properties of this extract can be responsible for its anti-stress effects. Later, Lyle et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-plants-10-00846" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] used a cold restraint stress model to investigate the biochemical and neurochemical alterations induced by oral administration of a hydro-ethanolic extract in the same doses and observed alterations on rats enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant system, and alleviated oxidative stress and neurochemical alterations induced by cold restraint stress.
