 <italic>V. officinalis</italic> root extract was intraperitoneally administered to rats and the number of entries and time spent on the open arms of an elevated plus-maze was evaluated. A reduced anxious behavior was observed in extract-treated rats in comparison to the control group and valerenic acid was suggested as the main anxiolytic component in the extract.
