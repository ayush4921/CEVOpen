 <italic>V. jatamansi</italic> (synonymous 
 <italic>V. wallichii</italic> DC.), popularly named as Indian valerian, is considered as an Asian counterpart for the European 
 <italic>V. officinalis</italic>, is another important medicinal plant from the genus 
 <italic>Valeriana,</italic> broadly recognized for its uses in anxiety, insomnia, epilepsy, and hysteria treatment (Nadkarni, 2001). Many studies are reporting the pharmacological properties of this species including the sedative, tranquilizing and neuroprotective effect, and its capacity to attenuate stress, anxiety, and depression (

The anti-anxiety effect of its ethanol extract was studied on empty bottle-stimulated rats using the open field and the elevated plus-maze tests. Four bioactive compounds (hesperidin, isochlorogenic acid A, isochlorogenic acid B, and isochlorogenic acid C) were identified as the chemical markers for that effect [
