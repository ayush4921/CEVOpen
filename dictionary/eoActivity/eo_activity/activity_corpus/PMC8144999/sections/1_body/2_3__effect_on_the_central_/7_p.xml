<p>The neuroprotective properties of 
 <italic>V. officinalis</italic> extract and its therapeutic potential for neurological disorders have been reported. The extract showed protective effects against toxicity induced by rotenone in 
 <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> [
 <xref rid="B66-plants-10-00846" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Rotenone is a chemical substance widely used as a pesticide that acts within the respiratory chain causing oxidative damage. Animalsâ€™ treatment with this substance has been used as a model to study brain disorders linked with redox imbalance. Amaral de Brito et al. [
 <xref rid="B56-plants-10-00846" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] recently observed that 
 <italic>V. officinalis</italic> extract has protective effects against in vitro cytotoxicity induced by rotenone in rat glioma C6 cells, by a novel action on the cortical spreading depression.
