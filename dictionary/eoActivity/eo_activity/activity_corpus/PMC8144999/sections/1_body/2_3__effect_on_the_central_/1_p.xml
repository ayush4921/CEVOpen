<p>Among Valerianaceae plants, species from the genus 
 <italic>Valeriana</italic> (e.g., 
 <italic>V. officinalis</italic> L., 
 <italic>V. jatamansi</italic> Jones, 
 <italic>V. fauriei</italic> Briq., 
 <italic>V. amurensis</italic> Smir. ex Kom, 
 <italic>V. glechomifolia</italic> Meyer, 
 <italic>V. polystachya</italic> Smith, etc.) are the most used to treat CNS-related disorders (

 <italic>V. officinalis</italic> is the most used particularly for its sedative, anticonvulsant, tranquilizing, and anxiolytic properties. According to the European Medicine Agency, extracts from this species roots can be used to alleviate mild nervous anxiety and sleep disorders [

 <italic>V. officinalis</italic> is available as an herbal supplement and is extensively utilized to cure anxiety disorders. Its anxiolytic effects have been studied by different authors using different models. Hattesohl et al. [
 <xref rid="B21-plants-10-00846" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] investigated in vivo the myorelaxant, anxiolytic, sedative, and antidepressant properties of different extracts from this species. None of the studied extracts showed myorelaxant or sedative activity up to limit doses of 500 or 1000 mg/kg b.w. Nevertheless, some extracts showed pronounced anxiolytic activity in the elevated plus-maze assay and one extract, after subacute treatment, showed anti-depressant activity in the forced swimming assay, allowing to conclude that the anti-depressant and anxiolytic effects may contribute to the positive effects of valerian to improve sleep quality.
