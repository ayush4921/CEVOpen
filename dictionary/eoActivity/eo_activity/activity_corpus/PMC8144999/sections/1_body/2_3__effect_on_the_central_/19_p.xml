<p>Many investigations have been performed in animals to assess the anticonvulsant properties of 
 <italic>N. chinensis</italic>. An ethanol extract significantly increased the seizure threshold in a dose and time-dependent manner in a rats’ model of electric shock-induced seizures [

 <italic>N. jatamansi</italic> extract (400 mg/kg b.w.) in a maximal electric shock model was less than that of the standard sodium valproate (300 mg/kg b.w.) [
 <xref rid="B81-plants-10-00846" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. The neuroprotective effect of an ethanol extract from the roots of this species against Aβ toxicity was studied in vitro using a cell culture system and in vivo using a 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> AD model [
 <xref rid="B82-plants-10-00846" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] and the results suggest that the neuroprotective effect observed can be linked with the extract antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and its inhibitory effect against extracellular-signal-regulated kinase signaling. Indeed, several extracts, fractions, and compounds from this species exhibited anti-neuro inflammatory by different mechanisms [
