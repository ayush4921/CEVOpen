<p>This species has been traditionally used as a tranquilizer and sedative agent and many investigations demonstrating its anxiolytic and sedative properties. The sedative effect of extracts and isolated compounds applied by inhalation were previously reported [

 <xref rid="B75-plants-10-00846" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,
 <xref rid="B76-plants-10-00846" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Takemoto et al. [
 <xref rid="B76-plants-10-00846" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] investigated the sedative effects of oxygenated compounds applied by inhalation in an excitatory mouse model treated with caffeine and showed that aristolen-1(10)-en-9-ol exerted its effects via the GABAergic system. The anxiolytic effects of 
 <italic>N. jatamansi</italic> extract were investigated after oral administration to mice (250 mg/kg) by using different behavioral tests, such as elevated plus maze, light-dark box test, open field test, and Vogelâ€™s conflict test [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-10-00846" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. A 7 days treatment with the extract showed significant anxiolytic effects and increased levels of brain monoamine and GABA neurotransmitter, suggesting that anxiolytic effects are mediated by activating the GABAergic receptor complex.
