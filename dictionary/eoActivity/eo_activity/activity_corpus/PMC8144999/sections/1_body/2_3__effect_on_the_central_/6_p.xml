<p>Yoo et al. [
 <xref rid="B52-plants-10-00846" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] investigated the neuroprotective action from 
 <italic>V. officinalis</italic> root extracts in gerbils after transient cerebral ischemia. The results revealed that the oral pretreatment with 100 mg/kg of extract decreased microglial activation and lipid peroxidation protection against ischemic damage in the hippocampal pyramidal neurons. In another study, the same root extract (100 mg/kg) and valerenic acid (340 Î¼g/kg) was orally administered to control mice and aged mice (previously treated with D-galactose) to evaluate their effects on cell proliferation, memory function, and neuroblast differentiation in the mouse dentate gyrus [
 <xref rid="B49-plants-10-00846" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Both enhanced the preferential exploration of new objects (novel object recognition test) and the escape latency, platform crossings, swimming speeds, and spatial preference for the target quadrant (Morris water maze test). They also improved cognitive function, promoted cell proliferation, neuroblast differentiation, and decreased the plasma corticosterone levels in aged mice.
