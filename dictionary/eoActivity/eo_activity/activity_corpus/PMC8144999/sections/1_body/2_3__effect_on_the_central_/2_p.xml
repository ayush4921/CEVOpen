 <xref rid="B22-plants-10-00846" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Obtained data suggested that this extract could suppress stress responses through the modulation of the changes in the turnover of norepinephrine and serotonin in the amygdala and hippocampus, and through the control of corticosterone plasma levels.
