<p>Valepotriates from

 <sub>v</sub>2.2 and Ca
 <sub>v</sub>3.1 calcium channels in a selective way which is coherent with the analgesic action of this species in relieving gastrointestinal and rheumatic pain [

 <xref rid="B98-plants-10-00846" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>] indicated that its use for alleviating abdominal distention and pain may be mediated through Ca
 <sub>v</sub>2.2 channel. Although the information about the anticonvulsant effects of valerian is scarce, studies from Rezvani et al. [
 <xref rid="B63-plants-10-00846" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] suggested that it is mediated through the activation of the adenosine system.
