 <xref rid="B88-plants-10-00846" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. A recent study of molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation suggests that valerian compounds could be valuable resources for the development of GABA-transaminase inhibitors [

 <xref rid="B89-plants-10-00846" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>] suggested an interaction with glutamatergic receptors as a possible mechanism by which valerian exhibit its action in the central nervous system. Valerian compounds like valerenic acid and valerenol also displayed allosteric modulation of GABA receptors [

 <sub>1</sub> receptor and GABA
 <sub>A</sub> receptors separately contribute to the valerian capacity to induce sleep [
