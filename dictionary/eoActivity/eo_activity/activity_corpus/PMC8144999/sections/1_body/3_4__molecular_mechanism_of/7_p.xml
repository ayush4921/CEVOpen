<p>The anti-neuroinflammatory effects of 
 <italic>N. jatamansi</italic> extracts and isolated compounds have been described by different authors. Ko et al. [
 <xref rid="B83-plants-10-00846" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>] reported that four nardosinone-type sesquiterpenes showed anti-neuroinflammatory action on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced immortalized murine brain microglia BV2 cell lines by inhibiting NF-κB- and MAPK-mediated inflammatory pathways. The anti-neuroinflammatory effects of two sesquiterpenoids from this species, desoxo-narchinol A and narchinol B, in BV2 and the primary microglial cell, was also reported, which is related to the inhibition of LPS-induced expression of iNOS and COX-2 enzymes the suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1b, IL-6, and TNF-a). Yoon et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-plants-10-00846" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] showed that the inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway was also implicated in the anti-neuroinflammatory effect of three sesquiterpenoids from this species. Recently, Kim et al. [
 <xref rid="B84-plants-10-00846" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>] reported the anti-neuroinflammatory effect of desoxo-narchinol A and narchinol B in microglial cells by up-regulating of nuclear transcription factor erythroid-2-related factor 2/heme oxygenase-1 signaling. The mechanisms of action of Valerianaceae plants have not been fully investigated in humans. The effects of 
 <italic>V. officinalis</italic> extract on cortical excitability were evaluated in humans with transcranial magnetic stimulation [
 <xref rid="B100-plants-10-00846" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>] and it was observed that a single oral dose adjusts intracortical facilitatory circuits.
