<p>Santos et al. [
 <xref rid="B54-plants-10-00846" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] demonstrated that different compounds from 
 <italic>V. officinalis</italic> extract may trigger distinct mechanisms involved in neuronal cell protection in PD. Hesperidin, and probably linarin, alleviate oxidative stress effects during ATP depletion due to its capability to binding SUR1. On the other hand, valerenic acid and apigenin avoid cortical hyperexcitation by stimulating neuronal cells from the substantia nigra to release GABA on the brain stem. 
 <italic>V. amurensis</italic> showed protective effects on amyloid-beta (Aβ)-induced toxicity in PC12 cells [
