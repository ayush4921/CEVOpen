<p>Recently Li et al. [
 <xref rid="B47-plants-10-00846" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] demonstrated that the antidepressant activity of the iridoid-rich fraction from 
 <italic>V. jatamansi</italic> in a chronic unpredictable mild stress mouse model is exerted by regulating several metabolic pathways such as the synthesis of neurotransmitters, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and amino acid metabolism. Recent studies also using the same model indicated that that gut flora structures and regulation of serotonin, norepinephrine, substance P, and corticotropin-releasing factor in the brain and intestine, can be implicated in the antidepressant properties of this plant [
