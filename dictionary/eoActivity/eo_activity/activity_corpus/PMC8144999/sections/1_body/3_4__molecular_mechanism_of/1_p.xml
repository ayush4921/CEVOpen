 <italic>V. officinalis</italic> extracts are one of the most popular herbal medications used to alleviate insomnia, anxiety, epilepsy, and other conditions of the CNS. Several studies have been conducted to clarify the mechanisms implicated in the pharmacological effects of these extracts. γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS. GABA is crucial for normal brain function and a reduction in its concentration has been associated with several neurological conditions as is the case of epilepsy, AD, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, etc. If GABA balance is perturbed, conditions like depression, sedation, anxiety, restlessness, and insomnia may also arise [

Due to the blood–brain barrier, GABA cannot be easily introduced into the CNS, thus the inhibition of GABA aminotransferase, the enzyme responsible for its degradation, has been the target for the adjustment of GABA amounts in the CNS. The mode of action of valerian compounds is associated with the modulation of GABAergic transmission via inhibition of GABA transaminase, interaction with GABA receptor/benzodiazepine, and intervention in uptake and intake of GABA in synaptosomes.
