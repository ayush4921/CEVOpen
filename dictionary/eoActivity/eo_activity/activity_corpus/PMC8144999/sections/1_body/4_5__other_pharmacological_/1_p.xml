<p>As aforementioned some Valerianaceae species, particularly from the 
 <italic>Valeriana</italic> genus, are well investigated for their pharmacological potential on the central nervous, namely anxiolytic, antidepressive, antinociceptive, and anticonvulsant, etc. However, various 
 <italic>Valeriana</italic> species are still understudied for other biological properties. Among all the species, 
 <italic>V. officinalis</italic>, 
 <italic>V. jatamansi</italic> (syn. 
 <italic>Valeriana wallichii</italic>), 
 <italic>V. hardwickii</italic> Wall, and 
 <italic>V. stenoptera</italic> Diels. are the ones that show better potential for further investigation in drug discovery. The bioactivity of root extracts from 
 <italic>V. officinalis</italic> is mainly associated with its anxiolytic compounds, as the valerenic acid and its biosynthetic precursors, valerenal and valerenadiene. Î²-Caryophyllene is another sesquiterpenoid present in the extracts but is more associated with the anti-inflammatory effect, and in this case, 
 <italic>V. officinalis</italic> and 
 <italic>V. wallichii</italic> still need to be more deeply studied. Regarding anti-viral, hepatoprotective, or immune stimulant activities, no relevant data was found in the last ten years. The most recent research with 
 <italic>Valeriana</italic> spp. is published in anti-anxiety, anti-bacterial, anti-cancer, anti-depressive, and cardiovascular effects, and they are summarized below for a better understanding of the data available.
