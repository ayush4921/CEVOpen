<p>Cravotto, et al. [
 <xref rid="B109-plants-10-00846" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>] summarized the available scientific information on the intense, in-progress investigation for novel plants, extracts, and compounds with intense anti-inflammatory activity and found out that 
 <italic>V. officinalis</italic> has, among many others understudy, this potential too. Other species like 
 <italic>V. jatamansi</italic> Jones also presented this bioactivity [

 <italic>V. wallichii</italic> leaves (topical formulation cream) using an in vitro and in vivo screening. The authors presented data of a considerable in vitro anti-inflammatory activity obtained with the ethyl acetate fraction [
