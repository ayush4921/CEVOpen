<p>According to a report, lowering of blood pressure and heart rate, antiarrhythmic, regulation of blood lipid levels, and anti-myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury are bioeffects that can be attributed to 
 <italic>Valeriana</italic> spp. them. The vasorelaxant effect in endothelium-denuded rings was obtained with a hexane extract from 
 <italic>V. edulis.</italic> The authors speculate that this effect could be related to the presence of valepotriates obtained from the hexane extract rhizomes [

 <xref rid="B114-plants-10-00846" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>] that some plant extracts, compared with the “model group”, could decrease the percentage of infarct volume, improve neurological activity, accentuate the expression of 
 <italic>VEGFR2</italic> and number of new blood vessels in the cortex infarction around, given a possible further use to relive the acute cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury [
