<p>Another antioxidant activity investigation carried out with the aerial parts and roots of 
 <italic>V. jatamansi</italic>, collected in pre-flowering, flowering, and post-flowering phenological stages, pointed to higher results for the first one, which could be correlated to the maximum concentration of phenolics and flavonoids. These methanolic extracts include catechin, and various phenolic acids as gallic, chlorogenic, hydroxybenzoic, caffeic, and 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric, which largely varied among the different phenological stages, and along the altitudes. It was also highlighted that the pre-flowering stage is the most suitable for harvesting the roots containing the maximum phytochemicals amounts and antioxidant activity even for the samples which have few phenolics as the ones collected at high altitudes [
