<p>In natural products, different compounds are under screening for their antioxidant activity and the possible use for therapeutic strategies, for instance in degenerative diseases. Among the various therapeutic properties attributed to 
 <italic>Valeriana</italic> spp., most of them correlated to valepotriates, the antioxidant properties were also investigated. According to Sudati et al. [
 <xref rid="B111-plants-10-00846" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>], 
 <italic>V. officinalis</italic> extracts show a protective effect on lipid peroxidation (LPO) caused by different pro-oxidant reactive with neuro damage relevance. Dugaheh et al., [
 <xref rid="B112-plants-10-00846" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>] also studied the antioxidant effect of root extracts from 
 <italic>V. officinalis, N. jatamansi,</italic> and 
 <italic>V. sisymbriifolia</italic>. The best DPPH inhibition effect was obtained with 
 <italic>V. officinalis</italic> extracts, but all of the tested plants inhibited beta-carotene oxidation.
