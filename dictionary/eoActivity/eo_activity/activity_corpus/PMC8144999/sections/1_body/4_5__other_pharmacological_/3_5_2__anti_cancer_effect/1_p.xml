<p>Current pharmacotherapy has critical tools to speed the development of new target therapies which will accelerate the final goal in the fight against cancer. Various compounds separated from 
 <italic>V. jatamansi</italic> and 
 <italic>V. officinalis</italic> roots were active for a variety of cellular cancer lines, both in vitro and in vivo assays. For instance, among the isolated constituents from 
 <italic>V. jatamansi</italic>, the derivative IVHD-valtrate, is one of the most promising molecules that was tested against human ovarian cancer cells (A2780 and OVCAR-3), in vitro and in vivo. This compound showed inhibition of the growth and proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner. This compound also revealed low cytotoxicity to immortalized non-tumorigenic human ovarian surface epithelial cells (IOSE-144), which is very important for further research. The authors even refer that Preclinical results pointed out 
 <italic>IVHD-valtrate</italic> as a potential therapeutic drug for this type of cancer [
