<p>The studies reported and discussed in the present review article have indicated the multifaceted biological activities of many species from the Valerianaceae sub-family. Reviewed studies indicated that species from the genus 
 <italic>Valeriana</italic>, particularly species like 
 <italic>V. officinalis</italic>, 
 <italic>V. jatamansi, V. fauriei, V. amurensis, V. glechomifolia,</italic> and 
 <italic>V. polystachya</italic> have positive effects to treat disorders related to the Central Nervous System dysfunctions, such as insomnia, anxiety, and epilepsy. The mode of action of valerian compounds is mainly associated with the modulation of GABAergic transmission. Nevertheless, validated clinical studies are still necessary to establish the numerous and interesting biological activities associated with the pharmacological applications of the species.
