 <italic>in vitro</italic> antibacterial activity of napin and cruciferin rapseed proteins to confirm their antimicrobial potential. They found that both the SSPs, napin and cruciferin, can act as a potent candidates to develop new antimicrobial agents as well as can be used in complementary medicine to alleviate diseases.
