Authors summarized the data on cathelicidins including its chemistry, characterization, pharmacological action especially antimicrobial and antibioflim effects as well as their mechanism of action. They also highlighted the potentials cathelicidins for the development of novel antibiotics to defend antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
