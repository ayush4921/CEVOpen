<p>After homogenization of the contents, the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h for the bacterial strains. MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazoliumbromide) was used as an indicator of viability of microorganisms in each well and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Wells, where microbial growth was inhibited, remained colorless after incubation with MTT while those with bacterial growth turned blue.</p>
