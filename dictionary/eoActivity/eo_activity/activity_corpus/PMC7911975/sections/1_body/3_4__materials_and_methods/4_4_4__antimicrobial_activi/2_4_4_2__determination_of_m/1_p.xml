<p>The MIC is the lowest concentration in extract inhibiting any visible growth of microorganisms. It was determined by the microdilution method used by Felhi et al. [
 <xref rid="B63-plants-10-00205" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Serial and semiserial dilutions were prepared to obtain a concentration range. Thus, 90 μL of MH broth for the bacteria were dispersed in each well by adding 10 μL of each inoculum already prepared. Of each dilution of the PCEO 100 μL was thus poured. The last well, containing the MH for bacteria without addition of the oil, was considered as a positive growth control. In addition, another well, containing DMSO without PCEO, was used as a negative control. The final volume in each well was equal to 200 μL.
