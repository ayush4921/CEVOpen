<p>As for the fungal strains, the growth was carried out at 30 °C on Sabouraud agar until the mycelial growth covered the whole box. From these dishes, a spore suspension was obtained in 10 mL water containing sterile tween. Similarly, the optical density was adjusted to 0.08–0.10 in order to obtain a solution equivalent to 10
 <sup>6</sup> spores/mL.
