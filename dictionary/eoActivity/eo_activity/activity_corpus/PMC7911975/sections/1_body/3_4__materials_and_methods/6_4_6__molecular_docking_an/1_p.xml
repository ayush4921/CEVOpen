<p>Interactions between natural compound and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase were assessed by in silico molecular docking in order to explore the preferred orientation of the ligands in the binding site of receptor. The crystal structures were obtained from the Protein Data Bank: 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (PDB code 1JIJ). All water molecules have been removed and the co-crystallized ligand from the structures. Polar hydrogens and Gasteiger charges were assigned with AutoDockTools1.5.2 (ADT) and the PDBQT file format was prepared [
 <xref rid="B65-plants-10-00205" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. ADT was used to select a docking grid. In 1JIJ, the grid box site was established in −10.908, 14.432 and 86.420 Å (x, y and z). The grid box size for the coordinates x, y and z was 25 Å, with a grid spacing of 0.375 Å.
