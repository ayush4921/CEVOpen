 <xref rid="plants-10-00205-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> illustrates the average wound areas of the four groups and shows the percentages of average contraction of the wound surfaces at the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th and 13th days of the study. Delayed scarring was observed in control rats compared to all rats in the other groups. At day 13 in contrast to other groups, contraction of wounds in rats treated with PCEO was complete.
