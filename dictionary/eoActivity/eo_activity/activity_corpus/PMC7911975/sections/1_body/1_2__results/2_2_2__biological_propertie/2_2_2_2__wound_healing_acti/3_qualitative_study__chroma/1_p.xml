<p>Wound photographs of a rat representative of each group are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00205-f003">Figure 3</xref>. All wounds showed a similar appearance with bright red coloring. Nevertheless, this staining persisted even at the 5th postoperative day in untreated rats and bleeding occurred during the change of compresses that tended to adhere. Until the third day, the aspects of the wounds started to differentiate: the group treated with the PCEO showed a brown color as for the wounds of the reference lot, the control lot and the batch with the cream (without PCEO) presented a perilesional redness.
