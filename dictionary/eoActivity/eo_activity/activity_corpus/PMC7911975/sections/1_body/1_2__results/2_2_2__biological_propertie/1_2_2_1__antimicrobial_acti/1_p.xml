<p>Due to the increased severity of diseases caused by microbial pathogens, essential oils and their major chemical constituents are potential candidates as antimicrobial agents. According to their inhibition zone diameter (IZD), minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) values, the tested essential oil exhibited different degrees of antimicrobial activity against a panel of pathogenic microorganisms using the agar diffusion method. Depending on the susceptibility of the tested bacteria (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00205-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), PCEO exhibited IZD values ranging from 13.0 ± 0.8 to 23.0 ± 0.8 mm with 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> (19.0 ± 0.5 vs. 12.0 ± 2.0 mm) was found to be the most sensitive whereas 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> (15.0 ± 0.6 vs. 26.0±1.0 mm) was found to be the most resistant strains. Additionally, in the case of Gram-positive bacteria, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (19.5 ± 1.0 mm) possesses noteworthy value (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) as compared to the positive control, chloramphenicol (16.5 ± 0.5 mm). Additionally, PCEO inhibited moderately the growth of the others bacteria.
