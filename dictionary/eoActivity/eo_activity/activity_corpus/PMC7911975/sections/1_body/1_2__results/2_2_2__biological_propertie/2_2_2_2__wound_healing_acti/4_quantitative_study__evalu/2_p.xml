<p>This study aimed to evaluate the healing effect of PCEO in a rat model compared to a reference product, “Cicaflora
 <sup>®</sup>”. Topical application of the tested PCEO appeared to accelerate wound healing and contraction of the skin margins compared to controls. A healing effect was observed with PCEO significantly better than the reference. It allowed complete healing after 13 days.
