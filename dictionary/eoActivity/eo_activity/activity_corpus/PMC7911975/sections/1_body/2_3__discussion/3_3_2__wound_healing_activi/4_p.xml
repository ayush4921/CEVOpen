 <xref rid="B44-plants-10-00205" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] suggest that antioxidants prevent cell damage, promote DNA synthesis, increase vascularity and improve the strength of collagen fibers. Their effects related to the individual or the additive effect of different phytoconstituents associated with the antimicrobial activity of the oil that contributes synergistically to the healing process [
