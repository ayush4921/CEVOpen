<p>The process of healing was carried out by immunological activities of the victim itself generating various risk factors such as infection and week immunity delay in healing has brought attention to promote this process [

The body weights behavior of the rats during the experimental period indicate clearly that all groups were uniform suggesting that PCEO had no side effects on the rats. Topical application of the oil appears to accelerate wound healing and contraction of the skin banks compared to controls. The phytochemical profile revealed that PCEO contains a considerable phenylpropanoids, especially in methyeugenol and eugenol that present an important role in the inflammatory cascade (prostaglandins, thromboxanes and leukotrienes). These substances act as mediators of inflammation and accelerate the inflammatory process [
 <xref rid="B35-plants-10-00205" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Thus, they increase local neovascularization, remodeling of the extracellular matrix, fibroblastic cell migration and differentiation, which accelerates the healing wounds [

This phase is characterized by the formation of granulation tissue that involves angiogenesis, migration of fibroblasts and collagen synthesis [
 <xref rid="B37-plants-10-00205" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Morphological examination of wounds showed a more elaborate granulation tissue in the groups treated with the PCEO and the reference healing, which is composed of capillary neovessels and fibroblastic elements that elaborate the collagen and mononuclear cells. After 7 days, an increased inflammatory swelling was noted in all control wounds. This pronounced inflammatory reaction noted in this group, even at late stages of the experiment indicates a prolonged inflammatory behavior [
 <xref rid="B38-plants-10-00205" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The latter predisposes to a higher risk of superinfection of the wound and delayed healing. In contrast, the wounds of rats treated with the oil showed faster healing dynamics with total contraction after 13 days of treatment. The granulation tissue thus formed was the bed of a rapid re-epithelialization observed with the oil and the reference-healing wound resulting in a total closure of the wound.
