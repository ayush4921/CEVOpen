<p>The analyses and identification following NMR spectroscopy of the 
 <italic>Tagetes lucida</italic> essential oil revealed the presence of geranyl acetate ((
 <italic>E</italic>)-3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadien-1-ol acetate) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-00675-f001">Figure 1</xref>; see also 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-00675">Supplementary Materials</xref>) as the major compound (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-00675-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), representing 50% of the total content. The NMR spectrum of this essential oil showed almost exclusively the diagnostic signals for the monoterpene (
 <bold>1</bold>): δ
 <sub>H</sub> 5.34 [1H, t, 
 <italic>J</italic> = 8 Hz, H-2; δ
 <sub>C</sub> 118.2 (C-2)], and δ
 <sub>H</sub> 5.07 [1H, t, 
 <italic>J</italic> = 8 Hz, H-6; δ
 <sub>C</sub> 123.7 (C-6)] signals for two vinyl protons; an allylic methylene group at δ
 <sub>H</sub> 4.59 [2H, d, 
 <italic>J</italic> = 8 Hz, H-1; δ
 <sub>C</sub> 61.37 (C-1)]; two methylene groups at δ
 <sub>H</sub> 2.09 and 1.72 assigned to C-5 (δ
 <sub>C</sub> 39.5) and C-4 (δ
 <sub>C</sub> 26.26). At 2.04 ppm, a singlet (3H) was assigned to the methyl of an acetoxy group (δ
 <sub>C</sub> 171.0 and 21.2); three other singlets (3H each) at δ
 <sub>H</sub> 1.69, 1.67, and 1.59 were assigned to C-10, C-8, and C-9 methyl groups (δ
 <sub>C</sub> 16.4, 25.6 and 17.6), and two quaternary vinyl signals were recorded at δ
 <sub>C</sub> 142.2 (C-3) and δ
 <sub>C</sub> 131.8 (C-7). Its identity was confirmed based on spectral data (NMR and MS) and by comparison with reported values in the literature (AIST: Integrated Spectral Database System of Organic Compounds [
