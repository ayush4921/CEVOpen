<p>As observed in the temporal course curves, administration of the antagonists per se did not modify nociceptive responses in both phases of the formalin test, since behavioral nociception was observed similar to that in the vehicle group. In contrast, a differential significant effect of β-caryophyllene alone or combined with the antagonists was obtained (
