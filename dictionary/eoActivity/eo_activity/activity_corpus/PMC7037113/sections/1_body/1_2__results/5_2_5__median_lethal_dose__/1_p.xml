<p>The LD
 <sub>50</sub> was calculated as 316 mg/kg, i.p. in mice. This dosage produced mortality in 50% of mice treated with the 
 <italic>T. lucida</italic> essential oil. Animals receiving 100 or 1000 mg/kg, i.p. showed a reduced ambulatory activity that was recovered after 10 and 25 min of the treatment administration, respectively. Twenty-four hours after treatment, mice administrated with 1000 mg/kg died (100% mortality), whereas those receiving 100 mg/kg showed 0% mortality. Mice surviving gained weight and did not show pathological changes in the macroscopic examination after euthanasia subsequent to the observation for 14 days.
