<p>The analyses and identification following NMR spectroscopy of the 
 <italic>Tagetes lucida</italic> essential oil revealed the presence of 22 compounds, representing 100% of the total content of volatiles, with 69.18% monoterpenes, 29.10% sesquiterpenes, and 1.71% non-identified compounds. The qualitative composition of volatile compounds in aerial parts was determined by GC/MS analysis (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-00675-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-00675-f001">Figure 1</xref>; see also 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-00675">Supplementary Materials</xref>), listed in order of their elution together with their retention times. The major volatile compounds were geranyl acetate (
 <bold>1</bold>, 49.89%), geraniol (
 <bold>2</bold>, 7.92%), β-caryophyllene (
 <bold>3</bold>, 6.27%), (−)-β-cubebene (
 <bold>4</bold>, 7.72%), and 
 <italic>cis</italic>-β-ocimene (
 <bold>5</bold>, 5.60%). It is worth mentioning that compound 
 <bold>2</bold> could be obtained via an elimination reaction of the acetoxy group from geranyl acetate using the temperature conditions in the chromatograph. In part, this could explain its lower percentage determined by GC versus the quantity determined by NMR.
