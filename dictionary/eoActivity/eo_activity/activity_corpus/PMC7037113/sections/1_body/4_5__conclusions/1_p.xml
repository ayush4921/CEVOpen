<p>In conclusion, the NMR and GC/MS methods allowed the analysis of 
 <italic>T. lucida</italic> essential oil to demonstrate the presence of geranyl acetate as the major compound, followed by geraniol and Î²-caryophyllene, where the latter was confirmed as a participant bioactive metabolite in the antinociceptive activity of this 
 <italic>Tagetes</italic> species. Pharmacological in vivo data gave evidence not only of the antinociceptive effects of this plant but also its safety as analgesic, since it did not produce gastric damage, unlike clinic drugs, suggesting its potential for pain therapy.
