 <italic>Writhing test</italic>. Abdominal nociception was induced by an i.p. injection of 1% acetic acid; this test is characterized by abdominal contractions known as writhes, described as an exaggerated extension of the abdomen combined with the outstretching of hind limbs [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-25-00675" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The essential oil (0.1, 1.0, and 10 mg/kg, i.p.), β-caryophyllene (3.16 and 10 mg/kg, i.p.), and metamizole (reference drug, 80 mg/kg, i.p.) were evaluated in this test. Immediately after acetic acid administration, the number of writhes was recorded for 1 min every 5 min during 30 min. Data expressed as temporal course curves were utilized to observe changes in the maximal number of writhes induced in mice. A dose–response graph was plotted using the area under the curve (AUC) to determine the significant antinociceptive dose of the essential oil or β-caryophyllene (see timeline in
