<p>The method estimated the dose of the essential oil that would kill 50% of the animal population via an intraperitoneal route of administration (i.p.). Mice were treated with a maximal dosage of 2000 mg/kg, i.p. according to the indication of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (2001). If 100% of the treated mice died, doses of 1000 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg were then tested. Mice surviving were kept under observation for the following 14 days, and their weights were registered; at the end of the study, a macroscopic evaluation was done. The median lethal dose was calculated according to the report of Lorke [
