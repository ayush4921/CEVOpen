<p>To describe nociceptive behavior (dose–response) in the writhing and formalin tests, the temporal course curves of nociception were calculated as the area under the curve (AUC) using the trapezoidal rule. Data are expressed as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) of at least six repetitions. Temporal course curves were analyzed by two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. Dose–response data were examined by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s test or Tukey´s test using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software INC, La Jolla, CA, USA), version 8.0. A
