<p>Analyses by GC/MS were carried out in an Agilent 7890 A series gas chromatograph (Agilent Technology, Palo Alto, CA, USA) coupled with a JEOL JMS-GC Mate II mass spectrometer (JEOL USA, Peabody, MA, USA). Compounds were separated on an Agilent Technology DB-5MS (30 m × 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 μm) capillary column, using the following GC oven temperature program: 1 min at 40 °C, followed by 8 °C/min up to 300 °C, held for 6 min. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The electronic ionization energy was 70 eV, and the mass range scanned was 1–600 uma. Scan rate was 1 spec/s. Transfer line and ionization chamber temperatures were 300 °C. Data acquisition and processing were performed with TSS pro 3.0 software system (Shrader Analytical and Consulting Laboratories, Detroit, MI, USA); mass spectra were compared with the National Institute of Standards and Technology-2 (NIST-2) data base. The components were identified based on the comparison of the relative retention indices calculated using a series of 
 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes (C-8–C-20) and the mass spectra from the spectrometer database (NIST library), followed by comparison with published data.
