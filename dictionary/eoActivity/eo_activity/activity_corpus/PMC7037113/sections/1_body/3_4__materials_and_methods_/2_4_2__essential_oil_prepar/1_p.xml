<p>The essential oil from aerial parts of 
 <italic>Tagetes lucida</italic> was prepared by steam distillation for three hours using air-dried and ground aerial parts (749 g of plant material and 9.0 L of distilled water) using a modified Clevenger-type apparatus. From this procedure, 2 mL of the pure essential oil was obtained (yield 0.26%), which was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and stored in an amber bottle at −4 °C until further analysis.
