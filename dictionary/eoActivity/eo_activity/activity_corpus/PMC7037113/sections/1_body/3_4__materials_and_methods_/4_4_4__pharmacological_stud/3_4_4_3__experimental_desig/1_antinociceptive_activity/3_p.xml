 <italic>Formalin test</italic>. After a habituation of 20 min, rats were administered with the essential oil (3.16, 10, and 31.62 mg/kg, i.p.), β-caryophyllene (3.16, 5.62, and 10 mg/kg, i.p.), or the reference drug indomethacin (20 mg/kg, i.p.). Thirty minutes later, chemical nociception was induced as follows: immediately after 50 µL injection in the sub plantar area of the right hind paw with 1% formalin by using a 30-gauge needle, each rat was placed into a glass cylinder provided with mirrors to enable a total panorama of the nociceptive behavior [

Two periods of high shaking activity were considered. The first one was present immediately after injection and lasted 5 min; this is known as the early phase (neurogenic phase). A second period was observed 5–30 min after formalin injection, denominated the late phase (inflammatory phase). Control animals received the vehicle with the same route and time of administration (see timeline in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-00675-f007">Figure 7</xref>B). The temporal course curves and dose–response graphs were plotted. The area under the curve (AUC: shaking per min) was calculated to determine the significant antinociceptive dose of the essential oil and β-caryophyllene.
