<p>Regarding the pharmacological evaluation of the antinociceptive effects of 
 <italic>T. lucida</italic> essential oil, it is not yet reported, nor is it reported for other 
 <italic>Tagetes</italic> species. Nevertheless, the anti-inflammatory properties were preliminary reported in in vitro studies using 
 <italic>T. minuta</italic> and 
 <italic>T. lucida</italic> essential oils from Iran [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-25-00675" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and Colombia [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-00675" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], respectively. The essential oil composition from 
 <italic>T. minuta</italic> from the Iran region demonstrated dihydrotagetone (33.86%), (
 <italic>E</italic>)-ocimene (19.92%), tagetone (16.15%), 
 <italic>cis</italic>-β-ocimene (7.94%), (
 <italic>Z</italic>)-ocimene (5.27%), limonene (3.1%), and epoxyocimene (2.03%). In a similar manner, this species from foothills of northern India was represented by (
 <italic>E</italic>)-ocimenone (31.8–42.2%), (
 <italic>Z</italic>)-β-ocimene (22.9–32.7%), (
 <italic>Z</italic>)-tagetone (8.0–11.0%), (
 <italic>Z</italic>)-ocimenone (6.0–10.3%), dihydrotagetone (1.7–3.7%), (
 <italic>E</italic>)-tagetone (1.0–2.5%), and limonene (1.0–1.5%) [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-00675" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In those pharmacological studies, mechanisms of action were determined through measuring NADH oxidase, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and TNF-α mRNA expression in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated murine macrophages using real-time PCR [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-25-00675" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] or by determination of nitric oxide, prostaglandin (PGE2) production, or TNF-α concentration [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-00675" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], where 
 <italic>T. minuta</italic> and 
 <italic>T. lucida</italic> oils showed significant anti-inflammatory activity.
