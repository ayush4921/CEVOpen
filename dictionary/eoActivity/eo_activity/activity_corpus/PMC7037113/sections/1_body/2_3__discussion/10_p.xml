<p>Another interesting and important metabolite in the 
 <italic>T. lucida</italic> essential oil is β-caryophyllene, which is considered a potent selective agonist of the cannabinoid receptor subtype 2 (CB2). Its antinociceptive activity in a neuropathic pain model in mice reported not only the involvement of CB2 receptors in the central nervous system (CNS) but also inhibition of p38 MAPK/NF-κB activation, as well as reducing cytokine release [

 <xref rid="B33-molecules-25-00675" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In addition, it was reported as a significant inhibitor of the inflammatory phase of formalin using oral administration [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-00675" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In our study, it was observed that opioid and benzodiazepine receptors are also involved in the antinociceptive mechanism of action of this terpene, mainly at a central level. On the other hand, in addition to these receptors, the 5-HT
 <sub>1A</sub> serotonin receptor and nitric oxide showed partial participation in both phases of the formalin test in rats. Traditional healers recommend 
 <italic>T. lucida</italic> aerial parts, not only in hot baths but also orally consumed as an infusion or hydroalcoholic extract. In a preliminary study, we explored a polar extract and the identified flavonoids and coumarins as antinociceptive compounds of this species [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-00675" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In addition, our present data complement the potential of this medicinal species by exploring the essential oil and a bioactive metabolite, as well as likely constituents in the hot preparations of this plants. Altogether, these constituents and others might be acting in a synergistic manner to support the potential analgesic-like effect of 
 <italic>T. lucida</italic> preparations in traditional medicine for alleviating pain.
