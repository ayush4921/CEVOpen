<p>Aromatic properties of 
 <italic>Tagetes</italic> depend on the presence of essential oils. In the case of 
 <italic>T. lucida</italic> Cav., the phytochemical studies of its essential oil were already reported after gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis. It is important to mention that the presence of methyl chavicol (estragole) was observed as a major constituent among other volatile compounds in 
 <italic>T. lucida</italic> species, such as those cultivated in Guatemala (33.9%) [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-00675" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], Costa Rica (95â€“97% aerial parts) [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-25-00675" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], Italia (93.8% leaf and 78.2% flowers) [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-00675" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], Cuba (96.8%) [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-00675" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], Colombia (92.1%) [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-00675" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and Egypt (90%) [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-25-00675" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, this compound was not found in the 
 <italic>T. lucida</italic> oil extracted from a species from Mexican regions, as corroborated in this study. The low or very low presence of methyl chavicol (&lt;11.7%) agrees with other groups exploring this species [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-00675" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].
