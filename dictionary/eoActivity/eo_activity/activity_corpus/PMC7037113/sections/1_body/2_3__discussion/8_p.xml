<p>In our study, 
 <italic>T. lucida</italic> essential oil produced a significant and dose-dependent pharmacological antinociceptive response in the nociceptive experimental pain model. The most abundant constituents found in this species were geranyl acetate, followed by the presence of geraniol and β-caryophyllene; minor abundance was found for (−)-β-cubebene, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-β-ocimene, γ-elemene, linalool, and β-pinene, as well as traces of others.
