<p>Essential oils are natural products of aromatic plants traditionally used all over the world for thousands of years. Their effectiveness is recommended by healers and shamans throughout history in all cultures [

The combination of all ingredients can produce the final activity of an essential oil. Nevertheless, one extracted component may be an important element in the efficacy of the entire extract of a plant [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-25-00675" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In fact, extracting one component will generally not work effectively without the other trace elements to provide balance. Thus, the quality of the essential oil depends on the constituents to produce efficacy in the treatment. The chemical composition is represented by mono and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and their oxygenated derivatives, along with aliphatic aldehydes, alcohols, and esters.
