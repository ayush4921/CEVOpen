  <italic>Tagetes lucida</italic> Cav. (Asteraceae) is an ancient medicinal plant commonly used to alleviate pain. Nevertheless, scientific studies validating this property are lacking in the literature. Animal models of pain were used to evaluate the antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities of 
  <italic>T. lucida</italic> essential oil (TLEO) and a bioactive metabolite. The chemical constitution and possible toxicity of the extract and the mechanism of action of β-caryophyllene were also explored. Temporal course curves and dose–response graphics were generated using TLEO (0.1–10 mg/kg or 3.16–31.62 mg/kg) and β-caryophyllene (3.16–10 mg/kg). Metamizole (80 mg/kg) and indomethacin (20 mg/kg) were used as reference drugs in the formalin assay and writhing test in rats and mice, respectively. The β-caryophyllene mechanism of action was explored in the presence of naloxone (1 mg/kg), flumazenil (10 mg/kg), WAY100635 (0.16 mg/kg), or nitro-
  <sc>l</sc>-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (20 mg/kg) in the formalin test in rats. GC/MS analysis demonstrated the presence of geranyl acetate (49.89%), geraniol (7.92%), and β-caryophyllene (6.27%). Significant and dose-dependent antinociceptive response was produced by TLEO and β-caryophyllene without the presence of gastric damage. In conclusion, β-caryophyllene was confirmed as a bioactive compound in the 
  <italic>T. lucida</italic> analgesic properties by involving the participation of receptors like opioids, benzodiazepines, and Serotonin 1A receptor (5-HT
  <sub>1A</sub>), as well as nitric oxide.
