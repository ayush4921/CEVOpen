<p>For the assessment of caspase activation, MCF-7 cells were treated with 250-1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL of AG-ME. The activities of caspase-3 and caspase-9 were measured by using caspase colorimetric assay kits according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol (BioVision Inc., USA). The changes in caspase-3 and caspase-9 activities were determined by comparing the results with untreated control sets.
