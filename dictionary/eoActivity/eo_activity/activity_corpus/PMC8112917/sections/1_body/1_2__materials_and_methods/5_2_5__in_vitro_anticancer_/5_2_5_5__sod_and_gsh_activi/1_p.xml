<p>Role of oxidative stress in the cell death induced by AG-ME was assessed using commercially purchased kits (Cayman Chemicals) for glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) assays. Briefly, MCF-7 cells were seeded in 6-well culture plates and incubated for overnight. After exposing the cells at 250-1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml of AG-ME, the cells were harvested and homogenate was prepared by sonication. Following the centrifugation, the supernatant of the control and exposed cells were collected and assay was done as per the protocol given with kits.
