<p>The anticancer potential AG-ME was examined against MCF-7, A-549, and HeLa cells using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiozol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide salt, MTT assay [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The dried extract (AG-ME) was firstly dissolved in DMSO then diluted in a cell culture medium to reach the final concentrations of 10-1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml. The final concentration of the DMSO solvent used for cytotoxicity assessments was not more than 0.04% in culture medium. In brief, MCF-7, A-549, and HeLa cells were allowed to grow in 96-well plates (1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well) for overnight. The cells were then exposed to 10-1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml concentrations of AG-ME for 24 h. After incubation, 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>l MTT solution (5 mg/ml) was added in wells and incubated for 4 h. The developed formazan crystals were dissolved in 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>l DMSO, and absorbance was read at 550 nm.
