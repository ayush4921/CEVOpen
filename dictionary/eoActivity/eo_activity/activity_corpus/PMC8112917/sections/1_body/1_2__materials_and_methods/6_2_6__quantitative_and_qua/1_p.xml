<p>For measuring the quantitative and qualitative ROS generation, MCF-7 cells were treated with 250-1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml of AG-ME. Subsequently, cells were incubated in DCF-DA fluorescent dye for 1 h in dark. Then, the fluorescence strength of qualitative DCF-DA probe was visualized under a fluorescence microscope and quantitative intensity of the fluorescence was obtained by using a fluorescence microplate reader at 485 and 528 nm excitation and emission, respectively.
