<p>The ferric reducing capacity, which imitate AG-ME antioxidant efficacy, was estimated by Fe
 <sup>+3</sup> to Fe
 <sup>+2</sup> method [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In brief, 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of each concentrations of AG-ME was mixed with 2.5 ml of 0.2 M of sodium phosphate buffer and potassium ferricyanide solution (1% 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>). Then, the solution was mixed by vertex and incubated for 20 min at 50°C. Further, 2.5 ml of trichloroacetic acid (10% 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) was added in the mixer. After centrifugation at 3000 rpm, a supernatant (2.5 ml) was added with equal volume of deionized water and 0.5 ml ferric chloride (0.1% 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>). The developed color was read at 700 nm.
