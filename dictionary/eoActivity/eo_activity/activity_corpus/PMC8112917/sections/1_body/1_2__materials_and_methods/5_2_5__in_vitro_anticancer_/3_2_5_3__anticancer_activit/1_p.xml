<p>The anticancer efficacy of AG-ME was also assessed by NRU assay using the method as described previously [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Briefly, MCF-7, A-549, and HeLa cells were plated in a 96-well and were allowed to grow overnight. Afterwards, cells were treated to 10-1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml AG-ME for 24 h. Following treatment, the cell culture medium was aspirated and replaced with medium containing 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml neutral red dye. Following 3 h incubation, the dye was extracted using destaining solution (50% ethanol, 49% water, and 1% acetic acid) and the plate was read at 550 nm.
