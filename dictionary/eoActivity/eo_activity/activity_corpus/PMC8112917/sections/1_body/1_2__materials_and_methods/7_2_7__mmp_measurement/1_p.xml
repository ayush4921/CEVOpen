<p>Loss of MMP in MCF-7 cells exposed to AG-ME was evaluated by using the Rh-123 fluorescent dye. In brief, MCF-7 cells were exposed to AG-ME at 250-1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml for 24 h. Then, cells were incubated with Rh-123 dye (10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml). Afterwards, fluorescence intensity was observed as previously described [
