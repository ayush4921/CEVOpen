<p>The 
 <italic>A. graveolens</italic> seeds were screened manually. Seeds were ground to a coarse powder. About 500 g of grounded seeds were soaked in 1.5-liter methanol for 7 days with regular agitation. The extract was filtered using Whatman #1 filter paper and funnel. The filtrate was then concentrated to dryness in a rotary evaporator at 40°C under reduced pressure. The obtained methanolic extract of 
 <italic>A. graveolens</italic> seeds, named as AG-ME, was stored at 4°C for further use.
