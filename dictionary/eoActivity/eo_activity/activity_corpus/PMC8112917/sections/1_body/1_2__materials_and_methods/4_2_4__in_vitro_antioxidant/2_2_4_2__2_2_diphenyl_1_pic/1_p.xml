<p>The DPPH scavenging activity of AG-ME was performed using [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] method with slight modifications. Briefly, 0.3 mM of DPPH solution was prepared in alcohol and extract concentrations in DMSO. Then, designated well of 96-well plate was filled with 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of each concentrations of extracts and 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of DPPH solution. Following 30 min incubation, absorbance of the plate was read at 515 nm. Ascorbic acid was used as the standard. The % radical scavenging activity was determined by the formula: 100 − (sample reaction O.D./control reaction O.D.) × 100.
