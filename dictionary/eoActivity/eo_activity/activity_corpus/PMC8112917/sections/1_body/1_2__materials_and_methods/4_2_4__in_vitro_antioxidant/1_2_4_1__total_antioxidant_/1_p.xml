<p>The total antioxidant power of AG-ME was measured using the phosphomolybdate assay following the method reported [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In brief, 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of seed extracts (50-1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) was added to 3 ml of reaction mixture (0.6 M sulphuric acid, 28 mM sodium phosphate, and 1% ammonium molybdate). The mixer was then incubated at 95°C for 10 min to complete the reaction. After cooling, the reaction mixer was read at 695 nm. The percent antioxidant power was calculated by the formula: [(
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> − 
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>1</sub>)/
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>] × 100, where 
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> is the control O.D. and 
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> is the extract O.D.
