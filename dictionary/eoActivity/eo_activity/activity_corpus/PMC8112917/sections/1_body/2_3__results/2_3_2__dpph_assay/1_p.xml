<p>DPPH results of AG-ME are given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(b)</xref>. The scavenging efficacy of DPPH radical was observed in a concentration-dependent way. The percent inhibition was found to be 25.45%, 41.82%, 55.40%, 70.56%, and 81.16% at 50, 100, 250, 500, and 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, respectively, for AG-ME. The percent DPPH radical inhibition by ascorbic acid was observed as 30.56%, 52.36%, 64.37%, 84.63%, and 95.40% at 50, 100, 250, 500, and 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, respectively. The AG-ME exhibited lower scavenging activity than ascorbic acid (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(b)</xref>). The IC
 <sub>50</sub> of AG-ME was 225 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, while ascorbic acid was 95
