<p>The results of total antioxidant efficacy of 
 <italic>A. graveolens</italic> seed extract (AG-ME) at different concentrations are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(a)</xref>. Since, the phosphomolybdate method is quantitative; therefore, the total AG-ME antioxidant power is presented corresponding to ascorbic acid. AG-ME showed a concentration-dependent antioxidant activity at 50-1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml. At 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, the antioxidant efficacy of AG-ME was 15.1%, while at 250, 500, and 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, the antioxidant capacity of AG-ME was 36.3%, 58.6%, and 85.6%, respectively. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> value (344.3 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) of AG-ME showed considerable antioxidant capacity compared to ascorbic acid (247.0 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) (
