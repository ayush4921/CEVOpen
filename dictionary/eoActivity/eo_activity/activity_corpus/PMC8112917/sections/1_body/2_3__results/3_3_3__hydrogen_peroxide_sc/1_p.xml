<p>The results of scavenging potential of AG-ME on hydrogen peroxide are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(a)</xref>. As shown in the figure, a concentration-dependent (50-1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) strong hydrogen peroxide scavenging activity of AG-ME was observed. At the concentration of 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> scavenging activity of AG-ME was 78.65%; however, at the same concentration, ascorbic acid was 82.43%. The H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> scavenging activity of AG-ME closely resembled to the ascorbic acid. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> of AG-ME and ascorbic acid were 126.3 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml and 100.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, respectively (
