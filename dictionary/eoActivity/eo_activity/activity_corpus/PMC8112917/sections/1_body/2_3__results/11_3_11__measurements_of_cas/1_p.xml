<p>In order to assess the involvement of caspases in AG-ME-induced MCF-7 cell death, the activities of caspase-3 and caspase-9 enzymes were investigated. As given in Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7(c)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7(d)</xref>, the AG-ME exposure caused caspase-3 and caspase-9 activation in a concentration-dependent manner (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). The results showed that MCF-7 cells exposed to AG-ME increased the caspase-3 activity by 1.3-, 1.7-, and 2.1-fold (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7(c)</xref>) and caspase-9 activity 1.2-, 1.6-, and 1.9-fold (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7(d)</xref>) at 250, 500, and 1000â€‰mg/mL, respectively.
