<p>DCF-DA dye was used to evaluate whether AG-ME could induce ROS generation in MCF-7 cells. The fluorescence microscopic images of qualitative ROS production and quantitative analysis have positively indicated that the treatment of AG-ME at 250, 500, and 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL significantly increases the cellular ROS production with the increasing doses of AG-ME (Figures
