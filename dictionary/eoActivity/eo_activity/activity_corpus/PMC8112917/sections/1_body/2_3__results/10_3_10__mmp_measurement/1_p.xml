<p>To examine the decrease of MMP induced by AG-ME, the MCF-7 cells were treated at various concentrations of AG-ME. The decrease of MMP is one of the early biochemical markers of apoptosis progression. To determine the depletion in MMP level, we used Rh-123 dye which indicates potential-dependent accretion in the mitochondria. As depicted in Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7(a)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7(b)</xref>, a significant dose-dependent decline of MMP occurred in MCF-7 cells exposed to AG-ME. The results exhibited a 14%, 32%, and 49% of loss in MMP at 250, 500, and 1000
