<p>The changes in cellular morphology of MCF-7, A-549, and HeLa cells are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. As shown in the figure, obvious morphological changes were observed at 24 h treatment with AG-ME at 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml. Compared to untreated control, the MCF-7, A-549, and HeLa cells exposed to AG-ME at 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml lost their original shape, become less in number, rounded, and shrunken with apoptotic bodies (
