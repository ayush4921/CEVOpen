<p>To study the oxidative stress-mediated cytotoxicity of AG-ME in MCF-7 cells, SOD and GSH activities were measured by exposing the cells with various concentrations of AG-ME (250, 500, and 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) for 24 h. MCF-7 cells treated with AG-ME exhibited a concentration-dependent increase in SOD and a reduction in GSH activities. The reduction in the GSH activity was observed as 14%, 39%, and 60% at 250, 500, and 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, respectively, (

 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL of AG-ME showed an increase of 10%, 28%, and 42%, respectively, in SOD activity (
