<p>MTT assay was conducted to assess the anticancer effects of AG-ME at different concentrations on MCF-7, A-549, and HeLa cell lines. As observed by MTT assay and depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the AG-ME decreased the MCF-7, A-549, and HeLa cell viability in a concentration-dependent way. The MCF-7 cell viability was found to be 10%, 19%, 31%, 48%, 69%, and 81% at 1000, 500, 250, 100, 50, and 25 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml of AG-ME, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(a)</xref>). The A-549 cell viability was found to be 21%, 30%, 46%, 59%, 75%, and 89% at 1000, 500, 250, 100, 50, and 25 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml of AG-ME, respectively, (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(b)</xref>); however, in HeLa cells, the viability was recorded as 29%, 42%, 55%, 68%, 80%, and 95% at 1000, 500, 250, 100, 50, and 25 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml of AG-ME, respectively, (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(c)</xref>). The cell viability of MCF-7 was decreased by AG-ME even at lower concentrations, i.e., 25 and 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml. The MCF-7 cells were shown to be more sensitive towards AG-ME followed by A-549 and HeLa cells. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values obtained for MCF-7, A-549, and HeLa cells were 104 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, 122 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, and 156 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, respectively by MTT assay (
