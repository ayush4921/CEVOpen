<p>This is a colorimetric method which is based on the reduction of ferric complex to ferrous colored form in the existence of antioxidant. The results of this assay are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(b)</xref>. As shown in the figure, a concentration-dependent increase in the reducing power of AG-ME and ascorbic acid was observed. The increased absorbance of the reaction solution indicates the increased reducing power of extract and standard. The maximum absorbance of the AG-ME was 1.387, compared to 2.231 for ascorbic acid at 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml. At the dosage of 50-1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml of AG-ME, ascorbic acid showed reducing values of 0.143-0.997 and 0.231-1.534, respectively (
