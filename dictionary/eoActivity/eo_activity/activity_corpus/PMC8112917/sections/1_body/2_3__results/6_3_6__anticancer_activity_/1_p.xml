<p>The anticancer efficacy of increasing concentrations of AG-ME on MCF-7, A-549, and HeLa cells was also evaluated by NRU assay. The results are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. As shown in the figure, the percent viability of MCF-7 cells was recorded as 14%, 23%, 36%, 54%, 75%, and 85% at 1000, 500, 250, 100, 50, and 25 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml of AG-ME, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(a)</xref>). The viability of A-549 cells was decreased from 89% to 21% between 25 and 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml of AG-ME (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(b)</xref>); however, the viability of HeLa cells was decreased from 95% to 29% between 25 and 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml of AG-ME (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(c)</xref>). Similar to MTT assay, MCF-7 cells were more sensitive towards AG-ME followed by A-549 and HeLa cells by NRU assay. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values by NRU assay were 109 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, 250 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, and 312 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml for MCF-7, A-549, and HeLa cells, respectively (
