<p>The involvement of oxidative stress (OS) in neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, ageing, and cancer is well documented [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Natural antioxidants from plant materials may provide protection against OS by inhibiting free radicals [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Therefore, in this study, the antioxidant and anticancer efficacies of 
 <italic>A. graveolens</italic>, a known ayurvedic medicine used in traditional medicine system, were studied. The antioxidant activity is a composite process generally happening via various mechanisms and is affected by many other reasons that cannot be completely distinct by a single method. Therefore, it is necessary to measure by more than one type of assays, to take into elucidation of different mechanisms of antioxidant efficacies [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>–
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Taking into account, in this study, four corresponding assays were performed to assess the antioxidant efficacies of AG-ME. Total antioxidant, DPPH, H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> scavenging, and ferrous reducing antioxidative capacity assays were achieved. The methods used in this study have different mechanism of reaction. Total antioxidant efficacy and DPPH assays are based on both single-electron transfer that produced violet solution [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and hydrogen atom transfer reaction [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. OH
 <sup>−</sup> is one of the most reactive free radicals; thus, it is required to deliberate the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> scavenging activity of natural antioxidants. It can be generated by Fenton reaction between H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and ferrous ion [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. However, the mechanism of ferrous reducing antioxidative capacity is based on electron transfer [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. All these assays significantly revealed the antioxidant and antiradical potential of AG-ME. Our results showed that the AG-ME possess significant total antioxidant capacity corresponding to 85.6% as compared to ascorbic acid (98.6%) at highest concentration, i.e., 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml. These data suggest the potential equivalent antioxidant ingredients of AG-ME since ascorbic acid is used as a reference standard to compare the potential antioxidant efficacy of AG-ME [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. With increasing concentrations of AG-ME, there was an increase also found in DPPH activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 225 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml. This indicates an increased ability of AG-ME to donate hydrogen ions ensuing in a brighter solution, which is relative to the number of gained electrons [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Thus, it may be suggested that AG-ME has potential DPPH activity by reducing the radicals to equivalent hydrazine as a result of its hydrogen ion donating ability. These results are in agreement with [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], who has reported that 
 <italic>A. graveolens</italic> showed radical scavenging activity. The hydrogen peroxide scavenging capacity of AG-ME was also evaluated. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(a)</xref>, a dose dependent radical scavenging potential of AG-ME was examined with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 126.3 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml compared to ascorbic acid (100.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml). The abnormal gathering of hydrogen peroxide is accountable for OS which are associated with many chronic diseases [
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Consequently, regulation of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> production by plant antioxidants is of high interest in biological research [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The ferrous reducing antioxidative capacity measures the reducing capacity of an antioxidant and its properties that are related to presence of compounds which exert their action by breaking free radical chain via donating a hydrogen atom [
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(b)</xref>, the absorbance of AG-ME was increased with the increasing concentrations because of formation of Fe
 <sup>++</sup> complex, as it was also observed in ascorbic acid. As observed in this investigation, the ferrous reducing activity of AG-ME might be due to the hydrogen donating by AG-ME, which is accountable for its reducing capacity [
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. All these antioxidant assays clearly exhibited strong antioxidant activities, but slightly lesser than standard ascorbic acid. These results are accordance to other reports exhibiting antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>A. graveolens</italic> essential oil and extracts because of the existence of the hydroxyl group, which are liable for antioxidant efficacies [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We have further evaluated the anticancer efficacies of AG-ME against MCF-7, A-549, and HeLa cell lines. The findings of MTT and NRU assays clearly showed that AG-ME significantly inhibited MCF-7, A-549, and HeLa cell viability with the increasing doses. There are various methods available for measuring the cytotoxicity of materials under 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> condition [
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In this study, we used 3-(4,5-dimethylthiozol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide salt assay (MTT) and neutral red uptake (NRU) assays, since they are well-known and widely used methods for cytotoxic/antiproliferative efficacies of plant extracts. These assays are based on colorimetric measurements of viable cells after incubation with test materials. The MTT assay measures the functional state of mitochondria which indicate cell viability [
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], and NRU assay is based on incorporation of NR dye into lysosomes of viable cells [
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The AG-ME was found to inhibit MCF-7, A-549, and HeLa cells by 90%, 79%, and 81%, respectively, at 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml of AG-ME by MTT assay and 86%, 79%, and 71%, respectively, by NRU assay. The MCF-7 cells were found to be more sensitive towards AG-ME followed by A-459 and HeLa cells. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values obtained for MCF-7, A-549, and HeLa cells were 104 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, 122 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, and 156 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, respectively, by MTT assay and 109 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, 250 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, and 312 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, respectively, by NRU assay. The cytotoxic activity of AG-ME was also validated by changes observed in the cellular morphology. The MCF-7, A-549, and HeLa cells exposed to AG-ME at 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml lost their original shape, become less in number, rounded, and shrunken with apoptotic bodies. These results are corresponding to other reports which exhibited cytotoxic/inhibitory activities of 
 <italic>A. graveolens</italic> essential oil on MCF-7, HeLa, and Caco-2 cell lines with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 67 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, 93 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, and 216 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, respectively, as measured by MTT assay [
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In another study, it has also been demonstrated that the essential oil of 
 <italic>A. graveolens</italic> revealed a dose-dependent anticancer/antiproliferative activity against human hepatocellular carcinoma cells with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 59.6 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The methanolic extract of 
 <italic>A. graveolens</italic> has also been reported to exhibit cytotoxic/anticancer activities against mouse leukemia L1210 cells [
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Further to explore the mechanism(s) of cytotoxicity induced by AG-ME, we have selected most sensitive cell line, MCF-7. Herein, we explored the effects of AG-ME on the GSH and SOD activities in MCF-7 cells treated with 250-1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml of AG-ME for 24 h. GSH and SOD are known to play a significant role in maintaining cellular redox balance or oxidative stress through its antioxidant mechanism. Our results showed that the GSH activity was decreased and SOD activity was increased with the increasing concentrations of AG-ME. These results are accordance to the previously published reports suggesting that the exposure of plant extracts could decrease the GSH [
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] and increase the SOD activities [
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] in MCF-7 (human breast carcinoma). The lowering of GSH activity and an increase in SOD activity indicated that oxidative stress is involved in MCF-7 cell death-induced by AG-ME. Oxidative stress tempted by the accumulation of ROS increases the sensitivity of cancer cells and is capable of inducing apoptotic cell death [
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Based on the results obtained by DCF-DA assay, AG-ME was found to increase ROS production in MCF-7 cells, suggested that AG-ME induced oxidative stress by ROS generation. Excessive ROS generation is known to cause damage to cellular DNA, lipids, proteins, and biomembranes which leads to cell death [
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Studies showed that excessive ROS generation can facilitate mitochondrial permeabilization [
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The decrease of MMP level is one of the early biochemical markers of apoptosis progression. The findings of the study also displayed that AG-ME significantly decreased MMP level in MCF-7 cells. These findings provided a strong evidence towards the role of ROS mediated loss of MMP in MCF-7 cell death. To further elucidate the pathways of cell death induced by AG-ME, caspase-3 and caspase-9 enzyme activities were evaluated. Caspase-3 is one of the caspases involved in the final implementation of dying cells whereas caspase-9 is an initiator involved in the intrinsic pathway [
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Thus, to understand the mechanisms of action induced by AG-ME, caspase-3 and caspase-9 enzyme activities were measured. The results exhibited that AG-ME induced a dose-dependent increase in caspase-3 and caspase-9 activities in MCF-7 cells. These results suggest that the AG-ME-induced MCF-7 cell death is caspase-dependent. The caspase-dependent anticancer activity of plant extract has also been previously reported in MCF-7 [
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. A large number of phytoconstituents present in methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>A. graveolens</italic> have already been reported [
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]; therefore, we assume that the anticancer efficacies of AG-ME observed in present investigation might be due to the existence of phytocompounds in it. Herein, the reported results also supported the relationship of cytotoxicity with antioxidant activities. Consequently, the antioxidant activities of AG-ME might contribute to its cytotoxicity/anticancer activities.
