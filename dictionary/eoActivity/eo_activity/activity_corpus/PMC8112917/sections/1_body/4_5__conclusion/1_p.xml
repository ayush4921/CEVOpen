<p>The present study provided a reasoning and reassurance for the uses of 
 <italic>A. graveolens</italic> for medical purposes. The methanolic extract of 
 <italic>A. graveolens</italic> (AG-ME) showed significant antioxidant efficacies as observed by total antioxidant, DPPH radical scavenging, H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, and ferrous reducing capacities. As it can be seen from this investigation, 
 <italic>A. graveolens</italic> may be used as a good supply of natural antioxidants through probable nutrition supplement. AG-ME also showed a dose-dependent strong anticancer/cytotoxic potential against MCF-7, A-549, and HeLa cell lines. It further exhibited oxidative stress-mediated ROS production and loss of MMP in MCF-7 cells. A dose-dependent increase in the activities of caspase-3 and caspase-9 suggests that the AG-ME-induced MCF-7 cell death is caspase-dependent. Additional investigation is required to examine biological and anticancer activities under 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> system to discover possible beneficial use of AG-ME against diseases.
