 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Hanif et al. (2019)</xref> results suggest that 
 <italic>Alcea rosea</italic> extracts cause bronchodilation through dual inhibition of phosphodiesterase enzyme and Ca2+ influx, which substantiate its potential in airways disorders. Flavonoids (Dihydrokaempferol-4′-O-β-d-glucopyranoside, dihydrokaempferol, kaempferol-3-O-[6″-(E-coumaroyl)]-β-d-glucopyranoside, kaempferol-3-O-β-d-glucopyranoside, Apigenin and kaempferol-3-O-α-l-rhamnopyranosyl-(1‴→6″)-β-d-glucopyranoside) were isolated from 
 <italic>Alcea rosea</italic> flowers, some showed potent cytotoxic activity against HepG-2 cell line 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, significant antioxidant activity or an immune stimulant activity (
