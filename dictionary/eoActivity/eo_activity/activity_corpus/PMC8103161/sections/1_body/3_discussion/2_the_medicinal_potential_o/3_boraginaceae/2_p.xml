<p>Pharmacological and preliminary clinical investigation on 
 <italic>Echium amoenum</italic> flower extracts focusing on nervous and degenerative disorders offer promising evidence for: obsessive-compulsive disorder (

 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">Rabbani et al., 2011</xref>). However it was experimentally evidenced that 
 <italic>Echium amoenum</italic> causes hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity in dose and time dependent effects (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Ghorbani et al., 2020</xref>). This advises against its prolonged consumption in monospecific teas, however its presence in mixtures would reduce the risk due to the decrease in the dose. A relatively low temperature of the water would improve aroma and other organoleptic properties of 
 <italic>Echium amoenum</italic> flower tea (
