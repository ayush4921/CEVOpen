<p>The essential oils from fresh and dried flowers and erial parts of lavender were analyzed by 
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">Smigielski et al. (2018)</xref>. Their main volatile components were linalool (26.5–34.7%), linalyl acetate (19.7–23.4%), β-ocimene (2.9–10.7%), and α-terpineol (2.8–5.1%). The lavender essential oils showed high activity against bacteria (

 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli, P. aeruginosa</italic>), yeast and filamentous fungi (
 <italic>Candida</italic> sp., 
 <italic>A. niger</italic>, 
 <italic>P. expansum</italic>), inhibiting their growth at concentrations ranging from 0.4 to 4.5 μg/ml. The highest antioxidant activity was exhibited by the essential oil from fresh erial parts (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 77.11 mg/ml) while the oil from dried flower displayed the weakest activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 22.1 mg/ml). However the use of lavender flowers in herbal teas is mainly based on dried flowers a weak antioxidant activity due to the essential oil should be expected.
