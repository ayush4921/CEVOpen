<p>The most valued and widely used part of 
 <italic>Hibiscus sabdariffa</italic> is the fleshy flower calyx, it is rich in citric acid (3.74% hence the sour taste imparted to the teas) pectin, anthocyanin pigments and vitamins. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies as well as some clinical trials provide some evidence for antibacterial, anti-oxidant, nephro- and hepato-protective, renal/diuretic effect, effects on lipid metabolism (anti-cholesterol), anti-diabetic and anti-hypertensive effects among others (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Da-Costa-Rocha et al., 2014</xref>). Phenolic acids (protocatechic acid and others), tricarboxylic acids (hydroxycitric acid), sulfoxides (hibiscus acid) and anthocyanins (delphinidin-3-sambubioside and cyanidin-3-sambubioside) are likely to contribute to the reported effects. 
 <italic>Hibiscus sabdariffa</italic> has an excellent safety and tolerability record (
