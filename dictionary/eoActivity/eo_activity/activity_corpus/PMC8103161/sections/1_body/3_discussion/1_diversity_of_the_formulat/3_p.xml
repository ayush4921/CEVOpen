<p>In the set of samples analyzed, the more traditional and less industrial ones present a markedly greater number of ingredients (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) that are slightly minced, therefore whole or in coarse fragments instead of crushed in powder, as usual in industrial tea bags. This implicates a random formulation of each single dose, where only predominant ingredients will be present with probability near 1 while others would rarely be present. This phenomenon was verified even in larger samples. From the “
 <italic>sarantha</italic>” formula bough in Naxos, we acquired two independent subsamples of c. 200 g in two consecutive days, both from the same bag of c. 5 kg, one was found to have 40 ingredients while the other only contained 38. This extreme diversity of single doses has a biological meaning that requires further investigation since simply attributing it to ignorance is not a sufficient and satisfactory explanation.
