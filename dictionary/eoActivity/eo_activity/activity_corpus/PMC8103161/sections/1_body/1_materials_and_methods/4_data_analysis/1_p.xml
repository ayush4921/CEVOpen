<p>In order to determine how different these 93 samples are, we took the 227 ingredients (201 species) as a reference. This led us to build a simplified presence/absence matrix reduced to 83 herbal tea samples and 10 spices mixtures (as outgroup) totalizing 93 individuals, and 201 species (variables). The crude matrix of presence/absence of species was used to compute a dissimilarity matrix using Darwin 6 V.6.0.9 (2015-04-15) (

 </disp-formula>Where d
 <sub>ij</sub> is the dissimilarity between samples i and j, a: number of variables where x
 <sub>i</sub> = presence and x
 <sub>j</sub> = presence, b: number of variables where x
 <sub>i</sub> = presence and x
 <sub>j</sub> = absence and c: number of variables where x
 <sub>i</sub> = absence and x
 <sub>j</sub> = absence. Dissimilarities are even and are Euclidean distances. The dissimilarity is = 0 for two samples sharing the 201 species and = 1 for two samples which present 0 species shared. This index concerns “presence/absence” data where only “presence” modality is informative, modality “absence” expressing mainly an absence of information. These two modalities are not symmetrical and their exchange leads to a completely different dissimilarity value. This index considers that a common absence for two units is uninformative to measure their dissimilarity (
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">Perrier and Jacquemoud-Collet, 2006</xref>). Therefore, similarity here reflects the number of coinciding species and dissimilarity is inversely proportional to this.
