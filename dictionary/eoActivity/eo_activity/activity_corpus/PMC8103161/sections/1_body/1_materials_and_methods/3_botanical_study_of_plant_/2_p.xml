<p>For the determination of Greek herbal mixtures, we have consulted keys and illustrations of different Greek floras (

 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Alibertis, 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Dimopoulos et al., 2020</xref>) and especially 
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">Papanikolau and Kokkini (1982)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Aneva et al. (2019)</xref> for 
 <italic>Sideritis</italic> species. We paid special attention to 
 <italic>Sideritis</italic> diversity and included in the study monospecific comparison samples, since 
 <italic>Sideritis</italic> are commercialized in the markets of Greece in form of entire plants in excellent state of conservation (
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s10">Supplementary Tables S1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s10">S2</xref>). We followed the methodology developed at our laboratory for the study of Section 
 <italic>Sideritis</italic> (
 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">Rivera et al., 1990</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">Obon and Rivera, 1994</xref>). Intra-population and inter-population genetic and morphological variability in 
 <italic>Sideritis</italic> species is high, something that is well visible in the species with the largest distribution area (
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">Papaporfyriou et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">Patelou et al., 2020</xref>). 
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Kalivas et al. (2014)</xref> proposed a molecular tool for taxonomic identification of 
 <italic>Sideritis</italic>, however, only 
 <italic>S. perfoliata</italic> and 
 <italic>S. athoa</italic> differed from the rest with a high level of support. Nevertheless morphometric data, i.e., length of the acumen in the bracts, trichome types, allow to distinguish the different 
 <italic>Sideritis</italic> taxa of the Balkans and Eastern Mediterranean (

 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">Sahin et al., 2008</xref>;
