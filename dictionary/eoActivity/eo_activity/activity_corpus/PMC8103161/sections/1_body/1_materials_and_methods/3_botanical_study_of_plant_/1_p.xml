<p>In order to separate the ingredients within the mixtures, a nested column of sieves of decreasing diameter of 2, 1 and 0.37 mm, has been used. After sieving, the different components were separated using stainless steel pointed tweezers and a binocular microscope (Olympus; Model: VMT; Illumination source: TL2). Morphological characters of the ingredients were studied with two binocular microscopes: Olympus, SZ-PT (18x–110x) and Bausch and Lomb, StereoZoom, 4 (7x–30x) that are usually employed in plant taxonomic research and pharmacognosy work. The use of one or the other binocular was selected based on the detail of the characteristics to be analyzed. The former has been of considerable help in separating the smaller components and identifying others. The photography of the samples was carried out systematically. Depending on the date, different cameras were used: Fujifilm XQ2 equipped with Fujinon 4X f = 6.4–25.6 mm lens with a built-in flash, Canon EOS M100 equipped with Canon 15–15 mm lens. With image stabilizer and built-in flash and Nikkon D80 equipped with Micro Nikkor 60 mm 1:28 G ED lens. With Niddin digital MF 18 Macro ring flash.</p>
