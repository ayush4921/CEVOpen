<p>Some of the species that were identified in the mixture and are usually used globally, were verified following 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Bisset (1994)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr">Wichtl (1984)</xref>. Plant names and authors abbreviations were standardized consulting 
 <xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr">TPL (2020)</xref> as it was recommended by 
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">Rivera et al. (2014)</xref>. GRIN-Taxonomy (
 <xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr">Wiersema and Schori 2020</xref>) was consulted for cultivated plant species. In addition to information on scientific nomenclature, 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">IPNI (2020)</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">POWO (2020)</xref>, and 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">GBIF (2020)</xref> provided distribution maps and images.
