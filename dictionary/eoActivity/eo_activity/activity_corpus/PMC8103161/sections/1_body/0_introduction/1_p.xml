<p>Typical angiosperm flowers appeared more than 150 million years ago in the evolutionary history of plants, early in a pre-Cretaceous period, associated with pollinating insects that played a decisive role in the origin and early evolution of the angiosperms (
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">Ren, 1998</xref>). Most plant–pollinator relationships are considered to be mutually beneficial as plants derive reproductive benefits (pollen export and deposition, fertilization) in exchange for resources (nectar, pollen, oils) that directly or indirectly enhance the pollinator’s fitness (
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">Raguso, 2004</xref>). In this context, floral scent functions and visual cues attract pollinators, induce them to land, indicate a reward’s presence and location, and teach pollinators to associate the reward with specific flowers (

The chemicals that are involved in this ensemble of relationships stand available in the flowers in a wide repertory including: volatile compounds responsible of their scents (fatty acid derivatives, benzenoids, phenylpropanoids, isoprenoids, nitrogen containing compounds, etc.) (
