Recent clinical trial studies showed the potentiality of cannabis medicine in improving lower urinary tract dysfunctions such as overactive bladder, interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome, detrusor hyperreflexia, and urinary incontinence (Maniscalco et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2018</xref>, Nedumaran et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2010f</xref>). Hence, cannabinoids have great promising therapeutic potential for the treatment of various cancers (Kovalchuk and Kovalchuk 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2020</xref>); in particular, CBD has reported vigorous anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects on a wide variety of cancer types both in cultured cancer cell lines and in mouse tumor models. (Seltzer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">2020</xref>). Furthermore, traditional medicine practitioners in Zimbabwe used
