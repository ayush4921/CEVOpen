It is worth mentioning that in the USA, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has supported the use of Cannabis in the treatment of chronic pain in adults through their analysis of the current scientific evidence (Romero-Sandoval et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">2018</xref>), and a team of researchers also (Xiaoxue et al. 2019) found strong evidence that Cannabis with moderate high levels of THC can significantly alleviate pain. Cannabinoids may be useful in treating rheumatoid arthritis due to their anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activity (Lowin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2019</xref>, Sarzi-Puttini et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">2019</xref>). Cannabis and cannabinoids have also potentials which showed promising results to alleviate pain related to rheumatic diseases (Gonen and Amital

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">2017</xref>) by folk medicine practitioners. A cannabis-derived medicine containing THC and CBD, Nabiximols, is approved in several countries for pain and muscle spasticity (Ãœberall
