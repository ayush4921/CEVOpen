 <xref rid="pone.0246470.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>], the major profiles of PREO were determined as citronellol, geraniol, linalool, and L-menthone by GC–MS analysis (
 <xref rid="pone.0246470.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Citronellol, well-known as dihydro-geraniol, is the most abundant component of the oil. Geraniol, an acyclic monoterpene alcohol, is actually the main ingredient of citronellol synthesis in many plants. This compound is synthesized via ionization-dependent reaction or converted to citronellol by microbiological reduction [

With the available libraries, it was possible for us to accurately identify ~82% of the components in PREO, while the remaining 18%, which may contain the PREO metabolites, was not distinguished. Although the expected bioactivity was achieved in the identified components, inclusive libraries are required to determine unknown chemical compounds.
