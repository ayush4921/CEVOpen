<p>PREO is stable under normal temperature conditions, and the larvicidal assays of this study were performed under constant laboratory conditions; nonetheless, the effectiveness of EOs could be significantly influenced by post use temperature. This phenomenon has been noticed in the Pavela and Sedlakâ€™s study [
 <xref rid="pone.0246470.ref097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>] in which the effects of temperature on the insecticidal efficacy of an essential oil from 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic>, in terms of acute toxicity against the larvae of 
 <italic>Spodoptera littoralis</italic> and 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>quinquefasciatus</italic>, have been explored. They reported that the lethal doses significantly decreased with rising/decreasing temperature against 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>littoralis</italic>/
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>quinquefasciatus</italic> larvae, respectively [
 <xref rid="pone.0246470.ref097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. Therefore, the effects of ambient temperature on the larvicidal activity of PREO against 
 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>stephensi</italic> forms, which are often found in sub-tropical regions, call for further investigation.
