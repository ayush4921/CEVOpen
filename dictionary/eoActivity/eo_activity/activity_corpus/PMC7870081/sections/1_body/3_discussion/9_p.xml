<p>EOs are active against a broad variety of organisms with multiple mechanisms, though their anti-insect mode of action can be categorized as behavioral and physiological. Behavioral mode of action will be true in adult insects in which volatile components of the oil can disrupt the communication behavior of insects by blocking the function of antennal sensilla [

 <xref rid="pone.0246470.ref109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. The rapid action against some pests is indicative of a neurotoxic mode of action. The lack of octopamine receptors in vertebrates provides the mammalian selectivity of EOs as insecticides [
