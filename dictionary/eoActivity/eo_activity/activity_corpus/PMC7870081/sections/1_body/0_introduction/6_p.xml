<p>EOs are a blend of naturally occurring volatile aromatic and aliphatic compounds manufactured in plants as secondary metabolites [

 <xref rid="pone.0246470.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. These oils are important in biosciences for their antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, antiparasitic, anticancer, insecticidal, psychophysiological, neuroprotective and anti-aging activities [
 <xref rid="pone.0246470.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The reason why EOs are effective against a broad variety of pathogens is attributed to the existence of different chemical families of alcohols, ethers or oxides, aldehydes, ketones, esters, amines, amides, phenols, heterocycles, and chiefly the terpenes [
 <xref rid="pone.0246470.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In recent years, nanoemulsion-based delivery systems have been the focus of many studies. Thanks to their subcellular size, nanocarriers have potential to boost the bioactivity of EOs since they allow a wide tissue penetration and an effortless cellular uptake. Additionally, they render possible to adjust the release of active ingredients at the target site. The nanoemulsion-based delivery systems have been proposed to ameliorate the EOs’ physico-chemical properties by decreasing their volatility, improving the stability, and enhancing water solubility, as well as by protecting them from the interaction with the environment [
