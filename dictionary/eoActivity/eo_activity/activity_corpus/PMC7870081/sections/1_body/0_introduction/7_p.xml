<p>The idea that insects are colonized by numerous microorganisms, particularly bacteria, has widely been acknowledged by life scientists. The external and internal parts of the insect body, especially digestive tract, offer conditions and resources needed to support beneficial microbiota [

 <xref rid="pone.0246470.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. More recent studies have pinpointed that there is a potential linkage between insect gut microbiota and their susceptibility to insecticides [

 <xref rid="pone.0246470.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]; therefore, the sensitivity of gut bacteria needs to be taken into account prior to any intervention measures.
