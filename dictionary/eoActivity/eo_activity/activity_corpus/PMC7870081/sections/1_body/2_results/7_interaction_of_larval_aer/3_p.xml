<p>PREO-based formulations indicated antibacterial activity against four bacteria species in the following order of decreasing inhibitory: LC
 <sub>90</sub>, optimized nanoemulsions, and LC
 <sub>50</sub> (
 <xref rid="pone.0246470.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Overall, the optimized formulations showed better antibacterial activity in the individual interaction mode compared to the LC
 <sub>50</sub> and in the combined mode compared to the LC
 <sub>50</sub> and temephos (Pâ‰¤0.01). Also, in the combined interactions, the performance of the optimized formulations was similar to that of LC
 <sub>90</sub>. Details on the growth inhibition of bacteria exposed to different concentrations of PREO formulations are presented in the
