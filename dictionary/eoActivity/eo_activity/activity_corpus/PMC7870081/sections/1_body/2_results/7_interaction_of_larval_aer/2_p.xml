In treatments with only one bacterium, the growth of bacteria was well suppressed for up to 4 hpi, then increased exponentially up to 8 hpi, and eventually became constant to some extents by the end of the interaction. However, in the presence of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, the growth pattern occurred relatively in a linear manner (
