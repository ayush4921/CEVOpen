<p>Compounds were determined by comparing their respective mass spectra, retention time, and relative abundance of acceptance match criteria with those of standards and also by comparing with the NIST05 (National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and the Wiley Registry of Mass Spectral Libraries. The retention were indices calculated for each component using a mixture of n-alkanes (C9-C24) dissolved in n-hexane based on the following formula: Retention Indices = 100 Ã— [n + (Tu-Tn)/(TN-Tn)]</p>
