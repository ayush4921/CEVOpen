<p>Five fourth instar larvae of each 
 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>stephensi</italic> form were randomly selected for dissection and identification of gut-associated bacteria. Before dissection, specimens were washed twice thoroughly with sterile PBS (phosphate buffer saline) 1× and then surface sterilized in 70% ETH for 2 min. Guts were removed aseptically within a sterile PBS drop on a microscopic slide under a microbiological laboratory hood. Then guts were mechanically grinded in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes containing 100 μl of PBS. The homogenates were inoculated into BHI broth medium and subsequently plated on the BHI agar medium to obtain pure colonies. Colonies with different phenotypes were isolated and sub-cultured successively. Individual bacteria were identified using 
 <italic>16S rDNA</italic> sequencing method, as described in the experiments [
 <xref rid="pone.0246470.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Based on the frequency of colony-forming units (CFU) on the BHI agar medium, two bacterial isolates, one Gram-positive bacterium and one Gram-negative bacterium, were chosen from each form of 
 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>stephensi</italic> to explore the interaction of bacteria with the PREO formulations.
