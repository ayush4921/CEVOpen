<p>To reduce the volatility and improve aqueous solubility of PREO, 16 oil-in-water (O/W) nanoemulsions of the oil were prepared, as described previously [
 <xref rid="pone.0246470.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Briefly, different concentrations of TW 20 (2–16%) and ETH 96% (2–32%) were mixed at 600 rpm at room temperature for 5 minutes. Amounts of 11.44 and 12.55 ppm of PREO, equivalent to the calculated percentage of LC
 <sub>50</sub> values for

 <italic>stephensi mysorensis</italic> and 
 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>stephensi intermediate</italic>, respectively, were added to the TW (as surfactant) and ETH (as co-surfactant) mixture and stirred at the same conditions for 15 min. Subsequently, deionized water was gradually supplemented up to 10 mL and stirred further for 30 min.
