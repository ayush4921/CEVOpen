<p>Chemical constituents of PREO were characterized by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), which was achieved on a GC (HP 6890, Agilent, USA) equipped with a mass spectrometer detector (HP 5973, Agilent). The MS was operated in the electron ionization mode (70 eV). The MS ion source temperature and the MS quadrupole temperature were kept at 230°C and 150°C, respectively. Afterwards, 1 μL of the diluted sample (10 μL in 1 mL of heptane) was injected by autosampler using a 100:1 split ratio and analyzed on a capillary column (TRB-5MS, 30 m, 250 μm, and 0.25 μm). Helium functioned as the carrier gas (99.9995% pure), and its flow rate in the column was adjusted to 1 mL/min
 <sup>-1</sup>. The sample was assessed under the following settings: initial oven temperature at 36°C for 5 min, ramp-up at 4°C/min to 200°C and continued for 8 min, then increased up to 280°C with a ramp-up of 40°C/min for 10 min and overall run time of 66 min.
