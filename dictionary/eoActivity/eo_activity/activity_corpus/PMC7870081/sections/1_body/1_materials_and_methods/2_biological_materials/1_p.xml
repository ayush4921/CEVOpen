<p>Late third and fourth instars larvae of two BFs of 
 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>stephensi</italic> (mysorensis and intermediate) were purchased from the National Insectarium of Iran, Malaria and Vector Research Group. These strains were maintained separately in the laboratory conditions according to the MR4 standard protocols [

 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>stephensi mysorensis</italic> and 
 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>stephensi intermediate</italic> forms were from Chabahar City in Sistan and Baluchestan Province in Southeastern Iran and from Bandar Abbas City in Hormozgan Province in Southern Iran, respectively. Prior to any experiment, the BFs of the 
 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>stephensi</italic> specimens were determined by counting the number of egg ridges, as described in the literature [
