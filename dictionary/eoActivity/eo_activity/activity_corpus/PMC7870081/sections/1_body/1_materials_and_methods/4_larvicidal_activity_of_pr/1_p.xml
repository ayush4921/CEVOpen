 <xref rid="pone.0246470.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0246470.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0246470.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Due to the hydrophobic behavior of PREO, the oil was initially dissolved in ETH 96% as stock (100 ppm = 100 μg/ml), and subsequent concentrations were prepared by the stock dilution. Also, larvicidal activities of the main components of the PREO (citronellol, L-menthone, linalool, and geraniol) were evaluated both individually and in combination at two concentrations equal to LC
 <sub>50/90</sub> values in the same way. The components were evaluated individually based on the LC
 <sub>50</sub> (11.44 and 12.55 μl) and LC
 <sub>90</sub> (42.42 and 47.69 μl) values for the Chabahar and Bandar Abbas strains, respectively; the volume of each constituent increased up to 1000 μl with ETH. In the combined mode, each component under study had a concentration equivalent to a chemical composition in the crude PREO. Thus, for Chabahar strain, each component of citronellol, L-menthone, linalool, and geraniol at concentrations equivalent to LC
 <sub>50</sub> (11.44 ppm containing 7.15, 2.14, 1.41, and 0.74 μL, respectively) and LC
 <sub>90</sub> (42.42 ppm containing 26.51, 7.96, 5.23, and 2.72 μL, respectively) were prepared and made to a volume of 1 ml with ETH. For Bandar Abbas strain, the solutions were also made based on LC
 <sub>50</sub> (12.55 ppm containing 7.84, 2.36, 1.55, and 0.80 μL, respectively) and LC
 <sub>90</sub> (47.69 ppm containing 29.80, 8.95, 5.88, and 3.06 μL, respectively) values.
