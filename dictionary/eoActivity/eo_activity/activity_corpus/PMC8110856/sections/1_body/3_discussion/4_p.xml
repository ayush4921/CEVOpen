<p id="p0135">In both experiments, the 3 dominant bacterial phyla were Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria, but with a different ratio in the CTR samples (i.e., ethanol) between the 2 experiments (e.g., 31:37:23 in Exp.1 and 55:27:11 in Exp. 2, for Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria, respectively). Other studies (
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Jami et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2009</xref>) reported a considerable variation between animals concerning the abundance of the main bacterial phyla. In the present study, the rumen inoculum for the 2 experiments was collected from different animals fed different diets and reared in different conditions, which probably caused the observed difference.
