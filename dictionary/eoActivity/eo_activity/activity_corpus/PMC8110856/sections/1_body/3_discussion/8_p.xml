<p id="p0155">Supplementation with the additives markedly increased the total number of protozoa (i.e., 30-50%) in both experiments, despite the different experimental conditions (e.g., inoculum donor animals and length of incubation and doses). In agreement with these results, a study from 
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Broudiscou et al. (2000)</xref> showed that 
 <italic>Achillea millefolium</italic> increased large ruminal protozoa. The effect of essential oils on the protozoal population varies in the literature. Some studies reported a lack of effect (
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Benchaar et al., 2007b</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Newbold et al., 2004</xref>), whereas others found that essential oils had a stimulatory effect on the protozoa (
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Patra et al., 2006</xref>), although the mechanism was not elucidated (
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Patra and Saxena, 2010</xref>). An opposite trend between the in vitro CH
 <sub>4</sub> yields and the protozoa counts was found in our experiments, which was unexpected given the assumed role protozoa plays in the rumen methanogenesis process (
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Newbold et al., 2015</xref>). A meta-analysis by 
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Guyader et al. (2014)</xref> concluded that methanogenesis is also regulated by other mechanisms besides protozoa numbers because, in several experiments, a variation in CH
 <sub>4</sub> emission was observed without corresponding changes in the protozoa numbers. In addition, 
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Sarnataro et al. (2020)</xref> changed the concentration of the in vitro protozoa population by adding secondary plant compounds; however, the authors did not measure a variation in the CH
 <sub>4</sub> yield. Similarly, 
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Wenner at al. (2020)</xref>, in a continuous culture experiment, found that CH
 <sub>4</sub> yield was not decreased by defaunation.
