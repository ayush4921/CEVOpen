<p id="p0130">The SCFA profile was affected by the additive. In Exp. 2, EUCA increased the valerate proportion. 
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Ungerfeld (2015)</xref> suggested that an increase in ruminal hydrogen availability, following methanogenesis inhibition, enhances the fermentation pathways that consume hydrogen, such as the formate, valerate, and caproate biosynthesis process. The estimated CH
 <sub>4</sub> production was lower for EUCA than for other treatments. On the other hand, CAM and BOR increased the acetate proportion (without affecting the acetate to propionate ratio) compared to CTR, which was likely related to a better fiber digestibility. According to this hypothesis, the pH value of BOR was higher than that of CTR.
