<p id="p0165">The role of protozoa in the rumen metabolism is not yet well defined, but some concerns arise from their contribution to CH
 <sub>4</sub> and ammonia yields in the rumen. However, protozoa are a relevant fraction of the natural microbiota of the rumen and have some beneficial effects on the nutrition of the host. Protozoa engulf starch granules and are, therefore, considered able to attenuate the risks of rumen acidosis. Moreover, protozoa may contribute to fiber digestion. 
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Newbold et al. (2015)</xref> showed that the elimination of rumen protozoa significantly decreased NDF (−20%) and ADF digestibility (−16%), probably as a result of the loss of protozoal fibrolytic activity. Recent investigations also suggested possible positive effects related to protein nutrition because protozoa contributed 10 to 30% of the duodenal microbial protein flow (
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Sylvester et al., 2005</xref>) and were characterized by a higher lysine content than the rumen bacteria (
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Sok et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, the greater proportion of unsaturated fatty acids and CLA in the protozoa organisms could increase the supply of beneficial fatty acids for lower gut absorption by the ruminants (
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Or-Rashid et al., 2011</xref>). Given these considerations, a dietary additive that can increase rumen protozoa may have interesting applications that should be further evaluated.
