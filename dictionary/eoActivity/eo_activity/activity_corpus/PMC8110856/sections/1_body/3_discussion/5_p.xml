<p id="p0140">In Exp. 1 (48 h), all of the treatments increased the relative abundance of Proteobacteria and decreased that of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. 
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Wallace et al. (2015)</xref> found out that in beef cattle, there was a 4-fold abundance of Proteobacteria in animals with lower CH
 <sub>4</sub> emissions compared to those with higher emissions. Similarly, 
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Danielsson et al. (2017)</xref> reported a higher abundance of Proteobacteria in low-CH
 <sub>4</sub> emitting cows than in high-CH
 <sub>4</sub> emitting ones. These results appear to agree with the results for the EUCA and CAM treatments in Exp. 1.
