<p id="p0160">Different protozoa may have differing effects on rumen CH
 <sub>4</sub> production. 
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Belanche et al. (2014)</xref> demonstrated that holotrich protozoa have a different endosymbiotic correlation with methanogens than entodiniomorphids. These differences may explain the more significant impact of holotrich protozoa on rumen methanogenesis than the entodiniomorphids (
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Belanche et al., 2015</xref>). The results of Exp. 1 demonstrated a quadratic relationship between CH
 <sub>4</sub> and Ophryscolecinae, which were also negatively correlated to Proteobacteria. To the best of our knowledge, this relationship has never been reported in the literature.
