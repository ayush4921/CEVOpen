<p id="p0145">Although the effects were less marked, in Exp. 2, there was a higher Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio for EUCA than for CTR, and the Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio was found to be strongly correlated with daily milk-fat yield (
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Jami et al., 2014</xref>). However, 
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Delgado et al. (2019)</xref> found that more efficient cows presented a higher relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and a lower, but not significant, relative abundance of Firmicutes. A lower amount of Bacteroidetes in the digestive microbiota was also associated with an impaired feed conversion rate, residual feed intake (
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Jami et al., 2014</xref>), and an increased fat deposition in mice (
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Turnbaugh et al., 2006</xref>). Overall, a lower amount of Bacteroidetes in the rumen might redirect energy intake, resulting in an increased fat deposition at the expense of lowering milk production per unit of feed intake (
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Delgado et al., 2019</xref>). Hence, the possible use of EUCA as a feed additive should be carefully evaluated. Another effect observed in Exp. 2, due to the EUCA treatment, was the increase in the relative abundance of 
 <italic>Ruminococci</italic>. The bacteria belonging to this genus played a fundamental role in cellulose degradation (
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Christopherson et al., 2014</xref>). However, the increase of the abundance of 
 <italic>Ruminococci</italic> was not associated with a change in the fermentative pattern (i.e., acetate proportion); on the contrary, a decrease in the SCFA concentration was observed with EUCA supplementation.
