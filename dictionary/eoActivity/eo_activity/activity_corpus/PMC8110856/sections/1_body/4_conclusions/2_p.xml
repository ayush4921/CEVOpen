<p id="p0170">The results of the present study indicated that the essential oils from 
 <italic>A. moschata</italic> did not depress in vitro rumen fermentation, except for EUCA, and may have some interesting effects on rumen microbiota. Some of the compounds (EUCA and CAM) were able to reduce in vitro CH
 <sub>4</sub> yield, but this effect was not associated with the evident modifications of the methanogenic bacteria. In addition, there was a clear and relevant stimulation of all the essential oils studied in the protozoal population, which was also maintained during long-lasting incubations without adaptive phenomena. The lack of correspondence between the total protozoa counts and the CH
 <sub>4</sub> yield in the in vitro conditions requires further research efforts to elucidate the relationship between methanogens and protozoa better.
