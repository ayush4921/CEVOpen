<p id="p0095">The pH and total SCFA were not affected by the treatments (
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The CTR had the highest values (% of the SCFA) for 
 <italic>iso</italic>-butyrate (1.74) (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.003) and for 
 <italic>iso</italic>-valerate (3.11) (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), as compared to the other treatments (on average 1.62 and 2.79, respectively, for 
 <italic>iso</italic>-butyrate and 
 <italic>iso</italic>-valerate). Bornyl acetate and CAM reduced valerate (on average 1.69, % SCFA) as compared to CTR (1.81) (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.04). The acetate to propionate ratio was not affected by the treatment (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.299).
