<p id="p0115">The results of the continuous rumen fermenter are shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. The inclusion of BOR and EUCA increased the pH in the fermentation liquid (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). The production of SCFA showed a decrease of about 20% when EUCA was added compared to CTR (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.029), whereas this compound did not modify the proportions of different SCFA, except for an increase in the valerate (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.001) in comparison with the other treatments. Bornyl acetate and CAM increased the proportion of acetate in the fermentation liquid by about 10% compared to the CTR (61.26%, 58.44%, and 54.34% for BOR, CAM, and CTR, respectively). Valerate was modified by BOR inclusion, resulting in a lower value (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) than CTR and EUCA. The stoichiometrically calculated CH
 <sub>4</sub> was less for EUCA than for the other treatments (7.40 vs. 8.87 mmol/L on average, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.025).
