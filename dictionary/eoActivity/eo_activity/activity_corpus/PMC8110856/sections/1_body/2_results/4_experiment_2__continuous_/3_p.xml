<p id="p0120">Protozoa were affected by the addition of the 3 compounds compared to CTR, with an increase of about 50% (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). No modification for the protozoa groups was detected. The relative abundance of bacterial phyla and genera was affected by the addition of EUCA, which increased (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.011) the presence of 
 <italic>Ruminococcus</italic> (
 <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Moreover, the addition of EUCA tended to increase Firmicutes and decrease Bacteriodetes (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.090 and 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.084, respectively). The relative abundance of 
 <italic>Anaereovibrio</italic> was lower (
