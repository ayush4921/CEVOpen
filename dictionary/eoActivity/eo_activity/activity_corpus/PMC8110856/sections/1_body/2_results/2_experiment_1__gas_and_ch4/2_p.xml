 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The GP (mL/200 mg DM) was not affected by the additive. The CH
 <sub>4</sub> production as a percentage in the total GP at 48 h was lower for EUCA (22.5% in total GP) and CAM (22.4% in total GP), as compared to the CTR (24.2% in total GP) (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.044). Among the other parameters, tendencies (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.10) were found at 24 and 48 h for CH
 <sub>4</sub> production (mL/200 mg DM) and for the CH
 <sub>4</sub> percentage in the total GP at 24 h, with EUCA and CAM being the most promising compounds. The 2 essential oils did not affect any of the parameters evaluated.
