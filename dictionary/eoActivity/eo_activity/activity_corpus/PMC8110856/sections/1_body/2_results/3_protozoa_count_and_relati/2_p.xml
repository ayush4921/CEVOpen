<p id="p0100">The results of the protozoa count and the relative abundances of the main bacterial phyla and Euryarchaeota are shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. All of the compounds increased the total number of protozoa (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.006) compared to the CTR. The genus 
 <italic>Entodinium</italic> increased (on average 91.8% vs. 83.0% of the total protozoa, respectively, for samples treated with additives and CTR; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), whereas all of the experimental treatments decreased (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.001) the genus 
 <italic>Diplodinium</italic> (13.6% vs. 6.6% of the total protozoa, for the CTR and treatments with additives, respectively). The percentage of the other protozoa (Ophryscolecinae, 
 <italic>Isotricha</italic>, and 
 <italic>Dasytricha</italic>) was lower (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.018) in BOR, CAM, and EUCA (on average 0.91) compared to the CTR (3.38). There was a negative relationship (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) between the total protozoa and CH
 <sub>4</sub> production (% in total GP), although Ophryscolecinae were quadratically correlated (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.002) to CH
 <sub>4</sub> production (
