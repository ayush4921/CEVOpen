<p id="p0015a">The correlations among the protozoa and the main bacterial phyla and Euryarchaeota are reported in 
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Appendix Table</xref>. The most significant correlations showed that Euryarchaeota was positively correlated with Ophryscolecinae (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.697; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05), but negatively correlated with 
 <italic>Entodinium</italic> (
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.584; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). In contrast, Proteobacteria was positively correlated with 
 <italic>Entodinium</italic> (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.658; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). The regressions among the main bacterial phyla and the CH
 <sub>4</sub> emissions (% in total GP) are shown in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were positively related to CH
 <sub>4</sub> emission, whereas Proteobacteria and Spirochaetes were negatively correlated.
