<p id="p0015">Another issue in the search for feed additive-based mitigation strategies is that the rumen's microbial ecosystem may adapt to the inclusion of feed additives to the diet. In that case, only a transient reduction of CH
 <sub>4</sub> emissions may be achieved (

 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Cardozo et al. (2004)</xref> reported a transient effect of plant extracts on fermentation characteristics that disappeared after 6 d, indicating that microbial adaptation can occur after short-term exposure. Hence, the evaluation of the additive by a continuous rumen fermenter is another step that should be performed before conducting an in vivo study. This study hypothesized that the use of 
 <italic>A. moschata</italic> essential oils and their main pure compounds could affect rumen fermentation patterns because of a change in the rumen microbiome communities resulting in lower CH
 <sub>4</sub> production without negatively affecting fermentability. The objective of the current study was to investigate the effect of 
 <italic>A. moschata</italic> essential oils collected from 2 different locations in Italy and their main pure compounds (BOR, CAM, and EUCA) on the rumen fermentation and the microbiota. In vitro batch fermentation systems were used to screen the essential oils and pure compounds. In contrast, a continuous culture system was used to evaluate the potential adaptation of microbiota to the oils' pure compounds.
