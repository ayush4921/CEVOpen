<p id="p0050">Gas samples were analyzed for CH
 <sub>4</sub> concentration using an Agilent 3000A GC gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (170 °C) using a stainless steel column (Carboxen 1000, 60/80 mesh Supelco, USA) with helium as the carrier gas (30 ml/min, isothermal oven temperature: 120 °C). Gas calibration was completed using a standard mixture of CO
