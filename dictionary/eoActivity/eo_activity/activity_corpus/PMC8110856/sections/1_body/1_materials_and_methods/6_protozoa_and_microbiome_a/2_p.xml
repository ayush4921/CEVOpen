 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Dehority (2003)</xref>. For the extraction of the DNA from the rumen microbiota, 350 μL of rumen fluid was stored at −80 °C pending extraction. Particular attention was devoted to this operation; 350 μL were taken immediately after shaking, as the rumen fluid has rapid precipitation. In this way, all of the analyzed samples had the same characteristics. The DNA from the rumen fluid was extracted using the NucleoSpin Soil kit (Macherey–Nagel, Germany) following the procedures and using the reagents suggested by the kit manufacturer.
