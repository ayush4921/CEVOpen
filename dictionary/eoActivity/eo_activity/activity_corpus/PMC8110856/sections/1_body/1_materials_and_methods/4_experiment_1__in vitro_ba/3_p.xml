<p id="p0035">Rumen liquor was collected 2 h after the morning feeding. The liquor was strained through 4 layers of cheesecloth and poured into a flask, pre-warmed at 39 °C, and purged with carbon dioxide (CO
 <sub>2</sub>). The buffer solution was prepared according to 
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Menke and Steingass (1988)</xref>. The fermentation substrates were 2 TMR and the main ingredients were corn silage, cornmeal, solvent extracted soybean meal, alfalfa and grass hays (352, 172, 170, 145 and 133 g/kg DM on average, respectively) and contained 155 and 348 g/kg DM of CP and NDF, respectively. Approximately 200 mg of each TMR was weighed in duplicate in serum bottles (120 mL), and each bottle was inoculated with 30 mL of rumen inoculum and the experimental additives (2 
 <italic>A. moschata</italic> essential oils, BOR, CAM, and EUCA), following the procedure of 
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Menke and Steingass (1988)</xref>. A control sample (CTR; i.e., sample without additive) was also incubated. Each compound was dissolved in ethanol, and the compound concentration used was at 200 mg/L of inoculum. The concentration of ethanol in the final inoculum was 0.67% (vol/vol), in agreement with the findings of 
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Benchaar et al. (2007a)</xref>, where the final concentration of ethanol in culture fluid was less than 2% (vol/vol). The same amount of ethanol was added to CTR.
