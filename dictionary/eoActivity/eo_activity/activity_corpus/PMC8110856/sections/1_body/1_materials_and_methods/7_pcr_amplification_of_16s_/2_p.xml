<p id="p0075">In order to identify the bacterial community present in the rumen fluid, a portion of the 16S gene was used, as described by 
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Takahashi et al. (2014)</xref>. For the amplification, the following primers were used: Pro341F: 5′-CCTACGGGNBGCASCAG -3′ and Pro805R: 5′-GACTACNVGGGTATCTAATCC -3. The amplifications were performed using 5 μL of the extracted DNA in a final reaction volume of 25 μL using Platinum Taq DNA polymerase high fidelity (Thermofisher, MA, USA), following the manufacturer instructions. The amplifications were performed for 27 cycles using 55 °C as the annealing temperature. The libraries were purified with Beads Amplure XP 0.8X, amplified with Indexes Nextera XT Illumina; they were normalized, mixed, and loaded on Miseq using the 2 × 300 bp (paired-end) approach to generate a minimum of 50,000 sequences (±20%). The raw sequences R1 and R2 (raw reads) were verified and filtered by quality, trimmed by the primers, and fused by Qiime2 v8 software. DADA2 (Qiime2) software isolated the amplicon sequence variants (formerly operational taxonomic units), whose sequences were compared against the Greengenes v13-8 to obtain the taxonomic assignment.
