 <italic>A. moschata</italic> was collected during the blossom period in July 2017 in 2 different (in terms of altitude, geomorphology, lithology, and temperature influencing the essential oil composition) valleys of the Rhaetian Alps (located in Sondrio Province, Northern Italy). Specifically, the samples were harvested at 2,400 m in Valfurva and 2,000 m in Valchiavenna. Two voucher specimens (No. AMVF 104 and No. AMVC105, respectively) were deposited at the Department of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Milan State University (Milan, Italy) after their identification, according to the morphological traits described in Flora d’Italia (
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Pignatti, 1982</xref>). The air-dried aerial parts (50 g) of 
 <italic>A. moschata</italic> were subjected to steam distillation for 1 h in a Clevenger-type apparatus. The obtained distillates were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and were concentrated with a rotary evaporator at 30 °C to produce pale blue yellow oils. The 3 main compounds of 
 <italic>A. moschata</italic> essential oil, BOR, CAM, and EUCA, were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich (Milan, Italy).
