<p id="p0045">Three incubation runs were conducted in a shaking water bath at 39 °C for 48 h. At 24 and 48 h of incubation, headspace pressure was recorded using a digital manometer (model 840082, Sper Scientific, Scottsdale, AZ, USA), and a sample of air was collected from the bottle headspace using a gas-tight syringe (Hamilton, USA) and stored in gas-tight vials (Labco Exetainer Vials, UK). The gas pressure data recorded at each time-point were converted to the volume of gas produced (GP) using the ideal gas law. At the end of the incubation, pH was recorded, and 3 samples of liquor were collected: 10 mL for rumen microbiota characterization, 5 mL for the protozoa count, and 5 mL for SCFA determination. For protozoa analysis, 5 mL of 50% formalin solution was added to the samples, whereas for SCFA analysis the samples were acidified with 5 mL of 25% metaphosphoric acid. The samples for microbiota and SCFA were immediately frozen.</p>
