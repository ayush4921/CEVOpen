<p>Lipid peroxidation was estimated by measuring the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) by GC/MS in selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode, as the 
 <italic>O</italic>-pentafluorobenzyl-oxime (
 <italic>O</italic>-PFB-oxime) or 
 <italic>O</italic>-pentafluorobenzyl-oxime-trimetylsilane (
 <italic>O</italic>-PFB-oxime-TMS) derivatives using benzaldehyde-D6 as an internal standard [
 <xref rid="B33-antioxidants-10-00053" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. MDA was analyzed using a 7890A GC—7000 quadrupole MS/MS (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a HP-5MSms capillary column (30 m length, 0.25 mm internal diameter, 0.25 µm film thickness). The ions used were

 <italic>z</italic> 333.0 and 181.0 for MDA-PFB-TMS and 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 307.0 for IS derivative. Obtained results were normalized for milligrams of protein.
