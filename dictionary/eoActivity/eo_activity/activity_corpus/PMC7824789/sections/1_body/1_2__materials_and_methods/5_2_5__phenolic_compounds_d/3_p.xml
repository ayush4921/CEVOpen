<p>The separation and identification of phenolic compounds and determination of their radical scavenging activity were carried out using modular HPLC system consisted of mobile phase binary pump (Hewlett Packard, Waldbronn, Germany), autoinjector (Perkin Elmer, Norwalk, CT, USA), chromatographic column (125 mm × 4.60 mm LiChrospher 100 RP-18e, particle size 5 μm (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), UV detector (λ = 254 nm) “Spectra 200” (Spectra Physics, Norwalk, CT, USA), DPPH reagent pump (Phoenix 20 CU, Carlo Erba Instruments, Milan, Italy), DPPH reaction detector (λ = 517 nm) “Linear UVIS 200” (Linear Instruments, Reno, NV, USA) and data processing system. Mobile phases were as follows: A—bidistilled water, acidified with trifluoroacetic acetic acid (0.05% vol.), B—methanol. Following mobile phase gradient was applied: from 0 min. to 4 min. component B concentration is changed from 1% to 30%, on 20 min. B is set to 43%; on 30 min. B is set 50%, on 40 min.—B is set to 99% and hold for 5 min. Flow rate: 0.75 mL/min, injection volume 10 µL. Compounds were determined according to the retention times using external standard method. Retention time of standard compounds was accordingly: 
 <italic>trans</italic>-synapic acid—19.44 min., 
 <italic>trans</italic>-p-coumaric acid—23.27 min., hesperetin—23.83 min., rutin—24.73 min., rosmarinic acid—25.84 min.
