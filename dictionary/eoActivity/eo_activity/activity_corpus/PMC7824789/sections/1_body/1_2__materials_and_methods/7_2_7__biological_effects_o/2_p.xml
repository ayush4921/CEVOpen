<p>When the cells reached 70% confluence, they were exposed to UV radiation using Bio-Link Crosslinker BLX 312/365; Vilber Lourmat, Germany. UVB radiation dose was 300 mJ/cm
 <sup>2</sup> and was chosen corresponding to 70% cell viability measured by the methyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay [
 <xref rid="B32-antioxidants-10-00053" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] described in detail below. The distance between cells and lamps was 15 cm, what gave power density at 4.08 mW/cm
 <sup>2</sup> for UVB (312 nm). Control cells were incubated in parallel without irradiation.
