<p>The principal component analysis (PCA) biplot was applied to oxidative stress biomarkers and biochemical parameters (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="animals-11-00982-f007">Figure 7</xref>). Permanova analyses indicated the significance of temperature (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0. 001), diet (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0. 001) and their interaction (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001), giving importance to PCA analysis. The two components (factor 1 and factor 2) explained ca. 76% of total variance. PCA analysis showed that control and experimental groups exposed at low temperatures (13, 15, and 18 °C) were well separated on the plane from the same groups exposed to high temperatures (21, 23, and 25 °C), with some exceptions. Fish fed on CD and D200 diets and exposed to 21–25 °C were scattered on the upper part of the plane and shared the highest TBARS levels. On the contrary, D100 groups exposed to the same temperature were scattered on the right zone of the plane, and were mainly distinguished by the improved antioxidant enzyme activity and high serum protein levels.
