<p>Plant-enriched diets may represent an effective strategy to increase fish immunity and disease resistance in aquaculture. Several studies have revealed the immunostimulant, antioxidant, and antimicrobial potential of plant-based supplementation in fish diet [

 <xref rid="B16-animals-11-00982" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The use of plant supplements can also reduce the mortality rates and improve growth and feed assimilation, contributing to a better optimization of aquaculture resources. Whether medicinal plants can be administered to fish in several ways (e.g., intramuscular and intraperitoneal injection, immersion, or baths), oral administration seems to be the most suitable for aquaculture. Plants can be administered as a whole plant or parts (leaf, root, seed, fruit) and can either be used fresh or as powder, plant-extract, or essential oils (EO) [

Blood parameters act as insightful markers of physiological perturbations depending on extrinsic (e.g., temperature, season, dissolved oxygen, water quality, stocking density, photoperiod) and intrinsic factors (e.g., age, nutritional state, species) [
 <xref rid="B19-animals-11-00982" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Thus, previous studies investigated the levels of several blood parameters after EO administration, showing an enhanced health status of treated fish [

 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> (L.) EO and has a broad spectrum of biological activity [
 <xref rid="B23-animals-11-00982" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Consequently, carvacrol-rich oregano oils have been applied in farmed fish diet as growth- and health-promoter. Anyway, the specific mechanisms behind the observed physiological effects of 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> (L.) EO or carvacrol are still poorly described, as well as more research is needed to establish the most suitable preparations and the most appropriate treatment strategies. Adequate dosing is crucial to obtain the desired effects, since most of the plant bioactive molecules may result toxic or antinutritional at high levels. Treatment duration is another important parameter, since it directly affects the treatment effectiveness [
