<p>Anthropogenic impacts, including the emission of carbon dioxide, the overuse of pesticides and the discharge of industrial and household chemical wastes have been considered the main causes of environmental temperature global change. Most aquatic communities are particularly vulnerable to the thermal fluctuations, which may affect ecological aspects and anatomical (e.g., body insulation and locomotor system) and physiological functions of aquatic organisms (e.g., bloodâ€“water countercurrent respiratory system, metabolic rate, and osmoregulation) [

Low and high temperature extremes decrease the secretion and activity of digestive enzymes, leading to minor feed intake and growth efficiency. Alternatively, temperatures close to the optimum level promote food digestion by increasing the metabolic rate or reducing the intestinal transit time [

 <xref rid="B9-animals-11-00982" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. For these reasons, the environmental temperature has been defined as the main abiotic regulatory factor of basic physiological processes involved in animal growth, reproduction, and welfare [
 <xref rid="B10-animals-11-00982" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In order to adapt its metabolic rate to thermal variations, aquatic fauna has developed a temperature range with maximum and minimum tolerance limits. Physiological alterations impair the cellular redox balance with the consequent formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which may damage vital biomolecules such as DNA, protein, and lipid [
 <xref rid="B11-animals-11-00982" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For these reasons, antioxidant enzymes (e.g., superoxide dismutase and catalase) are used as biomarkers of fish health status due to their pivotal role in cellular defense systems against temperature-induced oxidative stress [
