<p>Due to its wide thermal tolerance range, large acclimation capacity, and low generation times, sea bass (
 <italic>Dicentrarchus labrax</italic> L.) has acquired a considerable commercial importance [
 <xref rid="B5-animals-11-00982" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Anyway, the climate change effects are predicted to represent great ecological challenges for this species [

 <xref rid="B25-animals-11-00982" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Sea bass grows best at temperature ranging from 22 to 24 Â°C, depending on the geographic region. In the wild, sea bass moves between deeper and shallow water, and seasonally between the open sea and lagoons/estuaries. Farmed sea bass is cultured in cage systems along the coast; therefore, it cannot alter their position to cope with daily and/or seasonally temperature changes and it has to face with continuous metabolic adjustments [
 <xref rid="B26-animals-11-00982" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. European sea bass may represent a good biological model for evaluating the impacts of temperature fluctuations in aquatic ecosystem [
 <xref rid="B27-animals-11-00982" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In our study, we tested the effects of oregano EO-enriched diets on the physiological and oxidative state of sea bass exposed to temperature shifts. Aiming to provide a scientific base for effective aquaculture practices, we collected a broad range of fish responses under different doses of EO and during a long treatment period.
