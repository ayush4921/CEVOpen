<p>Summing up, we investigated the physiological responses triggered by temperature changes in European sea bass, and the effectiveness of dietary EO supplementation in counteracting the thermal stress. Under exposure to thermal shift, EO affected fish growth and metabolic biomarkers in a dose-depending manner. The dosage of the EO is crucial to obtain the desired effects and thus deserves to be appropriately investigated. The addition of 100 ppm oregano EO improved growth performances, restored the antioxidant enzyme machinery (SOD and CAT), and activated the non-specific immune system by increasing the serum protein level. On the other hand, a higher dose (200 ppm) of EO was less effective in counteracting the thermal stress and was detrimental to the fish growth. Our findings are crucial for promoting the economic sustainability of dietary supplementation with EO, as low-dose treatments are cheaper than higher dosages. The nutritional strategy we proposed is easily transposable into the field and can benefit different aquaculture sectors, from small-scale fish farmers to intensive productions. The role of EO in regulating the antioxidant enzyme machinery and the non-specific immune system suggests a versatility of application. Likely, EO administration might potentially be effective as preventive treatment and as an alternative to antibiotics in several cultured species, and as sustainable treatment for diseases and stress management in farms of high-income countries. Further investigations should be taken on target tissues to understand biological mechanisms ameliorating fish conditions under temperature changes.</p>
