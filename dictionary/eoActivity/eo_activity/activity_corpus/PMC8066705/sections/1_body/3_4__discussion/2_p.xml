<p>It is known that one of the first signs of stress in fish undergoing temperature changes is the alteration of the redox state [
 <xref rid="B37-animals-11-00982" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. TBARS are good indicators of induced oxidative damage in cells. By raising temperature, our results showed an increased serum level of TBARS in fish fed on CD, especially switching from 21 to 25 Â°C when the activity of antioxidant enzymes (SOD and CAT) dropped. Results are in line with previous studies describing the oxidative stress in sea bass due to stressful temperatures [
 <xref rid="B38-animals-11-00982" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This was likely due to the inability of the antioxidant enzyme machinery to compensate for ROS-generating stressful conditions [

In particular, the protective effect against oxidative damages occurred with supplementation of 100 ppm diet, whereas it was negligible with 200 ppm. The interactive effect of EO and stressful temperatures has not been studied before and makes it difficult to compare our findings with others. High doses of EO were previously reported to be inefficacy or deleterious in sea bass dietary supplementation by Dinardo et al. [

Dietary supplementation with 100 ppm EO boosted the antioxidative status of sea bass through a considerable elevation of serum SOD and CAT. The same effect was not observed with D200, especially under the warmer temperature, likely due to the inability of the antioxidant enzyme machinery to compensate for the presence of both stressors (high temperature and high EO dose exposure). This resulted in a diminished protective action against oxidative stress and, ultimately, an increased lipid peroxidation [
