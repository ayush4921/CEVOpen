<p>Temperature fluctuations may induce metabolic and physiological imbalances over marine organisms. Aiming to find nutritional interventions on farms, able to reduce such imbalances, we investigated the correlations between temperature and metabolic performances in sea bass fed on oregano EO. In the present study, apart from the water temperature shifts, the other environmental conditions were held constant, including photoperiod and water quality [
