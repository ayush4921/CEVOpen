<p>A reduction of triglycerides in fish subjected to temperature shifts was previously reported by other authors [
 <xref rid="B60-animals-11-00982" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The decrease observed in fish fed on CD was likely due to the depletion at liver level of triglycerides and cholesterol to support the energy cost of gluconeogenesis [

 <xref rid="B63-animals-11-00982" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] demonstrated that carvacrol lowers hepatic cholesterol through the downregulation of genes involved in lipogenesis. Our results are in line with the study of Hong et al. [
 <xref rid="B64-animals-11-00982" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] which revealed a significant reduction of serum cholesterol when broiler chickens fed on essential oils containing carvacrol as major component.
