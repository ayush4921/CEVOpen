<p>The antioxidant properties of EO have been widely established, and attributed to the presence of phenols such as carvacrol, having a hydroxyl group in the phenolic ring lending a radical scavenging or metal chelating activity [

 <xref rid="B43-animals-11-00982" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Within this frame, we speculated that the antioxidant constituents of EO counteracted the oxidative stress induced by temperature increase. We also hypothesized a beneficial effect of EO going beyond the inherent antioxidant activity of carvacrol. As previously reported, the antioxidant enzyme machinery can be impaired when excessive oxidative damage occurs and substrate is accumulated (negative feedback) [
