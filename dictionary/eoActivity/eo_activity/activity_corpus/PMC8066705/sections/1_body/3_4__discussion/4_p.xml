<p>Serum glucose level is another index of thermal stress, and supply of glucose in bloodstream allows to cope with high metabolic needs in stressed organisms [

 <xref rid="B46-animals-11-00982" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In the present report, fish fed on CD showed an increase of serum glucose content upon exposure to 15 and 18 °C. As primary response to cold stress, the stimulation of glycogenolysis by catecholamines promotes the breakdown of hepatic glycogen and the release of glucose into the blood [

 <xref rid="B48-animals-11-00982" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The same hyperglycemic responses were reported in many species, such as sea bream, Nile tilapia, silver catfish, milkfish, and grass carp [

 <xref rid="B51-animals-11-00982" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Trend of blood glucose in control group at temperatures between 21 and 25 °C could be a consequence of depletion of hepatic glycogen stores and the subsequent activation of gluconeogenesis. The stimulation of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in sea bass subjected to thermal stress has been previously reported in several studies [

 <xref rid="B52-animals-11-00982" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Islam et al. [
 <xref rid="B38-animals-11-00982" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] detected low amount of blood glucose in fish reared both at low and high temperature extremes (8 and 32 °C). Samaras et al. [
 <xref rid="B9-animals-11-00982" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] found lower levels of circulating glucose in sea bass exposed to a temperature of 15 °C with respect to 25 °C. A direct comparison of results from different studies is not always possible due to differences in experimental design and techniques employed, anyway most of the authors agreed that thermal stress set higher energy demands, resulting in high glucose consumption rate and stimulation of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis [
 <xref rid="B9-animals-11-00982" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38-animals-11-00982" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. A similar pattern was reported in fish undergoing starvation and crowding stress or captivity [

 <xref rid="B54-animals-11-00982" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. On the contrary, the intake of diets supplemented with oregano EO led to reduced glucose levels. Several authors associated the reduction in blood glucose to the hypoglycemic effects of carvacrol [

 <xref rid="B58-animals-11-00982" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. By improving insulin sensibility and promoting intracellular glucose uptake, carvacrol treatment may also prevent ROS production and oxidative damage [

 <xref rid="B26-animals-11-00982" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] could explain the poor growth rates observed with CD compared to D100. On the other hand, the same beneficial effect of EO on growth performances was not observed with D200, likely due to the high EO dose exposure, which appeared to have a deleterious impact [
