<p>Fish were fed on three experimental diets: a control diet (Basic 3 commercial food pellet) and two diets which were supplemented with different concentrations of oregano (
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> L., 1753) essential oil (EO). The EO used in this study was obtained from Farmalabor S.r.l. (Canosa di Puglia, Italy). The chemical composition provided by the manufacturer is reported in 
 <xref rid="animals-11-00982-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Supplemented diets were prepared according to the protocol described by Dairiki et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-animals-11-00982" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and Dinardo et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-animals-11-00982" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Briefly, oregano EO was dissolved in grain alcohol to prepare EO suspensions at different concentrations. Commercial pellets were ground and the resultant powder was mixed with the EO suspensions to reach the final concentrations of 100 (D100) and 200 ppm (D200) of EO [

The mixtures were homogenized, pelleted, left to dry for 24 h at 25 °C, and stored at −18 °C until feeding. Each diet was tested in triplicate (three tanks per treatment). The fish were fed twice a day for 150 days until apparent satiety.
