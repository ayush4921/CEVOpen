<p>Treatments were performed in triplicate. Results were reported as means Â± standard deviations. Fish were used as statistical units (
 <italic>n</italic> = 12) after verifying the absence of a tank effect through a three-way nested analysis of variance (ANOVA), with temperature and feeding treatment as fixed factors and the tank as aleatory factor. Growth performances data were submitted to one-way ANOVA. A two-way ANOVA was used to analyze the effect of temperature and feeding treatments on oxidative stress biomarkers and biochemical parameters. ANOVA analyses were followed by the Tukey post hoc tests with significance level of 5%. In addition, oxidative stress biomarkers and biochemical parameters were subjected to principal components analysis (PCA) and statistical differences were evaluated using two-way PERMANOVA analyses. PERMANOVA test was performed with 999 permutations, with Euclidean distances as the distance measure and obtaining 
 <italic>p</italic>-values from permutations. Data were analyzed using Statistica 13.0 (Statsoft Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA) and PAST 4.05 (University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway).
