<p>Then, specimens were randomly distributed in 12 cylindrical fiberglass 2000-L tanks (4 treatments × 3 replications; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 35 individuals per tank). Nine tanks were exposed to same temperature conditions because they were inter-connected and linked to a re-circulating system, with a water flow of 7200 L/h (about eight total volume renewal per day) and equipped with mechanical and UV filters, a skimmer, a 3000 L biological filter and a 3000 L/h heat/cool pump. Ten percent of the water volume was renewed with reconstituted water every week. These tanks were placed in an air-conditioned room to support the increase in water temperature and to avoid heat loss during the experimental trial. There was constant aeration of the water with supplemental oxygen to keep dissolved oxygen values within the optimal range. Fish were progressively exposed to five experimental temperatures: 15, 18, 21, 23, and 25 °C, which reflected the natural water temperature range occurring in the southern Mediterranean region from mid-winter to mid-summer (

 <sup>−1</sup>) according to the seasonal trend. Four days before starting each exposure phase, water temperatures were progressively increased by 0.50–0.75 °C. After this period, the required experimental temperatures were kept constant for the remaining 26 days. The other three tanks were used as control at constant temperature (data not shown). These ones were placed in a different air-conditioned room and water temperature was constantly kept through a heat/cool pump at 13 °C during all the experimental trial (

The tanks were linked to re-circulating system with a water flow of 2400 L/h (about eight total volume renewals per day) and equipped with mechanical and UV filters, a skimmer, a 1000 L biological filter and a 1000 L/h heat/cool pump. In control tanks, constant aeration of the water was sufficient to maintain optimal dissolved oxygen values. All tanks were maintained at a 14:10 L: D light–dark regime. During the experimental trial, the water quality parameters (e.g., temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, total ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate) were monitored daily. Data about water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH and salinity were collected by means of a tester HI-9829 (Hanna Instruments, Padova, Italy) whereas total ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate were measured with colorimetric kit (Testlab Marin, JBL). The mean temperature values during each exposure phase were 13.05 ± 0.03 °C; 15.35 ± 0.01 °C; 17.90 ± 0.08 °C; 21.20 ± 0.01 °C; 23.15 ± 0.03; and 25.07 ± 0.21 °C. These range values were marked as groups 13, 15, 18, 21, 23, and 25 °C. During the 150-days experimental period, specimens were maintained under the following conditions: 7.4 ± 0.5 mg/l of dissolved oxygen, 7.5 ± 0.1 of pH and 30 ‰ ± 2 of salinity. Ammonia (NH

 <sup>+</sup>), nitrite (NO

 <sup>−</sup>) concentrations were kept below 0.05 mg/L, 0.20 mg/L, and 2.0 mg/L, respectively.
