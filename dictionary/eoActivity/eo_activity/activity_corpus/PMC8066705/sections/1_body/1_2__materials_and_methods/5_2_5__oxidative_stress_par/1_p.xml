<p>The thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) assay was performed in serum to quantify the peroxidative damage to lipids that occurs with free radical generation [
 <xref rid="B33-animals-11-00982" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Free radical damage to lipids result in the production of malonaldehyde (MDA), which reacts with thiobarbituric acid (TBA) under conditions of high temperature and acidity generating a chromogen that can be measured spectrophotometrically at 535 nm. TBARS levels were reported as nmol MDA/mL.
