<p>Serum superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC1.15.1.1) activity was carried out as described by Misra [
 <xref rid="B34-animals-11-00982" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The enzymatic activity was based on the 50% inhibition rate of epinephrine auto-oxidation at 480 nm. SOD activity was expressed as U/mL. Serum catalase (CAT, EC 1.11.1.6) activity was evaluated by following the decrease in absorbance of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> at 240 nm [
 <xref rid="B35-animals-11-00982" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to degrade 1 Î¼mol of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> in 60 s. CAT activity was expressed as U/mL. Each sample analysis was performed in triplicate.
