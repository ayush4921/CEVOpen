<p>A rapid vapour phase test determined the antimicrobial activity of the different essential oils according to the method of Lisin et al. (1999) [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-26-00155" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. This technique was conducted using a suspension with a standard McFarland turbidity of 0.5. After filling the Petri dishes with the MH2 culture medium, the bacterial suspension was inoculated uniformly onto agar using a sterile swab and left to stand for 15 min. Then 70 µL of oil was added to fill the lid. Petri dishes containing DMSO 5% or left untreated were used as solvent and growth controls. The plates were inverted and incubated at an average temperature of 37 °C for 24 h. At the end of the incubation period, the effect of the oil on bacterial growth was noted in terms of inhibition zone diameter (IZD) values (mm). This process was carried out three times under sterile conditions.
