<p>The MIC values for each EO corresponding to the highest dilution that does not present any visible disorder to the naked eye were recorded. The MBC was determined by quantitative subculturing. A volume of 0.1 mL of each test tube (including controls) was spread on MH2. These plates were incubated at 37 Â°C. After incubation, colony-forming units (CFU) were counted, and all tests were performed in triplicate. The MBC is defined as the lowest concentration of EO that kills the bacteria tested at 99.9 to 100%.</p>
