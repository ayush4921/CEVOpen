<p>For GC-MS analysis, the oil components were subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA). In the case of HCA, the dendrogram (tree) was produced using Ward’s method of hierarchical clustering with squared Euclidean distance between oil samples (with 95% confidence). The cluster analysis (CD) was carried out using the Euclidean distance and the Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean cluster algorithm. The determination of the effect of 
 <italic>Lippia multiflora</italic> Moldenke on the growth of 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> was conducted in three replications. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test was used to determine significant differences between the means of the inhibition zone diameter. Significance for all tests was determined at a 
 <italic>p</italic>-value of ≤0.05. HCA, CD and PCA also studied the correlation between the essential oil chemotypes and antibacterial activity. All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows (Version 24, IBM Corp. Armonk, NY, USA), NCSS Statistical Software (2020, Kaysville Utah, USA) and GraphPad Prism (Version 6, San Diego, CA, USA).
