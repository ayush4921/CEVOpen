<p>It is interesting to note that although 
 <italic>Lippia</italic> species have grown under the same edaphic and climatic conditions, there is a difference in the chemical profiles observed in plants groups from the same geographical areas. Three outgoing lots can be distinguished: L2 (Citral/Neral/Elemol), L3 (Verbenone/Ocimenone/Limonene), and L9a (Artemisia ketone/Limonene/Piperitenone). This phenotypic variability within the same species from the same region can be explained by the spatial influence of the environment on the plant [

 <xref rid="B75-molecules-26-00155" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. The importance of spatial distributions in pollination, competition, herbivory, nutrient cycling and other ecological processes in the variability of the content and quality of secondary metabolites is well documented [
