<p>According to our study, the activity of the EOs against gram-negative bacteria was greater than that against gram-positive bacteria. The results were not in line with previous research. Indeed, gram-negative bacteria are more resistant to essential oils than Gram-positive bacteria. Their outer membrane has a thick layer of impermeable peptidoglycan. It makes it difficult for antimicrobial agents to pass through and confers rigidity and resistance to gram-negative bacteria [

 <italic>Lippia</italic> collections is probably due to the synergistic effect that could occur in the oil and thus potentiate or not its biological activity. According to several studies, the antibacterial activity depends on the quantity of the chemical constituent in the EOs, i.e., at low concentrations they can interfere with the enzymes involved in energy production and at higher concentrations they can denature proteins [
