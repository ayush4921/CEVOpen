<p>The volatile oil of L1/L2/L3/L4/L5/L9a significantly inhibits the growth of tested microorganisms although they were more potent against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> than against other strains of bacteria (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00155-f008">Figure 8</xref>). Among those, L4 gave the strongest inhibition activity against all investigated pathogens with diameter values in the range of 25.67 ± 0.58 mm to 29.00 ± 1.00 mm. It seems that the presence of a high concentration of Limonene (37.20%), Ipsenone (19.40%), Piperitenone (14.00%), and Trans-tagetone (12.34%), in its oils was responsible for this higher antibacterial activity. Other essential oils L8a (17.33 ± 0.58 mm), L8b (19.33 ± 0.58 mm) and L9b (19.00 ± 1.00 mm) exhibited antimicrobial only against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. However, L6/L7 are inefficient.
