<p>The dendrogram from HCA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00155-f012">Figure 12</xref>b) presents two distinct main clusters, A and B. Cluster B could correspond to the L7/L8b group, in which L7C
 <sup>3</sup>/L8bC
 <sup>3</sup> were observed to be effective (+) against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (11.67 ± 1.53 mm/11.00 ± 1.00 mm), while L7C
 <sup>1</sup>/C
 <sup>2</sup>/C
 <sup>3</sup>, L8bC
 <sup>1</sup>/C
 <sup>2</sup>/C
 <sup>3</sup> showed negative results against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa.</italic> With the formation of subgroups in HCA and the results of loading and scores plots in PCA, it can be observed that oils are effectively divided according to their efficacy against the three bacteria. There are subgroups of L1/L2, which have shown better efficacy against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, and subgroups L7/L8b, L5/L9a/L9b, L3/L4 and L6/L8a, which are relatively more effective against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>.
