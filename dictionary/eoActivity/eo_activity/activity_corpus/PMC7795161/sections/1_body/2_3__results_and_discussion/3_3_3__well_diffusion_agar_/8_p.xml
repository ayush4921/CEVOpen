<p>In the last part of this study, we were able to determine the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) values following standard guidelines published by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards to characterise antibiotic activity [
 <xref rid="B111-molecules-26-00155" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. The MIC/MBC ratio was then calculated to determine the antibacterial power of the EOs studied. The interpretation of the results was based on the classification of Shanmughapriya et al. (2010). EO is considered to be bactericidal when the ratio is less than or equal to 2 and bacteriostatic when it is greater than 2 [
