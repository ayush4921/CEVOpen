<p>In the heat map (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00155-f012">Figure 12</xref>a), almost all the essential oils of the plants used in the study showed an effect against bacteria. The best results recorded were those against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, followed by 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, but they remain much lower than those produced by Gentamicin A (

 <sup>1</sup>/L3C
 <sup>2</sup>/L1C
 <sup>3</sup> observed the most important effects against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, L1C
 <sup>1</sup>/L1C
 <sup>2</sup>/L2C
 <sup>3</sup> against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, and L9bC
 <sup>1</sup>/L4C
 <sup>2</sup>/L3C
 <sup>3</sup> against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. It is also noted that all tested concentrations of L6/L7/L8a were ineffective against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. Similarly, for L7/L8a against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. These samples were also recorded as ineffective by the vapour technique previously performed (
