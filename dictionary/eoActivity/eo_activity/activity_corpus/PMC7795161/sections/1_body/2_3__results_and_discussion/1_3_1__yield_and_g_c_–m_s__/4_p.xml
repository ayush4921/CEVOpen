<p>Limonene (p-mentha-1,8-diene) is the only monoterpene that appears in all EOs. It is the most predominant compound in the EOs of L4 to L8a et L9b with a percentage ranging from 25.95% to 40.70%. Moreover, it is more present in the plants sampled in Mâ€™banza Kongo (40.70%) and Cazengo (32.83%) than in Tomboco (25.95%). By comparing the chemical profiles in the table, the synthesis of Limonene showed an evident fluctuation during the different stages of plant growth. It is present throughout the phases but is slightly higher in samples taken before flowering than in those selected during and after flowering. These differences may be due to the type of harvested part of the plant, the physiological metabolism, phenology or environmental changes in the biotic and abiotic factors and the geographical aspect, which were not the same in this study [
