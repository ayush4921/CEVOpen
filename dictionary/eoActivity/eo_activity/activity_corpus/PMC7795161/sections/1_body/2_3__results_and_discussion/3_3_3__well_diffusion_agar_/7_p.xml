<p>In our study, the plants that have shown the highest activity against the three bacteria strains are the ones that contain more Limonene. This one is reported to have antimicrobial properties against a wide range of bacteria [

Indeed, Limonene belongs to the family of cyclic monoterpene hydrocarbons known for their effectiveness against bacteria. Their mechanism of action consists of an accumulation in the plasma membrane and dissipation of the protons motive force causing a loss of membrane integrity [

 <italic>Lippia</italic> samples could not be attributed solely to Limonene. Common compounds such as Piperitenone, Ketone artemisia Ipsenone, Ocimenone, Citral, Neral, Elemol and other minor compounds have been detected. They could play a critical role by producing a synergistic and additives effect. Their antimicrobial activity is not attributable to a specific mechanism, but there are several targets in the cell [
