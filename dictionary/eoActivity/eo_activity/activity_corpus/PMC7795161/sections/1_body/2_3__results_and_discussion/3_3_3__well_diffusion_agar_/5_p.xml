<p>Two distinct groups can be observed in cluster A (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00155-f012">Figure 12</xref>): A1 and A2. In gr. A1, we first observe subgroups (1) of L1/L2, whose members L1C
 <sup>1</sup>/L2C
 <sup>1</sup> are effective (+) and L1C
 <sup>2</sup>/L1C
 <sup>3</sup> highly effective (++) against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. There are also L1C
 <sup>1</sup>/L1C
 <sup>2</sup>, which are effective (+) against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. and L2C
 <sup>1</sup>/L2C
 <sup>3</sup> very effective (++) against 
 <italic>E.coli</italic>. Sub-groups (2) L5/L9a/L9b, of which L5C
 <sup>1</sup>/L5C
 <sup>2</sup>/L9aC
 <sup>1</sup>/L9aC
 <sup>1</sup> are highly effective (++) against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, while L5C
 <sup>1</sup>/L5C
 <sup>2</sup>/L5C
 <sup>3</sup>/L9aC
 <sup>1</sup>/C
 <sup>2</sup>/L9aC
 <sup>3</sup> are effective (+) against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. On the other hand, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is sensitive (+) to L5C
 <sup>3</sup>/L9bC
 <sup>3</sup>, and highly sensitive (++) to L5C
 <sup>2</sup>/L9aC
 <sup>2</sup>/L9bC
 <sup>1</sup> samples. In subgroup (3) of L3/L4, the L3C
 <sup>1</sup>/L3C
 <sup>2</sup>/L4C
 <sup>1</sup>/L4C
 <sup>2</sup> are extremely effective (+++) against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. At the same time, L3C
 <sup>1</sup>/L3C
 <sup>2</sup>/L4C
 <sup>1</sup>/L4C
 <sup>2</sup> are effective (+) and L3C
 <sup>3</sup>/L4C
 <sup>3</sup> non-effective against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. There are also L3C
 <sup>1</sup>/L4C
 <sup>1</sup>, which are effective (+) and L3C
 <sup>2</sup>/L4C
 <sup>2</sup> highly effective (++) against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Finally, gr. A2 of L6/L8a showed negative results against 
 <italic>E coli</italic> (L6C
 <sup>1</sup>/C
 <sup>2</sup>/C
 <sup>3</sup>, L8aC
 <sup>1</sup>/C
 <sup>2</sup>/C
 <sup>3</sup>), but they are highly effective (++) against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (L6C
 <sup>3</sup>/L8C
 <sup>3</sup>
 <italic>).</italic>
