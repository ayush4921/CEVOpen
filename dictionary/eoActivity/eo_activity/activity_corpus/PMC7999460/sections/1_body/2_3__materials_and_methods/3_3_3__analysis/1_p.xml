<p>Method development for analysis of the extract was carried out with an HPLC system consisting of a Shimadzu LC-10AD pump, a SIL-10AD autosampler using a 200 μL sample loop, a CTO-10AC column oven, a SPD-10A detector. Data analyses were performed using the LC solutions software. The HPLC analyses were performed using an analytical column Waters Symmetry C18 (150 mm × 4.6 mm, 3.5 μm) by isocratic or in gradient elution. A concentrated stock solution of standards was prepared dissolving in acetonitrile an exactly weighted amount of the standards in a 5 mL volumetric flask; serial dilutions were performed obtaining solutions used to construct the calibration curves. A volume of 5 µL of each solution was injected. Peak area of each compounds was plotted vs. actual concentrations (mg/mL). Linearity was assessed through evaluation of the coefficient of determination (R
 <sup>2</sup>). Method details for each standard are reported below:
