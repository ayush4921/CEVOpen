<p>The cells were stained at 4 Â°C overnight with primary antibodies against influenza Nucleoprotein (NP) or Hemagglutinin (HA). After incubation, three washes with PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20 were performed and then the cells were stained with a mixture of fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies (fluorescence emission at 800 nm), properly diluted in Odyssey blocking buffer and fluorochrome-conjugated Cell Tag (fluorescence emission at 700 nm), for 1 h at room temperature. Cell Tag was used as control of the integrity of cell monolayer. Subsequently, three washes with PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20 were performed and plates were analyzed by the Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR). Integrated intensities of fluorescence were determined by the LI-COR Image Studio software and the relative fluorescence intensity (RFI) was expressed as percentage compared to untreated infected cells (100%).</p>
