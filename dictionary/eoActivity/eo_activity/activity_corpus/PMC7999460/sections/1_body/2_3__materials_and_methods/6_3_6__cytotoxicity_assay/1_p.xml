<p>The cytotoxicity assay was evaluated on cell lines used for influenza virus infection by the MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay. Briefly, cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 2 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well in 100 μL of complete RPMI medium without phenol red for 24 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, cell monolayers were treated or not with increasing concentrations (2.5–500 μg/mL) of compounds for 24 h at 37 °C. After 24 h, 10 μL of MTT solution (5 mg/mL) was added to each well for 4 h at 37 °C. Afterwards, each sample was acidified by adding 0.1 N HCl in isopropanol (100 μL/well) for 30 min in slow agitation to ensure that all formazan crystals were dissolved. Absorbance of samples was read at 570 nm, using an automatic plate reader (Multiskan EX, Ascent Software, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan, Italy). Untreated cells were used as control.
