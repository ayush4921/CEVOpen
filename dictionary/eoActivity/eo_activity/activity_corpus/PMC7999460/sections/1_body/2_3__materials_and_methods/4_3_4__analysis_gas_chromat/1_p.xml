<p>The analysis of 
 <italic>C. myhrra</italic> oil was carried out by a gas chromatograph equipped with flame ionization detector (FID) and a split–splitless injector and directly coupled to a mass spectrometer (MS) Perkin Elmer Clarus 500 model (Waltham, MA, USA). A Varian FactorFour VF-1 fused-silica capillary column (length 60 m × 0.32 mm ID × 1.0 μm film thickness) was used with helium as carrier gas (1.0 mL/min). A volume of 1 μL of EO oil was diluted in 1 mL of acetonitrile and the injection volume was 1μL. The chromatograph was equipped with a split/split less injector used in the split-less mode. The oven GC temperature program was as follows: from 70 to 250 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min, and held for 10 min; the injector temperature was 280 °C.
