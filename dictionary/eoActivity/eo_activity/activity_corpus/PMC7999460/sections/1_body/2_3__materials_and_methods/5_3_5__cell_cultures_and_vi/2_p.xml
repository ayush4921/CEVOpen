<p>Allantoic cavities of 11-day-old embryonated chicken eggs were used to growth influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 H1N1 (PR8 virus). Viral suspension was inoculated in the allantoic cavity and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C, then infected eggs were maintained overnight at 4 °C. Subsequently, the allantoic fluid was collected and clarified by centrifugation (2500× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 30 min). The recovered virus was used for the infection of MDCK and A549 cells. Allantoic fluid from uninfected eggs was used as reference for mock infection.
