<p>The powdered vegetable matter (1.30 kg) underwent the extraction process with an industrial-scale supercritical fluid extraction system SCFE-10 (Exenia Group, Pinerolo, TO, Italy). The supercritical CO
 <sub>2</sub> extractions were performed as previously reported [
 <xref rid="B20-pharmaceuticals-14-00243" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Briefly, in an apparatus equipped with 4200 mL extraction basket (with an internal diameter of 10 cm and an effective height of 42 cm) about 1.30 kg of myrrh was loaded at each run. Two filters of 80 μm were placed at both ends of the extraction basket and then placed in the 5 kg extractor vessel. The extraction parameters were set up as follows: temperature 65 °C, pressure 37 MPa and CO
 <sub>2</sub> flow rate 18 kg CO
 <sub>2</sub>/h. The oil was collected in a glass container, previously autoclaved and weighted. An amount of 1.30 kg of powdered myrrh yielded 45.5 g of a brown oily extract at temperature 65 °C, pressure 37 MPa and CO
 <sub>2</sub> flow rate 18 kg CO
 <sub>2</sub>/h.
