<p>A549 cells were seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 2.5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/mL for 24 h at 37 °C, infected with PR8 and treated or not with furanodienone (
 <bold>1</bold>) or curzerene (
 <bold>3</bold>) (80 μg/mL) at different phases of the virus lifecycle, as indicated in the Results section. Untreated infected cells were used as control. Cell supernatants were recovered to infect fresh monolayer and to analyze viral protein expression by ICW assay. Statistical significance of the data was analyzed by means of a Student

 <italic>p</italic> values &lt; 0.05 were considered significant. Data were expressed as mean ± the standard deviation (SD).
