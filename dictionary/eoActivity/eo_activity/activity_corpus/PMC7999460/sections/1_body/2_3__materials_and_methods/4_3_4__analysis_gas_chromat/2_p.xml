<p>The electron-impact ionization mass spectrometer was operated as follows: ionization voltage, 70 eV; ion source temperature, 200 °C; scan mode, 40.0–450.0 mass range. GC–FID analyses were performed under the same operative conditions as described for the GC–MS measurements. The FID temperature was 280 °C. The identification of the components was assigned by matching their mass spectra with that reported on MS library search (Wiley and Nist). Furthermore, linear retention indices (LRIs) were calculated using a mixture of aliphatic hydrocarbons (
 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes C8-C30, Ultrasci) injected directly into GC injector at the same temperature program described above and compared with those reported in reference libraries. Two components were also identified by co-injection with an authentic sample. The semi-quantitative analysis was performed by normalizing the peak area generated in FID (%) without using corrections factors (RRFs). The analysis was repeated three times.
