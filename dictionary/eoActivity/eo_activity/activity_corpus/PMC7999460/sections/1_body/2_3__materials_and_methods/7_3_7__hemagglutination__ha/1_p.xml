<p>Virus production was evaluated in the supernatants of infected cells recovered 24 h after infection, by measuring the hemagglutinin units (HAU), using human type 0 Rh+ erythrocytes [
 <xref rid="B19-pharmaceuticals-14-00243" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Stock solutions of compounds dissolved in DMSO were diluted in RPMI medium to final concentrations of 2.5–500 µg/mL. Compounds were added after the adsorption period and maintained in the culture media until the end of the experiments. The highest DMSO concentration present in the culture medium was 0.2%. Control cells were treated with DMSO alone at the same concentration present in the test substance being evaluated.
