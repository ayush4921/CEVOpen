<p>Here we describe the extraction of 
 <italic>C. myrrha</italic> by supercritical CO
 <sub>2</sub>, an extraction method that is well known for its many advantages in obtaining volatile extracts or aroma substances and, more generally, to extract lipophilic compounds from a wide variety of matrices. Indeed, in addition to being non-toxic and non-flammable, the mild extraction conditions allow avoiding undesired chemical reactions during the process. This leads to shorter extraction times without decomposing compounds vulnerable to high temperatures differently from hydro- or steam-distilled oils [

In the present work, the analysis of myrrh oil and the quantification of its metabolites were performed by HPLC, so as to avoid high temperatures also during the analytical process. Our interest in substances endowed with antiviral activity [
 <xref rid="B13-pharmaceuticals-14-00243" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and in the field of biologically active natural products [
 <xref rid="B14-pharmaceuticals-14-00243" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] prompted us to evaluate the antiviral activity against influenza A virus of both the volatile myrrh extracts and of the single sesquiterpenes furanodienone (
 <bold>1</bold>), furanoeudesma-1,3-diene (
 <bold>2</bold>), curzerene (
 <bold>3</bold>) and β-elemene (
 <bold>4</bold>). In particular, we tested the myrrh extracts both alone and in combination with vitamin E acetate (α-tocopheryl acetate) in order to reduce the cytotoxic effects of the volatile oil. We decided also to investigate the activity of curzerene, furanodienone, furanoeudesma-1,3-diene and β-elemene 
 <bold>1</bold>–
 <bold>4</bold>, being the main bioactive components of the volatile oil of 
 <italic>C. myrrha</italic> [
