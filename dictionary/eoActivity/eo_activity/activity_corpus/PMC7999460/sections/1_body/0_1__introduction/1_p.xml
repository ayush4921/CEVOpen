 <italic>Commiphora</italic> genus (Burseraceae) includes more than 150 species especially occurring in northeastern Africa, southern Arabia and India [
 <xref rid="B1-pharmaceuticals-14-00243" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The species 
 <italic>Commiphora myrrha</italic> (Nees) Engl. produces a resinous exudate known as true myrrh that has been used for centuries as an embalming ointment, wound-healing remedy and for other medicinal applications [
 <xref rid="B2-pharmaceuticals-14-00243" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Myrrh consists of alcohol-soluble resins and volatile oil together with a gum soluble in water containing polysaccharides, proteins and long chain aliphatic derivatives. The lipophilic part of myrrh is composed of steroids, sterols and terpenes [
 <xref rid="B3-pharmaceuticals-14-00243" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. To date, hundreds of metabolites have been identified in the volatile component of myrrh, where sesquiterpenes are the major components. Notably, furanosesquiterpenes such as furanoelemanes, furanoeudesmanes, and furanogermacranes are the characteristic constituents of myrrh oil [
 <xref rid="B4-pharmaceuticals-14-00243" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. As important components of volatile oil, sesquiterpenoids possess diverse biological activities, including antibacterial, antifungal, and antiparasitic properties. It is also worthy of note that recent papers reported the in vitro and in vivo analgesic and anticancer activities [
