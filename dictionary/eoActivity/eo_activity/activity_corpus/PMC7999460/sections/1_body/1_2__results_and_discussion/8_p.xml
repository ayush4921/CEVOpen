<p>Compounds were added at different concentrations (30, 60 and 100 µg/mL) after the infection and maintained for the following 24 h. Viral replication was measured by means of HAU/mL. As shown in 
 <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-14-00243-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, compounds furanodienone (
 <bold>1</bold>) and curzerene (
 <bold>3</bold>) were effective at 60 and 100 µg/mL, even though the latter concentration was quite toxic for both compounds. In particular, for compound 
 <bold>1</bold>, the viral titer was of 6 and 2 HAU/mL, at 60 and 100 µg/mL, respectively; for compound 
 <bold>3</bold>, the viral titer was of 3 at 60 µg/mL, while no viral titer was observed at a concentration of 100 µg/mL. With regard to 
 <bold>2</bold>, no inhibition was observed at any concentrations used (data not shown).
