<p>Thus, the antiviral activity of the effective compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>3</bold> was analyzed by measuring the RFI of HA protein by ICW assay. However, the highest concentration of 100 µg/mL was quite toxic for both compounds, therefore, we chose a lower concentration to exclude that the antiviral activity may be in part due to the cytotoxicity of compounds. Therefore, to deepen the mechanism of action of furanodienone (
 <bold>1</bold>) and curzerene (
 <bold>3</bold>)
 <bold>,</bold> 80 µg/mL was added to cells at different steps of infection: only before infection (2 h, PRE), only during infection (1 h, DUR), immediately after infection and maintained for the following 24 h (POST). Compounds were also maintained for all the time of infection (before, during and after) but in this condition, they both became toxic for the cells, and data were not considered valid. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-14-00243-f004">Figure 4</xref>, both compounds were effective at specific phases: compound 
 <bold>1</bold> was mainly effective when added PRE or POST (** 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001); for compound 
 <bold>3,</bold> although quite effective at all the phases, the most inhibition (46% compared to untreated cells) was reached during viral challenge (DUR). On the basis of these results, we hypothesize that compound 
 <bold>1</bold> might act before infection by interfering with some cell factors on the plasma membrane or, due to the antioxidant activity of furanodienone [

 <xref rid="B19-pharmaceuticals-14-00243" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. With regard to compound 
 <bold>3</bold>, since it mainly acts during viral adsorption, it might interfere with the viral attachment or entry into the cells.
