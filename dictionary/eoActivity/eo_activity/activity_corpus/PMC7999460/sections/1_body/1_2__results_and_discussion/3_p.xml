<p>The extract obtained by supercritical fluid extraction (SCFE) using supercritical CO
 <sub>2</sub> as solvent has been evaluated in vitro for its antiviral activity against influenza A Puerto Rico 8/34/H1N1 virus (PR8). First, we evaluated the eventual toxicity of compounds on the cell monolayers. Therefore, intact monolayers of A549 cells were treated with different concentrations (3–100 µg/mL) of myrrh oil. DMSO was used as control. The integrity of cell monolayers was evaluated by using a vital dye (Cell Tag) of cells and revealed by In-Cell Western assay (ICW). Myrrh oil alone was toxic at the highest concentrations: the integrity of cell monolayer was damaged of about 30, 71 and 76% compared to DMSO alone at 25, 50 and 100 µg/mL, respectively (data not shown). Due to the low stability of myrrh oil and its components in the air-oxygen environment, we hypothesized that the cytotoxicity of myrrh could be ascribed to the decomposition of the components of this oil. Thus, we decided to add a compound endowed with antioxidant properties to the extract. To this end, α-tocopheryl acetate and a mixture myrrh oil (3–100 µg/mL) plus α-tocopheryl acetate (1%

Indeed, the percentage of relative fluorescence intensity (RFI) of Cell Tag indicated a recovery of cell integrity, reaching the same percentage of not toxic concentrations (
