<p>All the compounds were first tested for their potential toxicity on cell monolayer at different concentrations: furanodienone (
 <bold>1</bold>), curzerene (
 <bold>3</bold>) and β-elemene (
 <bold>4</bold>) at a range of 30–500 µg/mL; furanoeudesma-1,3-diene (
 <bold>2</bold>) at 2.5–30 µg/mL (due to the availability of a low amount of the standard compound). We found that compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>3</bold> showed toxicity at higher doses (starting from 100 µg/mL), while compound 
 <bold>4</bold> was highly toxic at all the concentrations used. For this reason, the latter compound was excluded for the following experiments.
