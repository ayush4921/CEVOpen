<p>To determine the amount of the major sesquiterpenoids (
 <bold>1</bold>–
 <bold>4</bold>) in our extract, an HPLC analysis was carried out. The percentage of each sesquiterpene is reported in 
 <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-14-00243-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. It is possible to notice that furanoeudesma-1,3-diene is the most abundant while no furanodienone was detected in our extracts. Our results are in good agreement with those found by Marongiu et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-pharmaceuticals-14-00243" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] who obtained supercritical fluid extraction (SCFE) myrrh oil made up of the following main components: furanoeudesma-1,3-diene (26.2%), curzerene (9.7%), and β-elemene (3.0%) without detecting any amount of furanodienone. A run at low temperature was used for the HPLC analysis to isolate compound 
 <bold>3</bold> given that it could not be separated from other compounds in the mixture at higher temperatures.
