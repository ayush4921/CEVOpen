<p>Therefore, since the addition of α-tocopheryl acetate (1%

The mixture strongly reduced viral replication in a dose-dependent manner (see 
 <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-14-00243-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The viral titer was determined by evaluating the presence of hemagglutinating activity in the supernatant of infected cells. When the cells were treated with myrrh oil alone or in combination with vitamin E (Vit. E), a decrease in viral titer expressed as HAU/mL values was measured, with no observed viral titer at concentration of 50 μg/mL. The Vit. E acetate alone did not interfere with viral replication: indeed, at concentrations ranging from 0.03 to 1 μg/mL, the values of viral titer were equal to 8 HAU/mL, as for the control (DMSO).
