<p>To further investigate the antiviral activity of myrrh oil components, we decided to test also furanodienone (
 <bold>1</bold>), furanoeudesma-1,3-diene (
 <bold>2</bold>), curzerene (
 <bold>3</bold>), and Î²-elemene (
 <bold>4</bold>) on A549 cells infected with PR8 virus. Indeed, these secondary metabolites are reported to be the main bioactive components of 
 <italic>C. myrrha</italic> oil commercially available.
