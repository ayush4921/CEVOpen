<p>To confirm the antiviral activity of the mixture, cells were treated with the highest concentrations (25, 50 and 100 µg/mL) of myrrh oil alone, myrrh oil + Vit. E (1%) and Vit. E (1%). The expression of viral nucleoprotein (NP) was analyzed by ICW, a method that allows the evaluation of the expression of viral proteins directly on an infected monolayer [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-14-00243-f003">Figure 3</xref>, the expression of NP was significantly reduced using myrrh oil at 25 and 50 µg/mL in mixture with Vit. E acetate, compared to Vit. E treated–infected cells (considered as 100%). In particular, the percentage of RFI was 89.7 ± 3% (*
