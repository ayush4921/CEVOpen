<p>To investigate the volatile composition of 
 <italic>C. myrrha</italic> oil, gas-chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) technique was used. Twenty-two volatile compounds were identified representing an average of 99.9% of the oil composition and they are listed in 
 <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-14-00243-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The most abundant component was furanoeudesma-1,3-dione (31.1%) followed by curzerene (23.1%), germacra-1(10),7,11-trien-15-oic acid, 8,12-epoxy-6-hydroxy-gamma-lactone (14.4%), lindestrene (11.9%) and other minor compounds.
