<p>In conclusion, we reported the extraction of 
 <italic>C. myrrha</italic> by supercritical CO
 <sub>2</sub>, an extraction method that allowed avoiding undesired chemical reactions during the process. In addition, the analysis of the obtained myrrh oil and the quantification of its metabolites were performed by HPLC, so as to avoid high temperatures also during the analytical process. Interestingly, our study demonstrated that myrrh oil shows antiviral activity against influenza A Puerto Rico 8/34/H1N1 virus. Due the toxicity exerted by myrrh oil alone on the cell lines used for viral infection, we decided to add Vit. E acetate (1% 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) that led to an increase in the viability of cells treated with the extract. It was also possible to appreciate the antiviral activity of myrrh oil plus Vit. E acetate. In particular, in the hemagglutination assay, the mixture of myrrh oil and the antioxidant compound showed a reduction in viral replication in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the expression of viral nucleoprotein was reduced using myrrh oil at 25 and 50 Âµg/mL in mixture with Vit. E acetate. Lastly, to investigate the antiviral activity of the main myrrh oil components, the single sesquiterpenes commercially available were tested. At non-toxic concentrations, the most active compounds, curzerene and furanodienone, proved to be effective at different steps of the virus lifecycle: furanodienone was mainly effective before and immediately after infection while curzerene was mainly active during viral adsorption. According to our results, myrrh and its metabolites may be useful to develop new antiviral agents active against influenza virus.
