  <p>The mixture myrrh oil and vitamin E (Vit. E) acetate increased cell viability. A549 cells were treated with different concentrations (3–100 µg/mL) myrrh oil, Vit. E acetate (0.03–1 µg/mL) and a mixture of myrrh oil (3–100 µg/mL) with Vit. E acetate (0.03–1 µg/mL). Cells treated with DMSO were used as control. After 24 h, cell monolayers were fixed and stained with Cell Tag. The effect of compounds on the integrity of cell monolayers was analyzed by In-Cell Western assay (ICW), using LI-COR Image Studio Software. Images are representative of one experiment of two replicates, each performed in duplicate. The graph indicates the percentage of relative fluorescence intensity (RFI) of Cell Tag expressed on myrrh oil and myrrh oil + Vit. E acetate compared to Vit. E acetate is considered as 100%. Values are the mean ± S.D. of two replicates of one experiment performed in duplicate (
