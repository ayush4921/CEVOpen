  <p>The mixture myrrh oil and Vit. E acetate inhibits influenza A virus replication. A549 cells were infected with PR8 and, after viral adsorption, treated with different concentrations myrrh oil (25, 50 and 100 µg/mL), Vit. E acetate (0.25–1 µg/mL) and myrrh oil (25, 50 and 100 µg/mL) in mixture with Vit. E acetate (0.25–1 µg/mL). Cells infected with PR8 and treated with DMSO were used as control. After 24 h, cell monolayers were fixed and the expression of viral nucleoprotein (NP) was analyzed by ICW, using LI-COR Image Studio Software. Images are representative of one experiment of two replicates, each performed in duplicate.</p>
