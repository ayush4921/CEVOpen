  <p>Compounds 1 and 3 affect different steps of virus lifecycle. A549 cells were infected with PR8 and treated or not with furanodienone (
   <bold>1</bold>) or curzerene (
   <bold>3</bold>) at different phases of the virus life cycle: the compounds were added for 2 h before (PRE); during viral adsorption for 1 h (DUR); immediately after viral adsorption and maintained for 24 h (POST). After 24 h infection, supernatants were recovered and used to infect a fresh monolayer of MDCK cells. The expression of viral Hemagglutinin (HA) was analyzed by ICW assay, using LI-COR Image Studio Software, as described in Methods. The percentage of RFI was calculated in comparison to Infected (I) cells (considered 100%). Values are the mean Â± S.D. of three replicates (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3) of one out two experiments performed. Statistical significance of the data vs. I was defined as * 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 and ** 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001.
