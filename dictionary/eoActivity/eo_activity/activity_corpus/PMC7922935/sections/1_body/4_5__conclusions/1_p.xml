<p>In conclusion, our review highlighted that EOs provide many other benefits apart from its common usage as fragrances and flavours, especially for its significant role in neurodegenerative disease therapy. Their roles in reducing disease severity are exerted by different mechanisms that vary respective of their origin. Although human studies were not obtained as part of our search, we strongly believe that the presence of essential components such as 1,8-cineole, carvacrol, or Î²-asarone could play significant roles in efforts towards the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, it is vital that the search for novel species of EOs are continued, to explore oils which could be applied towards the application of EO-based therapies or treatment strategies intended for age-related neurodegenerative disorders.</p>
