<p>All the related articles were printed out for further evidence-based assessment to explore the effectiveness of EOs as a neuroprotective remedy for age-related neurodegenerative diseases. After conducting the comprehensive literature review, the articles were selected and divided into several types of neurodegenerative diseases (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-01107-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). A total of 103 articles were included in this review. Eighty-six articles on AD were found, which consisted of 53 articles on in vitro studies, 20 articles on in vivo studies, 11 articles on the combination of in vitro and in vivo studies, and 2 articles on a combination of in vitro and ex vivo studies. Thirteen articles on PD were found, which consisted of four articles on in vitro studies, six articles on in vivo studies, one article on the combination of in vitro and in vivo studies, and two articles on a combination of in vivo and ex vivo studies. Four articles were categorised as a combination of diseases because several neurodegenerative diseases were mentioned in the articles at once. Unfortunately, no classifiable study was recorded on HD and ALS. Besides the standard biochemical assay, some studies also reported on the chemical composition of the selected EOs.
