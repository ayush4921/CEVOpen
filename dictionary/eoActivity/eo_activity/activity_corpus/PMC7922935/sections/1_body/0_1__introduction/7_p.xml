<p>A significant change that correlates to the age-related loss of substantia nigra (SN) dopaminergic cells is the loss of neostriatum dopaminergic innervation. Compelling studies have shown that the involvement of monoamine oxidase (MAO) in AD and neurodegenerative diseases is an important factor in many major pathophysiological pathways [

 <xref rid="B41-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. MAO-B has been suggested as a biomarker, and its activated form leads to cognitive dysfunction, kills cholinergic neurons, induces cholinergic disorders, and contributes to the development of amyloid plaques. Studies in molecular biology have demonstrated the critical role of Aβ generation through the modulation of the processing of APP by MAO [
