<p>Neurodegenerative disorders are often characterised by strong evidence of oxidative stress in their pathogenesis, as a consequence of unregulated synthesis of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [

Disparity observed in pro-oxidant and antioxidant cellular mechanisms inter-related with mitochondrial dysfunction, lipid peroxidation, neuroinflammatory processes, and endogenous dopamine metabolism are among the contributing factors to deregulation [

 <xref rid="B11-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Many researchers have searched for molecules that activate blocking pathways or minimise the effects of ROS [

 <xref rid="B13-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In an effort to overcome the limitations of current therapeutics available for neurodegenerative disorders, substantial research is being undertaken to explore and identify the availability of other possible natural drugs that are equally effective and without any side effects. As such, natural components composed of various polyphenolic phytochemicals have gained notable insight for this purpose [
