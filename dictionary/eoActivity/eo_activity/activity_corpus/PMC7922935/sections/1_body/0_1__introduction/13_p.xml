The degeneration of cortical motor neurons and anterior horn cells of the spinal cord is characterised by ALS, also known as Charcot’s or Lou Gehrig’s disease. This contributes, usually within 3–5 years of diagnosis, to muscle atrophy, loss of muscle function, and death resulting from respiratory failure. The diverse clinical variability in ALS is believed to be due to differences in upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) involvement, extra-motor symptoms, onset age, survival, and progression rates. Heterogeneity of the disease prevents biomarker production which hinders the accurate evaluation of candidate drugs in clinical trials [
