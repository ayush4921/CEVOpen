<p>The next common neurodegenerative disease is HD; caused by the recurrent development of cytosine–adenine–guanine (CAG) in the huntingtin (HTT) gene and involves a network of complex pathogenic mechanisms. HD is a profoundly penetrating, autosomal dominant, progressive neurodegenerative movement and neurobehavioural disorder associated with a variety of motor signs, psychological symptoms and cognitive dysfunction that progress with dementia. Knowledge of HD’s causal mutation allows the detection of an ever-expanding number of HD phenotypes and phenocopies. The mean starting age is around 40 years, with a recorded range of 2 to 79+ years [
