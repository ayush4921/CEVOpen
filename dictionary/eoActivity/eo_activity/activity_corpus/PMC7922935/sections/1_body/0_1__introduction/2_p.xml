<p>The brainâ€™s central nervous system (CNS) is composed of diverse neurons responsible for the organisation of neuronal and non-neuronal cells, as well as handling various motor, sensory, regulatory, behavioural, and cognitive functions. The neuronal cells are diverse in their morphology and function, suggesting that each neuronal type may indicate its own genomic profile despite having identical genetic codes. Within the CNS, specific regions were noticed to exhibit different vulnerabilities to ageing and various age-related neurodegenerative diseases [
