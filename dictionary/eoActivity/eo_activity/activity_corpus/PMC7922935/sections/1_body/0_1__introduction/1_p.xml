<p>Aromatic plants consist of a wide and diverse array of organic compounds with significant ecological and physiological functions. One of the most vital components synthesised by aromatic plants are essential oils (EOs), along with its secondary metabolites and phenolic compounds [

 <xref rid="B4-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Generally, monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes are the main constituents of EOs. Phenolic compounds are generated via biochemical synthesis and consist of a chemically heterogeneous group. Phenolic acids, simple phenols, coumarins, flavonoids, stilbenes, lignans, lignins, as well as hydrolysable and condensed tannins are among the well-established phenolic compounds [

EOs are well-known for various benefits that include its antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, memory enhancement, medicinal remedy, food preservation, cosmetic preservative, aromatherapy, and many other applications. For example, EO sourced from 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> sp., which is one of the most common medicinal plant species, was reported for its notable remedy in cough, bronchitis, herpes, thrush wounds, as well as in impaired concentration. The EO of this species is also applied in the food industry and cosmetic industry, for ranges of perfume products [
