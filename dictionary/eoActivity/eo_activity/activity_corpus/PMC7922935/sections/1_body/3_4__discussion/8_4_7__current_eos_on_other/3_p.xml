<p>In the in vivo research conducted by Satou et al. [
 <xref rid="B118-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>], mice were administered 
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> EO (EORO) by inhalation and it was concluded that the rate of spontaneous alternation activity was significantly improved. The key components (1,8-cineole, α-pinene and β-pinene) were detected in the brain in a concentration-dependent manner upon EORO inhalation, which indicated its possible exerted effects. However, in several other interpretations, it was proposed that 1,8-cineole might require synergistic interaction effects. This was highlighted by Costa et al. [
 <xref rid="B150-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>], where α-pinene and 1,8-cineole from 
 <italic>Lavandula pedunculata</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>Lusitanica</italic> were shown to be effective cholinesterase inhibitors even at low concentrations and are likely to contribute to this behaviour. The synergistic and antagonistic interactions between certain terpenes that could result in combined effects should also be taken into consideration. Although this compound was also mentioned in a study conducted by Hritcu et al. [
 <xref rid="B112-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>], the study focused more on the positive effect of linalool in the improvement of spatial memory deficit in a scopolamine-induced dementia rat model instead of the 1,8-cineole effect on neurodegeneration. In addition, a study by Kaufmann and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B104-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>] signified the potential of myrtenal as an effective AChE inhibitor, compared to 1,8-cineole with EOs of 
 <italic>Artemisia annua L.</italic> (Asteraceae) or 
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra L.</italic> (Fabaceae).
