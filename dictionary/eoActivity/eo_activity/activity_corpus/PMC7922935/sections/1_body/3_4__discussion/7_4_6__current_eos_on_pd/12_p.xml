<p>Compared to individual studies, there are also several approaches that examine combined effects that could incorporate in vitro, in vivo, and also ex vivo applications. One such attractive research is on the combined in vitro/in vivo evaluation of SHXW EO with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mice and SH-SY5Y cell lines [

In this study, SHXW was a Chinese herbal formulation that consisted of 15 crude herbs called KSOP1009, composed of eight medicinal plants of different families (Hamamelidaceae, Myristicaceae, Umbelliferae, Santalaceae, Piperaceae, Myrtaceae, Typhaceae, and Lamiaceae). MPTP is known to cause fast degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, and as such, it was believed that the use of this specific model could assist in explaining certain aspects of PD disease mechanisms [

Positive findings of the study demonstrated that ingestion of KSOP1009 was successful in the protection of MPTP toxicity, where this could be correlated with dopamine reduction that also decreases ROS and restores mitochondrial roles [
