<p>Based on 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-01107-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, a total of sixty-nine types of EOs from different genera of plants were evaluated for their effectiveness against neurodegenerative diseases among studies conducted between 2010 and 2020. In reference to all the compiled literature, we observed that the IC
 <sub>50</sub> results were presented in several formats, in particular to the units of measurement. Among the units that were reported included mg gallic acid equivalents/g [
