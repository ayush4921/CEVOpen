<p>Among all the 15 oils tested, it was shown that 
 <italic>M. communis</italic> demonstrated potential benefits because it elevated the fibrillation in a concentration-dependent manner. However, it is necessary to understand that the major components of this oil are not responsible for the observed changes, suggesting complexity of both extract and synergistic effects of the available compounds, regardless of their amount [

 <italic>C. cyminum</italic> EO signified the presence of cuminaldehyde as the major active compound that plays its role in the inhibition of α-Syn fibrillation. In addition, cytotoxicity assays on PC12 cells indicated the absence of toxic effects with cuminaldehyde treatment throughout α-Syn fibrillation [
