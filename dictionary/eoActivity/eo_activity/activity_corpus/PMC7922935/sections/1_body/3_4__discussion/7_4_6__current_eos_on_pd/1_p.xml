<p>In terms of PD, the current therapy in practice is applied as a combination of gold-standard dopaminergic reposition with 3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-
 <sc>l</sc>-alanine (
 <sc>l</sc>-dopa), along with other agents such as MAO-B, catechol 
 <italic>O</italic>-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors, dopaminergic agonists, and cholinergic blockers [
 <xref rid="B222-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">222</xref>]. However, the available treatments are subject to consequences of motor and non-motor side effects, which leads to poor efficacy in advanced stages of PD [
 <xref rid="B144-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. These arising phenomena are the main reasons that suggest and emphasise the necessity for the synthesis of anti-PD drugs that could delay the progression of neurodegeneration [
 <xref rid="B144-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. As mentioned in the results, PD studies included in this review comprise in vitro and in vivo, as well as combinations of in vitro with in vivo or ex vivo research.
