<p>Four of the included studies on PD were based on in vitro approaches, with various EOs. The first study was focused on the evaluation of protective effects of EOs extracted from 
 <italic>Cinnamomum</italic> sp. (
 <italic>C. verum</italic> and 
 <italic>C. cassia</italic>) and cinnamaldehyde, in comparison to hydroalcoholic extracts using 6-OHDA-induced PC12 cytotoxicity as the representative model of PD [

 <italic>Cinnamomum</italic> sp., or more commonly known as cinnamon, belongs to the Lauraceae family that is composed of almost 250 species and has been acknowledged for extensive health benefits [

 <italic>C. verum</italic> and 
 <italic>C. cassia</italic> were the two main species that have been widely applied for their medicinal and culinary applications, especially in Iran [

 <xref rid="B227-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">227</xref>]. It is important to note that cinnamaldehyde represents one of the key components of both species, and EOs were reported to exhibit strong antioxidant properties [
 <xref rid="B223-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">223</xref>]. The findings of this study indicated that 6-OHDA led to cell death, cell apoptosis, and suppression of the p44/42 pathway. On the whole, the study concluded that synergistic effects of cinnamaldehyde and EOs as well as other extract components could promote cinnamonâ€™s roles as neuroprotective agents, specifically for PD treatment [
