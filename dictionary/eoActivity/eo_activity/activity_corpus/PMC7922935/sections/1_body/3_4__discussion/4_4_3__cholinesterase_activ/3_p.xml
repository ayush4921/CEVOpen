<p>Generally, traditional Ellman assay is used with some modifications, applied for the determination of anti-cholinesterase activities [

 <xref rid="B186-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">186</xref>]. This technique is a simple, accurate, and rapid method of measuring ChE activity, that is based on the reaction between thiocholine with the sulfhydryl group of a chromogen such as 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB or Ellman’s reagent). The shift of electrons to sulphur atoms yields a yellow substance called 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid (TNB), which is measured by monitoring absorbance at 410 nm [

 <xref rid="B190-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>]. DTNB is a water-soluble compound and is useful for its fast reaction with thiocholine and minor side effects at neutral pH [

 <xref rid="B191-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">191</xref>]. This technique, however, is also subject to certain limitations; it is restricted for testing antidots against organophosphorus AChE inhibitors or for measuring AChE activity in samples of such treated individuals [
