<p>Another study that also applies the use of 6-OHDA-induced PD mouse models focused on the investigation of the effects of zingerone and eugenol on dopamine concentration, behavioural changes, and antioxidant activities upon 6-OHDA administration and treatment of

Zingerone is extracted from the ginger root, while eugenol originates from cloves and was reported to be protective against 6-OHDA-induced depletion of striatal dopamine via increases in SOD activity and elevation of reduced glutathione (GSH) and L-Ascorbate (Asc) concentration, respectively [

Although these groups of researchers previously reported positive findings where pre-treatment with zingerone or eugenol inhibited 6-OHDA-induced dopamine depression by preventing lipid peroxidation, the current study, which involved post-treatment with similar compounds, resulted in contradictory findings, where dopamine decrease was more pronounced [
