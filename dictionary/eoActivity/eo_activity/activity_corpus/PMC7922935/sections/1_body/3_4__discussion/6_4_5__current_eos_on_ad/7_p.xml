<p>Meanwhile, 
 <italic>Citrus limon</italic> has been found to significantly lower AChE brain depression in APP/PS1 and wild-type C57BL/6L (WT) mice. PSD95/synaptophysin, the synaptic density index, was substantially improved in histopathological shifts [

 <italic>C. depressa</italic>, 
 <italic>C. reticulata</italic>, 
 <italic>C. sinensis</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. limon</italic> [

 <xref rid="B215-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">215</xref>]. Thus, nobiletin may potentially be the compound that substantially alters the development of these diseases. Other than that, 
 <italic>Acori graminei</italic>, which was found to be rich in β-asarone, enhanced cognitive function of AβPP/PS1 mice and decreased neuronal apoptosis in the AβPP/PS1 mouse cortex. In addition, a substantial increase in the expression of CaMKII/CREB/Bcl-2 was observed in the cortex of AβPP/PS1 mice treated with β-asarone.
