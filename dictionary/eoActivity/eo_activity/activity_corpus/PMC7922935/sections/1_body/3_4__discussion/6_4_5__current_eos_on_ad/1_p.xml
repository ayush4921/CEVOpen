 <italic>Salvia</italic> is the largest genus of plants in the family Lamiaceae, with the number of species estimated to range from 700 to nearly 1000. Fifteen species of 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> (namely, 
 <italic>officinalis</italic> L., 
 <italic>chionantha</italic>, 
 <italic>chrysophylla Staph</italic>, 
 <italic>urmiensis</italic>, 
 <italic>nemorosa</italic> L., 
 <italic>syriaca</italic>, 
 <italic>ballsiana</italic>, 
 <italic>cyanescens</italic>, 
 <italic>divaricate</italic>, 
 <italic>hydrangea</italic>, 
 <italic>kronenburgii</italic>, 
 <italic>macrochlamys</italic>, 
 <italic>nydeggeri</italic>, 
 <italic>pachystachys</italic>, 
 <italic>pseudeuphratica</italic>, and 
 <italic>rusellii</italic>) were studied for cholinesterase inhibition assay, and happen to be the most widely studied source of EOs. Most of the researchers found that 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> spp. were weak AChE and BChE inhibitors, except for EO from 
 <italic>S. pseudeuphratica</italic>, which demonstrated the highest inhibitory activity against AChE, at IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 26.00 ± 2.00 μg/mL compared to 
 <italic>S. cyanescens</italic> and 
 <italic>S. pachystachys</italic>. In contrast, BChE activity did not show 50% inhibition even at the highest concentration, where IC
 <sub>50</sub> was reported to be above 80 μg/mL for 
 <italic>S. pseudeuphratica</italic> and 
 <italic>S. hydrangea</italic> [

 <italic>Salvia officinalis</italic> was studied twice, in 2017 and 2019. Based on GC–MS and GC–FID analysis, the main components of 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> were α-thujone, camphor, 1,8-cineole, and β-thujone. 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> has also been used in ex vivo-based research, using the isolated guinea pig ileum method where the major molecule, rosmarinic acid, showed significant contraction responses on an isolated guinea pig ileum. Docking results of rosmarinic acid also showed a high affinity to the selected target, AChE [
