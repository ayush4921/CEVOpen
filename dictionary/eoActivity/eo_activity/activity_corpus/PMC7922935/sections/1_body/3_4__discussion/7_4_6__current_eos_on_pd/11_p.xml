<p>Rotenone administration to rats, as induction of a PD model, is an alternative approach where it induces nigrostriatal dopaminergic neuron degeneration that is associated with α-Syn Lewy bodies [

 <italic>P. undulata</italic> belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is commonly distributed in Asia, Europe, and North Africa [
 <xref rid="B263-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">263</xref>]. From this study, it was shown that EO of 
 <italic>P. undulata</italic> could exert its neuroprotective effects via anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The mechanisms involved in neuroinflammation suppression include downregulation of induced nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression, followed by lower gene expression of α-Syn [
