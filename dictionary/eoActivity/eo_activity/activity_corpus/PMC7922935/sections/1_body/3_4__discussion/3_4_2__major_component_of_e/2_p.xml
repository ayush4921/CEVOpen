<p>In another study performed by Cutillas and his team [

 <italic>Thymus mastichina L</italic>., it was asserted that among all four compounds (α-pinene, β-pinene, limonene and 1,8-cineole), 1,8-cineole was the best AChE inhibitor with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 35.2 ± 1.5 μg/mL. They tested the antioxidant activity using five different methods such as the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay, the 2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) antioxidant method, the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) method, the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) method, and the chelating power (ChP) method. All the methods recorded that 1,8-cineole was one of the compounds highest in antioxidant capacity. This finding was similar to several other types of research, which suggested the efficacy of 1,8-cineole as the dominant anticholinesterase agent from EOs of different sources [
