<p>In terms of in vivo and ex vivo combinatorial approaches, two articles were highlighted in this review, with several authors originating from the same team [
 <xref rid="B148-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>,
 <xref rid="B149-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>]. Both studies explored the approach of L-dopa induction of oxidative toxicity. 
 <sc>l</sc>-dopa has been recognised as the most effective symptomatic treatment of PD for more than 30 years; however, toxicity issues that were raised via in vitro studies seem to be an unresolved challenge [
 <xref rid="B148-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. It was also mentioned that prolonged L-dopa treatment is often associated with side effects that often result in a delay in its administration [
 <xref rid="B148-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. Past studies have claimed that 
 <sc>l</sc>-dopa therapy in combination with antioxidants could lessen the possible side effects. As such, efforts were taken to evaluate the effects; this research team investigated the combined effects of EOs from 
 <italic>Lavandula angustifolia</italic>, 
 <italic>Rosa damascena</italic>, vitamin C and Trolox in the initial study [
 <xref rid="B148-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>], followed by another study in 2019 on the combined effects of pre-treatment with 
 <italic>Rosa damascena</italic> and vitamin C [
 <xref rid="B149-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>].
