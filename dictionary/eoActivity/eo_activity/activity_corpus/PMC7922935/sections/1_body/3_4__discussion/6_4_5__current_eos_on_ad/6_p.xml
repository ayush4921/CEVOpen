 <italic>Cinnamomum zeylanicum</italic> consisting of (
 <italic>E</italic>)-cinnamaldehyde (CAL) (81.39%) and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-cinnamyl acetate (CAS) (4.20%) as the main compounds showed over 78.0% inhibitory activity in cholinesterase. In MAO-A and MAO-B inhibition assays, EOs from 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> (96.44%, 95.96%) and CAL (96.32%, 96.29%) demonstrated comparable activity to rasagiline (97.42%, 97.38%, respectively). Research by Murata and co-workers [
 <xref rid="B69-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] found that kaur-16-ene, nezukol, and ferruginol isolated from plants had anti-AChE (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) activity at 640, 300 and 95 Î¼m, respectively. Even though ferruginol activity has already been highlighted before, by Gulacti et al. [
 <xref rid="B213-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">213</xref>], this study documented the activities of kaur-16-ene and nezukol for the first time.
