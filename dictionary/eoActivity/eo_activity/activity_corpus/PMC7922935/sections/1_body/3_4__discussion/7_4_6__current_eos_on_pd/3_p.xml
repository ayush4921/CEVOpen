 <italic>Eryngium</italic> sp. belong to the Apiaceae family, and are recognised for their EOs’ potentials in MAO inhibition [
 <xref rid="B139-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. MAO is available in two forms (A, B) where MAO-A inhibition is linked to antidepressant effects, while MAO-B is correlated with PD treatment [

 <xref rid="B229-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">229</xref>]. An in vitro study conducted by Klein-Júnior et al. demonstrated the assessment of 
 <italic>Eryngium</italic> sp. (
 <italic>E. floribundum</italic>: 
 <italic>EP</italic>, 
 <italic>E. horridum</italic>: 
 <italic>EH</italic>,

 <italic>EP</italic>, 
 <italic>E. eriophorum</italic>: 
 <italic>EE</italic> and 
 <italic>E. nudicaule</italic>: 
 <italic>EN</italic>) EOs for their MAO inhibitory effect. Intriguingly, the findings of this study indicated that MAO-A activity was not inhibited by any EOs, while EPEO and EHEO resulted in MAO-B inhibition. The literature search has also highlighted that PD patients usually represent elevated levels of MAO-B which arise due to gliosis, and hence contribute towards the collapse of the dopaminergic system [

 <italic>Eryngium</italic> sp. could have potential applications as CNS bioactive secondary metabolites, particularly for neurodegenerative disease, in relevance to characteristics exhibited by EHEO [
