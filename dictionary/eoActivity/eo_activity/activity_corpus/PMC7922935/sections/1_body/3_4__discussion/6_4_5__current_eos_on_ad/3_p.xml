<p>Only two types of cell lines, SH-SY5Y and PC-12, were reported to have been used in AD research. The in vitro toxic effects of amyloid peptides are usually examined using the human neuroblastoma-derived SH-SY5Y cell line, because differentiated neuron-like SH-SY5Y cells are extra-sensitive to amyloid peptides compared to non-differentiated cells, because the latter lack long neurites [

 <italic>Z</italic>-ligustilide (Z-LIG) EOs effectively protect against fibrillar aggregates of Aβ25–35- and Aβ1–42-induced toxicity in SH-SY5Y and differentiated PC12 cells, possibly through the concurrent activation of the PI3-K/Akt pathway and inhibition of the p38 pathway [
