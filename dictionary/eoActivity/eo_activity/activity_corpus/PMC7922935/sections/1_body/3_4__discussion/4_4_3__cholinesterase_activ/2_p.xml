<p>Both AChE and BChE possess active sites at the bottom of 20 Ã…-deep gorges with 50% identical amino acid sequence, whereas the gorge entrance locates the peripheral site [
 <xref rid="B179-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">179</xref>]. The active site for both enzymes comprises a catalytic triad, acyl-binding pocket, and choline binding site [
 <xref rid="B180-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">180</xref>]. A total of 14 aromatic amino acids are found in the active site of AChE, whereas six of these are substituted by aliphatic amino acids for BChE [
 <xref rid="B181-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">181</xref>]. Binding and hydrolysis processes of bulky ligands are restricted in AChE due to presence of phenylalanine residues in the acyl binding pocket. In contrast, these residues are substituted with two flexible amino acids that are selective for BChE and allow the binding of bulkier ligands [
 <xref rid="B182-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">182</xref>]. The different mechanisms involved in relevance to the active gorge site specific for each enzymes have been investigated via molecular modelling, structure-based virtual screening, or even crystallographic studies [
