<p>Su He Xiang Wan (SHXW) has also been studied for its neurodegenerative remedy potential. SHXW is a distinct EO, and is a patent medicine comprising borneol, styrax resin, musk, aquilaria, frankincense, piper, benzoin, saussurea, cyperus, sandalwood, clove, terminallia, aristolachia fruit, rhino horn, and cinnabar. This ancient prescription was recorded in the

For this plant, the researchers evaluated the effects of a modified SHXW (KSOP1009 formulation) intake on the AD-like phenotypes of Drosophila AD models, which express human Aβ1–42 in their developing eyes or neurons. They found that Aβ1–42-induced eye degeneration, apoptosis, and locomotive dysfunctions were strongly suppressed. However, Aβ1–42 fibril deposits in the Aβ1–42 overexpressing model were not affected by treatment with KSOP1009 extract. Conversely, KSOP1009 extract intake significantly suppressed the constitutive active form of hemipterous, a c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activator, while it induced eye degeneration and JNK activation. In Drosophila, flies with mutations that augment JNK signalling accumulate less oxidative damage and live dramatically longer than wild-type flies [
