<p>Apart from in vitro studies, PD studies are also extensively performed under in vivo conditions. EOs of 
 <italic>Acorus</italic> sp. cover two of the in vivo studies in this review. Both of these studies were conducted by the same research team, and focused on the regulation effect of β-asarone that was isolated from 
 <italic>A. tatarinowii Schott</italic> on 6-OHDA-induced parkinsonian rats via two distinct endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathways [
