<p>For the first study, the obtained results indicated that both EOs from herbal plants showed noticeable radical scavenging and antioxidant properties against 
 <sc>l</sc>-dopa toxicity. Similarly, the second study also put forward equivalent claims with 
 <italic>R. damascena</italic> characteristics where it was in parallel to vitamin C, and exhibited a significant role of rose oil in its interference against the acute oxidative toxicity of 
 <sc>l</sc>-dopa [

 <xref rid="B149-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>]. Based on all the collective studies, it could be observed that PD treatments remain centralised among several parameters that include mainly α-Syn fibrillation, MAO-B, β-asarone regulation of ER stress pathways, toxicity-induced models with 6-OHDA, MPTP, 
 <sc>l</sc>-dopa, reserpine, and rotenone with common animal models of rats and mice. Although the regulation mechanisms involved in each of the parameters may differ, the main focus remains towards effective and improved treatments for PD patients.
