<p>The chemical structures of several major components commonly found in EOs that have been reported to have anti-neurodegenerative properties are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-01107-f003">Figure 3</xref>. Based on our review, 1,8-cineole has been identified as one of the major components found from various types of EOs. The compound 1,8-cineole is a saturated monoterpene that can originate from several plant species (e.g., 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic>, 
 <italic>Rosmarinus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Salvia</italic>), with 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> leaves recognised as the key source [
 <xref rid="B159-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>]. Sometimes called eucalyptol due to its natural source, 1,8-cineole should not be confused with eucalyptus oil, a combination of many other components [
 <xref rid="B160-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>]. Due to its excellent aroma and taste, 1,8-cineole is mostly used in fruit, fragrances, and cosmetics. Furthermore, pure monoterpene 1,8-cineole is used as an alternative sinusitis remedy for respiratory tract infections, such as common cold or bronchitis [
 <xref rid="B161-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>]. It was indicated as one of the most potent free radical scavengers that may influence anticholinesterase activity based on a study reported by El Euch and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B88-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] The antioxidant activity was measured using the free radical 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) test. Essential oil concentration providing 50% inhibition (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) of the initial DPPH concentration was calculated using the linear relationship between the compound concentration and the percentage of DPPH inhibition. Ascorbic acid was used as a standard. In the study by Abuhamdah et al. [
 <xref rid="B66-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], EO extracted from the leaves of 
 <italic>Aloysia citrodora Palau</italic> showed neuroprotective activity and a higher presence of 1,8-cineole was reported (23.66%).
