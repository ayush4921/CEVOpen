<p>Another study also applied induction with reserpine, with a different PD model of ovariectomized and non-ovariectomized rats [
 <xref rid="B145-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>]. Reserpine is known as an irreversible inhibitor of the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT-2). The approach of reserpine injection to rats as a mode of PD model was proposed in response to its action on the depletion of monoamine and locomotor activities [

 <xref rid="B255-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">255</xref>]. Lower oestrogen levels are correlated with many side effects, such as mental disorders, memory defects, emotional issues, and other cognitive failures [

 <xref rid="B259-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">259</xref>]. The evaluation of this study indicated that protective oestrogen effects against neurodegenerative disorders were significantly decreased among reserpine-induced ovariectomized rats. Injection of reserpine resulted in a more remarkable observation on limb movement disorder among ovariectomized rats. Fennel treatment at various doses for both groups gave better results on the motor activity, which stressed the importance of oestrogens and phytoestrogens as a protective measure of dopaminergic neurons and improved PD symptoms [
