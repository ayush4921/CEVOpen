<p>It is not only humans which have amyloid beta; non-human primates (NHPs) have the same AÎ² sequences as humans, an almost identical APP sequence, and they overlap with related human biochemical pathways in many aspects, however surprisingly with ageing, they develop relatively few AD-like neuropathologies. Aged canines also develop severe amyloid deposition; canines tend to demonstrate extensive amyloid deposition from about ten years of age, unlike in aged NHPs, where it could take several decades [

 <xref rid="B200-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">200</xref>]. The resurgence of interest in rats as the appropriate animal model of AD led to the usage of various types of rat models. As of current practice, transgenic mice have been extensively used in studies on AD. In any selected models, all need the introduction of some combined familial AD mutation into APP or PS1, or even in both [
