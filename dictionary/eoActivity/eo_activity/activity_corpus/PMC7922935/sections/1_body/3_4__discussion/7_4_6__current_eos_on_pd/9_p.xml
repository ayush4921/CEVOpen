<p>In addition to studies among 6-OHDA-induced Parkinson’s rat models, the possibility to achieve positive effects of EOs when complexed with β-cyclodextrin (βCD) was evaluated by Filho and colleagues using reserpine-induced progressive models for PD in mice [

Cyclodextrins are cyclic oligosaccharides that could form host–guest complexes with hydrophobic molecules and were also reported to protect EOs from heat, evaporation, moisture, oxidation and light effects along with facilitating easy solubility [

 <xref rid="B249-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">249</xref>]. Complexation effects of cyclodextrins with EOs were shown to be more prominent in exerting positive effects, especially in the treatment of chronic diseases, as published by several studies [

 <xref rid="B251-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">251</xref>]. In this particular study, the same approach was applied using leaf EO extracted from 
 <italic>Eplingiella fruticosa</italic> (EPL), where one of the key components is 1,8-cineole. 
 <italic>Eplingiella</italic> sp. belongs to the Lamiaceae family, and was reported for its benefits as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects [

 <xref rid="B253-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">253</xref>]. This research demonstrated and proved the hypothesis whereby both treated groups of EPL and EPL-βCD deferred reserpine effects on catalepsy time. However, this effect was noticed to be more remarkable with EPL-βCD treated mice groups.
