<p>Another important aspect that is usually associated with studies on PD is on α-Syn fibrillation. It is presumed that protein structural modifications resulting in amyloid fibril formation progresses towards neurodegenerative disorders [

In addition, it should also be noted that preventive measures against α-Syn fibrillation are yet to be available; hence, the acceleration of the fibrillation process via certain factors should be avoided. Among some of the common factors are metal ions, small molecules, nanoparticles, and, particularly, toxins that could intensify the aggregation process [
