<p>Our review findings also revealed that several studies did not specify the studied disease, and instead examined general neurodegenerative disorders. The in vitro study conducted by Costa et al. [

 <italic>Pelargonium graveolens</italic> inhibited nitric oxide (NO) production, as well as the expression of the proinflammatory enzymes cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and induced nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in primary cultures of activated microglial cells. The finding showed that none of the major constituents could inhibit NO production when examined at natural relative oil concentrations, with excellent inhibitory activity of citronellol at higher concentrations. The findings indicated that the presence of synergistic interactions between these components are of considerable importance. Thus, geranium oil can be useful in neurodegenerative disease prevention where neuroinflammation is part of pathophysiology [
