<p>In general, GRP78 functions in the regulation of ER stress, where it binds the three proteins of the UPR pathway and maintains them as inactive when the cells are not exposed to stress conditions. However, under conditions of accumulated protein unfolding or misfolding, GRP78 will bind to the proteins and release them [

The pro-autophagic role of Beclin-1 could be inhibited via its reaction with Bcl-2, however this interaction is also subject to disruption caused by Bcl-2 phosphorylation that leads to Beclin-1 release and accelerates autophagy [
 <xref rid="B244-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">244</xref>]. As per the second pathway study, it was proven that β-asarone leads to Beclin-1 downregulation, which highlights that Bcl-2 could possibly be the main linkage between autophagy and ER stress. The findings of both studies lead us to conclude that diminishing ER stress via β-asarone regulation is proven to be useful in the impairment of PD pathological progression [
