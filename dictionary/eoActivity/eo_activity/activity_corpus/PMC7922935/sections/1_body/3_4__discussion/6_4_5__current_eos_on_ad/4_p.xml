<p>There was also a study on the potential therapeutic effect of hybrid EO from Kushui roses. Kushui rose (
 <italic>R. setate × R. rugosa</italic>) refers to a natural hybrid of cog rose and traditional Chinese rose that has been cultivated for more than 200 years [

In this study, transgenic worm strains purchased from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (CGC) were used instead of rat or mice models. They found that rose EO (REO) significantly inhibited AD-like symptoms of worm paralysis and hypersensitivity to exogenous serotonin (5-HT) in a dose-dependent manner. Although the GC–MS analysis revealed the presence of 40 components, the major components, β-citronellol and geraniol, were found to act less effectively than the oil itself. Intriguingly, REO significantly suppressed Aβ deposits and reduced the Aβ oligomers to alleviate the toxicity induced by Aβ overexpression [
