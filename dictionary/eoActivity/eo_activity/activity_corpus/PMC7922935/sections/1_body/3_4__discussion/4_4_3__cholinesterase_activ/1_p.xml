<p>The most common criteria used in the determination of AD is related to anti-cholinesterase activity. Cholinesterases (ChEs) are specialised carboxylic ester hydrolases that catalyse the hydrolysis of choline esters. Two types of ChE activity have been identified in mammalian blood and tissues, which are distinguished according to their substrate specificity and sensitivity to selective inhibitors. The first is acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which is systematically known as acetylcholine acetylhydrolase [

 <xref rid="B176-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">176</xref>]. The preferred substrate for AChE is acetylcholine (ACh), while butyrylcholine (BCh) and propionylcholine (PCh) are ideal for BChE [

 <xref rid="B177-molecules-26-01107" ref-type="bibr">177</xref>]. AChE activity is known to be inhibited by several compounds, with toxins and drugs as the major inhibitors [
