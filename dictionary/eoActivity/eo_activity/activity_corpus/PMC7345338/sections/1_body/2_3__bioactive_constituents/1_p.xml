 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> contains many phytochemical compounds namely, lactones, terpenoids (e.g., 
 <italic>trans</italic>-thujone, Î³-terpinene, 1,4-terpeniol, myrcene, bornyl acetate, cadinene camphene, 
 <italic>trans</italic>-sabinyl acetate, guaiazulene, chamazulene, camphor, and linalool), essential oils, organic acids, resins, tannins, and phenols [

 <italic>O</italic>-rhamnose glucoside, isoquercitrin, quercitin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-D-glucoside, quercetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-rhamnoglucoside, and isorhamnetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside, and phenolic acids (coumaric, syringic, salicylic, chlorogenic, and vanillic acids) which contribute to free radical scavenging mechanism [

 <xref rid="B11-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] reported that methanolic 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> extract contains isoflavone glycosides that are characterized as 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> isoflavonyl glucosyl diester and bis-isoflavonyl dirhamnoside. Previous studies documented that 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> essential oils are rich in myrcene, 
 <italic>trans</italic>-thujone, 
 <italic>cis</italic>-epoxyocimene, 
 <italic>cis</italic>-chrysanthenyl acetate, and 
 <italic>trans</italic>-sabinyl acetate are the most common compounds found in [
