<p>Combination chemotherapies are now documented to relieve severe diseases, including malignancies, immune deficiency syndrome, lung tuberculosis, and several protozoa to facilitate improved therapeutic efficacy [

 <xref rid="B152-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]. Notably, Batiha et al. [
 <xref rid="B2-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] reported that the combined application of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> extract with diminazine aceturate and atovaquone showed additive and synergetic effects against 
 <italic>Babesia</italic> and 
 <italic>Theileria</italic> parasites in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, World Health Organization (WHO) recommends artemisinin as well as artemether as a combination therapy with a generic antimalarial drug (lumefantrine) as the first-line antimalarial treatment in more than 50 countries suffering from chloroquine-resistant malaria [

In addition to that, artesunate/pyronaridine, artesunate/amodiaquine, dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine, artesunate/mefloquine, and artesunate/sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine combination therapies have recently been approved for the treatment of artemisinin-resistant malaria [
