<p>Reports have shown that 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> displayed antifungal action and this could be linked to their essential oil. The antifungal action shown by essential oils present in 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> makes the plant an essential natural product in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and food industries. Juteau et al. [
 <xref rid="B96-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>] reported that Croatian 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> essential oil belongs to (
 <italic>Z</italic>)-epoxyocimene and β-thujone chemotype, while French 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> essential oil belongs to (
 <italic>Z</italic>)-epoxyocimene and chrysanthenyl acetate chemotype. The Croatian chemotype exhibited higher fungicidal effect against 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> var. 
 <italic>chevalieri</italic> than the French one that is free from thujone, suggesting the significant role of thujones in the antimicrobial effect of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> essential oil. Moreover, Msaada et al. [
 <xref rid="B123-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>] revealed that Uruguay 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> essential oil was rich in thujone and exhibited antifungal effects against 
 <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> and 
 <italic>Alternaria</italic> sp., while Turkish 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> essential oil contains camphor, 1,8-cineole, and chamazulene as main components and showed fungicidal effect against 34 species of fungi such as 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> and 
 <italic>F. solani</italic>. Another study documented that 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> essential oil exhibited potent antifungal effect on 
 <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic>, 
 <italic>A. niger</italic>, 
 <italic>Epidermophyton floccosum</italic>, 
 <italic>Trichophyton mentagrophytes</italic>, 
 <italic>Microsporum canis</italic>, 
 <italic>Candida neoformans</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> with significant increase in inhibition zones with zone diameter range of 13–25 mm. and MIC was 50–100 µg/mL [
 <xref rid="B124-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. Whereas another study by Joshi et al. [
 <xref rid="B125-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>] stated that 
 <italic>Micrococcus luteus</italic> was more susceptible to 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> essential oil with an MIC value of 25  ±  4 µg/mL, followed by 
 <italic>M. flavus</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic>Penicillium chrysogenum</italic> and 
 <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> with MIC values of 58  ±  8, 65  ±  8, 84  ±  15, and 91  ±  13 µg/mL, respectively. Consistently, essential oils obtained from 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> displayed inhibitory action on three phytopathogenic fungi (
 <italic>F. culmorum</italic>, 
 <italic>F. graminearum</italic>, and 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B123-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. Recently, 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic>-silver nanoparticles (
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic>-Ag NPs) nanoparticles have been characterized for its fungicidal activity against three pathogenic yeasts of the 
 <italic>Candida</italic> genus. They yielded lower MIC and MFC values than those shown by Ag NPs, indicating that the bioactive compounds found in 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> synergistically increased the antifungal activity of Ag NPs [
