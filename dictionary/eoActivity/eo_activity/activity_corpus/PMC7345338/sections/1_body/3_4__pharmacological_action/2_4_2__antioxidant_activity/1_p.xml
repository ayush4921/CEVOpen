<p>The free radical scavenging and antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> has been reported by Ali et al. [
 <xref rid="B7-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. They documented that this activity is attributed to the presence of several phenolic compounds (gallic acid, coumaric acid, vanillic acid, syringic acid, chlorogenic salicylic acid) and flavonoids including quercetin and rutin. Recently, Bora et al. [
 <xref rid="B38-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] revealed that 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> possesses potent antioxidant properties and its methanolic extract has clearly demonstrated neuroprotection evidenced by the reduction of lipid peroxidation level associated with decreasing thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) level and the recovery of endogenous antioxidant (e.g., superoxide dismutase (SOD) glutathione (GSH)), indicating that 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> may be used as a preventive agent against diseases related to oxidative stress. Another study evidenced the free radical scavenging action and cytoprotective effect of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> ethanolic extract against oxidative injury in fibroblast-like cells [
 <xref rid="B39-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The plant extracts were tested for free radical scavenging action by estimating their capacity to inhibits 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) free radical and reactive hydroxyl radical during the Fenton reaction trapped by 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-
 <italic>N</italic>-oxide through the use of electron spin resonance spectroscopy [
 <xref rid="B24-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Thus, 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> was recognized to be a vital source of natural antioxidant substances.
