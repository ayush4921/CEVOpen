 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> was reported to display an antipyretic action, Khattak et al. [
 <xref rid="B79-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] showed that chloroform, hexane, and aqueous 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> extracts have antipyretic action compared to the action displayed by aspirin in subcutaneous yeast inoculations in experimental rabbits. Additionally, no adverse effect was observed after 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> treatment up to dose of 1.6 g/kg. In another work, 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> ethanol extract containing 24-Î²-ethyl 
 <italic>p</italic>-cholesta-7, 22-dien-3 Bat, demonstrated antipyretic action in rats with less side effect [
 <xref rid="B80-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Zeraati et al. [
 <xref rid="B81-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>] revealed that 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> extracts demonstrate a topical antinociceptive action in experimental mice. Additionally, the topical application of an ointment containing the plant ameliorates clinical symptoms from individuals affected by osteoarthritis on the knee [
