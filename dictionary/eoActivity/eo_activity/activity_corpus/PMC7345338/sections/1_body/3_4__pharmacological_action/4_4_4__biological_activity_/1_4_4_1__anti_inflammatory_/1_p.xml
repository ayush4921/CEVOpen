<p>Several reports have shown that 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> and its extracts possess a significant anti-inflammatory action and this action may be attributed to its secondary metabolites including flavonoids and sesquiterpene type compounds [

 <xref rid="B72-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. These compounds exhibit their anti-inflammatory activity through inhibition of inflammatory regulators such as bradykinins, histamine, prostaglandins, and serotonin. Moreover, Ahmad et al. [
 <xref rid="B73-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] revealed that methanolic 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> extract resulted in different level of anti-inflammatory activity when administered at 300, 500, and 1000 mg/kg concentrations. Moreover, methanolic 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> extract displayed a delayed anti-inflammatory response which may be caused by the plant extracts’ delayed absorption. Nalbantsoy et al. [
 <xref rid="B74-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] investigated the inhibitory activity of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> methanolic extract on carrageenan-induced acute inflammation in rats. They observed that methanol extract of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> ameliorated the inflammation caused by snake venom. In addition, Lee et al. [
 <xref rid="B75-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] documented the in vitro and in vivo anti-inflammatory effect of 5,6,3′,5′-tetramethoxy 7,4′-hydroxyflavone obtained from 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic>. They reported that 5,6,3′,5′-tetramethoxy 7,4′-hydroxyflavone have anti-inflammatory action by suppressing the expression of proinflammatory mediators such as inducible NO synthase (iNOS), prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), nitric oxide (NO), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB) in RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). It also inhibited the tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) serum level in collagen-treated mice. Consistently, cardomonin obtained from 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> extracts displayed inhibited both NO release and iNOS expression by its direct effect on transcription factor binding to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). [

 <xref rid="B52-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] also showed that natural sesquiterpene dimer, caruifolin D found in 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> showed high anti-neuroinflammatory action and proposed to be serve as a lead for the development of drugs for treating neuro-inflammation-related disorders. Choi et al. [
 <xref rid="B77-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] showed that flavone isolated from 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> inhibited interleukin-10 (IL-10) synthesis and displayed anti-inflammatory actions on cytokine, hence reducing arthritis induced by collagen in experimental mice [
