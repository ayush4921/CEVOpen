<p>Renal disorder is one of the most prevalent and chronic diseases associated with diabetes, which changes the level of amino acid products [

 <xref rid="B64-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. A remarkable reduction in the serum protein level was recorded in diabetic rats induced by alloxan. Insulin hormone promotes the uptake of amino acid, stimulates the production of protein, and prevents the protein breakdown [
 <xref rid="B65-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The blood level of creatinine and urea serve as a biomarker of renal function and are elevated in diabetic experimental rats [
 <xref rid="B66-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Farzaneh et al. [
 <xref rid="B67-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] documented the efficacy of wormwood extract to reduce the destructive effect of azathioprineon on kidney tissues especially on glomerulus, malpighian body, and urine collecting ducts. Moreover. Kharoubi et al. [
 <xref rid="B68-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] stated that aqueous wormwood extract showed antioxidant activity and protect kidney and liver from the toxicity caused by lead by restoring the Na+-K+-ATPase, Ca++-ATPase, and Mg++-ATPase levels to normal. This action may be linked to high contents of total phenolic compounds and total flavonoids as well as antioxidant effect of wormwood extract that contribute in improving renal tissue in rats-treated azathioprine as well as lead-induced oxidative damage in liver and kidney. A recent report documented the ability of different 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> extracts in improving the kidney dysfunction parameters by enhancing serum protein and diminishing the urea and creatinine levels in diabetic rats induced by alloxan administration [
 <xref rid="B69-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Krebs et al. [
 <xref rid="B70-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] proposed that 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> free with thujone can be used as in the management of proteinuria in patients with immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy. Daradka et al. [
 <xref rid="B69-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] reported data about the hypoglycemic activity of different concentrations of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> ethanolic extracts on alloxan-induced diabetic rats. They reported that 500 mg/kg and 1000 mg/kg doses of the extracts resulted in higher hypoglycemic effect than 250 mg/kg. This action maybe because of the presence of natural active compounds which include thujyl alcohol, α- and β-thujones, azulenes, cadinene, bisabolene, sabinene, phellandrene, and pinene, the main compound of this medicinal plant, which also affects insulin-sensitizing properties. It was reported that this compound, thujone, has an effective insulin-sensitizing action as it can elevate insulin-activated glucose transporter by stimulating adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which mainly activated the translocation of insulin-stimulated glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) to the cell surface. Additionally, Hassan et al. [
 <xref rid="B71-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] validated antihyperlipidemic and hypoglycemic action of the plant in type-2 diabetic patients with hyperlipidemia.
