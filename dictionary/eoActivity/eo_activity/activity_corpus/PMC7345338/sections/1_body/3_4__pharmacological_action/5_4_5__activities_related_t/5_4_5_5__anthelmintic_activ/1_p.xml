 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> has been reported as the effective natural product used as a substitute for synthetic agents in the management of diseases in animals and humans caused by parasites. Both α and β form of thujone in volatile oil obtained from 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> have been shown to display actions against helminths [
 <xref rid="B127-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. Comparing with albendazole, a synthetic antihelminthic agent, aqueous and ethanol extracts of aerial parts of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> showed greater activity on gastrointestinal nematodes called 
 <italic>Haemonchus contortus</italic> worms [
 <xref rid="B128-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]. Additionally, Mravčáková et al. [
 <xref rid="B129-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>] showed that 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> aqueous leaf extract was strongly active against 
 <italic>Haemonchus contortus</italic> in sheep. The plant was shown to contain high flavonoids and sesquiterpene lactones, which have been stated to be responsible for the antihelminthic action with a low level of toxicity [
 <xref rid="B130-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. This outcome was in line with other studies revealed that 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> ethanol extract remarkably decreased juvenile (L3) larval motility and development of egg of 
 <italic>Ascaris suum</italic> in an in vitro model [
 <xref rid="B112-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. Consistently, Caner et al. [
 <xref rid="B60-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] showed that treatment with methanol 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> aerial parts extract decreased 
 <italic>Trichinella spiralis</italic> larvae numbers in the muscle, quadriceps, diaphragm, tongue, and biceps-triceps rats muscles. Similarly, essential oils from the plant resulted in about a 66% decrease of adult 
 <italic>T. spiralis</italic> parasites in mice intestine [
