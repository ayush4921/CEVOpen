<p>Bora et al. [
 <xref rid="B48-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] revealed that 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> demonstrated neuroprotective effects on cerebral damage stimulated by reperfusion and may aid in the formation of endogenous antioxidant including glutathione peroxidase and SOD. Additionally, the plant promotes cognitive ability through its nicotinic and muscarinic action [
 <xref rid="B19-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Consistently, 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> ethanol extract has been shown to display anticholinesterase activity and to demonstrate protective mechanisms by preventing lead-induced neurotoxicity; and can alter the ratsâ€™ behaviour by restoring AChE and monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzymes to near normal activity [
 <xref rid="B49-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The plant enhanced neuronal and glial cell alterations triggered by extreme lead poisoning in adult laboratory rats suggested ameliorative activity of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> in the degeneration of mercuric chloride-induced neurons [

 <xref rid="B51-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Besides, the natural sesquiterpene dimer, caruifolin, obtained from 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> L. substantially inhibited the arrangement of intracellular free reactive oxygen molecules, therefore, this mode of action could be linked to its neuroprotective mechanistic action [
 <xref rid="B52-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Mahmoudi et al. [
 <xref rid="B53-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] investigated the anti-depressant activity of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> using forced swimming and tail suspension tests. They revealed that 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> extract had the same anti-depressant efficacy as imipramine in reducing the immobility period. This antidepressant action may be attributed to mechanistic action including inhibition of MAO, abrogation of depression, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibition as well as the possible combination of phytochemical compounds present in extract [
