<p>Shafi et al. [
 <xref rid="B8-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] have studied the antiproliferative effect of methanolic 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> extract on estrogen-unresponsive MDA-MB-231 human breast and an estrogen-responsive MCF-7 cancer cell lines. They showed that 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> stimulated 50% abrogation on the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. They reported that the anticancer mechanisms of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> extract was attributed to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway, which simultaneously activates the mitochondrial pathway of caspase activation, and regulates Bad and Bcl-2 family proteins, resulting in MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 cells apoptotic death [

 <xref rid="B40-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] showed that the aerial parts crude extract of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> abrogates cell proliferation and stimulates programmed cell deaths in carcinoma estrogenic-unresponsive cell line (MDA-MB-231), an estrogenic-responsive cell line (MCF-7) cell line through the mediation of intracellular signaling mode of action [
 <xref rid="B41-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Some studies have shown that chlorogenic acid (5-
 <italic>O</italic>-caffeoylquinic acid) has demonstrated an inhibitory effect on carcinogenesis in the liver, large intestine, and tongue and shown protective effect on in vivo oxidative stress model [
 <xref rid="B42-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Artesunate, an artemisinin derivative, demonstrated in vitro and in vivo antitumor effect [
 <xref rid="B43-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Chlorogenic acid (5-
 <italic>O</italic>-caffeoylquinic acid) isolated from 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> extract displayed an inhibitory effect on carcinogenesis in the liver, large intestine, and tongue, and demonstrated ameliorative effect on oxidative stress in vivo. Another compound (artemisetin) extracted from 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> showed significant antitumor effect against melanoma B16, however, insignificant action was recorded on the growth retardation of Pliss lymph sarcoma [
 <xref rid="B44-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Crespo-Ortiz and Wei. [
 <xref rid="B45-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] assumed that artemisinin bioactivation takes place in the endosome after the release of iron induced by the pH from the internalized transferrin. Iron activated-artemisinin provides carbon-centered radicals that can facilitate the disruption of lysosome and ROS generation leading to mitochondrial injury, caspases activation, and cell death. Other study have also been correlated artemisinin toxicity with cytokinesis reduction, improved the oxidative stress levels, tumor invasion inhibition, migration, and metastasis [
 <xref rid="B46-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Moreover, Parekh et al. [
 <xref rid="B47-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] documented the anticancer activity of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> as well as artesunate and dihydro artesunate against a wide range of cancer cell lines namely, HO-8910 (ovarian cancer), KML-562 (chronic myeloid leukaemia), and HeLa (cervical cancer).
