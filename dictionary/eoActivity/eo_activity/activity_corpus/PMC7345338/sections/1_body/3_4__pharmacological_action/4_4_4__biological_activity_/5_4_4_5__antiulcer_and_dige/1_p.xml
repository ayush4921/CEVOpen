<p>In dyspeptic conditions such as gall bladder disease and gastritis, 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> was reported to exhibit an ameliorative effect [

 <xref rid="B88-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Another study reported that hexane, ethanol, methanol, and chloroform extracts of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> displayed antiulcer properties in ulcerogenic rats induced by acetylsalicylic acid. The plant performed this action by significantly decreasing ulcer index, the gastric juice volume and reducing the activity of peptidase enzyme [

 <xref rid="B89-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>] reported that oral administration of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> ethanolic extract showed antiulcer activity in BALB/C mice by enhancing palatability and thus affecting feed intake. Kim et al. [
 <xref rid="B90-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>] indicated that an 18% increase in the intake of organic matter and dry matter diets containing wormwood extract by sheep was recorded compared to sheep fed on the diet without wormwood. Moreover, Kim et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] reported that the higher intake of animal diets containing silage of wormwood compared to the control diet (without wormwood silage) in sheep, which characterized by a higher concentration of protein, lower fiber and higher rate of digestibility. Moreover, Kreitmair. [
 <xref rid="B91-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>] reported the efficacy of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> extracts or teas for the treatment of gastrointestinal tract disorders due to its content of bitter substances and essential oil. He documented that this action depends mainly on enhancing the bile production and secretion. Clinical studies reported that ethanolic 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> extracts can increase gastric, biliary, and intestinal secretion in humans after oral administration and this effect may be due to its content of essential oil and bitter substances [

 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> and its related compounds are summarized in
