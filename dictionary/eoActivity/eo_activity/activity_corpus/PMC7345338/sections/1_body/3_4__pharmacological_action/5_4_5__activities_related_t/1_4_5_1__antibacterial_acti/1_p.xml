<p>Studies have shown the wide-spectrum inhibitory effect of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> against several microorganisms and this was attributed to its essential oil compositions. 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> ethanol extracts abrogate 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (ATCC 29213) strain with inhibition zones 10–15 mm in diameter, however, not shown antibacterial potential against 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> DM, 
 <italic>Streptococcus faecalis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> var. 
 <italic>niger</italic> ATCC 10 [
 <xref rid="B92-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> extracts demonstrated effective antimicrobial action particularly against Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria [
 <xref rid="B93-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Sengul et al. [
 <xref rid="B94-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>] demonstrated that methanolic 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> extract resulted in inhibitory effect against 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> ATCC 6633, 
 <italic>Salmonella typmiruim</italic> RSSK 95091, 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> 6230, 
 <italic>S. thermophilus</italic> 6453, 
 <italic>Providencia alcalifaciens</italic> 3215, and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic> 1617 higher than those of ofloxacin and novobiocin. Another study showed that the topical application of a hydroalcoholic 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> extract at the site of the infected wound revealed remarkable antibacterial action on 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. The antimicrobial action recorded may be because of synergistic action between the minor (e.g., α-pinene, β-pinene) and major (e.g., camphor, 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, caryophyllene) compounds in 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic>. The mechanism by which 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> employed its antimicrobial activity is attributed to bioactive components (monoterpene hydrocarbons) including α-pinene, caryophyllene, camphor, β-pinene, and 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, as these biomolecules were reported to permeabilize the biological membranes interfere with fluidity of membranes [
 <xref rid="B95-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Juteau et al. [
 <xref rid="B96-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>] stated that the antibacterial action of essential oil extracted from 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> was significantly higher than gentamicin against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (sensitive and resistant strains), 
 <italic>Sal. typhi</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> ATCC 8739, 
 <italic>Proteus vulgaris</italic>, 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> 10031, and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> 9027, and thus, they can be used as a natural preservative in food and pharmaceutical industries. The antibacterial action of the essential oil composition of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> was linked to the presence of α-phellandrene and chamazulene which were the main components of the essential oils [
 <xref rid="B12-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B97-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. Zanousi et al. [
 <xref rid="B98-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>] identified β-Thujone, 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene 1,8-cineole, 
 <italic>cis</italic>-chrysanthenol, sabinene, camphor caryophyllene, and α-phellandrene as major compounds in 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> essential oil. Mihajilov-Krstev et al. [
 <xref rid="B99-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>] documented that the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> essential oil was ranged from &lt;0.08 mg/mL on 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> 25 923 and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> 9027 extracted from wounds and on 
 <italic>Enterobacter aerogenes</italic> and 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> extracted from human stools to 2.43 mg/mL on 
 <italic>Klebsiella oxytoca</italic> isolated from stools, whereas the minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) of the essential oil was ranged from 0.08 mg/ mL on 
 <italic>Kl. oxytoca</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolated from wounds and 
 <italic>E. aerogenes</italic> isolated from stools to 38.80 mg/mL on 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> ATCC 7644. Besides, essential oils from 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> were reported to inhibit 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> with MIC of 0.14, 0.62, and 0.8 μL/mL, respectively and they act by suppressing the biosynthesis of proteins, RNA, DNA, and polysaccharide in the bacterial cells [
 <xref rid="B100-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Recently, Bartkiene et al. [
 <xref rid="B101-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>] investigated the antimicrobial activity of the 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> water extract and essential oil, lactic acid bacteria strain, 
 <italic>Lactobacillus uvarum</italic> LUHS245, and blackcurrants juice preparation BY against 
 <italic>Kl. pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic>, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Acinetobacter baumanni</italic>, 
 <italic>Proteus mirabilis</italic>, methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MRSA) M87fox, 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic>, 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic> 103, 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> 18 01, 
 <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic>, 
 <italic>Enterobacter cloacae</italic>, 
 <italic>Citrobacter freundii</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus haemolyticus</italic>, 
 <italic>Pasteurella multocida</italic>. They revealed that 
 <italic>Lactobacillus uvarum</italic> LUHS245 strain inhibited 14 from the 15 tested pathogenic strains, and the highest inhibition zones against 
 <italic>Pasteurella multocida</italic> and 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> 18 01 were found (22.0 ± 0.2 and 21.5 ± 0.3 mm, respectively). 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> water extract showed antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>Pasteurella multocida</italic> with MIC value of 20.4 ± 4.1 mm, however 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> essential oil at 0.1% concentration inhibited 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic>, MRSA, 
 <italic>Pasteurella multocida</italic>, 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic>, 
 <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic>, and 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic>. They concluded that 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> essential oil, lactic acid bacteria strain LUHS245, and blackcurrants juice formulation immobilized in agar is the best one that consisted of all these and this formulation showed higher total phenolic compounds content, as well as higher overall acceptability.
