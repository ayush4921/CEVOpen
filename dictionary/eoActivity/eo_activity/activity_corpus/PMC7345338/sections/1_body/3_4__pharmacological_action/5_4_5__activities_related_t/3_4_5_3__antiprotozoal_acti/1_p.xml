 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> and its extracts have antiprotozoal activities. The extracts of the plant exhibited antiprotozoal action on several apicomplexan parasites (e.g., 
 <italic>Eimeria</italic>, 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, 
 <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, 
 <italic>Babesia</italic>, and 
 <italic>Theileria</italic>) and other protozoan parasites (e.g., 
 <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>, 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic>, and 
 <italic>Leishmania infantum</italic>) [

 <xref rid="B105-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Coccidiosis is one of the most important infections in livestock caused by 
 <italic>Eimeria</italic> species and of greater economic importance due to high morbidity rates. Anticoccidial activity of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> extracts has been reported in ruminants as well as in poultry; however, the activity depends on the number of oocysts and the type of 
 <italic>Eimeria</italic>. Aqueous 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> extract at a dose of 3 mg/kg of feed per day induced a substantial reduction in the number of oocysts in broiler infected with 
 <italic>Eimeria tenella</italic> and can be used as prophylactic treatment for moderate coccidiosis [

 <xref rid="B107-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. Nozari et al. [
 <xref rid="B105-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>] reported the potent antiparasitic effect of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> extract and showed that 100% tachyzoites were killed at 50, 100, and 200 mg/mL concentrations of the extract. The antileishmanial action of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> has been reported due to its flavonoids composition, and the activity of which is based on the existence of two hydroxyl groups at carbon position of C-4 and C-3 in the compound. Besides, the oxygenated monoterpenes present in 
 <italic>A. Absinthium</italic> essential oils shows antileishmanial activity on axenic amastigote and against promastigote types of two 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> strains (
 <italic>L. donovani</italic> and 
 <italic>L. aethiopica</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B108-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Additionally, Bailen et al. [
 <xref rid="B109-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>] reported that 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> essential oils demonstrated antiparasitic action on 
 <italic>L. infantum</italic> at all the investigated concentrations, however, at concentrations of 400 and 800 μg/mL, the essential oils showed activity against 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> under in vitro experimentation. Leishmanicidal and trypanocidal activities of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> essential oils have also been reported by Martínez-Díaz et al. [
 <xref rid="B110-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. Additionally, 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> L. essential oil demonstrated antileishmanial activity against intracellular amastigotes and promastigotes in a BALB/c mouse model of experimental cutaneous leishmaniasis [
 <xref rid="B111-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. In a drug delivery system of essential oils with nanoencapsulation, the stability and volatility of the used essential oils were elevated and reduced, respectively and also, to sustain the efficacy and water solubility of the essential oil-based formulations to acceptable therapeutic efficiency [
 <xref rid="B112-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. Tamargo et al. [
 <xref rid="B112-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>] inspected that 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> essential oils formulated in nanocochleates lead to tolerable, stable, and effective antileishmanial formulation with elevated action compared to treatment with the free essential oil. The nanocochleates 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> essential oil demonstrated activity on non-infected peritoneal macrophage and 
 <italic>L. amazonensis</italic> intracellular amastigotes with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 27.7 ± 5.6 and 21.5 ± 2.5 µg/mL. Mice treated with nanocochleates 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> essential oil (4 days/30 mg/kg/intralesional route/4 times) indicated no sign of weight loss or death. While the 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> essential oil nanocochleates formulations decreased the disease in model of murine experimental animals by about 50%. Percentage recorded was higher than the results obtained experimental animals administered with free 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> essential oil and control group. 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> displayed antimalarial action as reported by some researchers [
 <xref rid="B113-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>,
 <xref rid="B114-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. In a four day study, alcohol and aqueous 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> leaf extracts demonstrated a schizonticidal action on chloroquine-sensitive 
 <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> in mice. Intraperitoneal, subcutaneous and oral treatment with both alcohol and aqueous 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> extract showed parasitemia suppression, while the best result was obtained with the alcohol extract at a dose of 74 mg/kg (orally) [
 <xref rid="B114-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. The antimalarial actions of the compounds extracted from the plant were reported [
 <xref rid="B115-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. The aqueous extract and fraction of sesquiterpene lactone obtained from 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> abrogated 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> activity [
 <xref rid="B104-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>], as well as another study revealed that 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> aqueous extract possessed significant inhibition of 89.9% [
 <xref rid="B116-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. The antimalarial action of sesquiterpene lactone, artemisinin, isolated from 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> extract involves stimulation of both heme and mitochondrial-mediated degradation cascade that led to lipid peroxidation resulting in cytotoxic effect through reactive oxygen species synthesis and depolarization of both cell membrane and mitochondria [
 <xref rid="B117-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. On the other side, the plant stimulates free radical scavenging in the heme-mediated cascade [
 <xref rid="B118-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. Additionally, artemisinin act on 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> translationally controlled tumor protein (
 <italic>Pf</italic>TCTP), as it binds with the protein and form a covalent interaction leading to impaired the 
 <italic>Pf</italic>TCTP activity [
 <xref rid="B119-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>,
 <xref rid="B120-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. Eckstein-Ludwig et al. [
 <xref rid="B121-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>] indicated that artemisinin can also inhibit 
 <italic>Pf</italic>ATP6, an endoplasmic reticulum/orthologous Sarco ATPase- Ca
 <sup>+2</sup> (SERCA) found in the cytosol. In another study artemisinin inhibited enzymes that are involved in vital metabolic cascade. These enzymes include L-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 
 <italic>S</italic>-adenosyl-methionine synthetase (SAMS), pyruvate kinase (PyrK), spermidine synthase (SpdSyn) and ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) and it forms a covalent bond with these enzymes resulting in irreversible inhibition of their activities [
