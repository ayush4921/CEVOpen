<p>Sadoughi et al. [
 <xref rid="B85-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] recorded the efficacy of aqueous 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> extract in diminishing the serum levels of inflammatory cytokines and elevating the efficacy of the ovary tissue antioxidant enzymes. Additionally, it has a significant enhancement of hormones like luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol, and testosterone in rats suffering from polycystic ovary disorder. Wormwood extract activity was attributed to its bioactive constituents, phytosterols, which suppress the efficacy of 5-alpha-reductase enzyme, resulting in significant suppression on the plasma level of the dihydrotestosterone. In addition, phytosterols were documented to decrease tissue response to androgens besides diminishing the efficacy of androgens (e.g., testosterone) through suppressing aromatase and 5-alpha-reductase enzymes. Kostadinović et al. [
 <xref rid="B86-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] recorded that the dietary supplementation of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> induced maximum growth performance and antioxidative status. There was a remarkable elevation in both protein and breast meat content while decreased fat content. So, 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> can be applied as a natural feed additive for broilers and increasing the meat yield in chicken’s breast, and thus it has a significant role in promoting animal growth.
