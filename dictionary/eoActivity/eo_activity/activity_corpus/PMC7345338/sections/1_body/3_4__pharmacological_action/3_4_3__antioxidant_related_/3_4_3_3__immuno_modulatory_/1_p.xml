 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> was also reported to show activity against syndromes mediated by immunity in medicine. Notably, 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> extracts was reported to reduce tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and provide synergistic action on healing in patients with Crohn’s disease [
 <xref rid="B55-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Moreover, Shahnazi et al. [
 <xref rid="B56-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] documented the immuno-modulatory effect of ethanolic 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> extract on the function and maturation of dendritic cells (DCs). They revealed that this extract adjusts the immune stimuli toward a Th1 pattern at concentrations less than 100 µg/mL through activating CD40 expression on DCs, production of cytokine, as well as inhibiting the dendritic T cell-stimulating effect. It was shown that polysaccharides obtained from 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> possess immunomodulatory effect through the Th1 response initiation and activation of NO synthesis [

 <xref rid="B58-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] indicated the wound healing activity of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> by triggering the curative development of the wound of Achilles tendon in rabbit. This may be related to the free radical scavenging of 
 <italic>β</italic>-thujone and 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene isolated from 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> [
