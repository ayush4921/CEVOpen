<p>Hurrell et al. [
 <xref rid="B82-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] revealed that 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> extract displayed hypolipidemic, antiatherosclerotic, and hypocholesterolemic activity. Daradka et al. [
 <xref rid="B83-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>] also investigated the lipid-reducing action of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> in rabbits with hypercholesterolemia. They showed that ethanol extract of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> decreases triacylglycerol and serum cholesterol by 8-3.5-fold. Some of the proposed lipid-lowering action of the plant is attributed to its cholestatic action in the liver through the breakdown or removal of lipoproteins and/or abrogation of lipid hydrolytic enzymes in the lysosomes secreted by the hepatocytes. Moreover, Daradka et al. [
 <xref rid="B69-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] demonstrated the efficacy of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> in reducing the total cholesterol level in diabetic rats through inhibition the activities of the enzymes involved in the cholesterol biosynthesis and decreasing the lipolysis which is under the influence of insulin. Moreover, Khori et al. [
 <xref rid="B84-antibiotics-09-00353" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>] showed that 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> extracts have antiarrhythmic action during supraventricular tachyarrhythmia treatment.
