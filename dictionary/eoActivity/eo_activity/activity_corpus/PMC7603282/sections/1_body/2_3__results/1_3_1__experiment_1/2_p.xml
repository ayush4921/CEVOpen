<p>For the SBM substrate, the application of GA resulted in lower (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.026; 14.26 vs. 154.2 m
 <italic>M</italic> L
 <sup>−1</sup>) total SCFA concentration than CON, while applying IN and SA had no effect on this measure (
 <xref rid="microorganisms-08-01605-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The IVNDFD of the SBM substrate was completely degraded (100%) in all treatments because it had a low NDF concentration. The application of GA tended to produce higher concentrations of propionate (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.097) and valerate (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.096) relative to other treatments, while SA tended to produce a higher concentration of isovalerate (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.072). For the BGH substrate, the application of IN and SA increased (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.004; 440 and 411 vs. 308 and 323 g kg
 <sup>−1</sup>) IVDMD relative to CON and GA. The application of GA decreased (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001; 217 vs. 370, 356, and 312 g kg
 <sup>−1</sup>) IVNDFD relative to all treatments. The application of SA resulted in the highest (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001; 20.5 vs. 17.4, 17.0, and 17.9 mgN dL
 <sup>−1</sup>) ammonia-N concentration, while the application of GA was associated with the lowest (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001; 119.8 vs. 136.1, 130.2, 131.7 m
 <italic>M</italic> L
 <sup>−1</sup>) total SCFA concentration.
