<p>For the SBM substrate, the 
 <italic>F. succinogens</italic> population was lowest (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; 2.36 and 2.63 vs. 9.13 vs. 18.8) for IN and SA, followed by CON, and highest for GA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-01605-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Furthermore, the 
 <italic>R. albus</italic> population was higher (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.046; 24.5 vs. 10.8) for SA than CON, while those for GA and IN did not differ compared to other treatments. The

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; 0.61 vs. 0.44 vs. 0.01 and 0.05) for SA, followed by GA, and lowest for CON and SA. The

 <italic>p</italic> = 0.014; 0.08 and 0.08 vs. 0.04) for GA and IN than CON, while that for SA did not differ compared to other treatments. The methanogenic archaea population was not affected by the application of EO. For the BGH substrate, the population of 
 <italic>R. flavefaciens</italic> was higher (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.005; 1.79 vs. 0.53, 0.67, and 0.60) in CON than all EO treatments.
