<p>Different active EO compounds have likely contributed to the specific responses on rumen fermentation in the above studies [

 <xref rid="B6-microorganisms-08-01605" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. For example, dietary addition of wormwood as hay or silage has given different rumen fermentation results in sheep, perhaps because the wormwood active compounds differ [

 <xref rid="B9-microorganisms-08-01605" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Kim et al. [
 <xref rid="B7-microorganisms-08-01605" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] discovered that wormwood hay contained Carypophyllene Oxide, 1-Borneol, Camphor, and 
 <italic>trans</italic>-Caryophyllene as the major active compounds, while wormwood silage contained Î³-Selinene and 3-Cyclohexen-1-ol. In some previous studies, EO has provided an antibacterial activity that could decrease pathogenic bacteria populations and increase feed efficiency [
 <xref rid="B1-microorganisms-08-01605" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, some active compounds of EO could also inhibit rumen fermentation [
 <xref rid="B2-microorganisms-08-01605" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In the present study, different wormwood species had different active compounds (
 <xref rid="microorganisms-08-01605-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) that likely contributed to the different results on rumen digestibility, fermentation, and microbial diversity. More research investigating the active compounds of each wormwood species and how they are affected by the preservation method is warranted to develop feed additives from wormwood EO.
