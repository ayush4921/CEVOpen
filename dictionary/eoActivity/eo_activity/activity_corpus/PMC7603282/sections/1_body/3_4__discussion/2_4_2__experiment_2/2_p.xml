<p>The application of SA EO at different levels to SBM had no effects on fibrolytic bacteria populations in this study for unknown reasons. The application of 1 mg/kg of SA to SBM substrate increased the populations of 
 <italic>F. succinogenes</italic> and 
 <italic>R. albus</italic>, while the application of 10 mg/kg SA decreased them. This result was similar to previous studies, which have shown that appropriate doses of EO could increase fibrolytic bacteria populations, but excessive doses inhibit their growth [

 <xref rid="B31-microorganisms-08-01605" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. A previous in vivo study has also reported that increasing the level of a commercial EO mixture containing thymol, eugenol, vanillin, guauacol, and limonene to 150 mg kg
 <sup>âˆ’1</sup> concentrate in the diet of dairy ewes has increased fibrolytic bacteria population in the rumen [

 <xref rid="B2-microorganisms-08-01605" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] reported that the growth of different fibrolytic bacteria varied with the level of EO applied. This may explain why growth responses of 
 <italic>S. bovis</italic> and 
 <italic>R. flavefaciens</italic> differed from those of 
 <italic>F. succinogenes</italic> and 
 <italic>R. albus</italic> when different doses of SA EO were examined in the present study. In addition to the dose, the specific individual and combined effects of active EO compounds likely contribute to modulating the growth of the fibrolytic bacteria [
