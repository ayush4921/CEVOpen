<p>Interest in alternative feed additives has increased over the last few decades since many countries, including the European Union and the United States of America, imposed mandatory or voluntary restrictions on the use of antibiotics for animal production due to adverse effects on human health. Essential oils (EO), which have antimicrobial and antioxidant activity, have been studied extensively as feed additives to replace antibiotics in livestock diets. In general, EO can modify ruminal microbial fermentation and improve ruminant performance [

 <italic>Matricaria chamomilla</italic> L.), fumitory (
 <italic>Fumaria officinalis</italic> L.), and mallow (
 <italic>Malva sylvestris</italic> L.)) as EO sources has decreased ammonia-N and methane concentration in vitro [
