<p>In the present study, the application of SA wormwood had more beneficial effects than GA and IN wormwood as it increased in vitro DMD of BGH and increased the population of 
 <italic>R. albus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. bovis</italic> when the SBM was fermented. The major active compounds in SA were 
 <italic>trans</italic>-Caryophyllene, δ-Cadinene, α-Cadinol, and T-Muurolol. In addition, the applications of SA at 0.1 mg/kg increased the rumen fermentation and in vitro DMD of SBM, while the 1 mg/kg dose increased the population of 
 <italic>F. succinogenes</italic> and 
 <italic>R. albus</italic> when the SBM was fermented. The 10 mg/kg dose of SA increased the in vitro DMD of BGH, while the 1 and 10 mg/kg doses increased in vitro fermentation.
