<p>The sub-sampled buffered rumen fluid supernatant samples reserved for the analysis of microbial diversity were transferred into screw-capped tubes containing silica beads. The samples were shaken using a bead beater (Mini bead beater, Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL, USA). The DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The DNA concentrations were measured with a NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (ND-1000, Palto Alto, CA, USA). The PCR primer sets used for the amplification of general bacteria, Methanogenic archaea,

Real-time PCR assays were performed on a Bio-Rad C1000 Touch Thermal cycler Real-Time PCR detection system (CFX96 Real-Time System, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA), according to the methods described by Denman and McSweeney [
 <xref rid="B18-microorganisms-08-01605" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Assays were set up using an SYBR Green Real-Time PCR Master Mix (TOYOBO Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan). After real-time PCR, the cycle threshold (Ct) values were used to determine the fold change of different microbial populations relative to the respective blanks without EO application both in Experiment 1 and Experiment 2. The quantity of the microbes was estimated by the equation: relative quantification = 2
 <sup>-ΔCt (target)- ΔCt (control)</sup>, where Ct represents the threshold cycle. A negative control without the template DNA was used in every real-time PCR assay for each primer. The PCR condition for the amplification of target DNA is shown in
