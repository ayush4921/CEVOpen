<p>The low and high fiber substrates consisted of soybean meal (SBM) and bermudagrass hay (BGH, Cynodon dactylon cultivar Tifton 85), respectively. The concentrations of DM and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) of SBM were 889 g kg
 <sup>−1</sup> and 93.0 g kg
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively, and those for BGH were 925 g kg
 <sup>−1</sup> and 664 g kg
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. Those substrates were obtained from the Dairy Research Unit, the University of Florida, dried at 60 °C for 48 h, and ground through a 1-mm screen using a Willey mill (Arthur H. Thomas, Philadelphia, PA, USA) for later use as in vitro fermentation substrates. The EO was extracted from three different Korean native species of wormwoods—Ganghwa (GA), Injin (IN), and San (SA). The raw SA was collected from Jinju, Gyeongnam province, while the raw GA was collected in Ganghwa, Incheon province, South Korea. The powder IN was obtained from Puleun-won Company (Yeongcheon, Gyeonggi province, Korea). Each wormwood was extracted by steam distillation, as described by Maarse and Kepner [
 <xref rid="B10-microorganisms-08-01605" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], using the distillation and heating apparatus (Heating Mantle, M tops, Seoul, Korea) described by Likens and Nickerson [
 <xref rid="B11-microorganisms-08-01605" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The identification of EO composition for each wormwood spp. was determined following the protocol of Kim et al. [
 <xref rid="B7-microorganisms-08-01605" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] with a gas chromatograph (Hewlett Packard GC-5890A, Hewlett-Packard Company, Wilmington, NC, USA) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a DB-5 column (60 mm × 0.32 mm × 0.25 µm) coupled to a mass spectrometer (Joel JMS-700, Joel Ltd., West Yorkshire, UK).
