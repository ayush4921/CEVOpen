<p>The animal care procedure was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Florida, USA. Two rumen cannulated non-lactating Holstein cows (40 mo of age) fed 9 kg of coastal bermudagrass (
 <italic>Cynodon dactylon</italic>) hay, and 400 g of soybean meal daily were used as the inoculum donor. Rumen fluid was collected before morning feeding. Rumen fluid (pH 6.65) was filtered through two layers of cheesecloth and mixed with an anaerobic culture medium at a 1:2 ratio to make buffered rumen inoculum, as described by Adesogan et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-microorganisms-08-01605" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Dried samples of SBM and BGH, respectively, at 0.5 g were added to 40 mL of buffered rumen inoculum within incubation bottles. In Experiment 1, buffered rumen fluid was treated with or without EO from different native wormwood species to give the following treatments: no EO (Control; CON), GA, IN, and SA. All EO treatments were applied at 5 mg/kg per 40 mL of buffered rumen inoculum. The most effective EO among GA, IN, and SA for improving rumen fermentation indices and population of fibrolytic bacteria was used in Experiment 2.
