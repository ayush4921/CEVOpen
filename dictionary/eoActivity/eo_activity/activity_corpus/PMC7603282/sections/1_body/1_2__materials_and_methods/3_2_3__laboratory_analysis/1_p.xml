<p>After incubation, buffered rumen fluid (1 mL) from all bottles, including blanks, was sub-sampled for the analysis of microbial diversity using PCR. The remaining buffered rumen fluid after the incubation was filtered through previously dried (60 °C for 48 h) filter paper (Whatman 451 Grade 1, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). The residues on the filter paper were dried for 48 h at 60 °C and weighed. The substrates and dried residues were analyzed for NDF [

 <sup>200</sup> Fiber Analyzer. Residue weights and NDF concentration were used to calculate in vitro DM digestibility (IVDMD) and in vitro NDF digestibility (IVNDFD), according to a previous study [

The pH and ammonia-N were measured with an electric pH meter (SevenEasy™ pH Meter S20, Mettler Toledo, Greifensee, Switzerland) and a colorimetric procedure described by Chaney and Marbach [
