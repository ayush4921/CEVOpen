<p id="p0155">The thrombolytic activity of a drug is defined as the ability to dissolve dangerous clots in blood vessels, improve blood flow, and prevent damage to tissues and organs. Thrombolytic agents are used to treat a heart attack, stroke, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and occlusion of peripheral artery or indwelling catheter [

 <italic>Leea indica</italic> leaves showed moderate thrombolytic effect [

 <italic>Leea</italic> genus might have such activity and need to do further study to explore their activity.
