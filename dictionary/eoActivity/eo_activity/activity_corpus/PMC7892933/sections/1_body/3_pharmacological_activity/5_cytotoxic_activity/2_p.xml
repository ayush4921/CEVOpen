<p id="p0110">The cytotoxicity is the quality of being toxic to cells. Cytotoxic drugs prevent or inhibit the function of cells [
 <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Exposing cells to a cytotoxic compound may result in a variety of cell fates. The cells may undergo necrosis in which they lose membrane integrity and die rapidly due to cell lysis. Cytotoxic drugs are drugs used to destroy cancer cells. Cytotoxic drugs inhibit cell division, thereby leading to die of cancer cells. Two previous studies stated that the ethanolic and methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>Leea indica</italic> leaves exhibited cytotoxic activity in experimental models [
 <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. In another study, it was reported that the ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>Leea macrophylla</italic> roots showed preliminary cytotoxic activity [
 <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. These results together suggest that the 
 <italic>Leea</italic> plants might show a potential anticancer activity.
