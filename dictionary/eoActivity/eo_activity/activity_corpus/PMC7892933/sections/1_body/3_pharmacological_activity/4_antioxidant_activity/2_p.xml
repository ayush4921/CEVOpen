<p id="p0105">Oxidation is a chain of chemical reactions that produces free radicals, thereby leading to damage the living cells of organisms. Antioxidants are substances that inhibit oxidation [
 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Antioxidants play vital role in maintaining good health of human being and preserving foods by protecting cellular materials such as DNA and lipid in the body from oxidation. It was reported that the methanolic extract of 
 <italic>Leea asiatica</italic> leaves possessed significant antioxidant activity by increasing the levels of endogenous antioxidant enzymes [
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The extract of 
 <italic>Leea aequata</italic> leaves showed a moderate antioxidant effect, which was confirmed by scavenging the DPPH free radicals [
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The ethanolic extract of root of 
 <italic>Leea rubra</italic> has potent radical scavenging activity [
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Previous two studies reported that the ethanolic extract and its different fractions of 
 <italic>Leea macrophylla</italic> root tubers were reported to have potential antioxidant activity [
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The water and methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>Leea indica</italic> leaves exhibited significant antioxidant activity [
 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. These 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> reported data indicate that 
 <italic>Leea</italic> species are an important source of natural antioxidants that can suppose to prevent cell damage by preventing or scavenging free radicals and by improving the levels of endogenous antioxidant enzymes.
