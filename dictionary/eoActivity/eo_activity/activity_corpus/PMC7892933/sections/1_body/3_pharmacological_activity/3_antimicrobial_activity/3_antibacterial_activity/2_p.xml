<p id="p0080">The ethyl acetate extract of 
 <italic>Leea rubra</italic> root was reported to have a significant antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>Leea macrophylla</italic> root tubers showed a wide range of antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The n-hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and methanol extracts of 
 <italic>Leea macrophylla</italic> seed were effective against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The essential oil of 
 <italic>Leea indica</italic> flowers showed strong antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> and moderate activity against 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The dichloromethane extract of 
 <italic>Leea indica</italic> stems exhibited significant activity against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermis</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. A separate study stated that the extracts of seed, stem and root of 
 <italic>Leea aequata</italic> were reported to have antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>Bacillus anthracis, Bacillus pumilis, Salmonella paratyphi, Staphylococcus albus, X. compestria,</italic> and 
 <italic>X.Â malvacearum</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. All these reported data indicate that 
 <italic>Leea</italic> plants have antibacterial potentials and could be equally effective against other microorganisms like fungi, virus, etc.
