<p id="p0055">Review papers generally tend to include both quantitative and narrative or more qualitative components; together, thereby provide platforms for new conceptual frameworks, reveal inconsistencies in the extant body of research, synthesize diverse results, and generally give other scholars a new window for further research. In this review, a comprehensive literature review was carried out to provide an integrated, synthesized overview of the current state of knowledge, develop conceptual frameworks to reconcile and extend past research, describe research insights, existing gaps, and future research directions by providing information regarding traditional uses, bioactive phytochemicals, and pharmacological activities of the species of the genus 
 <italic>Leea</italic>. A literature review was carried out by referring flora, journals and by using several search engines such as Google scholar, Pubmed, Science direct, Research gate, etc. A schematic diagram (
