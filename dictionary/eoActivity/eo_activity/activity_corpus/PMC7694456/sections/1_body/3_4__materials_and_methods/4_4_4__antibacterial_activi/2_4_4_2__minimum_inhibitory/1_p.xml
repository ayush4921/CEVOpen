<p>The minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) and the minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) were assessed in triplicates on 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) as described previously [
 <xref rid="B54-pharmaceuticals-13-00369" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. A bacterial suspension at a density of 0.5 McFarland standards turbidity was prepared from an overnight culture. Then, a serial two-fold dilution for each EOs (50 mg/mL stock solution) was made in 5 mL of nutrient broth with concentration ranged from 0.012â€“50 mg/mL.
