<p>Each well of the 96-well plates contains 95 μL of nutrient broth and 5 μL of the bacterial inoculum. A 100 μL aliquot from the stock solutions of each EO was added into the first well. Then, 100 μL from the serial dilutions were transferred into the consecutive well. The negative control well contains 195 μL of nutrient broth without EO and 5 μL of the bacterial inoculum. The final volume in each well was 200 μL, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 18–24 h.</p>
