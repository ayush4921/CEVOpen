<p>This finding corroborates the recent data of Cordeiro et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-pharmaceuticals-13-00369" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] showing that the strongest antibiofilm activity of terpinen-4-ol was against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Other studies have also demonstrated that this compound possesses an excellent potential against biofilm formed by some pathogenic bacteria like 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B41-pharmaceuticals-13-00369" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], 
 <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic>, 
 <italic>Lactobacillus acidophilus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B42-pharmaceuticals-13-00369" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], 
 <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic>, and Fusobacterium nucleatum [
 <xref rid="B43-pharmaceuticals-13-00369" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Biofilm inhibition properties of 
 <italic>O. majorana</italic>, 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic>, and 
 <italic>T. zygis</italic> EOs against MRSA suggest that the addition of these oils before biofilm formation eliminates planktonic cells and may reduce the polystyrene surface adherence, which becomes less susceptible to cell adhesion. Additionally, the modification of MRSA surface proteins caused by their interactions with oils inhibits the adhesion of this bacterium to the polystyrene surface, which is the initial attachment phase [
