<p>Concerning 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> EO, we detected an antibiofilm effect on 79.31% of the isolates (23 strains). Furthermore, two groups of five isolates (17.24%) were changed. The first group was varied from low-grade positive to biofilm negative, and the second group was passed from highly positive to low-grade positive. In addition, the same isolate that changed from highly positive to biofilm negative under 
 <italic>O. majorana</italic> EO, also became biofilm negative under 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> EO. The percentage of inhibition extended from 10.20 to 95.65%.
