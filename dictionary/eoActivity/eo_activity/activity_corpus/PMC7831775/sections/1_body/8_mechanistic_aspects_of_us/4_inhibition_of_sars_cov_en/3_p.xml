 <sc>d</sc>-glucose have been shown to significantly block the entry of SARS-CoV into the cells. 
 <xref rid="bib150" ref-type="bibr">Yi et al. (2004)</xref> studied the effects of these small molecules on the entry of SARS-CoV. All three molecules (luteolin, quercetin and etra-
 <italic>O</italic>-galloyl- 
 <italic>β</italic>-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucose) showed promising results with EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 83.4 μM, 10.6 μM and 4.5 μM, respectively. Assays based on a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-luc/SARS pseudo-typed virus were used for experiments on viral entry inhibition. The results confirmed that along with luteolin, and etra-
 <italic>O</italic>-galloyl- 
 <italic>β</italic>-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucose, quercetin also had activity against HIV-luc/SARS with a lower cytotoxicity of quercetin. Therefore, as an FDA-approved drug ingredient, quercetin can be applied as a potential drug in the clinical treatment of COVID-19.
