<p id="p0155">For instance, 
 <xref rid="bib122" ref-type="bibr">Sornpet et al. (2017)</xref> demonstrated the biological activity of crude extracts of five medicinal plants found in Asia (
 <italic>Andrographis paniculata, Curcuma longa, Gynostemma pentaphyllum</italic>, 
 <italic>Kaempferia parviflora</italic>, and 
 <italic>Psidium guajava</italic>) against highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H5N1). The study concluded that aqueous and methanolic extract of all the plants resulted in a significant antiviral activity. Among the plants 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> and 
 <italic>K. parviflora</italic> boosted the immune response against H5N1 by increasing the messenger RNA expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and interferon beta (IFN-
 <italic>β</italic>). Similarly, 
 <xref rid="bib108" ref-type="bibr">Rajasekaran et al. (2013)</xref> showed that fifty medicinal plants, originating from the tropical rainforests possess potent anti-influenza virus activity. The tested plants proved to be minimally cytotoxic and had significant potential for the inhibition of viral neuraminidase and hemagglutination. Similarly, 
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Choi et al. (2019)</xref>, successfully employed Geranii Herba (
 <italic>Geranium thunbergii</italic>) for the inhibition of neuraminidase activity in influenza viruses. In fact, there are many studies available on the strong anti-influenza virus activity of different plants.
