<p id="p0225">Plant lectins have also been showed to potently block the entry of SARS-CoV into the cells. 
 <xref rid="bib160" ref-type="bibr">Keyaerts et al. (2007)</xref> showed that lectins isolated from many different plants showed a promising 
 <italic>anti</italic>-SARS-CoV activity with EC
 <sub>50</sub> ranging from 0.45 to &gt;100 μg/mL and CC
 <sub>50</sub> value ranging from 50 to 100 μg/mL. Among all of them, the highest 
 <italic>anti</italic>-coronavirus activity through cytopathic effects was reported among mannose-binding lectins isolated from 
 <italic>Allium porrum</italic> with a selectivity index of &gt;222. The study revealed that apart from interference with viral replication during the viral life cycle, the lectins seemed to inhibit viral entry to the cell.
