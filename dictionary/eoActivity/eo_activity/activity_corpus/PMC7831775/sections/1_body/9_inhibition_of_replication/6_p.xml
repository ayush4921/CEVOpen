<p id="p0235">Similarly, terpenoids were also found to be effective in blocking viral replication. Ferruginol, pinusolidic acid, and α-cadinol were purified from ethyl acetate extracts of 
 <italic>Chamaecyparis obtuse</italic>, along with cedrane-3β,12-diol, and betulonic acid, isolated from 
 <italic>Juniperus formosana</italic> and cryptojaponol isolated from 
 <italic>Cryptomeria japonica.</italic> The study indicated that most of the terpenoids inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV at EC
 <sub>50</sub> between 3.8 and 7.5 μM and an CC
 <sub>50</sub> value greater than 250 μM. It was confirmed through ELISA that the terpenoids block the S proteins of the virus to induce replication inhibition activity. The study also confirmed a strong 
 <italic>anti</italic>-3CLpro activity through docking studies and concluded that, in their pure form, terpenoids could be beneficial as drug candidates against SARS-CoV (
