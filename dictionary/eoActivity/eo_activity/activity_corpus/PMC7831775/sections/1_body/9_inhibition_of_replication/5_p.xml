<p id="p0230">Flavonoids have also been shown to possess a considerable activity against the coronaviruses. 
 <xref rid="bib110" ref-type="bibr">Ryu et al. (2010)</xref> reported that flavonoids such as apigenin, luteolin, and quercetin purified from ethanolic leaf extracts of 
 <italic>Torreya nucifera</italic>, an Asian traditional medicinal plant also showed significant SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibiting activity. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of the 3CLpro inhibitors (apigenin, luteolin, and quercetin) were recorded to be 280.8, 20.2, and 23.8 μM, respectively. The results of these of these enzymatic studies were confirmed through binding energy studies via molecular docking. Furthermore, among these compounds, a carbon moiety of apigenin showed stronger activity compared to other flavonoids.
