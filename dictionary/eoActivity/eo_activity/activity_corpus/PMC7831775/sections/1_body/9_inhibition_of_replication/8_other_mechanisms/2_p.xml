<p id="p0245">Phytochemicals can also play a role in other aspects of the SARS-CoV infection. For instance, 
 <xref rid="bib116" ref-type="bibr">Schwarz et al. (2011)</xref> showed that, emodin, the anthraquinone from family 
 <italic>Polygonaceae</italic> can inhibit the 3a ion channel of coronavirus and thus inhibit the release of SARS-CoV form infected cells (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Apart from this, phytochemicals can be effective in the immune modulation against coronaviruses (
 <xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">Lau et al., 2008</xref>) and can also act analgesics, and symptom management such as reduction of hypoxemia and dyspnea management. These studies suggest that phytochemicals can be employed against SARS-CoV-2, for their diverse roles and potency against other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV.
