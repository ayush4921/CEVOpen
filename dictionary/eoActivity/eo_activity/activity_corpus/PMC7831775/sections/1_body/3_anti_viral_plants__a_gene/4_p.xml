Experiments have revealed that there are many important plant-based compounds i.e. secondary metabolites with marked antiviral activities These include alkaloids, flavonoids (such as quercetin), lignans (phyllanthine), polyphenolcs (tannins), and terpenoids (Glycyrrhizinic acid), which have shown strong
