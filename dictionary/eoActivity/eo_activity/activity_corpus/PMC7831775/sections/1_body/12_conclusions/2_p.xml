<p id="p0260">Medicinal plants can provide a very plausible platform for the search for drug candidates to be tested against COVID-19. The secondary metabolism of many plants serves as a treasure of phytochemicals, which have shown promising results against human viruses. More specifically, phytochemicals serve as phytotherapeutic agents against the coronaviruses especially SARS coronaviruses. Phytochemicals are advantageous in their timeliness, the sense that they are biocompatible and less toxic to synthetic drugs. Based on studies of phytomedicine against the previous SARS-CoV, the most potent phytochemicals could be filtered and put to test against COVID-19. Similarly, while trials are underway for testing vaccines, traditional herbal medicine in the form of decoctions, tea or powder could be tested (based on enough evidence of efficacy) for the alleviation of symptoms.</p>
