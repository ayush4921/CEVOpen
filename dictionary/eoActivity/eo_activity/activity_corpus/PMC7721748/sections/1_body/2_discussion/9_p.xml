<p id="Par20">In general, MNN proves its efficiency when the total amount of data is limited. Hereby, more significantly, another efficient classification model based on the CNN is created. The proposed CNN is developed in such a way to handle the ambiguity and inconsistency that appeared in the chemical compositions values which could not be fully treated with the MNN. One of the mysterious characteristics in the essential oil(s) is that, they may contain some chemical compounds that have no biological influence activity, and this may be due to the inconsistency among these compounds. Thus, a number of compounds/oils that have no effect in a certain EOâ€™s pool may be found, but they may show a clear influence if they are found with other compounds in another EO pool
