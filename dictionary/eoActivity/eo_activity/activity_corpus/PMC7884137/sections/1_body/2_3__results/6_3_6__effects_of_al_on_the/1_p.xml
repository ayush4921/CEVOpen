<p>A dissociation curve analysis of IKK-
 <italic>α</italic>, NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-
 <italic>α,</italic> or 
 <italic>ββ</italic>-actin showed a single peak. The 260/280 nm absorbance ratios were all between 1.8 and 2.0. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, compared with the control group, the lower level of IL-4 mRNA and higher levels of NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> mRNA were found in the LPS group (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05), but there was no difference in the level of IKK-
 <italic>α</italic> between them. The mRNA expressions of IL-4 after AL treatments were significantly higher than those in the LPS group in a dose-dependent manner. However, the mRNA expressions of NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> were significantly lower than those in the LPS group in a dose-dependent manner. In general, the processed AL showed better NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> decreasing and IL-4 increasing effects compared with the crude AL.
