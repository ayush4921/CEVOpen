<p>The etiology of UC is poorly known, but it is generally considered the inflammatory response to be one of the important pathogenic factors. In recent years, the role of cytokines in the development, pathogenesis, and prognosis of UC has been recognized. Studies have shown that interleukin (IL) plays an important role during the pathogenesis of UC [

 <italic>α</italic> is a primary and earliest proinflammatory cytokine and regarded as a parameter of systemic and local inflammation reactions [

 <italic>α</italic> and IL-6 are considered to be the markers of inflammation in patients with UC [

 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. IL-1
 <italic>β</italic> is a key mediator of the inflammatory and immunological response, and several biological properties may be of relevance in the pathogenesis of UC [

 <italic>β</italic> promotes the expressions of other inflammatory cytokines [
