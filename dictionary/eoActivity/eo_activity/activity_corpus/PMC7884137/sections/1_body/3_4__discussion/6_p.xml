<p>In our study, we determined the mRNA expressions of NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B and IKK
 <italic>α</italic> by quantitative real-time PCR. The results showed that the level of NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B was higher in the LPS group compared with the control group, and after treatment with the essential oil from AL, the level of NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B was significantly lower than that in the LPS group in a dose-dependent manner. However, there was no difference in the level of IKK
 <italic>α</italic> in all the groups. In addition, the expressions of IKK-
 <italic>α</italic>, p-IKK-
 <italic>α</italic>, p-IKK-
 <italic>β</italic>, and NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B proteins were determined by Western blot. Compared with the control group, higher levels of p-IKK-
 <italic>α</italic>, p-IKK-
 <italic>β</italic>, and NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B were found in the LPS group. The levels of p-IKK-
 <italic>α</italic>, p-IKK-
 <italic>β</italic>, and NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B were lower in the treatment groups than those in the LPS group dose-dependently. There was no difference in the level of IKK-
 <italic>α</italic> in all the groups, and this result was in coincidence with the abovementioned results. This suggested the essential oil could inhibit the phosphorylation of IKK. The essential oil from the bran-processed AL showed better effects. These results suggested that the effects of essential oil obtained from the crude and bran-processed AL on LPS-induced inflammatory injury of HCoEpiC could be attributed partly to the potent anti-inflammatory property via downregulating the IKK/NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B signaling pathway.
