<p>LPS, a major component of the Gram-negative bacterial cell wall [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], can trigger strong inflammatory responses and induce production of a variety of proinflammatory cytokines [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In this study, we utilized LPS to trigger HCoEpiC inflammatory damage to compare the anti-inflammatory effects of essential oil obtained from the crude and bran-processed AL and evaluate the mechanism of anti-inflammatory action.
