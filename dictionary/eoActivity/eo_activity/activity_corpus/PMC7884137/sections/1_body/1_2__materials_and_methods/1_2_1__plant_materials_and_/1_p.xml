<p>The crude AL, purchased in Bozhou city of Anhui province in China, was identified as the rhizome of 
 <italic>Atractylodes lancea</italic> (Thunb.) DC. by Prof. Yanjun Zhai, working in School of Pharmacy, Liaoning University of TCM. The processed AL was prepared according to the method reported previously [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. LPS was purchased from Beijing Solarbio Science and Technology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). ELISA kits were obtained from Shanghai Lianshuo Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Ameko). PrimeScript® RT reagent kits with gDNA Eraser for real-time PCR and SYBR® Premix ExTaq™ II (TliRNaseH Plus) and ROX plus kits were all provided by TaKaRa Biotech Co. (Dalian, China). Primers for target genes were synthesized by Beijing Genomics Ins. (Beijing, China). TRIzol reagent was purchased from Invitrogen Corporation (CA, USA). 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) was purchased from Sigma Company. The following primary antibodies were used in Western blot analysis: rabbit antiinhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase-
 <italic>α</italic> (IKK-
 <italic>α</italic>) antibody (Cell Signaling; China), rabbit antiphospho inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase-
 <italic>α</italic>/
 <italic>β</italic> (p-IKK-
 <italic>α</italic>/
 <italic>β</italic>) antibody (Cell Signaling; China), rabbit antinuclear factor kappa-B (NF-
