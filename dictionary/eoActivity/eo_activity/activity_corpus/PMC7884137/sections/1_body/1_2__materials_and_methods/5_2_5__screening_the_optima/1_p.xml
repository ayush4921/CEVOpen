<p>The HCoEpiCs suspensions were planted in 96-well culture plate at 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well, respectively, and grown for 24 h. Different final concentrations of LPS (5, 10, and 15 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) were added and incubated for 12, 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively. The suspension without LPS was used as the control. Then, 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>l MTT (5 mg/mL) was added and incubated at 37°C for an additional 2 h. The supernatants were removed, and the formazan was dissolved in 150 
 <italic>μ</italic>L DMSO for 10 min. The absorbance was recorded at 570 nm by a microplate reader (Infinite M200, TECAN, Austria). The experiment was repeated three times.
