<p>The mRNA expressions of IKK-
 <italic>α</italic>, NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> were determined by quantitative real-time PCR. The cells, incubated with or without essential oil of AL, were subsequently treated with TRIzol reagent as recommended by the manufacturer. Total RNA was isolated utilizing the TRIzol total extraction kit. The concentration of mRNA was measured by a microspectrophotometer with the ratio of OD
 <sub>260</sub>/OD
 <sub>280</sub> &gt; 1.8 [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. All reverse-transcription of total RNA into cDNA was performed using the PrimeScript
 <sup>®</sup> RT reagent kit with gDNA Eraser. Real-time qRT-PCR, which consisted of denaturation at 95°C for 3 min and 40 cycles of denaturation for 5 sec at 95°C and annealing for 1 min at 60°C, was performed in a Stratagene Mx3000p PCR system (Agilent, German). Ct values of mRNAs were analyzed by normalizing with the internal control 
 <italic>β</italic>-actin. The primers for the genes are presented in
