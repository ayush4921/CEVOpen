<p>For GC-MS analysis, the extracted volatile oil samples were diluted in hexane (5 µL/mL) and analyzed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry using the Agilent Series System 7890A-5975C analyzer. For the quantitative analysis, calibration curves were constructed for the analytical standards, and the concentration ranges used were established experimentally after the injection for the qualitative analysis of the volatile oils. The acquisition parameters used for the proposed acquisition method were: DB-5 MS chromatographic column (60 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm-stationary phase made of poly-phenyl-arylene, nonpolar), temperature gradient elution, temperature program: 50 °C isotherm 3 min, 5 °C up to 300 °C, automatic injection in split mode, splitting rate 1:200, and injection volume 1 µL, flow rate 1 mL/min. The supplemental table lists the identified compounds in the essential oils from plants, retention times (expressed in minutes), and their relative areas (which are their areas reported to the total area of all compounds, expressed in percentages).</p>
