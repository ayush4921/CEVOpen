<p>PI is a membrane-impermeable dye that penetrates only cells with disrupted membranes, and as a consequence, the red PI fluorescence signal detected by the flow cytometer increases. Low-level fluorescence could be detected for the control viable cells. The red fluorescent signal of PI of the bacterial cell-exposed EOs, expressed as the median fluorescence intensity (MFI), was not significantly increased by comparison with the control, indicating the cells membranes were not compromised at EO subinhibitory concentrations.</p>
