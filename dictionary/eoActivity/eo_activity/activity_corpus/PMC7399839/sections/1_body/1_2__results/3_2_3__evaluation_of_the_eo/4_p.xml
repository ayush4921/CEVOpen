<p>Our study revealed that the tested EOs and the Î²-pinene analytical standard inhibited the activity of efflux pumps of 
 <italic>S. salivarius</italic> sp. 
 <italic>salivarius</italic> and 
 <italic>S. acidominimas</italic> (

 <xref rid="antibiotics-09-00428-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The FC measurements showed an increase of more than two-fold of the MFI of the EO-treated bacterial cells, indicating that EB accumulated inside the bacterial cells. These results suggest that the EOs of 
 <italic>S. hortensis, A. graveolens</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> act as potential inhibitors of the 
 <italic>S. salivarius</italic> sp. 
 <italic>salivarius</italic> and 
 <italic>S. acidominimas</italic> efflux pumps and could be considered promising candidates in developing potential adjuvant methods to therapeutically intervene against dental plaque biofilms. However, the FC analysis suggests that the mechanisms of action for these EOs are strain-specific, and further studies are required to address this issue.
