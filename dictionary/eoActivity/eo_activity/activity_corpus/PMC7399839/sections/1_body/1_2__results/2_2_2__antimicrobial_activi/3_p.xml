<p>The extract obtained from 
 <italic>A. graveolens</italic> showed a variation in the bacterial growth inhibitory activity, with MIC values between 0.71–91 mg/mL. Half of the tested strains were susceptible at an MICs of a maximum 22.75 mg/mL. The composition of the 
 <italic>A. graveolens</italic> EO is mainly monoterpenic, containing a high level of α- phellandrene (68.54%). The lower antimicrobial effect can be correlated with a low level of terpenoids in the 
 <italic>A. graveolens</italic> oil.
