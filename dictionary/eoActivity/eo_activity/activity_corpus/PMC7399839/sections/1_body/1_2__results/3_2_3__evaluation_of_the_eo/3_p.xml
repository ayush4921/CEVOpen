<p>The EB accumulation in bacterial cells exposed to subinhibitory concentration EOs was evaluated for the direct measurement of the inhibition of efflux at the single-cell level. The reduction in the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the bacterial cells correlated to the removal of the dye via efflux pumps [

Bacterial efflux pumps contribute to intrinsic resistance; typically, their overexpression confers a resistance to antibiotics, including fluoroquinolones, dyes (e.g., ethidium bromide), detergents (e.g., sodium dodecyl sulfate), and disinfectants. Genes encoding efflux pumps are usually chromosomally carried, ensuring the mutations among the community. Efflux inhibitors have been proven to be effective in suppressing bacterial virulence properties and antibiotic resistance [
