<p>Flow cytometry (FC) in combination with two fluorochromes: propidium iodide (PI) and ethidium bromide (EB) were used for investigating the overall impact of the studied EOs on bacterial cells. The bacterial cultures belonging to the 
 <italic>S. salivarius</italic> sp. 
 <italic>salivarius</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. acidominimas</italic> isolates grown in the presence of EOs at subinhibitory concentrations were analyzed by FC. The two strains were chosen due to their involvement in the first steps of dental plaque development and, also, because they are an important reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes in the dental biofilm.
