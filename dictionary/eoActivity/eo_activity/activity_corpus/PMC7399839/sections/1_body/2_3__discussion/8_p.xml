<p>Dental conditions such as tooth decay and periodontitis are directly related to the ability of bacteria to form biofilms [
 <xref rid="B40-antibiotics-09-00428" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] in the form of supragingival and subgingival plaques. The development of dental caries implies the existence of Gram-positive acidogenic and aciduric species (
 <italic>S. mutans, Lactobacillus</italic> sp., and 
 <italic>Actinomycetes</italic> sp.). On the other hand, periodontal lesions are associated with anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria (
 <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Prevotella</italic> sp., and 
 <italic>Fusobacterium</italic> sp.) [
 <xref rid="B41-antibiotics-09-00428" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The appearance and progression of these pathologies are influenced by the increased antibiotic resistance of bacterial biofilms [
 <xref rid="B42-antibiotics-09-00428" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. With the increase in antibiotic resistance rates and the emerging resistance to conventional treatments, the discovery of novel agents targeting the microorganisms included in the biofilm is an important step in controlling oral cavity infections [
