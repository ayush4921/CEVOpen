<p>Despite the inhibitory activity of the EOs tested, the antibiofilm effect of 
 <italic>S. hortensis</italic> EO was limited. Biofilm production of most of the strains was not inhibited by 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> and 
 <italic>A. graveolens</italic> EOs. This could be explained by the fact that bacterial cells incorporated into biofilms are more resistant to the action of conventional antibiotics compared to those in the planktonic state [
 <xref rid="B42-antibiotics-09-00428" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. To explain the resistance of biofilms to antimicrobial substances, a number of mechanisms have been proposed: (1) restricted penetration of antimicrobial agents, (2) induction of the general stress response, (3) low growth and metabolic rates, (4) increased expression of multidrug efflux pumps, (5) activation of the quorum sensing and the response mechanism, and (6) modification of the profiles of external membrane proteins.
