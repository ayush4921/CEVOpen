<p>Zeidan-Chulia reported the antibacterial and antigelatinolytic activities of 
 <italic>S. hortensis</italic> L. EO and recommended it for the potential treatment of periodontal inflammation. 
 <italic>A. graveolens</italic> EO presented a variable inhibitory activity, most of the tested strains being susceptible at concentrations of 45.5 mg/mL [
 <xref rid="B35-antibiotics-09-00428" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The antimicrobial effect can be correlated with the poor representation of terpenoids in the mixture, the extract being mostly monoterpenic, with 68.54% Î±-felandren. Compared to 
 <italic>S. hortensis,</italic> both 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> and 
 <italic>A. graveolens</italic> EOs were less efficient in inhibiting the bacterial growth.
