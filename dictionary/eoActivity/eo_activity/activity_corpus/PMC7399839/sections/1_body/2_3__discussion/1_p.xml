<p>The high incidence of oral diseases has triggered a global need for alternative prevention and treatment options that are both effective and economical. Despite some commercially available synthetic agents, these substances can alter the balance of the oral microbiota and have various local or systemic (e.g., vomiting, diarrhea, and staining of tooth enamel) side effects. For example, several antibacterial agents used in the prevention and treatment of oral conditions, including cetylpyridinium chloride, chlorhexidine, amino fluorides, or products containing such agents, are toxic and cause staining of the tooth enamel.</p>
