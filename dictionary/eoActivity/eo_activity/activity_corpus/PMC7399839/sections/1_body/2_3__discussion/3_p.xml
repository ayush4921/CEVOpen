<p>Volatile oils have an antimicrobial activity positively correlated with the distribution of terpene:terpenoids in the complex mixture, in which synergism/antagonism interactions occur. Thus, the antimicrobial effect of volatile oils can be the result of a synergic activity of different components, influenced by specific environmental factors (pH, salinity, and temperature) or by the morphophysiological characteristics of the tested microbial strains (e.g., affinity for Gram staining). Many plant families are known to produce volatile oils: 
 <italic>Apiaceae, Asteraceae, Cupressaceae, Hypericaceae, Lamiaceae, Liliaceae, Myrtaceae, Pinaceae, Piperaceae, Rosaceae, Rutaceae, Fabaceae, Santalaceae, Zingiberaceae,</italic> and 
 <italic>Zygophyllaceae.</italic> They are used as a selection basis for alternatives to antibiotics/biocides currently used in medical practice. Carson and Hammer, 2011, mentioned that all volatile oils exhibit antimicrobial potential at concentrations not exceeding 5% (
