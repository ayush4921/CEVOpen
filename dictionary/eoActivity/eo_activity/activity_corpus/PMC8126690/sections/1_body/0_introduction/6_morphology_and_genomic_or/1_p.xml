<p>Coronaviruses are taxonomically grouped into the order of Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae and subfamily Orthocoronavirinae. The subfamily is further divided into alpha, beta, delta, and gamma coronavirus genera. The beta coronavirus genus comprises SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 (

The lipid bilayer envelope which surrounds the viral particle is derived from the host cell membrane, and embeds three structural proteins, namely: 1) membrane (M), 2) envelope (E), and spike (S) glycoproteins. The other viral structural protein, nucleoprotein (N), is internally located and intimately associated with the viral genomic RNA (
