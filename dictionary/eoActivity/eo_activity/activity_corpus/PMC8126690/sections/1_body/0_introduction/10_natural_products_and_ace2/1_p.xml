<p>Natural products have for long been considered as important sources of therapeutic agents. These agents are remarkably low molecular weight molecules capable of eliciting enzyme activities due to their complex nature (
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">Malami et al., 2016</xref>). The secondary bioactive agents/plant metabolites, which are able to reduce or wholly inhibit enzyme catalytic activities, can be used as ACE2 modulators. Available evidence from previous studies supports the inhibitory properties of natural products toward ACE2 enzyme activity. Moreover, these natural products are considerably used in traditional medicine and are extensively found as part of the human diet. Here, we describe some of the common natural products that have been previously reported with ACE2 modulatory activity prior to the COVID-19 era (
