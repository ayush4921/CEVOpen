<p>Notably, the SARS-CoV-2 preferentially targets the respiratory tract. Alveolar type II cells (AT2) of the lungs express high levels of ACE2, making them the primal targets of SARS-CoV-2 (

However, due to the presence of SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 is prevented from modulating the protein angiotensin II (ANG II), thereby causing further damage to the blood vessels of the lungs, overall preventing oxygen and carbon (IV) oxide exchange. The resultant effect is difficulty in breathing and improper functioning of the lungs, which worsen the damaging effect to the lung parenchyma, ending up in bronchitis, edema, alveolar collapse and acute respiratory distress syndrome (
