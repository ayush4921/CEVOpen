<p>Several plant products have shown potential in interfering with the activity of ACE2 (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Du, 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Joshi et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">Poochi et al., 2020</xref>). For example, the essential oils from 
 <italic>Allium sativum L</italic> (garlic), 
 <italic>Ammoides pusilla (Brot.) Breistr.</italic>, 
 <italic>Melaleuca cajuputi Maton</italic> and 
 <italic>Sm. ex R. Powell</italic> (cajeput) and 
 <italic>Piper</italic> spp (pepper) like 
 <italic>Piper nigrum L.</italic> and 
 <italic>Piper retrofractum Vahl,</italic> can potentially latch onto ACE2 and competitively inhibit viral binding and entry (

 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Gutierrez-Villagomez et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">My et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">Thuy et al., 2020</xref>). These inhibitory effects have been attributed to the presence of certain ligands (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). For instance, 
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">Senthil Kumar et al. (2020)</xref> demonstrated that essential oils from geranium and lemon prove to be effective against ACE2 by downregulating its mRNA and protein expressions in epithelial cells. Further gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis identified citronellol, geraniol and neryl acetate in geranium oils, and limonene in lemon oils as the major ligands (particularly citronellol and limonene) responsible for the downregulation of ACE2 expression in HT-29 cells. Same ligands were also identified to inhibit TMPRSS2 (
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">Senthil Kumar et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, not all ligands that bind with ACE2 inhibit its enzymatic activity (
 <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">Williamson and Kerimi, 2020</xref>). The fact that some of these essential oils bear several molecules with binding capacity hints to some possible synergistic effect that may account for the overall efficacy of essential oils. Interestingly, some of these interactive ligands can be synthesized (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Gutekunst et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2012</xref>), indicating a vastly unexplored potential. Additionally, in a novel attempt, Rattanapisit and co-workers used a plant expression system (
 <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> Domin) to develop and characterize the rapid production of recombinant RBD as a biopharmaceutical capable of neutralizing viral entry by specifically binding to ACE2 (
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">Rattanapisit et al., 2020</xref>). Such use of plants as platforms for recombinant protein production, offers benefit over animal-based platforms in terms of cost and is also advantaged in its flexibility, rapid scalability and safety. The recombinant RBD possibly exhibit 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> neutralization activity similar to recently developed capsid-like particle-based vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 invasion (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Fougeroux et al., 2021</xref>), and may represent another turning point for COVID-19 therapeutics.
