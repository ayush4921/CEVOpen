<p>To date, ACE2 receptor is the major known entry point for SARS-CoV-2 into human cells. The virus uses its spike protein in attaching to ACE2 receptor of susceptible cells. This would mean that a COVID-19 vaccine could be developed based on the spike protein sub-unit of SARS-CoV-2. In this regard, Tan and Colleagues have recently described a new vaccine candidate immunogenic against SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD, with demonstrated stability at ambient temperature; reducing cold-chain dependence (
