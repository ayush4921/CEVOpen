<p>Although coronaviruses target the respiratory tract, they can also affect the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, kidney, central nervous (CNS) and cardiovascular (CV) systems (

Their systemic effects manifest as lesions and multiple organ dysfunctions especially in immunocompromized patients and the elderly with already existing history of chronic ailments like cancer, CNS disorders, and diabetes. Similarly, the organs that are predominantly affected by SARS-CoV-2 express high levels of ACE2, meaning that such organs, due to ACE2, have high affinity to SARS-CoV-2 reception (
