<p>One of the key signaling pathways that acts as a homeostatic regulator for the cardiovascular system is the RAS. Irrespective of an individual’s health status, RAS maintains a dynamic control of vascular function. This is achieved through different regulatory components and effector peptides such as the carboxypeptidase, ACE2, which converts angiotensin II to a vasodilator, angiotensin (1–7) through the ACE2/Ang one to seven axis (
