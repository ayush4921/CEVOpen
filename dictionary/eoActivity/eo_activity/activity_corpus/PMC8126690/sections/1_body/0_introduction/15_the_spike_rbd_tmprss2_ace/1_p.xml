<p>The SARS-CoV-2 fusion and entry, which is characteristic of COVID-19, marks a phytomedicinal target for COVID-19 therapy. Following SARS-CoV-2 spike-RBD attachment to the host cell ACE2 receptor, the membrane bound activator protease, TMPRSS2, cleaves the viral spike protein and facilitates its fusion with the host cell membrane (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Hoffmann et al., 2020</xref>). This constitutes the Spike-RBD/TMPRSS2/ACE2 axis and the cleavage (or priming) that occurs at the junction between subunit one and two of the spike protein precedes internalization. The Spike-RBD/TMPRSS2/ACE2 axis presents several interventional targets for natural products at the 1) receptor binding motif (RBM) of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike glycoprotein, 2) ACE2 receptor active site that recognizes the RBD and 4) TMPRSS2 protease (
