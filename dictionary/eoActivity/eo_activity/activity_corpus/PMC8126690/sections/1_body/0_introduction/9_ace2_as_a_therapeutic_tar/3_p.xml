<p>Furthermore, Kuba and colleagues demonstrated that a downregulation of ACE2 protein by SARS-CoV leads to severe lung injury in laboratory mice (

By implication, this could mean that excessive administration of soluble ACE2 proteins would not only counteract the scenario of cell viral entry but also maintain the physiological activity of ACE2, including protection against lung injury via negative RAS regulation (

 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Khan et al., 2017</xref>). Recombinant ACE2 sequesters circulating viruses, thereby preventing the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike and endogenous ACE2 proteins. This effect allows endogenous ACE2 protein to negatively regulate the RAS, thereby preventing tissue injury as seen in COVID-19 (
