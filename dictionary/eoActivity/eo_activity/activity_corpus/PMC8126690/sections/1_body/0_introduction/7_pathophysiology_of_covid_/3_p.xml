<p>Should the invasion continue, the virus may gradually infiltrate and infect the circulating immune cells which carry it to other organs like the digestive tract, (i.e. stomach, duodenum, colon, and ileum) displaying inflammatory changes by attacking the epithelial cells of the mucous membrane of ileum and colon (

Autopsy under high-resolution electron microscopy has shown that the virus replicates rapidly in intestinal tissue, thereby preventing the ACE2 from carrying out its functions in amino-acid balance, intestinal inflammatory response, homeostasis of the intestinal microbiota and regulatory expression of antimicrobial peptides. Consequently, a secondary infection by bacteria may also affect the weakened intestine, since ACE2 has been hindered from regulating the intestinal microbiota (
