<p>Naturally occurring fatty acids have been previously reported to have health benefits in several disease states. Omega-3 FA, fixed oils, oils obtained from nuts, coconut, soy, sesame, and fruits are common sources of naturally occurring FA. Omega-3 FA are a class of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) that are known to have beneficial effects in the prevention and management of various diseases (

Ulu and co-workers have shown that diet rich in omega-3 FA attenuated inflammation in angiotensin-II dependent hypertension by up-regulating the ACE2 activity (
