<p>Unlike other coronaviruses that explore several receptors, like aminopeptidase N and dipeptidyl peptidase four in addition to ACE2 in gaining entry into cells during infection, SARS-CoV-2 exploits only the ACE2 protein for cell entry and subsequent viral replication (
 <xref rid="B144" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). The N-terminal region of the ACE2 receptor is anchored by the spike glycoprotein (S1) of SARS-CoV-2. Following receptor binding, SARS-CoV-2 employs some of the host proteases for spike protein priming. These include cathepsin L, cathepsin B, trypsin, factor X, elastase, furin, and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) (

Being the major point-of-entry for SARS-CoV-2, the ACE2 protein expression on respiratory epithelial cell surfaces is critical for the pathogenesis of COVID-19 in individuals exposed to the virus. The vulnerability of the lungs to SARS-CoV-2 infection is premised on two facts; the large surface area of the lungs and the vast expression of ACE2 proteins on the type 2 pneumocytes of the alveoli in the lungs (
