<p>Furthermore, evidences have indicated that the egg-white-derived antihypertensive peptide Ile-Arg-Trp induces the expression of ACE2 and decreases proinflammatory gene expression in mesenteric arteries of spontaneously hypertensive rats (

 <italic>in vivo</italic> study had further demonstrated that the tripeptide IRW elicits vasorelaxation and abolishes vascular inflammation by increasing the levels of circulatory ACE2 and Ang (1â€“7), potentiating its protective activity. (

Findings from these studies demonstrate the previously established beneficial effects of food-derived proteins and other components in modulating ACE2 activity that subsequently influences the body physiology in a way that could antagonize the development of COVID-19. Though these peptides for intake may be largely acceptable due to natural source, a minimal tissue bioavailability of most peptides limits theirs use as therapeutic agents (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Campos et al., 2011</xref>). To address this, approaches like microencapsulation, use of enzyme inhibitors, may be needed to achieve effective oral delivery. Further 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies are also needed to understand the immune response to peptides and human trials may become necessary to validate efficacy. However, the production of such synthetic bioactive peptides faces limitations in expense and requires newer low-cost innovations.
