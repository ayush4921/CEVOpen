<p>The most detrimental of all possibilities is damage to the CNS, when the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid contaminates the cerebrospinal fluid of the spinal cord and brain stem. Using the neuronal pathway, i.e., motor and sensory neurons, it streams via the nerves of the olfactory lobe of the nasal cavity to the brain. In fact, the use of motor proteins, kinesins and dynein, prominent to these neuronal pathways is essential for viral migration. The olfactory lobe, a part of the brain that translates smell responses, is the starting point of dysfunction. This partly explains the early signs of inability to smell, i.e. anosmia (

Additionally, since the brain stem controls vital functions including blood pressure, heart beat and reflex actions like respiration, viral perforation of the brain stem eventually results in multiple organ dysfunctions. The development of intracranial infection may result in confusion, headache and epilepsy. Also, more serious complications, such as obstruction of cerebral blood flow, brain swelling, and coma could also occur. These are mostly mediated by interleukins (such as IL-6, IL-12, IL-15) and tumour-necrosis factor (TNF) in the brain, indicating an inflammatory response (
