<p>ACE2 is known to counter the vasoconstrictive and other detrimental effects of the Angiotensin-1/ACE/Angiotensin-II/AT-1 Receptor axis which is a component of the RAS. ACE2 converts angiotensin-1 and -II into angiotensin one to seven, which acts on Mas receptors. This shunt represents the renin angiotensin system suppressive axis called “ACE2/Ang 1–7/Mas receptor axis,” which produces vasodilatory and other beneficial effects that represent the protective effect of ACE2 on the body (

As stated earlier, the fusion of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 and its subsequent entry downregulates the levels of ACE2 thereby potentiating the detrimental activity of RAS. This makes the RAS an important marker to look at when testing possible COVID-19 therapies. Currently, a Tomeka® Prevention Trial (TPT) is underway in DR Congo to assess the effect of using Tomeka® regimen for COVID-19 on markers of the RAS such as angiotensin-II and -(1–7) (
