<p>The African and Asian regions are famous for their ethnomedicinal herbs (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Ethnomedicinal policies are developed following the demanding use of ethnomedicines. In turn, these policies offer goals and objectives to governments for the development and support of ethnomedicines and may include guideline principles related to safety and efficacy (

 <xref rid="B130" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2019</xref>). The uniform rise in incidence of COVID-19 in regions of lower ethnomedicinal policies hints to a possible link between ethnomedicinal use and COVID-19 incidence. Despite the number of reasons put forward to explain the relatively mild emergence of COVID-19 in regions like Africa compared to America and Europe (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Lalaoui et al., 2020</xref>), no involvement of ethnomedicinal use has been suggested until now. Possibly, ethnomedicinal plants contain bioactive compounds that contribute to prevent or mitigate SARS-CoV-2 invasion via interactions with ACE2-mediated viral tropism (fusion and entry).
