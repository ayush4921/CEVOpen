<p>Furthermore, coumarins, which are naturally occurring phenolic compounds, have also shown ACE2 modulatory properties. An

 <italic>in vivo</italic> study showed that the prenylated coumarin, osthole, mitigates inflammation and acute lung injury in mice by preventing ACE2 and Ang (1–7) down-regulation, resulting in a lowered release of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) (
