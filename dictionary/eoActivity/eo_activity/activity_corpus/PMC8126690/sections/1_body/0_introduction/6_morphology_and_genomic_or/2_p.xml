<p>The SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA has approximately 30 kb in size and is made up of 13–15 (12 functional) open reading frames (ORFs) that are arranged in 5–3′ order of appearance. The first ORF from the 5′ end comprises approximately 67% of the genome and encodes several non-structural proteins. On the other hand, the remaining ORFs encode both accessory and structural proteins, including the major S, E, M, and N proteins (

The M and E proteins are required for virus morphogenesis, assembly and budding, while the S glycoprotein is a fusion viral protein comprised of two subunits; S1 and S2. The S1 subunit is made up of signal peptide, N-terminal domain (NTD) and a receptor-binding domain (RBD) (

The S2 subunit contains two heptad-repeat regions known as HR-N and HR-C, which form the coiled-coil structures surrounded by the protein ectodomain. Importantly, the S protein in its native form is coated with polysaccharide molecules, a property that partly enables SARS-CoV-2 to evade surveillance of the host immune system during entry (
