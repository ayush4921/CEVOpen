<p>Flavonoids are widely found in a variety of fruits and vegetables, including citrus fruits and tomatoes (

In fact, several studies have previously implicated some flavonoids to possess inhibitory properties against ACE2 activity. For instance, a previous

Notably, as is highlighted later in this review, flavonoids like naringenin, naringin, nobiletin, hesperidin, hesperetin, neo-hesperidin, pinocembrin, quercetin, myricetin, and kaempferol have shown potential ACE2 binding affinity toward the residues that contact S protein of SARS-CoV-2 (
