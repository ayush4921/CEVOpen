<p>At this time, several claims have been made on herbal-based traditional medicines or phytomedicines as remedies to COVID-19. These herbs and products include COVID organics (Madagascar), claims on

 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> L.), a Sri Lankan herbal drink, and some Tanzanian claims about recipes from lemon grass, ginger, and neem leaves. Notably, like synthetic agents for COVID-19 such as remdesivir, dexamethasone and chloroquine, some of these herbs and products are recently being supported by preliminary evidence and have been suggested for further empirical assessments (

With a focus on identifying and supporting the development of plant products having some level of scientific evidence in the context of ACE2-centered SARS-CoV-2 fusion-entry, we describe three classes of phytomedicinal agents, based on the target used to modulate viral tropism (virion fusion and entry) along the Spike-RBD/TMPRSS2/ACE2 axis. These phytomedicinal agents include those that may 1) interfere with host cell surface proteins (ACE-2 receptor and TMPRSS2 protease), 2) interface with viral spike glycoprotein, or 3) interrupt spike-RBD/ACE2 interaction
