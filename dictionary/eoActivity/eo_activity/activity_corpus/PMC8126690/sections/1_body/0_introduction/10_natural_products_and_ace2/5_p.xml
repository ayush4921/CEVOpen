<p>With regards to alkaloids, a recent study has highlighted that cepharanthine, a naturally occurring alkaloid¸ can bind to spike protein and inhibit the viral interaction with ACE2 protein

Also, evidence had shown that a natural anthraquinone, emodin, significantly inhibits the infectivity of S protein-pseudotyped retrovirus to Vero E6 cells by binding to ACE2 protein and blocking the SARS-CoV S protein from binding to ACE2 at a 50% minimum inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) of 200 μM (
