<p>Given the global burden and challenge posed by the pandemic and the urgent need for the rapid development of efficient, safe, cost-effective, and readily available prevention and treatment modalities, we turned to phytomedicine. Following the spike of converging evidences, we sought to review evidences related to ACE2 that may suggest the use of phytochemical remedies. Here, we also take a closer look at the SARS-CoV-2 and the indirect phytomedicinal targeting of ACE2 mediated tropism. This aims to provide an indirect evidence for the use of ACE2 interactive phytochemicals, singly or combined, for preventing and mitigating COVID-19, its symptoms and clinical co-morbidities. Notably, the influence of ethnomedicines on ACE2 modulation is not an exclusive factor in determining the rate of spread of COVID-19, but a highlight that identifies what logical next steps can be developed based on existing research. This will benefit investigators in quest for remedies from phytomedicine.</p>
