<p>Studies suggest that 1) resveratrol from grape skins, 2) ripladib from the leaf extracts of the native bryoni, and 3) withanone from Indian ginseng, can selectively bind and inhibit both RBD and ACE2 (

Moreover, multiple ligand activity on the said axis indicates a higher likelihood of getting some potent alternative for COVID-19.
