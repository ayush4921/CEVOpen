<p>The protease cleavage site between the S1/S2 subunits of the spike protein bears an arginine-arginine-alanine-arginine (RRAR) sequence (

 <bold>.</bold> What is now known is that furin, a proprotein convertase enzyme, performs cumulative role with TMPRSS2 by pre-activating this site, aiding viral entry (

 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">Shang et al., 2020</xref>). One molecular simulation study suggests that saikosaponins interact significantly with the arginine residues of the cleavage site to prevent S1/S2 protein cleavage, hindering the virion-cell fusion and viral entry (
 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">Sinha et al., 2020b</xref>). Indeed, the furin pre-activation of spike protein facilitates viral entry particularly in cells with low levels of expressed TMPRSS2 (

Indeed, some proteinaceous plant products (peptides) and metabolites (flavonoids such as rutin, naringin, methylhesperidin and baikalin), have exhibited anti-protease potencies and have been implicated for disease treatment (

The ACE2 domain that is shed off retains some enzyme activity and can convert angiotensin II to angiotensin 1â€“7 (

 <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">Williamson and Kerimi, 2020</xref>). Hence, a closer look into the ability of plant-based ligands to upregulate ADAM-17 represents a potential angle for exploration, which may achieve satisfactory outcomes.
