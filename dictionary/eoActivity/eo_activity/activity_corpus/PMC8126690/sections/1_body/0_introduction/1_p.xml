<p>By the end of December 2020, less than a year after it was declared an outbreak, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) had infected over 80Â million people and claimed almost two million lives (

To date (30th, January. 2021), based on a MEDLINE search, due to its severity, over 90,000 papers (and possibly more) have addressed the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). COVID-19 develops after SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into host cells by binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors (

This crucial first step initiates a cascade of events that results in a vicious cycle of virion to cell infection and replication that includes attachment, penetration, uncoating, translation, replication, assembly and release. The fusion to ACE2 receptor and internalization causes down-regulation of the ACE2 receptor, halting its traditional protective functions over the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and potentiating the pathophysiological sequelae of COVID-19 (
