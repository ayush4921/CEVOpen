<p>In this way, finding solutions to COVID-19 is at the core of solving this global pandemic. At present, available pharmaceuticals face numerous limitations in the treatment of COVID-19. The challenges range from safety and side effects to poor efficacy which warrants the search for better treatment modalities (

Vaccines are either undergoing trials (with some concerns) or facing issues of distribution, acceptance or storage, and are a long shot from herd immunity. Meanwhile, in the search for ACE2-centered therapeutics, scientists have uncovered an ACE2 receptor decoy called human recombinant ACE2 (hrsACE2; APN01) (
