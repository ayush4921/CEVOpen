<p>Natural products are of prominence and have been adopted for traditional use across many African and Asian countries. Aside policies and a bundle of other factors, the relatively lesser COVID-19 burden observed in regions of Africa and Asia could be influenced by certain potentiators of self-care such as cost of medication, interest, beliefs, dissatisfaction in synthetic medications and taking responsibility of one’s health, which push toward ethnobotanical use for COVID-19; a scenario where “the kitchen cabinet becomes thy medicine cabinet.” Of concern, the undeniably increasing demand for plant products is occurring globally at a time threatened by plant extinctions; particularly of wild plants due to excess harvest, habitat degradation, specie invasion, low growth, low abundance, and/or susceptibility to disease. This coupled with the fact that at least one potential drug candidate is lost biennially emphasizes the need for conservation and resource management strategies (

Beside the use of plant decoctions, some phytoconstituents previously highlighted, indicate potentially mitigating effects against viral entry by directly or indirectly modulating the ACE2 activity at the Spike-RBD/TMPRSS2/ACE2 axis. This perspective has implications for traditional medicine (TM) and we believe will support and inform ongoing and upcoming investigations on the management of COVID-19. More so, some of the highlighted ligands have been tested in the past and documented to be beneficial across comorbidities which may accompany COVID-19. Perhaps, this lightens the need for further studies before clinical trials. Other benefits including availability, affordability and safety, support the development of these phytomedicinal therapies; a step toward attaining the third united nations sustainable developmental goal - “good health and wellbeing for all.”
