<p>Similar to what was introduced during the 2002/2003 SARS-COV outbreak, a Chinese traditional medicine program challenged its experts with the development of preventive and treatment strategies for COVID-19.

Undeniably, clinically proven therapeutics remain the gold standard for treatment. As such, efforts to engage preliminary and pre-clinically supported herbs of minimal side effects and cost with randomized controlled trials should be considered.</p>
