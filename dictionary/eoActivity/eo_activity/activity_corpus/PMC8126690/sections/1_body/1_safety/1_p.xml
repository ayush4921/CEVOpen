<p>Phytomedicinal agents investigated against the Spike-RBD/TMPRSS2/ACE2 axis have displayed beneficial pharmacokinetic properties when subjected to

 <italic>in vitro and in vivo</italic> experiments are needed to verify results and provide experimental basis for the research and development/promotion of natural antiviral drugs/nutrition. The cytotoxic status of a plant is also an important safety concern. An 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> study showed that geranium and lemon essential oils inhibited the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 at mRNA and protein levels with no cytotoxic effects on human cell (

Thus, further experiments are warranted based on previous research findings and the reported biological safety of these natural compounds. Moreover, these natural compounds may be synthesized and made readily available for immediate testing.
