 <italic>Cutibacterium acnes</italic>. The authors noted that significant differences were observed between the anti-acne activity of plant material collected in different seasons, with the best activity reported for plants collected during the winter period. Proton NMR-based untargeted metabolomic analysis was used to determine the differences in the chemical profiles of samples collected in different seasons. The compound 2-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-5,6,7,8-tetramethoxy-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one was identified in only the winter samples (
