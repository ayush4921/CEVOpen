<p>The use of the word cosmetics comes from 
 <italic>kosmétikos</italic>, an Ancient Greek term. This word can be translated as “skilled in adornment,” with the variant 
 <italic>kosmein</italic> meaning “arrange” or “adorn” and 
 <italic>kosmos</italic> meaning “order”: Further interpretations include “to make for beauty,” especially of the complexion, or beautifying and “done or made for the sake of appearance,” or “correcting defects especially of the face,” primarily it is “decorative” or “ornamental” (

 <italic>kome</italic>s, which means harmony, and was used to attain perfection. Gradually its meaning has changed until it became connected with the idea that was more closely related to the masking, concealing and camouflaging, as true beauty originates from the inner being and could not be created externally. Since primeval time, numerous civilisations have been subjected to the use of herbs as cosmetic applications. Even today, the demand and the utilization of phytocosmetics have increased in the personal care system (

Research into the value and use of plant and mineral resources in cosmetics continued over the centuries evolving into what we consider to be cosmeceuticals. Interestingly, there is a great tendency of consumers to return to the use of herbs/herbal products for various applications to implement a more natural mode of life (
