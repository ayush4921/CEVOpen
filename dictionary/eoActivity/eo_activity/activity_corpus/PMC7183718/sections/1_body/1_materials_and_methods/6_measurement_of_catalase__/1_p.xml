<p id="Par13">Catalase was examined via evaluating the primary rate of disappearance of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, according to the Chance and Meahly [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] method. The reaction mixture, including phosphate buffer (2.5 mL, 50 mM, pH = 7), H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (0.1 mL, 1%) and enzyme extracts (50 µL), was diluted in order to keep the measurements within the linear range of the analysis. The absorbance of the reaction mixtures was recorded at 240 nm via spectrophotometer (Biochrom WPA Biowave II UV/Visible), in which the reduction in the absorbance at 240 nm was because of the reduction of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>. The activity was stated as µmole activity mg
 <sup>−1</sup> protein.
