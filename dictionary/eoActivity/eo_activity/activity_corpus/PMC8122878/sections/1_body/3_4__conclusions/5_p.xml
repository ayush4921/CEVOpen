<p>Similar considerations as for phage-directed attempts to counteract infections and inflammatory conditions could be speculated for the field of carcinogenesis and cancer. Interfering with particular commensals within the intestinal microbiome by phages of different activities and properties, with the result of changing the intestinal microenvironment towards a more pro- or anti-carcinogenic condition, could be an exciting novel field of colorectal and other intestinal cancer research, and of treatment development. In parallel, more specific research on particular dietary compounds, chemical components, and associated modulation of phages that exert controllable, specific effects on the microbiome could open exciting new possibilities to interfere with intra-intestinal conditions in ways to foster anti-carcinogenic, more cancer-preventive environments.</p>
