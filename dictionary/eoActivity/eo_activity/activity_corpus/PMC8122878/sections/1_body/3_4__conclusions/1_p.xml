<p>In conclusion, the present review shows that many dietary compounds and food ingredients display significant bioactivity with documented effects on phages. The dietary compounds discussed in this review can be consumed directly by diet (as in tea or coffee) or indirectly as food supplements. Still, most of the data reviewed and discussed herein pertain to 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> as the, so far, best studied phage target in humans. Although being a common gut commensal, certain serotypes of this species pose a threat to public health regarding severe infectious and (in part systemic) inflammatory conditions as discussed in the Introduction. A few reports up to now even hypothesized particular 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> strains such as those producing the genotoxin colibactin as potential tumor promoters [

 <italic>E. coli</italic> strains in human colorectal carcinomas and even metastases (unpublished data based on genomes published in [
 <xref rid="B166-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>]).
