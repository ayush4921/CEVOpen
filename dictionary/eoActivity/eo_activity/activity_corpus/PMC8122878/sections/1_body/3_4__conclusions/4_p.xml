<p>To better understand how dietary compounds could selectively modulate bacterial infections, we carried out a simulation model (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-13-02036-f006">Figure 6</xref>b). This model shows that a pathogenic bacterium can wipe out a commensal species, but the selective induction of a prophage can then control the growth of the pathogen, reducing the virulence of the infecting species. The model suggests that it could be possible, in principle, to reorganize the microbial network to fight infections and further disease. Experimental data is required to assess the specificity of particular dietary compoundsâ€™ action to, effectively and safely, direct such attempts of specific reorganization.
