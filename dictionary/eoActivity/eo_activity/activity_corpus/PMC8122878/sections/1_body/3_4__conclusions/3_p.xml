<p>Overall, most of the dietary compounds reviewed here, with documented actions towards phages, showed a beneficial effect for the host by interfering with the activity of the pathogens at several levels. Thus, a number of concluding scenaria can be summarized for the putative benefit of nutrients (including the modulation of phages) to human patients and their microbiota (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-13-02036-f006">Figure 6</xref>A): Several nutritional compounds can directly affect the growth of microbial pathogens, but not that of commensals. Also, dietary compounds are able to inactivate particular toxins produced by pathogens, thus reducing fitness of the latter. More importantly, dietary compounds can inactivate virulent phages, modifying the overall equilibrium of the intestinal microbiome. As a result, phages targeting a commensal species that is a competitor to a pathogen can be removed from the niche. The commensal species will then expand and compete with the pathogen, again reducing the latter’s fitness. Finally, dietary compounds might induce prophages present in the pathogen, determining the hosts’ lysis and a wave of active virulent phages, which in turn reduce the pathogen’s population. Combining all of these inhibitory outcomes will reduce the pathogenicity of invading species and for example, help resolve infections or (chronic) inflammatory conditions.
