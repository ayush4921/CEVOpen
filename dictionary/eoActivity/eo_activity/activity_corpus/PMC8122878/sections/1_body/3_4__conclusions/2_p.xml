<p>The main activity of the dietary compounds discussed in the present review includes inhibitory effects on phages due to the alteration of the capsid, with subsequent reduction of infectivity. In other cases, the viral genome is being damaged, again inhibiting the infectivity of phages. However, some dietary compounds are able to induce (as with common salt or gallocatechin gallate) or repress (as with carvacrol) prophages. More importantly, a few dietary compounds display species-specific activities. For instance, stevia apparently acts as an inducer for 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> prophages, but not of those present in 
 <italic>E. faecalis,</italic> whereas propolis displays the opposite actions.
