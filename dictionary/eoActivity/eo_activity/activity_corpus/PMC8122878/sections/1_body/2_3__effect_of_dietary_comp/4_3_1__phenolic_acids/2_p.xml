<p>Potatoes are commonly used as food worldwide, particularly in the Western diet [

 <italic>E. coli</italic> O157 phages MS2 and Av-05 to 5 mg/mL of PPE for three hours in vitro resulted in a 2.8 and 3.9 log10 reduction, respectively [
 <xref rid="B113-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. Hence, Av-05 was more susceptible than MS2 to PPE exposure. The inhibitory mechanism was probably due to interference with the replication stage. Also, tomatoes contain different polyphenols, mainly in leaves and stems. Although the exact composition of these polyphenols varies, gallic acid and chlorogenic acid belong to the most prevalent. Exposure to 5 mg/mL of tomato leaf extract (TLE) for 12 h reduced the infectivity of both MS2 and Av-05; the magnitude of the reduction depended on the tomato subspecies: the 
 <italic>Pitenza</italic> cultivar reduced the infectivity of MS2 and Av-05 by 3.8 and 5 log10, respectively, compared to 0.57 and 1.6 log10 obtained with the 
 <italic>Floradade</italic> cultivar [
 <xref rid="B80-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Even in this case, the inhibitory mechanism was supposed to be linked to viral replication.
