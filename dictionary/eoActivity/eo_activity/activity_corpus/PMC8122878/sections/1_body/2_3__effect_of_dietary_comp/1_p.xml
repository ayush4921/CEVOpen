<p>Several dietary compounds can alter the physiology of phages, as summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-13-02036-f002">Figure 2</xref>. Although many studies showed a connection between nutrition and intestinal microbiome, there are only a few studies that deal with the effects of nutrition on the activity of phages. Seminal work in the 1960 s indicated that amino acids and vitamins had a different impact on the induction of prophage Î» in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> [
 <xref rid="B66-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. For instance, the amino acid cysteine was an inducer, but its oxidized derivative cystine was not. About four decades later, it was shown that essential oils extracted from chamomile, lemongrass, cinnamon, and geranium could greatly reduce the infectivity of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> T7 and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> SA, whereas others (such as angelica, cardamom, lime, and rosemary) affected only the former phage [
 <xref rid="B67-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. A recent study reported how different compounds could selectively activate some viruses but not others in bacterial growth and prophage-induction assays [
 <xref rid="B68-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. This study demonstrated how stevia, a natural sweetener obtained from the Brazilian shrub 
 <italic>Stevia rebaudiana</italic> [
 <xref rid="B69-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], could strongly induce prophages present in 
 <italic>Bacteroides thetaiotamicron</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> but not in 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic>, whereas uva ursi (derived from the shrub plant 
 <italic>Arctostaphylos uva-ursi</italic>), aspartame (a peptide), and propolis (a flavonoid) resulted in the opposite. These data indicate that dietary compounds can modulate the gut virome and, consequently, alter the gut bacteriome.
