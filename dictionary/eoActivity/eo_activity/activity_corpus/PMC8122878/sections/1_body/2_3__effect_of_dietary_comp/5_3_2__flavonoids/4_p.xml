<p>Genistein and daidzein extracted from soybeans could protect the genome of phage φX174 from degradation induced by nitric oxide (NO) or peroxynitrite (ONOO
 <sup>–</sup>). Genistein was more effective than daidzein since a 25 µM solution of these dietary compounds protected about 75% and 45% of the viral φX174 DNA molecule confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis, respectively [
