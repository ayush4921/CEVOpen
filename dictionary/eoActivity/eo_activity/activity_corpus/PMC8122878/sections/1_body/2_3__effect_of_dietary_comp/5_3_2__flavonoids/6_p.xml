<p>In some studies, pomegranate and grape seed juices, which are rich in both flavonoids and phenolic acids, showed an antiviral activity. PJE at a 4 mg/mL concentration displayed a 0.12â€“0.32 log
 <sub>10</sub> reduction upon MS2 infectivity in vitro [

 <xref rid="B92-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. This was in the same order of magnitude of other experiments carried out with pomegranate juice applied for 21 days, which showed a 0.14 log
 <sub>10</sub> reduction in MS2 infectivity. Moreover, pomegranate juice diluted in PBS increased the inactivation to 1.84 log
