<p>Cranberries are fruits imported from North America and traditionally used by native Americans to treat bacterial infections. Investigations showed that cranberry juice could drastically reduce the growth of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> O157 in vitro [
 <xref rid="B126-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. Exposure for one hour to cranberry juice reduced the infectivity of the coliphages MS2 and Ï†X174 by 1.67 and 1.22 log
 <sub>10</sub>, respectively, compared to the 0.05 and 0.29 log
 <sub>10</sub> obtained by orange juice, 0.97 and 1.01 log
 <sub>10</sub> obtained by grape juice, and 1.00 and 2.63 log
 <sub>10</sub> obtained by purified proanthocyanidin [
