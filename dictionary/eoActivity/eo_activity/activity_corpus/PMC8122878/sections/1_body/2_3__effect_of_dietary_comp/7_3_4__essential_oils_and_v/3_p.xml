<p>The oxidized form of vitamin C, dehydroascorbic acid, showed only very limited effects on phage activity and the amount of strand cleavages in ssDNA from phage Î´A was proportional to ascorbic acid concentration and incubation time. It was significantly increased by Cu2+ or hydrogen peroxide [

 <xref rid="B103-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>] can have an impact on the phage population in the intestinal microbiome, but could also have implications in other fields such as the application of high-dose ascorbate in tumor patients. Towards this end, tumor entities like non-small-cell lung cancer and glioblastoma seem to be vulnerable towards the disruption of their intracellular iron metabolism and oxidative damage caused by the formation of hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals [
