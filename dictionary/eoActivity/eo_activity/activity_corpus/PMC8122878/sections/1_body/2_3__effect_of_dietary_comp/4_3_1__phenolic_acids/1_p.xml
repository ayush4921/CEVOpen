<p>Roasted coffee, but not freshly brewed coffee, has been shown to induce the prophage λ in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> [

 <xref rid="B110-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. Therefore, one hypothesis to explain this is that the compounds produced during the roasting process of coffee beans, such as aliphatic carbonyls or volatile substances [
 <xref rid="B73-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], can cause DNA damage that, in turn, initiates a stress response and the consequent induction of λ prophages. The DNA damage also would explain why the viral progeny, whose genome is a linear double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecule, displays a reduced level of infectivity.
