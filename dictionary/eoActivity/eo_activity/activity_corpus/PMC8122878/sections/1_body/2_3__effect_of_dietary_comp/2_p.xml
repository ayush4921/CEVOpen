<p>Experiments measuring the effect of dietary compounds on phage activity have been based on few classes of compounds, mainly polyphenols. These are molecules that contain one or more phenolic aromatic rings (benzenes with hydroxide moieties). Polyphenols can be subdivided into phenolic acid derivatives and flavonoids [

 <xref rid="B71-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Tea, the second most frequently consumed beverage after water, is a primary source for gallic acid [

 <xref rid="B73-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], contains chlorogenic acid (a combination of caffeic acid and quinic acid) [

 <xref rid="B75-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. They are currently being investigated for their anticancer activity [
