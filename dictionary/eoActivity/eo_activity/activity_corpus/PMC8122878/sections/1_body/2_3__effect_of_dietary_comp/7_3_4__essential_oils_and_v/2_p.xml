<p>After a lag phase of few minutes, ascorbic acid (also known as vitamin C), reduced the infectivity of several phages: δA and φX174 (with a genome of ssDNA); T7, P22, D29, and PM2 (dsDNA); and MS2 (ssRNA) in vitro [

 <xref rid="B106-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. Supplementation of ascorbic acid with oxidants such as oxygen and hydrogen peroxide enhanced this effect, whereas antioxidants (for instance thiol compounds), nitrogen gas bubbling, or chelating agents suppressed it [
 <xref rid="B102-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. It was postulated that the autoxidation of ascorbic acid produced hydrogen peroxide that damaged the genome of the phages, even though Murata and colleagues found that hydrogen peroxide produced by autoxidation of ascorbic acid did not exert effects on activity of phage δA, in contrast to free radical intermediates [

Thus, the scavenging activity provided by thiols and chelating agents was hypothesized to reduce the damage on the viral genome, and the initial delay in the activity of ascorbic acid was interpreted as the time required to internalize this hydrogen peroxide inside the capsid [
 <xref rid="B102-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Subsequent in vitro studies confirmed this hypothesis and showed that ascorbic acid caused the accumulation of nicks in both DNA and RNA genomes, with double-stranded genomes being less affected than single-stranded ones [

 <xref rid="B103-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. In these studies, the overlap of the nicks determined the formation of double strands breaks, which in fact sometimes appeared after the nicks as a result of the stochastic overlapping of the single-stranded lesions. Furthermore, these damages could be restored by the host’s cellular DNA repair system [
