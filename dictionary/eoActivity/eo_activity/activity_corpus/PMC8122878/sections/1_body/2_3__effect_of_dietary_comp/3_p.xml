 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-13-02036-f005">Figure 5</xref>. A summary of the activities identified is given in 
 <xref rid="cancers-13-02036-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The most common outcome of exposure to a given nutrient is a loss of infectivity; this is measured by comparing the plaque-forming units (PFU) of a control and an exposed suspension (measured in mL) of phages. If the control and the exposed suspensions showed, for instance, 10
 <sup>10</sup> and 10
 <sup>9</sup> PFU/mL, then the reduction is said to be one log
 <sub>10</sub>. Herein, we will report the results using this notation.
