<p>Tea extracts were able to inactivate the 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> phages Felix 01 and P22, without affecting the growth of the bacterial host [
 <xref rid="B84-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Exposure to 35 mg/mL of catechin for 24 h reduced the infectivity of the coliphage T4 by over two log
 <sub>10</sub> in vitro, whereas the host did not show any reduction in population [
 <xref rid="B86-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. In addition, derivatives of catechins extracted from green tea could inhibit prophage induction. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) decreased the expression of 
 <italic>Stx1</italic> but increased that of 
 <italic>Stx2</italic> in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> O157 [
 <xref rid="B87-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Since the expression of these two toxins is associated with the induction of 933 W in a germ-free mouse model [
 <xref rid="B120-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>], it needs to be assumed that, in this situation, EGCG is able to act as a virus inhibitor. The mechanism of action of EGCG involves the repression of the bacterial gene 
 <italic>recA</italic> [
 <xref rid="B87-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>], an effector of the stress response that is central in the induction of 933 J, whereas the induction of 933 W relies on additional pathways not related to the expression of 
 <italic>recA</italic>. This difference explains why only 
 <italic>Stx1</italic> was reduced upon exposure to EGCG. This nutrient is believed to cause membrane damage that affects the growth of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> O157 and triggers stress response [
 <xref rid="B87-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Other studies suggested that 
 <italic>Stx1</italic> was still produced upon stimulation with EGCG and gallocatechin gallate (GCG), but the toxin’s extracellular release from 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> O157 cultured at 37 °C for 24 h was hampered, probably due to both the galloyl and the hydroxyl moieties of these compounds [
