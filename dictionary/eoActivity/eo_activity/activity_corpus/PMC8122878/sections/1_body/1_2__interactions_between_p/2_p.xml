<p>Phages can also modulate the bacterial population, indirectly. It is well known that bacteria must undergo a fierce competition within each ecological niche, and, therefore, some species have developed virulence factors to improve their chances of survival [
 <xref rid="B56-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Moreover, the microbial competition is complex and difficult to predict. For instance, 
 <italic>Lactobacillus delbrueckii</italic> and 
 <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> inhibit 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> O157, but 
 <italic>L. plantarum</italic> suppresses the commensal strains of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> but not O157, and 
 <italic>L. paracasei</italic> does not constrain 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> at all [
 <xref rid="B57-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In addition, the suppression of one species might cause the unexpected expansion of a species not apparently associated with the suppressed one. For instance, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> fosters the growth of 
 <italic>B. fragilis</italic> but represses 
 <italic>B. vulgatus</italic>. Knocking down 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> by phage T4 is, therefore, followed by a contraction of the prevalence of 
 <italic>B. fragilis</italic> and an increased growth of 
 <italic>B. vulgatus,</italic> but also of 
 <italic>Proteus mirabilis</italic> and 
 <italic>Akkermansia muciniphila</italic> [
 <xref rid="B58-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. It is also known that commensal species can neutralize toxins, reducing the fitness of the pathogens. For instance, surface proteins of 
 <italic>L. plantarum</italic> can neutralize Stx, reducing the cytotoxicity (and, thus, the fitness) of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> O157 [
 <xref rid="B59-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Therefore, the alteration of even one species due to phagial predation can have drastic consequences for the microbiome.
