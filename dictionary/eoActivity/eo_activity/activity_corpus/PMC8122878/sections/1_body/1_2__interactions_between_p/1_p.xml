<p>Phages were first described by the French-Canadian Félix d’Hérelle, of Institute Pasteur in 1917, who also defined the term ‘bacteriophage’ (“eater of bacteria”). As a first, pioneering phage-based therapy, he applied bacteriophages to treat

Once the progeny virions have assembled in a sufficient number (the burst size), the cell bursts open, releasing the new phages in the surrounding environment. Lysogenic phages have an additional phase: they can integrate as prophages in the bacterial chromosome and undergo a latency period where only a viral transcription suppressor is produced actively. In particular contexts, such as bacterial starvation or DNA damage, the suppression control is relieved, and the prophage enters the lytic phase. Conversely, in the presence of a high number of infected bacteria, phages exit the lytic phase and initiate lysogeny [
