<p>Mounting evidence suggests that phages have access to eukaryotic (and human) cells [
 <xref rid="B60-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Even though tissues are expected to be sterile, it has been known for decades that an ingestion of phage preparations during phage therapy is followed by a recovery of phages in human urine and blood within a few minutes from the administration [

 <xref rid="B62-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. This recovery implies that the viruses had somehow crossed the gastrointestinal barrier. Recent virome studies have identified genes belonging to phages in both blood and brain [
