<p>We speculate that a better understanding of how phages are activated or inhibited in the human gut might be pivotal in modulating the intestinal microbiome, e.g., to counteract bacterial infections, inflammatory conditions, and even carcinogenesis and cancer progression. Such indirect antibacterial activity is a particularly relevant feature in light of the urgent need to identify alternatives and additional strategies to antibiotics to defeat (therapy-resistant) bacterial infections. The present review will summarize the current knowledge on the effect of dietary compounds on phages, their activity, and infectivity.</p>
