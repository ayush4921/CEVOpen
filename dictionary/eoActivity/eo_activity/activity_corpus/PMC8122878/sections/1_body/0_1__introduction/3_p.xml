<p>In the last few years, phages have become a crucial topic in the medical and microbiological fields because these viruses can be used as a treatment of bacterial infections in the context of the rising problem of antibiotic resistance [

 <xref rid="B20-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. As our understanding of phage biology increases, the applications of phage therapy also expand. Phages have been applied to treat bacterial infections ever since their discovery, and phage therapy is becoming more and more popular in fields ranging from dentistry to medical microbiology [

 <xref rid="B25-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. For example, phages are currently being evaluated to fight infections in poultry that are still an economic and health issue [

For instance, it has been proposed that phage T4 might be used as a co-treatment for COVID-19 because this phage reduces the immune response, which is an important contributor to the fatality associated with this disease [
