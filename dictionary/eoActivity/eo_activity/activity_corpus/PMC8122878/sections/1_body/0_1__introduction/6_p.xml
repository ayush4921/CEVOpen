<p>The main STEC derived virulence factor is shiga-like toxin (Stx), which is encoded by the prophages 933 J (
 <italic>Stx1</italic>) and 933 W (
 <italic>Stx2</italic>) [

 <xref rid="B42-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Upon activation, these prophages express

 <xref rid="B44-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Genotoxins, such as cytolethal distending toxins and colibactin, are considered cancer risk factors and can be found in pathogenic 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> strains [
 <xref rid="B45-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Interestingly, many natural compounds have been shown to be bactericidal against pathogens [
 <xref rid="B46-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], and to suppress the biological activity of toxins, including the cholera and ricin toxins [

 <xref rid="B49-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Peas showed to bind with high efficiency Stx, acting as toxic-scavengers, whereas beans can reduce the intake of Stx [
