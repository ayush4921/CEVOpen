<p>Most of the studies related to the effect of dietary compounds on phages have been focusing on human viruses associated with gastroenteritis. Phages have been used as surrogates for viruses that cannot be easily cultivated, such as norovirus, rather than for studying bacterial virus biology as such. Also, most of the bacteriophage studies so far have been limited to phages infecting

 <italic>E. coli</italic> plays an essential role in human health since certain strains of this species, known as Shiga toxin-producing 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (STEC), are widespread food-borne pathogens. The most prevalent STECs are O157, O26, O45, O103, O111, O121, and O145. These seven serotypes induce diseases ranging from acute diarrhea to hemorrhagic colitis and fatal hemolytic syndrome [
