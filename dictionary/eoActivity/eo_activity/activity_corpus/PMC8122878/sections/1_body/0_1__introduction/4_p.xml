<p>Diet can influence the gut microbiome, and it is actively used as an intervention to reduce the risk of developing diseases [
 <xref rid="B29-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Particular components have been shown to be of benefit in the treatment of even severe disease conditions up to cancer. For example, in own previous studies, it was demonstrated that the plant-derivatives curcumin and artesunate inhibit tumor cell invasion and metastasis, at least in part via regulating the expression of proteolytic enzymes, the molecular cascades involving transcriptional factors and microRNAs, respectively [

Seminal studies in the 1950 s demonstrated the antiviral activity of tannins, which are contained in popular beverages such as tea and coffee, and of acerin, the active component of maple fruit [
