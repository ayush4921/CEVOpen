<p>The impact of the gut bacteriome on the human physiology is currently being investigated and seems to have a significant influence on the development and treatment of various diseases. Collectively, the over one thousand bacterial species residing in the human gut encode 3.3 million genes, expanding the human genome 150 times over [
 <xref rid="B1-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Several studies have demonstrated that microorganisms present in the human gut (the gut microbiome) modulate human physiology at different levels. Intestinal bacteria not only metabolize polysaccharides that would be otherwise indigestible [
 <xref rid="B2-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], but also regulate peristalsis [
 <xref rid="B3-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], help to keep a proper intestinal morphology as it has been shown in a gnotobiotic pig model [
 <xref rid="B4-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], maintain the integrity of the intestinal barrier [

 <xref rid="B6-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], attenuate inflammation [

 <xref rid="B9-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], reduce the virulence of pathogenic species [
 <xref rid="B10-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and even influence the action of anticancer drugs [
 <xref rid="B11-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Although it has been proposed to consider the intestinal microorganisms as symbionts rather than simple commensal species [
 <xref rid="B12-cancers-13-02036" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], our understanding of the dynamics underlying the interactions between host and gut microbiome is still limited [
