  <p>Outcomes of phagial infection of bacteria. A virulent phage (yellow particle on the left) can infect a bacterium (in blue). The replication of the phage leads to lysis of the host cell, releasing the viral progeny (yellow particles on the right). Alternatively, some viral species known as temperate can establish an additional step known as latency. The phagial genome can remain independent from that of the bacterium (pseudo-lysogeny) or become integrated into the hostâ€™s genome (lysogeny). In both cases, the viral expression is kept to a minimum and there is no virion production until several cellular conditions are met. Upon induction, temperate phages enter the lytic pathway and determine the lysis of the host.</p>
