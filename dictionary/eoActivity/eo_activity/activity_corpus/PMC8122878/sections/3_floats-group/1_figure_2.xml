  <p>Summary of actions on phages on dietary compounds. There are three main mechanisms of action of dietary compounds upon phages. A dietary compound can modify the capsid, blocking the infectivity of the targeted phage (capsid alteration). Alternatively, dietary compounds can lead to the degradation of nucleic acids (genome damage). In this case, a phage can infect the host, but there will be neither lysis nor viral progeny. However, DNA damage to the host cellâ€™s genome triggers the induction of prophages (dotted arrows). A final mechanism of action (repression of replication) involves an interference with the replication of the viral genome. Even in this case, there is infection, but no viral progeny is produced.</p>
