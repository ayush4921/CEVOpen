<p>100 µL of dilution of a tincture (1:20 in 50% ethanol) were mixed with 100 µL of FCR, 1500 µL of purified water and 300 µL of 20% solution of sodium carbonate. The mixtures were mixed by vortex and incubation was done at room temperature at darkness for 2 h. Absorbance was measured at 760 mm with using spectrophotometer “Photometry Hitachi U-2810”. Purified water was used as a blank. The test was carried out for the two tinctures in triplicate. The test was performed twice for tincture T2 for the repeatability study of the elaborated analytical procedure. The results were expressed as gallic acid and rutin equivalents: mg eq-gallic acid and mg eq-rutin per 1 L of a tincture and per 1 g of the herbal substance. The curves of gallic acid and rutin hydrate were plotted in the concentration range of 20 to 150 mg/L and 62 to 310 mg/L, respectively. The stock solutions of gallic acid monohydrate (1100 mg/L) and rutin trihydrate (1200 mg/L) were prepared using purified water and 50% aqueous solution of ethanol, respectively. The TPC was calculated using expression C = c × 20 × k, where C is TPC of the tested tincture, c is TPC taken from the calibration curve, 20 is coefficient of dilution of the tincture for testing, k is coefficient for the calculation of rutin trihydrate into rutin (0.919) and 1 for gallic acid. The mean of three measurements was used for each concentration of the reference standard. The kinetics of the reaction for the tinctures 1 and 2 was evaluated by comparing r (√R
 <sup>2</sup>) between the absorbance at 760 nm and the reaction time. r ≥ 0.7 was established as the acceptance criterion [
