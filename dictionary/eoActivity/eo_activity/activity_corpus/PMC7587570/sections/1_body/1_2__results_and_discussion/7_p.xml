 <xref rid="molecules-25-04763-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows the TPC expressed as per 1 L of a tincture and per g of dry weight of the herbal substance depending on the particle size. The obtained results confirmed the influence of the particle size on the TPC: the less the particle size, the higher the TPC in the tinctures or by other words: the smaller the particle size, the more effective is the phenolics extraction. In our studies the TPC was 22.7 mg and 13.0 mg of gallic acid equivalents per 1 g of the dry herbal substance, and 45.63 and 26.16 mg of rutin equivalents per g of the dry herbal substance, respectively, for the tinctures obtained from the herbal substance crushed to 1–3 mm and 3–5 mm, respectively. Hajdari et al. [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-25-04763" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] stated that the concentration of TPC ranged from 68.1 to 102.6 mg caffeic acid equivalent/g of plant dry mass. Ćetkovic et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-25-04763" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] showed that the TPC was 8.36 µg, 969.43 µg, 1358.14 µg, and 96.36 µg of chlorogenic acid equivalent/g of plant dry mass if chloroform, ethyl acetate, 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol and water were used as solvents, respectively, for the extraction of phenolics from the methanol extract. Moreover, Ćetkovic G.S. et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-25-04763" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] showed that 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol extracted phenolics in the most amounts and chloroform did in the least ones. Chrpová et al. showed the TPC was 27.1 mg gallic acid equivalents per 1 g of plant dry mass if water was used as solvent at a temperature of 70 °C for 10 min. Hassanein et al. determined rosmarinic and caffeic acids contents in the ethanol extract: 1.0 and 1.7 mg per 1 g of dry herb of 
 <italic>S. montana</italic> [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-25-04763" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. TPC in the 70% methanolic extract of S. 
 <italic>montana subsp. kitaibelii</italic> herb measured by the Folin–Ciocalteu method was 25.82 mg gallic acid equivalents per 1 g of dry sample [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-04763" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Total phenolic and flavonoid contents in the 
 <italic>S. montana</italic> herb was higher in methanol extract compared to the chloroform one [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-04763" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Therefore, it is almost impossible to compare these results as the different reference standards, solvents, particle size, ratio of drug to herbal preparation, and extraction techniques were used despite the usage of the same method for the TPC determination. It seems that the results obtained in our study are close to the results provided by López-Cobo et al. [
