<p>As can be seen from 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04763-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, the year of the herb collection does not have significant influence on the TFC at a particle size of 3–5 mm while the particle size of 
 <italic>S. montana</italic> herb and extraction mode significantly influence the TFC in the tinctures. It was established that a noticeable decrease in the TFC observed in 14 days that needs further studies in order to set up a period during which chemical processes in tinctures of the herb 
 <italic>S. montana</italic> stop after maceration and the herbal product is ready for releasing from a pharmaceutical factory. Null hypothesis testing was used for the evaluation of differences between two mean values of the TFC per 1 g of the herbal substance obtained for the tinctures which are differed in particle size of the herbal substance, extraction mode, data of the TFC determination, etc. In all the cases the null hypothesis (
 <italic>H
  <sub>0</sub>
 </italic>) was tested that the difference is equal to zero, namely two means were assumed to be the same at 
 <italic>H
  <sub>0</sub>
 </italic> (
 <italic>μ
  <sub>1</sub>
 </italic> = 
 <italic>μ
  <sub>2</sub>
 </italic>). Firstly, the statistical analysis revealed that the TFC in tinctures with a particle size of 1–3 mm is statistically higher in comparison to the ones with a particle size of 3–5 mm (lines 1, 3, and 6 of 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04763-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Secondly, there was no effect of the storage time (7 months) of the herbal substance on the extraction degree of flavonoids (tinctures 7 and 3, line 2 in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04763-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Additionally, the year of the herb collection does not have considerable influence on the TFC at a particle size of 3–5 mm (lines 4 and 5 of 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04763-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Finally, the statistical analysis proved significant difference of the TFC in tincture T5 determined after maceration immediately and in the next 14 days (line 9 of 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04763-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>).
