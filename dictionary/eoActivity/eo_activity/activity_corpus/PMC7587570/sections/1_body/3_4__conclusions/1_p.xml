<p>As a result of the performed studies, the tinctures from the 
 <italic>S. montana</italic> herb were developed by different methods of maceration. It was revealed that the determination of the total phenolic and flavonoid contents could be used for the quality evaluation of tinctures from the 
 <italic>S. montana</italic> herb. The tincture obtained by maceration possessed the highest content of phenolics compared to remaceration. It can be concluded that there is an influence of the particle size (1–3 mm versus 3–5 mm) and extraction mode (maceration and remaceration) on TPC and TFC in the tinctures while the herb storage for 18 months does not influence the TFC in the tinctures of the S. 
 <italic>montana</italic> herb. Rosmarinic, caffeic and chlorogenic acids, rutin and (–)-catechin were identified in the tinctures of 
 <italic>S. montana</italic> using the HPTLC screening method as an additional method to non-specific assay and for distinguishing from related species. The issue of unambiguous identification of luteolin and quercetin in the tincture is controversial because of their low separation by the elaborated HPLTC procedure. Generally, 34 compounds were identified in the essential oil of this plant by GC-MS, and 
 <italic>p</italic>-thymol was dominated (81.79%). The high content of polyphenols in the tinctures and 
 <italic>p</italic>-thymol in the essential oil could point the prominent antioxidant properties and antimicrobial potential of the obtained herbal preparations. Further studies are needed to evaluate the stability of the elaborated tinctures, especially in the first two weeks, and fingerprints of tinctures prepared from 
 <italic>S. montana</italic> herb collected in different time periods, and establish antimicrobial activity and phenolic profile by high performance liquid chromatography. In general, the results of our study can be a basis for the development and standardization of the tinctures and essential oil of 
 <italic>S. montana</italic> herb in industrial conditions. The essential oil and tinctures of 
 <italic>S. montana</italic> could be used as components for preparation of oral liquids, drops and antimicrobial sprays for the treatment of foodborne diseases, infections of the oral cavity and respiratory tract, and wounds.
