<p>The content of TF was calculated using the method described in the European Pharmacopoeia 9.0 [
 <xref rid="B8-antioxidants-10-00465" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Briefly, the sample was extracted with acetone/HCl under reflux condenser; the AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> complex of flavonoid fraction extracted by ethyl acetate was measured spectrophometrically at λmax 425 nm. The content of flavonoid (mean of three determinations), was expressed as hyperoside percentage, and was calculated using the following expression:
 <disp-formula>A × 1.25/m
  <label>(2)</label>
 </disp-formula> where A was absorbance at 425 nm and m was the mass of the extracts to be examined in grams.
