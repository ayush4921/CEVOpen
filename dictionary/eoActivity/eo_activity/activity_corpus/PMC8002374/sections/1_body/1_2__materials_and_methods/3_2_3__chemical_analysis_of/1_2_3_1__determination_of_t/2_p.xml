<p>Total phenolic (TP) content was determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu method: one hundred microliter of methanolic solution of the investigated extract (0.49 mg/mL) was mixed with 0.75 mL of Folin-Ciocalteu reagent that was previously diluted ten-fold with distilled water and allowed to stand at 22 °C for 5 min, after which 0.75 mL of sodium bicarbonate (60 g/L) solution was added to the mixture. After 90 min at 22 °C, absorbance of this mixture was measured at λmax 725 nm. Gallic acid (0–100 mg/L) was used for calibration of a standard curve which showed the linear regression at r &gt; 0.99, and the results are expressed as mg of gallic acid equivalents per g of plant extract dry weight (mg GAE/g DW). The content of TP presented the mean of three determinations.</p>
