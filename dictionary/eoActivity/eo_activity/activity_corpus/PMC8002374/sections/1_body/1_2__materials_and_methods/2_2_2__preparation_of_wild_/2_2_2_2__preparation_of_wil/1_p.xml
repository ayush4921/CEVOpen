<p>Extraction of wild bilberry seeds oil with supercritical CO
 <sub>2</sub> was carried out using a laboratory plant produced by SITEC (Maur, Switzerland). The unit consisted of a CO
 <sub>2</sub> pump (Lewa company, Leonberg, Germany) connected to a pump head cooling device (Julabo GmbH, Seelbach, Germany), an automatic back pressure regulator to control the pressure, a 600 mL extraction basket surrounded by a heating jacket, and two separation vessels S1 and S2, following operating parameters: S1-pressure up to 500 bar and temperature up to 80 °C and S2-pressure up to 100 bar and temperature up to 50 °C. Triple crushed seeds (100 ± 1 g) were loaded into the extraction basket. The filters at the inlet and outlet of the basket were made of sintered metal plates with a pore size of 7 µm. The extraction was performed at a pressure of 300 bar and a temperature of 40 °C. One separation step was used. The CO
 <sub>2</sub> consumption was 60 kg CO
 <sub>2</sub>/kg at the flow of 5 kg/h. After extraction, the oils were stored at −20 °C until analyzed. The extraction yield was 31.2%.
