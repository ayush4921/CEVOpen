<p>In order to perform DPPH assay, method adapted from Brand-Williams et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-antioxidants-10-00465" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] was used. Briefly, 300 µL of test solution and 2.7 mL of 0.04 mg/mL methanol DPPH solution were mixed. Test solution was either extract diluted in methanol (extract was diluted in 5 different concentrations: 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 mg/mL) or wild bilberry seed oil diluted in methanol (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mg/mL). The absorbance was recorded at 517 nm after 30 min incubation at room temperature in the dark, against methanol as a blank. Free radical scavenging activity was calculated against control solution, containing methanol instead of test solution using the formula:
 <disp-formula>DPPH radical scavenging capacity (%) = [(A
  <sub>C</sub> − A
  <sub>S</sub>)/A
  <sub>c</sub>] × 10
  <label>(3)</label>
 </disp-formula>
