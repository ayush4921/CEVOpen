<p>Identification was based on overlay curves and the retention times. After spectra matching succeeded, results were confirmed by spiking with respective standards to achieve a complete identification using the so-called peak purity test and the peaks that did not fulfill these requirements were not quantified. Quantification was performed by means of external calibration with standards.</p>
