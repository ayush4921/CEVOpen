<p>The percentage content of TT was calculated using the method described in the European Pharmacopoeia 9.0 [
 <xref rid="B8-antioxidants-10-00465" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]: Decoctions prepared from the investigated extract were treated with phosphomolybdotungstic reagent in alkaline medium with and without treatment with hide powder. The absorbance was measured at λmax 760 nm. The percentage of tannins (the mean of three determinations) was expressed as pyrogallol (%, 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>) and was calculated from the difference in absorbance of total polyphenols (A
 <sub>1</sub>) and polyphenols not adsorbed by hide powder (A
 <sub>2</sub>), using the following expression:
 <disp-formula>62.5(A
  <sub>1</sub> − A
  <sub>2</sub>) × m
  <sub>2</sub>/(A
  <sub>3</sub> − m
  <sub>1</sub>)
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula> where m
 <sub>1</sub> represented the mass of the sample to be examined, in grams; and m
 <sub>2</sub> mass of pyrogallol, in grams.
