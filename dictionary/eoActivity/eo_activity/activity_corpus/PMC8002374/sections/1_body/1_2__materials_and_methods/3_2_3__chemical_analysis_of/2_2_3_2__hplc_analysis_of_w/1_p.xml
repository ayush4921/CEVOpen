<p>“Fingerprinting” of the investigated phenolic compounds was carried out using 1200 HPLC system (Agilent Technologies) equipped with Lichrospher 100RP 18e column, applying gradient elution of two mobile phases, (phase A being 0.2 M solution of phosphoric acid, and phase B being pure acetonitrile). Flow rate was 1 mL/min, with photodiode-array (PDA) detection (UV at 260, 325 nm, for flavanols and stilbene derivatives at 280 nm), always within 70 min. Best peak separation was achieved using the following combination: 89–75% A (0–35 min); 75–60% A (35–55 min); 60–35% A (55–60 min); and 0–35% A (60–70 min). The concentration of the investigated extract was 50.5 mg/mL and prior to injection, the sample was filtered through PTFE membrane filter. For standards used in the investigation, the concentration were: 0.01 mg/mL for procyanidin B2, 0.15 mg/mL for isoquercetin, 0.26 mg/mL for hyperoside, 0.28 mg/mL for kaempferol-3-O-glucoside, 0.30 mg/mL for neochlorogenic acid and kaempferol, 0.34 mg/mL for gallic and protocatechuic acid, 0.36 mg/mL for quercetin, 0.38 mg/mL for sinapic acid and resveratrol, 0.40 mg/mL for epicatechin and rutin, 0.46 mg/mL for pyrogallol, 0.52 mg/mL for caffeic acid, 0.56 mg/mL for chlorogenic acid, 0.56 mg/mL for ferulic acid, 0.74 mg/mL for p-coumaric acid. The injection volume of standard solutions and also tested extract was 4 µL. </p>
