<p>A slightly modified FRAP assay method by Benzie and Strain [
 <xref rid="B13-antioxidants-10-00465" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] was used to determine the antioxidant power of both wild bilberry isolates. To perform FRAP assay, 100 µL of different solutions, previously used in DPPH assay (diluted extract—1.0 mg/mL and diluted seed oil—1.0 mg/mL) and 3.0 mL of freshly prepared FRAP reagent (25 mL of 300 mM acetate buffer pH 3.6 plus 2.5 mL of 10 mM TPTZ solution in 40 mM HCl plus 2.5 mL of 20 mM FeCl
 <sub>3</sub> × 6H
 <sub>2</sub>O) were mixed. The absorbance was recorded at 593 nm against a blank, containing 100 µL of resembling solvent, after 30 min incubation at 37 °C.
