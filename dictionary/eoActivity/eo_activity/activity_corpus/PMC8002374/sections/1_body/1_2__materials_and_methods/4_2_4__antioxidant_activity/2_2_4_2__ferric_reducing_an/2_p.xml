<p>The FRAP value was calculated from the calibration curve of FeSO
 <sub>4</sub> × 7H
 <sub>2</sub>O standard solutions, covering the concentration range 100–1000 mmol/L and expressed as mmol Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>/g extracts. The FRAP values were also estimated for positive controls (BHT and α-tocopherol) in the same manner. All spectrophotometric readings, in both antioxidant activity assays (DPPH and FRAP) were conducted on Evolution 60 UV/Vis Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).
