<p>The day before the start of the study, basal values of all biophysical parameters were measured at all designated areas (on volar parts of forearms). The participants were told to apply all the samples on defined areas two times a day, (morning and evening) for 28 days. Also, they were informed not to apply any other product on the test sites during the study. The following measurements were performed after 7, 14, and 28 days of application in the morning, before applying the sample preparations. The last measurement took place 2 days after cessation of application of the samples. Each measurement was conducted under precisely defined conditions to which the volunteers were subjected before the measuring (30 min rest with uncovered forearms, at room temperature 21 ± 2 °C and relative humidity 45 ± 3%).</p>
