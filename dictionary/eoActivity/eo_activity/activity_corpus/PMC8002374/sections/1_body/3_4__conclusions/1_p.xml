<p>Traditionally, bilberry leaves were used for the treatment of various health impairments as the consequence of oxidative stress, some of them causing the skin diseases. Although bilberry fruits have been studied as the valuable source of anthocyanins and proanthocyanins, the research focusing on the seed oil fatty composition is scarce. In addition, bilberry seeds and leaves represent the byproduct in food industry. In our work we used the bilberry leaves extract and seed oil to formulate preparation for skin application with the aim to bring the connection between their antioxidant potential, the chemical profile of the abovementioned bioactives, and their beneficial effects on the skin. The presence of chlorogenic acid, isoquercetin, and resveratrol as most abundant phenolic compounds in bilberry leaves extract, and α-linolenic, linoleic, and oleic acids (with the stress on existing favorable ratio of 0.98 for α-linolenic (ω-3), and linoleic (ω-6) acids) in bilberry seeds oil might be responsible for the obtained result, i.e., satisfactory antioxidant potential of both investigated bilberry isolates assessed via two in vitro assays (DPPH and FRAP), yet with leaves extract revealing stronger antioxidant capacity. O/W cream with the investigated wild bilberry isolates as active components revealed the potential to significantly increase the hydration of 
 <italic>stratum corneum</italic> while concomitantly improving the skin barrier function and showing good tolerability and preserved pH value of the skin after application. Adding to these good sensory properties of the formulated cream containing wild bilberry isolates as active principles, such preparation might be potentially used in the skin impairments accompanied by oxidative stress and/or dry skin.
