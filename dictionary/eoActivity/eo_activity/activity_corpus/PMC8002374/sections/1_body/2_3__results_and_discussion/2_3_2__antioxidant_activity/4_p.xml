<p>Antioxidant capacity of plant extracts are generally connected to the presence of hydroxyl groups in the structure of the phenolic compounds that might contribute to the stated activity [

 <xref rid="B27-antioxidants-10-00465" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Also, antioxidant effects might depend on the structure and interaction between extracted phenolic compounds [
 <xref rid="B28-antioxidants-10-00465" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. When it comes to the antioxidant activity of phenolic acids, it depends on the number and positions of the hydroxyl groups in relation to the carboxyl functional group; meaning it increases with increasing degree of hydroxylation. For instance, trihydroxylated gallic acid, detected in the investigated extract, was previously shown to possess a high level of antioxidant capacity [
