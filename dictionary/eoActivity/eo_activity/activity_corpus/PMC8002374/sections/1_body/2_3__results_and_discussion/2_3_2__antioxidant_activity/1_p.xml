<p>To evaluate the antioxidant properties, two different assays were employed to avoid any possible incorrectness in the interpretation of the obtained results regarding the antioxidant properties of the investigated extracts, considering the differences in their working principles. The antioxidant potential of all extracts was evaluated using the DPPH and FRAP tests. The DPPH assay is based on the hydrogen donating capacity to scavenge DPPH radicals, while the FRAP assay is an electron transfer-based test measuring the substance ability to reduce Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> to Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>.
