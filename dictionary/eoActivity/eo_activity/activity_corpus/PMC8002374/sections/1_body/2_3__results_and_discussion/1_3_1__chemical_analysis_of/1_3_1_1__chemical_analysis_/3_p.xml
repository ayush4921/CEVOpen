 <xref rid="antioxidants-10-00465-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) the wild bilberry leaves extract was most abundant in flavones and flavonols, predominantly isoquercetin (14.62 mg/g), followed by rutin (4.73 mg/g), almost equal content of hyperoside and quercetin, and followed by lesser amounts of kaempferol-3-

 <xref rid="antioxidants-10-00465-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The determined content of quercetin in the investigated extract was higher than the results obtained by Hokkannen et al. [

 <xref rid="B4-antioxidants-10-00465" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Kaempferol was detected in wild bilberry leaves extract which was in accordance with the date obtained by Bljajic et al. [
