<p>As the phenolic constituents are generally accepted to be active principles of medicinal plants that possess significant biological properties [
 <xref rid="B14-antioxidants-10-00465" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], especially when it comes to their antioxidant effects, total phenolic compounds (TP), tannins (TT), flavonoid (TF) content were assessed in wild bilberry leaves extract, as initial screening of its chemical profile. TP content was found to be 217.59 mg GAE/g, TT was 9.17%, while the measured TF content amounted 2.15%. Such findings were in good correlation with the literature data, reiterating leaves of wild bilberry to be the rich source of TP and TF on the one hand, and ethanol to be an adequate solvent for the extraction of stated compounds, on the other [
