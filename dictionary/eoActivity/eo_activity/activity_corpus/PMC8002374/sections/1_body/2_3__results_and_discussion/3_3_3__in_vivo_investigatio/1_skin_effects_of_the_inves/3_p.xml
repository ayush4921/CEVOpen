<p>TEWL is a parameter that indicates the permeability and integrity of the skin. Therefore, low TEWL values are linked to healthy and normal skin, while increased values imply damaged skin [

 <xref rid="B43-antioxidants-10-00465" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Application of both investigated creams (WB and P) led to the significant decrease of TEWL i.e., to the improvement of the skin barrier, compared to the initially assessed values at all tested time points (

Also, the observed decrease of TEWL was significant between 7th and 14th day of application of both creams with and without the wild bilberry isolates (WB and P, respectively). Also, on 28th day of the experiment, TEWL decrease after usage of both creams was significant in comparison to the non-treated control site (C). It should be emphasized that even two days after discontinuation of the treatment with both investigated creams (day 30 of the experiment), further decrease of TEWL was observed, which was significant compared to the initially assessed values and non-treated control (C) in the case of both samples (WB and P), and also compared to the last day of application in the case of placebo sample (day 28 of the experiment). However, there was no significant difference in the changes of TEWL between the tested creams at no time point of the experiment. Such finding indicated increase of TEWL to be predominantly attributed to the vehicle [
