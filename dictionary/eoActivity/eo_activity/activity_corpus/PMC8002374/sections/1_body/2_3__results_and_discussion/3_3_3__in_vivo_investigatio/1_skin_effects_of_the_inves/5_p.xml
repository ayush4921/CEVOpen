<p>From the 7th day of measurement, the increase in skin pH after treatment with both tested creams was statistically significant compared to the initially measured values. In comparison with the non-treated control test-site (C), pH changes were statistically significant only on the 30th day after the initial measurement (2nd day after discontinuation of treatment) for both tested samples (

Also, the increase of pH value two days after discontinuation of treatment with WB was significant compared to day 28 of the experiment. However, the measured pH values were in the range of normal skin pH values (4â€“6) during the whole experiment. It is very important to have preserved skin pH value after application of topical preparations, while pH can influence the skin barrier function, thus its change can disrupt the antibacterial protection and homeostasis of the skin [
