<p>Dry, inflexible and damaged skin is not just an aesthetic problem, while 
 <italic>stratum corneum</italic> needs appropriate amount of water in order to fulfill its barrier function, i.e., proliferation and differentiation of the epidermal cells cannot be well regulated without adequate 
 <italic>stratum corneum</italic> hydration. Therefore, moisturizing topical preparations have shown positive effect on the skin, especially dry skin [
 <xref rid="B33-antioxidants-10-00465" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In our study, it was demonstrated that wild bilberry leaves extract and seed oil may influence moisture of the skin. Previously described HPLC analysis of the wild bilberry leaves extract used in our study revealed that it was rich in chlorogenic acid (45.51%), and isoquercetin (14.62%), shown to have some beneficial skin effects. For instance, in addition to being a well-known antioxidant, chlorogenic acid has a role in skin cancer prevention and skin-photo protection [

Further, isoquercitrin from herbal extract revealed a dose-dependent inhibitory action against edema induced by allergic contact dermatitis, in addition to other phenolic compounds including gallic acid, quercetin, and kaempferol, also present in the wild bilberry leaves extract used in this study. Isoquercitrin, isolated from acetone extract of persimmon fruit peel, was also found to be a potent inhibitor of melanin production by suppressing tyrosinase expression in mouse B16 melanoma cells [

Also, in the study investigating wound-healing effects of cream with isoquercetin, there was a significant increase in the percentage of wound contraction and a significant decrease in the period of epithelialization in isoquercetin-based cream-treated groups as compared with the control group. Histological analysis revealed isoquercetin 0.06%

 <italic>w</italic> cream treatment resulted in almost complete re-epithelialization and re-structuring of the wound tissue, alongside a significant rise in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and a decrease in glutathione (GSH) levels in the burn injury group which was reversed to a major extent by the application of isoquercetin-based cream [

In addition to chemical constituents of wild bilberry leaves extract present in the water phase of the tested cream, components from the oil phase as well (originating from the wild bilberry seed oil) might have contributed to its observed moisturizing effects. Namely, it has been shown that after application of emulsions on the skin, evaporation of the greatest percentage of water, known as the evaporation phase, is followed by the phase in which lipids from the emulsion penetrate into the epidermis and lead to increased skin hydration (lipidization phase) [

In this connection, previous studies reported linoleic acid and Î±-linolenic acid, which were found in great amount in the investigated wild bilberry seed oil used in the tested creams, to be safe adjunctive treatments for many skin disorders, including atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, acne vulgaris, systemic lupus erythematosus, nonmelanoma skin cancer, and melanoma [

 <italic>cis</italic>-9, trans-11 isomer of conjugated linoleic acid or a salt or ester thereof to treat or prevent skin inflammation [
