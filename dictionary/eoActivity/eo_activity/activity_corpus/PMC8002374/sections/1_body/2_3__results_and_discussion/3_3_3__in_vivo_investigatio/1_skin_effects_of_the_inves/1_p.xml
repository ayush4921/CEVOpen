<p>The increase of electrical capacitance (EC) after application of both investigated creams (WB and P) indicated their moisturizing effect on skin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-10-00465-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Namely, cream with wild bilberry isolates-leaves extract and seeds oil (sample WB) significantly increased the hydration of 
 <italic>stratum corneum</italic> in all assessed time points, compared to the initially measured values. Starting from the measurement at day 14, this increase was also significant compared to C test-site, where none of the tested creams was applied. Moreover, the increase in 
 <italic>stratum corneum</italic> hydration after treatment with this sample between 14th and 28th day was also statistically significant. On the other hand, the use of placebo cream (P) led to an increase in 
 <italic>stratum corneum</italic> hydration which was statistically significant compared to the initially measured values (before treatment) but not to the NC. The exception was the measurement after the 28 days of treatment with this sample, which was significant in relation to the C, but also in relation to the cream WB. Based on such findings, it may be speculated that the observed significant moisturizing skin effect of cream with wild bilberry isolates is related to the presence of active compounds, and not the vehicle itself. Two days after cessation of use of both tested creams (day 30), there was a significant decrease in hydration compared to 28th day of the measurement. However, this value was still significantly higher than the initially measured one, and in the case of sample WB also in comparison to non-treated control test-site (C).
