The predominant phenolic acids were derivatives of hydroxycinnamic acid was led by chlorogenic acid (45.51 mg/g), followed by caffeic acid, protocatechuic, and p-coumaric acid present in the amount ranking from 1 to 3 mg/g. Determined polyphenol acids, present in the investigated extract, but in lower amount, were neochlorogenic, sinapic and ferulic acid. From the group of derivatives of hydroxybenzoic acid, gallic and protocatechuic acid were identified (
