<p>The identified flavonoids derivatives in the investigated extract, quercetin and kaempferol might provide extremely active free-radical scavenger agents, given that they possess the catechol moiety with double bonds at C2â€“C3 and 3-OH [

Resveratrol, found in the investigated extract, was previously found to possess the strong ability to capture free radicals and this property was related to the presence of three hydroxyl groups, as well as the presence of aromatic rings and a double bond in the molecule [
