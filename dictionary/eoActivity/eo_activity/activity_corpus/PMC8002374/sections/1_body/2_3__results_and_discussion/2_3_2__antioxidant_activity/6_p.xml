<p>Wild bilberry seed oil demonstrated lower antioxidant activity compared to the wild bilberry leaves extract in both in vitro assays (
 <xref rid="antioxidants-10-00465-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). In DPPH test, obtained IC
 <sub>50</sub> for the investigated oil (3.37 mg/mL) was somewhat higher compared to the tested extract (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.13 mg/mL), and BHT (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.07 mg/mL) indicating good antioxidative capacity. As in the case of wild bilberry extract, IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of the oil was quite higher in comparison to α-tocopherol (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.47 mg/mL). On the other hand, FRAP value of tested oil (0.2045 mmol Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>/g of extract) was very low compared to the investigated extract (3.6348 mmol Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>/g of extract), and particularly in comparison to the positive controls (11.3152 and 16.9616 mmol Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>/g of extract for BHT and α-tocopherol, respectively). Nevertheless, detected antioxidant activity of wild bilberry oil assessed using DPPH and FRAP test were higher compared to the data presented in literature [

 <xref rid="antioxidants-10-00465-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). On the other hand, wild bilberry seed oil has lower content of antioxidants such as vitamin E and carotenoids compared to other berry seed oils [
