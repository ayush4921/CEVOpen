<p>GC/MC analysis of wild bilberry seed oil obtained using supercritical CO
 <sub>2</sub> extraction (
 <xref rid="antioxidants-10-00465-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) confirmed high content of PUFAs, i.e., esters of linoleic (ω-6 fatty acid), α-linolenic (ω-3 fatty acid) and oleic (ω-9 fatty acid) acids. Such results are in agreement with the previously reported findings [

 <xref rid="B20-antioxidants-10-00465" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. It has been documented that fatty acids particularly α-linolenic, linoleic, and oleic acids exert beneficial health effects by modulating the signaling pathways regulating inflammatory response, cell differentiation, and proliferation. ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acids play a critical role in normal skin function and appearance [
 <xref rid="B21-antioxidants-10-00465" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Metabolism of linoleic and α-linolenic acid is limited in the skin. They are considered essential nutrients for the skin, influencing the inflammatory response of the skin. ω-6 fatty acids play an important role in the structural integrity and barrier function of the skin, while topical application of certain ω-3 fatty acids lessens UV-induced photo damage, signs of skin aging and inflammatory skin responses [

 <xref rid="B23-antioxidants-10-00465" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Oils abundant in oleic acid are richer and heavier in consistency. They are extra-occlusive and seal in moisture really well. Oleic acid is absorbed well by the skin, has anti-inflammatory and skin softening properties [
