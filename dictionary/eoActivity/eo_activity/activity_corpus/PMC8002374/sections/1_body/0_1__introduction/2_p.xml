<p>In the processing of wild bilberry fruits, certain waste or by-products may be expected, such as leaves, seeds, and peels that are usually underutilized, despite being a rich source of bioactive compounds [

For instance, wild bilberry leaves are reported to be abundant in various phenolic compounds, with flavonoids, phenolic acids, tannins, and stilbenes in higher amounts compared to wild bilberry fruits and consequently, to possess enhanced antioxidant properties [

Although oils are usually extracted from seeds using solvent extraction or cold pressing, these methods have certain disadvantages such as the usage of organic solvents/high temperatures for the former and low yields for the latter. Therefore, in recent years supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) has been used as an alternative method over traditional extraction technologies due to its numerous advantages reflected primarily in a flexible process, allowing production of extracts with desired fractions of chemical constituents, free from polluting organic solvents. One of the most used supercritical fluids is certainly carbon dioxide (CO
 <sub>2</sub>), as it is inert, inexpensive, easily available, odorless, tasteless, environment-friendly, and GRAS (generally regarded as safe) solvent. In addition, its near-ambient critical temperature (31.1 Â°C) makes it ideally suitable for thermolabile natural products [
