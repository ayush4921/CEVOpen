<p>With respect to the above-mentioned, due to their chemical composition i.e., the presence of phenolic constituents and PUFAs, waste products of bilberry fruits production, i.e., leaves and seeds may be potentially used in food or cosmetic industry. Therefore, in this study, the main objective is to investigate the potential of the residues of food products in the topical skin preparations. Hence, we prepared bilberry leaves extract by means of maceration with ethanol as a commonly used technique for the extraction of polyphenolic compounds [

 <sub>2</sub>. Afterwards their chemical composition was assessed using high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) methods, while their antioxidant activity, potentially related to their usage in prevention of oxidative-stress related conditions, including skin aging was tested using two in vitro assays (DPPH and FRAP). Finally, stated wild bilberry isolates (leaves macerate and seed oil) were added into oil-in-water (O/W) cream as active compounds and its effects on the skin were investigated in an in vivo study conducted on healthy human volunteers. Furthermore, evaluation of their sensory characteristics, often decisive for the consumer acceptance being the biggest part of the topical productsâ€™ sales potential [
