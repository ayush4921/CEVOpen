<p>According to the literature [
 <xref rid="B16-plants-09-00375" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], 
 <italic>Glomus lamellosum</italic> inoculation to 
 <italic>L. angustifolia</italic> resulted in a higher increase in plant biomass (46.7%) and essential oil content (57%) compared to the results from the present investigation, which may be connected with differences in AMF species and soil characteristics. The significant contribution of AMF species for optimizing essential oil accumulation was previously demonstrated in 
 <italic>Artemisia annua</italic> [
 <xref rid="B10-plants-09-00375" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]: leaf volatile oil content increased up to 45% and 25% in plants inoculated with 
 <italic>Glomus mosseae</italic> and 
 <italic>Glomus versiforme</italic>, respectively, compared with the control.
