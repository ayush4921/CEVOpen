<p>The values relevant to the root mycorrhizal colonization reported in 
 <xref rid="plants-09-00375-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> are the means of the two determinations performed two months after the transplant and at crop end, as this parameter was stable in the sampled times. AMF occurrence in the roots of the three aromatic species examined was significantly higher under the mycorrhizal-based formulate application, compared to the untreated control, but the inoculation effectiveness was statistically lowest in 
 <italic>Lavandula angustifolia</italic>. Indeed, in the latter crop the beneficial microorganisms did not lead to yield and plant biomass increase, contrary to what was recorded in 
 <italic>Artemisia dracunculus</italic> and 
 <italic>Hyssopus officinalis</italic> (
