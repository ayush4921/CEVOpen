<p>Changes in elemental composition and selective accumulation of specific ions upon AMF inoculation is supposedly a further factor contributing to stress tolerance of the examined aromatic plants. Investigations of AMF effects on macro- and trace-element accumulation in plants revealed an enhanced uptake of nutrients, with particular reference to those characterized by poor mobility in soil (P, Zn, Cu, Fe and Mn) due to the wide AMF hyphae expansion inside the soil [

Despite the growth stimulating effect of AMF, the concentrations of K, Na, Mg and Ca were not significantly different between the AMF-treated and control plants. Notably, an increase in phosphorous content was recorded in tarragon and lavender, but not in hyssop.
