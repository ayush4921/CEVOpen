<p>The data presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00375-f001">Figure 1</xref> indicate different effects of AMF preparation on phenological phases of aromatic plant development. Indeed, 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> and 
 <italic>L. angustifolia</italic> inoculated with AMF demonstrated increased rates of development (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00375-f001">Figure 1</xref>a,b). Conversely, 
 <italic>H. officinalis</italic> showed a slight growth retardation, particularly at the initial stage of development, by 5â€“8 days.
