<p>Up to date, in pot experiments carried out in both open fields and greenhouses, the protective effect of AMF against oxidative stress in plants, along with enhanced plant resistance to a range of stresses, including drought, salinity, herbivore, temperature, heavy metals and diseases, were reported [

Interestingly, the application of abiotic stress to plants after harvesting, such as a high temperature and/or high humidity during storage of vegetable crops grown in ordinary conditions, usually causes degradation of most natural antioxidants, thus worsening plant quality [
