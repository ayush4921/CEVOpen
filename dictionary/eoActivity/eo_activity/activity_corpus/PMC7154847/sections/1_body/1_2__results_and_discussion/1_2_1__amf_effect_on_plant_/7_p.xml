<p>In previous investigations, compared to the untreated control the AMF inoculation effect on aromatic plant antioxidant activity was positive [

 <xref rid="B32-plants-09-00375" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], the latter report referring to non-stressed conditions. In the present research, lavender, tarragon and hyssop crops were grown under appropriate farming practices, and favorable temperature trends were recorded, which may be supposed as the possible reasons why no significant differences in antioxidant activity and phenolic content were found between AMF-inoculated plants and the untreated control (
 <xref rid="plants-09-00375-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Analysis of the antioxidant status of the aromatic plants revealed that at harvest the antioxidant activity in AMF-treated plants did not significantly differ from the control, being in the range of 58.3 to 58.8 mg GAE g
 <sup>−1</sup> for tarragon, 67.9 to 74.7 mg GAE g
 <sup>−1</sup> for lavender and 51.6 to 57.0 mg GAE g
 <sup>−1</sup> for hyssop. The same situation was recorded for polyphenol content: 18.5–18.6, 19.3–19.8 and 15.0–16.3 mg GAE g
 <sup>−1</sup>; in contrast with previous findings relevant to the significant effect of AMF on plant antioxidants synthesis [
