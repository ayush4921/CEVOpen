<p>Despite a slight development slowing, 
 <italic>H. officinalis</italic> demonstrated the highest increase in plant biomass (35.6%), productivity (34.8%) and essential oil yield (33.3%). The latter parameter reached only a 22.4% increase in 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> and 9.3 % in 
 <italic>L. angustifolia</italic>. Though AMF inoculation was reported to elicit plant dry matter accumulation [
 <xref rid="B3-plants-09-00375" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], no statistically significant increase in this parameter as well as of total dissolved solids (TDS) were recorded in the present study (
