 <xref rid="B42-plants-09-00375" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], but the three plants investigated in the present study did not show any significant changes in this element concentration upon AMF application. Smith and Read [
 <xref rid="B42-plants-09-00375" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] also detected an enhanced Zn accumulation in AMF-inoculated plants. In this research, the increase of Zn content was recorded only in tarragon and lavender treated with AMF. A recent investigation of Musz√Ωnska and Labudda [
 <xref rid="B43-plants-09-00375" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] showed the ability of Zn to enhance plant tolerance to abiotic stress, which may be partially connected with the increase in stress tolerance of AMF-treated 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> compared to 
 <italic>L. angustifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>H. officinalis</italic> in the present investigation. Interestingly, the concentration of two other natural antioxidants, such as iodine and selenium, significantly increased in AMF-inoculated 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> plants, showing the highest tolerance to abiotic stress as shown by biochemical analysis (

 <italic>to A. dracunculus</italic> and 
 <italic>H. officinalis</italic>, suggests that AMF application may species-dependently enhance the concentration of this essential element to human beings. Previously, the beneficial effect of AMF inoculation on Se accumulation in garlic, onion and shallot bulbs was reported [
