<p>Forced long-term storage of lavender, tarragon and hyssop at high temperature and humidity during the samples transport from Crimea to Moscow, resulted in dramatic changes in plant quality and appearance (

 <xref rid="plants-09-00375-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The results suggest that, despite non-significant differences in antioxidant activity and phenolic content between the AMF-inoculated and control plants at harvest (
 <xref rid="plants-09-00375-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), the values of the abovementioned parameters significantly increased during storage in AMF-treated plants compared to the control ones, the latter showing an antioxidant-content drop. The highest differences in appearance and antioxidant status between the AMF-inoculated plants and the control were recorded in hyssop, and the lowest in tarragon (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00375-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Antioxidant defense plays a major role in protection against plant biotic and abiotic stresses [

 <xref rid="B39-plants-09-00375" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Data presented in 
 <xref rid="plants-09-00375-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> reveal significantly lower levels of ascorbic acid, chlorophyll, carotenes, phenolics and total antioxidant activity of control plants compared to those inoculated with AMF, which was consistent with the aspect of samples subjected to high temperature and humidity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00375-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Notably, the differences between the control and AMF-treated plants in ascorbic acid content reached 1.66 in 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic>, 3.64 in 
 <italic>L. angustifolia</italic> and 3.31 in 
 <italic>H. officinalis</italic>. Higher levels of chlorophyll content in the AMF-inoculated plants observed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00375-f001">Figure 1</xref> exceeded those of the control plants by 1.24–2.30 times. Phenolic differences between the AMF-treated and control plants of tarragon and lavender reached 1.42–1.51 times, with similar values recorded in control and AMF-inoculated hyssop.
