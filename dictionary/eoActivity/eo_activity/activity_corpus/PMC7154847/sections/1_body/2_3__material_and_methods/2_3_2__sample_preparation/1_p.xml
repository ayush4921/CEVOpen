<p>Plant samples were randomly taken from each plot at harvest and biochemical and elemental analyses were performed on control and AMF-treated plants. Two groups of samples were used: 1) fresh and 2) dry. 1) A fraction of fresh samples in hermetically closed plastic bags was transported by plane (total transport time 8 h) from Crimea to Moscow to the laboratories of the Federal Scientific Center of Vegetable Production, where ascorbic acid, phenolics, photosynthetic pigments and total AOA were assessed. Transport conditions provided significant abiotic stress to harvested plants: temperature in polyethylene bags was about 40 Â°C and relative humidity 95%. 2) The remaining control samples were dried at room temperature in the shade up to a constant weight, and next homogenized and subjected to quality determinations (antioxidants, total dissolved solids and elemental analysis). All the results were expressed per dry weight.</p>
