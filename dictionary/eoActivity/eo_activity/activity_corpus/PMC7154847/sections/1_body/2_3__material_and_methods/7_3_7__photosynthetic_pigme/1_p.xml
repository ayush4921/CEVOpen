<p>Half a gram of fresh leaf sample was homogenized in a porcelain mortar with 10 mL of 96% ethanol. The homogenized sample mixture was quantitatively transferred to a volumetric flask, bringing the volume to 25 mL and the mixture was filtered through filter paper. The resulting solution was analyzed for Chlorophyll-a, Chlorophyll-b and carotene determination through a spectrophotometer (Unico 2804 UV, USA). Calculation of chlorophyll and carotene concentrations was achieved using appropriate equations [
