<p>The ascorbic acid content was determined by visual titration of plant extracts in 6% trichloracetic acid with Tillmans reagent [
 <xref rid="B47-plants-09-00375" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Three grams of fresh leaves were homogenized in a porcelain mortar with 5 mL of 6% trichloracetic acid and quantitatively transferred to a measuring cylinder. The volume was brought to 60 mL using trichloracetic acid, and the mixture was filtered through filter paper 15 min later. The concentration of ascorbic acid was determined from the amount of Tillmans reagent that went into titration of the sample.
