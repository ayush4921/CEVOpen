<p>The effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF)-based formulate application, in comparison with an untreated control, were assessed on plant growth and development; yield; essential oil content and its major components; quality; antioxidant compounds and activity; and elemental composition of the three aromatic species 
 <italic>A. dracunculus</italic> (cultivar Izumrud), 
 <italic>L. angustifolia</italic> (cultivar Record) and 
 <italic>H. officinalis</italic> (cultivar Nikitsky bely). A randomized complete block design was used with three replicates, with the experimental unit surface area of 10 m
 <sup>2</sup>. A further comparison was performed between plants subjected to abiotic stress (40 Â°C and 95% relative humidity) during storage and control plants stored in ambient conditions.
