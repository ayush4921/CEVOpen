<p>In all species investigated in the stage of full flowering, essential oil content in the aerial part of the plants was determined. For this purpose, 50 g of each dry sample were hydro-distilled in a Clevenger-type apparatus for 2 h and then the percentage and yield of essential oils were calculated [

The composition of the essential oil was investigated in a gas-chromatograph “Chromatec-Kristall 5000.2” (Russia) with a mass-spectrographic detector. Volatile components were separated on a capillary column CR-5 ms (5%-phenylmethyl-polysiloxane, 0.25 mm × 30 m; 0.25 µm film thicknesses). The temperature of injector and transfer line were set to 250 and 300, respectively. The oven was heated to 75 °C, and subsequently 4.0 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup> up to 240; the evaporator temperature was −250 °C. The following conditions were adopted: split ratio 1:25, at flow 1.1 mL min
 <sup>–1</sup>, with helium as carrier gas, and injection volume of 1 mL of essential oil diluted in dichloromethane (1:300 v/v). The components of the essential oils were identified by comparison of their retention indices relative to (C
 <sub>8</sub>–C
 <sub>30</sub>) n-alkanes (Sigma-Aldrich, Switzerland) and Supelco analytical standards (USA), and via comparison of their mass-spectra with those of the NIST 14 mass spectra collection (National Institute of Standards and Technologies, USA).
