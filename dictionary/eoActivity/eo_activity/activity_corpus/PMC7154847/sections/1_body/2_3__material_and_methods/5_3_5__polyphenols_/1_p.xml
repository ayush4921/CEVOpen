<p>Polyphenols were determined in ethanol extract using the Folin–Ciocalteu colorimetric method as previously described [
 <xref rid="B48-plants-09-00375" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. One gram of dry leaf powder of the aromatic plants was extracted with 20 mL of 70% ethanol at 80 °C over 1 h. The mixture was cooled and quantitatively transferred to a volumetric flask, and the volume was adjusted to 25 mL. The mixture was filtered through filter paper, and 1 mL of the resulting solution was transferred to a 25 mL volumetric flask to which 2.5 mL of saturated Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> solution and 0.25 mL of diluted (1:1) Folin–Ciocalteu reagent were added. The volume was brought to 25 mL with distilled water. One hour later the solutions were analyzed through a spectrophotometer (Unico 2804 UV, USA), and the concentration of polyphenols was calculated according to the absorption of the reaction mixture at 730 nm. As an external standard, 0.02% gallic acid was used.
