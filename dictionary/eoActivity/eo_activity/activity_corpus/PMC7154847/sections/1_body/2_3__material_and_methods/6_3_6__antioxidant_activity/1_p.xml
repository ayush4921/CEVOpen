<p>The antioxidant activity of the aromatic plants investigated was assessed using a redox titration method [
 <xref rid="B49-plants-09-00375" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] via titration of a 0.01 N KMnO
 <sub>4</sub> solution with the ethanolic extract of the plants. The reduction of KMnO
 <sub>4</sub> to colorless Mn
 <sup>+2</sup> in this process reflects the quantity of antioxidants dissolvable in 70% ethanol. The values were expressed in mg gallic acid equivalents (mg GAE g
 <sup>âˆ’1</sup> dw). In recent years, the method gained great popularity between biochemists due to simplicity and cheapness [
