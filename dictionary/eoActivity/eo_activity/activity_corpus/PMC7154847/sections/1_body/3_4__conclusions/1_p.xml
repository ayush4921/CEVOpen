<p>AMF inoculation of 
 <italic>A. dracunculus, L. angustifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>H. officinalis</italic> grown in an open field at Nikita Botanic Gardens showed beneficial effects on plant growth, development and essential oil content, though high intraspecies variability in elemental composition was recorded. Moreover, the application of AMF to plants during storage under abiotic stress, i.e., high temperature and humidity, has proved a promising method for improving plant quality, even when no beneficial effects were recorded at harvest of crops reared with appropriate farming practices in normal meteorological conditions.
