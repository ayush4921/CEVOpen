<p>Among the modern environmentally friendly technologies for plant production, the utilization of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) is one of the most promising, especially in organic management [

Interestingly, AMF establish symbiotic associations with more than 80% of terrestrial plants, and the rate of their colonization is reportedly dependent on either fungi and plant species or environmental factors (e.g., soil characteristics) [
