<p>Despite the recognized important role of AMF in plant nutrition and growth under organic management, the effect of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on the accumulation of secondary metabolites and mineral composition in plants has not been widely assessed [

 <xref rid="B16-plants-09-00375" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], nutrient intake, element composition, biochemical characteristics, accumulation of essential oil and composition revealed significant variability, caused by both the plant species and AMF strain. Genetic variability in AMF populations was shown to affect host-plant fitness [
