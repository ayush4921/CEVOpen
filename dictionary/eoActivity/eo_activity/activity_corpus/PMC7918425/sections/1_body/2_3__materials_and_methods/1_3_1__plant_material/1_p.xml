<p>The objects of the study were two Origanum vulgare subspecies, i.e.: Greek oregano (
 <italic>O. vulgare subsp. hirtum</italic>; accession numbers: 406734) and common oregano (
 <italic>O. vulgare subsp. vulgare</italic>; accession number: 401204) cultivated at the experimental field of the Department of Vegetable and Medicinal Plants, Warsaw University of Life Sciences (WULS-SGGW) (5210180 N; 2105234 E). The seed material originated from Polish Genebank (National Centre for Plant Genetic Resources: Polish Genebank). The research was carried out on selected clones of the abovementioned accessions (one per each subspecies). The herb (upper, not woody parts of shoots) of both subspecies was harvested in June 2020, from 2-years-old plants, at the beginning of plant’s blooming. Plant material was dried at 35 °C and subjected to chemical analysis.
