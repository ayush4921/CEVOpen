<p>The obtained results show that the antioxidant potential both of Greek oregano and common oregano essential oils and hydroethanolic extracts is similar (

 <xref rid="B9-molecules-26-00988" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], Greek oregano essential oil reveals remarkable antioxidant potential, comparable with Î±-tocopherol and the synthetic antioxidant butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). Such an effect is considered to be related with the predominance of carvacrol and/or thymol in the essential oil. However, other monoterpenes, especially oxygenated ones, can also exhibit significant antioxidant activities [

 <xref rid="B9-molecules-26-00988" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This may explain the similarity in the antioxidant power of Greek oregano and common oregano essential oils observed in the present study. Although common oregano essential oil contained small content of carvacrol and thymol, it was rich in other monoterpenes both oxygenated and hydrocarbons (52.99 and 21.19%, 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00988-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), probably responsible for its high antioxidant potential. These results are in a good agreement with data shown by Vazirian et al. [
 <xref rid="B65-molecules-26-00988" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], where common oregano essential oil, rich in oxygenated monoterpenes, revealed considerable antioxidant activity.
