<p>In the present work, 22 compounds were identified in Greek oregano essential oil, comprising 98.71% of the total identified fraction. In common oregano, 29 compounds were identified, amounting to 99.19%. Monoterpenes, with a predominance of monoterpene hydrocarbons, were the fundamental components of both analyzed essential oils. In Greek oregano, γ-terpinene and 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene were present in the highest amounts within this group. A considerable content of phenolic monoterpenes (39.79%) with a clear domination of carvacrol was also noticed in the case of this subspecies (

 <xref rid="B49-molecules-26-00988" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The chemical composition of analyzed Greek oregano essential oil allowed us to classify the oil as a mixed carvacrol/γ-terpinene/
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene chemotype. It is known that this subspecies creates various pure or mixed chemotypes, where the most common are those with carvacrol and/or thymol as dominant components, as well as γ-terpinene and/or 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene-rich ones. Regarding industrial applications, the pure carvacrol chemotype (with up to 80% of carvacrol) is considered as the most valuable due to proven biological activity of this phenolic monoterpene [
