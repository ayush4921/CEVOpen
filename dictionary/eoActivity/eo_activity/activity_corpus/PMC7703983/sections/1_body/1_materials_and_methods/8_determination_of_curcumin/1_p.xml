<p>For HPLC analysis of curcumin, we used an Agilent Extend C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm) under the following chromatographic conditions: a mobile phase of 4% acetonitrile and glacial acetic acid solution (45:55), a flow rate of 1.0 mL·min
 <sup>-1</sup>, a detection wavelength of 420 nm, a column temperature of 25°C, and an injection volume of 10 μL. The number of theoretical plates was not less than 4,000. The curcumin reference standard was accurately weighed (6.35 mg) after ensuring that it had been dried to a constant weight [CAS: 110823–201706; China National Institute of Food and Drug Control (CNIFDC), China], and was then placed into a 25 mL brown volumetric flask, dissolved with methanol to 25 mL, shaken, and filtered as the reference stock solution. A curcumin control solution (25.4 μg·mL
 <sup>-1</sup>) was prepared by diluting a 1 mL aliquot of this stock solution with methanol in a 10 mL brown volumetric flask. Dried powdered rhizome (0.5 g) was placed into a 50 mL conical flask to which 20 mL methanol was added. The mixture was sonicated for 1 h, and then centrifuged. To the resulting supernatant, 15 mL of methanol was added, followed by sonication for 40 min and subsequent filtering. The residual material was rinsed with a small amount of methanol and refiltered. The filtrate, thus, obtained was added to the initial extraction supernatant solution, and the combined filtrate was then made up to 20 mL using methanol at a temperature below 20°C.
