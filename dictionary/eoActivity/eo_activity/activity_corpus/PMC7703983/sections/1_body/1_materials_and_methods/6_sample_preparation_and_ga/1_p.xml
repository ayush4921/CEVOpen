 <italic>wenyujin</italic>, which had been boiled for 1 h at 100°C and 0.1 MPa, and then cut into 1–2 cm slices and dried for 24 h at 50°C. The volatile oil content of samples was then extracted in accordance with Chinese Pharmacopoeia guidelines [
 <xref rid="pone.0242776.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. For high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) we used an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph under the following chromatographic conditions: DB-5MS column (0.25 mm × 30 m, 0.25 μm), helium carrier gas, EI ion ionization method, 200°C source temperature, 70 eV electron energy, 250°C interface temperature, 150 μA emission current, 35 to 455 mass range, and a 0.4 s scan cycle. Xcalibur 1.2 was used as a data processing system, and the map library was NIST (Version 1.7). The heating program used was as follows: an initial temperature of 60°C held for 1 min, followed by an increase from 60°C to 100°C at 4°C·min
 <sup>-1</sup>, from 100°C to 120°C at 2°C·min
 <sup>-1</sup>, from 120°C to 180°C at 1°C·min
 <sup>-1</sup>, and from 180°C to 230°C at 23°C·min
 <sup>-1</sup>, where the temperature was held for 10 min. Other parameters were as follows: 53 kPa column pressure, 1.04°C·min
 <sup>-1</sup> flow rate, and 0.2 μL sample volume. A 20 μL volume of eugenol:
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane (20:1) was added to a 2 mL brown gas-phase flask, to which was added 1000 μL of 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane. The solution was mixed by vortexing for 1 min and then filtered. To obtain the total ion chromatograms of different volatile oils, we used an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph coupled to a 5975 C quadrupole mass spectrometer. The relative value (percentage) of each chromatogram peak was calculated using the peak area normalization method, and following a computer search and manual analysis, the compounds were identified with reference to the literature.
