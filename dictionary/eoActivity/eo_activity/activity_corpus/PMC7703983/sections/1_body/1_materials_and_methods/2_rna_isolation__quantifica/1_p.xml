<p>Total RNA was isolated from each sample (rhizomes) using a Quick RNA isolation kit (Bioteke Corporation, Beijing, China). Three biological replicates per experimental group were used for sequencing. Agarose gel (1%) electrophoresis was used to assess the contamination and degradation of RNA. The purity and concentration of the isolated RNA were determined using a Nano spectrophotometer (Photometer
 <sup>®</sup>; IMPLEN, CA, USA) and a Qubit
 <sup>®</sup>2.0 Fluorometer Kit (RNA Assay, Life Technologies, CA, USA), respectively, whereas an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer system (Nano 6000; Agilent Technologies, CA, USA) was used to evaluate RNA integrity.
