<p>In the present study, we used topGO to analyze the functional enrichment of DEGs with respect to the three GO functional categories, CC, BP, and MF (enrichment significance, K
 <sub>S</sub> &lt; 0.05), the details of which are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0242776.s016">S9 Table</xref>. Among all DEGs, plastid and chloroplast (CC); methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway, isopentenyl diphosphate biosynthetic process, and thylakoid membrane organization (BP); and protein serine/threonine kinase activity and protein kinase activity (MF) were enriched in WZ rhizomes compared with that in HK rhizomes. Among the up-regulated DEGs, the GO terms pollen tube tip (CC); leaf morphogenesis (BP); and polyamine oxidase activity, isomerase activity, ion channel activity, and phospholipase activity (MF) were significantly enriched in WZ compared with those in HK, whereas for down-regulated DEGs, cell wall (CC); defense responses to fungus (BP); and peroxidase activity, copper ion binding, sucrose synthase activity, heat shock protein binding, and catalytic activity (MF) were significantly enriched in WZ compared with those in HK (
