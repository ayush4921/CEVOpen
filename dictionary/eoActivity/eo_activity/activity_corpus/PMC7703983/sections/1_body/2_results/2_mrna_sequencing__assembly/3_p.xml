<p>With respect to KEGG pathways, we identified 1,597 unique sequences (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0242776.g005">Fig 5</xref>). The predominantly enriched pathways appeared to include the following: endocytosis (36; 3.5%) and phagosome (35; 3.4%) in cellular processes; endoplasmic reticulum protein processing (70; 7.09%), spliceosome (77; 8.0%), ribosome (89; 9.09%), and RNA transport (57; 5.5%) in genetic information processing; and carbon metabolism (72; 7.12%), and biosynthesis of amino acids (58; 5.6%) in metabolism.
