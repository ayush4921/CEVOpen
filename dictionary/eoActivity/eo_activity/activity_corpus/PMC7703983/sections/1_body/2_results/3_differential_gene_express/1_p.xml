<p>We used the fragments per kilobase per million reads mapped (FPKM) procedure to calculate the expression level of genes [
 <xref rid="pone.0242776.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], and DESeq (R package, version 1.10.1) was used for DEG analysis, The latter revealed that 4,620 genes were significantly differentially expressed in WZ compared with those in HK, of which 3,978 were up-regulated and 642 were down-regulated (
