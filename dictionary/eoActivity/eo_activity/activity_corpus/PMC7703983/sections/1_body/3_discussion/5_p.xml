<p>In the present study, we found that among all genes that were differentially expressed between Wenzhou and Haikou rhizomes, the GO terms of plastid and chloroplast (CC); methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway, isopentenyl diphosphate biosynthetic process, and thylakoid membrane organization (BP), and protein kinase activity and protein serine/threonine kinase activity (MF) were predominantly enriched in the rhizomes from Wenzhou compared with those from Haikou. Among up-regulated DEGs, the GO terms of pollen tube tip (CC), leaf morphogenesis (BP), and polyamine oxidase activity, isomerase activity, ion channel activity, and phospholipase activity (MF) were significantly enriched in Wenzhou rhizomes, whereas for down-regulated DEGs, the GO terms cell wall (CC), defense response to fungus (BP), and peroxidase activity, copper ion binding, sucrose synthase activity, heat shock protein binding, and catalytic activity (MF) were significantly enriched in Wenzhou rhizomes. We assume that these differences reflect the fact that when grown under different environmental conditions,
