<p>Previous studies that have conducted chemical component and transcriptome analyses of 
 <italic>Curcuma</italic> species have reported large variations in the content and composition of volatile oils and the content of curcumin and polysaccharide among different 
 <italic>Curcuma</italic> species grown in different areas, as well as in the corresponding Rhizoma Curcumae [

 <xref rid="pone.0242776.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Consistently, the findings of the present revealed large differences in the content and composition of volatile oils and the content of curcumin, polysaccharide, and starch in the rhizomes of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>wenyujin</italic> sourced from the traditional production areas in Wenzhou and the more recently established production areas in Haikou. Notably in this regard, we detected significantly higher content of the volatile oil terpene, curcumin, and polysaccharides in 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>wenyujin</italic> rhizomes from Wenzhou compared with that in the rhizomes of plants cultivated in the Haikou area, whereas the content of starch was significantly higher in the Haikou rhizomes. Additionally, we detected certain differences between Wenzhou and Haikou rhizomes with respect to the composition of the volatile oil, which is consistent with the observations of Huang et al., who found that the volatile oil content of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>wenyujin</italic> rhizomes from Haikou (2.9%) was slightly lower than that of rhizomes from Zhejiang (3.0%), and also reported considerable differences in the volatile oil constituents of plants growing in different habitats [
 <xref rid="pone.0242776.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Further studies have also shown differences in the chemical constituents of volatile oils in 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>wenyujin</italic> from different planting areas, which were found to be associated with differences in the quality of the corresponding medicinal materials [
 <xref rid="pone.0242776.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0242776.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0242776.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. It has similarly been demonstrated that volatile oil content may vary depending upon the origin of the variety, cultivation area, cultivation techniques, and extraction method [
 <xref rid="pone.0242776.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and Cao et al. have reported that the content of volatile oil and curcumin differed substantially in different experimental areas, with the curcumin content varying from 1.5% to 5% and volatile oil content ranging from 0.4% to 0.7% [
 <xref rid="pone.0242776.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. In the present study, RT-PCR and transcriptome RNA-seq analyses revealed that genes involved in terpene, curcumin, and polysaccharide production were significantly up-regulated in 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>wenyujin</italic> rhizomes from Wenzhou, thereby indicating that these genes are closely associated with observed differences in the profiles of these metabolites in 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>wenyujin</italic> cultivated in different areas. In contrast, we observed that starch-related pathways were significantly up-regulated in the rhizomes of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>wenyujin</italic> cultivated in Haikou. These results are consistent with the findings of previous studies that have indicated that 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>wenyujin</italic> rhizomes from Wenzhou have higher content of the volatile oil, terpene, curcumin, polysaccharide but lower starch content than those in 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>wenyujin</italic> rhizomes from Haikou. We also found that the gene expression patterns were consistent with those determined based on transcriptome FPKM analysis (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0242776.g003">3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0242776.g010">10</xref>). Huang et al. have previously suggested that whereas differences in the starch content of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>wenyujin</italic> rhizomes from different producing areas are not appreciably influenced by latitude and longitude, they may be related to local soil, temperature, and light conditions, as well cultivation measures [
 <xref rid="pone.0242776.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Starch formation is a photosynthesis-related dark reaction involving a series of enzymatic reactions within the chloroplast matrix, which is influenced to varying degrees by temperature, CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentration, and pH. It can therefore be speculated that differences in these environmental factors between Wenzhou and Haikou contribute to the observed differences in the content of starch and/or other substances in 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>wenyujin</italic> rhizomes. Similarly, gene expression analysis has revealed that the curcumin content of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>wenyujin</italic> rhizomes is markedly affected by environmental factors and changes in nutritional conditions [
