 <xref rid="pone.0242776.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], one of the important focuses of which is the study of the biosynthesis of metabolites in non-model medicinal plants [

 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>wenyujin</italic> cultivated in the Wenzhou and Haikou production areas, and accordingly found that the rhizomes of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>wenyujin</italic> grown in Wenzhou showed significant differences with respect to the transcriptional profiles of the co-expressed transcripts when compared with the rhizomes of plants grown in Haikou. Among these co-expressed transcripts, we found that when compared with those in Haikou rhizomes, the number of genes up-regulated in Wenzhou rhizomes was greater than those down-regulated. Functional analysis indicated that the enriched KEGG pathways appeared to be primarily associated with endocytosis and phagosome among cellular processes; ribosome, endoplasmic reticulum protein processing, RNA transport and spliceosome in genetic information processing; and carbon metabolism and biosynthesis of amino acids with respect to metabolism, thereby implying that the associated regulatory genes are significantly differentially expressed between the

 <italic>wenyujin</italic> rhizomes obtained from Wenzhou and Haikou.
