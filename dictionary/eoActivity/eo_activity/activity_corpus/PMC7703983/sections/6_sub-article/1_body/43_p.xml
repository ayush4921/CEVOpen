<p>L282 : Univariate analysis of variance was applied to determine the significance of the results among different treatments. The target of the analysis unclear. Does it means "different species", and the variables are compound components? Since they have only two groups, are there any rational reason to apply univariate ANOVA instead of t-test or U-test?</p>
