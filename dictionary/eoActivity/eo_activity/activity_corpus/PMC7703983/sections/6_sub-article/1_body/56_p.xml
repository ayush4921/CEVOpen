<p>Fig. 7: Make clear the number of genes shown in this figure, is it 3720? If it is so make clear how and why these genes were chosen. It is not clear what means "up/down regulated" in this figure, I mean compared with what values.And the labels in the columns should be replaced by their real labels (T01 = HK1, T02 = HK2, T03 = HK3, T04 = WZ1, T05 = 393 WZ2, T06 = WZ3).</p>
