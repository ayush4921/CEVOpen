<p>Revision: These 15 genes are genes related to terpenoids, curcumin, polysaccharides, and starch metabolism pathways of Rhizoma Curcuma, and the selected genes are expressed in both samples. The differential expression of genes in the two regions is high, and the p value and FDR value are within the range. These genes are designed with appropriate primers and quantified.</p>
