  <title>Enrichment of KEGG pathways with genes that were differentially expressed between Wenzhou (WZ) and Haikou (HK) rhizomes.</title>
  <p>Pathway name and enrichment intensity are shown in the right-hand legend. The Q value is the corrected 
   <italic>P</italic>-value (false discovery rate). The enrichment factor is the ratio of the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in a pathway to the number of all genes in that pathway. (a, all DEGs; b, up-regulated DEGs; c, down-regulated DEGs).
