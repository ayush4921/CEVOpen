The plant <italic>Curcuma wenyujin</italic>, which is grown primarily in Wenzhou, China, is considered the best source of Rhizoma Curcumae. In this study, we sought to ascertain differences in transcript profiles of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>wenyujin</italic> grown in traditional (Wenzhou) and recently established (Haikou) production areas based on Illumina and RNA (RNA-seq) sequencing. We also examined differences in the main components of the volatile oil terpene; curcumin, polysaccharide, and starch constituents and related genes in the corresponding pathways, in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>wenyujin</italic> cultivated in the two production areas. We accordingly found that the essential oil (2.05%), curcumin (1.46%), and polysaccharide (8.90%) content in Wenzhou rhizomes was higher than that in the rhizomes of plants from Haikou (1.60%, 0.91%, and 6.15%, respectively). In contrast, the starch content of Wenzhou rhizomes (17.0%) was lower than that of Haikou rhizomes (23.8%). Furthermore, we detected significant differences in the oil components of Haikou and Wenzhou rhizomes, with curzerene (32.34%), curdione (21.35%), and germacrene B (9.39%) being the primary components of the essential oil derived from Wenzhou rhizomes, and curzerene (20.13%), curdione (14.73%), and cineole (9.76%) being the main constituents in Haikou rhizomes. Transcriptome and qPCR analyses revealed considerable differences in gene expression between Wenzhou and Haikou rhizomes. The expression of terpene, curcumin, and polysaccharide pathway-related genes in Wenzhou rhizomes was significantly up-regulated, whereas the expression of starch-associated genes was significantly down-regulated, compared with those in Haikou rhizomes. Difference in the content of terpene, curcumin, polysaccharides, and starch in rhizomes from the two production areas could be explained in terms of differences in expression of the related genes.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>YES, Hainan province Key Scientific and Technological Research and Development Special Project (Grant No: ZDKJ2016006), The funders had a role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="10"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="23"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the manuscript and its <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec026">Supporting information</xref> files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the manuscript and its <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec026">Supporting information</xref> files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Curcuma</italic> is a plant genus comprising more than 70 rhizome-producing species worldwide. In China, there are approximately 20 <italic>Curcuma</italic> species, a small number of which have been used in Chinese herbal medicines and food products for more than a thousand years. Rhizoma Curcuma is the dried rhizome of <italic>Curcuma kwangsiensis</italic> S.G. Lee &#x00026; C.F. Liang, <italic>Curcuma phaeocaulis</italic> Valeton, and <italic>Curcuma wenyujin</italic> Y.H.

Given that different environmental conditions can promote changes in the active constituents and alter the transcriptional regulation of genes that control the formation of secondary metabolites, the same <italic>C</italic>. <italic>wenyujin</italic> genotype can produce rhizomes with differing qualities depending on the region in and conditions under which the plants are cultivated, and consequently this can potentially present difficulties with respect to quality control.</p><p>A notable characteristic of plants is their plasticity in response to unfavorable environmental conditions [<xref rid="pone.0242776.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242776.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Plants typically initiate a series of specific biochemical responses to environmental stressors associated with diverse aspects of their biology, including development, evolution, molecular biology, anatomy, physiology, genetics, and biochemistry [<xref rid="pone.0242776.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242776.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], which are of particular importance from the perspectives of predicting changes in community composition, distribution, and crop productivity in response to continuously changing environments [<xref rid="pone.0242776.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242776.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>A range of environmental factors (both biotic and abiotic) can affect (often adversely) medicinal plants during their growth, thereby influencing the formation and accumulation of terpenoids, ketones, phenols, alkaloids, flavonoid, flavonols, volatile oils, and other secondary metabolites [<xref rid="pone.0242776.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242776.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. For example, differences in the chemical and physical properties of soils (determined by the parent material) can influence the growth and quality of plants, and in this regard, it has been found that the oil content of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>wenyujin</italic> rhizomes cultivated in alkaline soils is higher than that of rhizomes cultivated in acidic red soils [<xref rid="pone.0242776.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) is an important intermediate in the biosynthesis of terpenoids and steroids in plants, and steroidal alkaloids can also be formed through other pathways. IPP is formed as a common intermediate in both the mevalonate (MVA) and 2-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-erythritol-4-phosphoric acid (MEP) pathways, and can pass through cell walls to transfer between these two pathways [<xref rid="pone.0242776.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Abiotic environmental factors (including light, temperature, moisture, and nutrition) affect metabolism and the synthesis of metabolites, predominantly by influencing gene expression and transcriptional factors in the associated metabolic pathways (e.g., MVA and MEP) of secondary metabolites, such as terpenoids, flavonoids and flavonols [<xref rid="pone.0242776.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0242776.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].

Notably in this regard, we detected significantly higher content of the volatile oil terpene, curcumin, and polysaccharides in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>wenyujin</italic> rhizomes from Wenzhou compared with that in the rhizomes of plants cultivated in the Haikou area, whereas the content of starch was significantly higher in the Haikou rhizomes. Additionally, we detected certain differences between Wenzhou and Haikou rhizomes with respect to the composition of the volatile oil, which is consistent with the observations of Huang et al., who found that the volatile oil content of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>wenyujin</italic> rhizomes from Haikou (2.9%) was slightly lower than that of rhizomes from Zhejiang (3.0%), and also reported considerable differences in the volatile oil constituents of plants growing in different habitats [<xref rid="pone.0242776.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Further studies have also shown differences in the chemical constituents of volatile oils in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>wenyujin</italic> from different planting areas, which were found to be associated with differences in the quality of the corresponding medicinal materials [<xref rid="pone.0242776.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242776.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242776.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. It has similarly been demonstrated that volatile oil content may vary depending upon the origin of the variety, cultivation area, cultivation techniques, and extraction method [<xref rid="pone.0242776.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and Cao et al. have reported that the content of volatile oil and curcumin differed substantially in different experimental areas, with the curcumin content varying from 1.5% to 5% and volatile oil content ranging from 0.4% to 0.7% [<xref rid="pone.0242776.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. In the present study, RT-PCR and transcriptome RNA-seq analyses revealed that genes involved in terpene, curcumin, and polysaccharide production were significantly up-regulated in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>wenyujin</italic> rhizomes from Wenzhou, thereby indicating that these genes are closely associated with observed differences in the profiles of these metabolites in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>wenyujin</italic> cultivated in different areas. In contrast, we observed that starch-related pathways were significantly up-regulated in the rhizomes of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>wenyujin</italic> cultivated in Haikou. These results are consistent with the findings of previous studies that have indicated that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>wenyujin</italic> rhizomes from Wenzhou have higher content of the volatile oil, terpene, curcumin, polysaccharide but lower starch content than those in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>wenyujin</italic> rhizomes from Haikou. We also found that the gene expression patterns were consistent with those determined based on transcriptome FPKM analysis (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0242776.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0242776.g010">10</xref>). Huang et al. have previously suggested that whereas differences in the starch content of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>wenyujin</italic> rhizomes from different producing areas are not appreciably influenced by latitude and longitude, they may be related to local soil, temperature, and light conditions, as well cultivation measures [<xref rid="pone.0242776.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Starch formation is a photosynthesis-related dark reaction involving a series of enzymatic reactions within the chloroplast matrix, which is influenced to varying degrees by temperature, CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, and pH. It can therefore be speculated that differences in these environmental factors between Wenzhou and Haikou contribute to the observed differences in the content of starch and/or other substances in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>wenyujin</italic> rhizomes. Similarly, gene expression analysis has revealed that the curcumin content of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>wenyujin</italic> rhizomes is markedly affected by environmental factors and changes in nutritional conditions [<xref rid="pone.0242776.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Transcriptomics is concerned with analysis of the gene expression levels and diversity profiles of different tissues in animals and plants [<xref rid="pone.0242776.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0242776.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], one of the important focuses of which is the study of the biosynthesis of metabolites in non-model medicinal plants [<xref rid="pone.0242776.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242776.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>].

Among these co-expressed transcripts, we found that when compared with those in Haikou rhizomes, the number of genes up-regulated in Wenzhou rhizomes was greater than those down-regulated. Functional analysis indicated that the enriched KEGG pathways appeared to be primarily associated with endocytosis and phagosome among cellular processes; ribosome, endoplasmic reticulum protein processing, RNA transport and spliceosome in genetic information processing; and carbon metabolism and biosynthesis of amino acids with respect to metabolism, thereby implying that the associated regulatory genes are significantly differentially expressed between the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>wenyujin</italic> rhizomes obtained from Wenzhou and Haikou.</p><p>Overall, we found that 980 DEGs were allocated to KEGG pathways, among which those associated with spliceosome, endoplasmic reticulum protein processing, ribosome, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, RNA transport, phagosome, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, and glutathione metabolism were predominantly enriched. With respect to up-regulated DEGs, pathways associated with spliceosome, carbon metabolism, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, proteasome, citrate cycle (TCA cycle), aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, arginine and proline metabolism, and glutathione metabolism were predominantly enriched, whereas for the down-regulated DEGs, pathways relating to ribosome, starch and sucrose metabolism, endoplasmic reticulum protein processing, plant hormone signal transduction, protein export, and riboflavin metabolism were significantly enriched. These findings are thus indicative of the active biosynthesis of not only secondary but also primary metabolites.

Among up-regulated DEGs, the GO terms of pollen tube tip (CC), leaf morphogenesis (BP), and polyamine oxidase activity, isomerase activity, ion channel activity, and phospholipase activity (MF) were significantly enriched in Wenzhou rhizomes, whereas for down-regulated DEGs, the GO terms cell wall (CC), defense response to fungus (BP), and peroxidase activity, copper ion binding, sucrose synthase activity, heat shock protein binding, and catalytic activity (MF) were significantly enriched in Wenzhou rhizomes.

The Chinese Pharmacopoeia recorded that Curcumae Radix should be the dry radix of Curcuma wenyujin Y. H. Chen and C. Ling, C. longa L., C. kwangsiensis S. G. Lee, and C. phaeocaulis Valeton. And Curcumae Rhizoma should be the dry rhizomes derived from the above-mentioned species except C. longa L. They are similar in source but different in medicinal parts. Curcumae Rhizoma and Curcumae Radix are confused in variety and source, even in clinical trials by some nonprofessional workers. So, it is important for us to make them clear. Also, genotype and environment interaction is high for secondary metabolites in Curcuma sp. The main objective of the present study was to analyze the constituents of essential oils such as terpene, curcumin, polysaccharide, starch, and other important substances from C. Wenyujin rhizomes from the traditional (Wenzhou) and introduced (Haikou) production areas. In this study authors also attempted comparative RNAseq profiles of C. Wenyujin rhizomes produced in traditional (Wenzhou) and introduced (Haikou) areas. The study has some interesting findings in the poorly understood crop species of Curcuma.</p><p>However, authors need to clarify following points.</p><p>The introduction part seems to be too lengthy &#x02013; cab be shortened.</p><p>L.71: The terminology 'Species variety' is not botanically correct. Authors may use the term &#x02018;genotype&#x02019; instead.</p><p>L.86: There is nothing called &#x0201c;lime soil&#x0201d;.

Also specify the tissue from which RNA was isolated.</p><p>In case of RNASeq, number of biological replicates sequences is not clear. Also, replicates need to be compared at sequence level and prove that they are not significantly different.</p><p>L.209: Sufficient experimental details viz., temperature, pressure and slice thickness need to be given on boiling and drying of samples?</p><p>L.234: What is the sample? rhizome or leaf, or at what stage?</p><p>L. 248: Is it a curcumin or curcuminoids</p><p>L.268: Polysaccharide and starch content methodology are too elaborate and need to shorten with suitable references.</p><p>L 361&#x02026;&#x02026;&#x02026;..</p><p>In many literatures, the C. weeyujin is referred as synonymous to C. aromatica.

In additon your are required to improve lablelling and quality of figures.</p><p>Revision: Thank you very much for the suggestion, and We have accepted the expert's suggestion that we improve the description of the method and language by polishing the company to meet the #3 and #5 public standards. In particular, Why are parameters and thresholds added to the applied method to explain the rationality of choosing a specific statistical test (here, univariate ANOVA), Curcuma rhizomes from different species, and they have only two groups, We had applied univariate ANOVA instead of t-test or U-test. Seen in lines 282 in the revised. and the DEG analysis part and enrichment results have been modified and explained.

The functions of the unique sequences extracted from C. wenyujin were classified based on the three GO terms: cellular component (CC), biological process (BP), and molecular function (MF), The DEGs were mainly assigned to &#x02018;cell, go: 0005623&#x02019;, &#x02018;cell part, go: 0044464&#x02019;, &#x02018;organelle, go: 0043226&#x02019;, &#x02018;membrane, go: 0016020&#x02019;,&#x02018;cellular process, go: 0009987&#x02019;, &#x02018;metabolic process, go: 0008152&#x02019;, &#x02018;single-organism process, go: 0044699&#x02019;, &#x02018;binding, go: 0005488&#x02019;, and &#x02018;catalytic activity, go: 0003824&#x02019; (Fig 4). and We had some KEEG and GO enrichment analysis seen in lines 405-418 and 446-458 in the revised manuscript and related enrichment information was seen in S9, S10 Table and S1 File. We will conduct more in-depth research in the future on the significance of enrichment analysis.</p><p>Fig. 7: Make clear the number of genes shown in this figure, is it 3720? If it is so make clear how and why these genes were chosen. It is not clear what means "up/down regulated" in this figure, I mean compared with what values.And the labels in the columns should be replaced by their real labels (T01 = HK1, T02 = HK2, T03 = HK3, T04 = WZ1, T05 = 393 WZ2, T06 = WZ3).</p><p>Revision: Thank you for your comments. Make clear the number of genes shown in this figure is 4620. These genes were chosen because of a significant difference in these genes between WZ and HK . the values of up/down regulated" in this figure were those of WZ compared HK. And the labels in the columns have been replaced by their real labels (HK1, HK2, HK3, WZ1, WZ2, WZ3) in Fig 7 in the revised manuscript.</p><p>L409: A comparison of DEGs in 26 COG classifications between HK and WZ is shown in Fig 8. It is not clear that the numbers of DEG in this figure means up regulated or down regulated. And for enrichment analysis, it is also important to show the number of annotated genes in each category and the ratio of DEG to the annotated genes.</p><p>Revision: Thank you for your comments, We mean that 26 COG functional classifications of consensus sequence of DEGs between HK and WZ are shown in Fig 8, not a comparison of DEGs in 26 COG classifications between HK and WZ is shown in Fig 8. We have revised it seen in Line 409. We have showed the number of annotated genes in main eight categories and the ratio of DEG to the annotated genes, seen in lines 424-432in the revised manuscript.</p><p>L 454:It seems meaningless to show the sequence id such like c118842.grraph-co, show gene name or protein name instead. It would be much better to show them in the pathway map also.</p><p>Revision: Thank you for your comments, We have showed gene name or protein name instead of the sequence id such like c118842.grraph-co seen in lines 475-478 in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Fig. 10Arrange the plots for FPKM and rt-PCR side by side when the comparison about the same gene is important.</p><p>Revision: Thank you for your comments, We have arranged the plots for FPKM (DGE) and RT-PCR side by side when the comparison, seen in Fig. 10 in the revised manuscript.</p><p>7.
