(âˆ’)-epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG), is a natural compound contained in green tea extract has anti-atherogenic and anti-inflammatory properties, and plays a key role in the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
 <xref rid="cit0057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> In Wistar rat model of dementia, 10 mg/kg/day oral administration of EGCG for 4 weeks significantly reversed the cognitive deficit, reduced oxidative and nitrosative stress, and modulated AChE activity in STZ treated rats.
 <xref rid="cit0058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> Lee et al conducted a preclinical study on ICR mice to investigate the effect of EGCG on the systemic neuroinflammation and memory impairment. The study results showed that chronic oral administration of 1.5 and 3 mg/kg EGCG could inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced cytokine release and amyloidogenesis, as well as prevent memory impairment, apoptotic neuronal cell death, and microglia activation.
