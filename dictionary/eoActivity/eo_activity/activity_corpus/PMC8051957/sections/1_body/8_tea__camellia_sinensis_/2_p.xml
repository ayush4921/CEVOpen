 <xref rid="cit0061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> Several findings from animal and human studies have demonstrated the neuroprotective potential of tea polyphenols, catechins and epicatechin, in improving cognitive decline and neuronal signaling. The potential mechanisms behind that are due to improving the endogenous antioxidant activities, regulation of apoptosis, reduction of Aβ synthesis, and modulation of mitochondrial function and neural growth factors.
