<p>Aging or cognitive diseases are characterized by amyloid protein deposition and cholinergic neurotransmission deficits in the brain. Unfortunately, currently available dementia treatments, such as choline esterase inhibitors, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists (memantine), and calcium channel blockers, have short-term efficacy, and only relieve symptoms rather than targeting the main underlying pathogenesis.
 <xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Memantine is a relatively weak NMDA receptor antagonist, approved for AD by the FDA in 2003, given to patients with moderate to severe cognitive deficits, and is known to prevent neuronal damage and synaptic loss caused by upregulation of NMDA receptors.
 <xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> As conventional therapies have many side effects and fail to improve cognitive decline, natural products and non-pharmacological interventions appear to be promising and safer alternative approaches with a beneficial impact on cognitive behaviors, thus they should be central strategies in the treatment of memory impairment.
