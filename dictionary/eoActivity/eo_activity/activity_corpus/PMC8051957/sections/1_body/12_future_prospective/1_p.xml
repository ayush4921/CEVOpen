<p>Dementias and Alzheimerâ€™s disease are closely intertwined multifactorial diseases caused by a cascade of genetic and environmental risk factors developing over a period of time. The heterogeneous nature of factors causing the disease has made it very difficult to find the right treatment as one drug will not be sufficient to make a difference in all related dementias. Therefore, there has not been any substantial progress in the development of a successful line of dementia treatment. The reason behind the multiple failures of clinical trials of drugs targeting memory loss could be attributed to delay in the starting of therapies in the disease progression, ineffective drug doses, incorrect target of the treatment, and most importantly an incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of memory loss, as well as the progression of neuro-degeneration.</p>
