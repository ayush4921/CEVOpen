<p>Resveratrol (3,5,4′- trihydroxystilbene) belongs to a family of polyphenolic compounds known as stilbenes. Peanuts, pistachios, berries, and grapes are essential sources of resveratrol.
 <xref rid="cit0092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref> The trans-isomer of resveratrol in the skin of most grape species is more effective and more stable than Cis-isomer. Resveratrol has been shown to exhibit anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-aging, cardio-protective and anti-oxidant properties.

 <xref rid="cit0095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref> A cell line study by Vingtdeux et al studied the potential effect of resveratrol in AD. The investigators observed that resveratrol was able to inhibit the extracellular Aβ accumulation by facilitating its proteolytic clearance in neuronal cells, and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase in the cerebral cortex of transgenic mice.
 <xref rid="cit0096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref> In order to enhance the cerebral bioavailability of resveratrol, the development of novel formulations for brain targeting is highly recommended.
