<p>Caffeine is a naturally occurring CNS stimulant found in coffee, tea, and other plants. It has been used for medicinal purposes in many systems of traditional medicine for over thousands of years. Coffee is the main source of caffeine, and it contains phenolics and other bioactive compounds that may have either positive or negative effects on health. Different coffee preparations contain varying levels of caffeine, such as 0.6–3.3 mg/mL in espresso, 0.7–1.1 mg/mL in boiled or filtered coffee, and 0.2–0.6 mg/mL in instant coffee.

 <xref rid="cit0107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref> Caffeine binds with A1 and A2A adenosine receptors. It has positive effects on attention, arousal, mood and vigilance. In high amounts, caffeine can induce anxiety, restlessness, insomnia and psychomotor agitation.
 <xref rid="cit0108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref> Crude caffeine has higher levels of hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidant activity than pure caffeine. Caffeine when given in high doses has been reported to inhibit phosphorylation of esterase enzyme which in turn leads to the induction of calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, thus activating protein kinase A. This cascade of signaling pathways is in the phosphorylation of enzymes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism. Caffeine intake minimizes the risk of cognitive impairment in neurological conditions, including sleep deprivation, alcohol consumption, diabetes, Parkinson’s disease, and AD.

 <xref rid="cit0110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref> Several in vitro and in vivo studies reported that caffeine exhibits neuroprotective effects as it protects cortical neurons against Aβ toxicity as well as prevents Aβ-induced memory deficits in mice.
 <xref rid="cit0111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref> A long-term study in mice has supported that as well, showing that caffeine intakes can prevent the memory decline related to age which is associated with changes in neurotrophic factor (BDNF).
 <xref rid="cit0112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref> It has been reported that caffeine treatment at 40 mg/kg significantly enhances Aβ clearance (20%) in the brain endothelial cells of C57BL/6 mice.
 <xref rid="cit0113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref> In another related study, it is found out that caffeine (0.6 mg/d) increases hippocampal mitochondrial respiration (25%) and ATP levels (46%) in the APPSw mice. Caffeine increases hippocampal mitochondrial membrane potential (78%) and decreases ROS production (100%) in Alzheimer’s mice.
 <xref rid="cit0114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref> Caffeine decreased the cholesterol-induced increase in Aβ, phosphorylated tau, and oxidative stress levels in rabbits’ hippocampus and reversed the cholesterol-induced decrease in adenosine A1 receptors (A1R) levels when given in the drinking water at 0.5 and 30 mg/day.
 <xref rid="cit0115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref> Many randomized controlled trials support the potential role of caffeine in improving cognition. A 21-year follow-up study (875 women and 534 men, age 50 years) concluded that moderate consumption (3–5 cups) of coffee substantially reduced the risk of AD (62–64%) and dementia (65–70%) later in life, compared with low coffee consumers (0–2 cups).
 <xref rid="cit0116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref> The consumption of caffeine is linked to faster processing of new information and improved simple reaction time.
 <xref rid="cit0117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref> In a large prospective cohort study of 2475 females over 65 years old with vascular diseases, the relation between habitual caffeine uses and long-term cognitive decline was examined over five years. As a result, coffee consumption was linked to a slower rate of cognitive decline, especially in women with stable diets.
 <xref rid="cit0118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref> In another prospective study conducted by the Canadian Study of Health and Aging (CSHA) for five years, daily coffee consumption reduced the risk of AD by 31%.
 <xref rid="cit0119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref> However, at autopsy, patients who consumed more than 277.5 mg of caffeine a day had a decreased probability of presenting AD-related lesions, or other ischemic lesions.
 <xref rid="cit0120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref> Caffeine has been found to reduce the risk of developing AD in patients with apolipoprotein E (ApoE ε4) allele.
 <xref rid="cit0121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref> In contrast, a recent study from the Honolulu-Asian Aging Study failed to establish a significant correlation between caffeine consumption and dementia risk.
 <xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Similarly, a longitudinal study in the Netherlands reported that no significant correlation between caffeine intake and a reduced risk of cognitive decline.
