<p>Lycopene is an aliphatic hydrocarbon carotenoid extracted from tomatoes, watermelons, and papayas. It is a strong anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-proliferative agent. Lycopene is well known for its beneficial effects against solid tumors and non-alcoholic fatty liver.

Long-term lycopene intake has been found to inhibit the oxidative stress and reduce infarct volume and neuronal apoptosis in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion in high-fat diet-induced cognitive impairment in rats.

 <xref rid="cit0101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref> Zhu et al conducted a study on a rat model of bilateral carotid artery occlusion induced VD to evaluate the protective effect of lycopene on memory impairment. The study results indicated that chronic administration of lycopene could effectively inhibit oxidative stress and reduce the expression of neuron-restrictive silencer factor (
