<p>Berberine is an isoquinoline alkaloid extracted from barberry, it has wide medicinal uses in the treatment of bacterial diarrhea, hypercholesterolemia, type 2 diabetes, cardiac disease, and cancer.
 <xref rid="cit0103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref> Despite many experimental studies elucidating the neuroprotective effects of berberine, its definite mechanism of enhancing memory functions is not fully understood. An in vitro study by Asai et al explored that 10 μmol L
 <sup>−1</sup> berberine could reduce amyloid β levels to 30% via modulation of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) pathway in human neuroglioma H4 cells.
 <xref rid="cit0104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref> Another in vitro study investigated the potential effect of berberine on Aβ-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in primary cultured hippocampal neurons. The study findings confirmed that berberine may preserve mitochondrial membrane potential, improve mitochondrial motility and prevent synaptic loss.
