 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> L. is a tuberous herbaceous perennial plant with yellow flowers and wide leaves, belongs to the 
 <italic>Zingiberaceae</italic> family, and grows in the tropical climate. Curcumin (diferuloylmethane) and curcuminoid analogs such as demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin are the main bioactive components in the rhizome of 
 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic>, and commonly used as natural coloring agents in food. In traditional Indian medicine, turmeric is widely used for the treatment of many pathological conditions, such as asthma, epilepsy, gallstone and diabetic.
 <xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> As previously described, neuroinflammation is one of the key causes of cognitive decline. Significant evidence from preclinical and clinical studies elucidated the key role of curcumin in attenuating the neuroinflammatory cytokines, such as monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-), TNF-α, IL-6 and TGF-β.
 <xref rid="cit0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> A cell line study conducted by Park et al to assess the neuroprotective mechanisms of curcumin against Aβ
 <sub>25–35</sub> induced neurotoxicity in PC12 cells. The study findings have shown that curcumin exposure inhibited hyperphosphorylation of microtubule-associated tau proteins, reduced oxidative stress and intracellular calcium influx.
 <xref rid="cit0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Fluorescence and confocal microscopy were used to measure the Aβ uptake by the macrophages of AD patients and control individuals. The results showed a significant increase of Aβ uptake by the macrophages of AD patients compared to curcuminoids-treated and control groups.
 <xref rid="cit0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> Curcumin has been found to enhance glutathione expression, antioxidant enzyme and heme oxygenase in dementia and AD patients.
 <xref rid="cit0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> Agrawal et al studied the effect of curcumin on memory functions, brain insulin receptors (IRs), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in dementia model in rats. The researchers demonstrated that curcumin could significantly enhance cholinergic activity, attenuate oxidative damage and improve memory deficits in the (STZ)-treated rats compared to controls.
 <xref rid="cit0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> Ganguli et al have noticed lower AD incidence in the Indian population consuming a curcumin-rich diet compared to the US population.
 <xref rid="cit0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> This neuroprotective potential was likely due to attenuation of oxidative stress and reduction of Aβ deposition, which are the main causes of mitochondrial damage in the brain. Due to the poor oral bioavailability of curcumin, 2000 or 4000 mg/day orally administered curcumin C3 complex (70–80% curcumin) has shown a non-significant difference in the clinical efficacy between treatment groups.
