 <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic> (Gb) is one of the most distinctive plants of the Ginkgoaceae family. Gb possesses a large genome, and it has high resistance to plant pathogens and other environmental factors, such as intense sunlight, temperature, high soil salinity, and so on.
 <xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Gb has been widely used for the treatment of various neurovascular disorders, such as vertigo, tinnitus, venous insufficiency, fatigue and age-related physical and cognitive disorders.
 <xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> EGb761, is a standard Gb extract, contains a mixture of flavonoids (primarily quercetin, kaempferol, and isorhamnetin) and terpenoids (2.8–3.4% ginkgolides A, B, and C, and 2.6–3.2% bilobalide). It has been extensively studied as an effective treatment for memory impairment. Also, it has been reported as an effective therapy against a wide variety of CNS disorders, such as depression, anxiety, stroke, and cerebral insufficiency.

 <xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Gb extract has potential therapeutic effects on ischemic brain injury, cognitive and neurological disorders by improving cerebral perfusion and inhibiting platelet-activating factors. Flavonoids and terpene lactones like ginkgolides and bilobalides are the most isolated phytoconstituents from Gb extract. A standardized Gb extracts effectively reduced tissue damage after brain ischemia, attenuated oxidative stress, and improved cognitive dysfunction in various experimental rat models of dementia and chronic stress.
 <xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16–18</xref> An in vitro study evaluated the antiplatelet activity of EGb761 and concluded that Gb extract has protective effects and functional integrity on cerebral microvascular endothelial cells.
 <xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Cell line studies showed that Gb extract protected cultured brain cells against neurotoxicants like nitric oxide
 <xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and cyanide.
 <xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Oral or intraperitoneal administration of 10–100 mg/kg of Gb extract prevented neuronal damage caused by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats.

 <xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> In one model of vascular dementia in gerbils, EGb761 significantly improved spatial learning and memory, protected the hippocampal CA1 neurons and increased SOD activity in plasma.
 <xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Chronic administration of Gb leaf extract protected rats’ brain against biochemical and degenerative changes induced by aluminum chloride through increasing endogenous antioxidant and inhibiting the formation of free radicals.
 <xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Additionally, treatment with Gb extract has been found to display antioxidant and neuroprotective activities on the prefrontal cortex and dorsal hippocampus of middle-aged rats. The study showed that chronic treatment with Gb extract improved age-related memory impairment and increased the survival of cortical neurons.
 <xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> In a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, the study findings showed that daily administration of 240 mg of Gb extract was safe and effective in the treatment of patients with dementia.
 <xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Furthermore, a meta-analysis study by Wang et al proved that Gb could be an effective treatment for vascular dementia.
 <xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Another meta-analysis study explored the efficacy of EGb 761 in dementia patients treated with 120 mg or 240 mg per day when compared to placebo. The study results showed that EGb 761 was well tolerated in all trials and that 240 mg of EGb 761 was more effective in improving cognition.
 <xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> In contrast, the findings of a randomized, controlled trial demonstrated that 120 mg of Gb extract twice a day is not effective in reducing either the incidence rate of dementia or AD in elderly individuals aged ≥75 years with normal cognition or those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
