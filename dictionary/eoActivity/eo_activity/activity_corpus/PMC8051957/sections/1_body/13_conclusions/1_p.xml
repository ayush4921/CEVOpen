<p>Herein, we reviewed the most medicinal plants which are being used in various traditional systems of medicine, and explain the related mechanisms and effects against dementia. All these collective evidences gathered from clinical trials and animal studies support the treasured value of medicinal plants as an alternative strategy for the prevention or treatment of dementia. Herbal plants and phytoactive compounds are superior in terms of safety when compared with synthetic drugs such as donepezil, and considered as promising alternative strategies for improving memory deficits. Animal models of dementia are not sufficient to understand the plausible explanation of these herbal candidates, thus further clinical studies with a larger sample size are required for developing evidence-based medicines for the treatment of dementia and AD.</p>
