 <italic>Glycyrrhiza</italic> or liquorice is a perennial herb growing in the Mediterranean region, Asia, Southern Russia, and Iran. 
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza</italic> is derived from ancient Greek, glykys means “sweet,” and rhiza is “root.
 <xref rid="cit0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> Glycyrrhizin is the main active component in liquorice, commonly used as a natural sweetener. In Ayurvedic and Unani medicine, liquorice is extensively used for various medical conditions, such as inflammation of respiratory airways and gastrointestinal tract disorders. Glycyrrhizic acid (GA), a triterpenoid saponin glycoside, has demonstrated its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in many experimental studies. Isoflavonoid derivatives, including glabrone, lico-isoflavone A and B, glabridine and galbrene, are also essential bio-active components isolated from liquorice extract. Liquiritigenin from 
 <italic>Glycyrrhizae radix</italic> is a selective estrogen receptor-β (ERβ) agonist, these receptors are distributed in the brain centers of learning and memory.

 <italic>Glycyrrhiza</italic> species that can suppress the caspase-3 proapoptotic activity, and produce potential effectiveness against dementia similar to memantine.
