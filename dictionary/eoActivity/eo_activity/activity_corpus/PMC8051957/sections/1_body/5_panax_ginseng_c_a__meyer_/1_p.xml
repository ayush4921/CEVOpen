<p>Ginseng is a slow-growing perennial herb (Family of Araliaceae; a genus of 
 <italic>Panax</italic>), widely cultivated in northeastern China. In the last decade, many experimental studies have shown that this plant has a key function in preventing neurodegeneration and improving learning and memory deficits.
 <xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Ginseng is an adaptogen, protects against various biological stressors. Ginsenosides, the most valuable active constituents in 
 <italic>Panax ginseng</italic> roots, are known to have a wide range of pharmacological activities including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immunomodulatory, anti-cancer, anti-aging, and adaptogenic activities. Zhang et al studied the neuroprotective potential of ginsenoside Rg2 on memory impairment in a vascular dementia (VD) in a rat model of cerebral ischemic reperfusion. The study results indicated that a significant improvement in cognitive abilities and neurological responses in the ginsenoside Rg2 group relative to the disease control group.
 <xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> A significant reduction in Aβ
 <sub>40</sub> and Aβ
 <sub>42</sub> levels in the brains of transgenic mice and cultured neurons was demonstrated after treatment with ginsenoside Rg3.
 <xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Ginsenoside Rg5 has been tested and found to modulate cognitive dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and increased cholinergic activity in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced memory impairment in rats.
 <xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Hur et al patented a pharmaceutical composition containing ginsenoside Rg18, it has neuroprotective activity against Aβ-induced nerve cell death during brain inflammation.
 <xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> This invention produced a significant improvement of memory and learning skills using a model of Aβ peptide to induce dementia.
 <xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Ginsenoside Rg1 modulates the neurotransmission and enhances glutamate release in the CNS through a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II-dependent signaling pathway.
 <xref rid="cit0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> In a randomized controlled trial, recruited 61 AD patients, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale–Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) tests were used to assess the changes in cognitive and functional performance after chronic oral administration of Korean red ginseng (KRG) as an adjuvant treatment for dementia. The study results demonstrated that the ADAS and Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) were improved markedly after 24 weeks in the high-dose (9 g/day) KRG treated patients relative to those in the control group.
 <xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Briefly, the active constituents of 
 <italic>Panax ginseng</italic> play a crucial role in the regulation of amyloid-β synthesis, acetylcholine signaling and neuro-inflammatory response. Thus, they could be potential candidates in the treatment of dementia and AD.
