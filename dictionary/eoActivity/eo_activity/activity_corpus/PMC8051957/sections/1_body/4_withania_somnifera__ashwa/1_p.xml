 <italic>Withania somnifera</italic> or Ashwagandha or Indian Ginseng (fam. Solanaceae) is a popular Ayurvedic medicinal plant known for its adaptogenic and antistress effects. Ashwagandha is an essential ingredient in Thai traditional medicine; it is used for enhancing memory and body functions. The roots of 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> contain several phytoconstituents such as alkaloids, withanolides, sitoindosides and flavonoids. Among these compounds, withaferin A is a molecule of interest that has shown a neuroprotective effect in various human and animal studies. The immunomodulatory and antioxidant potentials of these bioactive candidates have been explored in an experimental model of acute stress.
 <xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Some of the plausible mechanisms of action of 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> against AD are (i) blocking β-amyloid (Aβ) production; (ii) inhibition of NF-κB pathway; (iii) reduction of neuronal death; (iv) modulation of synaptic transmission and restoring antioxidant enzymes.
 <xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Kuboyama et al have evaluated the effect of withanoside IV on memory improvement and synaptic reconstruction in Aβ
 <sub>25–35</sub> induced injury on cultured rat cortical neurons. The study findings revealed that oral administration of withanoside IV (10 micromole/kg/day) markedly induced neurite outgrowth, restored memory defects, and protected mice from axonal, dendritic and synaptic loss.
 <xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> In a preliminary placebo-controlled trial, Chengappa et al have studied the cognitive impact of standardized 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> extract against bipolar disease. The researchers observed that 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> extract (500 mg/day) significantly enhanced the cognitive tests and improved auditory-verbal working memory.
