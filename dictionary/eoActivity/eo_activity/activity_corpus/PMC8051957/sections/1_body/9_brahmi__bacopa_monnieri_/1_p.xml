 <italic>Bacopa monnieri (L.)</italic> also known as Brahmi, belongs to 
 <italic>Scrophulariaceae</italic> family, it is a creeping, succulent, herb cultivated in the wetlands of the Indian subcontinent.
 <xref rid="cit0065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref> Brahmi herbs have long been used in Indian Ayurvedic medicine to improve cognitive deficits related to brain aging. It has been demonstrated that Brahmi extract contains bacoside A, which has anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antistress, and antiepileptic actions.
 <xref rid="cit0066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref> The bacoside metabolites of Brahmi can cross the BBB easily and improve cognition by increasing blood flow, not necessarily due to direct interactions with neural cells. Holcomb et al evaluated the effect of the Brahmi extract on amyloid β-induced AD in PSAPP mice. The study findings revealed that Brahmi extract is able to reduce amyloid plaque in mice cortex, and reverse Y-maze performance and open field hyperlocomotion behavior.
 <xref rid="cit0067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref> Another study by Limpeanchob et al evaluated the protective effect of Brahmi on Aβ- induced cell death in primary cortical neurons. The study confirmed that the neuroprotective effect is being due to the suppression of neuronal oxidative stress and enhancing cholinergic activity.
 <xref rid="cit0068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref> Khan et al found that oral administration of Brahmi extract at 30mg/kg for 14 days significantly improved memory and learning capability, and ameliorated the morphological changes due to oxidative damage induced by intracerebroventricular-streptozotocin (ICV-STZ) in the brain tissue of rats. This neuroprotective effect of Brahmi was attributable to the upregulated expression of hippocampal antioxidant enzymes.
 <xref rid="cit0069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref> In a mouse model of trimethyltin (TMT)-induced neurodegeneration and cognition dysfunction, administration of 50 mg/kg/day of Brahmi extract significantly protected hippocampal neurons, enhanced neurogenesis, and improved cognitive performance in mice.
 <xref rid="cit0070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref> Uabundit et al explored beneficial cognitive effects of Brahmi extract against ethyl choline aziridinium ion mediated cognitive decline and neurodegenerative in rats. They observed a decline in both the number and density of cholinergic neurons and improvement in spatial learning and memory.
 <xref rid="cit0071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref> Bacoside treatment attenuated neurotoxicants (scopolamine, sodium nitrite, and platelet-activating factor antagonist)-induced amnesia, increased cholinergic activity, and reduced latency escape period in mice.
 <xref rid="cit0072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref> Brahmi has positive effects on the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and can improve cognitive functions in stroke and epileptic patients.
 <xref rid="cit0073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref> Among the plausible mechanisms behind the neuroprotective effect of 
 <italic>Brahmi</italic> are increasing glutathione expression and enhancing cerebral blood supply.
 <xref rid="cit0072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref> Oral administration 300 mg/day of standardized Brahmi extract in healthy elderly participants for 12 weeks significantly enhanced the cognitive tasks, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT), Stroop test, and depression scores, confirming its safety and memory-enhancing effects.
 <xref rid="cit0075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref> A randomized placebo-controlled trial has been conducted in India and enrolled 60 medical students to assess the impact of 
 <italic>Bacopa monnieri</italic> on improving cognition among medical students. 150 mg of standardized Brahmi extract (Bacognize
 <sup>®</sup>) twice daily for six weeks substantially improved auditory and visual neuropsychological tests and increased serum calcium compared to the control group.
 <xref rid="cit0076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref> A study performed by Thakkar et al to enhance the poor solubility of Bacognize
 <sup>®</sup>. Inclusion complex containing 16% bacosides and β-cyclodextrin at a molar ratio of 1:4 by co-precipitation method improved solubility and stability of Bacognize
 <sup>®</sup> by three times.
 <xref rid="cit0077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref> Poor learning and ADHD are very common childhood disorders in the Western world. Administration of 10 g Brahmi to 40 rural Indian school children aged 6–8 years for 3 months significantly enhanced memory and response performance.
 <xref rid="cit0078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref> Meta-analyses of randomized, double-blind, controlled trials demonstrated the beneficial effects of Brahmi on cognitive performance, particularly attention speed.
 <xref rid="cit0079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref> In contrast, a study reported that supplementation of Brahmi extract and multiple micronutrients twice daily for 4 months did not show a significant impact in improving short-term memory in Indian school children.
 <xref rid="cit0080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref> Despite the safety of Brahmi in animal studies and human trials, no studies regarding its safety in pregnancy, so it should not be used.
