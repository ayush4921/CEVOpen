<p>Substance abuse, subdural hematoma, intracranial tumors, neuro-infection, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and other neurodegenerative disorders are common causes of vascular dementias.

Moreover, the Î²-amyloid plaques (insoluble proteins) accumulate between the neurons and interact with cell membranes, which trigger the oxidative stress and free calcium levels, and eventually lead to neuronal cell death. Pesticides, air pollutants and industrial toxic chemicals that easily penetrate blood-brain barriers can induce oxidative stress, neuronal damage and increase the progression of dementia.
