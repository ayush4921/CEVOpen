<p>Dementia is a term that encompasses a group of clinical symptoms affecting memory, thinking and social abilities, characterized by progressive impairment of memory performance and cognitive functions. It has emerged as a major social and medical challenge that calls for urgent measures to establish its underlying pathogenesis and therapeutic interventions. There are several factors involved in the pathogenesis and progression of dementia, such as old age, brain ischemia, toxin exposure, and oxidative stress. Globally, around 50 million people are believed to be lived with dementia, with nearly 7.7 million new annual cases. The majority of them are poorly diagnosed and belong to low- and middle-income countries.

Herein, we review the pivotal role of common medicinal plants, which are widely used in various traditional systems of medicine as potential preventative or treatment strategies against dementia.
