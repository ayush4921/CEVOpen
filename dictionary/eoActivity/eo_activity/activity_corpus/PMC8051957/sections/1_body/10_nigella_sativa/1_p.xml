 <italic>Nigella sativa</italic> is a small black seed that belongs to the 
 <italic>Ranunculaceae</italic> family, native to Southern Europe, North Africa, and Asia Minor, and it is also cultivated in Pakistan and India. 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> has long been used in traditional medicine as astringent, diuretic, anthelmintic, and for the treatment of intermittent fever and skin disease.
 <xref rid="cit0083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref> Moreover, the therapeutic value of N. 
 <italic>sativa</italic> was mentioned in many chapters of the Prophetic medicine book. 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> contains a variety of constituents, including proteins, alkaloid, alpha-hederin, saponin, vitamins, minerals, volatile and fixed oils. Unsaturated fatty acids represent up to 26.6% to 38% of the total oil content.
 <xref rid="cit0084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref> Thymoquinone is the molecule of interest attributed to the pharmacological activities of the 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic>.
 <xref rid="cit0085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref> Thymol and carvacrol attenuated the disruption of cholinergic function and memory deficits induced by Aβ- and scopolamine in rats.
 <xref rid="cit0086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref> Emerging evidence confirms that flavonoids of 
 <italic>N.sativa</italic> are able to modulate specific changes in hippocampal protein expression involved in the learning and memory process.
 <xref rid="cit0087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref> A preclinical study was conducted by Hosseini et al to explore the protective mechanism of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> hydroalcoholic extract in scopolamine-induced spatial memory impairment in male Wistar rats. The study results explored that 
 <italic>N. Sativa</italic> purified oils enhanced memory performance, cholinergic activity, and reduced oxidative stress in rat brain tissues.
 <xref rid="cit0088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref> Similarly, a study performed by Khan et al to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of thymoquinone (3mg/kg body weight) for 15 days against streptozotocin-induced cognitive impairment in rats. The study findings revealed that thymoquinone reduced the levels of oxidative stress markers, and significantly decreased the latency time and the path length in the Morris Water Maze (MWM) test.
 <xref rid="cit0089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref> Thymoquinone (1.642 mg) ameliorated Aβ
 <sub>1–42</sub> induced neurotoxicity in rat hippocampal and cortical cultured neurons, and prevented the mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization.
 <xref rid="cit0090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref> A clinical study by Bin Sayeed et al has investigated the effect of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> on anxiety and cognitive decline. The study findings reported that oral intake of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> 500 mg/day over four weeks as a nutritional supplement was found to stabilize mood, decrease anxiety and modulate cognition on adolescent human male participants.
 <xref rid="cit0091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref> Taken together, these collective evidences put thymoquinone in the top list of phytopharmaceuticals as a promising candidate for the treatment of dementia and AD.
