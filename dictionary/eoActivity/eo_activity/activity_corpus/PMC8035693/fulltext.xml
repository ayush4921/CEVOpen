Nowadays, there is a turn towards the investigation of natural products (i.e., essential oils, organic acids, and edible coatings) in an effort to lower the usage of chemical synthetic compounds (i.e., chlorine) as postharvest sanitizers. The aim of the present study was to assess the effectiveness of <italic>Origanum majorana</italic> essential oil (EO), ascorbic acid (AA), chitosan, and their combinations on quality attributes of fresh-cut lettuce stored for six days at 7 &#x000b0;C. When applied, Chitosan+AA resulted to a less acceptable product (visual quality and aroma), while the application of marjoram EO was able to preserve the visual quality of fresh-cut lettuce and at the same time resulted in a pleasant aroma. The application of EO+AA and Chitosan+AA increased total phenolics and antioxidant levels of fresh-cut lettuce on the fourth and sixth day of storage. The EO and EO+AA increased damage index (hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxidation) of fresh-cut lettuce, while at the same time these treatments decreased the activity of enzymes related with plant tissue browning (i.e., peroxidase activity and polyphenol oxidase). Chitosan decreased total valuable counts and yeasts and molds counts on the sixth day of storage, while EO, AA, EO+Chitosan, and Chitosan+AA decreased yeasts and molds after four days of application. The findings of the present work indicating that the combination of marjoram EO, AA, and chitosan could be considered further as alternative means for fresh-cut produce preservation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>minimally processed lettuce</kwd><kwd><italic>Origanum majorana</italic> oil</kwd><kwd>ascorbic acid</kwd><kwd>chitosan</kwd><kwd>food quality</kwd><kwd>enzymes activity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-foods-10-00575"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Over the last few years, the market of fresh-cut produce has been growing dramatically as the increased consumer demand for fresh, safe, healthy (high nutritional value), and convenient food [<xref rid="B1-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Vegetables (including leafy, roots, and other plants&#x02019; part) that are intended to be marketed as &#x0201c;fresh-cut&#x0201d; are subjected to washing, peeling, slicing, and shredding followed by packing and sealing in polymeric films [<xref rid="B2-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Lettuce is quite popular and consumed widely due to its crispness, pleasant aroma, and high levels of phytonutrients, such as phenolic components and vitamins (C, K, and folate). However, lettuce is a very perishable vegetable, and when processed and/or stored at less favored conditions (i.e., high temperature, low humidity, and improper packaging material) it is susceptible to physiological disorders, enzymatic browning, loss of nutritional value, microbial contamination, and spoilage [<xref rid="B1-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B3-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Several studies assessed the microbial quality of ready-to eat vegetables and salads revealing a broad range of microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, and viruses) that can possible adversely affect product quality (spoilage) and/or threaten human health (foodborne pathogens) [<xref rid="B5-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>The washing procedure during minimal processing is performed using chlorinated water which contains 0.05&#x02013;0.2 g L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> sodium hypochloride (NaOCl), and the applied dose (concentration and time of application) depends on the product (fresh produce) [<xref rid="B9-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The main aim of washing is the reduction of the microbial load of vegetables [<xref rid="B2-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, as it has been previously reported, chlorine can cause the production of undesirable and harmful by-products like trihalomethanes, haloketones, chlorophorm, and halloacetic acids with adverse effects in human health as well as the environment [<xref rid="B2-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B10-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This has led to increased concern and demand for natural alternatives to replace chemicals used in the food industry and meet consumers&#x02019; needs. These alternatives might include essential oils (EOs) from medicinal and aromatic plants, organic acids (ascorbic, oxalic, and lactic acid), peptides, reducing agents (ascorbic acid and cysteine), and more [<xref rid="B2-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B11-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Ascorbic acid (AA) is being extensively used in the food industry mainly as a reducing agent in order to prevent undesirable reactions such as enzymatic browning. As with other organic acids (i.e., citric and oxalic acid), AA has been used during processing in order to regulate the microbial load of fresh commodities due to its antioxidant activity as well as its ability to lower the pH of washing water [<xref rid="B2-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B16-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B18-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The application of AA on fresh-cut lettuce has been previously reported with promising results [<xref rid="B18-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. For instance, Altunkaya and G&#x000f6;kmen [<xref rid="B18-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] reported that AA maintained high phenolic content of fresh-cut lettuce indicating lower phenol oxidation levels due to enzymatic activity and thus lower browning on cut surfaces. In another study, the bright green color of lettuce was maintained with the application of AA [<xref rid="B20-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Essential oils are plants&#x02019; secondary metabolites that have been used for prolonging food shelf life and improving organoleptic attributes (aroma and taste) of food as many of them are characterized as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) [<xref rid="B22-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. They possess antioxidant and amicrobial activity among others and can be used in low levels that are safe for consumption [<xref rid="B23-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The application of EOs on fresh produce has been previously mentioned and several research studies have tested the impacts of EO application on fresh-cut lettuce [<xref rid="B4-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B13-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B24-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The application of EOs on minimally processed vegetables such as lamb&#x02019;s lettuce, shredded carrot, sliced cucumber, and broccoli has been previously reported with encouraging results [<xref rid="B15-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B26-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. For example, the use of marjoram EO and hydrosol when combined with AA improved the quality of shredded carrot stored at 4 &#x000b0;C for nine days [<xref rid="B15-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Chitosan is a naturally occurring polymer delivered from crab shells, and it has been employed to stabilize ingredients in tablets in medicines. Chitosan was the first basic compound for plant protection that was approved by the European Union (Reg. EU 2014/563) due to its low toxicity and when applied to plants its effectiveness results from three mechanisms (film formation, antimicrobial activity, and elicitation of host defense) [<xref rid="B28-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. It has been previously shown that edible chitosan coatings alone or incorporated with EOs presented enhanced antimicrobial activity against foodborne pathogens including <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic>, <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic>, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic>, and <italic>Salmonella enteritidis</italic> [<xref rid="B29-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Chitosan has been proven to act as an elicitor of plant defense mechanisms when applied to plant tissues and this forms a protection against pre- and postharvest microbial contamination and spoilage of strawberry fruit as reported by Landi et al. [<xref rid="B30-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Chitosan and commercial chitosan formulations have been previously applied to fresh produce (dipping and spraying) with encouraging results [<xref rid="B31-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].

Previous indications have shown that lettuce produces very little ethylene and at the same time it is sensitive to the presence of ethylene [<xref rid="B3-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Interestingly, Hamanaka and Izumi [<xref rid="B57-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] examining the effects of mustard and hop extracts on shredded cabbage and sliced cucumber reported lower respiration rates and ethylene production in both products.</p><p>Among fresh produce quality attribute, color, and appearance are the most important ones, as they are the first attributes perceived by consumers and can affect their buying decision [<xref rid="B58-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The degree of browning in vegetables can be assessed using the <italic>L*</italic>, <italic>a*</italic>, and <italic>b*</italic> chromaticity coordinates. As previously mentioned by Chen et al. [<xref rid="B4-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], browning might occur with lower <italic>L*</italic> and higher <italic>a*</italic> and <italic>b*</italic> values. Decreased <italic>L*</italic> values were observed with the use of chitosan and Chitosan+AA, while high <italic>a*</italic>, <italic>b*</italic>, and hue values were also noted suggesting a darker (less green) leaf and the formation of brown pigments. Similarly, CI and chroma values decreased with the application of chitosan and its combinations (EO+Chitosan, Chitosan+AA) and at the same time increased browning index was observed with chitosan. All these results indicated the development and the degradation of lettuce visual quality. The application of AA increased WI of fresh-cut lettuce. Chen et al. [<xref rid="B4-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] reported that the application of clove essential oil (0.05%) and eugenol (0.05%) on fresh-cut lettuce maintained its bright green color during 12 days of storage at 4 &#x000b0;C with high <italic>L*</italic> and <italic>b*</italic> values, as well as lower <italic>a*</italic> values. On the same study, lower browning index values were also found after the use of clove EO and eugenol, compared to the 5% ethanol treatment [<xref rid="B4-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In another study by Martin-Diana et al. [<xref rid="B11-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], they reported that 3% whey permeate applied on fresh-cut lettuce resulted in high <italic>a*</italic> values compared to lower concentrations; however, <italic>b*</italic> value, hue, and chroma value did not vary. Viacava et al. [<xref rid="B13-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] reported that thyme EO treatment resulted in lower <italic>L*</italic> values, while the microencapsulation of thyme EO did not affect negatively fresh-cut lettuce green color throughout storage (up to 12 days) at 5 &#x000b0;C, suggesting that the combination of film forming compounds can enhance/improve EOs attributes.</p><p>Total soluble solids were reduced on the second and fourth day of storage with chitosan application. As reported previously by Moreira et al. [<xref rid="B59-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], the decrease in TSS might be associated with respiration rate and the consumption of sugars during this process. In the present study little to no relation between respiration rate and TSS of fresh-cut lettuce was observed, as respiration rate slightly increased on the second day, while it significantly decreased on the fourth day of storage with the application of chitosan. Lettuce&#x02019;s total acidity increased with EO and chlorine application after four days stored at 7 &#x000b0;C, whereas sweetness decreased with the application of chlorine on the fourth and sixth day of storage. According to Zhao et al. [<xref rid="B27-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], treatment with melatonin incorporated in a chitosan based bilayer coating (2.5% <italic>w/v</italic>) maintained the sugar&#x02013;acid ratio (ripening index-sweetness) of fresh cut cucumber. In a previous study, the application of marjoram EO+AA and marjoram Hydrosol+AA increased shredded carrots TSS compared to the hydrosol when applied alone, while increased TA was reported with the application of AA [<xref rid="B15-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It seems that when natural products are applied on minimal processed fresh produce, they can differently affect quality parameters depending on their properties, the time of application or the product they are applied on, and tailor-made investigations are needed for each commodity.</p><p>One of the main issues in fresh-cut vegetable processing is the browning of the cut surface which is an undesirable feature leading to reduced marketability products (darkening and softening), loss of nutritional value, and the development of off-flavors [<xref rid="B21-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B46-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Browning results from enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions that are favored by the disruption of plant cell wall during processing and the exposure of phenolic compounds to oxygen and enzymes [<xref rid="B18-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B60-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The effects of natural products as anti-browning agents applied on fresh produce have been previously assessed [<xref rid="B4-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B18-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B21-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B46-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B61-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The application of oxalic and ascorbic acid on lettuce aliquots maintained phenolic content on high levels compared to citric acid and cysteine application [<xref rid="B18-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In this study, the application of EO+AA and Chitosan+AA combinations increased lettuce&#x02019;s phenolic content after four and six days of storage. Interestingly, in a study by Viacava et al. [<xref rid="B13-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] it has been shown that the application of thyme EO on minimally processed lettuce increased total phenolics, total flavonoids, and antioxidant capacity. Ascorbic acid and carotenoid content were increased with the use of EO+AA. According to Altunkaya and G&#x000f6;kmen [<xref rid="B18-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], color changes have been linked with the degradation of ascorbic acid and this might explain the positive effects of EO and EO+AA on the color of fresh-cut lettuce throughout storage time. Interestingly, fresh-cut lettuce&#x02019;s chlorophylls decreased during storage, though the application of Chitosan+AA and EO maintained their levels up to the last day of storage. Another study reported that high green-tea extract concentration (up to 1% <italic>w/v</italic>) prevented ascorbic acid and carotenoid loss of fresh-cut lettuce [<xref rid="B61-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].</p><p>Antioxidant activity of fresh-cut lettuce increased with the application of EO+AA. It has been shown that AA can react and scavenge radicals and regenerate polyphenols after their oxidation, due to its antioxidant activity [<xref rid="B18-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B62-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Furthermore, EOs possess antioxidant activity among others, thus when applied alone or in combination with AA might have resulted to higher phenolic content and antioxidant levels when applied to fresh-cut lettuce. In a previous study, it has been shown that the application of spearmint and lavender EO and their mixture on endive leaves at concentrations as low as 0.001% resulted in lower antioxidant capacity compared to higher concentrations (up to 0.1%) where decreased antioxidants were reported [<xref rid="B49-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. As it has been previously mentioned by Kang and Saltveit [<xref rid="B63-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], wounding of plant tissue can result in increased antioxidant activity in romaine and iceberg lettuce. The application of eugenol, carvacrol, and trans-anethole on cellulose sachets resulted in higher phenolic content as well as antioxidant capacity of fresh-cut iceberg lettuce when exposed to them [<xref rid="B64-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. These findings suggest that the applied processing methods might induce defense mechanisms of plant tissue (i.e., increase in antioxidant capacity) that will lead to rapid deterioration and quality losses. This seems to be associated with the applied method, the time of application, the processing product, and the storage conditions, among other parameters.</p><p>The production of active oxygen species (i.e., H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, superoxide-O<sup>2&#x02022;-</sup>, hydroxyl-OH<sup>&#x02022;</sup>, singlet oxygen-<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) has been linked with lipid peroxidation, production of brown pigments and core browning, pigment bleaching (chlorophyll and carotenoids), and other processes that lower postharvest quality of fruit and vegetables [<xref rid="B56-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="B65-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="B66-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="B67-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. In this study, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was increased with the use of EO, AA, and their combination (EO+AA) on the second day, while decreased H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels were revealed with the use of Chitosan+AA at the end of storage. Increased lipid peroxidation was also found with Chitosan+AA on the second day, whereas EO application showed lower MDA levels after six day of storage at 7 &#x000b0;C. An increase in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and MDA levels was reported during storage of fresh-cut rocket and melon at 4 and 20 &#x000b0;C with MDA levels lower than 0.3 nmol g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> fresh weight, which suggested a moderate lipid peroxidation level according to Cavaiuolo et al. [<xref rid="B68-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Noticeably, Ferrante et al. [<xref rid="B69-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] reported higher lipid peroxidation values on fresh-cut lamb&#x02019;s lettuce leaves compared to intact ones, when stored at 4 &#x000b0;C up to 8 d (values up to 0.041&#x02013;0.051 nmol kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> MDA), confirming that processing (i.e., cutting) induces plant stress and increases lipid peroxidation that utterly result to low quality products presenting postharvest disorders such as tissue browning and leaf yellowing. Additionally, in another study the use of AA when combined with marjoram EO and hydrosol increased the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and MDA levels of shredded carrots suggesting that applied treatments might also induce oxidative stress and affect the quality of the end product [<xref rid="B15-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Fresh-cut lettuce is prone to enzymatic browning and has been associated with the activity of three enzymes: polyphenol oxidase, peroxidase, and phenylalanine ammonia lyase-PAL [<xref rid="B46-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The use of natural products, i.e., ascorbic acid and EOs as anti-browning agents has been previously studied and results are promising [<xref rid="B4-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B46-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B70-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,<xref rid="B71-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Chen et al. [<xref rid="B4-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] reported that the application of 0.05% clove EO and eugenol (used alone) decreased fresh-cut lettuce browning by significantly inhibiting the activities of PAL, PPO, and POD. The use of phytoncide (EO derived from pine leaves) (1% diluted in 95% ethanol) was able to decrease the activity of PPO, POD, and PAL of fresh-cut lettuce stored at 12 days at 4 &#x000b0;C. In our study, EO+AA and EO+Chitosan decreased POD activity on the fourth day of storage, while EO, EO+Chitosan, EO+AA, and Chitosan+AA also decreased POD activity on the last day of storage. The application of AA in the present study was found to increase CAT activity, while Chitosan+AA decreased POD and increased PPO activity. It has been suggested that AA does not interact directly with PPO, as it can reduce o-quinones (enzymatically produced) to their precursor diphenols [<xref rid="B72-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. A study by Li et al. [<xref rid="B73-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] showed that polysaccharide-based edible coatings (alginate, chitosan, and carrageenan) are able to inhibit fresh-cut lettuce enzymatic browning by maintaining total phenols content as well as decreasing PPO and PAL activities throughout storage. In the same study, it was suggested that among the studied edible coatings, chitosan (1%) was the most effective [<xref rid="B73-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Interestingly, increased SOD and POD, and at the same time decreased PPO activity, was reported throughout storage (up to 15 days at 4 &#x000b0;C), with the application of 1% chitosan on cut lettuce [<xref rid="B73-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. In our study, the combination of Chitosan+AA and Chitosan+EO increased PPO activity during the second and fourth day of storage, respectively. Moreover, the findings in our study suggest that the Chitosan+AA increased SOD activity on the second day, while when chitosan was applied alone resulted in decreased SOD and CAT activity on the fourth day of storage.</p><p>Many studies have assessed the antimicrobial effects of EOs on the microbial load of fresh produce [<xref rid="B13-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B24-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], indicating the importance of safe and high-quality produce for the consumer. For instance, the application of thyme EO on minimally processed lettuce exhibited high bacteriostatic activity against mesophilic and psychtotrophic bacteria, <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>, and yeast and molds counts [<xref rid="B13-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In another study, thyme and tea tree EOs used alone or in combination resulted to great reduction of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> O157:H7 population (up to 2 log) inoculated on fresh lettuce leaves stored at 10 &#x000b0;C [<xref rid="B74-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Bagamboula et al. [<xref rid="B24-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] reported that thyme and basil EOs at the concentrations applied (0.5 and 1%) were able to reduce both inoculated (<italic>Shigella sonnei</italic> and <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic>) and indigenous flora populations on fresh-cut lettuce (up to 2 log reduction). On the other hand, one of the main activities chitosan exhibits when applied to plants is its antimicrobial activity, and it has been previously assessed by researchers against a wide range of microorganisms [<xref rid="B28-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Go&#x000f1;i et al. [<xref rid="B75-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] reported that the preharvest application of chitosan (0.1% <italic>w/v</italic>) during the last development stages controlled lettuce&#x02019;s native microflora, as well as reduced <italic>E. coli</italic> survival inoculated on the edible plant parts. Another study reported lower microbial load of total bacteria and the presence of <italic>Salmonella</italic> in ready-to eat lettuce when treated with allyl- and benzyl-isothiocyanates and chitosan [<xref rid="B76-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. In the present study, chitosan decreased lettuce&#x02019;s TVC and yeast and mold counts after six days of storage at 7 &#x000b0;C. In addition, EO, along with EO+Chitosan, EO+AA, and Chitosan+AA, resulted in lower yeast and molds counts on the fourth day of storage, highlighting the antimicrobial activities of the examined natural compounds. These results are in accordance with studies that suggest that when chitosan is applied alone or in combination with antimicrobial compounds can inhibit microbial growth [<xref rid="B32-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B77-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>].

Conclusions</title><p>The natural-based products used in the current study (marjoram EO, AA, and chitosan) and the outcomes of their application on fresh-cut lettuce provide encouraging evidence for the use of natural compounds in the food industry. Marjoram EO improved aroma and visual quality of lightly processed lettuce, while chitosan used alone negatively affected lettuce color. The combination of EO+AA increased phenolic, ascorbic, and carotenoid contend as well as the antioxidant status of fresh-cut lettuce, thus improving its nutritional value. Interestingly, chitosan, EO, EO+Chitosan, and Chitosan+AA presented antimicrobial activity against TVC and yeast and molds counts of minimally processed lettuce. The findings of this study are promising as the combination of natural products with antioxidant and antimicrobial activities is gaining interest for the maintenance of postharvest quality of fresh commodities and lightly processed vegetables. EO encapsulation could possibly be considered in future studies in order to increase the EO effectiveness during postharvest applications.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><app-group><app id="app1-foods-10-00575"><title>Supplementary Materials</title><p>The following are available online at <uri xlink:href="https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/10/3/575/s1">https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/10/3/575/s1</uri>, Figure S1: Application of chitosan (0.5&#x02013;1%) on fresh-cut lettuce (preliminary test for determining the time of application: 1&#x02013;5&#x02013;10 min), Figure S2: Screening of marjoram essential oil (EO), chitosan (Chit) and ascorbic acid (AA) on fresh-cut lettuce weight loss (%), Figure S3: Preliminary screening of marjoram essential oil (EO), chitosan and ascorbic acid (AA) on fresh-cut lettuce color, Figure S4: Impact of marjoram essential oil (EO), chitosan, and ascorbic acid (AA) alone and their combinations on fresh-cut lettuce color.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="foods-10-00575-s001"><media xlink:href="foods-10-00575-s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></app></app-group><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Conceptualization, P.X. and N.T.; methodology, P.X. and A.C.; software, P.X.; validation, P.X., A.C., and N.T.; formal analysis, P.X.; investigation, P.X. and A.C.; resources, P.X. and N.T.; data curation, P.X. and A.C.; writing&#x02014;original draft preparation, P.X.; writing&#x02014;review and editing, A.C. and N.T.; visualization, A.C.; supervision, A.C. and N.T.; project administration, N.T.; funding acquisition, N.T.
