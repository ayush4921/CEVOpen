<p>The application of Chitosan+AA increased SOD activity of lettuce compared to other treatments on the second day, while on the fourth day chitosan and EO+AA decreased SOD activity (1.32 and 1.07 units mg
 <sup>−1</sup> protein, respectively) compared to control (1.68 units mg
 <sup>−1</sup> protein) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00575-f007">Figure 7</xref>C). On the last day of storage, SOD activity was decreased with AA, EO+AA, and chlorine compared to control. AA increased CAT activity on the second day of storage compared to control, while Chitosan+AA and chlorine decreased CAT activity on the last day in comparison to the control (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00575-f007">Figure 7</xref>E). Chitosan, EO+Chitosan, EO+AA, Chitosan+AA, and chlorine decreased POD activity on the fourth day of storage, while EO, EO+Chitosan, EO+AA, and Chitosan+AA also decreased its activity on the last day of storage. Chitosan+AA application led to increased PPO activity on the second day of storage (113.07 units mg
 <sup>−1</sup> protein), while deceased enzyme’s activity was found on the last day of storage compared to control (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00575-f007">Figure 7</xref>F). Moreover, the application of AA, EO+AA, and chlorine decreased PPO activity after the second day and throughout storage, while EO, EO+Chitosan application increased PPO activity after the fourth day of storage.
