 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00575-f009">Figure 9</xref> presents the impacts of the applied treatments on the aroma and visual quality of fresh-cut lettuce. The combination of Chitosan+AA scored higher values (4 out of a 5 scale) than all the applied treatments during the fourth and sixth days of storage, indicating a non-acceptable product (

Furthermore, the application of EO scored lower values during all days suggesting an acceptable product with a pleasant/acceptable aroma (1–2 out of a 5 scale). Moreover, the visual quality of fresh-cut lettuce decreased with the application of Chitosan+AA and chitosan, as these treatments were scored higher with high values (3–4 out of a 5 scale) during all days of storage (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-foods-10-00575">Figure S4</xref>). Increased values were also revealed with the use of AA during the fourth and sixth day (3 out of a 5 scale), while EO application preserved the visual quality of fresh-cut lettuce during all days of storage (scores 1–2 out of a 5 scale) (
