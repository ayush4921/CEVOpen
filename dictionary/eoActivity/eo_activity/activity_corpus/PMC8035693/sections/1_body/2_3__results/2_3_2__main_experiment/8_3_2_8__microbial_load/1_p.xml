 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00575-f008">Figure 8</xref> shows the impacts of the preservative means applied on fresh-cut lettuce microbial quality. Chitosan application resulted to decreased total viable counts (4.58 log CFU g
 <sup>−1</sup>) during the last day of storage (

 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively) on the fourth day of storage compared with the control treatment, while chitosan and chlorine decreased yeast and molds compared to control, EO, AA, EO+Chitosan, and EO+AA on the sixth day (
