<p>Total phenols content was increased with the use of AA 2%, 1%, and 0.5% and EO from 1:1000 to 1:2500 compared to the control treatment after 2 days of storage, while chitosan 1% resulted to lower phenolics on the same day (

During the fourth day of storage an increase of phenols was found with the application of EO 1:2000, AA 2%, 1% and 0.5%, and chitosan 0.1% compared to the control treatment. Phenolic content was higher after 6 days with the application of AA 2%, 1%, and 0.5%, while the application of AA 0.25% decreased the phenolic content compared to the control treatment. On the same day, decreased phenolics were reported with the application of chitosan 1%, 0.5%, and 0.25%, while no significant difference was found between the application of EO and the control treatment.
