<p>The effects of the applied preservative means on the visual quality and aroma of fresh-cut lettuce are illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00575-f001">Figure 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-foods-10-00575">Figure S3</xref>. EO and AA (2% and 1%, respectively) applications maintained the green color of fresh-cut lettuce throughout storage (up to 6 days). The application of chitosan on higher concentrations (1% and 0.5%) resulted to higher scores on the fourth and sixth day of storage compared to other treatments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00575-f001">Figure 1</xref>C). Note that chitosan 1% scored 4 out of a 5 scale reflecting the incidence of browning on fresh-cut lettuce from the second day of storage. Moreover, the application of chitosan 0.5 and 1% after four and six days of storage resulted in a product scored with 3 out of a 5 scale, which indicated an acceptable aroma but not lettuce like (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00575-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). On the other hand, the application of AA and EO 1:1000 and 1:1500 revealed a lettuce like (“freshness”) aroma scoring 1 and 2 out of a 5 scale.
