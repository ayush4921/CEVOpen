<p>The impact of marjoram EO, chitosan, and AA application and their combinations on fresh-cut lettuce color is illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00575-f003">Figure 3</xref>. The utilization of EO increased 
 <italic>L*</italic> value compared to chitosan and Chitosan+AA after 6 days of storage (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00575-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). Lower 
 <italic>a*</italic> values (positive values are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00575-f003">Figure 3</xref>B) were reported on the sixth day of storage with the application of chitosan and Chitosan+AA. Similarly, decreased 
 <italic>b*</italic> values (positive values are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00575-f003">Figure 3</xref>C) were observed with the utilization of chitosan, EO+Chitosan and Chitosan+AA. Chroma value decreased with the application of chitosan, EO+Chitosan, and Chitosan+AA on the sixth day, while increased CI value (positive values are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00575-f003">Figure 3</xref>D,E) was reported with the application of chitosan compared to EO, AA, and chlorine on the same day. Chitosan application decreased Hue (59.16) compared to the application of AA and chlorine (61.92 and 61.80, respectively) on the sixth day (positive values are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00575-f003">Figure 3</xref>F). Browning index decreased on the 6th day with the application of chitosan compared to the control treatment, while WI increased by using AA compared to EO+Chitosan and chlorine on the second day (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00575-f003">Figure 3</xref>G,H). On the fourth day of storage, AA was found to have an increased WI in comparison to EO application.
