<p>Ethylene emission as affected by the application of the natural products is illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00575-f002">Figure 2</xref>C. The application of EO resulted to lower ethylene production compared to the control and EO+Chitosan treatments on the second day of storage. On the fourth day, increased ethylene emission was reported with the combination of EO+AA as to the control treatment, EO and Chitosan+AA, while on the sixth day, the application of EO+Chitosan resulted to higher ethylene production compared to all treatments.
