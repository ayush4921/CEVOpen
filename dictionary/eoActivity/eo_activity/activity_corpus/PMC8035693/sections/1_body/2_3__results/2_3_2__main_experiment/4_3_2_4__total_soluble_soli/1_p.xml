<p>Total soluble solids of fresh-cut lettuce were decreased with the application of chitosan on the second day of storage, while EO application increased TSS compared to chitosan, Chitosan+AA, and chlorine on the fourth day (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00575-f005">Figure 5</xref>C, sweetness increased with the combination of Chitosan+AA and chlorine as to chitosan on the second day of storage, while the chlorine decreased sweetness of fresh-cut lettuce on the fourth day when compared to the control treatment, EO, and EO+AA. Similarly, on the sixth day of storage chlorine caused decreased sweetness opposed to the control treatment and chitosan.
