<p>The antioxidant capacity of fresh-cut lettuce decreased with the application of chitosan, EO+Chitosan and EO+AA (DPPH: 0.79, 0.86, and 0.89 g kg
 <sup>−1</sup> trolox, respectively) compared to the control treatment and AA (1.46 and 1.45 g kg
 <sup>−1</sup> trolox, respectively) on the second day (

Similarly, the application of EO+AA, Chitosan+AA, and chlorine increased DPPH antioxidants during the sixth day. The AA application increased lettuce antioxidants on the second day compared to the application of chitosan and EO+AA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00575-f006">Figure 6</xref>D), while the combinations of EO+AA and Chitosan+AA resulted to higher ABTS compared to control, EO, EO+Chitosan, and chlorine during the fourth day. However, Chitosan and EO+Chitosan lowered lettuce ABTS antioxidants during the last day of storage compared to EO, EO+AA, Chitosan+AA, and chlorine.
