<p>The effects of postharvest treatments applied on fresh-cut lettuce chlorophyll content are illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00575-f004">Figure 4</xref>. All applied treatments except EO decreased chlorophyll content (Chl a, Chl b, Tot Chl) on the sixth day of storage. Chitosan application decreased Chl b levels compared to Chitosan+AA on the second day, while the same trend on the same day was observed with Chl a content (
