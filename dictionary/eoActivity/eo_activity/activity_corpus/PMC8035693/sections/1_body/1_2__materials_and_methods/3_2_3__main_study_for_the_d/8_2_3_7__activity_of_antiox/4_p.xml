<p>Peroxidase activity (POD, EC 1.11.1.7) was assayed using pyrogallol as a substrate [
 <xref rid="B45-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The increase in absorbance at 430 nm was monitored for 3 min. One POD unit was defined as the amount of enzyme that decomposes 1 μmol of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> per min. Results were expressed as units of POD per milligram of protein (coefficient of extinction of 2.47 mM cm
 <sup>−1</sup>).
