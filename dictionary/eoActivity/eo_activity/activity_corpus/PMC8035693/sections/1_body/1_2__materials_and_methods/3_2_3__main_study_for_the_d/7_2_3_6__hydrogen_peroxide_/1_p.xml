<p>The concentration of hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) was quantified based to the method described previously by Loreto and Velikova [
 <xref rid="B41-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] at 390 nm and results were expressed as nmol of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> per kg of fresh weight (nmol kg
 <sup>−1</sup> H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>). Lipid peroxidation of minimally processed lettuce was evaluated using the 2-thiobarbituric acid reactive substances method measuring the absorbance at 532 and 600 nm as previously described [
 <xref rid="B42-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], using a spectrophotometer (Multiskan GO, Thermo Fisher Scientific Oy, Finland). Results were expressed as nmol of malondialdeyde (MDA) per kg of fresh weight (nmol kg
 <sup>−1</sup> MDA).
