<p>For the preparation of crude extracts, fresh leaf samples were homogenized with ice cold 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 1% 
 <italic>w/v</italic> polyvinylpolypyrrolidone, and 0.05% polyethylene glycol tert-octylphenyl ether (Triton X-100). The homogenate was transferred to centrifuge tubes and was centrifuged at 16,000× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min, at 4 °C [
