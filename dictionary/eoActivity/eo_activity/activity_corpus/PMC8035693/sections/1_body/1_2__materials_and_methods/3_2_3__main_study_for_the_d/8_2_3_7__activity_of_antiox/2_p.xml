<p>Catalase activity (CAT, EC 1.11.1.6) was measured according to Jiang and Zhang [
 <xref rid="B44-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], following the consumption of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> at 240 nm, for 3 min. Results were expressed as CAT units per milligram of protein. One unit of enzyme decomposes 1 μmol of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> per min (coefficient of extinction 39.4 mM cm
 <sup>−1</sup>).
