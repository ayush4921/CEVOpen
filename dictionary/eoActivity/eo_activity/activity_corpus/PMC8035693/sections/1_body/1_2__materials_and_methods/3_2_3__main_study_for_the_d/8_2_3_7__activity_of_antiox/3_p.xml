<p>The photochemical method was used to determine the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1), as described by Chrysargyris et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. SOD activity was calculated from the absorbance of the reaction mixture at 560 nm, as compared to the control. Results were expressed as SOD units per mg of protein, while one unit of SOD was defined as the enzyme inhibiting the NBT reduction by 50%.
