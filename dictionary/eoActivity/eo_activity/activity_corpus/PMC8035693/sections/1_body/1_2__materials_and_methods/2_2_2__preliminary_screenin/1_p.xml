<p>After the removal of damaged exterior leaves, fresh lettuce leaves were chopped into pieces (5 × 10 cm) and washed with tap water. Then, 70 g of fresh-cut leaves was dipped for 1 min (based on preliminary tests following evaluation for the dipping time of 1, 5, and 10 min during a 4-day storage, as presented in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-foods-10-00575">Figure S1</xref>) into 0.5 L of treatment solution. The following 14 dipping solutions were studied: (1) distilled water (control), (2) marjoram EO (1:1000, 1:1500, 1:2000, and 1:2500

 <italic>w/v</italic>), and (4) ascorbic acid (Scharlau, Spain) (0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2% 
 <italic>w/v</italic>). Afterwards, leaf pieces were drained, and ~15 g was placed in a polypropylene plastic container (1 L) and enclosed into a polyethylene terephthalate plastic tray and stored at 7 °C and 90% RH until the day of sampling (days 0, 2, 4, and 6). Three biological replicates for each treatment/concentration were sampled and plant tissue was stored at −20 °C until analysis. For preliminary screening, aroma and marketability were assessed by seven untrained panelists, while weight loss and total polyphenol content were determined and used for choosing the adequate dipping solutions for further assessment.
