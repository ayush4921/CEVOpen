 <sup>−1</sup> GAE). The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) assays were used for the determination of antioxidant activity of lettuce methanolic extracts. The antioxidant capacity using the DPPH method was determined at 517 nm as previously described by Wojdylo et al. [
