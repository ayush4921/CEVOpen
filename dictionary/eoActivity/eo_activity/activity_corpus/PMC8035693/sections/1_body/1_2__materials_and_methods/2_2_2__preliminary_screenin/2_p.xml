<p>Lettuce weight loss was monitored every second day during storage at 7 °C for 6 d (days 0, 2, 4, and 6) and results were presented as percentage of total weight loss. After storage for 6 d overall aroma and chroma/color (visual quality) were scored. Evaluation of aroma was assessed with a 5-point hedonic scale (0.5 interval) where 5 = not acceptable; 3 = not lettuce but acceptable; 1 = lettuce. Visual quality was evaluated with a 5-point hedonic scale (0.5 interval) where 5 = severe browning; 3 = light discoloration; 1 = green. Total phenols content of methanolic extracts was determined at 755 nm using a spectrophotometer (Multiskan GO, Thermo Fisher Scientific Oy, Vantaa, Finland), as previously described by Marinou et al. [

 <sup>−1</sup> GAE).
