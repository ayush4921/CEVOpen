<p>Following preliminary screening, lettuce leaves were selected, prepared, and processed as above. Then, ~70 g of fresh-cut lettuce was dipped for 1 min into 0.5 L of treatment solution selected from the preliminary screening. The following eight dipping solutions/combinations were further assessed: (1) distilled water (control), (2) marjoram EO (1:1500

 <italic>w/v</italic>), (5) marjoram EO (1:1500) + chitosan (0.1%), (6) marjoram EO (1:1500) + ascorbic acid (1%), (7) chitosan (0.1%) + ascorbic acid (1%), and (8) chlorine (0.2 mL L
 <sup>−1</sup>). Afterwards, lettuce pieces were drained, and ~70 g of lettuce pieces was placed into a polypropylene plastic tray and stored at 7 °C and 90% RH until the day of sampling (days 0, 2, 4, and 6). Three biological replicates per treatment/day were sampled, while appropriate amount of tissue was stored at −20 °C until analysis.
