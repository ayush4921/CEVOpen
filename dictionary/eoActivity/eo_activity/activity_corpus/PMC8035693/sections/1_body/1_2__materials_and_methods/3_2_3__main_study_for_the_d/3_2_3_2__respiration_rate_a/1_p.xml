<p>Respiration of the fresh-cut lettuce was evaluated by measuring the CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentration as previously described [
 <xref rid="B15-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Briefly, samples were enclosed in a polypropylene plastic container (1 L) at room temperature for 1 h, container’s air was withdrawing by a dual gas analyzer (GCS 250 Analyzer, International Control Analyser Ltd., Kent, UK) for 40 s and respiration rate was expressed as mg of CO
 <sub>2</sub> per kg of fresh weight per h (mg kg
 <sup>−1</sup> h
 <sup>−1</sup> CO
 <sub>2</sub>) according to the volume and weight of the processed lettuce. Ethylene flow rate was estimated by measuring the ethylene concentration of the packages as previously mentioned by Chrysargyris et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Briefly, air was withdrawn from sample containers by an ethylene analyzer (ICA 56 Analyser, International Control Analyser Ltd., Kent, UK) for 20 s through a hole on the lid recording the ppm of ethylene produced, and ethylene emission was computed as μg of ethylene per kg of fresh weight per h (μg kg
 <sup>−1</sup> h
 <sup>−1</sup> ethylene).
