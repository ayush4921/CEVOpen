<p>Marjoram plants (
 <italic>Origanum majorana</italic> L.) grown in soil for two years were harvested from the experimental farm of Cyprus University of Technology. Plant tissue was air-dried (in oven at 42 °C) and chopped, and hydrodistillation was performed using Clevenger apparatus for 3 h for the extraction of the EO. The obtained EO was stored at −20 °C until use in amber glass vials. Essential oil composition was determined as described previously [
