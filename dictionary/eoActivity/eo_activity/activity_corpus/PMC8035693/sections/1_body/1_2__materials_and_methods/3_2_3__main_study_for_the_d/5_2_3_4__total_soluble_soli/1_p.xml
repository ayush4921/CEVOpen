<p>Lettuce tissue (three biological replicates/treatment/day; 1 g) was grinded/pressed to extract the juice with a domestic blender. Total soluble solids (TSS) content was determined using a digital portable refractometer (Atago, Tokyo, Japan) and results were expressed in percentage (%). Lettuce titratable acidity (TA) was assessed by titration with 0.1 N NaOH as previously reported [
