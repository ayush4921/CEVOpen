<p>Ascorbic acid (AA) is being extensively used in the food industry mainly as a reducing agent in order to prevent undesirable reactions such as enzymatic browning. As with other organic acids (i.e., citric and oxalic acid), AA has been used during processing in order to regulate the microbial load of fresh commodities due to its antioxidant activity as well as its ability to lower the pH of washing water [

 <xref rid="B18-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] reported that AA maintained high phenolic content of fresh-cut lettuce indicating lower phenol oxidation levels due to enzymatic activity and thus lower browning on cut surfaces. In another study, the bright green color of lettuce was maintained with the application of AA [
