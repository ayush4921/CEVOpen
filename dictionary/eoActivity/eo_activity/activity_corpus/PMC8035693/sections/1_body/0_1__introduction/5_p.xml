<p>Chitosan is a naturally occurring polymer delivered from crab shells, and it has been employed to stabilize ingredients in tablets in medicines. Chitosan was the first basic compound for plant protection that was approved by the European Union (Reg. EU 2014/563) due to its low toxicity and when applied to plants its effectiveness results from three mechanisms (film formation, antimicrobial activity, and elicitation of host defense) [

Chitosan has been proven to act as an elicitor of plant defense mechanisms when applied to plant tissues and this forms a protection against pre- and postharvest microbial contamination and spoilage of strawberry fruit as reported by Landi et al. [
