<p>Postharvest weight loss due to moisture loss can cause deterioration and shrinking of leaf tissue [
 <xref rid="B52-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In this study, up to 7.51% weight loss was observed with the application of AA, while chitosan and Chitosan+AA resulted to lower weight losses. Chitosan application to a plant surface (via dipping or spraying) can form an edible coating that can act as a gas barrier (O
 <sub>2</sub> and CO
 <sub>2</sub>) exchange and slow respiration rate [
