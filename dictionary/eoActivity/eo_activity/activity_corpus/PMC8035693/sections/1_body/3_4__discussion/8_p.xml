<p>Antioxidant activity of fresh-cut lettuce increased with the application of EO+AA. It has been shown that AA can react and scavenge radicals and regenerate polyphenols after their oxidation, due to its antioxidant activity [

Furthermore, EOs possess antioxidant activity among others, thus when applied alone or in combination with AA might have resulted to higher phenolic content and antioxidant levels when applied to fresh-cut lettuce. In a previous study, it has been shown that the application of spearmint and lavender EO and their mixture on endive leaves at concentrations as low as 0.001% resulted in lower antioxidant capacity compared to higher concentrations (up to 0.1%) where decreased antioxidants were reported [

 <xref rid="B63-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], wounding of plant tissue can result in increased antioxidant activity in romaine and iceberg lettuce. The application of eugenol, carvacrol, and trans-anethole on cellulose sachets resulted in higher phenolic content as well as antioxidant capacity of fresh-cut iceberg lettuce when exposed to them [

These findings suggest that the applied processing methods might induce defense mechanisms of plant tissue (i.e., increase in antioxidant capacity) that will lead to rapid deterioration and quality losses. This seems to be associated with the applied method, the time of application, the processing product, and the storage conditions, among other parameters.
