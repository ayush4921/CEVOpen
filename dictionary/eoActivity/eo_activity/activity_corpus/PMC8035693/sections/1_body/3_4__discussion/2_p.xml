<p>Chitosan application negatively impacted the aroma and visual quality of fresh-cut lettuce. A non-acceptable aroma and less attractive color was found with the use of chitosan and Chitosan+AA. On the other hand, EO application improved visual quality and acceptable (pleasant) aroma. Similarly, the use of AA maintained the visual quality of fresh-cut lettuce. The application of chitosan-based melatonin bilayer coating on ready-to eat cucumber and broccoli was assessed by Zhao et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and their results supported the benefits observed by combining postharvest preservation means, showing that the applied combinations of melatonin and chitosan maintained the fresh appearance of cucumber. On the same study, fresh-cut broccoli’s bright green color was preserved with the combination of melatonin and chitosan, while the incorporation of 100 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> melatonin caused increased microbial spoilage and chlorophyll losses (yellowing) [

 <xref rid="B13-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] mentioned that when thyme EO applied on fresh-cut lettuce resulted to lower quality product (visual quality, browning, texture, color, and odor) compared to the microencapsulated EO in which no off-odors or severe browning were observed. The application of whey permeate (0.5%, 1.5%, and 3%) on fresh-cut lettuce and carrots did not affect negatively sensory attributes of lettuce, while the highest concentration resulted to higher surface whitening on carrots [
 <xref rid="B11-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Notably, Deza-Durand and Petersen [
 <xref rid="B51-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] reported that even cutting direction (transverse cutting) during processing of fresh-cut lettuce can influence aroma development and respiration rate due to severe tissue damage. These findings suggest that losses of fresh produce quality attributes may arise from processing, applied products (concentration, time of application, and source), and the product itself.
