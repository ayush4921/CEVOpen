<p>Among fresh produce quality attribute, color, and appearance are the most important ones, as they are the first attributes perceived by consumers and can affect their buying decision [
 <xref rid="B58-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The degree of browning in vegetables can be assessed using the 
 <italic>L*</italic>, 
 <italic>a*</italic>, and 
 <italic>b*</italic> chromaticity coordinates. As previously mentioned by Chen et al. [
 <xref rid="B4-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], browning might occur with lower 
 <italic>L*</italic> and higher 
 <italic>a*</italic> and 
 <italic>b*</italic> values. Decreased 
 <italic>L*</italic> values were observed with the use of chitosan and Chitosan+AA, while high 
 <italic>a*</italic>, 
 <italic>b*</italic>, and hue values were also noted suggesting a darker (less green) leaf and the formation of brown pigments. Similarly, CI and chroma values decreased with the application of chitosan and its combinations (EO+Chitosan, Chitosan+AA) and at the same time increased browning index was observed with chitosan. All these results indicated the development and the degradation of lettuce visual quality. The application of AA increased WI of fresh-cut lettuce. Chen et al. [
 <xref rid="B4-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] reported that the application of clove essential oil (0.05%) and eugenol (0.05%) on fresh-cut lettuce maintained its bright green color during 12 days of storage at 4 °C with high 
 <italic>L*</italic> and 
 <italic>b*</italic> values, as well as lower 
 <italic>a*</italic> values. On the same study, lower browning index values were also found after the use of clove EO and eugenol, compared to the 5% ethanol treatment [
 <xref rid="B4-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In another study by Martin-Diana et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], they reported that 3% whey permeate applied on fresh-cut lettuce resulted in high 
 <italic>a*</italic> values compared to lower concentrations; however, 
 <italic>b*</italic> value, hue, and chroma value did not vary. Viacava et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] reported that thyme EO treatment resulted in lower 
 <italic>L*</italic> values, while the microencapsulation of thyme EO did not affect negatively fresh-cut lettuce green color throughout storage (up to 12 days) at 5 °C, suggesting that the combination of film forming compounds can enhance/improve EOs attributes.
