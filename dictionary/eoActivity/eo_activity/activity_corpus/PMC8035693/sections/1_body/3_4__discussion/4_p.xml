<p>Among fresh produce, lettuce consists a commodity with moderate respiration rates and tissue wounding (due to mishandling or processing) might accelerate its respiration rate [
 <xref rid="B51-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Increased respiration rate was observed when the combinations of EO+AA and Chitosan+AA were applied, while chitosan applied alone resulted to lower respiration rates. These findings are in agreement with Romanazzi et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] who suggested that use of chitosan on fruits and vegetables (film formation) can reduce respiration rate acting as a gas exchange barrier, but not as water barrier due its hydrophilic properties. Mechanical damage of leafy vegetables due to cutting, storage, and transport might induce ethylene release, which in combination with increased weight loss can result in fibrosis and lignification on cut surfaces [

 <xref rid="B54-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In this study, the application of marjoram EO decreased ethylene emission, while increased ethylene levels were reported with the application of EO+Chitosan. It has been suggested that a physiological disorder like russet spotting on lettuce can be induced by exposure to ethylene [
 <xref rid="B55-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. This might explain why the application of EO preserved the visual quality of fresh-cut lettuce and at the same time decreased its ethylene emission in our study. Ethylene has been linked with the induced production of plant defense compounds, such as antioxidants and phenols, as well as with the activation of enzymes including chitinase, peroxidase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, and polyphenol oxidase [
 <xref rid="B56-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. It has also been mentioned that the production of ethylene in combination with moisture loss will result in fibrosis and lignification of cut tissue, which will eventually lead to aging, senescence, and quality losses of processed lettuce [
 <xref rid="B4-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Previous indications have shown that lettuce produces very little ethylene and at the same time it is sensitive to the presence of ethylene [
 <xref rid="B3-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Interestingly, Hamanaka and Izumi [
 <xref rid="B57-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] examining the effects of mustard and hop extracts on shredded cabbage and sliced cucumber reported lower respiration rates and ethylene production in both products.
