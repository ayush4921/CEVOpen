<p>Total soluble solids were reduced on the second and fourth day of storage with chitosan application. As reported previously by Moreira et al. [
 <xref rid="B59-foods-10-00575" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], the decrease in TSS might be associated with respiration rate and the consumption of sugars during this process. In the present study little to no relation between respiration rate and TSS of fresh-cut lettuce was observed, as respiration rate slightly increased on the second day, while it significantly decreased on the fourth day of storage with the application of chitosan. Lettuce’s total acidity increased with EO and chlorine application after four days stored at 7 °C, whereas sweetness decreased with the application of chlorine on the fourth and sixth day of storage. According to Zhao et al. [

In a previous study, the application of marjoram EO+AA and marjoram Hydrosol+AA increased shredded carrots TSS compared to the hydrosol when applied alone, while increased TA was reported with the application of AA [

It seems that when natural products are applied on minimal processed fresh produce, they can differently affect quality parameters depending on their properties, the time of application or the product they are applied on, and tailor-made investigations are needed for each commodity.
