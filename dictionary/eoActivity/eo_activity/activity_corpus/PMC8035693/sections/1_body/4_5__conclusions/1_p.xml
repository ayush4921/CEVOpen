<p>The natural-based products used in the current study (marjoram EO, AA, and chitosan) and the outcomes of their application on fresh-cut lettuce provide encouraging evidence for the use of natural compounds in the food industry. Marjoram EO improved aroma and visual quality of lightly processed lettuce, while chitosan used alone negatively affected lettuce color. The combination of EO+AA increased phenolic, ascorbic, and carotenoid contend as well as the antioxidant status of fresh-cut lettuce, thus improving its nutritional value. Interestingly, chitosan, EO, EO+Chitosan, and Chitosan+AA presented antimicrobial activity against TVC and yeast and molds counts of minimally processed lettuce. The findings of this study are promising as the combination of natural products with antioxidant and antimicrobial activities is gaining interest for the maintenance of postharvest quality of fresh commodities and lightly processed vegetables. EO encapsulation could possibly be considered in future studies in order to increase the EO effectiveness during postharvest applications.</p>
