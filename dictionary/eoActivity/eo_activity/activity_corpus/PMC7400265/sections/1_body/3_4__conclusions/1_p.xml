 <italic>C. sativa</italic> is a plant with untapped potential. It has an extensive metabolic profile and its medicinal properties should not be overlooked or overshadowed by its overuse as a recreational drug. Current antibiotic drugs have limited efficacy against MDR bacteria and their usage can be limited due to their toxicity for prolonged treatments; therefore, the discovery of an antimicrobial therapy of plant origin will no doubt be a great advancement in the field of anti-infectives [
 <xref rid="B6-antibiotics-09-00406" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Several cannabinoids have been found to have potent antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive pathogens such as MRSA isolates. Endocannabinoids have also been shown to be effective in eradicating biofilms. Combination therapy with bactericidal agents that possess different modes of action such as polymyxin B have shown synergism and broad-spectrum activity. There is also evidence that other compounds found in 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic> such as terpenes have promising antimicrobial activity, which warrants further investigation. As bacteria are rapidly developing resistance against existing drugs, cannabinoids present a novel and exciting opportunity as a potential new source of antibiotics.
