<p>Recently, Feldman et al. evaluated the endocannabinoids anandamide and arachidonyl serine (

Although they exhibited poor bactericidal activity against planktonic MRSA isolates, they strongly inhibited biofilm formation, with a reduction of metabolic activity of pre-formed biofilms. Furthermore, cell aggregation, hydrophobicity, membrane potential and spreading ability, which are biofilm-associated virulence determinants, were altered. Therefore, these agents have potential as a treatment for recalcitrant MRSA biofilm infections, potentially in combination with existing antibiotics such as ampicillin and gentamicin [
