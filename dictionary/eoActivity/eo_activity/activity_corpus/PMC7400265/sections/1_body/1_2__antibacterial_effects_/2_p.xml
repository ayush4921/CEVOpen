<p>Novak and co-workers evaluated the essential oils of five different cultivars of 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic> against a large panel of Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. The most abundant compounds in each oil sample were α-pinene, myrcene, 
 <italic>trans</italic>-β-ocimene, α-terpinolene, 
 <italic>trans</italic>-caryophyllene and α-humulene. The antimicrobial activity was in general poor, with only modest activity against 
 <italic>Acinetobacter calcoaceticus</italic> and 
 <italic>Brevibacterium linens</italic>. No ∆
 <sup>9</sup>-THC and very low levels of CBD and CBN were detected in all the essential oils, which suggests a role of these compounds in the antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic> [

It was found (via the cup–plate agar diffusion method) that each extract exhibited an antimicrobial effect against Gram-positive pathogens. This is consistent with the study by Van Klingeren et al. [
 <xref rid="B43-antibiotics-09-00406" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], although the cannabinoid content of the plant specimen was not characterized. No significant antifungal activity was observed. Intriguingly, minor activity against Gram-negative bacteria was also reported, albeit a modest effect (note that the petroleum ether extract was inactive against 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B46-antibiotics-09-00406" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Hot water and ethanol leaf extracts have also been shown to possess an inhibitory effect against Gram-negative pathogens [
