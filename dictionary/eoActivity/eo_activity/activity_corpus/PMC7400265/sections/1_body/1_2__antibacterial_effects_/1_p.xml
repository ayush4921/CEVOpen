<p>The first reports detailing the antibacterial activity of cannabinoids date back to the 1950s [

 <xref rid="B42-antibiotics-09-00406" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. These experiments were conducted before the phytochemistry of cannabis was well characterized, which means that the bactericidal effect of 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic> could not be directly attributed to a specific constituent. This was achieved in 1976, where it was found that ∆
 <sup>9</sup>-THC and CBD are bacteriostatic as well as bactericidal against a panel of Gram-positive pathogens (see below) [

 <italic>C. sativa</italic>, such as those derived from petroleum ether, methanol and hot water. Various methods for isolating 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic> extracts have also been applied. Traditional techniques include cold-pressing and solvent extraction, however higher yielding technologies which generate superior products are now emerging [
 <xref rid="B44-antibiotics-09-00406" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Pressurized liquid extraction circumvents the need for filtration, whereas ultrasonic-assisted extraction (UAE) methods use less solvent and have short processing times, with higher yields and equivalent quality. “Green” methods include microwave-assisted extraction and supercritical fluid extraction, however up-scaling is challenging for the latter process [
