<p>Cannabinoids bind to cannabinoid receptors CB
 <sub>1</sub> and CB
 <sub>2</sub> in humans [
 <xref rid="B11-antibiotics-09-00406" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and are distributed throughout the body, including in immune cells. It has been suggested that activation of these receptors could modulate the function of the immune system during infection [

 <italic>C. sativa</italic>, many of which exhibit various pharmacological effects [
 <xref rid="B17-antibiotics-09-00406" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. One of the most studied and main intoxicating cannabinoids is Î”
 <sup>9</sup>-THC, which exerts its effects through partial agonism at the CB
 <sub>1</sub> receptor [

 <xref rid="B19-antibiotics-09-00406" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Another major constituent is CBD, but this compound is not intoxicating [
