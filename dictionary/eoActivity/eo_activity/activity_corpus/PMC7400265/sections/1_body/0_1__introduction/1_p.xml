<p>The discovery of antibiotics is undoubtedly one of the most important scientific achievements in modern medicine and has saved millions of lives since their discovery. However, their misuse has resulted in the emergence of antibacterial resistance (AMR), which is a significant threat to global human health. It is estimated that global deaths could reach 10 million per year by 2050 with a cumulative cost to global economic output of US$100 trillion [
