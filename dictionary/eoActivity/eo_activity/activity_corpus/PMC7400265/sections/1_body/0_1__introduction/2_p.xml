 <italic>Cannabis sativa</italic> is an herbaceous plant that belongs to the family Cannabinaceae [
 <xref rid="B6-antibiotics-09-00406" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It has been used by humans for over 5,000 years for medicinal and recreational uses, firstly in Central and Northeast Asia and subsequently spreading worldwide [
 <xref rid="B7-antibiotics-09-00406" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Cannabis, or marijuana, is undoubtedly one of the most widely used illicit drugs [
 <xref rid="B8-antibiotics-09-00406" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It has a complex chemical composition that includes cannabinoids [
 <xref rid="B9-antibiotics-09-00406" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], which are a group of secondary metabolites, several of which are responsible for the psychotropic effects [

 <xref rid="B11-antibiotics-09-00406" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Metabolic fingerprinting of 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic> unveiled more than 480 compounds, including many terpenes and approximately 180 cannabinoids [
 <xref rid="B12-antibiotics-09-00406" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Their biosynthesis involves the alkylation of olivetolic acid with geranyl diphosphate, which is catalyzed via geranyl transferase [
 <xref rid="B13-antibiotics-09-00406" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This reaction leads to the formation of cannabigerolic acid (CBGA,
