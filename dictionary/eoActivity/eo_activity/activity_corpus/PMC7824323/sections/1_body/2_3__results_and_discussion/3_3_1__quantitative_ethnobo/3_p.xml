<p>The informant consensus factor (F
 <sub>IC</sub>), calculated for the 278 taxa determined at specific and subspecific levels, has a value of 0.97, in a scale where the maximum is 1.00. It is slightly higher than the 0.92 reported for one of the areas here analysed [
 <xref rid="B16-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and it is placed among the highest in different territories where this index has been calculated (Ref [
 <xref rid="B47-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], and references therein). This fact strongly reinforces the above-mentioned reliability requisites assessed in terms of a minimum number of UR. This index was created as “a new approach for identifying potentially effective medicinal plants”, and it can also be used for the same purpose regarding food or other kinds of useful plants. A solid consensus (and not a dispersion of uses with very scarce reports) among informants in the use of a pool of WFP for a purpose (in the present case, food) indicates a trial and error process, and the subsequent agreement of people as concerning some plants with a kind of use rather than random individual uses. This accounts for the robustness and reliability of the useful plants claimed, this being an important factor to identify plants that could be used as food in the future beyond the local level.
