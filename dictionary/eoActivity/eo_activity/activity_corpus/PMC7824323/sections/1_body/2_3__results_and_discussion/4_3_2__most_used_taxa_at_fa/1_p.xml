<p>The five most quoted ones are Lamiaceae (29 taxa, 28.46% of UR), Asteraceae (54, 15.72%), Rosaceae (21, 10.67%), Apiaceae (15, 7.19%) and Lauraceae (one, 4.71%), the first three encompassing more than half of the total UR (

 <xref rid="B75-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] and references therein). In addition, all but the last one are among the five first families in the present work in number of taxa used. The outstanding presence of Lamiaceae in the first place, with more than one quarter of the total UR, is explained by the richness of this family in essential oils, which makes it particularly suitable as spice or condiment. In its turn, the Lauraceae are not a very big family and have only one autochthonous species in the territories studied (
 <italic>Laurus nobilis</italic> L.), but its importance as a condiment makes it highly valued by the informants and present in almost all houses.
