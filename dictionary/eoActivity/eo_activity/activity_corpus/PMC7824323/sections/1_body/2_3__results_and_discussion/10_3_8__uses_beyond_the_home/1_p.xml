<p>Recovering or expanding the use of old foods, in many cases applying the so-called slow food or zero-kilometre cuisine paradigms, is often associated with the concept of ‘
 <italic>terroir</italic>’, closely linked to traditional knowledge on the food products (importantly of plant or fungal origin) [

In an anthropological study of Mallorca’s cuisine (one of the territories concerned in the present paper), Trias [

The identity can be created with cultivated plants of foreign origin, as is the case of one of the leaders of Catalan cuisine, ‘
 <italic>pa amb tomata</italic>’, called in some places ‘
 <italic>pa amb oli</italic>’ (‘bread with tomato’, ‘bread with oil’, prepared by rubbing the bread with tomato and seasoning it with olive oil) [
