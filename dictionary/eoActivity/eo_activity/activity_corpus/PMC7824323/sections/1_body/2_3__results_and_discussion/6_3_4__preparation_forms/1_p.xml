 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00061-f005">Figure 5</xref>. In 
 <xref rid="foods-10-00061-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, 10 kinds of traditional foods elaborated with WFP are presented, with an explanation of their preparation and some examples of plants concerned in each type of food. WFP in the Catalan linguistic area are, in decreasing order, either ingested raw (34.77% of the total UR), used as a condiment (32.71%), ingested cooked (19.22%) or used preserved (3.71%). There is a 7.43% of the UR for which no information of the preparation type is recorded, and a 2.16% of the UR corresponding to the utilisation of a plant as curd. Among these types, the plants that are ingested in high portions are those more representative in feeding terms, even if condiments also represent interesting nuances in this respect.
