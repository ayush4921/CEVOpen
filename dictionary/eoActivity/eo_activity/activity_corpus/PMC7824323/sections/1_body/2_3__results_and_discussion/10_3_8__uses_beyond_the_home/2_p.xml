<p>These nostalgic or identity issues make WFP recoverable. In fact, regarding WFP for salad, some of them were considered deprivation-time food, but this statement can be nuanced and complemented: for instance, talking about 
 <italic>Reichardia picroides</italic>, we recorded this information: “
 <italic>Abans hi havia necessitat, però també agradaven. Hi ha avis que encara les persegueixen</italic>” (‘earlier, there was a need, but they were also liked. There are some elderly people that still look for them’) [
 <xref rid="B97-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. It was not only famine, but taste as well. Indeed, the 85-year-old brother of one of our informants (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-foods-10-00061">Supplementary Material S2</xref>), regularly ate 
 <italic>Portulaca oleracea</italic> salad every summer at his uncles’ house, until he was 12–13 years old. Since then he has never eaten it again. He professed that he did not miss the salad, but he would not mind trying it again, because it was tasty. The popularity of this plant and, at the same time, the lack if its current use, is confirmed by the 67-year-old son of one of our informants (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-foods-10-00061">Supplementary Material S2</xref>) who stated that, when he was 6, 7 or 8 years old, one man used to go regularly to his father’s orchard to harvest 
 <italic>Portulaca oleracea</italic> for familiar consumption, but that he did not eat it since a lot of years. Similarly, the use of some plants has definitely or importantly declined. This is the case of eating 
 <italic>Rumex crispus</italic> L., even directly in the field, or the consumption of 
 <italic>Carlina acanthifolia</italic> All. subsp. 
 <italic>cynara</italic> (Pourr. ex Duby) Arcang. as bread. Also the use has at least almost disappeared of 
 <italic>Althaea officinalis</italic> L. root to give consistency to a broth, replaced by modern culinary densifiers. Conversely, some used arise as new in the area in recent times, such the one of 
 <italic>Papaver</italic> seeds in bread and similar products. Other uses come from old times and are maintained. For instance, collecting some WFP such as 
 <italic>Asparagus acutifolius</italic>, 
 <italic>Crithmum maritimum</italic> and 
 <italic>Rubus ulmifolius</italic> for food purposes continues to be very much alive, because people like to eat them (see also 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot7-foods-10-00061">Section 3.7</xref>). Similarly, sucking 
 <italic>Foeniculum vulgare</italic> inflorescence directly in the field continues alive. For 
 <italic>Crithmum maritimum</italic>, a very common and abundant plant, a protection status has even been established by the government of the Balearic Islands, with personal-use collection allowed, and a permission needed when collecting for commercial purposes [
 <xref rid="B119-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. The different reasons stated above (cultural and identity relevance, not-forgotten good taste, economic value), united to sustainable or zero kilometre or slow food currents, give the opportunity of placing at least some WFP onto the market. We will expound, in a qualitative manner, a few case examples of the area studied.
