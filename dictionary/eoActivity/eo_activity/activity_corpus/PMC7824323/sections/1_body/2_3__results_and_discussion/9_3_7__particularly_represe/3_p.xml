<p>Some WFP are associated with magic or religious believes, and, to some extent, fall within the concept of taboo, which is frequently related to foods [
 <xref rid="B111-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. All 
 <italic>Ruta</italic> species are claimed to be abortive, and this is usually maintained as an old secret, but they are consumed as foods, although with the warning of this possible side effect. A very common tradition in the area studies consists in blessing leafed branches of the above-mentioned 
 <italic>Laurus nobilis</italic> (and, not so commonly 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> and 
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic>) in the Palm Sunday celebration, and the belief that these blessed branches protect the house and its inhabitants is general. It is not at all rare, in addition, to consider that blessed 
 <italic>Laurus</italic> is better than normal one for cooking, expressed with sentences such as “
 <italic>millor si està beneït el dia de Rams</italic>” (‘better if blessed during Palm Sunday’) [
 <xref rid="B100-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. In this case it is not difficult to deduce that, irrespective of the believes, this was a manner of replacing the existences of last year’s 
 <italic>Laurus</italic> leaves for condiment with the new ones, richer in essential oils. In the same magic or religious field, some wild 
 <italic>Allium</italic> species, such as 
 <italic>A. ampeloprasum</italic> L., are called ‘
 <italic>all de bruixa</italic>’ (‘witch’s garlic’) and are not consumed by some people, who associate the plant to witches and toxicity. Associated with another kind of believes, some people has the opinion that consuming nowadays plants collected in the particularly in a direct manner in salads, is dangerous because they are reached by pesticides and other chemical products.
