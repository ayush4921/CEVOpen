<p>The families numerous in taxa and widely distributed, as those here mentioned, are good candidates for leading the ranking of more traditionally known, and used not only for these rather evident reasons, but also for taxonomically-directed processes inducing people to choose useful plants. Saslis-Lagoudakis et al. [
 <xref rid="B87-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] found close phylogenetic relationships between taxa used for the same medicinal purposes in three distant ethnofloras. Concepts such as ethnobotanical convergence [

 <xref rid="B90-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>] or utilitarian equivalence [
 <xref rid="B91-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>] insist, with different nuances, on the relationship between taxonomical affinities and plant use. Most of the examples from the works dealing with this subject refer to traditional medicinal uses, but the idea perfectly applies to food plants, and this idea can even be extended to the genus level. Indeed, Garnatje et al. [
 <xref rid="B89-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>] mention the case of two 
 <italic>Origanum</italic> (Lamiaceae) species used as the condiment of the same kind of food preparation in the Western and Eastern parts of the Mediterranean region, and of food consumption of 
 <italic>Cucurbita pepo</italic> (Cucurbitaceae) flowers in Mesoamerica and South-West Europe. Thus, the territories studied in the present paper, less distant that in the examples quoted, and sharing language and culture, but with important different ecological conditions along the area, make good candidates for processes of taxonomically-oriented plant selection. Chemical composition, close in phylogenetically-related taxa, is claimed as responsible for this phenomenon in medicinal uses ([
 <xref rid="B91-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>] and references therein), and the same can be stated for food utilisation, even more so taking into account the fact that many food plants also have medicinal uses, as we will comment later. Related with chemical composition and also sensitive to phylogenetic closeness, sensorial profiles are relevant for the acceptance of edible plants by people [
