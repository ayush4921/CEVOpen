<p>Wild food plants (WFP) have always been present in the human diet, although in general, and particularly in industrialised areas, they have not always been given the same importance as crops. If Kunkel [
 <xref rid="B1-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] recorded ca. 13,000 species used in human food (a representative figure, even if it has been increased in the most recent literature), human nourishment depends on slightly less than 100 plant species, around 30 producing the vast majority of what we consume, and only three (
 <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L., 
 <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L. and 
 <italic>Zea mays</italic> L.) contributing more than half the diet calories [
