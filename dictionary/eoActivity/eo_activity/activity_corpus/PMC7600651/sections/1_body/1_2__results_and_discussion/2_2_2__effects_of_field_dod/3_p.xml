<p>The main components of oils from both infested and noninfested plants in our study (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01286-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) were α-bisabolol oxide B and α-bisabolol oxide A, followed by α-bisabolene oxide A and chamazulene. The contents of both α-bisabolol oxides and α-bisabolene oxide were higher in infested plants, while noninfested plants were richer in chamazulene. Field dodder infestation also affected the content of other minor oil constituents, reducing the content of (
 <italic>Z</italic>)-en-yn-dicycloether by 84%. Other oil components that were reduced by field dodder infestation were (
 <italic>E</italic>)-en-yn-dicycloether (by 56%), β-selinene (by 54%), and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-β-farnesene (by 49%). In contrast, field dodder infestation increased the content of some oil components besides α-bisabolol oxide A and B and α-bisabolene oxide A, namely guaia-6,10(14)-dien-4β-ol and salvia-4(14)-en-1-on (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01286-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). There was no significant difference only in the content of nerolidol oxide. Furthermore, sesquiterpene compounds accounted for more than 87% of total oil mass of both oils, while oxygenated sesquiterpenes represented 74.11 and 87.24% of noninfested and infested oil mass, respectively, followed by 13.71 and 8.77% of sesquiterpene hydrocarbon, respectively.
