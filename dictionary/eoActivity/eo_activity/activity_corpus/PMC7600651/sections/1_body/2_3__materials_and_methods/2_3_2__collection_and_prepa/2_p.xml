<p>The samples of aromatic plants were collected at the flowering stages as follows: chamomile at the fully flowering stage (65 BBCH, 4th week of May 2017) while field dodder was at the vegetative growing stage; peppermint in the early flowering stage (60–61 BBCH, 3rd week of July 2017) while field dodder was at the flowering stage. The density of peppermint was 4–5 plants per quadrat frame. The density of chamomile was 25–28 plants per quadrat frame. Field dodder was widespread in small oases and aggregated on stems and leaves of peppermint plants, and on stems and leaf petioles of chamomile plants, forming a cover over the aromatic plants. Measurements relating to parasitization percentage of field dodder were carried out in the field plots. Based on visual assessment (percentage of area in trial covered by field dodder), the infestation was moderate, in chamomile plots by 40%, while peppermint plots were infested by 55%.</p>
