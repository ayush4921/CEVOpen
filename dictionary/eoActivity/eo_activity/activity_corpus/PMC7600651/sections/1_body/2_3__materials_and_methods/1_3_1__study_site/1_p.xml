<p>Peppermint (
 <italic>M. piperita</italic>) and chamomile (
 <italic>C. recutita</italic>) plants were grown in fields of the Institute for Medicinal Plant Research “Dr. Josif Pančić”, Pančevo, South Banat, Serbia (44°52′28.4′′ N 20°41′56.2′′ E and 44°52′21.9′′ N 20°41′50.1′′ E, respectively). Peppermint stolons were hand transplanted in the autumn of 2016 in rows, and at 10 cm depth, and 70 cm spacing. The stolons originated from a large-scale peppermint production unit at the Institute. Chamomile was sown at the beginning of October 2016 and at a sowing rate of 2–3 kg/ha. Winter wheat (
 <italic>Triticum vulgare</italic> Vill.) was the pre-crop of both plants and fertilization was applied immediately after deep autumn plowing (November 2016) using compost (25 t/ha). The soil type was chernozem with 2.3% humus, while total nitrogen content was 0.19%. The pH was 6.4 in H
 <sub>2</sub>O, and 5.4 in KCl. Ammonium lactate-extractable (available) P
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>5</sub> and K
 <sub>2</sub>O contents were 36 mg kg
 <sup>−1</sup> and 362 mg kg
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively.
 <monospace> I</monospace>rrigation was also applied three times during the growing season and in the amount of 20 L/ha.
