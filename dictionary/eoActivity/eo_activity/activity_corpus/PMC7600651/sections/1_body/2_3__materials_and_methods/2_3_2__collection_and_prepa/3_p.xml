<p>Plants from each quadrat were cut out just above the ground and samples were brought to the laboratory. In the next step, field dodder plants were manually and completely removed from the stems and leaves of infested plants. Fresh plant material was placed in thin layers in the shade of a draughty place, for the material to dry at the temperature of 20–22 °C for 30 days until reaching humidity levels of 10–12%. After being dried, each individual biomass of infested and noninfested plants was measured, and expressed as means in g/plant. Dry plant material was packed in paper bags and kept in a dry and cool place. After field dodder was separated from the stems and leaves of infested plants, the samples were placed in a drying oven at 60 °C for 72 h until a constant weight was reached. The dry weight of plant biomass was measured and expressed as means in g/m
