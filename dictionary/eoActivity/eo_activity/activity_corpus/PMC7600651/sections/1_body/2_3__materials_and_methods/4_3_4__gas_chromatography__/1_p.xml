<p>Chemical composition of the tested essential oils was analyzed by a Varian CP-3800 gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a split/splitless injector, DB-5MS column (30 m, 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 µm film thickness), and Saturn 2200 mass spectrometer (MS) as a detection device. Injector temperatures were set to 250 °C, and the ion trap and transfer line temperatures were set to 250 and 280 °C, respectively. Helium was used as the carrier gas and its flow rate was 1 mL/min. The column temperature was linearly programmed to rise from 50 to 250 °C at a 4 °C/min rate before holding for 15 min. The mass detector was operated in the electron impact (EI) mode (70 eV; 40–600
