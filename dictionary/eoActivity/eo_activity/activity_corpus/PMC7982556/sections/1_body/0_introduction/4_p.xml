<p>Over the last decades researchers have studied health behaviors change in a wide variety of conditions. Achieving a change in a person’s health behaviors is a difficult and complex process. Consequently, the deviations vary and may have a significant impact on the individual’s health and on the health system. Theories for understanding and enhancing health beliefs (eg, Health Belief Model, Health Promotion Model, and Theory of Reasoned Action) argue that it is relatively easier to achieve onset, than to maintain it in the long-term. The pattern of health behavior change seems to be common, with high recurrence rates varying early after the change. In addition, social factors influence behavior, with an ambiguous impact on both initiating and maintaining health behavior change.
