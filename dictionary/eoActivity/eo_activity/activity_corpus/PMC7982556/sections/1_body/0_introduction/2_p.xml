<p>This condition is postulated to arise from an abundant production of indigenous prostaglandins that result in an irregular pattern of endometrial contractions along with a decrease in the overall endometrial blood supply. Current medical agents against PD have been well established, such as NSAIDs (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs) and COPs (Combined Oral Contraceptives), and act in a way that minimizes the production of prostaglandins. Unfortunately, these drugs come with unpleasant side-effects, such as nausea, vomiting, GI bleeding, acne, and asthma, to name a few, especially when administered for long-term use.
