<p>Kinesio taping along with body awareness have demonstrated favorable outcomes with regards to minimizing pain during menses in women with PD, but the evidence is not enough to support its use widely. Similar, in that cases more studies are necessary to support or not its efficacy.
 <xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> In patients with chronic pain such as PD, studies have shown a distorted body awareness and body sensitivity, thus physiotherapy of any form (kinesio taping, electrotherapy, spinal manipulation, heat therapy, etc.) increases body awareness. The effect size of these interventions, though, is yet to be estimated in future studies.
