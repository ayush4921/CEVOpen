<p>In cases of PD, neuromuscular manipulation and acupressure have been adopted by many patients who consistently report a meaningful improvement in pain intensity and duration.
 <xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Although of low quality, the majority of studies report the effectiveness of this CAM modality in patients suffering from PD.
 <xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Many sites have been proposed, while auricular acupressure gained much popularity due to the simplicity of self-therapy.
 <xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Acupressure by trained personneldemonstrates higher rates of efficacy among studies,

 <xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> but self-administered acupressure remains a risk-free and efficient CAM modality in patients with dysmenorrhea.

 <xref rid="cit0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> The effect of acupressure has also been proven in cases of obesity, smoking cessation, acne, and emotional stability, but the exact mechanism of action remains unclear.
 <xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> In cases of PD though, patients who received acupressure were found to have increased uterine blood flow that potentially minimized the pain and discomfort experienced during menses.
 <xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Many patients adopt manipulative therapy as an adjunct therapeutic tool in the management of PD.
 <xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> A recent RCT that investigates the effect of acupressure in PD concluded that manipulating menstrual pain zones during 10â€“15 sessions provided pain relief for patients with PD along with high rates of satisfaction.
 <xref rid="cit0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> The exact therapeutic duration of each manipulation though needs to be further explored, as international literature fails to present long-term reduction of painful symptoms for these patients.
