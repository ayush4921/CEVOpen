<p>As reviewed here, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> susceptibility assays have been developed for the most common causative agents of black-grain eumycetoma. These assays have been used to establish if causative agents are inhibited in growth by various antifungal agents but not for clinical decision making. For drug discovery, the assay proved useful in determining which compounds were able to prevent hyphal growth and had a direct effect on the fungal cell. A clear correlation between 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> inhibition in terms of IC50 or MIC50 and therapeutic efficacy in terms of 
 <italic>G. mellonella</italic> larval survival was not found. This indicates that for drug discovery, other 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> models are needed to predict the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy of a drug. These models should mimic certain properties of the mycetoma grain. As already seen, adding 
 <italic>M. mycetomatis</italic> melanin to culture medium influenced the MICs obtained for ketoconazole and itraconazole and the formation of biofilms in 
 <italic>E. dermatitidis</italic> also influenced the MICs for the azoles. Therefore, models mimicking various features of the mycetoma grain might overcome these shortcomings.
