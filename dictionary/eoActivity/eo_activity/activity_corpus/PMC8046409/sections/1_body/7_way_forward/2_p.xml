<p>Before the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> susceptibility assays can be used for clinical decision making, they need to be assessed to determine if a correlation between MIC and clinical outcome exists. For that, large data sets are needed. In the current ongoing proof-of-concept superiority trial of fosravuconazole versus itraconazole for eumycetoma caused by 
 <italic>M. mycetomatis</italic> in Sudan (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03086226), 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> susceptibility will be linked to clinical outcome and epidemiological cut-off values and break points will be determined for the early lesions included in the trial.

 </xref> However, more extensive data are needed to verify if these break points might also be valid in extensive lesions or when other body sites are infected. Furthermore, the current 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> susceptibility tests use sonication to prepare a hyphal inoculum and viability dyes to assess fungal growth. These might be too labour intensive and expensive in clinical settings. When a clinical correlation is established, the next step would be to assess in which ways 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> susceptibility assays could be made more user friendly for clinical use.
