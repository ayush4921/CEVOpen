<p>There are several viability dyes that have been used for endpoint reading in

 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">

 </xref> (Table 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The most common dyes are resazurin and tetrazolium salts (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>). Of these, resazurin is the oldest in use and also the cheapest. Furthermore, its derivative, alamarBlue, is also used in the commercial CLSI-based antifungal susceptibility assay YeastOne.

 </xref> Resazurin is non-fluorescent and deep blue coloured and will be metabolically reduced by 1,4-dihydronicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) in viable cells to the fluorescent pink-coloured resorufin
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">

 </xref> It can be dissolved directly in culture media and is often added at the beginning of an antifungal susceptibility assay and incubated during the assay.
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">

 </xref> To measure the metabolic activity, resazurin and resorufin are measured fluorometrically (λ
 <sub>ex</sub> 579 nm, λ
 <sub>em</sub> 584 nm) or colourimetrically (resazurin, 605 nm; resorufin, 573 nm).
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">

 </xref> There is no need for cell lysis prior to spectrophotometric measurement, as both resazurin and resorufin diffuse freely through the fungal cell membrane.
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">

 </xref> Although resazurin is relative cheap, it has only limited linear range that is highly dependent on the temperature, pH and initial resazurin concentration.

 </xref> Due to the prolonged incubation and the secretion of pyomelanin by 
 <italic>M. mycetomatis</italic>, growth was observed as brown instead of pink (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>A).

 </xref> The brown pigmentation did not influence the visual endpoint reading of the MIC (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>A), however, it influenced the wavelength at which reliable readings could be obtained. Therefore, for 
 <italic>M. mycetomatis</italic>, absorbance was measured at 620 nm when alamarBlue was used
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>18</sup>
 </xref> and at 600 nm when resazurin was used.
