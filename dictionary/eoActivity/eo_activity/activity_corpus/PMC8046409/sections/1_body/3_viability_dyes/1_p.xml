<p>Since both the CLSI and EUCAST reference methods use visual endpoint reading, this becomes more complicated when the starting inoculum is already turbid.

 </xref> In the case of a hyphal suspension, this is often the case. In such cases, viability dyes detecting metabolic activity can be used as an alternative method for endpoint reading even though growth and metabolic activity are not necessarily equivalent. This is because any drug that has a direct influence on the metabolic rate could have an effect on the reduction of viability dyes even if the biomass remains the same.
