<p>For fungal infections caused by

 <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> and 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> species, antifungal susceptibility assays are routinely used to support clinicians in improving patient management and predicting treatment response.

 </xref> For 
 <italic>Candida</italic>, this correlation is often called the ‘90–60’ rule, which means that infections due to susceptible 
 <italic>Candida</italic> strains respond to appropriate antifungal therapy in approximately 90% of cases, whereas infections due to resistant strains respond in approximately 60% of cases.

 <italic>in vitro</italic> susceptibility assays are used to guide patient management. For mycetoma, routine antifungal susceptibility assays are not performed and no correlation between the MIC and clinical outcome has been established to date. However, efforts are under way to determine if antifungal susceptibility assays can be of value in mycetoma management. Here I will review the development and use of the current antifungal susceptibility assays for eumycetoma causative agents.
