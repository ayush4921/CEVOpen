<p>Eumycetoma is treated with a combination of antifungal agents and surgery. The treatment chosen is not dependent on the species identification. To treat eumycetoma, most commonly the regimen from the Mycetoma Research Centre in Khartoum, Sudan is used. In this regimen, the patient is treated with 200–400 mg itraconazole daily for 6 months to create a good fibrous capsule around the lesion, followed by wide local excision. After surgery the patient continues on 200–400 mg itraconazole daily until cure is achieved.

 </xref> In regions where itraconazole is not widely available, terbinafine is used as an alternative. In that case, eumycetoma is treated with 500 mg terbinafine twice daily and then surgery.
