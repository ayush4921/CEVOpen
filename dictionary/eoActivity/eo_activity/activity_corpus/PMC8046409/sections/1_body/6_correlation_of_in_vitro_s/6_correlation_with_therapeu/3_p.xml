<p>Currently there are no linked data between MICs obtained for 
 <italic>M. mycetomatis</italic> and clinical outcome. Furthermore, since surgery is always a component of mycetoma treatment, direct comparison between MICs and outcomes might be complicated. However, there are a few studies in which different series of patients were treated with either ketoconazole,
