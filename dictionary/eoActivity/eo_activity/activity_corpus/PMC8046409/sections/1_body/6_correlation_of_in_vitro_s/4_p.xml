<p>Characteristic of the 
 <italic>M. mycetomatis</italic> grain is the presence of melanin and an extracellular matrix (cement material) that surrounds the hyphae in the grain. 
 <italic>M. mycetomatis</italic> 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene–melanin did interfere with susceptibility to antifungal agents.

 </xref> A four to five twofold dilution step increase in MIC was obtained when 250 µg/ml 
 <italic>M. mycetomatis</italic> melanin was added in the Sensititre YeastOne 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> susceptibility assay. This increase in MIC was only observed for ketoconazole and itraconazole. This was not found for voriconazole, fluconazole or amphotericin B.
 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>59</sup>
 </xref> For ketoconazole and itraconazole, this increase in MIC was likely due to binding of the drug to melanin. This binding most likely prevented the drug from reaching its intracellular target.

 </xref> Along with melanin, the extracellular matrix can protect against antifungal agents. This matrix consists of proteins, chitin and polysaccharides,

 </xref> Some of the compounds inside the fungal extracellular matrix, such as β-1,3-D-glucan and extracellular DNA, can physically bind antifungal agents and thereby prevent the drugs from reaching the intended target at the surface or within the fungal cell.

  <sup>64</sup>
 </xref> Along with the physical barrier, the upregulation of efflux pumps and the presence of metabolically dormant cells have been implicated in the increased resistance.

 </xref> Biofilms have been studied for the rare mycetoma causative agent 
 <italic>Exophiala dermatitidis in vitro</italic>. For 
 <italic>E. dermatitidis</italic> it was demonstrated that despite the use of susceptible planktonic cells in generating biofilms, the biofilm itself was completely resistant to itraconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole.

 </xref> The only antifungal agent tested that did have some activity against the 
 <italic>E. dermatitidis</italic> biofilm was amphotericin B. A 50% reduction in fungal metabolic activity was obtained when 
 <italic>E. dermatitidis</italic> was incubated with 1–2 µg/ml amphotericin B, a concentration similar to the MIC obtained with planktonic cells.
