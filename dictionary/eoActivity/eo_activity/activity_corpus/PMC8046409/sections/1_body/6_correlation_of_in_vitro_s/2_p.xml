 </xref> When 
 <italic>G. mellonella</italic> larvae were infected with 4 mg/larvae and treated with 5.7 mg/kg of either ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole or posaconazole, no enhanced larval survival was noted compared with the phosphate-buffered saline–treated control. Grains were still present after 10 days.
