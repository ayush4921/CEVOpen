<p>Besides looking at correlations between 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> activity of standard antifungal agents and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy, the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> susceptibility assays were also used to discover novel drugs for mycetoma. For this, 1200 compounds were screened and 14 were tested in the 
 <italic>G. mellonella</italic> grain model for therapeutic efficacy at a fixed concentration of 20 µM/larvae. The compounds evaluated 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> were bitertanol, difenconazole, azoxystrobin, trifloxystrobin, MMV006357, MMV675968, MMV687807, MMV022478, MMV689244 (EPL-BS1246), EPL-BS0178, EPL-BS0495, EPL-BS0800 and EPL-BS1025. From these compounds, only bitertanol, MMV006357, MMV675968, MMV022478, EPL-BS0178, EPL-BS0495 and EPL-BS1025 significantly enhanced larval survival.

 </xref> As can be seen in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, no correlation between either IC50 or MIC50 and larval survival was found. This indicated that the currently used 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> susceptibility assay can determine which compounds are able to inhibit fungal growth but the inhibiting concentration is not predictive for 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> activity using fixed concentrations. For the fenarimol compounds, the logD value at pH 7.4 was more indicative than the IC50 or MIC50.
