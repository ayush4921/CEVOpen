 <italic>M. mycetomatis</italic>. This has not been assessed for any of the other causative agents. In each of these studies, only a single 
 <italic>M. mycetomatis</italic> isolate was investigated. This makes it impossible to correlate the MIC of a drug with the therapeutic efficacy in an animal model.
