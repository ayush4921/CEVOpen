<p>Based on the observations in both the mouse model as well as in the 
 <italic>G. mellonella</italic> model, it can be concluded that despite the higher MIC50s found for amphotericin B and terbinafine 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> they were superior to the azoles at the concentrations given.

 </xref> One of the reasons for this is that in the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> susceptibility assays, hyphae are exposed to antifungal agents, while 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> hyphae are embedded in the mycetoma grain, which could offer the fungus protection against environmental stress. Since grains cannot be formed 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, direct comparison between grains and hyphae in terms of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> susceptibility testing can only be done when using either grains directly from patients or grains formed in animal models. Currently only one study with a direct comparison has been performed.

 </xref> compared the MIC of amphotericin B obtained with 1 mg 
 <italic>M. mycetomatis</italic> hyphae with the MIC obtained from seven grains obtained from experimentally 
 <italic>M. mycetomatis</italic>–infected mice. The MIC obtained with 
 <italic>M. mycetomatis</italic> hyphae was 1 µg/ml for amphotericin B, while no MIC was obtained with 
 <italic>M. mycetomatis</italic> grains using concentrations up to 100 µg/ml. This demonstrated that the grain offered protection against amphotericin B. This was confirmed by an experiment in which five 
 <italic>M. mycetomatis</italic> grains were immersed in 50 µg/ml amphotericin B for 24 h. Three of five grains were still viable even after such long exposures.
