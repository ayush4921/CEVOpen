<p>The XTT-based antifungal susceptibility assay was also used to determine the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> activity of the antiseptic solutions 1% povidone iodine, 0.5% taurolidine Ringer’s solution, 0.02% chlorhexidine and 1% hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) against 10 
 <italic>M. mycetomatis</italic> isolates. MICs ranged from 1:100 to &gt;1:10 for 1% povidone iodine, 1:100 to 1:10 for 0.5% taurolidine Ringer’s solution, 1:200 to &gt;1:10 for 0.02% chlorhexidine and 1:200 to 1:20 for 1% H

 </xref> However, the killing time of the solutions was different. The 1% povidone iodine was able to kill 
 <italic>M. mycetomatis</italic> within 5 min, while 2 h was needed when 0.02% chlorhexidine or 1% H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> was used. A killing time of &gt;6 h was needed when 0.5% taurolidine Ringer’s solution was used.

 </xref> Since the killing time for antiseptic solutions is more important than the killing concentration, probably the most active antiseptic solution against 
 <italic>M. mycetomatis</italic> is 1% povidone iodine.
