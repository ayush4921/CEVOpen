<p>Of the mycetoma causative agents belonging to the order Pleosporales, low MICs are also found for amphotericin B and the azoles and higher concentrations for 5-flucytosine and caspofungin (Table 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). However, the MICs found for the azoles are in general three to four two-fold dilution steps higher than those found for 
 <italic>M. mycetomatis.</italic> In contrast, although 
 <italic>Madurella</italic> sp. are not inhibited at all by 5-flucytosine, growth inhibition was noted for the Pleosporales causative agents (Table 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).
