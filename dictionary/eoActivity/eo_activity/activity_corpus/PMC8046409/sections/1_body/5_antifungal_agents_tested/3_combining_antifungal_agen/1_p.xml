<p>As demonstrated in the previous paragraph, 
 <italic>M. mycetomatis</italic> is inhibited by antifungal agents belonging to the polyenes, azoles, allylamines and orotomides. The next question was if enhanced growth inhibition occurs when itraconazole is combined with an antifungal agent belonging to a different class of antifungal agents. Therefore the combinations ketoconazole–terbinafine, itraconazole–terbinafine and itraconazole–olorofim have been tested. All combinations appeared to be indifferent according to the calculated Fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) and interaction ratio's (IR) (Table

 </xref> This indifference was confirmed 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> in 
 <italic>Galleria mellonella</italic> larvae. Treatment with a combination of itraconazole and terbinafine did not enhance larval survival compared with treatment with itraconazole or terbinafine alone.

 </xref> Combining amphotericin B with either itraconazole or terbinafine was antagonistic in the 
 <italic>in vivo G. mellonella</italic> grain model.
