 </xref> From the 1200 compounds screened, 287 inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>M. mycetomatis</italic> at a concentration of 100 µM and 29 had a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) &lt;5 µM. These included the azoles ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, ravuconazole, isavuconazonium (isovuconazole), eberconazole, luliconazole, miconazole, bitertanol and difenoconazole; the benzimidazoles fenbendazole and carbendazim; and the strobilurins azoxystrobin and trifloxystrobin. Two of the potent hits obtained from these screenings were olorofim
