<p>For antifungal susceptibility testing, two international reference methods have been developed. These are the reference method of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)

 </xref> and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST).

 </xref> These methods are quite similar, as they are both performed in 96-well plates, use Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 culture medium and spores or conidia as starting points and have identical incubation temperatures and times.

 </xref> In both assays, growth is read visually by the naked eye. Between these two different methods, only minor differences are found. These include the concentration of glucose within the RPMI medium (0.2% in CLSI and 2% in EUCAST), the type of microdilution plate used (U-shaped in CLSI and flat bottom in EUCAST) and the fungal inoculum used (0.4×10
 <sup>4</sup>–5×10
 <sup>4</sup> cfu/ml in CLSI and 1×10
 <sup>5</sup>–2.5×10
 <sup>5</sup> cfu/ml in EUCAST).
