  <p>Correlation between 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> susceptibility data and percentage survival in 
   <italic>M. mycetomatis–</italic>infected 
   <italic>G. mellonella</italic> larvae. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Correlation between IC50 (µM) and larval survival (%) of compounds tested for the pandemic and stasis boxes. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Correlation between MIC50 of compounds from the pandemic and stasis boxes (blue) or commonly used antifungal agents (red) and larval survival (%). The MIC50s for the compounds present in the pandemic and stasis box were determined in µM, while the MIC50s of the antifungal agents were determined in µg/ml.
