   <bold>A</bold>) The visual appearance of the wells and the calculated growth percentages obtained with alamarBlue, a resazurin derivative. The well on the far left indicates the growth control, followed by various concentrations of itraconazole. The isolates used produced pyomelanin, therefore a brown colour is seen. The well on the far left is the negative control, which is blue in the case of amphotericin B or light purple in the case of itraconazole. Different shades of brown or pink indicate different percentages of growth. These differences are also noted when the growth is calculated relative to the growth and negative controls. Typically growth percentages range from 0 to 100%. The MIC is considered the first well, which has a growth percentage &lt;20%. (
   <bold>B</bold>) The visual appearance of the wells and the calculated growth percentages obtained with XTT. The well on the far left indicates the growth control. A dark orange colour can be seen. The well on the far right is the negative control, in which a light orange colour is seen. Between the negative controls, different concentrations of amphotericin B or itraconazole are seen. Different shades of orange indicate different percentages of growth. Typically growth percentages range from 0 to 100%. The MIC is considered the first well, which has a growth percentage &lt;20%.
