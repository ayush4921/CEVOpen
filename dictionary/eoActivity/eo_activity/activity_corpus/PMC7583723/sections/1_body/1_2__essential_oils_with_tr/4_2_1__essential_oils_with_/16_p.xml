<p>Recently, the inhibitory properties and cellular effects of the essential oils of 
 <italic>L. alba</italic> and their main bioactive terpenes and the synergy between them were shown against the strains of 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic>. The 
 <italic>L. alba</italic> OEs had significant differences in their chemical composition and trypanocidal performance (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0001). Citral chemotype oils showed greater trypanocidal activity than carvone essential oils, with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC
 <sub>50</sub> values) of 14 ± 1.5, 22 ± 1.4 and 74 ± 4.4 μg/mL in epimastigotes, trypomastigotes and amastigotes, respectively [
