<p>Baldissera et al. (2017) [
 <xref rid="B65-molecules-25-04568" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] verified the trypanocidal activity in vitro of EOs of 
 <italic>Lippia alba</italic> and 
 <italic>Lippia origanoides</italic> against 
 <italic>T. evansi</italic> trypomastigotes. The lower concentration of EOs (0.5%) eliminated the parasites after 6 h of interaction. Experiments in vivo with mice also were performed. The animals were treated with EOs at a dose of 1.5 mL/kg for five days and, despite not showing curative efficacy, the treated mice with EO of 
 <italic>L. origanoides</italic> showed increase in longevity when compared to the control group.
