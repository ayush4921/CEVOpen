<p>The 
 <italic>Cinnamomum verum</italic> J. Presl. essential oil presented in vitro anti-
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> activity at concentrations of 24.13, 20.0 and 5.05 μg/mL and was dissolved in DMSO [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-04568" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Inhibitory activity was assessed by Thiazolyl Blue Tetrazolium Bromide (MTT) colorimetric assay [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-04568" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-04568" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Analysis of the essential oils of the species revealed that (
 <italic>E</italic>)-cinnamaldehyde and eugenol were the principal constituents, suggesting that its trypanocidal activity may be related to these components. The study also pointed out that (
 <italic>E</italic>)-cinnamaldehyde was not effective against 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> epimastigotes at low concentrations of up to 300 μM.
