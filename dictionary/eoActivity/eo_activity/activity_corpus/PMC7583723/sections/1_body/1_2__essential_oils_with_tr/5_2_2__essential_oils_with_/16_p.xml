<p>Hoet et al. (2006) [
 <xref rid="B59-molecules-25-04568" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] analyzed the essential oil from the leaves of 
 <italic>Strychnos spinosa</italic> (Loganiaceae). Twenty-two compounds were identified in the oil; the main constituents were palmitic acid (34.3%) and linalool (16.0%). The in vitro activity of the essential oil and 15 components against 
 <italic>T. brucei brucei</italic> and mammalian cells were analyzed. The essential oil was active against the parasite without a high selectivity [IC
 <sub>50</sub> in 
 <italic>T. b. brucei</italic> = 13.5 µg/mL, SI = 4.4]. (
 <italic>E</italic>)-Nerolidol and linalool showed a more potent and selective effect on trypanosomes [IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.7 and 2.5 µg/mL (7.6 and 16.3 µM).
