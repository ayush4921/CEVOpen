<p>The essential oil from the species 
 <italic>Keetia leucantha</italic> (K. Krause) Bridson [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-25-04568" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] presented in vitro anti-
 <italic>T. brucei</italic> activity at a concentration of 20.9 µg/mL. Analysis of the essential oil suggested α-ionone, β-ionone, and ursolic acid were the compounds that presented the best inhibitory activity against 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic>, although analysis of the oil revealed that the principal constituents of the oil were 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexadecanoic acid and phytol, which presented IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of &gt;100 and 19.1 µg/mL, respectively.
