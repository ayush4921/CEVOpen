<p>As reported by Santoro et al. (2007) [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-04568" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], the in vitro trypanocidal activity of the species 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> L. must be associated with the presence of thymol (80.4%). The author does not rule out the possibility that other components may be more active against 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> than thymol. As a result of this study, IC
 <sub>50</sub>/24 h values equal to 77 μg/mL for epimastigotes and 38 μg/mL for trypomastigotes were found; each essential oil was dissolved in DMSO for the trypanocidal activity assays.
