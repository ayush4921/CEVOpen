<p>Gutierrez et al. (2019) [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-25-04568" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] studied the activity of the OE of 
 <italic>Phania matricarioides</italic> (Spreng.) Griseb. against 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> trypomastigotes. The main compounds identified in the EO were lavandulyl acetate and thymyl isobutyrate. The OE was bioactive against 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.2 Âµg/mL and SI = 13).
