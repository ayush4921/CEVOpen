<p>Baldissera et al. (2013) [
 <xref rid="B64-molecules-25-04568" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] investigated the in vitro activity of the essential oils of andiroba (
 <italic>Carapa guaianensis</italic>) and aroeira (
 <italic>Schinus molle</italic>) against 
 <italic>T. evansi</italic> trypanosomes using conventional (at concentrations of 0.5%, 1.0%, and 2.0%) and nanoemulsion forms (at concentrations of 0.5% and 1.0%). The tests were performed in duplicate and the numbers of parasites evaluated after 1, 3 and 6 h. The trypanocidal activity of essential oils was dose-dependent and, after 6 h of experiment, no living trypanosomes were observed. For the nanoemulsion oils, the activity was dose-dependent after 1 h of interaction, but after 3 h no alive parasites were observed.
