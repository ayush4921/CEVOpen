 <xref rid="B14-molecules-25-04568" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] suggested that the trypanocidal activity of these essential oils may be associated with oxygenated terpenes found in small quantities in both plant species. Trypanocidal activity of oxygenated terpenes had already been reported in a previous study [
