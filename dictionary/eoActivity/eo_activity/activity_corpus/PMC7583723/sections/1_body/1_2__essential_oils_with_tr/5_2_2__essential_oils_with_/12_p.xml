 <italic>Smyrnium olusatrum</italic> L. (Apiaceae) is characterized by oxygenated sesquiterpenes containing a furan ring. In the work of Petrelli et al. 2017 [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-25-04568" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], the 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic> inhibitory activities of the essential oils obtained from different organs and of the main oxygenated sesquiterpenes, such as isofuranediene, germacrone and β-acetoxifuranoeudesm-4-ene, were explored. All oils inhibited the growth of the parasite, showing IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 1.9–4.0 µg/mL; isofuranediene exhibited significant and selective inhibitory activity against 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.6 μg/mL, SI = 30), with β-acetoxifuranoeudesm-4-ene giving a moderate potentiating effect.
