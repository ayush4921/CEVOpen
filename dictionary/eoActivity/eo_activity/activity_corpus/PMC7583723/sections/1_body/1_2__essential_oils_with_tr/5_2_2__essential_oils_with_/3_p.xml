<p>The study presented by Nibret and Wink (2010) [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-25-04568" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] was compared to that of Costa et al. (2013) [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-04568" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] where the analysis of the essential oil of 
 <italic>Cinnamomum verum</italic> J. Presl was made against the 
 <italic>T cruzi</italic> species. (
 <italic>E</italic>)-cinnamaldehyde was effective against 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic> trypomastigotes in low concentrations (2.93 Î¼g/mL). The trypanocidal activities of the essential oils of 
 <italic>Hagenia abyssinica</italic> (Bruce) J.F. Gmel. (Rosaceae), 
 <italic>Leonotis ocymifolia</italic> (Burm. F.) Iwarsson var. (Lamiaceae) and 
 <italic>Moringa stenopetala</italic> (Baker f.) Cufod. (Moringaceae), with concentrations of 42.30 mg/mL, 15.41 mg/mL and 5.03 mg/mL, respectively, were investigated. The analysis of the chemical composition of the oils identified ledol in 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic>, caryophyllene oxide in 
 <italic>L. ocymifolia,</italic> and benzyl isothiocyanate and isobutyl isothiocyanate in 
 <italic>M. stenopetala</italic>. The cytotoxic and trypanocidal activities of these oils can be attributed to these components, and their biological activity can also be increased by the presence of other compounds acting in an additive or synergistic way.
