 <xref rid="B62-molecules-25-04568" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], the essential oil from the species 
 <italic>Achyrocline satureioides</italic> (Lam.) DC. (Macela) presented bioactivity in vivo against 
 <italic>T. evansi</italic> at a dose of 1.5 mL/kg after oral administration for five consecutive days. For hematological analysis, blood samples were collected on the fifth day. The chemical compounds with higher proportions in the essential oil were the terpenes α-pinene and β-caryophyllene, and the trypanocidal activity was attributed to these compounds.
