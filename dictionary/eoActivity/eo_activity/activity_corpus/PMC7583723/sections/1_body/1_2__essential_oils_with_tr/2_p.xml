<p>The trypanocidal models/methods employed (Tables 1â€“3) for the in vitro and in vivo testing of trypanocidal activity of essential oils were as follows: in vitro testing with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) microdilution was used for 95.1% of the oils, dissolution in 5% ethanol was used for 2.4% of the oils, and dissolution in 5% acetone was used for 2.4% of the essential oils; evaluation with colorimetric test MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) was used for 46.7% of the oils. The resazurin test that evaluates proliferation of trypanosomes in an in vivo test was used for 6.7% of the studies.</p>
