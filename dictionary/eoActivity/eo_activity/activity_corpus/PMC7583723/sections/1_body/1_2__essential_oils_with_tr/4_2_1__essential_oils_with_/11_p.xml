<p>Costa et al. (2013) [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-04568" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] conducted studies with the essential oils of the species 
 <italic>Annona pickelii</italic> (Diels) H. Rainer and 
 <italic>Annona salzmannii</italic> A. DC., which presented in vitro anti-
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> activity of 28.7 and 89.7 µg/mL, respectively. In 2012, Costa et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-04568" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] conducted a study on 
 <italic>Annona vepretorum</italic> Mart., which presented trypanocidal activity against 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> at a concentration of 40.9 µg/mL. Analysis of the essential oils of these species revealed that sesquiterpenes are the main constituents; for 
 <italic>Annona pickelii,</italic> the highest percentages were for bicyclogermacrene and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene; for 
 <italic>A. salzmannii,</italic> the compounds with the highest percentages were (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene, bicyclogermacrene, δ-cadinene, α-copaene and germacrene D; and for 
 <italic>Annona vepretorum,</italic> the compounds with the highest percentages were bicyclogermacrene and spathulenol. In general, the trypanocidal activities were attributed to the high concentrations of bicyclogermacrene.
