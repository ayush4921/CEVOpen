<p>The data presented demonstrate the importance of essential oils as natural products to be investigated for the development of new therapeutic options in the face of neglected diseases, especially trypanosomiasis. It is necessary to evaluate the main chemical components of these oils in experimental models in vitro and in vivo, in addition to researching their mechanism of trypanocidal action. In addition, the therapeutic safety of these products must be evaluated through toxicological studies. The abundance of essential oils in several tropical countries and low production costs make them interesting compounds to be researched as new pharmacological tools for use in the treatment of neglected diseases. The study will also support the discovery of new essential oils and/or chemical constituents, as well as analogous compounds with trypanocidal activity.</p>
