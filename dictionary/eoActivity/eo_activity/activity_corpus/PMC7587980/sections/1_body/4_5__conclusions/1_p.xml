<p>Tangerine essential oil has a stimulation effect on the human brain, which is observed by the reduction of slow and fast alpha wave powers and the increase of low beta and mid beta wave powers. Interestingly, alpha and beta wave power were clearly decreased during inhalation of threshold concentration of the oil, indicating the sedative effect of tangerine oil on this level. These results reveal the different effects of the different concentrations of tangerine oil, which may contribute to the concentration-dependent effect of essential oil inhalation. Moreover, the reduction of sleep onset latency was further confirmed by the sedative effect of threshold-level tangerine oil.</p>
