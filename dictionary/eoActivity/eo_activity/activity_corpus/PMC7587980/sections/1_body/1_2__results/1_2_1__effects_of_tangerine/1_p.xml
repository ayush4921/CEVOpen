<p>Tangerine essential oil was analyzed using GC-MS technique. The GC-MS analysis of the tangerine oil identified the compounds presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04865-f001">Figure 1</xref>. The major compounds of this tangerine oil are d-Limonene (74.47%) and γ-Terpinene (10.86%). Other compounds were α-Phellandrene, Camphene, β-Pinene, Sabinene, 3-Carene, β-Myrcene, 2,4,6-Octatriene, 3,4-dimethyl-, o-Cymene, Octanal, Nonanal, and linalool (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04865-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Brain wave alteration was analyzed for each representative frequency of each frequency, slow alpha wave (9 Hz), fast alpha wave (12 Hz), low beta wave (14 Hz), mid beta wave (17 Hz), and high beta wave (25 Hz). Power spectral analysis technique was used to clearly identify the differences. All of electrodes were analyzed to investigate overall activity of the brain. Volunteers were the same age and had enough sleeping hours during the night before the day of the experiment. Mixed gender, male, and female data were divided to see the gender difference. Tangerine essential oil inhalation reduced slow and fast alpha wave powers. Low and mid beta wave power increased during oil inhalation. High beta wave power showed no difference among groups. For female subjects, the oil inhalation reduced slow alpha wave power but the oil increased low and mid beta wave powers. The oil inhalation showed slight effects in the male subjects, which only reduced fast alpha wave power (

 <xref rid="molecules-25-04865-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Tangerine essential oil inhalation showed gender difference. We did not directly analyze gender difference between female and male, however, female responses to the oil can be obviously observed in the frequency of alpha and beta wave powers.
