<p>Moreover, dry aqueous extracts of Rhus aromatica, made from the plantâ€™s roots and bark, were studied by Reichling et al.

 </sup> for antiherpetic activity against HSV-1 (strain KOS) and HSV-2 (strain HG52). R. aromatica did not significantly decrease infection in cells exposed to virions prior to treatment with the plant extract, however, the extract was shown to significantly decrease plaque formation when incubated with virions pre-infection (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.0005% and SI = 5400 for HSV-1; IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.0043% and SI = 628 for HSV-2). HSV-1 was more susceptible to the extract, and when virions were incubated with the extract at a non-cytotoxic dose of 0.0025% for 1 minute, HSV-1 plaques were reduced by 90%.
