 </sup> It was observed that the extract was able to inhibit HSV-1 in a dose-dependent manner, but was not as effective as treatment with acyclovir. The EC
 <sub>50</sub> and SI values, respectively, were determined to be 0.34 μg/ml and 14.9 for E. spinidens and 0.028 μg/ml and &gt;178.6 for acyclovir. Time-of-addition experiments revealed that application of the extract at a concentration of 5 mg/ml was most effective at inhibiting the virus within the first 2 hours of its life cycle, demonstrating a total of 70% inhibition. The authors conclude that the extract of E. spinidens may inhibit HSV-1 adsorption and early stages of viral replication.
