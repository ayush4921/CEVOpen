 </sup> The extractâ€™s antiviral effects were compared to that of an extract of Ribes nigrum, called Kurokarin. The S. nigra extract was shown to have a SI of 2.14 against acyclovir-resistant HSV-1, but SI &lt;1 against the other 2 strains. The SI values of Kurokarin were determined to be 1.19 against wild-type HSV-1, 2.19 against acyclovir-resistant HSV-1, and 1.72 against HSV-2. Both extracts offered more potent viral inhibition against acyclovir-resistant HSV-1 compared to the wild type HSV-1.
