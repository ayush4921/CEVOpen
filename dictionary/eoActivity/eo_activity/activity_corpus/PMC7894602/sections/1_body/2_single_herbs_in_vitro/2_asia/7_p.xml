 </sup> Assays were performed in the presence of UV-A light, visible light, and darkness to allow for assessment of photosensitive constituents. Four extracts showed 100% viral inactivation at a variety of doses and light conditions: Macaranga pustulata (200 μg/ml in all 3 light conditions), Hypericum cordifolium (50 μg/ml in all 3 light conditions), Maesa macrophylla (100 μg/ml in all 3 light conditions), and Sibbaldia micropetala (200 μg/ml in all 3 light conditions and 100 μg/ml in visible light only). Additionally, 5 extracts were able to partially inhibit HSV-1 at varying doses and light conditions: Hypericum uralum (200 μg/ml in all 3 light conditions), Centipeda minima (13 μg/ml in all 3 light conditions), Corallodiscus lanuginosus (100 μg/ml in visible light only), Anemone obtusiloba (100 μg/ml in all 3 light conditions), and Princepia utilis (200 μg/ml in UV-A and visible light only). Most of the extracts studied exhibited no cytotoxicity up to a dose of 200 μg/ml; however, H. cordifolium, M. macrophylla, and A. obtusiloba showed cytotoxicity at this dose. Additionally, C. minima exhibited cytotoxicity at a dose of 25 μg/ml.
