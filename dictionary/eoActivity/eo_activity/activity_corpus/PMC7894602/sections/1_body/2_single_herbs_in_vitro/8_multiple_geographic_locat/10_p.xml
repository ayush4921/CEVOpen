 </sup> studied the ethanolic extracts of Ficus benjamina (leaf, fruit, stem) and Lilium candidum (leaf, petal, bulb) for antiviral effect on HSV-1 (strain ATCC-VR-735) and HSV-2. Leaf extracts of both plants showed strong viral inhibition toward both viruses, while the other extracts failed to show significant effects. The most pronounced effects were observed when the extracts were added simultaneously with the virus, rather than being added to cells post-infection. The leaf extract of F. benjamina (SI = 980 for HSV-1; SI ∼800 for HSV-2) was found to have a greater SI for both viruses than acyclovir (SI ∼700 for HSV-1; SI ∼300 for HSV-2), and significantly greater than the leaf extract of L. candidum (SI = 87.5 for HSV-1; SI = 35 for HSV-2). Both extracts were also found to be synergistic with acyclovir.
