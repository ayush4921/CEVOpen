 </sup> used an acyclovir-resistant strain of HSV-1 to assess the antiherpetic activity of leaf and fruit ethyl acetate extracts of Vitex polygama. Maximum non-cytotoxic concentrations were determined as 25 μg/ml and 50 μg/ml for the leaf and fruit extracts, respectively, and used for all testing. Both extracts were observed to inhibit HSV-1 when cells were pretreated. The leaf extract showed 73.7% inhibition while the fruit extract showed 85.2% inhibition. Additionally, the leaf extract was able to disrupt intracellular activity by 60.2% while the fruit extract had a direct virucidal effect by inhibiting 73.1% of virions. Neither extract could prevent HSV-1 attachment to host cells. As such, the leaf extract would likely be more applicable to use during HSV infection, whereas the fruit extract may have more of an effect when used to prevent infection.
