 </sup> compared the antiherpetic activity of Mentha suaveolens essential oil against HSV-1 (strain F) to that of the essential oil from Melaleuca alternifolia. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> and SI values, respectively, were found to be 5.1 μg/ml and 67 for M. suaveolens essential oil and 13.2 μg/ml and 44 for M. alternifolia essential oil. These values suggest greater antiviral capabilities of M. suaveolens compared to M. alternifolia. Interestingly, when each essential oil was combined with acyclovir, additive antiviral effects were observed. Additionally, each extract was shown to inhibit intracellular viral metabolism, but not to prevent viral adsorption.
