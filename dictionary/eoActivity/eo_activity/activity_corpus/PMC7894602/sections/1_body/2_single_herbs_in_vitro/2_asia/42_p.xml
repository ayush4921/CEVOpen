 </sup> also tested anti-HSV-1 activity of Quercus brantii. A crude extract of the plant’s acorns was prepared using ethyl alcohol, and effects against HSV-1 (strain KOS) were examined in baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells. The extract exhibited antiviral activity against HSV-1 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 4.3 μg/ml and SI = 48.4), but was not more potent than acyclovir (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.3 μg/ml and SI = 136.5). Additional experiments found that the greatest viral inhibition occurred when the extract was present both during and after adsorption.
