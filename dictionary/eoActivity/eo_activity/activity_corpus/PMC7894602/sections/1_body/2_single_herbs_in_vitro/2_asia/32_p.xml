 </sup> Experiments were conducted with infection of the KOS strain of HSV-1 into human neuroblastoma (SK-N-SH) cells and treatment with 600 Î¼g/ml of aqueous extracts of the root of R. isatidis and the whole plant of V. yedoensis. Only V. yedoensis showed inhibition of viral replication. Antiviral effects were similar when the cells were pretreated with the extract 6 hours before infection and treatment to cells 4 hours post-infection. The authors suggested that the mechanism of action is likely not one of direct inactivation of HSV-1.
