 </sup> A total of 13 extracts demonstrated complete inhibition of viral cytopathic effects. These included extracts from Vismia macrophylla (MIC = 5.5 μg/ml), Symphonia globulifera (MIC = 25 μg/ml), Eschweilera rufifolia (MIC = 8 μg/ml), Byrsonima verbascifolia (MIC = 6.5 μg/ml for root bark extract; MIC = 2.5 μg/ml for leaf extract), Iryanthera megistophylla (MIC = 10 μg/ml), Virola multinervia (MIC = 11.5 μg/ml for resin extract; MIC = 17 μg/ml for bark extract), Myrteola nummulari (MIC = 10.5 μg/ml), Polygonum punctatum (MIC = 20 μg/ml), Adiantum latifolium (MIC = 11.5 μg/ml), Ampelozizyphus amazonicus (MIC = 22 μg/ml), and Duroia hirsuta (MIC = 10.5 μg/ml). Of these extracts, the most notable was the B. verbascifolia leaf extract, which completely inhibited HSV-1 activity at a low concentration of 2.5 μg/ml.
