 </sup> found Vachellia nilotica bark extracts prepared with methanol (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 4.71 μg/ml and SI = 30.6), water (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 10.2 μg/ml and SI = 18.6), and chloroform (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 12.3 μg/ml and SI = 15.4) exhibited antiviral activity against HSV-2 (strain ATCC-VR540). Acyclovir was also tested and demonstrated EC
 <sub>50</sub> and SI values of 3.17 μg/ml and &gt;468, respectively. Against an acyclovir-resistant strain of HSV-2, the methanolic extract showed antiviral activity (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 6.71 μg/ml and SI = 21.5), suggesting a different mechanism of action compared to acyclovir. Additionally, the methanolic extract was observed to reduce viral load when added during infection, but only mildly reduce viral load when added after infection. The methanolic extract did not prevent infection in pretreated cells.
