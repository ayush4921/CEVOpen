 </sup> made 5 different extracts from the latex of Ficus carica and the solvents hexane, ethyl acetate, methanol, chloroform, and hexane-ethyl acetate. None of the extracts showed cytotoxic effects to Vero cells at concentrations up to 100 mg/ml, except 100 mg/ml of the chloroform extract. The hexane and hexane-ethyl acetate extracts showed greatest inhibition of HSV-1 by preventing viral penetration, adsorption, and intracellular replication at all concentrations tested. Specifically, the concentrations of these 2 extracts ranged from 78 Î¼g/ml to 100 mg/ml.
