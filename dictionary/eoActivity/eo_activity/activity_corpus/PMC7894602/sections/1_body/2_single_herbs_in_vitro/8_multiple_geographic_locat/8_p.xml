 </sup> observed aqueous and ethyl acetate extracts of Tanacetum vulgare to exhibit antiherpetic activity against HSV-1. The ethyl acetate extract (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 40 μg/ml and SI = 3.9) showed slightly more potent effects than the aqueous extract (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 55 μg/ml and SI = 2.2). Further experiments were conducted with an isolated compound, and the authors concluded that T. vulgare most likely exhibits antiviral activity by interfering with HSV-1 replication.
