 </sup> investigated antiviral effects of methanolic extracts of 5 varieties of marine algae against wild-type (strain 7401 H), thymidine kinase-deficient (strain B2006), and acyclovir and phosphonoacetic acid-resistant HSV-1 strains. All extracts were tested at a dose of 100 µg/ml, and Sargassum ringgoldianum inhibited 100% plaque formation of all 3 HSV-1 strains, but exhibited strong cytotoxicity to Vero cells. Symphyocladia latiuscula demonstrated moderate cytotoxicity, inhibited 100% plaque formation against wild-type HSV-1, and 82.74% against acyclovir and phosphonoacetic acid-resistant HSV-1; however, thymidine kinase-deficient HSV-1 plaques were only inhibited by 38.1%. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of S. latiuscula was determined as 56.7 µg/ml (HSV-1 strain not specified). Moderate plaque inhibition was also noted against acyclovir and phosphonoacetic acid-resistant HSV-1 with the extracts of Sargassum thunbergii, Ecklonia stolonifera, and Ulva pertusa, demonstrating 55.99%, 47.79%, and 40.67% inhibition, respectively. S. thunbergii and U. pertusa showed no cytotoxicity, while E. stolonifera was mildly cytotoxic to Vero cells. The methanolic extract of S. latiuscula was successively fractionated into 5 fractions using the following order of solvents: hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, butanol, and water. The dichloromethanic fraction showed the strongest anti-HSV-1 activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 7.73 µg/ml (HSV-1 strain not specified).
