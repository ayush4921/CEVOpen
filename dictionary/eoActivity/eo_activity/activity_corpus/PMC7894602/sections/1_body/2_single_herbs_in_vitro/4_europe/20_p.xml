 </sup> for its ability to prevent viral adsorption and delay viral incubation of HSV-1. The greatest antiviral activity was seen when Vero cells were pretreated with an aqueous extract of G. glabra and incubated with HSV-1 for only 1 hour. Additionally, cells were treated with HSV-1, incubated for 1 hour, washed, and treated with a non-cytotoxic dose of the extract after 1, 4, 8, and 12 hours. The most significant results, compared to control, were seen from treatment after hours 1 and 12. The authors speculate that the antiviral capacity of G. glabra comes from either direct viral inhibition or prevention of the viral attachment to host cells. The authors also suggest that G. glabra may interfere with viral gene expression due to results implying the extract was able to delay viral replication.
