 </sup> for antiherpetic activity against the HSV-1 KOS strain, 29-R/acyclovir-resistant strain, and a clinical strain. A crude hydroethanolic extract of the plant demonstrated EC
 <sub>50</sub> and SI values, respectively, of 10.20 μg/ml and &gt;49 against strain KOS, 13.9 μg/ml and &gt;35.9 against strain 29-R, and 14.2 μg/ml and &gt;34.9 against the clinical strain. Further testing revealed the extract elicited its antiviral effects by inhibiting viral attachment and penetration when the extract was added during the adsorption and infection viral stages. However, little effects were noted on viral infectivity when virions were pretreated with the extract. Interestingly, the extract showed to have a synergistic effect with acyclovir when the 2 were tested in combination.
