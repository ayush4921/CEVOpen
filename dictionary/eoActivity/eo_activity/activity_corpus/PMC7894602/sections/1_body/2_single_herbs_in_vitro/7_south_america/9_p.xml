 </sup> made petroleum ether, dichloromethane, ethanolic and/or water extracts from 10 Columbian medicinal plants from the Euphorbia genus and assessed antiherpetic activity against HSV-2. The species assessed were E. cestrifolia, E. cotinifolia, E. tirucalli, E. arenaria, and E. pulcherrima, E. heterophyla, E. cyatophora, E. graminea, E. cf. cotinifolia, and Euphorbia sp. Additional water-methanol (20:80) extracts were made from fresh parts of E. tirucalli and E. cotinifolia. Strong antiviral activity was seen from the hydromethanolic extracts of the leaves and stems of E. tirucalli (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 140.2 mg/ml and SI &gt;7.13) and E. cotinifolia (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 104.6 mg/ml and SI &gt;9.56), and moderate antiviral activity was seen from the ethanolic extracts of the stems of E. cotinifolia (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 75.6 mg/ml and SI = 1.59), E. cestrifolia (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 160.1 mg/ml and SI = 1.41) and E. tirucalli (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 64.3 mg/ml and SI = 3.46) and the dichloromethane extracts of the leaves of E. cotinifolia (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 36.8 mg/ml and SI = 4.08) and E. cestrifolia (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 59.8 mg/ml and SI = 2.83). The greatest inhibitory effects were observed from the hydromethanolic extracts of E. tirucalli and E. cotinifolia. It is important to note that these 2 extracts were not found to be cytotoxic at any dose studied, but their inhibitory action was lower than that of acyclovir (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.8 mg/ml and SI = 31,600). The authors believe that the antiviral activity of E. tirucalli and E. cotinifolia is acceptable and that these plants are good candidates for further research.
