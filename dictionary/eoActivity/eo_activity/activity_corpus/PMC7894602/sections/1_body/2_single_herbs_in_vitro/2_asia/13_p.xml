<p>Furthermore, the effect of 31 Chinese herbs known for their antipyretic and anti-inflammatory actions were studied for their actions against HSV-1 by Hsiang et al.

 </sup> Methanolic extracts of the herbs were first tested, and those that exhibited inhibitory effects on viral plaques were subsequently made into extracts using cold water, hot water, ethanol, ethanolic acid, and methanol. Significant reduction in plaque numbers were achieved with the ethanolic extract of Rheum officinale (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.12 μg/ml and SI = 8.3), hot water extract of Sophora flavescens (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.41 μg/ml and SI = 8.4), hot water (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.20 μg/ml and SI = 9.1), cold water (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.36 μg/ml and SI = 8.4), and methanolic (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.06 μg/ml and SI = 12.3) extracts of Paeonia suffruticosa, and methanolic (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.03 μg/ml and SI = 8.0) and ethanolic acid (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.02 μg/ml and SI = 8.0) extracts of Melia toosendan. The authors deemed a SI of 8.0 or greater as being significant. Subsequent testing revealed greater than 95% of inhibition of viral attachment with the aqueous and methanolic extracts of P. suffruiticosa, ethanolic acid extracts of M. toosendan, and ethanolic extract of R. officinale. Also, inhibition of 65% of viral penetration was observed with methanolic extracts of P. suffruticosa and the ethanolic extract of R. officinale. The authors concluded that the studied herbs acted as antiviral agents at various stages of HSV-1 infection, therefore herpes simplex infections may be treated by different herbs at different times during the viral replication cycle.
