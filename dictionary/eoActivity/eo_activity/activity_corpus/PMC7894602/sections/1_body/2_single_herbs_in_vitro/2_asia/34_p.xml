 </sup> observed a methanolic extract of Zataria multiflora to significantly inhibit HSV-1 (strain KOS) plaque formation at doses below its maximum non-toxic concentration (1000 μg/ml). When the extract was added to cells during viral adsorption at doses of 800 μg/ml, 500 μg/ml, and 250 μg/ml, inhibition of 100%, 93.2%, and 86.2%, respectively, of HSV-1 plaques was observed. Additionally, the extract was added to cells at 1, 2, and 3 hours after viral infection, and 100% plaque inhibition was observed with all doses, which ranged 250-1000 μg/ml.
