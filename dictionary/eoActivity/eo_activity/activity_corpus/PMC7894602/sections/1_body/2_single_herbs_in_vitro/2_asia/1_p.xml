 </sup> observed aqueous extracts of Pongamia pinnata to completely inhibit HSV-1 (strain AC) and HSV-2 (strain HV-219) replication at concentrations of 1 mg/ml and 20 mg/ml, respectively. Experiments were carried out using African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells and the seeds of the plant were used to prepare the extracts. Extracts were added to cells after viral inoculation, and complete inhibition was noted at 24 hours. Extract concentrations lower than 1 mg/ml and 20 mg/ml were less effective.
