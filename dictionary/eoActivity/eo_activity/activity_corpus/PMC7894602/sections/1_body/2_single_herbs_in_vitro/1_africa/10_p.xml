 </sup> found a methanolic extract of Avicenna marina leaves to exhibit antiviral effects against HSV-2. This plant is native to Southern Africa and traditionally used to treat ulcers, rheumatism, and smallpox. The greatest inhibition was seen at a concentration of 20 μg/ml where the extract inhibited 80% of HSV-2 replication. The EC
 <sub>50</sub> and SI values for the extract were determined to be 10 μg/ml and 25, respectively, and no cytotoxic effects were noted up to a concentration of 32 μg/ml.
