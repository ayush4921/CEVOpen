 </sup> against HSV-1 (strain KOS) and HSV-2 (strain HG52) using a hydroethanolic extract and the plantâ€™s pressed juice. Aerial parts were used to make extracts with 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% aqueous ethanol as well as a pressed juice that was subsequently mixed with 96% ethanol as a preservative. All hydroalcoholic extracts showed dose-dependent antiviral activity, but the most significant antiviral activity was found from the pressed juice (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.001% and SI = 22,700 for HSV-1; IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.0002% and SI = 113,500 for HSV-2). The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values against HSV-1 for the 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% ethanolic extracts were 0.03% (SI = 506), 0.001% (SI = 8400), 0.005% (SI = 1100), and 0.007% (SI = 514), respectively. Additionally, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values against HSV-2 for the 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% ethanolic extracts were 0.007% (SI = 2171), 0.01% (SI = 840), 0.006% (SI = 916), and 0.004% (SI = 900), respectively. Time-of-addition experiments showed that the pressed juice was highly effective against HSV virions both intra- and extracellularly, while the hydroethanolic extracts affected virions extracellularly.
