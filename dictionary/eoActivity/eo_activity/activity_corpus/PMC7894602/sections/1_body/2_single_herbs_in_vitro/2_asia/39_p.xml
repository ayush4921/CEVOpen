 </sup> Hydromethanolic extracts of the root, twig, and stem of the plant were separately prepared. The root extract exhibited the strongest antiviral activity of the 3 extracts with IC
 <sub>50</sub> and SI values of 284.2 Î¼g/ml and 13.3, respectively. A subsequent study by the authors showed the extract elicits its effect early in the viral replication cycle by blocking HSV-2 attachment, adsorption, and entry into host cells.
