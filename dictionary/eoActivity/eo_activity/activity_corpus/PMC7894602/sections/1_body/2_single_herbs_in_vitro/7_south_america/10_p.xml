<p>Significant inhibitory and virucidal action against acyclovir-resistant HSV-1 was observed from a 1:1 sodium chloride: glycerol extract of the seeds of Licania tomentosa by Miranda et al.

 </sup> The ED
 <sub>50</sub> and SI values of 9 μg/ml and 851, respectively, were calculated. Further experiments were conducted at the extract’s maximum non-cytotoxic concentration, which was determined as 625 μg/ml. Viral inhibition of 90% was observed when the cells were pretreated with the extract for 3-4 hours at 37°C prior to infection, but the extract was cytotoxic if cells were pretreated at 4°C. When the extract was added to acyclovir-resistant HSV-1 directly, 59% of virions were inactivated. Addition of the extract after viral attachment resulted in 92.7% inhibition, but addition 2 hours post-infection only inhibited 74.4% of the virus.
