 </sup> The extract encouraged wound healing in L-929 cells, demonstrating a fivefold increase in wound healing at 48 hours and a 3-fold increase at 72 hours compared to control. In addition, the extract inhibited viral replication in Vero cells, demonstrating EC
 <sub>50</sub> and SI values of 3.1 Î¼g/ml and 18.1, respectively.
