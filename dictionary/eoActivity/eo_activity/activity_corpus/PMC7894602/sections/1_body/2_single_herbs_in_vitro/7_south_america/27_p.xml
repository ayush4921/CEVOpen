 </sup> assessed the antiviral actions of an ethyl acetate extract from the stem bark of Strychnos pseudoquina against HSV-2 strain 333, and HSV-1 strains KOS and 29-R/acyclovir-resistant. When extract and virus were administered simultaneously to cells, the extract demonstrated IC
 <sub>50</sub> and SI values, respectively, of 5.29 μg/ml and 10.16 for HSV-1 strain KOS and 6.55 μg/ml and 8.21 for HSV-2. When the extract was administered post-infection, it demonstrated IC
 <sub>50</sub> and SI values, respectively, of 22.2 μg/ml and 3.84 for HSV-1 strain KOS, 17.62 μg/ml and 3.05 for HSV-1 strain 29-R, and 8.64 μg/ml and 6.22 for HSV-2. Time-of-addition experiments revealed the extract had antiherpetic activity during viral adsorption (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.96 μg/ml and SI = 27.43 for HSV-1 strain KOS; IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 6.02 μg/ml and SI = 8.92 for HSV-2), post-adsorption (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 3.12 μg/ml and SI = 17.23 for HSV-1; IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 3.15 μg/ml and SI = 17.07 for HSV-2), and penetration (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 7.33 μg/ml and SI = 7.34 for HSV-1; IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 4.47 μg/ml and SI = 12.03 for HSV-2). Pretreatment of cells with the extract inhibited HSV-2 replication (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 7.56 μg/ml and SI = 7.11), but had no effect on HSV-1 replication.
