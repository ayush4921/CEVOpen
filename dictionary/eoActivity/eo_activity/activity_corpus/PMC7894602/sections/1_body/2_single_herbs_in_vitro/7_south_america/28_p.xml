 </sup> Viral plaques were reduced by 100% by extracts of E. giganteum, U. tomentosa, and C. reticulata at a concentration of 100 μg/ml and the C. lechleri extract at 30 μg/ml. IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for the E. giganteum, U. tomentosa, C. reticulata, and C. lechleri extracts were found to be 18 μg/ml, 28 μg/ml, 50 μg/ml, and 10 μg/ml, respectively, and SI values were calculated as &gt;55.56, &gt;35.71, 10, and &gt;100, respectively. All extracts demonstrated virucidal effects and prevented viral adsorption, but were not effective at inhibiting viral replication or preventing infection with pretreatment of cells.
