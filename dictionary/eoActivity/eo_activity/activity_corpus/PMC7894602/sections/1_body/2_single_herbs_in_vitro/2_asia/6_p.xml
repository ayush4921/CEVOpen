The plant extracts that showed anti-HSV activity were Alternanthera sessilis, Blumea chinensis, Calotropis gigantea, Costus speciosus, Eleusine indica, Eugenia michelii, Euphorbia hirta, Freycinetia malaccensis, Hedyotis auricularia, Leea indica, Mentha arvensis, Orthosiphon aristatus, Polygonum minus, Ricinus communis, and Solanum americanum. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for these extracts ranged 0.001-0.01 mg/ml. Furthermore, assays using HeLa cell lines were performed with these plant extracts to test for cytotoxicity. Of the 15 extracts, only E. michelii, M. arvensis, F. malaccensis, and P. minus showed cytotoxicity, with CD
