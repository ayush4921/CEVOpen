 </sup> screened a variety of plants for antiherpetic activity. Methanol or 1:9 of water: methanol extracts were created from the leaves, aerial parts, or cortex of Juglans mollis, Persea americana, Hamelia patens, Clematis drummondii, Salvia texana, and Salvia ballotaeflora. Also, ethyl acetate and ethyl ether extracts were created from the roots of Ceanothus coeruleus and Chrysactinia mexicana, respectively. The extracts were added after viral infection had been established in the Vero cells. The greatest antiviral activity was observed from the extract of S. ballotaeflora against both HSV-1 and HSV-2 with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 31 μg/ml and 16 μg/ml, respectively. This was followed by the extract of J. mollis with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 76 μg/ml and 126 μg/ml against HSV-1 and HSV-2, respectively. The SI values toward HSV-1 and HSV-2, respectively, were &gt;26.3 and &gt;15.8 for J. mollis and 7.5 and 14.6 for S. ballotaeflora. SI values toward HSV-1 and HSV-2, respectively, for the other species studied were as follows: 5.0 and &lt;3.4 for P. americana; &gt;4 and &gt;9.4 for H patens, 1.9 and 7.5 for S texana, 5.45 and 3.8 for C. coeruleus, &gt;11.7 and &gt;5.8 for C. mexicana, and &gt;4.3 and &gt;7.8 for C. drummondii.
