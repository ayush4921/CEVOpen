 </sup> investigated the antiviral activity of a methanolic extract of Lobelia chinensis against HSV-1 (strain KOS) in HeLa cells. The extract was found to inhibit plaque formation, demonstrating IC
 <sub>50</sub> and SI values of 139.2 Î¼g/ml and approximately 22.5, respectively. Time-of-addition experiments revealed the extract is effective if added in the window of 0-8 hours post-infection. Additionally, experiments revealed that L. chinensis is able to block HSV-1 replication, likely by impairing DNA synthesis.
