 </sup> Antiviral and virucidal activity as well as inhibition of viral adsorption of HSV-1 were investigated. The crude extract (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 4.59 μg/ml and SI &gt;87) demonstrated stronger antiviral activity than the aqueous fraction (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 12.5 μg/ml and SI &gt;32) or ethyl acetate fraction (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 11.1 μg/ml and SI &gt;35.97). Time-of-addition experiments revealed the extract and fractions were most effective when added to cells at the time of infection. Greater inhibition of viral adsorption was seen with the ethyl acetate fraction, demonstrating 96.45% inhibition at 100 μg/ml. Moreover, 100% direct viral inhibition was elicited by 100 μg/ml, 50 μg/ml, and 25 μg/ml of the crude extract, aqueous fraction, and ethyl acetate fraction, respectively. The crude extract was also found to act as an antagonist to acyclovir while the 2 fractions acted synergistically.
