 </sup> tested an aqueous extract of the African medicinal plant Pelargonium sidoides for its ability to act against both HSV-1 (strain KOS) and HSV-2 (strain HG52). The extract was found to have antiviral activity in plaque reduction assays with African green monkey kidney (RC-37) cells. When applied at the maximum non-cytotoxic concentration (not specified), the extract was able to reduce plaque formation by 99% for both HSV-1 and HSV-2. Moreover, the extract was added to RC-37 cells at various times throughout the HSV life cycle and compared to acyclovir. The P. sidoides extract showed antiviral effects if added prior to HSV infection or if added during HSV adsorption, compared to acyclovir that exhibited antiviral effects only during HSV replication. The authors conclude that P. sidoides may be effective if used as a topical antiviral treatment at the onset of HSV infection.
