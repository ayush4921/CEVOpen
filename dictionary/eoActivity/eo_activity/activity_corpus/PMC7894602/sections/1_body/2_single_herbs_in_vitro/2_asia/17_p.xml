 </sup> explored the ability of 20 Thai medicinal plants to work as antivirals against 3 strains of HSV-1. Vero cells infected with wild-type HSV-1 (strain 7401 H) were treated with water, ethanolic, or chloroform plant extracts at a dose of 100 μg/ml. The extracts found to reduce plaque formation by at least 50%, therefore classified by the authors as having antiviral activity against HSV-1, were Aglaia odorata, Cerbera odollam, Harpullia arborea, Ventilago denticulata, Azadirachta indica, Protium serratum, Rinorea anguifera, Hura crepitans, Schima wallichi, and Moringa oleifera. The strongest antiviral effects were noted by the extracts of A. odorata, C. odollam, and V. denticulata that inhibited 100% of plaques at the 100 μg/ml dose. Furthermore, these 3 extracts were assessed for antiviral activity against thymidine kinase-deficient and phosphonoacetate-resistant HSV-1 strains and compared to the wild-type 7401 H strain. The use of acyclovir as a positive control showed that a higher dose of the drug was required to reduce plaque formation of the 2 resistant strains compared to wild-type HSV-1. It was observed that M. oleifera was most effective against the phosphonoacetate-resistant strain (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 43.5 μg/ml and SI = 20.1), and V. denticulata worked equally as well with all 3 strains (EC
 <sub>50</sub> and SI ranged 42.0-52.0 μg/ml and 16.1-20.0, respectively). However, A. odorata was less effective with the thymidine kinase-deficient strain (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 24.5 μg/ml and SI = 12.7) than the wild-type (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 9.5 μg/ml and SI = 32.8) or phosphonoacetate-resistant (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 10.8 μg/ml and SI = 28.9) strains.
