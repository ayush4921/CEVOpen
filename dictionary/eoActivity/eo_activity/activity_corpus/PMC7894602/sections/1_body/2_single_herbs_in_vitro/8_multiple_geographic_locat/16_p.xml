<p>Lastly, an ethanolic extract of Veronica persica was tested by Sharifi-Rad et al.

 </sup> for antiviral effects on HSV-1 and HSV-2. The extract was able to reduce viral load in a dose-dependent manner when added after infection. The SI was found to be 65 for HSV-1 and 45 for HSV-2. The ethanolic extract was further fractionated with 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% methanol. The most notable antiviral effect was observed by the 80% methanolic fraction (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.62 μg/ml and SI = 451.6 for HSV-1; IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.73 μg/ml and SI = 383.5 for HSV-2), whereas all other fractions demonstrated SI &lt;4. It should be acknowledged that the SI values achieved by the 80% methanolic fractions were greater than those observed by acyclovir (SI = 320 for HSV-1; SI = 300 for HSV-2). Moreover, time-of-addition experiments revealed that the greatest viral inhibition occurred when cells were treated with the 80% methanolic fraction at inoculation and again post-infection. Single treatment at or post-infection demonstrated weaker effects. Additionally, the 80% methanolic fraction demonstrated synergistic antiviral effects with acyclovir.
