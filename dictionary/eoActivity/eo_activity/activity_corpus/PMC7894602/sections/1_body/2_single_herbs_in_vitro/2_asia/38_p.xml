 </sup> found that EC
 <sub>50</sub> values for a methanolic extract of the plant ranged 48.5-52.6 μg/ml for the 4 viral strains with SI values of 8.29-9.00. The extract inhibited 99% of HSV-2 multiplication at a dose of 86.5 μg/ml by 2-4 hours post-infection. Acyclovir was tested as a control and shown to have EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 2.6-2.8 μg/ml and SI values of 46.00-49.53 for strain G and one of the clinical isolates. Further testing revealed the extract was able to inhibit NF-êB, which is activated during HSV-2 infection and required for viral replication.
