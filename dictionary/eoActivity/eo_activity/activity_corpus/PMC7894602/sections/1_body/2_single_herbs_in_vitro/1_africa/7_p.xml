 </sup> Four extracts from 3 plants exhibited antiherpetic activity, defined by the authors as inhibiting more than 50% of HSV-1. These extracts were the methanolic extract of Erica multiflora (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 132.6 μg/ml and SI &gt;3.77), the acetonic (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 489.5 μg/ml and SI &gt;1.02) and methanolic (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 486.2 μg/ml and SI &gt;1.03) extracts of Frankenia pulverulenta, and the acetonic extract of Zygophyllum album (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 390.7 μg/ml and SI &gt;1.28). Both the methanolic extract of E. multiflora and the acetonic extract of Z. album showed complete cell protection against HSV-1 at 2000 μg/ml.
