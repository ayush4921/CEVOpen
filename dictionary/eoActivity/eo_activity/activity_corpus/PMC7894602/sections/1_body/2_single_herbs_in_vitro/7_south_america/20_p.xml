 </sup> created ethanolic extracts from 24 South American plants and 4 South American algal species and tested for antiviral activity against HSV-1 (strain F). None of the algal species offered inhibitory action toward HSV-1, however, 14 of the plant extracts demonstrated viral inhibition. These plants were Achyrocline satureioides, Bauhinia candicans, Chenopodium ambrosioides, Limonium brasiliense, Margyricarpus pinnatus, Phyllanthus niruri, Polygonum punctatum, Psidium incanum, Psidium luridum, Schinus molle, Sesbania punicea, Smilax gracilis, Tillandsia aeranthos, and Tillandsia usneoides. EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of these plant extracts ranged 50-1500 μg/ml, and the highest SI values calculated were from P. niruri (42.37), P. incanum (14.89), and L. brasiliense (4.58). These 14 extracts were also tested for ability to directly inactivate HSV-1 virions at their respective maximum non-cytotoxic concentrations, and 6 showed virucidal activity, which was defined by the authors as inactivating ≥90% of viral particles. These extracts were C. ambrosioides, L. brasiliense, M. pinnatus, S. gracilis, T. aeranthos, and T. usneoides.
