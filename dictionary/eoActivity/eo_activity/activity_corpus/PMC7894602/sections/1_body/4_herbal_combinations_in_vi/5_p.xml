 </sup> investigated the ability of a herbal gel formulation to act as an antiviral on HSV-2 (strain G ATCC-VR-734). The gel was previously studied on ulcers caused by HIV-1, and the authors propose that there is a strong link between ulcers caused by HIV-1 and HSV-2. The gel contained 50% ethanolic extracts of Acacia catechu, Lagerstroemia speciosa, Terminalia chebula, and Phyllanthus emblica. The use of this gel formulation resulted in a greater decrease in HSV-2 attachment (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 46.55 μg/ml and SI = 68.30) and penetration (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 54.94 μg/ml and SI = 57.87) than seen when treating infected cells with acyclovir. When cells were treated post-infection, acyclovir (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.065 μg/ml SI = 69,082) had significantly greater inhibition than the formulation (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 469.05 μg/ml and SI = 6.78). However, when testing virucidal activity, the gel formulation (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 27.26 μg/ml and SI = 116.63) was significantly more potent on virions than acyclovir (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 124.50 μg/ml and SI = 3.61). Moreover, physiological effects were explored by applying the gel to normal human vaginal mucosa (Vk2/E6E7) cells. The gel did not decrease viability of local vaginal flora or the integrity of vaginal keratinocytes. It also did not increase mutagenic behavior or secretion of inflammatory cytokines. The authors conclude that these results are more applicable to patient care than results from non-human cell lines.
