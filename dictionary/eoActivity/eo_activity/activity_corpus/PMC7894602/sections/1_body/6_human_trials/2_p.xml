 </sup> demonstrated the antiviral effects of Melissa officinalis on HSV lesions. Lomaherpan cream containing 1% dried extract of M. officinalis was tested. The first trial tested the cream on HSV lesions without the use of a placebo-control group. The trial was conducted at 3 dermatology clinics on a total of 115 patients with HSV lesions of the skin or transitional mucosa for not more than 72 hours. Subjects were instructed to apply the cream to lesions 5 times daily until lesions completely healed. Lesions completely healed by day 4, 6, and 8 in 60%, 87%, and 96% of subjects, respectively. The authors believed the cream reduced healing time as HSV lesions naturally heal within 10 to 14 days. The second trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 116 patients with HSV lesions with the same inclusion criteria as the trial before. A cream that did not contain M. officinalis was used as placebo. Subjects were instructed to apply the cream to lesions 2 to 4 times daily for a period of 5 to maximum 10 days. Clinical symptoms between the treatment and placebo groups were not statistically different at baseline. On day two, significant reductions in symptoms and lesion swelling was noted in the treatment compared to the placebo group. On day five, complete resolution of symptoms was noted by 24 subjects in the treatment group compared to 15 subjects in the placebo group. Subjects’ and physicians’ assessments of healing were significantly greater for the treatment group compared to the placebo group. The trial provided evidence for the use of M. officinalis as a treatment for HSV lesions. The antiviral effect was found to be most significant if treatment was commenced as early as possible during the course of infection.
