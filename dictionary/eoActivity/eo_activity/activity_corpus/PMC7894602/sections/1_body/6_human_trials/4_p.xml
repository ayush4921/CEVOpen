 </sup> using a placebo-controlled, double blind, crossover trial with 50 participants. The strain of HSV present in each participant was confirmed and found to be a mix of HSV-1 and HSV-2. The extract used was a marketed compound called Echinaforce, made of the plant and root of E. purpurea. Treatment with placebo or 800 mg bid orally of the extract was given for 6 months followed by 6 months of treatment with the opposite arm. There was no significant difference found between E. purpurea or placebo at preventing or reducing the frequency of recurrence of herpes genitalis. Additionally, there were no significant differences between pain scores, duration of infection, or neutrophil count between placebo or extract.
