 </sup> explored the effect of a topical formulation of Hypericum perforatum and copper sulfate pentahydrate compared to that of topical 5% acyclovir on HSV lesions. The formulation is marketed as Dynamiclear and aims to treat HSV lesions with a one-time application. The authors explain that Dynamiclear would be a more cost-effective treatment compared to the topical 5% acyclovir as the latter requires multiple applications. A total of 149 participants with active HSV-1 or HSV-2 lesions between the ages of 18-55 were randomized to receive either a single treatment of Dynamiclear or topical 5% acyclovir for 14 days. Participants reported their symptoms and physical exams were evaluated on days 1, 2, 3, 8, and 14. The Dynamiclear group had lower reports of burning or stinging sensation and decreased ratings of acute pain, erythema, and vesiculation compared to the acyclovir group. In fact, the acyclovir group was 4 times more likely to have vesiculation than those treated with Dynamiclear. It is important to note that the Dynamiclear treatment was not associated with any adverse events or toxicity.
