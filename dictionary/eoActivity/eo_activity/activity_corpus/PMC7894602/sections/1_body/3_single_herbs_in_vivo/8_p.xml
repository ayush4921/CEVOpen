 </sup> assessed the water, ethanolic, or chloroform extracts of Aglaia odorata, Moringa oleifera, Ventilago denticulata, Cerbera odollam, and Willughbeia edulis for antiherpetic properties in female BALB/c mice. The mice were shaved and cutaneously infected with wild-type HSV-1 (strain 7401 H) and administered an extract orally in a dose of 250 mg/kg 8 hours prior to infection and then every 8 hours for 5 days. The size and development of skin lesions was significantly reduced in mice that were treated with A. odorata, M. oleifera, and V. denticulata. New female BALB/c mice were then virally infected and given either 5 mg/kg of acyclovir or 250 mg/kg of either A. odorata, M. oleifera, or V. denticulata every 8 hours for 2 weeks. All 3 plant extracts significantly reduced the development of vesicles in the local region, but only M. oleifera reduced mortality of the mice and increased survival times. The antiviral activities of A. odorata, M. oleifera, and V. denticulata were comparable to that of acyclovir.
