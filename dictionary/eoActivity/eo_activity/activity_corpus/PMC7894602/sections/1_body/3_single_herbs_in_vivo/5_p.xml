 </sup> also investigated the antiviral effects of R. javanica and its prophylactic ability with recurrent HSV-2 (strain Ito-1262) herpes genitalis in guinea pigs in a crossover study. First, female guinea pigs were intravaginally infected with HSV-2 and monitored for 1.5 months until lesions healed. After primary infection was alleviated, guinea pigs were given an aqueous extract of R. javanica or water for 2 months. R. javanica was administered through drinking water at an average dose of 625 mg/kg/day. After 2 months, there were notable decreases in the number of vesicles, time to heal, and severity of lesions. The second part of the crossover design was conducted once secondary infection was cleared. Guinea pigs that received placebo treatment were administered R. javanica for 2 to 3 months, and those that previously received R. javanica were given either water or a new extract of T. chebula for the same duration. Both extracts were dosed on average at 625 mg/kg/day. In guinea pigs who received R. javanica followed by water, infection was not immediately triggered by discontinuation of the extract. However, treatment with R. javanica reduced the number, severity, and prevalence of lesions. The authors note that by maintaining similar results after crossover, R. javanica potentially provided prophylactic relief from recurrent HSV-2 infection.
