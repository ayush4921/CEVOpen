 </sup> explored the efficacy of a methanolic extract of the root tubers of Stephania cepharantha at fighting off HSV-1 (strain 7401 H) infection in BALB/c mice. After cutaneously infecting mice with HSV-1, the extract was orally administered at 125 or 250 mg/kg of body weight. The extract led to a decrease in the number and development of vesicles and an increase in survival time of mice.
