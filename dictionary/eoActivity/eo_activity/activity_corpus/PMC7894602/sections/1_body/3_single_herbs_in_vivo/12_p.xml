 </sup> tested the therapeutic effect of a hydromethanolic extract of Indigofera heterantha on HSV-2 infection in BALB/c mice. The authors had previously found the extract to demonstrate antiviral activity in vitro by blocking HSV-2 attachment, adsorption, and entry into host cells. The extract was formulated into a cream to be used for topical application at the genital region of mice. Mice were vaginally inoculated with HSV-2 (strain G) and administered 375, 750, or 1500 mg/kg of cream 3 times a day for 5 days, starting at 30 minutes post-infection. Treatment with 375 and 1500 mg/kg of cream resulted in 100% survival for the mice, and treatment with 750 mg/kg resulted in 87.5% survival. In terms of effects on lesion formation, clinical symptoms, and extravaginal disease, only treatment with 1500 mg/kg showed 100% reduction. Further experiments tested the prophylactic ability of the extract cream. Treatment with 125 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg at 2 and 4 hours pre-infection resulted in 100% survival and significant reductions in lesion scores. The authors conclude that I. heterantha has the potential to both treat and prevent genital herpes infection.
