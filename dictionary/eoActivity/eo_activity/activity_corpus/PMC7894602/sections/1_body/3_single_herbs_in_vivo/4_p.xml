 </sup> tested hot water extracts of G. japonicum, R. javanica, S. aromaticum, and T. chebula for their ability to prevent recurrent HSV-1 infection in BALB/c mice that were infected with the virus 4 months prior and exposed to ultraviolet irradiation. The extracts, or water as control, were administered orally to the mice 3 times per day for 10 days at a total dose of 750 mg/kg/day. The UV irradiation began on day six. The extracts were shown to reduce incidence of recurrence, reduce the severity of vesicles, and decrease the duration of lesions if they occurred. The prophylactic treatment also reduced the ability to detect viral DNA in the trigeminal ganglion or pinna of the mice. The strongest prophylactic response was observed in mice treated with the S. aromaticum extract.
