 </sup> Kanzo-bushi-to is the Japanese name for the Chinese formula Gan Cao Fu Zhi Tang. The authors chose to use thermally-injured mice because they are approximately 100 times more susceptible to herpes infection than non-thermally-injured mice. A hot water extract was made from Kanzo-bushi-to, which is a combination of Aconitum carmichaelii, Atractyloidis lanceae, Cinnamomum verum, and Glycyrrhiza glabra at a ratio of 2:12:7:4. Mice were thermally injured and 1 day later were inoculated with HSV-1 (strain KOS). The extract was administered intraperitoneally on days one and 4 post-injury at a dose of 5 mg/kg. The extract significantly reduced the mortality rate of mice, demonstrating a rate of 10% compared to 95% in controls. Further experiments showed that CD8
 <sup>+</sup> ST-cell activities were reduced in mice treated with the extract. This is an important finding because an increase in CD8
 <sup>+</sup> ST cell activity is involved in the increased susceptibility to infection of thermally-injured mice. Additionally, an accelerated generation of Contra-ST-cells was observed in mice treated with the extract, which likely explains the reduction in CD8
 <sup>+</sup> ST cell activity. The authors conclude that an aqueous extract of Kanzo-bushi-to reduced the susceptibility to HSV-1 infection in thermally-injured mice by expanding the generation of Contra-ST-cells
