<p>This review has several limitations. First of all, the use of different outcome measures among the studies reviewed poses a challenge to compare results. Several studies calculated SI values of plant extracts against herpes simplex virus infections, while others only reported their CC
 <sub>50</sub>, TD
 <sub>50</sub>, IC
 <sub>50</sub>, and/or ED
 <sub>50</sub> values. Furthermore, some of the studies reviewed reported none of these outcome measures. Reporting the CC
 <sub>50</sub> or TD
 <sub>50</sub> with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> or ED
 <sub>50</sub> is important to be able to fully evaluate the therapeutic potential of an extract and compare potential between extracts. For example, if an extract has a high ED
 <sub>50</sub>, but a low CC
 <sub>50</sub>, it will be cytotoxic to cells before it shows significant antiviral activity, and this will correspond to a low SI. On the other hand, a low ED
 <sub>50</sub> with a high CC
 <sub>50</sub> would give an extract a high safety profile, as it would elicit antiviral effects before any signs of cytotoxicity, which would correspond to a high SI. In some studies, missing SI values could be calculated, but in others, this was not possible if only the CC
 <sub>50</sub>/TD
 <sub>50</sub> or IC
 <sub>50</sub>/ED
 <sub>50</sub> was reported. In these cases, efficacy is open to interpretation.
