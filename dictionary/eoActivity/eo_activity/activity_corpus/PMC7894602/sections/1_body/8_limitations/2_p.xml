<p>Secondly, SI ranges or cut-off values that represent mild, moderate, or strong antiviral activity varied among studies. A possible reason for this discrepancy could be the dose of virus used in the studies. For example, an extract demonstrating an SI of 20 may be considered as having strong antiviral activity by one group of authors, while another group may classify it as having moderate effects. This, paired with varying doses of HSV-1 and HSV-2 virions administered to cells, makes it difficult to compare the absolute antiviral effects of extracts.</p>
