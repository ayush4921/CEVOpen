<p>In addition, a heat map (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00124-f004">Figure 4</xref>) was employed to demonstrate the distribution of all the data and to portray the relative intensities of the various metabolites throughout different species, which provides immediate visualization of information for easier understanding of the complexity of data. The colors indicate the relative content of each identified metabolite among the different species, as determined by the average peak response area by GC-MS.
