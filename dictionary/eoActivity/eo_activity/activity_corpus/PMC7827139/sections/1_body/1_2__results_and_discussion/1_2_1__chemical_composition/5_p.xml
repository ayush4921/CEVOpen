<p>Our results are in accordance with previous work on 
 <italic>A. microcephalis</italic>, which showed the presence of hexadecanoic acid, heneicosane, α-cadinene, and tridecanol as the major components [
 <xref rid="B7-plants-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In addition, the essential oils from dried aerial parts of 
 <italic>A. sericans</italic> and 
 <italic>A. oocephalus</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>stachyophorus</italic> revealed α-pinene as the major component in 
 <italic>A. sericans</italic>, whereas camphor, γ-terpineol, 1,8-cineole, and α-pinene were the major identified components of 
 <italic>A. oocephalus</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>stachyophorus</italic>, with their percentages being comparable to those in our oils.
