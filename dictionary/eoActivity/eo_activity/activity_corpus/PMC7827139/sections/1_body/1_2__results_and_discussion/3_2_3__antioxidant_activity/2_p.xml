<p>The results displayed in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00124-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> revealed that most of the samples showed considerable antioxidant potential in the assays. 
 <italic>A. mucidus</italic> displayed the highest antioxidant activity (1.57 ± 0.08 mmol TE/g sample) in the PM assay followed by 
 <italic>A. lehmannianus</italic> (1.31 ± 0.12 mmol TE/g sample), although without a statistically significant difference (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). Regarding the DPPH assay, 
 <italic>A. macronyx</italic> exhibited the maximum activity (24.12 ± 2.24 mg TE/g sample), followed by 
 <italic>A. lehmannianus</italic> (21.90 ± 0.76 mg TE/g sample). 
 <italic>A. mucidus</italic> (91.54 ± 1 mg TE/g sample) showed the highest antioxidant potential followed by 
 <italic>A. macronyx</italic> (82.65 ± 4.94 mg TE/g sample) in the ABTS assay. Concerning the CUPRAC and FRAP assays, 
 <italic>A. lehmannianus</italic> revealed the best activity, equivalent to 84.06 ± 0.57 mg TE/g oil and 49.47 ± 0.13 mg TE/g oil, respectively, followed by 
 <italic>A. macronyx</italic>, which showed antioxidant potential of 80.28 ± 2.65 mg TE/g oil and 49.02 ± 2.32 mg TE/g oil. 
 <italic>A. campylotrichus</italic> exhibited the most significant antioxidant power in the ferrous ion chelating assay (FIC, 51.69 ± 5.94 mg EDTAE/g sample), followed by 
 <italic>A. macronyx</italic> (38.00 ± 0.88 mg EDTAE/g sample). Thus, it can be concluded that the essential oils from both 
 <italic>A. lehmannianus</italic> and 
 <italic>A. macronyx</italic> displayed the most significant antioxidant properties, as demonstrated by their prominent activities in most of the performed antioxidant assays. 
 <italic>A. chiwensis</italic> exhibited moderate antioxidant activity in all reported assays.
