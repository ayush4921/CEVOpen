<p>The essential oils of different 
 <italic>Astragalus</italic> species showed wide metabolic variation both qualitatively and quantitatively. Monoterpene hydrocarbons represented the major class solely in 
 <italic>A. sieversianus</italic> (
 <italic>Asi</italic>), accounting for 68.47% of the total oil composition. On the contrary, monoterpene hydrocarbons were completely absent in 
 <italic>A. campylotrichus</italic> (
 <italic>Aca</italic>). No oxygenated sesquiterpenes were detected in any species.
