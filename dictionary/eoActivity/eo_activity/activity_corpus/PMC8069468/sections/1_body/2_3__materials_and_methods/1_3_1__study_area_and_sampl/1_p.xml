<p>In May 2018, deep ploughing experimental fields were formed in four locations in Lithuania: A (in the Petronys village, Pakruojis district, northern Lithuania; 56°12′10.5″ N, 23°56′26.1″ E), B (in the Gintalai village, Telšiai district, northwestern Lithuania; 55°44′45.2″ N, 22°21′13.6″ E), C (in the Medsėdžiai village, Klaipėda district, western Lithuania; 55°39′26.7″ N, 21°28′53.2″ E), and D (in the Botanical Garden of Klaipėda University, Klaipėda city, western Lithuania; 55°45′02.5″ N, 21°08′02.5″ E). The experimental fields in different locations were 18 square meters in area (1 × 18 m
 <sup>2</sup>). Each experimental field in all locations consisted of black soil. The cultivation technology applied was also the same in all places. Oregano seedlings were planted in the first year. In June 2019 (dry season), the soil (in the arable layer of a 0–20 cm depth) and perennial 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> samples were taken at three sites (beginning, middle, end) of each experimental field. A metal probe (drill) for soil sampling was using. Two to three plants were taken from one point. Three samples of soil and 3 samples of plants were collected from each experimental field. Each sample was placed in separate bags. Thus, a total of 12 samples of soil and 12 samples of the tested plants were collected. The collected plant material (stems, leaves and flowers) was air-dried in darkness at an ambient temperature. The dried plant material was cut up and stored in paper bags (
