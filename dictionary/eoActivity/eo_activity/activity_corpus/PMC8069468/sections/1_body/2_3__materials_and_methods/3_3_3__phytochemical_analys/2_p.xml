<p>The extraction of dried and ground plant samples was carried out in 2 stages using an 80% ethanol solution. A total of 2 g of plant material (accurately weighed) was placed in a conical flask, where 20 mL of 80% ethanol was added; the flask was closed with a stopper, weighed, and left alone for 1 h. Then, the flask was connected to a reflux condenser, heated to boiling in a water bath, and the liquid was kept at a slight boil for 30 min. The liquid was thoroughly shaken and filtered through a dry filter into a dry flask. The residue was re-poured with 20 mL of ethanol solution and boiled again for 30 min. It was filtered by transferring the rest of the plant material to the filter and by washing with portions of 80% ethanol. The filtrates were combined until reaching a total of 50 mL, and used for determination.</p>
