<p>The determination of flavonoids was carried out using the reaction of complexation with aluminum chloride [
 <xref rid="B53-plants-10-00750" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. To determine the total content of flavonoids, 2 mL of the analyzed solution was placed in a 25 mL volumetric flask; 1 mL of a 10% solution of aluminum chloride in ethanol was added until reaching the mark with 96% alcohol. After 30 min, the optical density of the solution was measured on an Agilent 8453 spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 410 nm. A mixture of 2 mL of a sample, 0.1 mL of concentrated acetic acid, and 96% ethanol to 25 mL was used as a reference solution. To construct the calibration line, rutin was used in the concentration range of 0.01 to 0.54 g/L.
