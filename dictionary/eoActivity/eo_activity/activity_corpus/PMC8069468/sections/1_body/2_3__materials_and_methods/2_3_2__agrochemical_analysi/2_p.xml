<p>Soil pH was measured in a 1M KCl suspension according to the standard ISO 10390:2005 [
 <xref rid="B47-plants-10-00750" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] (soil-solution ratio 1:2.5) using a pH-meter IONLAB. Humus was found by determination of organic carbon (C) by the Tyurin method modified by Nikitin [
 <xref rid="B48-plants-10-00750" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] using a spectrophotometer Cary 50 (VARIAN). A correction factor of 1.724 was used to calculate humus from organic C. Soil total nitrogen (N
 <sub>total</sub>) was determined by the Kjeldahl method according to the standard ISO 11261:1995 [
 <xref rid="B49-plants-10-00750" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], plant-available/mobile phosphorus (P
