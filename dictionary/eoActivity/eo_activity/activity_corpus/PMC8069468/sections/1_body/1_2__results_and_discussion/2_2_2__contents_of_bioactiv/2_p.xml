<p>The total phenolic content in plants growing in the different experimental fields ranged from 2.98 to 3.69%. Therefore, in the investigated plants, a lower quantity of phenolic compounds was found in our study than in 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> from countries with warmer climates [

 <xref rid="B35-plants-10-00750" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. This may also be due to the chemotypic features of the studied samples of 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic>, since the literature contains numerous data on the existence of several chemotypes differing in composition and amount of phenolic and terpene compounds in the essential oils of oregano [

 <xref rid="B38-plants-10-00750" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In European populations of oregano, the chemotype of linalool predominates; there is also a cymyl chemotype or sabinyl chemotype that co-occurs with a sesquiterpene-type poor in monoterpenes [

Chemotypes with a relatively low content of phenolic compounds can also be valuable from a practical point of view, since they usually have a more pleasant floral aroma, which is associated with higher concentrations of linalool, and can be widely used in the cosmetic and perfume industry [
