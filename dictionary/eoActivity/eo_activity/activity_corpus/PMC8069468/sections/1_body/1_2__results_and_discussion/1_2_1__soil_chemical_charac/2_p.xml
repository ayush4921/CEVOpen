<p>The soil pH values in different experimental fields ranged between 5.75 and 7.80. According to the methodology of land productivity assessment in Lithuania, the soils vary from acidic to weakly alkaline [
 <xref rid="B28-plants-10-00750" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The average pH value of the soils in all experimental fields (Aâ€“D) was 6.85. The acid/alkaline reaction of the soil solution is important for the mineralization of organic matter, solubility of the substances, intensity of microbiological processes [
