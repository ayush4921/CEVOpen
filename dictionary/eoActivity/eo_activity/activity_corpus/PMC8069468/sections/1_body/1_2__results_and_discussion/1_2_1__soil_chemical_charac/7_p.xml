<p>The total content of calcium (Ca) in soils varied from 0.336 up to 2.05%, magnesium (Mg) from 0.239 up to 0.616%, and sodium (Na) ranged from 0.334 to 0.368%. Thus, the lowest content of Ca, Mg, and Na was in the soil of experimental field D, and the highest in experimental field B. According to Jakovljevic et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-plants-10-00750" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], all mentioned alkali metals present in silicate rock-forming minerals and later are transferred into a mineral fraction of soils. Their content depends on the rate of mineral weathering and the rate of leaking of weathered products. The available forms of Ca, Mg, and Na are their exchangeable cations and various salts in the soil solution. These alkaline elements are important in plant nutrition. Ca is an essential component for root development, and Mg is important for photosynthesis. Na plays major beneficial roles in plant metabolism [
