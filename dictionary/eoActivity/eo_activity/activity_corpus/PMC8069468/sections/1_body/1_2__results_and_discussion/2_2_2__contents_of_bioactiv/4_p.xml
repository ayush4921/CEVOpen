<p>The content of extractives is the dry matter content of the extract obtained by extraction with a binary ethanolâ€“water mixture per 100 g of plant material. The concentration of extractives can be considered one of the indicators of general biological activity, since the literature contains data on the best extraction of the most biologically active substances when using binary mixtures of extractants [
