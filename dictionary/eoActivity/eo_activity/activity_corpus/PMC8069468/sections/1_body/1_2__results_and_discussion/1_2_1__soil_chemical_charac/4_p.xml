<p>According to the total nitrogen (N
 <sub>total</sub>), the arable layer of soils is divided into low nitrogen up to 0.2%, medium nitrogen up to 0.21–0.3%, adequate nitrogen up to 0.31–0.4%, and high nitrogen over 0.4% [

 <sub>total</sub> ranged from 0.13 (D) to 0.64% (C). Thus, in soils, the total nitrogen ranged from low to high. Nitrogen is needed for all plant growth processes. In the case of insufficient nitrogen content in the soil, the leaves of plants are small and light green, and begin to turn yellow, and the vegetation period of the plants is shortened [
