<p>Some of the soil chemical properties important for the growth of plants are the pH, humus, total nitrogen (N
 <sub>total</sub>), and plant-available/mobile phosphorus (P
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>5</sub>) as well as potassium (K
 <sub>2</sub>O), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and sodium (Na). These components are not only important sources of materials for building up the structures of plant tissues, but are also actively involved in the metabolic activities within plants [
