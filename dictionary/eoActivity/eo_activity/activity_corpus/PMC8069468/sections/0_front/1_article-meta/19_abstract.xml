 <p>The aim of this study was to determine the dependence of the total phenolic, flavonoid, and extractive content in extracts of 
  <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> L. on the soil pH, humus, total nitrogen (N
  <sub>total</sub>), and plant-available/mobile phosphorus (P
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>5</sub>), as well as potassium (K
  <sub>2</sub>O), total calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and sodium (Na) concentrations. Experimental fields were formed in four locations in Lithuania. Soil and perennial 
  <italic>O. vulgare</italic> samples were taken at three sites of each experimental field. A total of 12 samples of soil and 12 samples of the tested plant were collected and analyzed. The concentrations of bioactive compounds in plants are significantly (
  <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05â€“0.01) affected by some chemical properties of the soil: the total phenolic content was reliably correlated with the soil pH, N
  <sub>total</sub>, Ca, Mg, and P
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>5</sub>; the flavonoid content was correlated with the soil P
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>5</sub>, K
  <sub>2</sub>O, Mg, and Na; and the extractive content was correlated with the soil humus, N
  <sub>total</sub>, and Na. The obtained results are useful for the development of the commercial cultivation of 
  <italic>O. vulgare</italic>.
