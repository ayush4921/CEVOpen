<p>Taken together, extracellular Aβ plaque formation and intracellular accumulation of NFT are the main pathological features of AD. These structural abnormalities lead finally to neuronal death and synaptic loss which, in turn, result in violent neurobehavioral damages, mainly recent memory impairments. Oxidative agents, inflammatory factors, glutamate, or Aβ induced neurotoxicity, and cholinergic transmission deficit also promote occurrence of the diseases. Anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-neurotoxicity properties, as well as Aβ formation inhibitory and cholinergic excitatory activities of the herbal medicines are promising for the prevention and treatment of AD. As reviewed in this paper numerous herbal plants have potential therapeutic effects on AD associated symptoms. Despite abundant preclinical studies on the effectiveness of medicinal plants for neurodegenerative diseases including AD, clinical research is also required to warrant the use of herbal medicine in alleviating AD symptoms.  </p>
