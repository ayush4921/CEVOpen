<p>Salvianolic acid is another polyphenolic derivative of 
 <italic>S. miltiorrhiza</italic> that displays anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activity (
 <xref rid="B171" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>) and influences AD symptoms (
 <xref rid="B172" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B173" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>). It dose-dependently prevents self-aggregation of Aβ and further disaggregates Aβ fibrils and protects cells against Aβ fibrils neurotoxic effect (
 <xref rid="B174" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>). Zhang 
 <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated that salvianolic acid increases BDNF expression and stimulates neuronal differentiation (
 <xref rid="B175" ref-type="bibr">175</xref>). Salvianolic acid protects the PC12 cell line against neurotoxicity induced by H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and reduces lipid peroxidation and perseveres anti-oxidant enzymes, intracellular ca2+ level, and caspase-3 enzyme in the normal activity state (
 <xref rid="B176" ref-type="bibr">176</xref>). Zhang 
 <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated that salvianolic acid decreases leakage of lactate dehydrogenase and, hence, protects neuronal cells against H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> damage (
