<p>Cholinesterase enzymes that hydrolyze ACh exist in both neuronal and non-neuronal tissues; they are classified as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BchE). Overactivity of AChE and BChE reduces ACh and disrupts the cholinergic system (

It is primarily associated with glial cells and endothelial cells in the brain with a minor role in regulation of brain ACh levels (
