 <italic>Crocus sativus</italic>, a species of 
 <italic>Iridaceae</italic> family that is called saffron as well, has been widely used in traditional medicine. Anti-inflammatory (
 <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>), radical scavenging (
 <xref rid="B128" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>), and neuroprotective effects (
 <xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>) are attributed to this herbal plant. The main sources of anti-oxidant activity of saffron are phenolic and carotenoids compounds (
 <xref rid="B130" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>). Most saffron effects, in fact, belong to one of the main active phytochemical ingredients called crocin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) (
 <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>). Crocin plays multi pharmacological activities such as anti-oxidant (
 <xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>), inhibition of peroxidized lipids formation (
 <xref rid="B132" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>), SOD activity restoration (
 <xref rid="B133" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>), neuronal protection (
 <xref rid="B134" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>), and neuron morphology preservation (
 <xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>). This low stability compound is able to remove ROS powerfully (
 <xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>). Experimental evidence proves the positive effect of crocin on memory and cognition improvement (
 <xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>), as well as plasticity of synaptic transmission in the neural circuits (
 <xref rid="B139" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>), a neural mechanism involved in learning and memory phenomena. This stemless flowering plant is shown to be effective in the treatment of mild to moderate depression (
 <xref rid="B140" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>) and mental illnesses (
 <xref rid="B139" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>).
