<p>There are two main types of AD according to the age of occurrence; early-onset or familial form in the young and late-onset or sporadic form after 65 years. The early onset of AD, the autosomal dominant inherited form, is a rapid progression type of disease with shorter survival time compared to the sporadic form (

It occurs due to extracellular accumulation of the 42 amino acid peptide, called amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaque (see below), related to APP cleavage imperfection or deficit in Aβ clearance. Moreover, ε4 isoform of Apolipoprotein E (Apo E4) is another significant genetic risk factor for sporadic form of AD. Apo E4 inhibits proteolytic degradation of Aβ through neprilysin (NEP) and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) activity (
