<p>Neurofibrillary tangles are another fundamental neuropathological hallmark of AD. They are generated by hyperphosphorylation of the cytoskeletal microtubules associated protein called tau protein (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Normally, tau proteins stabilize microtubules in neuronal pathways, however, in AD patients, hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins leads to formation of paired helical NFT filaments that stimulate host neuronal cell death (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). It is revealed that AÎ² stimulates phosphorylation of tau and, therefore, provokes formation of NFT (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Formation of NFT correlates with functional impairment, cognitive decline, and neurodegeneration especially in AD (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).
