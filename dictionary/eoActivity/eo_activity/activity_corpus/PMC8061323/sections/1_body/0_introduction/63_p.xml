<p>It is shown that the ethanol extract of 
 <italic>M. officinalis</italic> has a preventive effect on Aβ accumulation in the mouse brain (
 <xref rid="B196" ref-type="bibr">196</xref>). It also inhibits the expression of BACE1 and therefore prevents Aβ production and has a hampering effect on memorial perturbation induced by Aβ plaque (
