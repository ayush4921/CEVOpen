<p>Another effective mechanism involved in AD is prion (PrPc). This cell surface glycoprotein is found in neurons especially in the spinal cord (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). The normal function of PrPc is enigmatic but it seems that the PrPc acts as an anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidant protein (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). The expression of PrPc is regulated by the amyloid intracellular domain. PrPc reduces beta-secretase (BACE1) activity and prevents overproduction of the Aβ peptide. In AD patients, this interaction is disrupted, resulting in overactivity of BACE1, which in turn, leads to extra production of Aβ peptide (
