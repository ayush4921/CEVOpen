 <italic>Magnolia officinalis</italic> is a deciduous tree with thick and brown aromatic bark and fragrant flowers used as a rich source of biologically active compounds (
 <xref rid="B186" ref-type="bibr">186</xref>). This curative herb displays some medicinal aspects including anti-inflammatory (
 <xref rid="B187" ref-type="bibr">187</xref>), anti-oxidative (
 <xref rid="B188" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>), and neuroprotective activities (
 <xref rid="B189" ref-type="bibr">189</xref>). 
 <italic>M. officinalis</italic> reduces the expression of inflammatory agents especially those stimulating NOS and inhibits activation of astrocytes and microglia (
 <xref rid="B190" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>). The multifunctional activity of 
 <italic>M. officinalis</italic> is due to some ingredients such as magnolol (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>), 4-O-methylhonokiol, honokiol, obovatol, and magnolol (
 <xref rid="B191" ref-type="bibr">191</xref>-
 <xref rid="B193" ref-type="bibr">193</xref>). It is reported that magnolia, as a major bioactive component of 
 <italic>M. officinalis</italic>, positively impacts different oxidative agents and inflammatory cytokines, including ROS, iNOS, NF-κB, TNF-α, TGF-β, IL-1β, COX2, and MAP kinases family (
 <xref rid="B191" ref-type="bibr">191</xref>). It also up-regulates some proteins effective in anti-inflammatory activities such as Ras and Raf proteins (
 <xref rid="B194" ref-type="bibr">194</xref>). Honokiol, magnolol and 4-O-methylhonokiol display some neuroprotective effects through prevention of Aβ induced cell death, reduction of ROS generation, suppression of intracellular calcium elevation, and inhibition of caspase-3 activity (
