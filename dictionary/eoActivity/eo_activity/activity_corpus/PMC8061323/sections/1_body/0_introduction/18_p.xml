<p>Oxidative stress is another mechanism through which the possibility of AD occurrence will be increased. Oxidative stressors cause damage to DNA, proteins, and other macromolecules (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). They cause mitochondrial dysfunction leading to excessive production of oxidative agents such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and free radicals, leading to neurotoxic events (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) and autophagic degradation of mitochondria in AD people (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Oxidative stress stimulates lipid peroxidation, a process that leads to formation of some reactive aldehydes like

They are known as major bioactive markers of lipid peroxidation and act as ROS. It is proven that the lipid peroxidation by-products play an important role in AD pathogenesis (
