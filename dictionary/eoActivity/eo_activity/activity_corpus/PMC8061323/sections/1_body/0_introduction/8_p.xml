<p>Extracellular accumulation of Aβ plaque is one of the main histopathological hallmarks of AD. It is normally produced in the brain and has an important role in cell signaling and synaptic plasticity (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Sequential enzymatic action on the transmembrane amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β- and γ-secretases causes Aβ generation (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). During aging, because of mutation in APP or related cleavage enzymes, including secretases and presenilin family, there is an overproduction of Aβ as well as a deficiency in its clearance, resulting in peptide aggregation and plaque formation (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Excessive amount of Aβ fibrils induces neurotoxicity and synaptotoxicity, dysfunction, and degeneration of neurons and ultimately neuronal death (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). It also induces some abnormalities in brain metabolic processes leading to neuroinflammation (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). There are several different ways including microglial and macrophage phagocytosis, transcytosis across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), autophagy, and proteolytic degradation to clear Aβ from the brain (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). The ability of some degrading enzymes such as metalloendopeptidase, NEP, and IDE in the clearance of Aβ has also been demonstrated (
