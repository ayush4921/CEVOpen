<p>It is reported that 
 <italic>M. officinalis</italic> diminishes agitation and physical non-aggressive behavior in aged people (
 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>) and modulates cognitive performance in healthy young volunteers (
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>). Soodi 
 <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated that the ethanol extract of 
 <italic>M. officinalis</italic> enhances improvement of learning and memory in the scopolamine model of dementia. They attributed this cognitive supporting action to its inhibitory effect on AChE activity (

 <italic>M. officinalis</italic> alleviates neuronal excitability and improves cognitive dysfunction in AD patients (
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>). Research indicates that through affecting the serotonergic system and ligand-gated and ion channels, 
 <italic>M. officinalis</italic> improves some symptoms in AD people (
 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>). Research proved that gallic acid, as an important constituent of 
 <italic>M. officinalis</italic>, can reduce matrix metalloproteinase-2 activity that is involved in AD (
 <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>). The medicinal plant also shows a neuroprotective effect through reduction of AÎ² induced neurotoxicity (
