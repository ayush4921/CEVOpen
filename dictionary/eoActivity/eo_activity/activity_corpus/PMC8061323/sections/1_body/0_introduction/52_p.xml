 <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated that 
 <italic>ginseng</italic> extract inhibits neuronal death and neuro-inflammation. With inhibition of hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, 
 <italic>ginseng</italic> prevents formation of the neurofibrillary tangle. Further, it is able to inhibit the BACE1 enzyme and, therefore, reduce the level of Aβ (

 <xref rid="B149" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>), a key neuromodulator in learning and memory processing. Consistently, biochemical and behavioral evaluations have demonstrated that 
 <italic>ginseng</italic> can improve stress-induced learning and memory impairment (

 <xref rid="B152" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>). Hence, it is proposed that the phytomedicine can play a distinct positive role in attenuation of memory impairment in AD (
