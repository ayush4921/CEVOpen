<p>In the level of neuronal activity, administration of aqueous extract of lavender in the Aβ injected rats restored deteriorated plasticity of hippocampal glutamatergic synaptic transmission (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Also, intracerebroventricular injection of Aβ altered hippocampal protein expression in the hippocampus (
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>). Importantly, in an 
 <italic>in vitro </italic>study using an atomic force microscope, we found that aqueous extract of lavender dose-dependently inhibits polymerization of Aβ monomer and prevents thickening of the Aβ fibrils (
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>). Further, histological assessment proved that lavender aqueous extract substantially clears brain Aβ plaques in the rat model of AD (
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>). In our previous study, using a Morris water maze task, we showed that aqueous extract of lavender improves impaired spatial learning and memory in an animal model of AD (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). A clinical trial, reported that lavender significantly reduced physical non-aggressive behaviors in patients with the dementia disorder (
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>). Metabolomic analysis of serum collected from the AD model of rats, receiving aqueous extract of lavender, showed that the extract restores metabolic profile of AD treated animals to normal status (
