 <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic>, or ginkgo, is a large tree with an angular 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_(botany)" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">crown</ext-link> and long erratic branches. This well-known traditional Chinese therapeutic herb has multi-functional effects. It has been used for thousands of years in folk medicine to treat a wide range of diseases (
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>). Several clinical investigations on AD patients validated the improving effect of 
 <italic>G. biloba</italic> on cognitive impairment and disease progression especially in the early stages (
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>-
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>). It is shown that 
 <italic>G. biloba</italic> can normalize ACh receptors in the hippocampus and stimulate the neurotransmitter activity leading to improvement of learning and memory in AD (
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>). A study showed the strong AChE inhibitory activity of 
 <italic>G. biloba</italic> (
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>). The 
 <italic>G. biloba</italic> extract protects brain cells against toxicity related to Aβ plaques (
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>) and affects some Aβ-induced events including ROS generation and accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis (
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>-
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>). Herbal medicine also inhibits free cholesterol circulation and interferes with Aβ synthesis (
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>). Consistently, research found that extract of the plant prevents 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> Aβ oligomerization and fibril formation (
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>). Some evidence indicates that 
 <italic>G. biloba</italic> can inhibit Aβ production by stimulation of the gamma-secretase pathway in the APP cleavage process (
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>). Moreover, 
 <italic>G. biloba</italic> can protect astrocytes of rat hippocampus (
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>) and displays a neuroprotective effect through regulation of tau phosphorylation, elimination of amyloid plaques (
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>), induction of growth factors synthesis, and calcium homeostasis (
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>).
