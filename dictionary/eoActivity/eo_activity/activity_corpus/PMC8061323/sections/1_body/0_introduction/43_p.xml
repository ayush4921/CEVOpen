<p>A Study by Lopez 
 <italic>et al.</italic> confirmed that the aqueous and methanol extracts of 
 <italic>M. officinalis</italic> diminish intracellular ROS generation (
 <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>). A study showed that some derivatives of 
 <italic>M. officinalis</italic> such as flavonoids, caffeic acid, and rosmaric acid have anti-oxidant properties (
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>). It is demonstrated that medicine plays a potent anti-oxidant role through decreasing MDA (
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>), increasing GSH (
 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>), and Paraoxonase 1, as critical enzymes in detoxifying oxidative stress mediators (
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>). It also displays anti-oxidant activity by scavenging free radicals, inhibiting lipid peroxidation, and protecting against H
