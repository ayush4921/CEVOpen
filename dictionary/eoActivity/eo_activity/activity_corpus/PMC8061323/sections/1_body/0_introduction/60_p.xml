<p>It is reported that tanshinone has a strong preventive activity on the AChE enzyme (
 <xref rid="B165" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>) and significantly improves the amnesic activity in behavioral examination (
 <xref rid="B181" ref-type="bibr">181</xref>). Moreover, a study showed that tanshinone restores learning and memory deficit induced by scopolamine (
 <xref rid="B182" ref-type="bibr">182</xref>). Anti-apoptotic activity of tanshinone is shown to be due to down-regulation of caspase-3 expression or up-regulation of Bcl-2 expression (
 <xref rid="B183" ref-type="bibr">183</xref>). Tanshinone can activate the Bcl-xL pathway and, thus, through that, suppresses Aβ induced apoptosis (
 <xref rid="B184" ref-type="bibr">184</xref>).
