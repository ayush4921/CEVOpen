<p>It is well seen that borneol, carvacrol, and thymol constitute the major proportion of the volatile compounds of 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic>. Indeed, in an earlier study, Jaafari et al. [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] described the EOs of 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> harvested in Tiznit region as a “borneol chemotype (59.37%),” those of Marrakech region (Asni-My Brahim) as “carvacrol (35.90%) and borneol (30%) chemotypes,” and the one of Beni Mellal region (Bin El Widane) as “borneol (51.98%) and thymol (26.81%) chemotypes,” thus showing a variation in chemotypes of the 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> EOs according to harvest zones.
