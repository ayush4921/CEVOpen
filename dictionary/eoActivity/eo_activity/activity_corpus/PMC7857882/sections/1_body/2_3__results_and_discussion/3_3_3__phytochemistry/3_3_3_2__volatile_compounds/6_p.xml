<p>A comparative study of 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> leaf and flower EOs, using simultaneous GC-FID and GC-MS tools, showed major differences regarding the main compounds of these two plants' part EOs. Thereby, borneol (a monoterpene alcohol) was the main compound of the flowers EOs with 19.3%, followed by carvacrol (10.0%) and thymol (3.8%), while carvacrol (37%), thymol (13.7%),
