<p>In addition, the antioxidant capacity of 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> extracts was also studied by many researchers. Khouya and his coworkers [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] tested the antioxidant effect of ethyl acetate, methanolic, aqueous, dichloromethane, and crude extracts of 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> aerial parts using DPPH radical scavenging, FRAP, and APPH assays and showed a higher reductive potential of these extracts than the reference compounds (Trolox). In fact, the highest reducing power of ferric metal was shown by the ethyl acetate fraction (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 82.69 ± 2.29 mmol Trolox/g of dry extract), and the lowest was observed for the aqueous fraction (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 25.46 ± 2.71 mmol Trolox/g of dry extract). The radical scavenging activity indicated that ethyl acetate fraction exerted the highest antioxidant activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.33 ± 0.02 mg/mL, followed by crude extract (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.44 ± 0.06 mg/mL), dichloromethane fraction (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.48 ± 0.05 mg/mL), and then methanolic fraction (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.71 ± 0.09 mg/mL). However, the aqueous fraction showed the weakest antiradical capacity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.85 ± 0.06 mg/mL) [
