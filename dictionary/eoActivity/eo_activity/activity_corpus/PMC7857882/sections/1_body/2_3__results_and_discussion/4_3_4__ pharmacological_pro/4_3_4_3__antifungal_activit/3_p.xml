<p>Asdadi et al. [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] studied the anticandidal activity of 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> EOs (10 
 <italic>μ</italic>l) against nosocomial fluconazole-resistant strains (
 <italic>Candida dubliniensis, C. albicans</italic>, 
 <italic>C. glabrata</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. krusei</italic>) using disc diffusion and microdilution methods, with fluconazole (10 
 <italic>μ</italic>l) and amphotericin B (10 
 <italic>μ</italic>l) as positive controls. According to this study, 
 <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic> was the most sensitive strain to the tested EOs (Ф = 85 mm), followed by 
 <italic>C. krusei</italic> (Ф = 67 mm), while 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>C. glabrata</italic> were the least sensitive fungal strains with Ф of 53 mm and 49 mm, respectively. The microdilution assays showed an interesting anticandidal effect with minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC) values ranging between 0.3300 mg/mL and 0.9062 mg/ml [
