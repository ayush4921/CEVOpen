<p>All published works about the ethnomedicinal uses, phytochemical composition, and biological activities of 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> were collected, examined, and reported in the present review. An extensive bibliometric survey from different scientific databases such as ScienceDirect, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, SpringerLink, Google Scholar, and Medline was used to extract all relevant papers. A total of 79 peer-reviewed papers published in English and French languages were selected to compose this review. The data provided in case reports, editorial/letters, patents, conference papers, and symposiums were excluded because they were considered scientifically unreliable. The search keywords used are “
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic>, phytochemical composition of 
 <italic>T. satureioides, T. satureioides</italic> EOs, biological activities of 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic>, the antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic>, ethnobotanical study of 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic>, and the antioxidant effect of 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic>”. ChemDraw Ultra 12.0 Software was used to draw the chemical structures. IUPAC names of the reported chemical compounds were cheeked using PubChem databases (
