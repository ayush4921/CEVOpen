<p>Indeed, several investigations have demonstrated that 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> exhibits numerous biological activities, including antibacterial, antifungal, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antidiabetic, and antiparasitic activities. These pharmacological effects have proven the traditional uses of 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic>. However, the evidence supporting the traditional practices such as skin disorders, hypertension, influenza, and visual ailments of modern pharmacology is still limited. In this regard, we invite research groups to conduct further studies on the antiviral, antileishmanial, and hypotensive effects of 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic>. Furthermore, the pharmacological mechanisms of action, of this plant, on molecular targets need to be explored using current experimental assessments such as network pharmacology, proteomic, and pharmacokinetic. Additionally, an appropriate pharmacological approach should be considered for providing comprehensive pharmacological information for 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic>. Moreover, 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> have shown interesting biological effects against some related oxidative stress such as inflammation and cancer. Accordingly, extensive clinical studies should be carried out to determine pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic parameters in order to develop drug from 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic>.
