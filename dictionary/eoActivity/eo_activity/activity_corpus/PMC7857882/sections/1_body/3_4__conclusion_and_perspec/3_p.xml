<p>The phytochemical analysis using different chromatographic tools such as GC-MS and HPLC revealed the presence of a plethora of bioactive compounds mainly belonging to the terpenoids class in the essential oils of 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic>. This chemical diversity varied depending on plant's part used, season's harvest, plant's origin, as well as extraction and storage conditions. However, although numerous bioactive compounds have been isolated and identified from 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> essential oils, few pure components have been assessed for their pharmacological effects. Furthermore, few studies have investigated the phenolic content of 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> extracts. Therefore, further efforts should be focused on such area in order to determine in detail the phenolic profile of this species using different extraction solvents and the current spectroscopic tools such as HPLC-DAD, infrared (IR), and 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR technique.
