<p>Significant differences were found between the antifungal activity of chitosan-agar-EO capsules of 
 <italic>C. citratus</italic> on 
 <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic> and on the application techniques of EO in poisoned food or wet chambers. With this method, 100% MIC was maintained for up to 30 days after initial dosage, which is in contrast to a 0% MIC obtained with use of other techniques. The stability of the 
 <italic>C. citratus</italic> (Chitosan-agar-EO) capsules for 45 days and a controlled effectiveness for 51 days constitute optimization in the applicability of the 
 <italic>C. citratus</italic> EO. By maximizing performance and minimizing losses in the volatilization of bioactive molecules, the integrated management of diseases associated with phytopathogenic fungi of high virulence and prevalence in vegetables grown in the dry Caribbean region of Colombia can be mitigated.
