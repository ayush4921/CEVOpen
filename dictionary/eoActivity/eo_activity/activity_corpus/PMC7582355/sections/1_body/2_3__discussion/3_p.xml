<p>Consequently, the use of EO in chitosan capsules covered with a pure agar-agar membrane was optimized, representing an easier method of implementation coupled with greater effectivity during microencapsulation [

This is beneficial since the loss of EO because of reactions with other compounds in the medium and oxidation reactions due to light or oxygen is avoided. The observed stability of the capsules elaborated in the present study is associated with several benefits. The first is the favorable structure, solubility, and gelation of the agar-agar, which is a complex mixture of polysaccharides composed of agarose and agaropectin polymers, which make it an excellent encapsulant due to their solubility properties. This material is tolerant to rainfall and maintains its stability at temperatures below 50 °C. The second benefit is that chitosan is a primarily hydrophobic linear copolymer with a rigid structure that is insoluble in water or in organic solvents and that has low solubility in contact with basic substances. Other characteristics that make it water resistant are the distribution of acetyl groups along the macromolecular chain, the concentration of the polysaccharide, and the ionic strength [

The third benefit is that under the edaphoclimatic conditions of the vegetable producing areas in the dry Caribbean region of Colombia near Serranía del Perijá and the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta the possibility of accelerated deterioration of the capsules is reduced due to the predominance of slightly acidic and neutral soils (Vertisols, Entisols, Aridisols, and Fluvents). Additionally, due to the short and well-concentrated periods of rainfall during four months of the year, compared to other regions of Colombia, implementation is easier. This allowed the capsules to maintain their durability during periods of minimal precipitation in arid zones [
