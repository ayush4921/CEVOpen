<p>The chitosan used to make the capsules showed no biocontrol effect on the pathogen evaluated. The non-significant inhibition by chitosan when used individually against 
 <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic> as well as its antimicrobial activity referred to in this study depends on both the surface characteristics of the pathogen cells and the characteristics of the chitosan. Depending on the process and the conditions for obtaining chitosan, it acquires a greater or lesser degree of deacetylation (DD) and positive load density (PLD). With a DD of 97.5%, PLD increases, which also increases antimicrobial activity [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-04447" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The chitosan selected for this study had a lower degree of deacetylation, so it did not act as an antimicrobial agent but only as an encapsulating agent. This facilitated the analysis of the results of the antimicrobial activity of the EO obtained from 
 <italic>Cymbopogon citratus</italic>. Other studies conducted by Gutiérrez-Martínez [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-25-04447" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] report an inhibition of 80% to 100% on isolates of 
 <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> sp using the polymer at 1%, molecular weight of 1.74 × 10
 <sup>4</sup>, and a deacetylation of 75–85%.
