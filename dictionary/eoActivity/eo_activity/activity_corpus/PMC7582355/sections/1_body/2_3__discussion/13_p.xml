<p>Although 
 <italic>Trichoderma</italic> sp. can be an efficient way to control 
 <italic>Colletotrichum gloesporioides</italic> [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-04447" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], its effectiveness, like that of other bio-inputs such as 
 <italic>Beauveria bassiana</italic>, depends on environmental conditions. In especially arid areas, such as the Colombian dry Caribbean, high radiation and low relative humidity can limit the sporulation of biocontrollers [

 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-04447" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Therefore, it is especially important to continue field evaluations of the chitosan capsules proposed in this study and verify whether the use of a biopolymer with fungistatic activity can act synergistically with EO. Future studies should include not only the effect on crop health, but also the effect on promoting plant development and pepper yield, as has been evidenced in other horticultural crops [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-04447" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Likewise, the results of this study suggest the relevance of continuing with studies for the standardized production of 
 <italic>C. citratus</italic> oil in chitosan-agar capsules and testing both in greenhouses and in open fields. The capsulesâ€™ cytotoxicity, phytotoxicity, socioeconomic impact, and environmental impact in the management of anthracnose associated with 
 <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic> in sweet pepper should be studied further.
