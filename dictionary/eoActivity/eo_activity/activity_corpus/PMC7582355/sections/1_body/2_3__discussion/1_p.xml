<p>Samples taken from sweet pepper cv Topito plants with symptoms of 
 <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic> and with 100% mortality of inoculated seedlings in vitro confirmed that the pathogen is present in the dry Caribbean region of Colombia. As the causative agent of anthracnose in 
 <italic>Capsicum annuum</italic>, the pathogen presents a serious threat to its horticultural production in the tropical and subtropical regions where this vegetable is grown, causing necrotic lesions and limiting its quality and possible commercialization. Severe pathogen attacks result in production losses that are greater than 80% [

 <italic>C. gloeosporioides.</italic> Additionally, it is important that the tests developed in vitro are carried out using highly virulent strains as was the case of this research study. Likewise, isolation from the area being studied helps to increase the margin of reliability in the results obtained with the use of the EO application technique.
