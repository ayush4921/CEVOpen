<p>Chitosan capsules showed a more effective means of applying EO than using the poisoned food and wet chamber techniques. However, there is a special interest in the development of bio-inputs and the use of nanoemulsions of different EOs such as 
 <italic>Azadirachta indica, Meliaceae</italic> and 
 <italic>Cymbopogon nardus, Poaceae</italic>. Both were successfully tested in in vitro conditions by means of the poisoned food technique for the control of phytopathogenic fungi of economic importance in horticulture like 
 <italic>Rhizoctonia solani, Ceratobasidiaceae</italic> and 
 <italic>Sclerotium rolfsii, Atheliaceae</italic>. The nanoemulsion of EO of 
 <italic>C. nardus</italic> demonstrated a better control over 
 <italic>R. solani</italic> (ED50 13.67 mg L

At the in vitro level, the process of reinoculation of the pathogen after 30 days demonstrated 100% inhibition, confirming the effectiveness of the use of a chitosan polymer matrix combined with a solidifying agar-agar matrix. This study presents the first report on the effectiveness of the agar-agar-chitosan complex in forming an encapsulation complex for the active components of the 
 <italic>C. citratus</italic> EO as well as its subsequent controlled release.
