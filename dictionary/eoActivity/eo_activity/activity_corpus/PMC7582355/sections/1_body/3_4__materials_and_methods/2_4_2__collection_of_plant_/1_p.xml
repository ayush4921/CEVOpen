<p>The plant material was harvested manually in the rainy season from crops without the use of agrochemicals. The plants grew in moderately acidic soil with 2% organic matter in the indigenous community of Atanquez, Colombia, and were located 1200 m above sea level (10°42′15″ N, 73°17′18″ W). This community is home to the ASOPROKAN association, which is made up of agroecological producers from the indigenous community of the Kankuamos. The essential oil of

A phytochemical evaluation was performed using gas chromatography with subsequent gas characterization/mass spectrometry (GCMS-TQ8050 NX Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) using a selective detector. Presumptive identification was performed using Apolar DB-5MS (60 m) and Polar DB-WAX (60 m) columns and compared with information from the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) in Gaithersburg, MD, USA, and the MassLab program (Porto, Portugal).
