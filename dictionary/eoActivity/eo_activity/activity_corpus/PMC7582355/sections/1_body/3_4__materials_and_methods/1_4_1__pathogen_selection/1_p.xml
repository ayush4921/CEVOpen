<p>The study was conducted utilizing the facilities of the Universidad Popular del Cesar (UPC) located in Cesar, Colombia (10°18′ N and 73°24′ O). Sweet pepper seedlings (
 <italic>Capsicum annuum</italic>—
 <italic>Solanaceae</italic>) from the traditional cultivar cv. Topito were utilized for the experiments. It should be noted that this pepper is a local variety and is sweet as opposed to hot like the chili pepper variety (
 <italic>Capsicum chinense</italic>—
 <italic>Solanaceae</italic>) of the same name. The plants were between 2 and 6 months old and were planted at the UPC experimental farm in Valledupar, Colombia. The farm was located at an altitude of 169 m above sea level, with an average annual temperature of 28.4 ± 5.4 °C, an average annual relative humidity of 65 ± 9%, and 961 mm of average annual precipitation. The pathogen 
 <italic>Colletotrichum gloeosporioides</italic> (
 <italic>Glomerellaceae</italic>) was isolated from the leaves and peppers of the sweet pepper plants cv. Topito following the protocol used by Melo [

 <sup>6</sup> CFU mL
 <sup>−1</sup> in sterile distilled water [

 <xref rid="B36-molecules-25-04447" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Molecular analyses were performed in the laboratories of the Corporación para Investigaciones Biológicas-CIB in Medellín, Colombia. DNA extraction was performed using the hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method. Amplification of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) was performed using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique with universal primers TS1 and ITS4. The reactions were incubated at 95 °C for five minutes, then 30 cycles were performed at 94 °C for one minute (denaturation), at 55 °C for one minute (alignment), at 72 °C for one minute and a half (extension); then, a cycle of 72 °C for five minutes (final extension) and a final cycle for an indefinite time at 8 °C were performed.
