<p>Chitosan capsules were made by using the modified chitosan-agar technique described by Jovanović [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-25-04447" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Chitosan was cross-linked with agar-agar in order to encapsulate the EO. A 6 mL solution of chitosan in 2% acetic acid was prepared in an orbital shaker for 12 h. This solution was mixed with 3 mL of agar-agar and 3.6 mL of EO and agitated until homogenized. Eighty-five µL was then poured into each of the 120 microplate cavities which served as molds for the capsules and cooled for 12 h. The filling of the microplate was repeated until 668 capsules were made. The selection of the proportion of the components of the capsule was carried out from a previous test in which different proportions were tested until they reached a firm consistency after a week under ambient conditions (Available online as
