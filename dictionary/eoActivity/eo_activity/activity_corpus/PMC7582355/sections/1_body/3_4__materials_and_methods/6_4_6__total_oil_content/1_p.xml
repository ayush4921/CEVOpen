<p>To evaluate the total oil content or ether extract, the quantitative method of total fat by acid hydrolysis described in the Official Method AOAC 922.06 [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-25-04447" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] was used as a reference. Approximately 1 g of each sample was weighed in 50 mL beakers to which 1 mL of ethyl alcohol and 5 mL of hydrochloric acid were added. The solution was then mixed and placed in a water bath for 40 min. Then 5 mL of alcohol was added, and each sample was allowed to cool. Each treatment was transferred to 15 mL test tubes, and 4 washes with ethyl ether and petroleum ether were carried out in previously weighed glassware where the solvent was allowed to evaporate for approximately 1 h and placed into an oven at 100 Â°C for 1 h.
