<p>Antifungal activity was determined by measuring the MIC in relation to the incidence and severity of infection in the plants. Taking into consideration the effect of environmental conditions on the capsules, and based on the MIC found in the laboratory, the use of 255 µL of EO distributed in 30 capsules allowed the fungus to be inoculated with a spore concentration of 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> conidia mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, which had previously been used under in vitro conditions. These spores were applied on the leaves of Topito pepper plants, whose average height was 50 cm. The capsules were located on the substrate and at the base of the stems. Treatments with 170 µL (20 capsules), 255 µL (30 capsules), and 340 µL (40 capsules) of 
 <italic>C. citratus</italic> EO and their corresponding controls with corn oil were performed. The experimental unit consisted of a plant planted in 5 Kg potters and capsule control using corn oil. The MIC was determined from the daily review of the experiment until the appearance of an infection was seen.
