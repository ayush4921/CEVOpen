<p>The in vitro efficiency of chitosan and EO capsules was measured by comparing them with the two alternative techniques of EO application. With the PDA agar as a growth medium, these corresponded to the following treatments: PDA + 1500 ppm EO (poisoned food technique described by Melo [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-25-04447" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]), wet chamber EO (technique described by Reyes-Chaparro [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-25-04447" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]) in Petri dishes with agar and with one 2 cm paper disk impregnated with 60 µL of EO fastened with paper tape on the inside of the lid, chitosan capsules with EO (modified technique by Jovanović [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-25-04447" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]), and two control treatments, one negative with PDA and one positive using the

 <xref rid="B44-molecules-25-04447" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The treatments to determine the efficiency of chitosan were (P0) EO capsules + PDA, (P1) Poisoned Food Technique corresponding to the effect of contact using PDA + EO, (P2) Wet Chamber Technique using impregnated disks with EO, (P3) Capsule Technique (Chitosan-Agar-EO), and (P4) Antagonism Technique
