<p>For P0, P1, P2, and P4, a 5 mm diameter portion of PDA was inoculated on which 
 <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic> had grown. P3 utilized 1 mL of a solution of 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> conidia mL
 <sup>−1</sup> spread over the surface of the PDA. All trials were performed with 3 experimental treatments and 3 control treatments. All processes were incubated at room temperature; measurements were taken every 24 h for 7 days, with measurements of the diameter of the colonies measured at 2, 5, and 7 days. The measurements were expressed as a percentage of inhibition of mycelial growth (IMG) with the following formula: IMG (%) = [(gd − dt)/dt] × 100, where gd= is the growth diameter of the control mycelium and dt= is the diameter mycelium growth with EO. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the oil was the lowest concentration of the oil that gave 100% inhibition in mycelial growth [
