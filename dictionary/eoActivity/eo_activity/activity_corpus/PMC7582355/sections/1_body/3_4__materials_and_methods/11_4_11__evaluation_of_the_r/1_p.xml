<p>The evaluation of environmental conditions was carried out using the methodology described by Males [

 <xref rid="molecules-25-04447-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Nine (Chitosan-Agar-EO) capsules were selected and placed on the soil surface of three Topito pepper plants, and this was repeated three times. This was carried out in February, July, and October in order to measure these results against the environmental conditions that presented greater values in their variables. Measurements were taken every 5 days and took into account the firmness and weight of the capsules until dry or until a weight loss of greater than 90% was recorded.
