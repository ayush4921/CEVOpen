<p>Every chitosan-agar-EO treatment of 
 <italic>C. citratus</italic> showed significant differences in the percentage of inhibition of the mycelial growth of 
 <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic> after 72 h of incubation. The control treatments using corn oil resulted in no inhibition of the mycelial growth of the pathogen. However, treatments with 913, 1056, and 1156 ppm of 
 <italic>C. citratus</italic> EO, corresponding to 20 capsules in each of the three systems, were less efficient in controlling the pathogen since they showed inhibitions below 80% with 43%, 49.7%, and 53.9% inhibition of mycelial growth, respectively. The treatment with 1370 ppm in chitosan-agar-EO capsules of 
 <italic>C. citratus</italic> showed the minimum inhibitory concentration in vitro with 100% growth inhibition of 
 <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic>.
