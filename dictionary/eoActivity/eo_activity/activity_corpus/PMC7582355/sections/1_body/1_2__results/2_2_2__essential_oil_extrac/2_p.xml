<p>GC-FID analysis showed that the lemongrass oil used was dominated by oxygenated monoterpenes. Geranial and neral are the isomers of citral, with geranial representing the trans-isomer and neral representing the cis isomer. The retention times of the resulting three main peaks were 2.46, 13.39, and 13.96 min for myrcene, neral, and geranial, respectively. The first peak represented myrcene, the second peak represented neral, and the third peak represented geranial (
