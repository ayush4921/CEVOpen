<p>From samples of sweet pepper cv Topito plants (
 <italic>Capsicum annuum</italic>—Solanaceae) with anthracnose symptoms, the pathogen 
 <italic>Colletotrichum gloeosporioides</italic> was isolated. It grew into a characteristic colony with gray-white mycelium and straight, cylindrical, hyaline, and obtuse conidia in the apex, coinciding with the description reported by Ogawa [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-25-04447" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This was also confirmed through molecular analysis, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04447-f001">Figure 1</xref>. Additionally, the reactivation of the phytopathogen in the “agar-sweet pepper” was achieved with a count higher than the inoculated 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> Colony Forming Units. This concentration was evaluated in relation to its virulence and a 100% mortality rate was obtained in inoculated seedlings. The seedlings showed wilting and mycelium growth in the peppers and leaves when incubated in a wet chamber.
