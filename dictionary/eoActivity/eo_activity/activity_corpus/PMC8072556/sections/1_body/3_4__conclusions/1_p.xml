<p>Plant extracts and oils provide complementary ways of managing pests and diseases especially in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to the adverse effects of synthetic insecticides on the environment and human health, it is necessary to develop alternative control strategies to reduce the use of insecticides. In the present study, for the first time, we investigated the leaf essential oil of 
 <italic>Ma</italic>
 <italic>gnolia citrata</italic> from Vietnam and its biological activity against two major insect pests of agricultural, medical and veterinary importance. Although MCEO exhibited weak toxicity against 1st instar larvae and adult female 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, the oil showed a moderately strong attraction to sterile male medfly 
 <italic>C. capitata</italic> as compared to a known strong attractant for medfly, tea tree oil (
 <italic>Melaleuca alternifolia</italic>). The oxygenated monoterpenes dominated in the MCEO and aliphatic aldehydes represented over three-quarters of the total composition. The presence of aliphatic aldehydes in high concentration might reduce the captures of medflies. However, additional experiments may be required to determine whether aliphatic compounds are responsible for the moderate activity and whether the combination of MCEO with other plant essential oils, or essential oil components, can enhance the effectiveness of sterile male of 
 <italic>C. capitata</italic>. In addition, combination blends should be tested in the field to ensure their efficacy.
