<p>The extensive and long-term application of pesticides has resulted in an accumulation of residues in food, water, soil, and other environmental components. The negative impact of pesticides on biodiversity, and increasing pesticide resistance, have prompted more research on alternative control strategies using botanicals, biological, cultural, and other sustainable methods for integrated management of existing and invasive pests [

Vietnam is a tropical Asian country with extraordinarily rich plant biodiversity, and many of the indigenous plants are known to have medicinal properties; the countryâ€™s rich forest ecosystems provide an abundant opportunity to search for phytochemicals with potential applications for the management of major insect pest species [

 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> L. (Diptera: Culicidae) mosquitoes are the major vector for the transmission of several uncontrolled, life-threatening viral diseases, which are more frequent in hot and humid climate regions [

 <xref rid="B14-molecules-26-02311" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and thus effective mosquito control of both larval and adult stages can reduce the impact of vector-borne diseases. As an economically important agricultural pest, the Mediterranean fruit fly, 
 <italic>Ceratitis capitata</italic> (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Tephritidae), is one of the most serious invasive pests in tropical and subtropical regions around the world [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-26-02311" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It attacks a wide range of fruits and vegetables, with larval infestation causing severe damage to many commercially important tropical and subtropical crops [

 <xref rid="B17-molecules-26-02311" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Thus, identification of effective attractants for early detection and suppression of 
 <italic>C. capitata</italic> populations is critical for managing this pest and reducing crop losses.
