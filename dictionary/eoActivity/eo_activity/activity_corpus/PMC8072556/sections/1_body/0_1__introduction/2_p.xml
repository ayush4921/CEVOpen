<p>The genus 
 <italic>Magnolia</italic> L. (Magnoliaceae) is one of the oldest families of flowering plants [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-02311" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The genus comprises about 245 taxa occurring in temperate and tropical areas of Southeast and East Asia, North America, the Antilles, and Central and South America [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-26-02311" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. 
 <italic>Magnolia</italic> species have attracted a great deal of research interest due to the presence of biphenolic phytochemicals magnolol and honokiol, which possess diverse pharmacological properties, including inhibition of the central nervous system, prevention of cardiovascular disease, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antioxidative, and free radical scavenging activity [

 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-02311" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. 
 <italic>Magnolia</italic> extracts and their bioactive chemicals have been evaluated for their promising insecticidal activity. A lignan, epimagnoline A, was isolated from flower buds of 
 <italic>M. fargesii</italic> (Finet and Gagnep.) [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-02311" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Larvicidal activity of different solvent extracts of 
 <italic>M. salicifolia</italic> Maxim. showed good to moderate effect on fourth instar larvae of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-02311" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Essential oils from 
 <italic>M. grandiflora</italic> L. were tested for insecticidal and biting deterrent activity against 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti,</italic> and the seed oil exhibited biting deterrence similar to the standard insect repellent DEET (
 <italic>N</italic>,
 <italic>N</italic>-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide) [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-26-02311" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Tests for insecticidal susceptibility to ethanol extracts from

 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-02311" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and 
 <italic>M. schiedeana</italic> Schltl. were carried out against the tephritid fruit fly 
 <italic>Anastrepha ludens</italic> (Loew) [

 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>dealbata</italic> [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-02311" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], as well as the seed and sarcotesta extracts from 
 <italic>M. schiedeana,</italic> showed potential insecticidal activity against adults of

 <italic>gnolia citrata</italic> Noot and Chalermglin is an evergreen tree (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02311-f001">Figure 1</xref>) that grows naturally in three localities in Thailand and at one locality in Vietnam [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-26-02311" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,

 <xref rid="B30-molecules-26-02311" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Leaves are locally known as Giổi chanh’ due to strong citrus or lemongrass odor and used as spices in traditional food preparations by the people of Ha Giang [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-26-02311" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In a search for biorational insecticidal agents from natural sources that could be useful in future pest management strategies, we (i) isolated 
 <italic>M. citrata</italic> essential oil (MCEO) from leaves, (ii) identified the chemical content of MCEO, (iii) evaluated MCEO for potential insecticidal activity against larval and adult 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, and (iv) assayed MCEO for potential attraction of sterile male 
 <italic>C. capitata</italic>. This study represents the first investigation of MCEO for insecticidal and attractant properties.
