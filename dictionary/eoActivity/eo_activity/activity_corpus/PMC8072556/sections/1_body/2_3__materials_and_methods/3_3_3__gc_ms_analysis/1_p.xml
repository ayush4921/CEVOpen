<p>The MCEO was diluted in methylene chloride in a 1:1000 ratio for analysis by GC-MS using an Agilent 5975B (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) system equipped with a DB5-MS column (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The carrier gas was helium, with a flow rate of 1.3 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup>. GC oven temperature was kept at 45 °C for 1 min and increased to 94 °C at a rate of 4 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup>, then increased to 180 °C at a rate of 2 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup>. The PTV injector temperature was 200 °C. Mass spectra were recorded at 70 eV. Mass range was
