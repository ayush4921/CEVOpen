<p>The harvested leaves (900 g) were subject to hydrodistillation using a Clevenger apparatus (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) for 3 h. The slightly yellow oil was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate to remove any trace of water and stored in sealed glass vials at 4 Â°C until further analysis.
