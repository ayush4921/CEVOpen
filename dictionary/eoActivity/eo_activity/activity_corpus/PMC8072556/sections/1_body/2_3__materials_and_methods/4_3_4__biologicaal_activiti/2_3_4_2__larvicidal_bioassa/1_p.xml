<p>Larvicidal activity was assayed against 1st instar 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (ORL strain) as described previously [

 <xref rid="B52-molecules-26-02311" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Briefly, the MCEO was diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Cas# 67-68-5, Sigma-Aldrich Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA) to make 100 μg/μL and assayed in four different concentrations (1.0, 0.5, 0.25, and 0.1 μg/μL) in a final volume of 200 μL of larval rearing media into 96-well plates. Mortality was recorded after 24 h of exposure. Larva were considered dead if they did not move during observation or after swirling the contents of the well. Three replicates were conducted on consecutive days. Technical-grade permethrin (Chem Service, West Chester, PA, USA) was used as a positive control at 31 pg/μL, and DMSO was used as the negative control in all assays.
