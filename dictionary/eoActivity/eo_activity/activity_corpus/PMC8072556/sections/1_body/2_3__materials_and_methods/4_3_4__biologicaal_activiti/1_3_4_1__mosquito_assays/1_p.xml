<p>Two strains of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> were used for bioassays: Orlando 1952 strain (ORL) and Puerto Rico strain (PR). Mosquitoes were reared following standard procedures at the USDA-ARS Center for Medical, Agricultural, and Veterinary Entomology (CMAVE) in Gainesville, FL, USA [

 <xref rid="B52-molecules-26-02311" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Since pyrethroid resistance is common in
