<p>Females of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (ORL and PR strains), 3–6 days post-emergence, were used in toxicity assays as described earlier [

 <xref rid="B51-molecules-26-02311" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,

 <xref rid="B53-molecules-26-02311" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Mosquitoes were briefly anesthetized at 4 °C and then sorted by sex. Females were used for all replicate tests. Compounds were diluted from a 100 μg/μL stock in DMSO into a 10 μg/μL working stock in acetone. A 0.5 μL droplet of each working stock was applied to individual mosquitoes (15–20 per dose). A negative control of acetone (Cas # 67-64-1, Sigma-Aldrich Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA) and positive control of permethrin (0.69 ng/μL) (Chem Service, West Chester, PA, USA) near the LD
 <sub>50</sub> of the ORL1952 strain was included in each assay. Mortality was scored at 24 h after application, and data were corrected for background mortality with Abbott’s correction if mortality in controls was between 10–20%. Three replicates of the standard adult topical screening bioassay were conducted with 20 female mosquitoes at each dose.
