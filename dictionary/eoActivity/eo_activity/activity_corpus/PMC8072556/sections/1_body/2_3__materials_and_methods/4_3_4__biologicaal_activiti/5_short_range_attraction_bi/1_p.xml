<p>Laboratory bioassays were conducted using methods similar to those reported previously [

 <xref rid="B47-molecules-26-02311" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Tests were performed using small screen cages (20.3 × 20.3 × 20.3 cm) into which 50 flies were introduced 1 h before the start of an experiment. Experiments were initiated by introducing a Petri dish (53 mm diameter 12 mm height) containing essential oil samples applied to a filter paper disk (Whatman #1, 3.5 cm diameter). Each sample consisted of 10 µL of a 10% dilution in acetone. To determine relative attraction to MCEO, bioassays were performed with several control essential oils for comparison. Treatments consisted of MCEO, TTO (tea tree oil, derived from

 <xref rid="B45-molecules-26-02311" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]). TTO and TREO are known to be strong attractants of male

Tests were run for 30 min; results were recorded initially as the number of flies within a Petri dish, which was then converted to percentage of flies attracted. Tests were replicated five times, and the results were analyzed by ANOVA followed by mean separation with Tukey test (
