<p>MCEO demonstrated 100% mortality at 1 μg/μL (1000 ppm) against 1st instar larvae while the activity dropped quickly at lower concentrations. Previous studies of larvicidal activity of dominant compounds in MCEO were investigated against 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> larvae, and they exhibited good to moderate activity. For example, the larvicidal activity of citral, which contains geranial and neral, showed 100% mortality at 100 ppm in 24 h against 4th instar 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> [

 <xref rid="B38-molecules-26-02311" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] reported that linalool displayed 100% mortality at 200 ppm in 24 h post-treatment against 4th instar larvae of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>. Waliwitiya et al. [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-02311" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] have also reported that citronellal exhibited larvicidal activity against all four larval stages of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (LC
 <sub>50</sub> values 10.3–40.8 mg/L). Cheng et al. [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-26-02311" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] found that sabinene had larvicidal activity at LC
 <sub>50</sub> of 74.1 mg/mL against fourth-instar larvae after 24 h treatment. MCEO is not considered suitable for further evaluation due to its weak activity in both assays, which is below our laboratory thresholds of required larvicidal activity greater than 80% at 0.1 μg/μL and/or &gt;80% mortality in adult topical assays. However, plant extracts are often considered less harmful to the environment and are perceived as more natural. These natural products represent possible alternatives to current control methods. Previous studies by our research group revealed that the PR strain of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> was highly resistant to permethrin compared with the ORL strain in topical adult assays [

 <xref rid="B42-molecules-26-02311" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Norris et al. [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-26-02311" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] highlighted that plant essential oils could complement or synergize pyrethroids. Future work with combinations of pyrethroids and plant essential oils needs to be done to determine the viability of use in integrated pest management strategies. Therefore, plant oils might offer potential alternatives to reduce resistance in mosquito populations.
