<p>In short-range attraction bioassays with male

 <italic>Tetradenia riparia</italic> essential oil), a strong attractant [

 <xref rid="B47-molecules-26-02311" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. However, attraction to MCEO was significantly greater than that observed with MGEO (mastic gum essential oil), a weak attractant [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-26-02311" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and significantly less than that observed with TTO, the best essential oil attractant identified to date [
