<p>Initial larval activity testing MCEO against 1st instar 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (Orlando, ORL strain, insecticide-susceptible) showed 100%, 40%, 20%, and 0% mortality at the concentration of 1.0, 0.5, 0.25, and 0.1 μg/μL, respectively, while positive control permethrin had 100% mortality at 31 pg/μL and solvent control (DMSO) showed 0% mortality. In adult topical bioassays, MCEO was tested against female 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (ORL and Puerto Rico (PR) strain (pyrethroid-resistant)) and the oil demonstrated 53.89% (±23.35) and 67.65% (±17.74) mortality at 5 μg/mosquito, respectively. Permethrin showed 60% (±20) mortality of the ORL and 10% (±10) mortality against the PR strain at 0.69 ng/μL. Control mortality of solvent (acetone) was 0%.
