<p>Previous chemical analyses indicated that the major components in the highly attractive TTO consisted of terpinen-4-ol (41.8%), γ-terpinene (15.5%), 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (11.9%), α-terpineol (5.0%), α-terpinene (3.9%), 1,8-cineole (3.5%), α-pinene (2.9%), and terpinolene (2.8%) [

 <italic>tau</italic>-cadinol (7%) [

The current study reports the major constituents of MCEO as linalool (19%), geranial (16%), citronellal (14%), neral (14%), and sabinene (12%). Since none of these attractive essential oils have major chemical components in common, it is highly likely that a combination of these oils may result in additive or synergistic attraction of male
