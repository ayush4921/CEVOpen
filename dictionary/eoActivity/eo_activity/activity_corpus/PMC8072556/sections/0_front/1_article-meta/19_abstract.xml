 <p>In this study, 
  <italic>Magnolia citrata</italic> Noot and Chalermglin (Magnoliaceae) essential oil (MCEO) was evaluated for insecticidal activity against the yellow fever mosquito 
  <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and attractant activity for the Mediterranean fruit fly 
  <italic>Ceratitis capitata</italic>. The leaves of 
  <italic>Magnolia citrata</italic> (Giổi chanh) were collected from northwestern Vietnam, and the water-distilled MCEO was analyzed by gas-chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The major constituents of MCEO were identified as linalool 19%, geranial 16%, citronellal 14%, neral 14%, and sabinene 12%. MCEO showed 100% mortality at 1 μg/μL against 1st instar larvae of 
  <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (Orlando strain, ORL), and the oil exhibited 54% (ORL) and 68% (Puerto Rico strain) mortality at 5 μg/mosquito against 
  <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> adult females. Initial screens showed that MCEO had weak insecticidal activity compared to the positive control permethrin. In bioassays with sterile male 
  <italic>C. capitata</italic>, MCEO exhibited moderately strong attraction, comparable to that observed with a positive control, 
  <italic>Tetradenia riparia</italic> essential oil (TREO). Herein, the insecticidal and attractant activities of MCEO are reported for the first time.
