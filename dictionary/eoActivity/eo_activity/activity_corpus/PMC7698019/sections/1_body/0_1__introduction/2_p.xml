<p>The mechanism of extraction of the essential oils by the ultrasound process is based on two main physical phenomena such as the diffusion across the cell walls and membranes and mechanical destruction of plant cell walls by pressure waves and cavitation, and next, rinsing the contents of cells [

 <xref rid="B2-molecules-25-05322" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Due to the shortening of the exposure time of the raw material to high temperatures, this process avoids the disadvantages of essential oil conventional extraction, such as the formation of the by-product by decomposition of thermolabile and heat-sensitive compounds [
