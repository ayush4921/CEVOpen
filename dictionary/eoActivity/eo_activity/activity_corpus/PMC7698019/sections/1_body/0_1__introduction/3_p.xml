<p>The objective of this study was to improve the yield of the essential oil extraction using distillation assisted by sonication of raw material. There is no information in the literature about the effect of sonication of celery seeds (
 <italic>Apium graveolens</italic> L., 
 <italic>Apiaceae</italic> Lindl.) on the hydrodistillation of essential oil as well as the obtained product quality. The only research on ultrasound-assisted extraction was conducted by Zor et al. (2017), which was proved as a fast and efficient method for deriving alcoholic extracts from celery seeds, a rich source of antioxidants [

 <xref rid="B5-molecules-25-05322" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Due to antioxidant activities and antimicrobial effects against bacteria, yeast, and moulds, the celery seed oil may be used as alternative natural food preservatives, functional foods, and nutraceutical ingredient [
