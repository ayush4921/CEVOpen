<p>Radical scavenging activity was examined using the DPPH assay. First, the 1-μM DPPH (Sigma-Aldrich, Hamburg, Germany) solution in methanol (pure p.a., Chempur, Poland) was prepared. Next, the 200 μL of DPPH was added to 100 μL of the solution of essential oil in methanol at concentrations of 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 g/L, respectively. The analysis was performed using a 96-well polystyrene plate (Nest Biotechnology, Wuxi, China). The samples were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. As the reference, a methanol solution of Trolox ((±)-6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchromane-2-carboxylic acid, Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) was used. The absorbance of the DPPH radical was spectrophotometrically analyzed at a wavelength of 517 nm (Modular Multimode Microplate Reader TriStar
 <sup>2</sup> S, Berthold Technologies, Oak Ridge, TN, USA). The results were shown as the percentage of inhibition of the DPPH radicals calculated according to the formula:
