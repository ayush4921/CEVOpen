<p>Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses were carried out using a Trace GC Ultra gas chromatograph and a DSQ II mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron Corporation, Beverly, MA, USA) with an Rtx-1 column (length 60 m, internal diameter 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 mm, Restek Corporation, Bellefonte, PA, USA). A flow divider (an MS-Column Flow Splitter, SGE Analytical Science, Melrose Park, Australia) collected of signals concurrently from two detectors (FID, MSD, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The split ratio was 1:20. The temperature program was from 50 °C (3 min) to 300 °C (30 min), at a gradient of 48 °C (21 min). The temperature of the injector (SSL) and detector (FID) was 280 °C and 300 °C, respectively. The helium flowing at a constant pressure of 200 kPa was used as the carrier gas. The mass spectrometer ionization energy was 70 eV, and the ion source temperature was 200 °C. A full scan was conducted in the mass range from 33 to 420. The analysis was repeated three times. The NIST Library, Wiley 8th edition, and the Adams 4th edition were used.</p>
