<p>The extraction of essential oils was performed by the hydrodistillation process with the use of a modified Deryng apparatus [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-05322" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The 1000 mL of distilled water per 100 g of celery seeds was used. The control sample constituted the essential oil from untreated celery seeds (without ultrasound processes). The yield of essential oil was calculated as an average of three hydrodistillation processes. The percentage increase of yield of essential oil was calculated according to the formula:
