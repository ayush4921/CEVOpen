<p>Initially, the point of inflection on the curve was not obtained in the graph of Eta versus time of sonication (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05322-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Thus, additional experiments for sonication time (50, 70, and 90 min) under optimum conditions of other parameters were performed. The hydrodistillation efficiency was 2.15 ± 0.032, 2.07 ± 0.06, and 2.04 ± 0.06 g/100 g of seeds, respectively. It was considered that the optimal time of the sonication process was 50 min, due to the lack of significant performance improvement as well as economic and ecological considerations. The optimum conditions for celery seeds pre-treated with the use of ultrasounds were as follows: sonication time 50 min, pulse range 0.5, power control amplitude 60%, and content of water 700 mL (
