The experimental yield of essential oil from celery seeds sonicated under optimum conditions equalled 2.15 Â± 0.032 g/100 g of seeds. The efficiency increased by 48.3%. The increased efficiency of ultrasound-assisted hydrodistillation results from the specifics of the action of ultrasound [

The results of this action are the better circulation of extraction solvent, more effective eluting of cell content, and thus more efficient usage of the biological potential of raw material. Another advantage is that sonication accelerates the water absorption leading to faster swelling of the plant material and increasing pore size in the cell walls, and thus facilitates the mass transfer.
