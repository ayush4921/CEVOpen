<p>Statistical analysis consisting of comparing (correlating) individual spectra and determining the correlation coefficient between near-infrared (NIR) spectra of essential oil from celery seeds with and without ultrasounds pre-treatment was performed. The correlation coefficient was 97.8%, which indicates high similarity. The high similarity was also confirmed in the mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy analysis, where the specific locations of the bands were identical for both essential oils. According to the Mannâ€“Whitney test with a significant level of 0.05, the amounts of sedanenolide in essential oil obtained by the hydrodistillation as well as from sonicated celery seeds were statistically significantly different [
