Effective antimicrobial medicines are essential for conducting surgical procedures and many other health care practices. Many of these antimicrobial medicines are also used in livestock farming and for many non-life threatening conditions, thereby increasing exposure of bacteria to antibiotics increasing the chances for the development of antimicrobial resistance over time. In human healthcare, many people use antibiotics to treat viral infections or other conditions which would naturally resolve over time, which also increases the development of AMR.</p><p id="par0010">The WHO and other organisations are developing action plans to counter the growing antimicrobial resistance problem [<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. They have called for a One Health approach which involves stakeholders from all sectors and disciplines since AMR will affect everyone regardless of health condition. Interestingly, many whole medical systems, for instance anthroposophic medicine, traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurveda have developed clinical practices that make use of far less antibiotics than modern medicine [<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Furthermore, there is evidence that general practitioners additionally trained in integrative medicine practices prescribe fewer antibiotics [<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, it appears that the chances offered by integrative medicine practices have not yet been considered by the WHO global action plan.</p><p id="par0015">There is great potential for discovering strategies to counter AMR in the field of integrative medicine. These strategies need to be further implemented in regular health care systems and at the same time the effects of those implemented strategies need to be evaluated in terms of efficacy, safety, cost effectiveness, and patient experience. This special issue on &#x02018;Integrative approaches to antimicrobial resistance&#x02019; brings together a varied palette of new research papers that illustrate how the field is developing and offers promising possibilities for the further development of integrative medicine practices to counter AMR.</p><p id="par0020">The urgency of antimicrobial resistance is specifically addressed in two opinion papers in the Special issue. Hu et al. describe the increasing awareness of the UK government about the AMR problem. According to the former UK Chief Medical Officer Professor Dame Sally Davies &#x0201c;antimicrobial resistance poses a catastrophic threat&#x0201d;. The UK government made AMR a priority, announced in their disease strategy 2020&#x02013;2025 that the UK will become a world player in countering AMR, and allocated 32 million pounds for research in 2018 (Hu et al. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2020.101136" id="intr0005">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2020.101136</ext-link>). Young and Craig (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2020.101072" id="intr0010">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2020.101072</ext-link>) discuss the urgency of antimicrobial resistant tuberculosis, which accounts for a third of deaths due to AMR and is the only antimicrobial resistant pathogen infectious through inhalation known so far. The authors discuss preliminary research about the possibilities of a Japanese traditional moxibustion treatment especially for people with latent tuberculosis.</p><p id="par0025">Of course COVID-19 is the most recent epidemic rapidly spreading around the world with disastrous consequences for many people. In China there is rapidly growing body of experience and research about the use of traditional medicine alongside conventional treatment to treat COVID-19. This special issue contains a paper by Ho et al. (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2020.101116" id="intr0015">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2020.101116</ext-link>) describing the official China National Guidelines for treating COVID-19 with Traditional Chinese Medicine. Zhang et al. (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2019.101045" id="intr0020">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2019.101045</ext-link>) describe in their paper the quality assessment of clinical practice guidelines for the use of Chinese and Western medicine for acute bronchitis. This paper shows that the quality of guidelines concerning Chinese medicines is still insufficient and provides recommendations for improvement. These papers are examples of what is needed to employ traditional medicine in a standardized manner to treat known or unknown infectious diseases and thereby contribute to a reduction of AMR.</p><p id="par0030">Most of the research papers in this special issue deal with discovering antimicrobial, antioxidant, antiviral or toxicological features of plant extracts that are traditionally used in various parts of the world. One of those studies is an RCT on the effects of <italic>Hypericum perforatum</italic> oil on the healing process after episiotomy. Women using the oil reported significantly less perineal pain and faster wound healing than women in the control group (Cobanoglu &#x00026; Sendir <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2019.100995" id="intr0025">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2019.100995</ext-link>). Beside this RCT there are 24 in vitro studies with plant extracts measuring antimicrobial activity, and several studies antioxidant activity and cytotoxicity as well. Six of those 23 studies make use of antimicrobial resistant bacterial strains (Chacon et al. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2019.100996" id="intr0030">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2019.100996</ext-link>, Liu et al. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2019.100999" id="intr0035">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2019.100999</ext-link>, Imane et al. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2020.101074" id="intr0040">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2020.101074</ext-link>, Yamada et al. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2019.101016" id="intr0045">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2019.101016</ext-link>, Aygul &#x00026; Serbetci <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2020.101061" id="intr0050">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2020.101061</ext-link>, Saki et al. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2020.101146" id="intr0055">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2020.101146</ext-link>) and one study looked at antiviral activity (Angamuthu et al. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2019.04.008" id="intr0060">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2019.04.008</ext-link>).

(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2020.101111" id="intr0215">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2020.101111</ext-link>) report on the use of Reduning injection a TCM with <italic>Artemisiae annuae</italic> herba, <italic>Lonicerae japonicae</italic> flos, and <italic>Gardeniae</italic> fructus to treat viral infections. A network pharmacology study revealed 8 key targets of the medicine, and support the hypothesis that the injection can inhibit viral-cell fusion, may have an effect on cytokine storms and protect patients from lung damage. In another network pharmacology study by Zhuang et al. (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2020.101139" id="intr0220">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2020.101139</ext-link>) bioactive compounds and their target genes were studied to elucidate the pharmacological mechanisms of the traditional Chinese medicine Shanhuanglian for respiratory tract infections. Five active compounds (quercetin, luteolin, baicalein, kaempferol, and wogonin) were found to play a central role in the anti-bacterial and anti-viral activity of the drug and three KEGG pathways were mainly involved.</p><p id="par0065">Herbal medicines can play a major role in developing sustainable integrative practices using local herbs to boost the immune system and reduce the effects of inflammatory diseases. However, many herbal medicines are never tested in randomized controlled trials due to lack of financial resources. Baars et al. therefore argue for the use of expert knowledge to provide a lower level of evidence for using IM methods to treat infectious diseases. The authors show that 2 of the 9 most prescribed anthroposophic treatments (Hustenelixer and Echinacea) and 3 of 10 most prescribed homeopathic treatments (Belladonna, Hepar sulphuris, Mercurius solubilis) used for cough and sour throat have been studies in clinical trials (Baars et al. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2020.101194" id="intr0225">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2020.101194</ext-link>).</p><p id="par0070">Beside the development of novel antimicrobial products there is a need to increase awareness about health promotion, and appropriate use of antibiotics when necessary. Hammour et al. (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2019.05.003" id="intr0230">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2019.05.003</ext-link>) conducted a survey amongst 467 parents of young children in Dubai about use of antibiotics in the case of upper respiratory tract infections which are mainly caused by viral infections. 34 % of the parents believed that children with fever should be given antibiotics regardless of the cause, even though 49 % knew that URTIs were caused by a virus. Many parents administered antibiotics without medical advice.</p><p id="par0075">One paper by Vagedes et al. (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2020.101068" id="intr0235">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2020.101068</ext-link>) illustrates how an integrative medicine clinic in which children receive Anthroposophic medicine together with conventional medicine can reduce antibiotics use in children hospitalized for pneumonia. In 32 % of the 252 pneumonia episodes antibiotics were prescribed while in the literature 88&#x02013;98 % antibiotics prescription is reported. Delayed prescription of antibiotics was needed in only 13 % of the patients with presumed bacterial pneumonia. This paper is a great example for other clinics struggling with antibiotics resistance and offers ideas for designing future strategies of reduced antibiotics use.</p><p id="par0080">This special issue shows the enormous potential of herbal medicines in contributing to the development of sustainable, local, integrative medicine practices focussing on strengthening the immune system in order to deal with infectious diseases. This issue also shows that herbal medicines contain many active components that often work in synergy and on multiple targets in the human body. A shift in thinking from disease management towards health promotion is needed both in health care as well as in the general public in order to reduce antibiotics use and subsequently the development of antibiotic resistance.</p></body><back><ref-list id="bibl0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bib0005"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sbref0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>WHO</surname></name></person-group><chapter-title>Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance</chapter-title><year>2015</year><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1128/microbe.10.354.1</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib0010"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref0010"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Baars</surname><given-names>E.W.</given-names></name><name><surname>Zoen</surname><given-names>E.B.</given-names></name><name><surname>Breitkreuz</surname><given-names>T.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The contribution of complementary and alternative medicine to reduce antibiotic use: a narrative review of health concepts, prevention, and treatment strategies</article-title><source>eCAM</source><volume>2019</volume><year>2019</year></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib0015"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref0015"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Van Der Werf</surname><given-names>E.T.</given-names></name><name><surname>Duncan</surname><given-names>L.J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Von Flotow</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name><name><surname>Baars</surname><given-names>E.W.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Do NHS GP surgeries employing GPs additionally trained in integrative or complementary medicine have lower antibiotic prescribing rates?
