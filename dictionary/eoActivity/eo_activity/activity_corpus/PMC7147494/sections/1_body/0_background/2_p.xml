<p>Different types of chemicals have been used to extract the active ingredients from different plant parts. Alam et al [
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] investigated the antibacterial activity of methanol extract as well as the extracts obtained by using petroleum ether, chloroform and ethyl acetatefrom the root bark of Akanda (Calotropis gigantea). They showed that it had significant anti-bacterial activity against most of the bacteria tested. Similarly, antifungal activities of saponins from Tribulusterrestris L. were tested against Candida albicans, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis and Cryptococcus neoformans. Results showed that saponins had significant antifungal activity and kill fungi by destroying the cell membrane [

Many essential oils including those from Eucalyptus have been used in folk medicine throughout the world, and their medicinal properties have been investigated. Essential oils from Eucalyptus sp. exhibit antibacterial, antifungal, analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties and have been widely used in pharmaceutical, food, and cosmetics products [

Keeping in view the aforementioned facts present study has been conducted to see the effect of methanolic extract of leaves of four medicinal plants (i.e. Mentha spp., Aloe berbadensis, Nerium oleander and Eucalyptus spp.) against a pathogenic bacterial and fungal species i.e.(S. aureus and C. albicans) respectively.
