<p>Phenolics and flavonoids are two important phytochemicals reported from different medicinal plants. These compounds mainly help the plant in their response to many stress conditions. The total phenolic contents of the extracted essential oils were examined using the Folin-Ciocalteu method and expressed in terms of gallic acid equivalent. The results of the finding are illustrated in (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>).Total phenolic content was significantly highest in Mentha sp. and lowest in Nerium sp (All p &lt; 0.05). The concentrations of flavonoids in essential oilextracts were determined using spectrophotometric method with Aluminium chloride (AlCl3) and expressed in terms of Quercetin equivalent (mg of Quercetin /gm of extract). The concentration of flavonoids in different plant extracts are shown in (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>).Concentration of flavonoids is low when compared to total phenolic contents. It was as expected, as flavonoids are generally present in very low concentrations in plants. Concentration trend of flavonoids in four experimental plants are similar to concentration trend for totals phenolics. It was highest in Mentha sp. and lowest in Nerium sp (All p &lt; 0.05). Concentration of flavonoids in Eucalyptus sp. and Aloe vera is similar (p &gt; 0.05) and they are in between Mentha and Nerium sp (p &lt; 0.05).
