<p>Results presented in this paper are in agreement with the earlier observations. In this study essential oils extracted from four different plants were used as crude drugs with high efficacy. Local ethnic people to cure different infections, from many generations, use all these plants. This study validates this ethnic knowledge, as the plants were collected from the same locality. Essential oils used in this study have a mixture of chemicals, meaning that developing resistance against them will be hard for the pathogens. If, in future, efficacy of the drug needs to be increased, active ingredients will be identified and used.</p>
