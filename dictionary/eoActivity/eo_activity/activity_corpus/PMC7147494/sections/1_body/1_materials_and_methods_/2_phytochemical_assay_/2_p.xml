<p>Total flavonoid content was measured by the aluminium chloride colorimetric assay [
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. 1 ml off oil was diluted with 4ml of deionised water. Sodium nitrate (300 µl of 5% solution) was added for 5 minutes followed by addition of aluminium chloride (300 µl of 10% solution) for 6 minutes. 2 ml of 1M NaOH was added and final volume was made up to 10 ml with distilled water. The solution was mixed well and absorbance was measured at 510 nm. The total flavonoid content was expressed as mg quercetin equivalents.
