<p>Total Phenolic contents (TPC) and Total Flavonoid Content (TFC): Total phenolic content was determined by the foiln ciocalteau assay [
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] as described below. 1ml of oil extract was mixed with 5ml of 10% folinciocalten reagent and 4ml of sodium carbonate (7.5%) solution. The mixture was inoculated for 20 min at room temperature followed by absorbance measurement at 760 nm. Gallic acid solution was used for preparation of standard curve and the phenolic content of sample was expressed as mg of GAE (Gallic acid equivalent) /gm of the extract.
