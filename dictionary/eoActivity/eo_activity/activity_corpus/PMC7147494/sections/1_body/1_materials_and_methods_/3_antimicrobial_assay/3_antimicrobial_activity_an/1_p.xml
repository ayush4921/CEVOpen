<p>Oils extracted from different plant leaves containing phenolics and flavonoids are used in the study to determine the antimicrobial activity and to calculate minimum inhibitory concentration. A 50 µl test isolates were pipette grown in 96 well ELISA plate (EP1-5x10no, Himedia). Final extract of each plant was considered as their stock (D1: (µg/well). The D1 of Nerium, Mentha, Aloe vera and Eucalyptus are 58, 55, 59 and 58, respectively. Further two dilutions D2 (half of D1) and D3 (half of D2) were prepared by dilution of their respective stock. These three different dilutions (D1 to D3) of the oil samples were used for determination of MIC. The experimental plates were incubated at 35°C for 24 h and 25°C for 72h for bacteria and fungi, respectively. The observations were recorded after 24h and 48h in case of bacteria in an ELISA plate reader. Whereas, fungal growth was recorded after 72 hours of incubation period. There are two controls were used, First growth control and second positive control (antibiotics: 50µg/ml). Positive control was used to compare the effectiveness of drug and growth control was used to observe the effect of the process of antibiotic activity.</p>
