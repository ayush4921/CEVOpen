<p>Mentha spp, Ecalyptus spp, Aloe barbadensis and Nerium oleander were collected from natural habitat of Guru GhasidashVishwavidyalaya campus Bilaspur Chhattisgarh, India.The selected plant parts were used for extractions of phenolic and flavonoid content with microwave assisted extractor (MAE) and used for phytochemical assays. MAE combines microwave and traditional solvent extraction, which increases the kinetic of extraction. MAE has a number of advantagesover traditional methods of extraction, e.g., shorter extraction time, less solvent requirement, higher extraction rate and lower cost [
