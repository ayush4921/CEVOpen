 <italic>M. verticillata</italic> EO nanoemulsion evidenced antibacterial activity against the 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 29213 strain, improving its effect compared to the action of pure EO. Evaluating the safety of this formulation, we can conclude that 
 <italic>M. verticillata</italic> nanoemulsión did not cause toxicity on porcine and equine red blood cells at all concentrations evaluated. The results obtained showed that nanoemulsion could be a potential vehicle for 
 <italic>M. verticillata</italic> essential oil with promissory properties to antibacterial therapy.
