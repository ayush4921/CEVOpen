<p id="p0140">The extraction of 
 <italic>M. verticillata</italic> essential oil (EO) by steam distillation of dry leaves resulted in a slightly yellow liquid with and estimated yield of 4.6% (w/v) based on dry weight. In a previous work, 
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Cariddi et al. (2011)</xref>, obtained a similar yield percentage to EO with 
 <italic>M. verticillata</italic> species from central region of Argentina. Studies of wild peperina shows higher contents of EO in plants of the central area of Argentina than in those from northwest region, this differences were accompanied by changes in the number and size of the glandular trichomes, structures where the EO is synthesized and stored (
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Arteaga et al., 2016</xref>). The chromatographic analysis carried out in the present work reported that the main components identified in the EO were pulegone and menthone, in concordance with the chemotype reported by 
 <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Zygadlo et al. (1996)</xref> for 
 <italic>M. verticillata</italic> specimens from the central region of Argentina. Several studies focused on same species from this area have reported the same chemotype (
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Cariddi et al., 2011</xref>). It is important to highlight that although the results are coincident, there may be variations in the chemical composition of the EO. The percentage of every chemical compound not only depends on the aromatic species in question but also on its stage of development and the environmental conditions to which the plant is exposed at the time of collection (climate, soil, season) (
