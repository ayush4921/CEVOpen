<p id="p0125">The effect of incubation with NE and EO on bacterial growth is showed in 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>. A significant reduction in bacterial growth was observed after 3 h (about 1.28 log UFC/mL). The greatest effect was found after 24 h of incubation with NE (450 mg/mL, equivalent to 27 mg/mL of EO) that produced a 5 log reduction approximately.
