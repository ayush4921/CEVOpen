<p id="p0100">A continuous increase in pH was observed when surfactant concentration increased from 1:1 to 1:4 ratio by maintaining the oil concentration constant. The turbidity of NE decreased when the surfactant concentration increased, while its stability increased (
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">TableÂ 2</xref>). This indicates that varying o/s ratio has a high impact on the nature of colloidal surfaces. To carry out the electron microscopy and the antibacterial properties test, it was decided to use nanoemulsion D, due to its higher stability.
