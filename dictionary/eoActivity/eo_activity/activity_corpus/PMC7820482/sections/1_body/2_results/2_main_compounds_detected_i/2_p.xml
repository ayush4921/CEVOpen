<p id="p0095">The essential oil obtained from fresh leaves showed a yield of 4.6% (w/v). Oil density was 0.95 g/mL and pH was equal to 5.0. In total, 13 compounds were identified with the predominance of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes (98%). Chromatography showed that the most abundant chemical group of 
 <italic>M. verticillata</italic> essential oil was oxygenated monoterpenes, a monoterpenes group attached to an oxygen atom and followed by monoterpenes (C
 <sub>10</sub>H
 <sub>16</sub>). Among these, the main oxygenated monoterpenes reported were monocyclic ketone such as pulegone (76.96%) and menthone (20.38%), and limonene (1.54%). Sesquiterpene group (C
