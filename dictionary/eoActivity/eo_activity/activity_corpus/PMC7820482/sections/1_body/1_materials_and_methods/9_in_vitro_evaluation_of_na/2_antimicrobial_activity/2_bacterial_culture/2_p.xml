 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC 29213 (wound isolated) was cultured in Trypticase Soy Broth (TSB, Britania Laboratory, Ref. B0410361, Argentina) and grown overnight at 37 °C. The concentration of the inoculum was estimated by spectrophotometric turbidity measurement at 600 nm on a microplate reader (Biolatin, Venezuela) and adjusted to an optical density (OD) of 0.07 which corresponds to a 0.5 McFarland standard (1 × 10
