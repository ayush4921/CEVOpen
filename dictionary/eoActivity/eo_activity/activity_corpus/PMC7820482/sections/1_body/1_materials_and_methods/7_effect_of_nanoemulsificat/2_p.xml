<p id="p0055">The effects of nanoencapsulation process on the EO volatile constituents was evaluated using 
 <italic>GC-MS</italic> as previously was described. A sample of pure EO obtained from dry leaves of 
 <italic>M. verticillata</italic> (collected in February 2020) and NE were analyzed. As Tween 20 and water are not compatible with the GC system, EO was separated using the non-polar solvent, n-hexane. The hexane layer was evaporated using a vacuum rotary evaporator. The residual oil was dried over anhydrous Na
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> and kept in a refrigerator (4 °C) until its use. The relative percentage of the identified constituents was calculated from the GC peak areas.
