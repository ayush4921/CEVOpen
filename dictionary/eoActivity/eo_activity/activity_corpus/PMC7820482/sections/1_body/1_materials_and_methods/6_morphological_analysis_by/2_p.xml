<p id="p0050">The morphology of the NE was visualized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Siemens, Elmiskop 101). Samples (50 mL) were placed on 200 mesh formvar coated copper TEM grids, and then negatively stained with 50 mL of 1.5% (weight/volume) phosphotungstic acid for 10 min at room temperature. Excess liquid was blotted with Whatman filter paper. The measurements of droplets were performed using AxioVision software (Carl Zeiss; Oberkochen, Germany).</p>
