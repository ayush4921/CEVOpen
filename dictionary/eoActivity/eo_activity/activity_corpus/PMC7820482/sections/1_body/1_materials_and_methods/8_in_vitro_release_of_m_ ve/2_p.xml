<p id="p0060">The 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> release experiments of the EO were carried out using the dialysis technique (
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Rodrigues et al., 2018</xref>). An aliquot of nanoemulsion was placed inside a dialysis bag (cellulose membrane, molecular weight cut-off 14,000 Da, Roth®), sealed, and immersed in a vessel containing 150 mL of 10 mM phosphate buffer solution (PBS, pH 7.4). The releasing system was maintained at 37 ± 1 °C, under magnetic stirring (100 rpm). Samples (1 mL) were taken out of the dissolution medium at different time intervals (1, 3, 6, 9 and 24 h). This volume was replaced with fresh PBS, and the sample was analyzed by UV spectrophotometry at 260 nm. In order to establish the linearity of the proposed method, three calibration curves were constructed at eight concentrations levels within the range of 2–10 μg/mL solubilizing a known amount of EO in ethanol. The release profile of 
 <italic>M. verticillata</italic> EO was expressed as cumulative amount of released EO (mean ± SD) and plotted 
 <italic>versus</italic> time. The experiments were carried out in triplicate.
