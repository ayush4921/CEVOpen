<p id="p0080">The total number of bacteria was determined by plating serial dilutions (1:10
 <sup>4</sup> to 1:10
 <sup>8</sup>) of the content of each well on Petri dishes containing Trypticase soy agar (TSA); the dishes were incubated at 37 Â°C for 24 h, and colonies counted. The number of bacteria was calculated, based on the dilution factor. To normalize the data, a positive control (0.2 % Triton x100) and negative control (PBS) were used.
