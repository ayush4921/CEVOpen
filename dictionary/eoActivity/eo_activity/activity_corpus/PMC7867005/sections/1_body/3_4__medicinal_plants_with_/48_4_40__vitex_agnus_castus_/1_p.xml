<p>The hypoglycemic activity of 
 <italic>V. agnus-castus</italic> was confirmed in streptozocin diabetic rats. The hypoglycemic and pancreatic protective effects were observed in aging animal models after treatment with fruit extract. Aging, insulin resistance, and 
 <italic>Î²</italic>-cells destruction were all improved after treatment with the extract [

 <italic>V. agnus-castus</italic> showed the strongest antiglycation inhibitory activity, which may lead to a protective effect [
