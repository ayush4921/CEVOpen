<p>Both ethyl acetate and petrolum ether extracts of 
 <italic>Haplophyllum myrtifolium</italic> showed a similar, significant, 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase inhibition rate that was higher than that of the methanol and water extracts. For the 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase-inhibitory effect, the ethyl acetate extract exhibited the highest activity followed, by the petroleum ether and methanol extracts. However, the water extract tested did not have any effect on the 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase activity [
