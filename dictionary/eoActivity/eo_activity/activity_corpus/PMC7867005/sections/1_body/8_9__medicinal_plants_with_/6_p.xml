<p>The lyophilized hydrophilic extract obtained from leaves of 
 <italic>Cichorium intybus</italic> effectively suppressed the activity of 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase, but the inhibitory activity towards 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase was limited. It is well known that plant extracts which selectively inhibit 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase are the preferred agents in controlling the uptake of glucose in diabetes. The inhibition of both enzymes would result in abnormal bacterial fermentation in the colon due to the presence of undigested carbohydrates [
