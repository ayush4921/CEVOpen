<p>The ethanol extract of 
 <italic>T. stellate</italic> did not show any significant activation of PPAR
 <italic>α</italic> and PPAR
 <italic>γ</italic> (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor 
 <italic>α</italic>/
 <italic>γ</italic>), but the ethyl acetate fraction showed activation of both genes. On other hand, the isolated compounds, methoxyisoflavan and dimethoxyisoflavan derivatives, showed an increase in PPAR
 <italic>α</italic> activity, while the other compound, glucopyranosyl isoflavan derivative, showed an ability to activate the PPAR
 <italic>γ</italic> receptor. The other reported isolated compounds manifested a mild to moderate activation of PPAR
 <italic>γ</italic> receptors [
