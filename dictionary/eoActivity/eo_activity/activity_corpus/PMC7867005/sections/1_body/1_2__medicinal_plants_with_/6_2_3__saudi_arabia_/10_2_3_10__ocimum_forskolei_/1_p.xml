<p>The 
 <italic>O.forskolei</italic> extract from leaves and stem showed promising results in the 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase inhibition assay. They almost had the same potential for 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase inhibition (72.3 and 78.9 µg/mL, for leaves and corollas extracts, respectively), suggesting that 
 <italic>O. forskolei</italic> might be effective in slowing down the hydrolysis of polysaccharides [
