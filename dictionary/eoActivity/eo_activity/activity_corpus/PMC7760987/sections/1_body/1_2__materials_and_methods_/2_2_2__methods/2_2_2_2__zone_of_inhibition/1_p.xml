<p>The zone of inhibition test was carried out according to the standardized methodology National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards [
 <xref rid="B26-polymers-12-02883" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] in order to verify the antimicrobial activity of copaiba oil against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Enterobacter aerogenes</italic>, and 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>. Initially, the culture was activated in 5 mL of BHI broth and incubated in a bacteriological oven (Solab, SL-101, Piracicaba, Brazil) at 35 ± 2 °C for 18 h. Then, the absorbance of the inoculum was determined in a spectrophotometer (Marconi, Jenway 7310, Staffordshire, UK) at 675 nm, in which the suspension turbidity was adjusted to a 0.5 McFarland standard solution (10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU mL
 <sup>−1</sup>). Then, 100 µL of the inoculum was seeded on plates containing Mueller–Hinton agar culture medium and filter paper discs (5.5 mm in diameter), impregnated with copaiba oil, were added. The plates were incubated in a bacteriological oven (Solab, SL-101, Piracicaba, Brazil) at 35 ± 2 °C for 24 h. After this period, microbial growth was observed and the degree of inhibition was expressed as inhibition zone (mm).
