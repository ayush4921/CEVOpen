 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot2dot2-polymers-12-02883">Section 2.2.2</xref>. The filter paper discs (5.5 mm in diameter) were impregnated with oil diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide in sterile tubes containing a total volume of 1 mL, in the following concentrations: 3, 6, 12, 25, 50, and 100% of copaiba oil and a period of 1 min was required for the paper disc to be impregnated with the respective concentrations of copaiba oil. Then, the impregnated discs were placed on plates containing the seeded inoculum and were incubated in a bacteriological incubator at 35 ± 5 ° C for 24 h. After this period, microbial growth and MIC with an inhibition zone of ≥ 8 mm were detected [
