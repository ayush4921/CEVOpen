<p>Initially, mangarito starch and glycerol were dispersed in distilled water under mechanical stirring (IKA, Color Squid, Staufen, Germany) at 200 rpm, using a thermostatic bath (Marconi, MA 127, Piracicaba, Brazil) at 97 °C for 20 min. For the incorporation of copaiba oil and microparticles, the filmogenic solution was cooled down to 45 °C. The copaiba oil was added using Ultra-Turrax (IKA, T25 Digital Ultra-Turrax, Staufen, Germany), for 4 min at 10.000 rpm [

In addition, films incorporated with copaiba oil, directly or microencapsulated, were produced without the addition of plasticizer, with the control film being composed of mangarito starch and glycerol. The filmogenic solutions were dispersed on acrylic plates (12 cm × 12 cm) and dried for 24 h at 30 °C in an air circulating oven (Marconi, MA035, Piracicaba, Brazil). After this period, the films were packed in desiccators (Nalgon, 810, Itupeva, Brazil) containing NaBr (58% RH, Dynamic, Indaiatuba, Brazil).
