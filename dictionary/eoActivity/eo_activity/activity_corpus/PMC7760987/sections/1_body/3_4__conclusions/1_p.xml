<p>Copaiba oil has antimicrobial activity, with Î²-caryophyllene (48.29%) as the major compound, and a minimum inhibitory concentration of 12%, against 
 <italic>B. subtilis and S. aureus</italic>. It was possible to produce 
 <italic>Xanthosoma mafaffa</italic> Schott starch-based films with the oil incorporated directly as well as microencapsulated. The incorporation of this oil in microencapsulated form, in comparison to the direct incorporation, increased the tensile strength, elongation, and moisture, and reduced the transmittance. In relation to the control film, both forms of oil incorporation reduced the solubility and increased the contact angle of the films. Thus, mangarito starch-based films added with copaiba oil could be considered a packaging alternative for food application.
