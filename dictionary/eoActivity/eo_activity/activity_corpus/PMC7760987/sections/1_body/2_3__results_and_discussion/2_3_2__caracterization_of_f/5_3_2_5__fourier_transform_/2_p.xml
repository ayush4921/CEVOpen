<p>In the 4000 to 2500 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> region, the spectra show absorption bands at 3296 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, which correspond to the −OH stretch formed with hydroxyl groups of starch and glycerol [

 <xref rid="B73-polymers-12-02883" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] and between 2918 and 2926 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, attributed to the absorption of alkanes due to the stretching of C–H [
 <xref rid="B75-polymers-12-02883" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. While in the region from 2000 to 1500 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, absorption bands were observed between 1642 and 1648 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, which corresponds to the angular deformation of −OH bonds [
 <xref rid="B74-polymers-12-02883" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. A small peak at 1553 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> was observed only in the film with microencapsulated oil (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-02883-f005">Figure 5</xref>c), characteristic of the amino group [
 <xref rid="B66-polymers-12-02883" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. This peak can be related to the microparticle covering material, since Dammak et al. [
 <xref rid="B62-polymers-12-02883" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] reported that gelatin films showed an amino band at 1537 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>.
