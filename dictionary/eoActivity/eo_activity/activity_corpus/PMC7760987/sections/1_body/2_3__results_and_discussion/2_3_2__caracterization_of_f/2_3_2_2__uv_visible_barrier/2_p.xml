<p>The film incorporated directly with copaiba oil also showed lower transmittance up to ~330 nm in relation to the control film however, the transmittance was higher in the visible region, possibly due to the form of incorporation applied, which can cause the formation of less homogeneous films. The transmittance values obtained for the three formulations were lower than those reported for the oriented propylene and the low-density polyethylene, which are plastics used as packaging [

 <xref rid="B61-polymers-12-02883" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] reported that films of green banana starch showed less light transmittance after the incorporation of lipid microparticles of ascorbic acid. The transmittance of the films incorporated with microencapsulated oil were also lower than that of the gelatin-based films incorporated with microparticles of chitosan [
