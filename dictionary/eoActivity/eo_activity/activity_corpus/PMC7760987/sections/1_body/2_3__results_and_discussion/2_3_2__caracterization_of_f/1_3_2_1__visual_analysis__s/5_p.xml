<p>Martínez-Ortiz et al. [
 <xref rid="B55-polymers-12-02883" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] reported that ascorbic acid microcapsules remained dispersed in a small area of the film, being better observed when the microcapsule concentration was higher. The authors also suggested that the increase in the number of microparticles contributed to the increase in the films’ mechanical properties. Moraes Crizel et al. [
 <xref rid="B56-polymers-12-02883" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] reported that a higher concentration of papaya peel microparticles smoothed the surface of gelatin films, making them similar to the control film.
