<p>The copaiba oil showed an inhibition zone of 7.75 to 15.00 mm for 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and of 6.86 to 15.00 mm for 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, the increase in the oil concentration led to an increase in the inhibition zone. According to Ponce et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-polymers-12-02883" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and Palmeira et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-polymers-12-02883" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], a satisfactory inhibitory activity is observed in zones with a â‰¥ 8 mm diameter therefore, 12% of copaiba oil was selected as MIC.
