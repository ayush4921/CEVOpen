<p>Pelissari et al. [
 <xref rid="B66-polymers-12-02883" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] reported absorption regions at 3304, 2922, 1164, 1077, 1019, and 921 cm
 <sup>âˆ’1</sup> for cassava starch and glycerol films, which are very similar to the bands obtained in the present study. In general, no difference in peaks or displacement of absorption bands was identified. Brandelero et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-polymers-12-02883" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] reported that copaiba and lemongrass essential oils did not promote changes in the intensity and position of peaks and bands, indicating that there were no chemical interactions between the essential oils and film matrix and, therefore, the bioactive effects of essential oils were not compromised after mixing.
