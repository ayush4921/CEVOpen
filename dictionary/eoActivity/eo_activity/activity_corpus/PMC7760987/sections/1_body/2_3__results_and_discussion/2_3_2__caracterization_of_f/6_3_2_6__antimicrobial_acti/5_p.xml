<p>According to Medeiros et al. [
 <xref rid="B21-polymers-12-02883" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], the efficiency of the films in acting as active packaging is influenced not only by the concentration of oil, but also by the diffusion of the bioactive compounds into the medium, which in return depend on the interactions between the components, as well as their disposition inside the film. Microencapsulation of bioactive compounds is a technology that allows isolating and preserving compounds from inactivation by external agents [

 <xref rid="B18-polymers-12-02883" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] reported an inhibition zone of 22 mm against
