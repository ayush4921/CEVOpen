<p>The 1500 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> region corresponds to the digital fingerprint of the spectrum, in which there is a large number of absorptions due to a variety of vibrations of simple bonds [
 <xref rid="B75-polymers-12-02883" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. The absorption bands at 1078, 1077, 950, 996, and 926 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> correspond to C–OH and CH
 <sub>2</sub> deformations [
 <xref rid="B74-polymers-12-02883" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. According to Lima et al. [
 <xref rid="B74-polymers-12-02883" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], the absorption bands in the region of 1200 to 1000 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> are characteristic of starch, attributed to vibrations of axial deformation of C–O and O–C–O.
