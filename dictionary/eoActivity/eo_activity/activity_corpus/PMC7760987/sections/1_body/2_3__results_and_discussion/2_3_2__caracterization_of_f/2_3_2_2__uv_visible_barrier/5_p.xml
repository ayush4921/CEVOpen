<p>According to 
 <xref rid="polymers-12-02883-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, the films showed luminosity (L*) ranging from 90.84 to 90.13, and the incorporation of oil and microparticles reduced this parameter. The film incorporated directly with copaiba oil did not differ significantly from the others, indicating that copaiba oil did not interfere with the luminosity. On the other hand, the film incorporated with microencapsulated copaiba oil differed (p &lt; 0.05) from the control film. Å uput et al. [
 <xref rid="B59-polymers-12-02883" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] also observed a reduction in the luminosity of corn starch-based films after the addition of essential cumin oil (L* = 95.32 to 93.25) and oregano (L* = 95.32 to 91.36).
