<p>In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-02883-f004">Figure 4</xref>, it was observed that the film added with microencapsulated copaiba oil showed lower transmittance in comparison to the others, indicating that the form in which the copaiba oil was incorporated influenced the UV/Vis barrier. Similarly, Al-Hassan and Norziah [
 <xref rid="B58-polymers-12-02883" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] reported that sago starch/fish gelatin films showed higher energy absorption than films without gelatin. According to Å uput et al. [
 <xref rid="B59-polymers-12-02883" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], the light absorption in starch-based films is proportional to the addition of essential oil in the visible range (350 to 800 nm). When the oil is added at an appropriate concentration, the films can be applied as food packaging capable of controlling oxidative changes.
