<p>One of the biggest challenges of applying polysaccharides to films for food packaging is high sensitivity to water [
 <xref rid="B70-polymers-12-02883" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. The value of the contact angle allows monitoring the hydrophilic and hydrophobic character of the film surface therefore, the contact angle increases according to the hydrophobicity of the surface [
 <xref rid="B71-polymers-12-02883" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Hydrophilic surfaces have contact angle values of &lt;20°, while hydrophobic surfaces have values of &gt;70° [
