 <italic>Ximenia americana</italic> plants have economic, medicinal, and forage values; in addition, they preserve cultural heritages and maintain ecological balance by providing various ecosystem services. However, the plant faced threats of extinction due to forest clearing, grazing, timber harvesting, charcoal making, drought, and bark and root harvesting. And also, the conservation status is very low as compared to other wild edible fruit plants. Hence, the most important conservation options which can reverse the problem are sustaining multipurpose uses, rehabilitating, improving the ecosystem and enhancing its services, enhance resilience to climate change, promoting indigenous knowledge, and diversify food sources and biocultural heritage. In addition, to conserve this resource, systems such as medicinal gardens, proper handling practices, and scientific development are needed to be implemented.
