 <bold>Analysis of essential oils. </bold>Analysis of the essential oil was performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The chromatograph (7890S/5975C; Agilent, London, UK) was equipped with a capillary column (HP-5MS; 30.00 m × 0.25 mm ID × 0.25 µm film thickness). The carrier gas was helium, and the split ratio was 1.00 mL min
 <sup>-1</sup>. The column temperature was at first 40.00 ˚C, and then gently increased to 300 ˚C at a 5.00 ˚C per min rate and kept for 1 min. The mass spectrometer operated in electronic impact ionization mode and the energy of the electrons was kept at 70.00 eV. Identification of the major constituents of the essential oil was attained based on a comparison between their retention index, computer library information, and standard mass spectral fragmentation pattern (Wiley/NBS). The percentage of each essential oil compositions was calculated from GC peak areas.
