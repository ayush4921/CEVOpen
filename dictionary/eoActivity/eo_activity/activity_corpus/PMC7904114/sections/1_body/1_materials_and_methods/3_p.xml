 <bold>Agar disk diffusion assay. </bold>The antibacterial activity of essential oils and sodium benzoate was examined by agar disk diffusion assay.
 <sup>16</sup> Sterile filter paper disks (6.00 mm diameter; Padtan Teb, Tehran, Iran) were impregnated with 30.00 μL of essential oil and sodium benzoate, equivalent to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), aseptically placed on the surface of inoculated Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA; Quelab, Montréal, Canada) medium with adjusted suspension (0.5 McFarland standard turbidity) of the bacteria. The dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Samchun Chemical Co. Seoul, South Korea) as the solvent of essential oils only was considered as a negative control. Erythro-mycin (15.00 µg), streptomycin (10.00 µg), gentamicin (10.00 µg), and ciprofloxacin (5.00µg) per disk were used as a positive control. The inoculated plates were incubated overnight at 37.00 ˚C for 24 hr. Antimicrobial activity was evaluated by measuring the zone of growth inhibition in millimeters. Each experiment was tested in triplicate.
