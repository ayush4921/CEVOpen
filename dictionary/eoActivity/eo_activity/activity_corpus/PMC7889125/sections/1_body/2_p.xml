<p>Chloroplast genomes are rich with genetic information, and their sequences are thus often used as foundational data in research on the evolution of species and the phylogenetic relationships among species. It is characterized not only by its matrilineal inheritance, but also by its high conservation of gene sequences. The chloroplast genomes of hundreds of tropical crops have been sequenced in recent years, but the chloroplast genome of 
 <italic>P. caerulea</italic> has not been reported until now. In this study, the chloroplast genome of 
 <italic>P. caerulea</italic> was sequenced, assembled, and annotated.
