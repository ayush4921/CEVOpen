 <italic>Passiflora caerulea</italic> L. belongs to the family Passifloraceae L. and is popularly known as wild passion, blue passion flower, or red-pulp passion (Bandeira et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Because it is shaped like an egg and has fruit juice the color of an egg yolk, it is also known as egg fruit. The species is native to Brazil (Dhawan et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) and valuable in the pharmaceutical industry for its aerial parts, including its leaves, flowers, fruits, and roots (Rathod et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). 
 <italic>Passiflora caerulea</italic> contains the flavonoid chrysin, which is a sedative with action similar to diazepam, but its activity is ten times lower with no myorelaxant effect (Medina et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>; Speroni et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). Moreover, animals that received 
 <italic>P. caerulea</italic> infusion showed decreases in biomarkers associated with physiological stress, demonstrating the phototherapeutic action of this plant species (Karina et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Accordingly, its fruit has been used as a diuretic, painkiller, and sedative, and its roots have also been used for their anthelmintic action (Dhawan et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>).
