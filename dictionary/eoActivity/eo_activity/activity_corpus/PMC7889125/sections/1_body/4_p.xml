<p>The double-stranded and circular complete chloroplast genome of 
 <italic>P. caerulea</italic> was 151,362 bp in total, including 46,942 A bases (31.01%), 48,371 T bases (31.96%), 27,391 G bases (18.10%), and 28,658 C bases (18.93%). Like most other plants (Li et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Niu et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>), the chloroplast genome of 
 <italic>P. caerulea</italic> has a quadripartite structure, includes a large 85,623-bp single-copy region (LSC) and a small 13,397-bp single-copy region (SSC) separated by two inverted repeat regions (IRa and IRb), each 26,180 bp in length. Unlike 
 <italic>Passiflora capsularis</italic> and 
 <italic>Passiflora costaricensis</italic>, the IR region of the chloroplast genome of 
 <italic>P. caerulea</italic> is not lost (Cauz-Santos et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The overall GC content of the whole 
 <italic>P. caerulea</italic> chloroplast genome is 37.03%, with corresponding values of the LSC, SSC, and IR regions of 34.79%, 31.55%, and 42.10%, respectively. Additionally, the 
 <italic>P. caerulea</italic> chloroplast genome was determined to encode a total of 131 genes, including 79 protein-coding genes, 37 tRNA genes, 8 rRNA genes, and 7 pseudogenes.
