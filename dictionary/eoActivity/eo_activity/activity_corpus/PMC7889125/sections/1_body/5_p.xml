<p>To examine the phylogenetic relationship of 
 <italic>P. caerulea</italic> to its congeners, a maximum likelihood tree based on the complete chloroplast genome sequences of 
 <italic>P. caerulea</italic> and 28 other 
 <italic>Passiflora</italic> spp. was constructed with 
 <italic>Adenia mannii</italic> (family Passifloraceae L.) used as the out group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>). The chloroplast genome sequences of 29 species were downloaded from GenBank (accession numbers shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>). Multiple sequence alignment was conducted with MAFFT (Katoh and Standley 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), and the phylogenetic analysis was conducted with RAxML8.2.4 (Stamatakis 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Node support was estimated from the results of 1000 bootstrap replicates. In the phylogenetic tree, most nodes had high bootstrap support values exceeding 84. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that 
 <italic>Passiflora edulis</italic> is most closely related to 
 <italic>P. caerulea.</italic> This study provides abundant genomic data for the conservation genetics of 
 <italic>P. caerulea</italic> as well as for future phylogenetic studies of the genus 
 <italic>Passiflora</italic> and the family Passifloraceae more broadly.
