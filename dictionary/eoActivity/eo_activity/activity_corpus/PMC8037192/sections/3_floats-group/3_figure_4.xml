 <caption>
  <p>The effects of different doses of AG (1, 5 and 10 μM) with specific induction medium (IM) of each differentiation type on tri-lineage differentiation potentials of cells from SPFP-MSCs on day 21 compared with specific induction medium without AG as control. The scale bar (▬▬) in (
   <bold>A</bold>,
   <bold>B</bold>,
   <bold>D</bold>–
   <bold>F</bold>) represents 500 µm and 200 µm, respectively. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Osteogenic differentiation; Alizarin red S staining reflected that the calcium droplets. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Adipogenic differentiation; Oil Red O staining reflected that lipid droplets. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Chondrogenic differentiation; After a cell pellet was treated with chondrogenic medium and chondrogenic medium with AG. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Pellet cultures of SPFP-MSCs were sectioned and stained with Hematoxylin &amp; Eosin reflected that morphology. (
   <bold>E</bold>) Pellet cultures of SPFP-MSCs were sectioned and stained with toluidine blue reflected that glycosaminoglycans. (
   <bold>F</bold>) Pellet cultures of SPFP-MSCs were sectioned and stained with alcian blue reflected that proteoglycans.
