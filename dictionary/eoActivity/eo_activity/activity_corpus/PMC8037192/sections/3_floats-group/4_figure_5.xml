  <p>The effects of different doses of AG (1,5 and 10 µM) on tri-lineage differentiation potentials of cells from SPFP tissues on day 21. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Osteogenic differentiation: (Runx2, OPN), (
   <bold>B</bold>) Adipogenic differentiation: (PPAR-γ2, LPL), (
   <bold>C</bold>) Chondrogenic differentiation: (Sox9, Aggrecan). Gene expression of tri-lineage potentials was assessed using real-time PCR. The bar means SD. Data is shown as mean ± SD (
   <italic>n</italic> = 10). Statistical significance was calculated using a one-way ANOVA test and significance is represented on graphs as * 
   <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05.
