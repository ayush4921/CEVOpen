<p>Adipogenesis: SPFP-MSCs were seeded at a cell density of 5000 cells/cm
 <sup>2</sup> and when the SPFP-MSCs were &gt;90% confluent, the growth medium was substituted with in-house, freshly prepared differentiation medium containing 10 µg/mL insulin, 100 nM dexamethasone, 0.45 mM 3-isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX), and 50 µg/mL indomethacin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The cells were then incubated in AG-containing media at varying concentrations (1, 5, and 10 μM) for 21 days. The adipogenic differentiation was evaluated from formalin-fixed cell cultures by incubating with 0.3% (
