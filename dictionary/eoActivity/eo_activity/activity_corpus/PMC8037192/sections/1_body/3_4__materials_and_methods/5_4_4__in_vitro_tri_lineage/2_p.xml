<p>Osteogenesis: SPFP-MSCs were seeded at a cell density of 5000 cells/cm
 <sup>2</sup> in osteogenic medium, prepared freshly in house and containing 10 nM dexamethasone, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate and 50 μg/mL ascorbate-2 phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and with 10% FBS. SPFP-MSC cultures were maintained into AG containing media at various concentrations (1, 5, and 10 μM) for 21 days. Medium was changed every 3 days. The extracellular calcium deposits were determined from 100% ethanol-fixed cell cultures by incubating with 0.2% 
 <italic>w/v</italic> Alizarin Red S solution for 40 min at room temperature. Excess dye was removed by several washing steps using water and observed under an inverted light microscope.
