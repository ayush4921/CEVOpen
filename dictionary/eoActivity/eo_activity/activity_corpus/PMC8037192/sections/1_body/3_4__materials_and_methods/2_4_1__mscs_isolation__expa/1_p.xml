<p>SPFP tissues were harvested during TKA with tissues and then used for cell isolation, and for collecting mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) according to a previously published protocol [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-26-01831" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In brief, SPFP tissues from resections were rinsed and washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Gibco™, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA), and then chopped in to small pieces. After that, 0.1% collagenase type I solution (Gibco™, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) was added and incubated under warm-water bath (37 °C) for 60 min then suspended with Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium-High glucose (DMEM-HG) (Gibco™, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco™, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) and centrifuged at 400× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min and the surfactant layer was removed. The resulting pellet was mixed with 15 mL of complete medium (DMEM-HG + 10% FBS + 1% L-glutamic acid (Gibco™, Life Technologies) + 1% Pen-strep (Gibco™, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA), then passed through a sterile filter/cell strainer (Corning Inc., Corning, NY, USA) and finally seeded in T-175 tissue culture flasks (Wuxi NEST Biotechnology, Nanjing, China) which were placed in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Culture medium was replaced every 3 days. If cells expanded to more than 80% of the culture flask, then SPFP cells were detached with 0.05% Trypsin/0.1% EDTA (Gibco™, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) and recultured as the first passage with complete medium through 2nd passage. Cell count and time between each passage were recorded. Suprapatellar fat pad derived mesenchymal stem cells (SPFP-MSCs) in the first passage were trypsinized and divided for the following assays following International Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT).
