<p>Chondrogenesis: The SPFP-MSCs were cultured to form a cell pellet in a 15 mL polypropylene tube (Wuxi NEST Biotechnology). Approximately 2 × 105 cells were cultured in chondrogenic medium (CM) with in-house, freshly prepared medium with the presence of 10 nM dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 ng/mL transforming growth factor-β3 (TGF-β3) (ProSpec, Rehovot, Israel) and 6.25 μg/mL insulin-transferrin-selenium (ITS supplement) (MP Biomedicals LLC, Irvine, CA, USA) were expanded. The cells were then incubated with andrographolide-containing media at different concentrations (1, 5, and 10 μM) for 21 days with medium changes every 3 days. Alcian blue, Toluidine Blue, and Haematoxylin &amp; Eosin (H&amp;E) were used to detect the presence of enrichment of glycosaminoglycans in cartilage, polysaccharides and morphology, respectively. Before staining, the cell pellet cultures were fixed in formalin then embedded in paraffin and sectioned into 4–5 μm and stained with H&amp;E, Alcian Blue and Toluidine Blue. The sections were observed under an inverted light microscope.</p>
