<p>Andrographolide (AG, C
 <sub>20</sub>H

 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-01831" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], hepatoprotective [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-26-01831" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and anti-inflammatory properties, in both in vitro and in vivo [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-01831" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Moreover, it has been reported that AG has both stimulating effects on osteoblastogenesis [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-01831" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and inhibiting effects on osteoclastogenesis by inhibiting nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathways in vitro and in vivo [

 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-01831" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. AG has been performed in cartilage explants to the in vitro potent chondroprotective activities and therapeutic use in equine degenerative joint diseases [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-01831" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and showed a protective effect on oxidative stress in chondrocytes injured by H

 <xref rid="B25-molecules-26-01831" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Thus, AG is promising to treat the progressive loss of bone and cartilage which is a main sign in early stage of OA diseases. AG has been reported to have a potential to treat periodontal disease [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-01831" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and cardiovascular disease in obese patients [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-01831" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] as well. In addition, the clinical studies have reported AG administration significantly improved the CD4+ lymphocyte count in HIV- positive patients [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-26-01831" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and inhibited the gp120-mediated cell fusion of HL2/3 cells with TZM-bl cells [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-26-01831" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Moreover, publications related with the effects of natural molecules on osteogenesis of stem cells has been currently increased [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-26-01831" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-26-01831" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-26-01831" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Stimulating bone and cartilage formation with biologically active pharmaceuticals derived from natural sources is a direction worth investigating for the treatment of homeostasis of bone diseases and/or bone remodeling in regenerative medicine field. Due to the lack of cytotoxicity and evidence of the effects of AG on multilineage differentiation in human mesenchymal stem cells, this study is aimed to investigate the effects of AG on the in vitro cytotoxicity, and human mesenchymal stem cell differentiation in order to identify potential mechanisms of action.
