<p>One of the hallmarks of OA is the progressive loss that occur in the articular and subarticular cartilage structures. The early stage in the course of the disease is a significantly involves a degradation and re-modelling (both bone formation and resorption) of the bone cartilage interface, especially in areas underlying damaged cartilage. The trabecular bone and the cortical subchondral plate thickens and becomes increasingly irregular [

In addition, health problems of excessive osteoclast formation and bone resorption can cause an imbalance in bone remodeling and thus induce many adult skeletal diseases, including osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, multiple myeloma, metastatic cancers, premature menopause, low levels of testosterone and estrogen in men, all potentially leading to changes in cartilage homeostasis.
