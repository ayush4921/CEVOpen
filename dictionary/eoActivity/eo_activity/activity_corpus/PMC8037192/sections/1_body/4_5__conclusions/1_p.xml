<p>In conclusion, this study is the first to demonstrate that AG in the concentration where cell viability was more than 90% could promote coupled cell proliferation. Moreover, AG could promote osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation in a dose-dependent manner whereas inhibit their adipogenesis of SPFP-MSCs. Furthermore, AG is associated with regulation of osteocyte-specific markers including Runx2, OPN and chondrocyte-specific markers including Sox9 and Aggrecan activity, and its anti- adipogenic effect is associated with blocking PPAR-Î³2 and LPL signaling. Our data also strongly suggested that AG could be developed and expected for the possibility to translate the results to human clinical practice as a treatment for regenerative medicine for cartilage and bone regeneration. Moreover, our laboratory has foreseen the possible new class of therapeutic agents similar to AG. Thus, we are continuously investigating similar effect of molecules that have structural like estrogen from Thai medicinal herb on mesenchymal stem cells. The mechanistic insights into biological activities of these molecules are explored.</p>
