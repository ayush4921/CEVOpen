<p>There are two major modes of osteogenesis, and both involve the transformation of a preexisting mesenchymal tissue into chondroblast, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts. The mesenchymal stem cells differentiate into chondroblasts and chondrocytes and this cartilage is later replaced by bone. The important markers for osteogenic differentiation, Runx2 and OPN, where Runx2 is a master regulator in the late-stage marker of osteogenesis and OPN is the important intermediate stage marker during the differentiation into mature osteoblasts for osteogenic differentiation followed by matrix maturation and matrix mineralization [

The previous study also showed that AG exhibits the inhibitory effects on osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast function in vitro and in vivo through the suppression of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-ÎºB) and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathways [
