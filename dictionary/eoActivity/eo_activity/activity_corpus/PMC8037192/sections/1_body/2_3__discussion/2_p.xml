Several studies have shown that its main bioactive component, AG, has a broad range of beneficial pharmacological effects, such as antiviral, anti-malarial, immunostimulatory, and anti-inflammatory. Moreover, it contains bioactive molecules like estrogen. In the present study, we have significant findings. We have demonstrated that AG did not influence cell viability when it was used at concentrations ranging from 1.56 to 12.5 μM. This indicates that AG did not have an effect on human mesenchymal stem cells. In addition, we also originally demonstrated for the first time that AG promoted osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation of SPFP-MSCs and suppressed their adipogenic differentiation.
