<p>In order to investigate whether AG could inhibit adipogenic differentiation of SPFP-MSCs, the adipocyte-specific markers including PPAR-γ2 and LPL and also qualitative of adipocytes number (Oil Red O staining) were examined. The PPAR-γ2 which has been shown to play an important role in mature adipocyte differentiation as a terminal differentiation marker, lipid storage, insulin sensitization and can be activated by fatty acids [

AG suppressed both PPAR-γ2 and LPL mRNA expression by inhibiting adipocyte cells formation. These results suggested that AG could suppress the adipogenic differentiation both qualitatively and quantitatively.
