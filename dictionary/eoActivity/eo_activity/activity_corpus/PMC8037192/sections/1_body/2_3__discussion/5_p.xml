<p>In this study, we used an in vitro cell pellet culture of chondrogenesis for 21 days derived from SPFP-MSCs and found the different concentrations of AG were able to significantly enhance differentiation in a dose-dependent manner by upregulating a number of genes associated with chondrogenesis such as Sox9 and Aggrecan under chondrogenic plus AG extract conditions [

In addition, qualitative study exhibited increased synthesis of matrix proteoglycans and visible formation of glycosaminoglycan when stained with toluidine blue and alcian blue [
