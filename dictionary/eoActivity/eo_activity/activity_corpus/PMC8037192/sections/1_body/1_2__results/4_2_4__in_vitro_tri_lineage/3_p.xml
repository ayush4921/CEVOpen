<p>Using these isolated cells from SPFP, we further determined the adipogenic potential of cells with cultures using adipogenic induction medium (AM), these cells became more elongated and flatter. 5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells per well were seeded in 6 well plates in triplicate in expansion medium. After 24 h, confluent cell populations (90% confluency) from SPFP were promoted by treating expansion medium cultures with AM containing AG at different concentrations (1, 5, and 10 μM). SPFP-MSCs were observed, especially at the sites where lipid droplets became visible and compared with SPFP-MSCs maintained in AM for 3 weeks as control groups. After 3 weeks, lipid droplets were confirmed by oil red O staining to visualize accumulated cytoplasmic lipid rich vacuoles (
