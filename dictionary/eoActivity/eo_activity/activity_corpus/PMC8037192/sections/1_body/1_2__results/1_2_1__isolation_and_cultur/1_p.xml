<p>Cells from SPFP samples were isolated by enzymatic digestion. After cultures had been incubated for 3 days, the isolated cells markedly spread out and adhered to the plastic culture flask. By 4–5 days, cells exhibited homogenous spindle-shaped, fibroblast-like morphology. As time went on, the cells evinced a high proliferation rapidly and took on a clustered appearance. Cultures reached 80–90% confluence in 7–10 days. Following the first sub-culturing, approximately 4–5 days were needed for each passage. Cell morphology remained homogeneous until being terminated (
