<p>In osteogenesis differentiation, cells seeded at 5 × 104 cells per well were seeded in 6 well plates in triplicate in culture medium. After 24 h, confluent cell populations (90% confluency) from SPFP-MSCs were promoted by treating cells cultures with osteogenic induction medium (OM) containing AG at different concentrations (1, 5, and 10 μM) while cells maintained in OM were used as controls. After 3 weeks, cells were stained with alizarin red S to confirm the accumulation of calcium (
