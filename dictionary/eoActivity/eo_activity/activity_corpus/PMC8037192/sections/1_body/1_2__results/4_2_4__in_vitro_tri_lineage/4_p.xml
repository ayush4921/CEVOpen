<p>Further analysis made was to evaluate chondrogenic differentiation capacity (pellets) of isolated MSCs from SPFP. Pellets were either introduced to CM containing AG at different concentrations (1, 5, and 10 μM) or CM with 1% FBS. The cells had grown and formed dense spheroidal pellets (

The results showed morphology as demonstrated by H&amp;E, the presence of glycosaminoglycans as demonstrated by toluidine blue and the presence of enrichment of sulphated proteoglycans as illustrated by alcian blue staining. The mRNA expression levels of chondrogenic-specific genes including SRY-related transcription factor 9 (Sox9) and Aggrecan (
