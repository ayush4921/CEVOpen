<p>Gene expression was quantified via real-time PCR analysis by using a real-time PCR cycler Rotor-Gene Q (Qiagen). The real-time PCR was performed in a reaction including template DNA, 900 nM of forward and reverse primers (both target and reference), 250 nM TaqMan probes (both target and reference) and 25 µl FastStartTaqMan Probe Master (Applied Biosystems) which consists of AmpliTaq Gold DNA Polymerase, AmpErase uracil N-glycosylase (UNG), dNTP with dUTP, and optimised buffer component, in a total volume of 50 µl. Thermal cycling conditions for amplification and detection of the samples and the standards were as follows: 50 °C for 2 min for activation of optical AmpErase UNG enzyme, 95 °C for 10 min as hot start to activate AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s, and annealing and extension at 60 °C for 1 min. For evaluation of real-time PCR data, the efficiency (e)(−ΔCt) method

 </xref> was applied, which is used to determine mRNA levels in gene expression compared to control group and reference gene β-actin. Analytical sensitivity was verified by running standard curves. In order to calculate the amplification efficiency (e), the formula e = 10 (−1/slope) was used based on the slopes of the curves (slope)
