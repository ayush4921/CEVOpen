<p>Tissue samples were taken by applying hypothermia to the zebrafish after 56 days of feeding. At the beginning and end of the experiment, three zebrafish in each experiment group were randomly selected in order to measure enzyme activity and gene expression levels. Liver, kidney and muscle samples were then transferred placed in sterile 2 ml eppendorf tubes and stored at −80 °C by adding RNA Later Stabilisation Regent solution (QIAGEN
