<p>Results were given as mean ± SD (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5). Each experimental unit (aquarium) was regarded as a replicate. Two fish from each aquarium were used for analysis of enzyme activity. In order to test the effect of royal jelly on enzyme activity and expression level, data were evaluated with one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and means were subsequently compared by Duncan’s multiple range tests. Activity and expression level of each enzyme was compared with independent 
 <italic>t</italic> test for each experimental group with those for initial fish. Differences at
