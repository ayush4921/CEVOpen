FJ807962.1), CAT (GenBank accession no. AF170069.1), GPx (GenBank accession no. AY216589.1) GR (GenBank accession no. NM_001020554) and GST (GenBank accession no. AF285098.1) sequences and BLASTed in order to verify correct mRNA sequences. 
 <italic>Î²</italic>-Actin (GenBank accession no. AF057040.1) was chosen as an appropriate reference gene due to not being affected by any of the treatments. Real time PCR was performed by conjugating TaqMan probe of the reference gene with Cy5/Blackhole Quencher 2, the fluorophore and quencher molecules. Conjugation of the probes for target genes were performed with FAM/TAMRA. The primer and probe sequences are given in
