<p>Total RNA of frozen liver tissues (50 mg) was isolated with a RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen, cat. no. 74804) using the Qiacube robot (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). In order to prevent genomic contamination, RNA was treated with DNase I. Quality and concentrations of RNA were verified using spectrophotometer (Nanodrop) and RNA gel electrophoresis, respectively. Subsequently, cDNA was synthesised using the ThermoScript™ RT-PCR System for First-Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. All cDNA was kept at −20 °C until use.</p>
