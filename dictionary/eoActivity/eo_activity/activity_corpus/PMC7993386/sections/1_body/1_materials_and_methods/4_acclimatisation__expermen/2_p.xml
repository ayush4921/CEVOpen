<p>A total of 250 fish, 10 (5♀, 5♂) for each of the 25 research tanks, were placed in the tanks. During the experiment, the fish were exposed to the photoperiod with the water temperature at 26 ± 1 °C and for 14 h of light and 10 h of dark. Fish were subjected to an acclimatisation period of two weeks. During this period, fish were fed with basal diet. Zebrafish in five different experimental groups were fed daily up to 1, 2, 5, 8 and 10% of their live weight during the first eight weeks of feeding studies. During the second 8 weeks of feeding, the zebrafish were fed 5% of their live weight gain. The feedings were repeated four times a day at 09:00, 12:00, 15:00 and 18:00.</p>
