<p>In order to investigate the mechanistic background of fish nutrition, it is necessary to have a full understanding of biochemical mechanisms that enable effective enzymatic catalysis under several nutritional conditions. In the literature, there is a lack of data on the biochemical outcomes of royal jelly feeding and no data has been received on its effects on zebrafish antioxidant system. Therefore, this study aimed to measure the effects of dietary royal jelly, which might be a novel source in animal feeding, on the activity and expression levels of antioxidant enzymes in muscle, kidney and liver tissues of zebrafish.</p>
