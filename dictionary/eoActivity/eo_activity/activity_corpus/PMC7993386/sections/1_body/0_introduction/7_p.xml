<p>Zebrafish (
 <italic>Danio rerio</italic>) lives mainly in Southeast Asia, the Ganges Region of East India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Myanmar. It exists more where water moves slowly (pools, ponds, lakes, canals and rice paddies). Zebrafish has been frequently used as a model organism in biological experiments. Advantages of zebrafish as a model organism are as follows; They are cheap, have sufficient resource accumulation, their biological stages are well known, they reproduce by external fertilisation and give many eggs under optimum conditions, they have easy maintenance under appropriate conditions, easy monitoring and manipulation of embryonic development, easy culture, they are also suitable for experimental manipulations in addition to having high homology with the human genome, and it is easy and convenient to study for genetic analysis
