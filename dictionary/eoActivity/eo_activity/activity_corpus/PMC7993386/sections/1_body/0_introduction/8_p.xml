<p>Aerobic tissues steadily produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) under physiological conditions, which are by products of oxidative metabolism

 </xref>. ROS generation may be useful in some specific cell types in order to fight a pathogen. Nevertheless, generally, high levels of ROS in a cell lead to several injuries like DNA damage, inactivation of enzymes, structural protein degradation and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) peroxidation that cause alteration of development and pathologies

 </xref>. Overcome of prooxidants against antioxidant defences is the cause of oxidative stress in cells. Diet composition can worsen this unbalance. Fish feeds, especially the ones for larvae include high amounts of PUFAs, which are fatty acids having tendency to create oxidative damage during diet preparation and storage. Since the products obtained from lipid peroxidation are absorbed and transported to tissues, oxidative stress may be induced

 </xref>. All aerobic organisms have two different systems for antioxidant defense to reduce ROS levels and avoid lipid peroxidation. One of them corresponds to enzymes which involve superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR) glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione S-transferase (GST). SOD is a metalloenzyme catalysing the dismutation of the superoxide anion (O
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>âˆ’</sup>) into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>)

 </xref>. Following this, CAT enzyme reduces H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> to water in the peroxisomes. Same reaction is catalysed by GPx as CAT in the cytosol. Additionally, GPx converts lipid hydroperoxides into a more stable form, which are lipid hydroxides. GR is responsible for conversion of oxidised glutathione (GSSG) to reduced form (GSH). In the reduced form, glutathione plays key roles in the cellular control of reactive oxygen species. GST is responsible for catalysing the conjugation of GSH to several xenobiotic substrates for the purpose of detoxification.
