<p>Several diets have been discovered in order to provide specific nutritional needs of different fish species. Although antioxidant features of royal jelly have been well established, diets including this antioxidant have been rarely analysed in fish. Our study aimed to constitute a relationship between royal jelly administration and oxidative stress enzymes in zebrafish both at transcriptional and activity levels. We have demonstrated that inclusion of royal jelly in zebrafish diets modulated both mRNA expression levels and activity of the enzymes in dose and tissue-dependent manner without significant correlations between gene expression and activities.</p>
