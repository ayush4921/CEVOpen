 </xref> investigated the effects of increasing concentrations of royal jelly on the viability, development time, body size, productivity, life cycle and large-scale genome transcription amounts of 
 <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. They reported that low concentrations of the royal jelly made significant differences in body size in both genders, while high concentrations decreased body size, increased mortality, shortened life cycle and decreased productivity. In addition, they found that royal jelly increased the development periods for both genders with increasing concentrations
