<p>In a study investigating the antioxidative effect of the royal jelly on 
 <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> yeast cells, the yeast used was enriched with royal jelly at two different ratios (1,2 and 5,0â€‰g/L) and developed in YEPD medium. At the end of the study, it was observed that royal jelly reduced intracellular oxidation in a dose-dependent manner and affected the metabolic activity related to the growth. It was also reported that royal jelly not only acts as a scavenger of reactive oxygen species but also affects protein expressions
