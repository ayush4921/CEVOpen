<p>There exist different fish feeding studies in the literature, but no studies have been done about royal jelly as a fish nutrient. Although there are many investigations on the effects of royall jelly on antioxidant enzyme activities, very limited research has been performed on both expression and activity of the enzymes. In fact, it is important for toxicologist and pharmacologists to see the influences on both mRNA levels and protein activity. Thus, our findings could make significant contributions for researchers interested in oxidative stress and feeding.</p>
