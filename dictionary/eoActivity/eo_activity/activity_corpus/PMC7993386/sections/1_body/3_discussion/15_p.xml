<p>In the muscle tissue, GST activity increased with supplementation of royal jelly in diets. The increase in GST activity caused a decline in GSH levels which might have resulted in downregulated activity of GPx, another GSH dependent enzyme. Moreover, downregulation of GPx activity might have caused deceleration of GSH-GSSG conversion which finally resulted in lower GR activities. The increase of the SOD activity in D2 and D3 groups is in parallel with CAT activity in the same diets. This might result from the elevation of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> levels produced by SOD reaction.
