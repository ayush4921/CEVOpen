<p>Our current study has interesting results. Expression levels of the antioxidant enzymes mostly elevated in royal jelly diets which in turn resulted in a transcriptional regulation. Activity of the enzymes also increased in some of the royal jelly groups compared to the control diet. However, no remarkable correlation was observed between expression levels and activities.</p>
