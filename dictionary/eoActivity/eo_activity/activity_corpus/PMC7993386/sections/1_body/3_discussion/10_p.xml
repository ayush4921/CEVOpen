<p>Zebrafish is a very suitable model organism for toxicological and nutritional studies, and oxidative stress investigations performed with this organism have gained great interest in the recent years. For instance, in a study to determine the effects of genetically modified plant sources, effects of genetically modified (GM) and non-GM maize diets on feed utilisation, growth and stress were investigated in zebrafish. When both maize sources were compared, it was observed that the growth rate of fish fed GM was higher, but SOD and HSP-70 mRNA expression levels were lower. They reported that effects of GM products differ depending on the gender, and statistically different levels of SOD mRNA were observed in male and female fish
