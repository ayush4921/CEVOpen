<p>In the liver tissue, activity of the enzymes mostly decreased in royal jelly diet groups except for increasing GST activity. This is also an interesting result indicating that detoxification by glutathione conjugation was stimulated in the liver after royal jelly supplementation and probably the detoxifitation products caused inhibition of other enzymes on active protein conformation. Moreover, in all tissues, enzyme activities mostly decreased in D5 group which has the highest royal jelly concentration. This might have resulted from feedback inhibition of the products. Overall results show that royal jelly alters both expression and activity of the antioxidant enzymes in dose and tissue-dependent manner.</p>
