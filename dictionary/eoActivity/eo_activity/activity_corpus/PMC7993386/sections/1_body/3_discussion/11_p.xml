<p>In a study, 4–6 weeks old zebrafish were used as model organism, and the role of Vitamin E (α-tocopherol) in foetal development was investigated. Fish were fed up to 1 year old with a control diet, α-tocopherol added diet (E+), non-added diet (E-). All groups showed similar growth rates. Vitamin E deficiency was determined to cause neurological damage in adult zebrafish. No variations were found in the expression of oxidative stress and apoptosis genes in their liver for all three diets. High rate of deaths at the 24th hour after fertilisation and anomalies and deaths at the 120th hour were detected in the embryos of the non-vitamin E (E-) group
