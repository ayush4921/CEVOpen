<p>In the kidney tissue, SOD activity significantly increased in royal jelly groups except for D5, which had the minimum activity even lower than control. Similar results were observed for CAT and GPx which indicates that H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2,</sub> produced by SOD, was metabolised successfully. GR activity also increased as expected because of the increasing GSSG concentrations produced by GPx and GST.
