<p>In another study conducted on rats, effectiveness of royal jelly on oxidative stress caused by fumonisins was investigated. Different diets, containing only fumonisin (FB), only royal jelly (RJ), and fumonisin and royal jelly (FB + RJ), were administered to 60 Sprague-Dawley male rats. SOD and GPx activities were significantly decreased in the FB administration compared to control. The activities of these enzymes were increased in the RJ diet compared to control. In the FB + RJ administration, the enzyme activities improved and approached to the control. It was determined that fumonisin caused a decrease in SOD and GPx enzyme activities and the royal jelly compensated this decrease, and it was concluded that oxidative stress caused by fumonisin was also eliminated
