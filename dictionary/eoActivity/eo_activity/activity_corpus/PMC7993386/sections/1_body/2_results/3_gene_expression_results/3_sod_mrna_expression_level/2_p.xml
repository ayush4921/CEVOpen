<p>SOD gene expression levels of muscle tissue were found to increase in D2, D3 and D4 groups compared to control with the highest increase in D4 group. However, mRNA level of D5 group was found to decrease compared to the control. In liver, while D2 group did not show a significant variation, mRNA levels of D3, D4 and D5 groups exhibited a significant increase, and the highest mRNA level was found in D3. In kidney, the changes in SOD expression levels of D2 and D4 diet groups were not significant compared to the control group while it was found to increase significantly in D3 and D5 groups (
