<p>In muscle, GST expression levels of D3, D4 and D5 groups increased significantly compared to control, and the highest mRNA level was shown to be in D4. However, D2 group did not show a significant change. In liver, GST mRNA levels of D3, D4 and D5 groups were found to increase compared to the control, and D4 group showed the highest level. Expression level of D2 group was lower than other groups with no significant difference from the control group. In kidney, the difference between the control group and D3 group was not found to be significant. However, the increase of mRNA level in D4 group was significant and the increase in D5 group was more than all diet groups (
