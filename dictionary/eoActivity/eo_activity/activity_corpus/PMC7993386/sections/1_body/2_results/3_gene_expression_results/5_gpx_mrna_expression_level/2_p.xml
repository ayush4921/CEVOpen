<p>GPx gene expression levels in muscle tissue were determined to decrease in D2 and D3 groups compared to control, and to increase in D4 and D5 groups. The maximum increase was seen in D4 group, while D3 diet group exhibited the lowest expression. In liver, mRNA levels of D3 and D4 groups were found to significantly decrease compared to the control group, while an increase was seen in D5 group, but no significant difference in D2 group. In kidney, the highest expression was detected in D2 group. However, mRNA levels of D3, D4 and D5 groups decreased compared to control, and minimum level was found in D4 group (
