<p>Gene expression levels in muscle tissue were determined to be increased in D3, D4 and D5 groups compared to control, and the highest increase in mRNA level was in D4 group. However, D2 group did not show a significant change compared to control. In liver, GR mRNA levels increased significantly in D3, D4 and D5 groups compared to control, while D2 did not show a significant difference. In kidney, an increase in D3 and D4 diet groups was detected compared to control, while D2 and D5 groups did not show a significant change (
