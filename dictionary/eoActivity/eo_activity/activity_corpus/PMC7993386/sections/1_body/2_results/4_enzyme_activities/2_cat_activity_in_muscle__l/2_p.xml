<p>In muscle, CAT activity of D2 and D3 diet groups were found to increase significantly compared to the control while activities in D4 and D5 groups were decreased. In liver, the highest CAT activity was determined in control group with an insignificant difference compared to D2 group. Enzyme activites of D3, D4 and D5 groups decreased compared to control and the lowest activity was in D5 group. In kidney, enzyme activities of D2, D3 and D4 groups significantly increased compared to control group. The lowest enzyme activity was found in D5 group with a statistically significant decrease from the control (
