In liver, D3, D4 and D5 groups showed a significant decrease compared to control, while the decrease in D2 group was not found to be statistically significant. Enzyme activities in all diet groups were decreased compared to control. In kidney, a decrease was detected in D2 group compared to control, while D3 and D4 groups showed significant increase.
