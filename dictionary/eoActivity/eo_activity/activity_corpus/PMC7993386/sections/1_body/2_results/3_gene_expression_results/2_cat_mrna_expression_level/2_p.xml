<p>CAT expression levels in D3, D4 and D5 groups were found to be significantly increased compared to the control group in muscle tissue. However, difference between D2 group and control was not statistically significant. In liver, CAT expression levels increased in D3, D4 and D5 groups compared to the control and the highest elevation was found in D4. The change in D2 group was not significant compared to the control. In kidney, expression levels of D3 and D4 groups were determined to increase compared to the control group, while the change in D2 and D5 groups was not significant (
