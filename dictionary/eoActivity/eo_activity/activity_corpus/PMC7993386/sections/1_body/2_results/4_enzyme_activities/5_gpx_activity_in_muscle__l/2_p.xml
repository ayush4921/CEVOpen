<p>In muscle tissue, GPx activity of D2 group increased compared to the control, which also have the highest enzyme activity among all groups compared to each other. This increase was statistically significant, while the increase in D4 group was not. D3 and D5 groups showed a significant decrease, and the lowest activity was found in D3. In liver, enzyme activities of all diet groups showed a significant decrease compared to control, and lowest activity was found in D3 group. In kidney tissue, D3, D4 and D5 groups showed a significant increase while D2 did not have a significant difference in GPx activity. The highest activity was detected in D4 group (
