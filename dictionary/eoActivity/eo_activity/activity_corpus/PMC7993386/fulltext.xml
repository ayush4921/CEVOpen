In the past, the term "Gelatine Reale", meaning royal-specific, was used for this substance, but today this term is used as "Royal Jelly (RJ)"<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref>. The royal jelly is secreted by the intracranial glands and pharynx glands of young worker bees to feed young larvae and adult queen bees.</p><p>The sugar content in royal jelly consists of a significant amount of glucose and fructose and a low level of sucrose. The glucose level in royal jelly is of great importance for the completion of muscle development in the larvae. The higher sugar level in royal jelly used for feeding young queen bee larvae enables queen bees to acquire stronger physical properties than other bee members. The carbohydrates found in royal jelly have a stimulating effect for nutritious bees and encourage more royal jelly production.</p><p>The quality of royal jelly is determined according to the 10-HDA ratio and this ratio is required to be between 1.4 and 1.8% in a qualified royal jelly. This ratio varies according to the vegetation of the region where the royal jelly is located and the applications in royal jelly harvesting<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref>. The royal jelly contains mostly K, Na, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn trace elements. Unlike honey, the mineral substance composition in the royal jelly is not affected much by the geographical origin and different plant variety<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref>.</p><p>The main ingredients of royal jelly are water, protein, carbohydrate, lipid and mineral salts. Although the composition of royal jelly varies according to geographical and botanical conditions, it generally contains an average of 60&#x02013;70% moisture, 12&#x02013;15% crude protein, 10&#x02013;16% sugar, 3&#x02013;6% lipid and low molecular weight compounds (vitamins, salts and free amino acids) and water-soluble protein fractions. Royal jelly is used for various purposes in traditional medicine, apitherapy, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries due to its strong biological activities. It has been reported that the antioxidative properties of the royal jelly have positive effects on human health against a number of diseases that may occur due to free radicals, especially cancer, coronary and inflammatory diseases, neurological degeneration and aging<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref>.</p><p>The unique feature of royal jelly is due to the C8-C12 hydroxy group and dicarboxylic fatty acids<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref>. It is known that 10-hydroxy-2-decanoic acid (10-HDA), the essential unsaturated fatty acid of royal jelly, has various pharmacological effects such as antibiotic<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref>, antitumoral<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref>, antioxidative<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> and hypoglycaemic activities<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref>. 10-HDA is used to distinguish and determine the freshness, quality and specificity of royal jelly. 9-hydroxy-2E-decanoic acid (9-HDA) in royal jelly can be considered as a metabolite of 9-oxo-2E-decenoic acid (9-ODA) produced by worker bees<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref>. This compound is a well-known semi-chemical that has important functions such as the recognition of the queen bee and the prevention of ovarian development of worker bees for the maintenance of the class system in honeybee colonies.</p><p>Zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) lives mainly in Southeast Asia, the Ganges Region of East India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Myanmar. It exists more where water moves slowly (pools, ponds, lakes, canals and rice paddies). Zebrafish has been frequently used as a model organism in biological experiments. Advantages of zebrafish as a model organism are as follows; They are cheap, have sufficient resource accumulation, their biological stages are well known, they reproduce by external fertilisation and give many eggs under optimum conditions, they have easy maintenance under appropriate conditions, easy monitoring and manipulation of embryonic development, easy culture, they are also suitable for experimental manipulations in addition to having high homology with the human genome, and it is easy and convenient to study for genetic analysis<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref>.</p><p>Aerobic tissues steadily produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) under physiological conditions, which are by products of oxidative metabolism<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref>. ROS generation may be useful in some specific cell types in order to fight a pathogen. Nevertheless, generally, high levels of ROS in a cell lead to several injuries like DNA damage, inactivation of enzymes, structural protein degradation and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) peroxidation that cause alteration of development and pathologies<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref>. Due to having high amounts of <italic>n</italic>-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA), fish are susceptible to both lipid peroxidation and tissue damage based upon lipid peroxidation<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref>. Overcome of prooxidants against antioxidant defences is the cause of oxidative stress in cells. Diet composition can worsen this unbalance. Fish feeds, especially the ones for larvae include high amounts of PUFAs, which are fatty acids having tendency to create oxidative damage during diet preparation and storage. Since the products obtained from lipid peroxidation are absorbed and transported to tissues, oxidative stress may be induced<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref>. All aerobic organisms have two different systems for antioxidant defense to reduce ROS levels and avoid lipid peroxidation. One of them corresponds to enzymes which involve superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR) glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione S-transferase (GST). SOD is a metalloenzyme catalysing the dismutation of the superoxide anion (O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>) into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref>. Following this, CAT enzyme reduces H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to water in the peroxisomes. Same reaction is catalysed by GPx as CAT in the cytosol. Additionally, GPx converts lipid hydroperoxides into a more stable form, which are lipid hydroxides. GR is responsible for conversion of oxidised glutathione (GSSG) to reduced form (GSH). In the reduced form, glutathione plays key roles in the cellular control of reactive oxygen species. GST is responsible for catalysing the conjugation of GSH to several xenobiotic substrates for the purpose of detoxification.</p><p>In order to investigate the mechanistic background of fish nutrition, it is necessary to have a full understanding of biochemical mechanisms that enable effective enzymatic catalysis under several nutritional conditions. In the literature, there is a lack of data on the biochemical outcomes of royal jelly feeding and no data has been received on its effects on zebrafish antioxidant system. Therefore, this study aimed to measure the effects of dietary royal jelly, which might be a novel source in animal feeding, on the activity and expression levels of antioxidant enzymes in muscle, kidney and liver tissues of zebrafish.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials" id="S0002" disp-level="1"><label>2.</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S0002-S2001" disp-level="2"><label>2.1.</label><title>Chemicals</title><p>All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany or Merck, Darmstadt, Germany with analytical grade.</p></sec><sec id="S0002-S2002" disp-level="2"><label>2.2.</label><title>Fish, maintenance and ethical approval</title><p>The experiment was conducted at the model organism unit and biotechnology laboratories at Agricultural Biotechnology Department of Ataturk University.

At the end of the study, it was observed that royal jelly reduced intracellular oxidation in a dose-dependent manner and affected the metabolic activity related to the growth. It was also reported that royal jelly not only acts as a scavenger of reactive oxygen species but also affects protein expressions<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref>.</p><p>In a study in which different proportions of the royal jelly were added to sheep sperm, were investigated the effects of royal jelly on the kinematics, plasma membrane, NO and antioxidant capacity of sperm samples taken at different time intervals (i.e., 0, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120&#x02009;h).

Different diets, containing only fumonisin (FB), only royal jelly (RJ), and fumonisin and royal jelly (FB&#x02009;+&#x02009;RJ), were administered to 60 Sprague-Dawley male rats. SOD and GPx activities were significantly decreased in the FB administration compared to control. The activities of these enzymes were increased in the RJ diet compared to control. In the FB&#x02009;+&#x02009;RJ administration, the enzyme activities improved and approached to the control. It was determined that fumonisin caused a decrease in SOD and GPx enzyme activities and the royal jelly compensated this decrease, and it was concluded that oxidative stress caused by fumonisin was also eliminated<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref>.</p><p>Guo et&#x000a0;al.<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> reported that royal jelly proteins hydrolysed with Protease N showed strong antioxidant activation against linoleic acid peroxidation.

For instance, in a study to determine the effects of genetically modified plant sources, effects of genetically modified (GM) and non-GM maize diets on feed utilisation, growth and stress were investigated in zebrafish. When both maize sources were compared, it was observed that the growth rate of fish fed GM was higher, but SOD and HSP-70 mRNA expression levels were lower. They reported that effects of GM products differ depending on the gender, and statistically different levels of SOD mRNA were observed in male and female fish<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref>.</p><p>In a study, 4&#x02013;6&#x02009;weeks old zebrafish were used as model organism, and the role of Vitamin E (&#x003b1;-tocopherol) in foetal development was investigated. Fish were fed up to 1&#x02009;year old with a control diet, &#x003b1;-tocopherol added diet (E+), non-added diet (E-). All groups showed similar growth rates. Vitamin E deficiency was determined to cause neurological damage in adult zebrafish. No variations were found in the expression of oxidative stress and apoptosis genes in their liver for all three diets. High rate of deaths at the 24th hour after fertilisation and anomalies and deaths at the 120th hour were detected in the embryos of the non-vitamin E (E-) group<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref>.</p><p>In another study on zebrafish; growth, survival rate and condition factors of fish fed for 9&#x02009;weeks with five different commercial diets and two different diets (prepared in the laboratory) were investigated.

While there was no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of condition factor, the survival rate was found to be the highest (with 100%) in the group fed commercial diet<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref>.</p><p>Since studies on the development of zebrafish diets may yield different results in feeding studies, it is recommended to develop novel diets. Furthermore, there is no study investigating the effect of the royal jelly on zebrafish diets. For this reason, our study is the first research on this subject.</p><p>Our current study has interesting results. Expression levels of the antioxidant enzymes mostly elevated in royal jelly diets which in turn resulted in a transcriptional regulation. Activity of the enzymes also increased in some of the royal jelly groups compared to the control diet. However, no remarkable correlation was observed between expression levels and activities.</p><p>In the muscle tissue, GST activity increased with supplementation of royal jelly in diets. The increase in GST activity caused a decline in GSH levels which might have resulted in downregulated activity of GPx, another GSH dependent enzyme. Moreover, downregulation of GPx activity might have caused deceleration of GSH-GSSG conversion which finally resulted in lower GR activities. The increase of the SOD activity in D2 and D3 groups is in parallel with CAT activity in the same diets. This might result from the elevation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels produced by SOD reaction.</p><p>In the kidney tissue, SOD activity significantly increased in royal jelly groups except for D5, which had the minimum activity even lower than control. Similar results were observed for CAT and GPx which indicates that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2,</sub> produced by SOD, was metabolised successfully. GR activity also increased as expected because of the increasing GSSG concentrations produced by GPx and GST.</p><p>In the liver tissue, activity of the enzymes mostly decreased in royal jelly diet groups except for increasing GST activity. This is also an interesting result indicating that detoxification by glutathione conjugation was stimulated in the liver after royal jelly supplementation and probably the detoxifitation products caused inhibition of other enzymes on active protein conformation. Moreover, in all tissues, enzyme activities mostly decreased in D5 group which has the highest royal jelly concentration. This might have resulted from feedback inhibition of the products. Overall results show that royal jelly alters both expression and activity of the antioxidant enzymes in dose and tissue-dependent manner.</p><p>There exist different fish feeding studies in the literature, but no studies have been done about royal jelly as a fish nutrient. Although there are many investigations on the effects of royall jelly on antioxidant enzyme activities, very limited research has been performed on both expression and activity of the enzymes. In fact, it is important for toxicologist and pharmacologists to see the influences on both mRNA levels and protein activity. Thus, our findings could make significant contributions for researchers interested in oxidative stress and feeding.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S0005" disp-level="1"><label>5.</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>Several diets have been discovered in order to provide specific nutritional needs of different fish species. Although antioxidant features of royal jelly have been well established, diets including this antioxidant have been rarely analysed in fish. Our study aimed to constitute a relationship between royal jelly administration and oxidative stress enzymes in zebrafish both at transcriptional and activity levels. We have demonstrated that inclusion of royal jelly in zebrafish diets modulated both mRNA expression levels and activity of the enzymes in dose and tissue-dependent manner without significant correlations between gene expression and activities.</p><p>It is crucial to improve feed quality of fish species in order to sustain the future of aquaculture because of the increasing demand. Therefore, it is important to perform more investigations on fish diets including natural products in order to obtain healthy, protective, easy access and more beneficial nutrients. Royal jelly represents a promising class of fish nutrient and results of our study may assist scientists to design novel fish diets with enhanced efficiency and other tailored properties.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="S0006" disp-level="1" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Disclosure statement</title><p>The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="CIT0001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><string-name><surname>Lannuzzi</surname>
