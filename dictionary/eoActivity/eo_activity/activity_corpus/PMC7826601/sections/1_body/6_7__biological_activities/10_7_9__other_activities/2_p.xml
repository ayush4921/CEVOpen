 <italic>Lagochilus</italic> species have been traditionally and ethnopharmacologically used to treat many diseases, such as hemorrhages, inflammation, allergies, skin diseases, and stomach pain. The phytochemical and biological results validate and support the ethnopharmacological use of 
 <italic>Lagochilus</italic> species in traditional medicine. Various chemical constituents have been isolated and identified in different groups of compounds, e.g., flavonoids, diterpenes, terpenoids, steroids, iridoids, polysaccharides, and other compounds. Diterpenes and flavonoids are the main bioactive compounds in 
 <italic>Lagochilus</italic> species, and a wide spectrum of biological studies have focused on these compounds. However, the biological effects of other compounds, such as terpenoids, steroids, iridoids, polysaccharides isolated from this genus, have mostly not been investigated. In certain cases, only plant extracts have been tested for biological activities. 
 <italic>Lagochilus</italic> species are a valuable medicinal resource with specific pharmacological activities 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies; however, more comprehensive studies on their pharmacokinetics, metabolism, side effects, and toxicity are required to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of plant extracts or bioactive compounds from this genus.
