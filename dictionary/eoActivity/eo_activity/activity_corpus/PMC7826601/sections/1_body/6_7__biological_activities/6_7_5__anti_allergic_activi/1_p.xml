 <italic>Lagochilus leiacanthus</italic> is a folk medicine used for the treatment of inflammation and ulcers in Xinjiang, China. Mast cells and basophils play a central role in allergic and inflammatory reactions. The β-hexosaminidase release from RBL-2H3 (rat basophilic leukemia) mast cells was measured as an indicator of the inhibitory activity against allergic reactions. In biological studies on the alcoholic extracts of the whole herb of this plant, Furukawa et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-plants-10-00132" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] found that the extract inhibits the release of β-hexosaminidase from RBL-2H3 cells. They also examined the inhibitory activity of the isolated compounds. Among the isolated compounds, flavanones 
 <bold>51–52</bold> and flavones 
 <bold>54</bold>, 
 <bold>56</bold>, 
 <bold>61</bold>, 
 <bold>65–67</bold> showed inhibition of β-hexosaminidase release more potently than ketotifen used as a positive control. It is worth mentioning that no work could be found regarding the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-allergic effect of 
 <italic>Lagochilus</italic> species, although most of these plants showed promising anti-inflammatory activity. This point might present a future point for many researchers.
