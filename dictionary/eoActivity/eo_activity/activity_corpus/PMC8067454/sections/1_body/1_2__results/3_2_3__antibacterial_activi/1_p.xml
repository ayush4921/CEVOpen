<p>To define the bactericidal and inhibitory activities of the investigated aromatic plants, microdilution assay, expressed as MIC (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) and MBC (Minimal Bactericidal Concentration) and agar diffusion method and vapor phase test expressed as mm of inhibition diameter of the halo for the liquid (IZ) and vapor phase (VIZ), respectively, were carried out. Furthermore MBC/MIC ratios, which consider an agent as bacteriostatic when the MBC/MIC ratio &gt; 4 and as bactericidal when the MBC/MIC ratio ≤ 4 [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-10-00707" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], were reported. In 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00707-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, 
 <italic>L. nobilis</italic> antibacterial activity against the tested bacterial strains is listed. EO showed MIC and MBC values of 3.13% against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic>, MIC value of 0.78% and MBC value of 1.56% against 
 <italic>A. bohemicus</italic>, MIC value of 1.56% and MBC value of 6.25% against 
 <italic>K. marina</italic>, and MIC and MBC values of 1.56% against 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic>. For all bacterial trains, MBC/MIC ratios were &lt; 4, confirming a bactericidal activity. Concerning the inhibition halos obtained by the agar diffusion method and by the vapor phase test, the EO IZs were 18.67 ± 2.31 mm against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 7.33 ± 0.58 mm against 
 <italic>A. bohemicus</italic> while, concerning the corresponding EO VIZ, no antibacterial activity was observed for both strains. On the contrary, EO activities against 
 <italic>A. bohemicus</italic>, 
 <italic>K. marina</italic> and 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> were observed for both liquid and vapor phase with the following inhibition halos diameter: 17.67 ± 2.31 mm, 24.67 ± 3.21 mm and 37.67 ± 2.08 mm for IZs, respectively and 45.67 ± 4.04 mm, 26.67 ± 2.52 mm and 47.33 ± 2.52 mm for VIZs, respectively. No activity was observed for 
 <italic>L. nobilis</italic> HY in the microdilution assay, agar diffusion method and vapor phase test.
