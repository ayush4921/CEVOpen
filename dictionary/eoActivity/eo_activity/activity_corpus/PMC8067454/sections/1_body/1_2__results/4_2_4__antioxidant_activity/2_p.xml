<p>The radical scavenging activity for 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> EO was calculated and IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were 14.10 ± 0.17 µg/mL and 43.64 ± 2.51 µg/mL, while the corresponding HY showed higher values (135.58 ± 33.32 µg/mL and 551.38 ± 17.33 µg/mL) for DPPH and ABTS assays, respectively. Furthermore, 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> EO showed TEAC values of 1.28 ± 0.00 mol/mg and 9.26 ± 0.55 mol/mg, while its HY showed TEAC values of 0.14 ± 0.03 mol/mg and 0.76 ± 0.02 mol/mg for DPPH and ABTS assays, respectively (
