<p>Chemical assays were used to determine the ability of the tested EOs and HYs to act as a scavenger of free radicals evaluating the decay of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2′-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS+•) radicals.

 <italic>L. nobilis</italic> essential oil showed the highest antioxidant activity with low IC
 <sub>50</sub> values (0.18 ± 0.04 µg/mL and 2.58 ± 0.08 µg/mL, respectively), while higher IC
 <sub>50</sub> values (218.10 ± 29.60 µg/mL and 391.38 ± 8.72 µg/mL, respectively) were reported for its HY. Confirming this, TEAC values (Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity) for 
 <italic>L. nobilis</italic> EO were high (92.97 ± 6.76 mol/mg and 158.49 ± 5.15 mol/mg) for DPPH and ABTS assays, respectively, while the HY exhibited lower values (0.08 ± 0.01 mol/mg and 1.19 ± 0.21 mol/mg, respectively) (
