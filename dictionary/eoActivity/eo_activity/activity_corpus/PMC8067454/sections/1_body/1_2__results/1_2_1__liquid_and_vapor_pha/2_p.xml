 <xref rid="plants-10-00707-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The chemical composition of EO was dominated by oxygenated monoterpenes (67.7% and 68.4%) followed monoterpenes hydrocarbons (19.1% and 31.4%) in the liquid and vapor phase, respectively. The main constituents of both phases were 1,8-cineole (30.3%, 48.4%), camphor (17.1%, 8.7%), α-thujone (9.7%, 7.0%), camphene (7.9%, 2.2%) and chrysanthenone (6.8%, 3.9%). β-Caryophyllene (0.1%) was the only sesquiterpene also detected in the vapor phase.
