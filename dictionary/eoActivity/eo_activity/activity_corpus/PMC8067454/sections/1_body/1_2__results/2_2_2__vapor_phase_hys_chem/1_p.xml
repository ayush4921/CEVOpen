<p>By HS-GC/MS analysis, the composition of the vapor phase of all HYs was described. Seven compounds were identified in 
 <italic>L. nobilis</italic> and in 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> and only two in 
 <italic>S. sclarea</italic>, and their percentage values are reported in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00707-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. 1,8-Cineole (65.1%, 61.4%) was the main compound in both 
 <italic>L. nobilis</italic> and 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> HYs, followed by α-thujone (11.1%) and camphor (22.5%) in the first and second HY, respectively. On the other hand, linalool (89.5%) and α-terpineol (10.5%) were the only two compounds detected in 
 <italic>S. sclarea</italic> HY. Sesquiterpenes compounds were missing in all the HYs (
