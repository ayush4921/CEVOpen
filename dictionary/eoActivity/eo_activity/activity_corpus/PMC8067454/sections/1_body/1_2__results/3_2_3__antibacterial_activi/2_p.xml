<p>In 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00707-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>, the treatment with 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> EO showed MIC and MBC values of 6.25% for 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic>, while MIC and MBC values were lower (0.39% and 0.78%, respectively) for 
 <italic>A. bohemicus.</italic> The antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>K. marina</italic> was 1.56% and 0.78% against 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> for both MIC and MBC values, respectively. MBC/MIC ratios defined the 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> EO as bactericidal against all bacterial strains (MBC/MIC &lt; 4). An agar diffusion method showed IZ diameters for liquid phase of 16.67 ± 1.53 mm, 8.00 ± 1.00 mm, 13.67 ± 1.53 mm, 38.33 ± 2.89 mm and 24.33 ± 3.06 mm against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic>, 
 <italic>A. bohemicus, K. marina</italic> and 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic>, respectively. In the vapor phase test 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> EO was active against 
 <italic>A. bohemicus</italic>, 
 <italic>K. marina</italic> and 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> with 21.67 ± 1.53 mm, 26.67 ± 1.15 mm and 23.00 ± 1.53 mm, respectively; null activity was found against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic>. As for 
 <italic>L. nobilis</italic> EO, 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> HYs were not active against the tested bacterial strains.
