<p>The results for 
 <italic>S. sclarea</italic> EO and HYs antibacterial activities are reported in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00707-t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>. MIC and MBC values for the EO were 12.50%, 1.56%, 6.25%, and 6.25% for 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic>, 
 <italic>K. marina</italic> and 
 <italic>B. cereus,</italic> respectively. MBC/MIC ratios defined the 
 <italic>S. sclarea</italic> EO as bactericidal against the sensible bacterial strains. 
 <italic>A. bohemicus</italic> was not affected by the 
 <italic>S. sclarea</italic> EO treatment. Inhibition halos were present in the treatment with 
 <italic>S. sclarea</italic> EO against 
 <italic>A. bohemicus</italic>, 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> and 
 <italic>K. marina</italic> with 12.67 ± 2.52 mm, 18.67 ± 0.58 mm and 10.67 ± 1.15 mm for liquid phase, while 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>A. bohemicus</italic> results were not affected. In the vapor phase test, 
 <italic>S. sclarea</italic> EO did not inhibit the bacterial growth for all the tested strains, and both the liquid and the vapor phase HY were not active.
