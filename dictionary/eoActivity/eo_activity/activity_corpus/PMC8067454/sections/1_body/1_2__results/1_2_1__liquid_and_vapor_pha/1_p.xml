<p>Liquid and vapor phase chemical composition of 
 <italic>L. nobilis</italic>, 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> and 
 <italic>S. sclarea</italic> was described by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) and Head-Space (HS)-GC/MS analysis. All components identified in 
 <italic>L. nobilis</italic> EO (26 in the liquid phase and 14 in the vapor phase) are reported in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00707-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. There was a prevalence of monoterpenes over sesquiterpenes which were missing in the vapor phase. In particular, 1,8-cineole was the most abundant compound (42.2%, 33.5%) followed by α-pinene (16.7%, 39.0%) and β-pinene (13.6%, 10.9%) in the liquid and vapor phase, respectively.
