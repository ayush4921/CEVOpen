<p>To our knowledge this is the first study on the liquid and vapor phase chemical characterization of 
 <italic>L. nobilis, S. officinalis</italic> and 
 <italic>S. sclarea</italic> EOs and their HYs carried out by the headspace-gas-chromatography/mass-spectrometry (HS-GC/MS) technique. The antibacterial activity of EOs and HYs was also investigated by microdilution and disc diffusion methods; furthermore, DPPH and ABTS assays were performed to evaluate their antioxidant activities.
