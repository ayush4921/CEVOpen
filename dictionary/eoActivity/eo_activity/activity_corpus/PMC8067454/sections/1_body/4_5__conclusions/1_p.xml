<p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work reporting the liquid and vapor phase chemical composition of 
 <italic>L. nobilis</italic>, 
 <italic>S. sclarea</italic> and 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> EOs from the Tuscany region (Italy) investigated by GC-MS and HS-GC/MS techniques to describe the volatile profile of the respective HYs by HS-GC/MS. The antibacterial activity was also evaluated by microdilution and the disc diffusion method, as well as the antioxidant activity by DPPH and ABTS assays. The tested EOs exhibited antibacterial and antioxidant activities, particularly 
 <italic>L. nobilis</italic> vapor phase, which determined the major inhibition halo. HYs showed to not be antibacterial at the tested concentrations, while the antioxidant properties were extremely low compared to that of the EOs. The obtained results show the potential use of EOs as possible natural antibacterial substances and sources of bioactive molecules. To assess HY biological properties further, tests will be run on other environmental bacterial strains. From a general point of view, our findings confirm the importance of bioactive plant molecules, and as a consequence it will be important to maintain productivity and stability of cultivated plants. In this view, in situ and ex situ conservation of the progenitors of domesticated plants, crop-wild relatives, become necessary, and the gene bank to maintain biodiversity should be improved [
