<p>Our biological assays, the microwell dilution method, agar diffusion method and vapor phase test, showed antibacterial activity of the investigated aromatic plants against the tested bacterial strains. 
 <italic>L. nobilis</italic> EO showed a high antibacterial activity with MIC values ranging from 0.78% to 3.13% and MBC values from 1.56% to 3.13%. For all bacterial strains the IZ halos were detected (from 37.67 ± 2.08 mm to 7.33 ± 0.58 mm) and the vapor phase proved to be even more active against 
 <italic>A. bohemicus</italic> (VIZ 45.67 ± 4.04 mm), 
 <italic>K. marina</italic> (VIZ 26.67 ± 2.52 mm) and 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> (VIZ 47.33 ± 2.52 mm). No VIZs were detected against the 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic>.
