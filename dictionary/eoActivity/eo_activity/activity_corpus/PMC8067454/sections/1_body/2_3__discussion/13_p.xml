<p>The chemical composition of different aromatic and medicinal herb EOs and their antimicrobial activities against human pathogenic bacteria were studied and a scale of antibacterial activities of their main compounds was defined; the linalyl acetate and linalool were active to a minor extent [

 <xref rid="B59-plants-10-00707" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The liquid and the vapor phase antibacterial activity reported in this study for 
 <italic>L. nobilis</italic>, 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> and 
 <italic>S. sclarea</italic> EOs was probably due to the synergistic action of their constituent compounds. In this regard, we assumed that the observed antibacterial action may be explained by the synergistic effect of the different components and/or by the presence of other active molecules, even in small amounts.
