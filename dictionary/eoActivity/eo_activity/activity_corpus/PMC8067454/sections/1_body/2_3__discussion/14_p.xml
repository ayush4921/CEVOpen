<p>The development of antibiotic resistant strains caused the failure of antibiotic therapies with serious consequences on animal and human health. The use of EOs as antibacterial agents opens the prospects for new molecules and new strategies to overcome the infectious; similarly, in crop production the use of such compounds could be an alternative to chemicals against various bacteria and fungi [
