<p>GC/MS and HS-GC/MS techniques were carried out to describe the chemical composition of EOs (liquid and vapor phase) and HYs. In particular, using the headspace autosampler, as carried out in this case, no solvent extraction process is necessary for the analysis of HYs. The chemical characterization of 
 <italic>L. nobilis</italic> EO showed a high eucalyptol content for both the liquid and vapor phase (30.4% and 48.4%) as well as in the HY (65.1%), and these data agreed with the reported values [
