<p>In regards to the antioxidant activity, 
 <italic>L. nobilis</italic> EO was characterized by low EC
 <sub>50</sub> values, 0.18 ± 0.04 µg/mL and 2.58 ± 0.08 µg/mL (DPPH and ABTS assays, respectively), which revealed a very high antioxidant power. 
 <italic>S. sclarea</italic> EO gave good results (7.79 ± 1.06 µg/mL and 2.26 ± 0.05 µg/mL) in both assays, respectively. Regarding 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic>, IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were slightly higher (7.79 ± 1.06 µg/mL and 2.26 ± 0.05 µg/mL for DPPH and ABTS, respectively) which correspond to lower antioxidant activity. Concerning the HYs, the obtained EC
 <sub>50</sub> values were remarkably high in the DPPH and ABTS assays which correspond to an extremely low antioxidant activity, as also obtained by expressing the values in TEAC.
