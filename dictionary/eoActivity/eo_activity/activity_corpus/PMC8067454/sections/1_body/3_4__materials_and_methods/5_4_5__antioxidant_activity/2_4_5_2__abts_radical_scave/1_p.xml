 <xref rid="B80-plants-10-00707" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>], with some variations. The working aqueous solution was made by mixing potassium persulfate (140 mM) with ABTS reagent (7 mM). The solution was kept for 16 h at room temperature in the dark. Before use, the ABTS+• solution was diluted in ethanol 100% to give an absorbance of 0.70 ± 0.02 at 734 nm. In total, 20 μL of each sample was added to 1980 μL of working solution; as a control, 20 μL of ethanol were used. Therefore, the obtained solutions were incubated for 5 min at room temperature and the absorbances were measured at 734 nm by a Jasco V-630 UV-Visible spectrophotometer and operating Spectra Manager™ software. The final values expressed as a percentage of inhibition against samples concentrations were likened against a standard curve of Trolox [
