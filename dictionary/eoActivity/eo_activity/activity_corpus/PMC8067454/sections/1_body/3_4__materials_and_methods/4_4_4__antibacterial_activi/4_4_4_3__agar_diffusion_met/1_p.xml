 <italic>S. sclarea</italic> EOs and HYs liquid and vapor phase were investigated, determining the diameter of the inhibition halo of the bacteria growth on agar petri dishes. Concerning the agar diffusion method, sterile disks (6 mm diameter, Oxoid), impregnated with 10 µL of samples, were placed on LB broth agar surface where the bacterial strains (approximately 10
 <sup>8</sup> Colony Forming Unit/mL—CFU/mL) had been sown. As a positive control, 2 µL of gentamicin (10 mg/mL) was used. The petri plates were incubated for 24 h at the corresponding growth temperature, and the diameter of the inhibition halos was recorded by a vernier caliper rule [
