<p>To examine the radical scavenging capacity of the 
 <italic>L. nobilis</italic>, 
 <italic>S. sclarea</italic>, 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> EOs and their HYs, a DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical) assay was used [
 <xref rid="B78-plants-10-00707" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. The working solution was made by mixing 3.9 mg of DPPH reagent with 50 mL of methanol. The assay was carried out in 96-well plates in which wells with 100 μL of 12 geometric dilutions in methanol of each sample were added to 100 μL of DPPH solution. As controls, geometric dilutions of the samples without DPPH, Trolox geometric dilutions and blank DPPH were also measured. The plates were incubated for 30 min in dark conditions. The absorbance decreases were measured at 517 nm using a Tecan Sunrise™ UV-vis spectrophotometer. DPPH radical scavenging capacity was considered by the following relationship:
