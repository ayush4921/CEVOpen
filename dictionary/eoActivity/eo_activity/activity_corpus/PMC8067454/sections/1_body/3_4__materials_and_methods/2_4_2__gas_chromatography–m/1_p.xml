<p>To describe the chemical composition of the EOs, a gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector (FID) directly coupled to a mass spectrometer (MS) Perkin Elmer Clarus 500 model (Waltham, MA, USA) was used. The GC was equipped with a Varian Factor Four VF-1 capillary column. Helium was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The injector was set to a 280 °C and the oven temperature program was as follows: from 60 °C ramped up to 220 °C at a rate of 6 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup>, and finally isothermal at 220 °C for 20 min. For liquid injections, 1 μL of each EO was diluted in 1 mL of methanol and 1 μL of the solution was injected. The Electron Impact-Mass Spectrometer (EI-MS), mass spectra were recorded at 70 eV (EI) and were scanned in the range 40–500 m/z. Ion source and the connection parts temperature was 220 °C. The GC-TIC mass spectra were obtained by the TurboMass data analysis software (Perkin Elmer). The identification of components was performed by matching their mass spectra with those stored in the Wiley and NIST 02 mass spectra libraries database. Furthermore, the linear retention indices (LRIs), (relative to C8–C30 aliphatic hydrocarbons, injected in the column at the same operating conditions described above) were calculated and compared with available retention data present in the literature. Relative percentages of all identified components were obtained by peak area normalization from GC-FID chromatograms without the use of an internal standard or correction factors and were expressed in percentages. All analyses were performed three times.
