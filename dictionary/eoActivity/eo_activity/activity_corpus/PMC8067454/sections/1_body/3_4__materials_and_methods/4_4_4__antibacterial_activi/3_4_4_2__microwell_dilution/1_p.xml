<p>To screen antimicrobial activities of EOs and their corresponding HYs, Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) was carried out according to the microwell dilution method in triplicate. All the matrices were diluted in LB broth (from 6.25% to 0.003%). DMSO controls, growth controls without treatments, positive controls with gentamicin (100 µg/mL to 0.049 µg/mL) and sterility controls without bacteria were added to 96 microwell plates. Bacteria at 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL were added to each well, except to the sterility control, and were two-fold diluted. The microplates were incubated for 24 h at the corresponding growth temperature. The visualization of the bacterial growth was observed by adding 20 µL of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (200 µg/mL, MTT) to each well [
