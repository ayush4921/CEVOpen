<p>The antibacterial activity of the vapor phases was evaluated by the disk volatization method. LB agar was poured into Petri plates where each bacterial suspension (10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL) was plated once it had solidified. A lower amount of agar was poured into Petri plate cover where 6 mm sterile disks had been placed and soaked with 10 ÂµL of the EOs and the corresponding HYs. To seal the Petri plates in order to prevent any vapor leakage, liquid agar was added in the space between the cover and the base. The Petri plates were incubated for 24 h in the upside-down position at the bacterial growth temperature. The inhibition halos were measured by a vernier caliper rule. Negative controls were carried out without the essential. Agar diffusion method and VPTs were carried out in triplicate for each bacterial strain; the means and the respective standard deviations (SD) of the measured halo were reported [
