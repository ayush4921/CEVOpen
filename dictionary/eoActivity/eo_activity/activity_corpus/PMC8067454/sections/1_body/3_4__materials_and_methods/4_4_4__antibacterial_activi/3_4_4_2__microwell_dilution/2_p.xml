<p>Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) was carried out. Plated 10 µL of the last four dilutions from the microwell dilution method in which no bacteria growth was observed on LB agar following 24 h of incubation. The MBC value was determined by an antibacterial agent concentration for which no growth on agar was observed. The assay was carried out in triplicate. To determine the activity of the EOs and the corresponding HYs, the MBC/MIC ratio was reported. The ratio MBC/MIC &gt; 4 reveled bacteriostatic activity, while the ratio MBC/MIC ≤ 4 revealed bactericidal activity for the tested antimicrobial agent [
