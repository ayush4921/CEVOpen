<p>Antioxidant effect of phenolic acids is closely related to their chemical structure. The amount of hydroxyl groups and their position in the aromatic ring determines their activity. The strongest of these, are acids which substituents are in ortho- or para- position. Introduction of the group of electrons’ donor in the ortho- position, alkyl or methoxyl, increases the stability of the antioxidant properties of phenolic acids [

The content of this acid depended on the harvest date and drying method. A much greater amount of this compound was found in infusions and extracts obtained from sage leaves harvested in July and dried at 35 °C. Although ferulic acid is less active, its concentration is significantly higher compared to the content of sinapinic or
