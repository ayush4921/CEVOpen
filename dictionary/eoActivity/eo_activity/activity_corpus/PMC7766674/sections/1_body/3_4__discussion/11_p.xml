<p>The polyphenol composition for some 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> L. species was also analyzed by Hanganu et al. [
 <xref rid="B50-materials-13-05811" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. They determined the composition of the ethanolic extract obtained from aerial parts of plants. As in the 
 <italic>Bona</italic> variety analyzed in our study, they found that the polyphenol profile for Salvia L contains common components. These are caffeic acid, 
 <italic>p</italic>-cumaric acid, as well as other rare compounds such as ferulic acid, rutin, and quercetin. All studied species of sage contain significant amounts of polyphenolic compounds and may constitute an important source of natural antioxidants.
