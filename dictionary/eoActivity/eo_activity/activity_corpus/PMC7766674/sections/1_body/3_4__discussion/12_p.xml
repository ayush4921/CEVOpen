<p>When preparing extracts and infusions, the harvest period and drying methods of leaves should be considered. Drying in natural conditions resulted in better antioxidant properties of sage leaves compared to material dried at 35 °C (higher values of FRAP and DPPH), whereas total polyphenol content was greater in samples dried at higher temperature. Obtained values may be the result of transformations in phenolic compounds that may occur under elevated temperatures or formation of new compounds that react with Folin’s reagent. The effect of harvest time on these properties was also observed. The harvest carried out in July resulted in an increase in the antioxidant capacity of the test material and also had a positive effect on the polyphenol content.</p>
