<p>In the tested samples it was also discovered that the extracts and infusions contained flavanols (catechin) and flavonols (rutin, quercetin). Bioavailability of flavonols also depends on their chemical structure. Quercetin and its glycosides have the highest absorption rate among the polyphenolic compounds tested [

 <italic>Bona</italic>, the quercetin content was higher in extracts from sage leaves than in infusions. It was observed that higher amounts of this compound were found in leaves harvested in June.
