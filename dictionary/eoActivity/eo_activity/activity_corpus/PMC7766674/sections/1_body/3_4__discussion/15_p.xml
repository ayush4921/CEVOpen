<p>Most of the identified polyphenols were present in both extracts and infusions obtained when drying the leaves at 35 Â°C (3.5-dCQA, sinapinic acid, 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid, isorhamnetin and catechin). The remaining polyphenols, i.e., ferulic acid, hesperidin and rutin, were found in greater amounts in the extracts obtained from naturally dried leaves. This observation may be important when planning the extraction of these compounds from plant matter.
