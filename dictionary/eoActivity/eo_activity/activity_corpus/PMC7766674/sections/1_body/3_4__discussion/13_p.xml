 <xref rid="B52-materials-13-05811" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], who similarly received the maximum content of essential oils in medical sage in July. In the cited studies, the analyzes were carried out over four months from June to September. Bettaieb et al. [
 <xref rid="B53-materials-13-05811" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] found that moderate water scarcity may be a factor increasing the content of essential oils in medical sage. The average rainfall in the analyzed period in July was 27.2 mm, while in June it was 213.1 mm. Moreover, the average daily temperatures in the studied months differed. July was characterized by a higher average temperature (19.4 °C) compared to June (17.5 °C), which may also be a factor increasing the content of essential oils.
