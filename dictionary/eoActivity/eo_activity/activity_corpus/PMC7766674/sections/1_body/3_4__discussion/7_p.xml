<p>Studies conducted on ferulic acid have shown that this compound has a very strong antioxidant activity, as well as it shows capability to enhance activity of enzymes that neutralize free radicals, and inhibiting the activities of enzymes involved in their catalysis [

 <xref rid="B47-materials-13-05811" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Due to the high ferulic acid content in the extracts obtained from second harvest, it can be assumed that this compound could promote the increase in FRAP and DPPH values. Caffeic acid derivatives such as 3,5-dCQA have strong antiviral properties [
