<p>Antioxidant activity of the infusions expressed as FRAP values was statistically significantly lower (276 ± 45 mM Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>/L in June, 265 ± 17 mM Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>/L in July, drying natural) than the antioxidant activity of extracts determined by the same method (381 ± 64 mM Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>/L in June, 496 ± 21 mM Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>/L in July, drying natural). There were no significant changes observed in the FRAP values for the infusions obtained. The value of the measured parameter in the case of infusions was not affected by the method of drying. The samples collected in June and July had comparable value of the measured parameter FRAP, regardless of the drying method. (
