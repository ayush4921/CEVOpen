<p>In the case of the assessment of the ability to reduce the pool of free radicals expressed as DPPH, it was found that in extracts obtained from leaves harvested in June and July the DPPH values were significantly higher than in the infusion obtained from leaves harvested in June and dried at 35 °C. (56.2 ± 10.0% vs. 24.3 ± 5.2%). This statistically significant increase in DPPH value between the extracts and the infusion obtained from leaves harvested in June and dried at 35 °C was observed in the extracts regardless of the method of drying the plant material.</p>
