 <xref rid="materials-13-05811-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. FRAP values for methanol-acetone extracts obtained from sage leaves harvested in July dried naturally and at 35 °C were statistically significantly higher than for extracts from June harvest (naturally: July 496 ± 21 mM Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>/L vs. June 381 ± 64 mM Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>/L, and dried at 35 °C July 436 ± 10 mM Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>/L vs. June 300 ± 26 mM Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>/L). Moreover, the FRAP values in the case of extracts obtained from naturally dried leaves from June and July were higher than in the case of extracts obtained from leaves dried at 35 °C
