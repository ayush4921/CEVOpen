<p>In extracts obtained from leaves dried at 35 °C a statistically significant increase in the TPC parameter was observed in the July harvest (17.1 ± 7.1 mg GAE/g DW vs. 12.4 ± 6.1 mg GAE/g DW) as well. Based on the obtained results, it can be assumed that the July harvest, regardless of the drying method, contains statistically significantly more polyphenolic compounds.</p>
