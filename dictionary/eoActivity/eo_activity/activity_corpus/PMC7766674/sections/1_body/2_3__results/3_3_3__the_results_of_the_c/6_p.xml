<p>The content of ferulic acid in the extracts was influenced by the time of leaf harvesting and drying methods. Increased amounts were observed in samples of extracts obtained from leaves harvested in July and naturally dried. The harvest time influenced the content of this acid in the infusions, but the drying method was not significant. In the case of hesperidin, its content was higher in the extracts obtained from the July harvest, but the content of this compound in the infusions depended on the drying method, and was significantly higher in the case of drying leaves at 35 Â°C.</p>
