<p>It was found that a significant factor influencing the content of 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid (3,5-dCQA) in the extracts and infusions was the harvest time. Higher concentration of this compound was determined in the material coming from second harvest. A significant amount of this acid was assayed in extracts made from leaves dried at 35 Â°C in comparison to extracts prepared from sage leaves dried in natural conditions.</p>
