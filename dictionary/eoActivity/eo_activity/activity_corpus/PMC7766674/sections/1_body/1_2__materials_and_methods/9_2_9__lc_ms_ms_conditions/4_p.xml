<p>The dwell time that the mass spectrometer operated with was 200 ms. For each compound, the dominant production’s multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) was performed at optimal conditions. Ion source parameters were: nebulizer gas: 30 psi; ion spray voltage (IS): −4200 V; turbo gas: 10 psi; curtain gas: 20 psi; temperature of the heated nebulizer: 350 °C. Following the optimization of individual compounds, the parameters of ion path were obtained, which are presented in 
 <xref rid="materials-13-05811-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The following are included among the parameters: focusing potential (FP): 200 V; collision cell entrance potential (CEP): 0 V; decluttering potential (DP): 20 V; entrance potential (EP): 10 V; collision cell exit potential (CXP): 2 V [
