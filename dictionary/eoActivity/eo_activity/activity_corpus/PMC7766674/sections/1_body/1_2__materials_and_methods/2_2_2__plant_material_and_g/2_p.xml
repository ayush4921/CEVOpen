<p>The experiment was carried out on a soil with a granulometric composition of strong loamy sand (16â€“20% the floatable fraction). During the vegetation season, no hydration or any pesticides were used (the type of fertilization has already been given). No pesticides were used, only fertigation with a 0.2% solution of Kristallon, a multi-constituent fertilizer with micronutrients, in the middle of April was performed. In Kristalon fertilizer the percentage of N: P: K is the same and amounts to 18: 18: 18. This fertilizer is enriched with magnesium and sulfur with 3% MgO and 2% S. Therefore, fertilization with these macronutrients was: 0.36 g N, 0.36 g P
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>5</sub>, 0.36 g K
 <sub>2</sub>O, 0.06 g MgO and 0.04 g S for each sage bush. This was an equivalent to fertilizing under each bush in the amount of 0.36 g, calculated as pure N, P
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>5</sub>, K
 <sub>2</sub>O and 0.06 g MgO and 0.04 g S.
