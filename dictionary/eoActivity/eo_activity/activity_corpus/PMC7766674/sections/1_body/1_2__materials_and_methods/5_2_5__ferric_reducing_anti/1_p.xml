<p>The ability to reduce Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> ions to Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> ions in acidic environment (pH 3.6) was measured in the obtained extracts and infusions. For this purpose, the FRAP test was used, which was a modification of the Benzie and Strain’s [
 <xref rid="B17-materials-13-05811" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> ions in the presence of 2,4,6-tripirydylo-S-triazyne (TPTZ) forms Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>-TPTZ complexes of an intense blue color and maximum absorbance at 593 nm. For the assay, 1 mL of the reaction mixture was used, including 0.3 M acetate buffer (pH 3.6); TPTZ 0.01 M; iron (III) chloride 0.02 M. To such volume of the reaction mixture 50 µL of the tested extract or infusion was added. It was mixed, and incubated at 37 °C in water bath for 30 min. After this time in the samples, the absorbance at λ = 593 nm was measured using a JASCO V-530-MEDSON spectrophotometer, Tokyo, Japan. A blank test was performed similarly, but 50 µL of distilled water was added to the reaction mixture. The standard curve was linear for the Trolox concentration ranging from 0.003125 to 1 mmol. The antioxidant activity is expressed as millimoles of ferrous ions per liter (mM Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>/L). Measurements were carried out in triplicate.
