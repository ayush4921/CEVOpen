<p>The chromatographic separation was performed in the gradient mode with a Thermo Scientific BDS HYPERSIL C18 column (100 nm × 3 mm I.D., 3 µm particle size) (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The advance column, with a precolumn (10 mm × 3 mm I.D., 3 µm particle size), was set at 25 °C and a mobile phase flow rate was 0.5 mL/min. The gradient elution mobile phases consisted of 0.02 M formic acid in water (phase A) and 0.02 M formic acid in acetonitrile (phase B). The gradient began initially at 2% A in 5 min, increasing linearly to 6%, for next 22 min to 60%, then decreased to 40% at 5 min and next 5 min increased to 100% and then decreased to 2% at 2 min. Finally, the last 8 min of analysis was kept at 2% to stabilize the baseline.</p>
