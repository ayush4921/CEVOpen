<p>In order to check whether the analyzed factors have an impact on the observed variables, a three-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed sequentially for each dependent (explained) variable. The dependent variables were: FRAP [mM Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>/L], DPPH [%], TPC [mg GAE/g DW]. The intergroup factors (independent variables) were: Harvest term (two levels: June, July), Drying method (two levels: naturally dried, dried at 35 Â°C), and Solution (two levels: extract, infusion).
