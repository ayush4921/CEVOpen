<p>The sample temperature was maintained at 4 °C in the autosampler prior to analysis. Quantification of the analysis was performed using the tandem electrospray MS in a negative mode (ESI
 <sup>−</sup>). To find the optimal parameters of the ion path and ion source of the studied compound, the quantitative optimization was done by direct infusion of the standards (at concentration of 1 µg/mL and the flow rate of 10 µL/min) using a Hamilton syringe pump (Hamilton, Reno, NV, USA). MS/MS analysis allowed recording of production spectra, monitoring each precursor [M-H
