<p>In order to assess the influence of controlled experimental factors on the values of dependent variables (describing the results of the experiment), it is necessary to use statistical inference methods.

The null hypothesis is that the observed difference is entirely due to natural variability. The alternative hypothesis states that this is the result of an experiment [
