<p>The antioxidant properties of the investigated extracts and infusions were measured with the DPPH test based on the method described by Akter et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-materials-13-05811" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Generally, DPPH in its stable radical form absorbs at 517 nm, but its absorption ability decreases when reduced by the antioxidant present in the sample. A 0.6 mM solution of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) was prepared in methanol. Samples (extracts and infusion) diluted 1: 5 were prepared before the assay. A fixed volume (25 µL) of each extract or infusion sample to be tested was added to 1 mL of DPPH. The solutions were mixed and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. After that time the absorbance of samples were measured at 517 nm (

 <italic>Ab</italic>). As a control, absorbance of DPPH solution with 25 µL of distilled water was measured (
 <italic>Ac</italic>). The capability of tested compounds to scavenge the DPPH radical (antioxidant activity) was calculated using the following equation:
