 <p id="Par1">The potential of utilizing 
  <italic>Onopordum acanthium</italic> essential oil and its major constituents as environment friendly herbicides was investigated. In total 29, 25, and 18 compounds were identified from flower, leaf, and stem oils, representing 94.77%, 80.02%, and 90.74% of the total oil, respectively. Flower and stem oils were found to be rich in 
  <italic>n</italic>-alkanes, which accounted for 57.33% in flower oil, and 82.33% in stem oil. Flower oil exerted potent inhibitory activity on both receiver species, 
  <italic>Amaranthus retroflexus</italic> and 
  <italic>Poa annua</italic>, which nearly completely suppressed seed germination at 5 mg/mL, and β-eudesmol is the most likely responsible compound for its phytotoxicity; in comparison, leaf and stem oils exhibited much weaker inhibitory activity on 
  <italic>A. retroflexus</italic>, and stimulatory effect on 
  <italic>P. annua</italic> when tested concentration was below 2.5 mg/mL. Alkanes in the oils were found to exert relatively weak plant growth regulatory activity. This report is the first on the chemical profile and phytotoxic action of 
  <italic>O. acanthium</italic> oil as well as the phytotoxicity of β-eudesmol.
