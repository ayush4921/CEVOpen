<p id="Par20">GC/MS was performed to determine the chemical constituents of 
 <italic>O. acanthium</italic> oil using a 7890A/5975C GC–MS system with an automatic injector (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with FID and a DB-5MS 5% Phenyl Methyl Silox column (30 m × 0.25 mm; film thickness 0.25 μm). The experimental conditions were programmed as follows: Helium (carrier gas) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min; the temperature of the oven was first maintained at 60 °C for 5 min, then programmed from 60 to 280 °C at a rate of 3 °C/min; injector and detector temperature: 280 °C; sample injection volume: 0.1 µL (the sample was first diluted in hexane at high-performance liquid chromatography grade at 1:100, v/v); split ratio: 50:1; mass spectra were taken at 70 eV with mass range from m/z 40–800 amu. Identification of essential oil constituents was achieved based on comparison of their mass spectra and retention indices (RI, calculated by linear interpolation relative to retention times of a standard mixture of C7–C40 
 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes at the same chromatographic conditions s) with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST 14) library database and a home-made library obtained from genuine compounds, as well as those given in the published literature

 </sup>. Relative amounts of individual constituents were calculated based on GC peak areas without using correction factors.
