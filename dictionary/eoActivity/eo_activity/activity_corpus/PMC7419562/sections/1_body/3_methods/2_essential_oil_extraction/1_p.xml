<p id="Par19">Essential oils were obtained by performing traditional boiling hydrodistillation procedure. Fresh flowers, leaves, and stems of 
 <italic>O. acanthium</italic> (200 g were used for each plant organ) were laid out in the flask containing water and the unit is carried to boiling for 4 h. The mixture of water–oil was produced in the flask then condensed in the condenser, where the oils were harvested. The same procedure was repeated until enough oils were obtained for GC/MS analysis and the phytotoxic activity assay. The essential oils were dried over anhydrous Na
