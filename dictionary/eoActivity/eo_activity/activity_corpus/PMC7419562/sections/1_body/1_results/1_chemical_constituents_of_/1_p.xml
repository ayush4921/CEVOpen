<p id="Par5">Essential oils were extracted from fresh flowers, leaves, and stems of 
 <italic>O. acanthium</italic> using hydrodistillation method. The phytochemical profiles of the essential oils obtained from different plant organs were analyzed via GC/MS, and the results were presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. In total, 29, 25, and 18 compounds were identified from flower, leaf, and stem oils, representing 94.77%, 80.02%, and 90.74% of the total oil mass, respectively. All these oils were found to be rich in a type of particular compounds-
 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes (mainly C22–C29), such as tricosane, tetracosane, pentacosane, hexacosane, heptacosane, octacosane, nonacosane, etc., especially in flowers and stems, which accounted for 57.33% in the flower oil, and 82.33% in the stem oil. The major components of flower, leaf and stem oils differed significantly: pentacosane (12.41%), hexacosane (10.44%), β-eudesmol (10.10%), heptacosane (8.67%), tetracosane (8.43%), and tricosane (5.36%) were dominant in flower oil; leaf oil contain 1-Hexanol (14.88%), 3-Hexen-1-ol, (E)- (13.53%), 2-Hexen-1-ol, (E)- (12.18%), 2-Hexenal, (E)- (6.93%), nonanal (9.74%); on the other hand, stem oil was rich in nonacosane (16.44%), nonacosane, 2-methyl- (15.54%), hentriacontane (15.05%), and dotriacontane (13.73%).
