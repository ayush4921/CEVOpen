<p id="Par10">Phytotoxic assay demonstrated that the strength of flower oil was much higher than leaf and stem oils; further comparison revealed that flower oil was abundant in a unique compound, β-eudesmol. It is thus speculated that this compound might be responsible for the phytotoxic activity of the flower oil. To testify this hypothesis, the phytotoxic activity of β-eudesmol was further evaluated, and the results showed that indeed it possessed the same biological activity comparable to the flower oil (Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Starting from the lowest concentration, 0.25 mg/mL, over 50% reduction of root and shoot growth of both receiver plants were observed: root length was reduced by 79.46% and 63.34% for 
 <italic>A. retroflexus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. annua</italic>, and shoot length was suppressed by 60.37% and 68.96%, respectively. When the concentration was doubled to 0.5 mg/mL, seedling growth was nearly completely inhibited, and further increase in the dose resulted in 100% death of the seeds. The content of β-eudesmol was 10.16% in the total oil, therefore, if β-eudesmol was the only constituent responsible for the phytotoxicity of the oil, the phytotoxicity of 0.25 mg/mL β-eudesmol should be similar to 2.5 mg/mL oil, whilest 0.5 mg/mL β-eudesmol equals to the activity triggered by 5 mg/mL oil. In the assay, 0.25 mg/mL β-eudesmol caused 79.46% and 63.34% root reduction of 
 <italic>A. retroflexus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. annua</italic>, compared with 75.49% and 59.72% affected by flower oil at 2.5 mg/mL. Meanwhile, 0.5 mg/mL β-eudesmol caused 98.81% and 100% inhibition rate on root elongation of 
 <italic>A. retroflexus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. annua</italic>, compared with 99.6% and 100% on test species. In terms of shoot development, 0.25 mg/mL β-eudesmol caused 60.37% and 68.96% reduction of 
 <italic>A. retroflexus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. annua</italic>, compared with 71.31% and 60.20% of reduction under 2.5 mg/mL flower oil treatment; meanwhile, 0.5 mg/mL β-eudesmol reduced shoot elongation by 97.41% and 100%, compared with 99.43% and 98.76% triggered by 5 mg/mL flower oil. Thus, it was concluded that the single compound β-eudesmol was most likely the active responsible compound for the strong phytotoxicity of flower oil.
