<p id="Par7">Although leaf and stem oils also exhibited negative impact on root growth of 
 <italic>A. retroflexus</italic>, the strength was much weaker. Root length decreased to 6.89–33.66% of control when treated with leaf oil ranging from 0.25–5 mg/mL, and 9.15–26.28% with stem oil. It was obvious that strength of the oils’ phytotoxicity was much weaker compared with the commercial herbicide glyphosate, which reduced root length by 71.22%, 78.75%, 91.94%, 95.66% and 96.20% at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 mg/mL, respectively. Shoot development of 
 <italic>A. retroflexus</italic> responded to the oils in a similar way, however both leaf and stem oils promoted shoot length by 3.91% and 5.91%, respectively (Figs.
