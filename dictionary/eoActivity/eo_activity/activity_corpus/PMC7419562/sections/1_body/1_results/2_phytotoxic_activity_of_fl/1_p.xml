<p id="Par6">Flower, leaf, and stem oils (concentration tested ranged from 0.25–5 mg/mL) all exhibited significant plant growth regulatory activity against both receiver species (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The oils posed inhibitory activity on root development of the dicot plant, 
 <italic>A. retroflexus</italic>, with flower oil being the most potent oil, suppressing root elongation by 12.92% and 14.25% at 0.25 and 0.5 mg/mL. When the concentration of flower oil was increased to 1 mg/mL, the inhibitory effect was enhanced markedly, reaching 54.3% compared with the control. The suppressive effect was enhanced to 75.49% by 2.5 mg/mL oil, meanwhile 5 mg/mL flower oil almost completely killed the seedlings (99.60%).
