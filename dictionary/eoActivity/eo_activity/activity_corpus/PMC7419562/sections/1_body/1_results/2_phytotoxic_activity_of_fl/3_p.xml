<p id="Par8">Flower oil exhibited similar inhibitory activity on 
 <italic>P. annua</italic>, which was also much more sensitive to flower oil than leaf and stem oils. Root length was reduced to 49.75% and 59.72% of the control when treated with flower oil at 1 mg/mL and 2.5 mg/mL, respectively, and 5 mg/mL almost completely prohibited seed germination of 
 <italic>P. annua</italic> (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Similarly, glyphosate presented much stronger phytotoxic effect, inhibiting root elongation by 79.08% and 93.44% at 0.25 and 0.5 mg/mL, respectively, and starting from 1 mg/mL, seedling development was completely prohibited. On the other hand, leaf and stem oils promoted root development except the highest concentration tested (5 mg/mL), which reduced root length by 12.05% and 0.98%; leaf and stem oils stimulated root elongation by 8.13–22.11% and 4.14–14.41%, respectively. Like 
 <italic>A. retroflexus</italic>, shoot growth of 
 <italic>P. annua</italic> also displayed the same pattern as root growth (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).
