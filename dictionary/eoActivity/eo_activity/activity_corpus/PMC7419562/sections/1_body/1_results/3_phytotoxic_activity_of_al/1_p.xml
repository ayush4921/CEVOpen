<p id="Par9">The essential oils produced by 
 <italic>O. acanthium</italic> were rich in various alkane compounds, especially the flower and stem oils. Therefore, their possible involvement of the plant regulatory activity was assessed. In general, alkanes as the major constituents of the essential oils possessed relatively weak plant growth regulatory activity on receiver species. In terms of 
 <italic>A. retroflex</italic>, alkanes stimulated root elongation by up to 26.97% (tetracosane at 0.25 mg/mL) when the applied concentration was between 0.25–0.5 mg/mL, and the strongest inhibitory effect (13.12%) was observed when the mixture of different alkanes were mixed at 5 mg/mL (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). For 
 <italic>A. retroflex</italic> shoot, only suppressive effect occurred, with pentacosane inhibiting shoot growth by 37.42% at 2.5 mg/mL (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). As of 
 <italic>P. annua</italic>, in general root development was inhibited, and the highest value was triggered by application of nonacosane at 5 mg/mL (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>); meanwhile, shoot length was promoted when alkane concentrations were lower than 2.5 mg/mL, and tricosane at 0.25 mg/mL enhanced shoot growth by 20.12% compared to the control. The mixture exhibited the most potent suppressive effect, resulting in 17.59% reduction on shoot elongation of 
 <italic>P. annua</italic> (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>).
