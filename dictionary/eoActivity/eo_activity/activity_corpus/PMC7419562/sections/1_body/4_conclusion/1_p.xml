<p id="Par23">The current study is the first report on the chemical profile and phytotoxicity of 
 <italic>O. acanthium</italic> essential oil, and on the phytotoxicity of Î²-eudesmol, which is speculated to be the responsible compound of flower oil, indicating their potential of being further explored as bioherbicides; flower oil and stem oil were found to be rich in 
 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes, implying that 
 <italic>O. acanthium</italic> has the potential to be further explored as a natural source to produce alkanes for industrial purpose.
