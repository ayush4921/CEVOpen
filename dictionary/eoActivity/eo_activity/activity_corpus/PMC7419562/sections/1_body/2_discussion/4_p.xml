<p id="Par14">This study indicated that flower oil possessed much stronger inhibitory effect compared with leaf and stem oils: the inhibition rate of flower oil on root growth of 
 <italic>A. retroflexus</italic> was 2.96 and 3.79 times of leaf and stem oils, and on 
 <italic>P. annua</italic> was 8.29 and 101.88 times of leaf and stem oils, respectively. Further experiment revealed that β-eudesmol (10.10%), which was a dominant compound in flower oil but not detected in leaf and stem oils, was most likely responsible for the potent phytotoxic activity of flower oil by comparing the strength of β-eudesmol and flower oil. β-eudesmol was found to possess antiangiogenic, antimutagenic, anticancer, antioxidant activity and so on, however there is no report on its phytotoxicity
