<p id="Par13">Besides, alkanes have been reported to be present in essential oils extracted from other Asteraceae plants. For instance, alkanes (C11-C27) accounted for 4.12% of the total mass of the essential oil of 
 <italic>Centaurea raphanina</italic>, and 6.1% of 
 <italic>C. spruneri</italic>

 <italic>Hemizonia fitchii</italic> oil contained 1.7% alkanes (C25–C29)

 <italic>Sigesbeckia jorullensis</italic> oil

 </sup>. Compared with published studies, alkanes (C22–C29) including tricosane, tetracosane, pentacosane, hexacosane, heptacosane, octacosane, nonacosane accounted for 57.33% in flower oil, and 82.33% in stem oil, indicating the potential value of utilizing 
 <italic>O. acanthium</italic> as a natural source to produce alkanes for industrial uses. It is noteworthy to mention that 
 <italic>O. acanthium</italic> is a widespread species with high biomass that can adapt to various environmental conditions including arid and barren habitats, which makes it practical to be cultivated in large scale for industrial purpose.
