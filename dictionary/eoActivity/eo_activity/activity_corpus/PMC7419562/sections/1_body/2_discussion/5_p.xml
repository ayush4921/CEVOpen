<p id="Par15">β-Eudesmol has been previously reported to be abundant in 
 <italic>Drimys winteri</italic> oil (7.27%), and in the drupe essential oil of 
 <italic>Citharexylum spinosum</italic> as the most abundant component (33.1%) and other species; in some cases, essential oils containing β-eudesmol were reported to exert phytotoxic activity, such as 
 <italic>Geranium wilfordii</italic> root oil (4.18% β-eudesmol), 
 <italic>Helichrysum italicum</italic> essential oil (1.4% β-eudesmol), 
 <italic>Achillea wilhelmsii</italic> essential oil (2.7% β-eudesmol), and 
 <italic>Rhynchosia minima</italic> (0.79% β-eudesmol and 16.38% α-eudesmol, an analog of β-eudesmol), however it is difficult to ascribe the activity to certain constituent (s), especially considering the fact that in most cases β-eudesmol was not even the major components in the oils with phytotoxic activity. It is noteworthy to mention that the current report is the first on the phytotoxicity of β-eudesmol
