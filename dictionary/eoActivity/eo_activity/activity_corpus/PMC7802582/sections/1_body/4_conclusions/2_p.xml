<p>We report for the first time anti‐
 <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> activity of 
 <italic>Dracocephalum kotschyi</italic>, in vitro, and in vivo. The results obtained in this study attribute to the essential oil of 
 <italic>D. kotschyi</italic>, inhibitory activity against 
 <italic>T. gondii</italic>, without toxicity to the host. It can be assumed that the mechanism of action of the essential oil against 
 <italic>T. gondii</italic> is associated with the mitochondrial function of 
 <italic>T. gondii</italic>. The essential oil of 
 <italic>D. kotschyi</italic> has an interesting pharmacological potential to be valued in the fight against toxoplasmosis. Supplementary works are necessary to identify actives compounds associated with anti‐
 <italic>Toxoplasma activity</italic>.
