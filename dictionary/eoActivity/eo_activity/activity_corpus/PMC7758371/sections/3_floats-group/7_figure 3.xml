  <p>Effects of common bean seeds coating with essential oils from mycorrhizal and non- mycorrhizal primed lemongrass at different concentrations and Ridomil on FRR and plant growth.

   <italic>F. solani</italic> (infested soil with 
   <italic>F. solani</italic> Fs4 and inhibitor-free seeds), Fs_(-) AMF
   <sub>500</sub> (infested soil with 
   <italic>F. solani</italic> Fs4 and seed coated with EOs from non-mycorrhizal lemongrass at the concentration of 500 ppm), Fs_(-) AMF
