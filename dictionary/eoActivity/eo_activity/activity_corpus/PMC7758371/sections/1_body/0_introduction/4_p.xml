<p id="p0020">However, estimates reveal that 95% of MAP currently used for diverse purposes are harvested in wild, without any remediation measure (

 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">McChesney et al., 2007</xref>). As such, there is actually strong advocacy in cooperating the cultivation of MAP into traditional agricultural system, to tackle the unsustainable harvest. Besides, it's well established that many component of the environment influence significantly plants growth and metabolic processes with subsequent repercussion on their inherent bioactivity (

 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Laku≈°ic et al., 2013</xref>). Nonetheless, reports pertaining to the stabilisation and or the optimisation of the performances of cultivated MAP are still fragmentary though the quality assurance across the whole production system would be necessary to sustainably assure the quality of the end products (
