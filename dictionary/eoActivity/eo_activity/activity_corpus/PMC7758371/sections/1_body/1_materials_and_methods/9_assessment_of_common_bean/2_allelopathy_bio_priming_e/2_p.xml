 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Toghueuo et al. (2016)</xref> was used to evaluate the effects of the tested EOs on common bean seeds germination or germination inhibition (Allelopathy). Bean seeds of the genotype GLP 190c, obtained from the germplasm of the National Institute of Agricultural Research for Development (IRAD) of Foumbot (West-Cameroon) were selected for any visible damage and surface-disinfected with Chlorox (5%, 1 min). The sterilizing solution was then removed by three rounds rinsing with sterile distilled water and blotted dried. The sterilized seeds were thereafter dipped in EOs suspensions for 2 h, and immediately transferred in 9.0cm Petri dishes provided with water-soaked tissue papers. The negative control seeds were soaked in sterile distilled water. Five plates with 10 seeds each were prepared per treatment and the whole experiment was conducted twice. The mean percentage of seeds germination was calculated in function of the total number of seeds per treatment following the

 <disp-formula id="fd4">
  <label>(4)</label>[(NGc-NGt)/ NGc]∗100.
 </disp-formula>Where: NGc and NGt are respectively the number of germinated seeds in the negative controls and treated plates.
