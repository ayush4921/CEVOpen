<p id="p0030">The experiment was conducted at the experimental farm of the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Yaoundé I, Cameroon between longitude 11°31′00″ E and latitude 3°52′00″ N. The site is located between 500 to 900 m height from the sea level within the 5
 <sup>th</sup> agro-ecological zone of Cameroon, characterized by a bimodal rainfall (1500 mm) pattern. The cropping was a raining season maize (
 <italic>Zea mays</italic> L.) and cassava (
 <italic>Minihot esculenta</italic>) rotation system. The on-site soil is a Sandy-clay-loam complex. The other physiochemical characteristics included; Organic matter (3.62%), C/N ratio (20.5), cation exchange capacity (29 meq/100 g) and pH of 5.2 (

Maize straw and weeds were removed and the field was plowed using the conventional manual hoe-ploughing tillage system to approximately 15–20 cm depth. Two plots with 0.5 m interval for non-inoculated control and AMF-inoculation were prepared with three replications each.
