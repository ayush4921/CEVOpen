 <italic>F. solani</italic> Fs4 conidial germination. In brief, sterile PDB (Himedia, India) medium (100 μL) were seeded in the wells of a 96-wells microtiter plate. Thereafter, stock solutions (100 μL) of either EOs or Ridomil Plus 44 WP were added in the first line wells so as to obtain the double of the desired inhibitor's concentration. Upon homogenization, a twofold serial dilution was undergone by transferring successively 100 μL of the content of the precedent wells into subsequent ones. Later on, 100 μL

 <sup>−1</sup> were pipetted in the wells. Wells with no inhibitors served as negative controls. The conidia germination was monitored after 10, 12, 14, 18, 20, 22 and 24 h of incubation by optical density (OD600 nm) readout (Magelan Infinite pro M200). The germination at each EO concentration was assessed as per the following

 <sub>t0</sub>: Optical density readout of a given well at time t = 0 (immediately after addition of pathogen's conidia in the mixture) whilst OD
 <sub>tx</sub> stands for optical density readout at time t = x (x &lt; 0).
