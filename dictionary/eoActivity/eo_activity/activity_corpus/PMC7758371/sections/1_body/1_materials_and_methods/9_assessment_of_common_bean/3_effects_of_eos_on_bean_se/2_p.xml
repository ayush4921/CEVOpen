<p id="p0085">To assure whether the EOs can promote bean seed germination while protecting them from 
 <italic>F. solani</italic> attack, sterilized seeds were soaked in EOs suspensions as described above. The reference fungicide (Ridomil Plus 44 WP), prepared in water at the dose recommended by the manufacturer (3.3 g.l
 <sup>−1</sup>) was used to coat the seeds. Both the EOs-treated and fungicide-treated seeds were allow to dry and afterward transferred into 9.0 cm Petri dishes (10 seeds/plate) provided with two layers of tissue paper. Then, 10 ml of 
 <italic>F. solani</italic> conidia suspension (4 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells.ml
 <sup>−1</sup>) prepared in PDB were seeded in each plate. The control plate was rather provided with equal volume of sterile PDB medium. 5 replications were prepared for each treatments and the overall experiment was performed twice. Germinated bean seeds were counted upon 10 days incubation and the percentage of germination was calculated with reference to the controls (
