 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Grover and Moore (1962)</xref>. Briefly, EOs and reference fungicide; Ridomil plus 44 WP were foremost dissolved in Tween 80 emulsifier (0.5% v/v) and added aseptically to sterile (121 °C, 15 min) Potato Dextrose Broth (PDB, Himedia, India) medium in 40 ml Eppendorf tubes so as to obtain final concentrations range of 62.5–1000 ppm selected from pre-tests where total inhibition of the pathogen's mycelial growth was obtained at the single dose of 1000 ppm. PDB with tween 80 was considered as negative controls. Thereafter, 50 μL of 
 <italic>Fusarium solani</italic> Fs4 conidial suspension (2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> conidia.ml
 <sup>−1</sup>) were inoculated in each tube. Four replications were prepared for each treatment and the overall experiment was repeated twice. The test and controls sets were incubated at 25 ± 2 °C for 10 days and the mycelial mats were harvested through filtration using pre-weighed filter paper and oven-dried (60 °C) till constant weight. The growth inhibition (GI) was thereafter calculated with reference to the negative control using the
