<p id="p0150">In this study, we recorded lemongrass biomass accumulation, improved essential oils yield upon mycorrhization under field conditions. Likewise, EO from mycorrhizal lemongrass consistently inhibited 
 <italic>F. solani</italic> Fs4 development, significantly more than the non-inoculated counterpart. At 1000 ppm, both the essential oils enhanced the common bean seeds germination, and protected plantlets from being infected by 
 <italic>F. solani</italic> Fs4 both in laboratory and greenhouse conditions, leading to more healthy and vigorous plants. Overall, AMF inoculation had reoriented the metabolome of lemongrass plant. Leading to an enhanced growth and antifungal potential of the resulting EO towards 
 <italic>F. solani</italic>. But the constance in the chemical composition should be demonstrated overtime in order to standardize the product and move ahead in the search of organic alternative to agrochemicals.
