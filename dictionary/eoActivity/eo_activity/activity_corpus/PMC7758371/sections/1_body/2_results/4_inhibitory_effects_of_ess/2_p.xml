<p id="p0110">The data reveal that the 
 <italic>F. solani</italic> conidia germination rate varied as function of concentration within and between EOs (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Irrespective of the essential oil involved, a negative correlation was found between the essential oils concentration and conidia germination in the sense that conidia germination speed dropped steadily as the EOs concentration increased. Between EOs, at lowest doses (62.5, 125 and 250 ppm), the overall inhibition of conidia germination of the EO from mycorrhizal lemongrass [(+)AMF] was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher compared to the un-inoculated counterpart (-)AMF]. At higher concentrations (500, 1000 and 2000 ppm) reversely, no growth was recorded upon subculture on solid medium with the EO from mycorrhizal lemongrass [(+)AMF] upon 8 h incubation till the end of the experiment. Whilst at 500 ppm, growth re-occurred with the EO from non-mycorrhizal lemongrass (-)AMF indicating a better performance of the EO from mycorrhizal lemongrass (MIC = 500 ppm; 8 h) over the non-mycorrhizal counterpart (MIC = 1000 ppm; 8 h).
