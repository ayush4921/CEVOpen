<p id="p0100">Data reporting the effects of mycorrhizal inoculation on the growth and the chlorophyll synthesis of lemongrass are presented (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">TableÂ 1</xref>). The 
 <italic>T-test</italic> revealed a significantly higher collar diameter (p = 0.02), branching (p = 0.015) and total chlorophyll synthesis in mycorrhizal lemongrass [(+)AMF] compared to the non-inoculated counterpart [(-)AMF]. Likewise, the Mycorrhizal efficiency (ME), indicating the increase in growth parameters of AMF-inoculated plants over the uninoculated ones showed a substantial accumulation in biomass production upon mycorrhization.
