<p id="p0115">Prior to pot trial, the EOs were screened out at their respective CMI and 2CMI on common bean seeds germination under sterile and 
 <italic>F. solani</italic> infected environments (
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). In the absence of the pathogen, as referred to the mock, both the EOs significantly slowed down the common bean seed germination at the concentration of 1000 ppm, indicating an allelopathic reaction at that concentration. Meanwhile, at 500 ppm the later rather enhanced the germination power by 7% and 19% respectively for EOs from non-inoculated and AMF-primed lemongrass. The ANOVA indicated a significantly higher germination rate at 500 ppm for (+)AMF EO compared to (-)AMF EO. In the presence of

 <italic>,</italic> while no germination was recorded in infected bean seeds, a protective effect was obvious upon coating the seeds with the EOs (p &lt; 0.05). Irrespective of the EO, the concentration 500 ppm was the best in both protecting and enhancing seed germination compared to 1000 ppm. The best germination rate being recorded with the EO from (+)AMF lemongrass (p &lt; 0.05).
