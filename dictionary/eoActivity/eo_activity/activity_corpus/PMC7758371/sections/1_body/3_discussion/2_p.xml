<p id="p0135">The efforts towards reducing the usage of pesticides in agricultural systems initiated in the second half of the 20th century has led to the investigation of alternative approaches of which botanical pesticides (

In spite of the broad spectrum activity of EOs against a plethora of agriculturally impactful pests and pathogens, just few manufactured pesticides is commercially availablereason being the instability in EOs composition which runs counter the legislation governing botanical pesticides validation. To address this task earlier findings focus on techniques likegenetic manipulations, the usage of elicitation products and new biotechnological methods to grow MAPs, aiming at both increasing the production and assuring standardized EOs composition (
