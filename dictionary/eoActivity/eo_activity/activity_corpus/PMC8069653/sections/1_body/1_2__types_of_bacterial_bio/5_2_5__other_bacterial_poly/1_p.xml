<p>Bacteria can even produce various types of biopolymers that can act as proteinaceous components and extracellular DNA. These types of biopolymers are not only responsible for pathogenesis in bacteria, but can be also used for biomaterial production. Extracellular DNA forms when a cell is lysed, releasing the intracellular DNA. In the case of biofilms, a cellular subpopulation lyses to produce extracellular DNA, like for example in stalks of mushroomlike microcolonies formed by

Because of the high negative charge, extracellular DNA has multiple roles in the adherence and stability of the matrix of biofilm by interaction with cationic polysaccharides (like Pel) and other cations and can also act as a source of nutrients at times of starvation conferring resistivity to antibiotics.
