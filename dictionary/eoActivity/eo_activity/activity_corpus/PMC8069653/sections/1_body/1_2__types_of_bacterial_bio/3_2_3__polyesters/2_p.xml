<p>PHAs are known to be a distinctive bioplastic that can be chemically modified or bioengineered to be used as high-value medical biomaterials such as scaffolds in tissue engineering, sutures, particulate vaccines, and drug carriers or to be used as low-value bioplastic [
 <xref rid="B34-polymers-13-01242" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Synthesis of tailor-made PHAs through physical blending, bioengineering, or chemical modification produced enhanced materialistic properties that met the requirements of medical and industrial usage. Microbial cell factories can be biologically engineered to produce PHA inclusions that can be heavily coated with proteins of functional interest. These functionalized beads of PHA were stable even after being separated from the cell mass of bacteria, indicating high-value performance as immunodiagnostics, vaccines, enzyme carriers, bio separation resins, and tools required in the production of recombinant proteins. Additionally, the functional performance of these protein-coated, non-porous beads of PHA can be tuned further by regulated encapsulation inside porous microspheres of alginate allowing flow-through usage [
