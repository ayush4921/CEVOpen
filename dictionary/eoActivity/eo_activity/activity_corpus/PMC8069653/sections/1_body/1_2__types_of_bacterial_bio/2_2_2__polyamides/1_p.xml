<p>Bacteria are capable of producing polyaminoacids or polyamides like secreted poly-L-lysine and poly-D-glutamic acid or the intracellularly produced cyanophycin (copolymer of L-arginine and L-asapartic acid), and they can serve as biofilm matrix components or capsular polymer and also storage materials [
 <xref rid="B35-polymers-13-01242" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Just like the polysaccharides of biofilm matrix, polyamide biofilm or capsule is less immunogenic, thereby protecting pathogens like 
 <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic> from being attacked by the host immune system [

 <italic>Bacillus megaterium</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacillus licheniformis</italic>, and many of the cyanobacteria [

Metabolic engineering helps in the production of biotechnologically enhanced polyamides. Polyamides potentially substitute chemically produced polymers in industries. For example, poly-D-glutamic acid can be utilized as a flocculant for replacing synthetic flocculants (polyacrylamide or polyaluminium chloride) for treating wastewater [
