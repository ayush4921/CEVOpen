<p>Some enzymes naturally alter the materialistic properties of polysaccharides to modify their biological functions. For example, the existence of acetyl groups on chains of polysaccharides remarkably modify structural conformities, thereby affecting chainâ€“chain interactions, water-retention capacity, solubility, molecular weight, and viscoelasticity [

Using genetically engineered polysaccharide-modifying enzymes in microbial cell factories or using these enzymes to modify polysaccharides in vitro allows the generation of tailor-made polysaccharides. The fabrication of these materials after modification changes on being blended with other non-polymeric or polymeric components (esterification of stearic acid, crosslinking of citric acid, and plasticizers). Blending accounts for modification of properties like degree of gelation, viscoelasticity, material strength, and porosity. These materials are being used as feedstock components and as bioinks in 3D bioprinting with varied engineering and biomedical applications like drug testing and drug delivery and tissue engineering. 3D cell-loaded scaffolds made from hyaluronate or alginate can be extensively used as artificial extracellular matrix (ECM), providing for a temporary environment for supporting adhesion, invasion, proliferation, and differentiation of different types of cells such as fibroblasts, mesenchymal stem cells, embryonic stem cells, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts [
