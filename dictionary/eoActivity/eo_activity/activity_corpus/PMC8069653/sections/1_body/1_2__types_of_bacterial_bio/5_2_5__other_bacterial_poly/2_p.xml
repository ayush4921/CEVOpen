<p>Secreted polypeptides are composed of alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues of amino acids and proteins like pilin, fibrillin, and flagellin. These polypeptides can serve as molecular elementary units to form extracellular self-built structures like pili, fimbiriae, flagella, and functional amyloids such as curli fibers. These self-assembled structures are capable of forming nanotubes or nanofibers, mediating cell adhesion on abiotic and biotic surfaces, developing matrix of biofilm, or providing motility during pathogenesis. Various features like increased ratio of surface area to volume, the explicit arrangement of building blocks of proteins, and polymorphic transformations of these structures are a result of their responses against chemical and physical stimulations, making them a potential component in industrial and biomedical applications. These properties make them important biomaterials and bio templates for the designing of novel nanodevices, nanostructures, and multiple layered lattices to be used in nanomedicines (drug delivery) and bioengineering [

The genetic programmability and the simplicity of engineering polypeptides, proteins, and extracellular DNA make them attractive for manufacturing programmable biomaterial-based platforms, which can be hardly manufactured with other types of biopolymers like polyesters and polysaccharides. Moreover, the uncomplicated genetic programmability helped in the development of bioengineered living materials in which the live cells are bioengineered for autonomous self-assembly of all the materials, having tunable and novel properties for different purposes like microbial electrosynthesis, electronic devices for monitoring, biosensors, and bioremediation [
