<p>Apart from acting as virulence factors, bacterial polysaccharides exhibit distinctive materialistic properties. Synthesis of polysaccharides chemically is tedious, expensive, and restricted to low molecular weight molecules and could be done only for a few types of polysaccharides. Thus, microbial cell factories are essential for manufacturing these polymers. As hydrophilic groups (carboxyl and hydroxyl groups) are present on the polysaccharides, these polysaccharides actually have high water-retention capacity allowing crosslinking (polymer–polymer, drug–polymer, host tissue–polymer, and cellular interactions) and intermolecular interactions. Polysaccharides are able to form porous hydrogels to be used in drug delivery and controlled delivery of anti-cancer drugs [

Hydrogels that are made from bacterial cellulose can serve as efficient matrices, fiber composites, or hydrogel nanofibrillar scaffold network, having biomedical applications such as wound dressing that can deliver human dermal fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes [

 <italic>Streptococcus zooepidemicus</italic> also has wide biomedical applications [
