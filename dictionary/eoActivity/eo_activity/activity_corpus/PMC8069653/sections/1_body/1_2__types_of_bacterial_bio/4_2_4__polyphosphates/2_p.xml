<p>Since polyPs can eminently act as an energy-storing material, they have been widely used in industries to provide energy in carrying out enzyme-catalyzed reactions. They are used as biologically active biomaterials in the production of regenerative medicines for repairing cartilages and in the regeneration of bones or can be also used as vehicles for drug-delivery. As polyPs can react with cationic polymers (like hyaluronate and alginate), inorganic cations (like Mg
 <sup>2+</sup>, Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>, Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>, Na
 <sup>+</sup>, Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>, and K
 <sup>+</sup>) or other organic alkaline components (like peptides, polyamines, and amino acids), they can be converted into hydrogels or nanoparticles to be used in biomineralization of bones [

Essentially, physical properties like functionality and stability and mechanical durability of polyP-associated complex nanoparticles or hydrogels may change depending upon the class of blended polymeric substances or interacting counterions. This modification furnishes considerable space designing for the generation of a wide variety of materialistic properties for bioinks and smart biomaterials in regenerative medicines. Living organisms, particularly bacteria, are considered as the only source of polyp, since there are no known abiotic polyP minerals found on Earth. Bacteria of the genera

 <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> can produce granules of polyP with increased yield and therefore can be used as potential producers for polyP manufacture [
