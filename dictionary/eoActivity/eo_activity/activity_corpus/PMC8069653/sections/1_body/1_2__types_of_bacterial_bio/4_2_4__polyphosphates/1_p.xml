<p>Polyphosphate (polyP) is a polymer consisting of condensed phosphates (several inorganic phosphates), which have a high negative charge along with high-energy anhydride bonds. PolyP serves as an energy storing polymer. PolyP biosynthesis results from an evolutionary activity of bacteria, and this helps in providing chemical energy for the various biosynthetic pathways inside bacterial cells and can act as buffers against bases. Additionally, polyPs can act as a metal chelating agent contributing to the formation of channel complexes in order to uptake DNA. PolyPs aid in cell signalling regulation, thus affecting the lifestyle of bacteria, their growth, persistence, viability, virulence, and stress tolerance [
