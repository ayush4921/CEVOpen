<p>Glycogen is secreted from the capsular polysaccharides that are associated with the surface of the cell and result in the development of the matrix of the biofilm [

 <italic>E. coli</italic> produces phosphoethanolamine cellulose, which forms mortar-like structures to stabilize proteinaceous curli fibers. These fibers mediate strong connections between cells in complex biofilms and provide resistance in high-shear conditions. Hyaluronate produced by

 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> helps in mimicking hyaluronate being present within the connective tissues, thus protecting them from phagocytosis [

 <italic>Neisseria meningitides</italic> resembles the polysialic moieties of human antigen, thereby making it invisible within the host exerting its pathogenicity [
