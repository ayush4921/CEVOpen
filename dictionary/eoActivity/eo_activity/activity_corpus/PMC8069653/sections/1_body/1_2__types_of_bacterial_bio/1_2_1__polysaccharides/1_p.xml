<p>Polysaccharides are mainly divided into two categories, namely heteropolymers and homopolymers. These polysaccharides can be uncharged or charged, repeating or non-repeating, and un-branched or branched. A plethora of bacteria can produce polysaccharides and reserve them within their cells, such as glycogen, or they may also secrete polysaccharides, which are attached to the cell surfaces or free exopolysaccharides that help in the matrix formation in biofilms (cellulose and alginate mainly) [
 <xref rid="B7-polymers-13-01242" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. On being motile, pathogenic organisms produce various virulence factors and other toxic substances such as exotoxins. On the other hand, while in sessile state, pathogens produce different exopolysaccharides such as cellulose, alginate, and hyaluronate, acting as components of biofilm matrix. This shifting to sessile biofilm state defines the onset of chronic infectious diseases, since the encapsulated or embedded cells are shielded from host immune responses and anti-microbial drugs [
 <xref rid="B11-polymers-13-01242" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For example, alginate present inside the matrix of biofilm in 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> contributes to enhancing the surviving chances of the bacterial cells by shielding them from phagocytosis [
 <xref rid="B1-polymers-13-01242" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Alginates react with divalent cations forming dense hydrogels with increased water-retention capacity [
 <xref rid="B20-polymers-13-01242" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Again, cellulose production accounts for identical advantages to enterococcal pathogens [
 <xref rid="B21-polymers-13-01242" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> is known to produce phosphoethanolamine cellulose that can form a mortar-like structure for stabilization of proteinaceous curli fibers. These fibers strongly interconnect the biofilm forming cells, providing resistivity against conditions of high stress [
 <xref rid="B22-polymers-13-01242" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Other pathogens like 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> G9241 and 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> consist of a capsule made of hyaluronate, which is a linear heteropolysaccharide with negative charge and a structural homolog of hyaluronate that is found in the connective tissues of humans. Thus, these pathogens can easily escape from being exposed to phagocytosis and opsonization. Serogroup B 
 <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> leads to invasive diseases of meningitis because of the presence of the capsular polysaccharide consisting of sialic acid homopolymers (N-acetylneuraminic acid) having α-2, 8 sialic acid bonds. This polymeric structure of the moieties of polysialic acid resembles the structure of the antigens present in human tissues, and this molecular analogy accounts for reduced immunogenic properties of the capsular polysaccharides, thereby rendering the pathogen non-immunogenic to the host [

 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> is one of the leading pathogens in causing severe lung diseases and consists of over 100 serotypes producing diverse capsular polysaccharides for evasion of adaptive host immune response [
 <xref rid="B24-polymers-13-01242" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Capsular and secreted polysaccharides are widely used as antigens for producing conjugate vaccines. Designing of serotype-independent vaccines is increasing because of the varying serotypes of 
 <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> and 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, which decreases the effectiveness of these vaccines [
 <xref rid="B1-polymers-13-01242" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Glycogen is a water-soluble polymer consisting of α-1, 6 and α-1, 4 glycosidic linkages, and it is the most well-known form of carbon and energy reserve for survival during starvation. In case of intracellular infections, glycogen helps the pathogens like 
 <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> and 
 <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> to survive [
