<p>Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) are bacterially produced bioplastics. They have a linear symmetry and are arranged in hydrophobic spheric inclusion, functioning as a carbon and energy reserving material [
 <xref rid="B10-polymers-13-01242" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Even though many gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria can secrete PHAs, the functions of PHAs and the potential genes involved in PHA-mediated pathogenesis and persistence are still unknown. PHA
 <sup>âˆ’</sup> mutants of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> reveal decreased attachment to surfaces of glass and diminished stress tolerance in presence of biofilms, therefore revealing a significant contribution of PHA in persistence in infections [

 <italic>Xanthomonas oryzae</italic> (causes major rice production losses), the regulatory protein called PhaR represses the synthesis of PHA and also suppresses EPS production, thus affecting virulence and phenotypic changes modifying lifestyle of the bacteria [
 <xref rid="B38-polymers-13-01242" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. PHAs are reported to be electron sinks, which in anaerobic conditions (terminal electron or oxygen absence) enhance survival [
 <xref rid="B38-polymers-13-01242" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Synthesis and mobilization of PHA are controlled under responses such as environmental stimuli and environmental and nutritional stresses, rendering an advantageous survival.
