Due to its non-antigenicity, biodegradability, biocompatibility, and chelating capacities, alginate is extensively used in various biomedical fields such as drug delivery, tissue engineering, and also in a few formulations to prevent acid reflux. This polymer has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), making alginate an important biomaterial to have been applied in the production of regenerative medicines and nutritional supplements [
