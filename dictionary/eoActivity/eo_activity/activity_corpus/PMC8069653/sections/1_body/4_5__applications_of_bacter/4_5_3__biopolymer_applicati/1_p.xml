<p>Substitution of the oil-based packaging materials with biological containers and films provide an added advantage due to their greener and sustainable image, since they have improved technical features. Biopolymers have been recently used as food coatings, matrices of encapsulation for functional foods, and as packaging materials for foods. These biopolymers give unique remedies for improving the shelf life of the products, thereby reducing the total carbon footprint associated with packaging of foods [
 <xref rid="B127-polymers-13-01242" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. In food industries, the biomaterials finds application in three primary sectors: food coating, food packaging, and edible films for encapsulating functional foods. The most commonly used biomaterials in food packaging are some biodegradable bioplastics and polyesters such as PHA and PLA, which can be modified using traditional equipment. These bio-based polymers are also used in numerous multilayer and monolayer applications in the field of food packaging. PLA biopolymer is one of the most potentially used biodegradable biopolymers. This is because it has balanced features and is commercially easily available. Particularly PLA is used in food packaging, because it has an exceptionally good transparency along with high water resistivity. The main challenge posed by these biopolymers is their unimproved thermal and barrier properties and so they cannot act like polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The innate processing difficulty and excessive rigidity have limited the use of biopolymers in traditional devices. The hydrophilic characteristics of most of the bio-based materials also limit their uses as high-value products. On absorbing moisture, these biopolymers become plasticized, thereby reducing the barrier qualities of these biopolymers.
