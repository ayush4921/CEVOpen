<p>A biopolymer produced by the thermophilic bacteria 
 <italic>Bacillus licheniformis</italic> and a lipopeptide-based biosurfactant obtained from marine 
 <italic>B. megaterium</italic> were compared to test their efficacies in enhanced recovery of oil [
 <xref rid="B61-polymers-13-01242" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The unrefined biosurfactant produced by acid precipitation reduced interfacial tension between water and lube oil from 18.6 to 1.5 mN/m and decreased the surface tension of water (deionized) from 70.5 to 28.25 mN/m at a concentration of 250 mg/ l. The biosurfactant showed highest emulsification activity (E
 <sub>24</sub>) of 81.66% against lube oil. Adding calcium ions to the solution of biosurfactant stabilized the lipopeptide micelles. The efficiency of oil recovery in the case of calcium ion conditioned solution of lipopeptide in a sand-packed column was being optimized with the help of ANN modelling in combination with genetic algorithm (GA) approach. Three major factors, namely concentration of lipopeptide, pH of the solution, and concentration of calcium ions, were taken into consideration for carrying out the optimization studies.
