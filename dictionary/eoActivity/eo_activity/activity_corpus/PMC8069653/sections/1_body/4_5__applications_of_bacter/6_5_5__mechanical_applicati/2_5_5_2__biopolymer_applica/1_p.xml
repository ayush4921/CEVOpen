<p>Soil treatment followed by improvement is generally performed in geotechnical engineering sections. Various materials and methods have so far been used for soil stabilization and as cement binders in soil engineering. However, the demand for eco-friendly and sustainable approaches is currently on the rise. This is because cement production causes a huge amount of carbon dioxide to be emitted, so there are required substituents like chemical polymers, geochemical, geosynthetics, bacterial biopolymers, and microbial induction. Chang et al., 2016, demonstrated that bacterial biopolymers have a high capacity in replacing cement as a material for soil treatment with respect to their eco-friendly development and production [

Therefore, bacterial biopolymers can be potentially used as a binder to strengthen soils. Biopolymers vary widely in molecular structures because of their polymerization processes, thereby enabling biopolymer production with customized plasticity or strength, innate biodegradability, and limited emission of carbon dioxide during their production [
