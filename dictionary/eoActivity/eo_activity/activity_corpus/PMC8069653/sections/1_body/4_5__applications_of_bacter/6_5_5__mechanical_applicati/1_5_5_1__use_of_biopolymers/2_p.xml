<p>The main polymers that are involved in this mechanism are mainly xanthan and dextran. Insoluble dextran generated from 
 <italic>L. mesenteroides</italic> has been observed to remarkably decrease permeability of soils by greater than one order of magnitude with just a little quantity of dextran, i.e., lower than 10% saturation of the pores. They also reported that an increased content of clay in sands may result in enhanced resistance against erosion and increased heterogeneous erosion characteristics. Thus, from their study, it was concluded that both biopolymer as well as clay content increase significantly the cohesive forces of soils and reduce their void ratio and permeability.
