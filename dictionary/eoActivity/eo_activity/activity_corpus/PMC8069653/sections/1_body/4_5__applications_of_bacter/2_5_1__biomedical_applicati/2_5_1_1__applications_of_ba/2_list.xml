  <p>Devices for targeted drug delivery: Within solid tablets, cellulose ether leads to a swelling-controlled drug release, since the tablet itself comes in contact with the physiological fluids. This cellulose ether over the surfaces of the tablets starts swelling, thereby forming a chain-like entrapment or a physical hydrogel. As the swelling starts expanding and penetrating from the surfaces to the glass-like core of the tablets, the drug readily gets dissolved in water, diffusing out through the network of polymers [
