<p>With the aim of further improving the recovery efficacy, a soluble biopolymer from 
 <italic>B. licheniformis</italic> served as flooding agent after incubation of the biosurfactant. After ANN–-GA optimization, oil recovery of 45% was attained when the biopolymer as flooding agent was present at a concentration of 3 g/L. On using only water as a flooding agent, there was 29% oil recovery at optimum conditions as predicted by the ANN–-GA optimization strategy. They also tested the various essential features like viscosity, bio-cementing capacity, and pore plugging capacity of the biopolymer. Thus, biosurfactant incubation in combination with biopolymer flooding, under optimum process conditions, showed an oil recovery of 45%. Therefore, it can be concluded from this study that the combined interplay between biopolymer and biosurfactant aided in mobilization and solubilization of oil from the soil.
