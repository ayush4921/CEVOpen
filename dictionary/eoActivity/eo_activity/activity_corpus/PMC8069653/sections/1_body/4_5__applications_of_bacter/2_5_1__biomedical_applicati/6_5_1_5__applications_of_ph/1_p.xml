<p>PHB is an environmentally friendly substituent of synthetic or artificial thermoplastics, since it has similar properties to those of the synthetic polymer polypropylene and is entirely biodegradable on being subjected to natural conditions after being disposed of. Thus, substituting nonbiodegradable polymers with eco-friendly and completely biodegradable biopolymers such as PHB will serve the purpose of combating ecological problems resulting from production, usage, and disposal of artificial polymers [

 <list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <p>Scaffolds in tissue engineering: PHB has well known applications in the manufacture of scaffolds used in tissue engineering, because they have ideal materialistic properties like biocompatibility, can very well support growth of the cells, and also help in guiding and organizing cells.</p>

   <p>Growth of cells: PHB acts as a unique biomaterial for supporting the growth of different types of cells such as osteoblasts, fibroblasts, umbilical endothelial vein cells in humans, smooth muscle cells in aorta of rabbits, and chondrocytes derived from cartilage, because PHB can get readily metabolized in the cellular biosynthetic pathway [

   <p>Reconstructive surgeries: In vivo and gradual biodegradability of PHB makes it an excellent and potential biopolymer to be used in reconstructive surgeries and to develop cardiovascular products like vascular grafts, pericardial patches, and heart valves [

   <p>Controlled system for drug delivery and aids in surgeries: In a controlled drug delivery system, a carrier component that is potentially nonharmful to an organism and has essential mechanical, physical, and biomedical features like biodegradability in biological medium is required. As PHB along with its derivatives match these criteria, so they can be used in controlled drug delivery processes, manufacturing of sutures, surgical pins, swabs, wound healing, bone plates and replacements, orthopaedic applications, and remodeling of cartilage [

   <p>Peripheral implants and substitutes: PHB is utilized as a pericardial replacement and blood vessel substituent, and it also serves the purpose of stimulating growth and healing of bones and acts as dental and cardiovascular implants because of its piezoelectric characteristics [
    <xref rid="B122-polymers-13-01242" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. Sodian et al., 2000, also found that PHB can be successfully used in the fabrication of porous, biodegradable, three-dimensional heart valve scaffolds [

   <p>Various disease treatments: The main product of biodegradation of PHB is 4-hydroxyl butyrate (HB), which is active pharmacologically and is a very promising compound for treating different diseases including narcolepsy, alcohol addiction withdrawal syndrome, cationic and chronic schizophrenia, chronic brain syndrome, atypical psychoses, drug addiction withdrawal, circulatory collapse, Parkinson’s disease, cancer, radiation exposure, and various other neuropharmacological diseases [
    <xref rid="B123-polymers-13-01242" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. Units of HB are used to effectively treat narcolepsy, which is a sleeping disorder in humans that is detected during early adulthood causing paralysis, unanticipated sleep attacks, and in few cases, temporary muscle tone loss. HB can even act as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS) of mammals, because it has a close chemical and structural homology with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA—a regulator of muscle tone), which functions on the receptors for GABA, thereby reducing narcolepsy and regulating the muscle tone [
