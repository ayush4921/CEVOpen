<p>In another study conducted by Jeong et al., 2019, they examined the MEOR process efficiency on the basis of in-situ selective plugging through production of bacterial biopolymers and then optimization with nutrient injection approach for obtaining highest oil recovery [
 <xref rid="B138-polymers-13-01242" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. This experiment was done based on the in situ selective plugging by the production of the bacterial biopolymer called dextran from 
 <italic>L. mesenteroides</italic>. Dextran production and bacterial growth were explained using a stoichiometric equation and kinetic reactions by using batch model simulation. On the basis of the parameters for permeability lowering generated by the sandpack model, the process of MEOR was materialized in a pilot-scale plant, which included an extremely permeable thief zone within a reservoir with low permeability. The basic MEOR process achieved 61.5% enhancement of the recovery factor as compared to that achieved with only waterflooding. The simulations of the parameters indicated that the efficiency of recovery was affected by the quantity and distribution of dextran, proving that the injection approach is critical in controlling distribution of dextran. On incorporation of the results obtained from the sensitivity optimization and analysis, it was concluded that there was an improvement of 36.7% in the efficiency of oil recovery using the optimized process of MEOR as compared to that of the basic process.
