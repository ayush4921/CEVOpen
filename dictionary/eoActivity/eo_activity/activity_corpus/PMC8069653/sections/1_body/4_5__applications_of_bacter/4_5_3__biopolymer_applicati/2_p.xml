<p>Biopolymers are also used in encapsulation processes. Encapsulation is defined as the process by which sensitive substances are protected from effects of adverse environmental conditions. The term microencapsulation is a well-organized process to wrap solids or liquids or gases inside small capsules, which are capable of releasing their constituents under particular circumstances [

Biopolymers are immensely used as edible coatings and films because of their capability to incorporate diverse types of functional components. Plasticizers like polyethylene glycol (PEG), acetylated monoglycerides, and glycerol are used to alter the mechanical features of the coating or film, thereby making significant modifications in barrier characteristics of the films. The main advantage of coatings includes their utilization as an incorporation vehicle for active and natural ingredients like antimicrobial agents and antioxidants, functional components consisting of vitamins, minerals, and probiotics or enzymes. These bio-based ingredients can be consumed along with the food materials, thereby enhancing their sensory and nutritional qualities and ensuring safety of these products for human consumption. Edible films can be used as aroma or flavor carriers besides limiting the loss of aroma [
