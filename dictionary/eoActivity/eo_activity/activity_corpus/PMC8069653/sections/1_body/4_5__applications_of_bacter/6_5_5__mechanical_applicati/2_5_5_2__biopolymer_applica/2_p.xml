<p>Xanthan gum and gellan gum are the mainly used bacterial polymers for preparing binders. Since xanthan can act as a rheology modifier, it can be used to strengthen soil, notably when clayey particles (hydrogen bonds between clay particles and xanthan gum) are present [
 <xref rid="B136-polymers-13-01242" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. Gellan gum can form immensely thickened gel at very low concentrations of 0.05â€“0.25%. Because of its enhanced stability even at low pH and high temperature, gellan can serve as an excessively durable additive for improvement and stabilization of soil [

More studies are still going on to ensure the performances of these bacterial biopolymers in terms of reliability, practical implementation, and durability for applications of in-situ biopolymers in the field of geotechnical engineering.
