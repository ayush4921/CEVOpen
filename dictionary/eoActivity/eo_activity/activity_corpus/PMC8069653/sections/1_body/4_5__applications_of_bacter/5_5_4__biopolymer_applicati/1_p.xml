<p>Today, the most industrially used food packaging materials are specific biodegradable polyesters, since they can be modified using traditional equipment. Among all the bioplastics, the most widely used biopolymer is PHA and PLA [

For using biopolymers as packaging materials to package food products, the most significant factor to be considered is their barrier properties. Biopolymers, which are hydrophilic, generally have a low moisture resistivity causing transmission of water vapour via packaging affecting food quality. This in turn leads to diminished shelf life, increased prices, and causing more generation of waste products. Another way of improving the barrier properties of biopolymers is addition of different nanofillers such as nano clays and metal oxide nanoparticles [
