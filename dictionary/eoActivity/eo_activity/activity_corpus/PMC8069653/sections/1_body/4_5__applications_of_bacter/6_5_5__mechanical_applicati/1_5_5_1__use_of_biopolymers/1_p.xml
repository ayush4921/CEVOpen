<p>The soft biopolymers produced by the bacteria help in altering the resistance against soil erosion. Ham et al., 2018, used the model bacteria 
 <italic>L. mesenteroides</italic> to produce biopolymers that can increase resistance against soil surface and erosion and critical shear stress [
 <xref rid="B134-polymers-13-01242" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. They found that the reason behind improving the soil surface erosion resistance is the enhanced cohesive effects of grain-coating slimes of biopolymer, thereby decreasing seepage flows because of the clogged pores as a result of biopolymer formation.
