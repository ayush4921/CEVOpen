<p>Metal nanoparticles, because of their effects from quantum size, exhibit a wide variety of unique properties [

The conventional synthetic methods involve highly toxic reducing agents such as inorganic solvents, N-dimethylformamide, hydrazine, and sodium borohydride. All these chemical compounds have a high reactivity posing a serious ecological and biological risk. Due to the increased focus on elimination/ minimization of hazardous wastes, appropriate sustainable processes have been developed using green chemistry strategies. Biopolymers such as BC, poly lactic acid (PLA), and PHA are widely used as reducing and capping agents to synthesize various nanoparticles as the substituent of different toxic reagents [
