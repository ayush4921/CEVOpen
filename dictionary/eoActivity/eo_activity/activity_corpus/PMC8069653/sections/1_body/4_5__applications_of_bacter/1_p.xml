<p>Bacterial biopolymers not only lead to pathogenesis, but also provide a plethora of industrial as well as biomedical applications. Due to their biocompatibility and biodegradability, they can be used to enhance the performances and functions of other bioactive molecules in a particular product. These biopolymers can be also modified and altered in various ways to meet biomedical and industrial demands (
