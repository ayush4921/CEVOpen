 <italic>P. mendocina</italic>, 
 <italic>A. chroococcum</italic>, and 
 <italic>A. beijerinckii</italic> can simultaneously produce PHAs and other biosurfactants by utilization of the same organic substrate. Nevertheless, the technological performance of the bacteria during coupled biosurfactant and PHA production leads to a decreased PHA production. Particularly, the optimum operating conditions for biosurfactant and PHA production are actually different [
