<p>Bacterial cellulose (BC) is a homopolysaccharide comprising only D-glucose polymers linked via Î²-1,4 glycosidic bonds formed from precursor UDP-D-glucose via membrane embedded enzyme glycosyl transferase (cellulose synthase BcsA). BC exhibits unique mechanical and functional features, and therefore it is widely used in biomedical applications such as synthesis of biocomposites. 
 <italic>Komagataeibacter xylinus</italic> is widely known for cellulose production. Studies have shown that ethanol has a positive effect on the yield of cellulose by 
 <italic>Komagataeibacter xylinus</italic>, as ethanol provides an alternate source of energy to synthesize cellulose through glucose metabolism. Ethanol helps in the induction of genes that are associated with UDP-glucose formation and represses the genes that are associated with the mechanism of glycolysis [

 <xref rid="B77-polymers-13-01242" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. BC production is highly expensive, since it is produced either by chemical processes or enzymatically. BC cannot be produced from bacteria that can grow on low cost substrates such as CW or CW permeate. 
 <italic>K. sucrofermentans</italic> strain DSM 15973 produced BC with a very low productivity of 0.0047 g/L/h [
