<p>Hyaluronic acid (HA) is an anionic linear polymer of repeating units of disaccharides consisting of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and D-glucuronic acid produced by bacteria such as 
 <italic>Pasteurella multocida</italic> and 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> sp. HA is found in tissues of higher organisms and it is a polymer of biomedical importance. The precursors involved in HA synthesis are UDP-N-acetyl-glucosamine and UDP-D glucuronate, and the reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme hyaluronan synthase (Has A) [

 <italic>Streptococcus zooepidemicus</italic> strain ATCC 25346 after cultivation in medium containing CW or concentrated whey protein produced a moderate HA concentration of 2.14 g/L (0.20 g/L/h) [
