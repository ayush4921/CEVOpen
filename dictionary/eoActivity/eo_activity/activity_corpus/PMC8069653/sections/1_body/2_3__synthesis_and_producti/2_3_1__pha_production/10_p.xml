<p>An artificial neural network (ANN) model in combination with the algorithm of particle swarm optimization (PSO) was utilized in order to optimize process variables during enhanced production of lipopeptides by aquatic

In the case of non-linear ANN model, pH, temperature, aeration, and agitation were considered as input variables, and concentration of the lipopeptide as the output variable. On applying PSO to the ANN model, optimum values for the process parameters were taken as: temperature = 33.3 °C, pH = 6.7, aeration rate = 128 l/h, and agitation rate = 458 rpm. Under optimal conditions, lipopeptide production was significantly enhanced from the wastes by almost 46% (
 <italic>w/v</italic>), thereby reducing the operational cost by 20 times in comparison to the traditional synthetic medium. Therefore, the novelty of this approach lies in the fact that the combined ANN–PSO optimization model can enhance the yield of fermentative products such as lipopeptide-based biosurfactants from wastes (
