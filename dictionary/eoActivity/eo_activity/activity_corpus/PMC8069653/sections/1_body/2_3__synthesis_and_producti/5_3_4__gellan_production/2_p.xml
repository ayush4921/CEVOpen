<p>Another method for gellan production is by using a newer strain called 
 <italic>S. azotofigens</italic> strain GL-1 [
 <xref rid="B72-polymers-13-01242" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,
 <xref rid="B73-polymers-13-01242" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. This bacterial strain was cultivated inside shake flasks at 30 Â°C and pH 6.5 by utilization of CW medium or molasses. The CW-based medium produced a maximum gellan concentration of 33.75 g/L (0.70 g/L/h). This so obtained gellan possessed a lower glucuronate and higher rhamnose and glycerate content altogether as compared with gellan produced from molasses containing medium.
