To make the biopolymers cost-effective, they are being widely produced using various industrial by-products, thereby solving the problem of industrial waste disposal after they are generated. Solid state fermentation (SSF) is a cutting edge biotechnological approach for high fermentation productivity and high concentration of product. For example,

 <xref rid="B57-polymers-13-01242" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Levan can be produced by this bacterial strain through SSF by use of a rapeseed meal as the sole substrate. Levan purification was done by low-pressure liquid chromatography utilizing various types of column fillers. These production strategies can be effectively used to design cell factories for biopolymer production to be used in cosmetics, foods, agriculture, healthcare and medical industries, oil recovery, mining, packaging, textile and printing industries, pharmaceuticals, packaging, and wastewater treatment [
