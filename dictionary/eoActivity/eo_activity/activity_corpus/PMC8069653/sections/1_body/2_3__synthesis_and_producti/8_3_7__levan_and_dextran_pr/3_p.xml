<p>Column experiments using fine sand and 
 <italic>L. mesenteroides</italic> to produce insoluble biopolymers were monitored for permeability changes through P and S wave responses. It was found that the bacterial biopolymer reduced the permeability by greater than one order of magnitude, involving approximately 10% of porous volume after growing for 38 days [
 <xref rid="B85-polymers-13-01242" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. This reduction was due to internal complex structures of the biopolymers, which get accumulated in the throats of the pores. S wave velocity (V
 <sub>S</sub>) was reported to be greater than 50% when the biopolymer was accumulated, causing a significant stiffening effect on the shear modulus of unconsolidated matrix sediment during confining and low stress conditions. On replacing pore water with insoluble bacterial biopolymer, it was observed that there were minimal modifications in P wave velocity (V
 <sub>P</sub>) because of the low elastic modulus of the insoluble biopolymer. Upon analyzing the spectral ratio, it was observed that the P wave attenuation increased by 50–80% in both sub-ultrasonic and ultrasonic ranges of frequency, while S wave attenuation increased by almost 50–60%.
