<p>Out of all the known EPSs, alginate is essentially important for applications in food industries. It is used in restructured foods, frozen custards, cake mixtures, and cream and beer manufacture. Alginate consists of varying amounts of C-5 epimer α-L-glucuronic acid and β-D-mannuronic acid joined through β-1,4 glycosidic bonds. During alginate extraction from the harvested product, these uronic acids get converted to salts of glucuronate and mannuronate via a neutralization step. The distribution, length, and proportion of these blocks influence the physical and chemical properties of alginate. Commercial alginates are extracted from bacteria such as
