<p>Most of the design of the cell factories depends on target gene manipulation in the biosynthetic pathways. It is reported that a novel synthetic approach called FENIX has been designed to post-translationally regulate levels of protein [
 <xref rid="B60-polymers-13-01242" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. FENIX allows independent regulation of the steady-state protein level and induction of target protein accumulation. The FENIX device is made of a constitutive and proteasome-associated degradation of the desired polypeptide by tagging a hybrid, short, and synthetic NIa/ SsrA sequence of amino acid on the C-terminal domain. Production of proteins is induced through an orthogonal inducer (3-methylbenzoate) addition in the culture media. This system was standardized inside 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> by two tagged fluorescent proteins (mCherry and GFP), and this system was further utilized to totally uncouple accumulation of PHB from growth of the bacterial cells. Through tagging of Pha (3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, first step on the pathway), a variable metabolic switch at the node of acetyl-coenzyme A was so designed that the metabolic precursor can be efficiently redirected to form PHB when the system gets activated. The biologically engineered 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> strain attained an excessively high PHB accumulation specific rate of 0.4 h
 <sup>âˆ’1</sup> along with 72% (
 <italic>w/w</italic>) polymer content within glucose cultures under a growth-independent system. Therefore, FENIX allows dynamical metabolic flux control in cell factories of bacteria by initiating synthetic post-translational switches in the desired pathway.
