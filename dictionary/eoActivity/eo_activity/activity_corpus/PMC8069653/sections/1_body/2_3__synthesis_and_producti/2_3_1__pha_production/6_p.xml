<p>Simultaneous EPS and PHB production by 
 <italic>Azotobacter chroococcum</italic> and evaluation of the effects of ammonium addition with fructose, glucose, and sucrose was studied by Quagliano and Miyazaki, 1999 [
 <xref rid="B54-polymers-13-01242" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. This organism was grown aerobically in shake flasks containing the culture media along with ammonium sulphate at 30 Â°C for 72 h at 220 rpm. Sucrose was proved to be a better carbon source than glucose with higher production of PHB, whereas glucose was better source for production of EPS.
