<p>Various biochemical and physical approaches such as functional genomics, genome sequencing, and advanced molecular techniques and tools have evolved and provided more information about the detailed bacterial polymer synthesis and production pathways and processes. Enormous protein and DNA databases in combination with in silico methods provided a perception of the biosynthetic pathways and also the functions and structures of the proteins involved in such pathways. Such advanced techniques have led to the fabrication of cell factories for increased production of biopolymers or tailor-made biopolymers. Recently, approaches developed from synthetic biology using DNA foundries have led to the fabrication of cell factories, allowing precise bioengineering of producer strains [

Besides the understanding of the biosynthetic pathways and proteins, information about the molecular mechanisms of biosynthesis, modification, and secretion about the innovative tailor-made biopolymers have also come to light. For example, numerous bacterial polysaccharides have been modified enzymatically (acetylated or deactylated, phosphoethanolamine, and epimerized) at the level of polymer synthesis, and such modifications can alter the materialistic properties like gel-forming capability and visco-elasticity [

Genes that encode enzymes to be used for polymerization and alterations of polysaccharides are often co-clustered in a main single operon. Specific functional promoters regulate these operons and the transcription process of the whole biosynthetic cluster of genes (
