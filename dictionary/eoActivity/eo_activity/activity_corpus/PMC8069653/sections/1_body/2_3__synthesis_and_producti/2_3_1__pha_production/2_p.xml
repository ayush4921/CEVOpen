<p>PHAs are considered as intracellular energy and carbon storage materials, and EPS is an extracellular biosurfactant that protects the bacterial cells predation and desiccation. These biosurfactants are used in washing powders and softeners of fabric. For example, 16s rRNA analyses of the PHA-producing isolates of bacteria showed that 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp. strain-P(16) is a potential producer of PHA from low cost carbon sources like dates, rice bran, and soy molasses. The productivity of PHA from dates, rice bran, and soy molasses was found to be 82.6%, 90.9%, and 91.6% [
