<p>Bioplastics are considered as thermoplastic compounds that are easily biodegradable. They can be produced from the most natural and renewable sources. They are optically active, highly crystalline, and have piezoelectric features. They are mostly linear biopolymers such as hydroxybutyric acid and hydroxylvaleric acid. Such biopolymers are usually produced by the bacterial strain 
 <italic>Ralstonia eutropha</italic> using propionic acid and glucose as substrates. However, wild type 
 <italic>R. eutrophus</italic> utilizes fructose instead of glucose. Therefore, strains capable of utilizing glucose need to be developed for commercial uses. Bioplastic producing bacteria are grown on a large scale with high cell densities inside stirred tank fermenters by using sucrose, glucose, or molasses as carbon sources. Fed-batch systems are usually preferred over continuous systems, and they give a yield of 70â€“80% bioplastic from

Cells are harvested through flocculation or centrifugation, then recovering the bioplastics using hypochlorite and surfactants for lysing the cells and releasing the intracellular products. Processes of floatation or solvent extraction processes can be also used for bioplastic separation from intracellular products followed by lyophilization or spray drying of the cell mass. Maximum efficiency of bioplastic production can be achieved by cell pre-treatment with methylene chloride or chloroform. The composition and yield of the final product however, depend on the chosen substrate regime.
