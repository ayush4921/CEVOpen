<p>Biosurfactants are defined as amphipathic molecules having non-polar and polar heads, and they are produced by bacteria of the genera 
 <italic>Arthrobacter</italic>, 
 <italic>Acinetobacter</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic>, 
 <italic>Enetrobacter</italic>, and 
 <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B50-polymers-13-01242" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Biosurfactants are composed of a diversity of structures, as their biosynthesis is dependent on the type of carbon sources. They can be produced from different types of sources such as lipids, sugars, alkanes, and other waste products. The major feature of biosurfactant is its capacity to decrease interfacial and surface tension, producing microemulsions.
