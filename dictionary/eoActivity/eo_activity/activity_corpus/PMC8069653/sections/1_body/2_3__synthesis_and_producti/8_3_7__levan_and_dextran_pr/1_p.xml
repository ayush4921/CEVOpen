<p>Levan is formed by D-fructosyl unit polymerization linked by β-2, six linkages within linear chains with β-2, and one bond within branching points, and this polymerization reaction is carried out by the enzyme levansucrase, which is an extracellular fructosyltransferase catalyzing fructose residue transfer from sucrose to levan, thereby releasing the glucose residues. Producer organism of levan is 
 <italic>A. vinelandii</italic> strain D-08, which can grow on medium containing distillery dregs, milk whey permeate, and molasses in shake flasks at 28 °C and 250 rpm [
 <xref rid="B82-polymers-13-01242" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. This producer organism produced a levan concentration of 14 g/L (0.58 g/L/h). Another producer organism 
 <italic>Weissella cibaria</italic> strain growing on a medium containing 5% sucrose and 10% lactose produced a levan concentration of 31 g/L [
