<p>However, cultivating 
 <italic>X. campestris</italic> strain ATCC 13951 within shake flasks by using deproteinized cheese whey (CW) as the main carbon source produced a relatively low concentration of xanthan (20.3 g/L; 0.28 g/L/h) [
 <xref rid="B67-polymers-13-01242" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Experiments of optimization were done in shake flasks using 
 <italic>X. pelargonii</italic> strain PTCC 1474 and 
 <italic>X. campestris</italic> strain PTCC 1473 in a culture medium containing deproteinized CW, magnesium sulphate, and phosphorous dihydrogen sulphate [
 <xref rid="B69-polymers-13-01242" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. 
 <italic>X. pelargonii</italic> PTCC 1474 showed a relatively lower xanthan production (12.28 g/L; 0.26 g/L/h) in comparison with 
 <italic>X. campestris</italic> PTCC 1473, which showed a xanthan production of 16.65 g/L and productivity of 0.35 g/L/h. Thus, a relatively good yield was obtained with deproteinized CW for hydrolysing equimolar mixture of galactose and glucose.
