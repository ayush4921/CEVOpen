<p>Gellan is a polyfunctional gelling agent produced by a gram negative non-pathogenic bacteria 
 <italic>Sphingomonas paucimobilis</italic> strain ATCC 31461. Gellan biosyhthesis is a growth-associated process. The biosynthetic pathway for gellan production is quite complicated, where sugar precursors (UDP-glucuronate, UDP-glucose, and dTDP-rhamnose) are synthesized followed by the repeat unit formation through sequential addition of sugar donors to an active lipid carrier via glycosyltransferases and then gellan polymerization and finally export. This multistep procedure is carried out by a set of enzymes encoded by a cluster of 22 genes [

 <italic>S. paucimobilis</italic> ATCC 31461 used 2% lactose as the main carbon source (peptone and yeast extract as nitrogen sources) in shake flasks with 180 rpm produced gellan of concentration 16 g/L (0.33 g/L/h) [
