<p>Dextran is a water-soluble extracellular neutral α glucan consisting of linear chains of repeating units of D-glucopyranosyl linked with α-1, six linkages. Dextran is produced from sucrose by dextransucrase that is an extracellular glucosyltransferase catalyzing slow transfer of residues of D-glucopyranosyl from sucrose to dextran, thereby releasing residues of sucrose. Mostly, lactic acid bacteria (LAB), 
 <italic>Leuconostoc mesenteroides</italic>, is an important producer of dextran used for commercial purposes. Cane molasses or sugar beet is usually used as a medium for dextran production. 
 <italic>L. mesenteroides</italic> can grow well on medium containing whey and sucrose for a reasonable amount of time in shake flask culture at 25–27 °C and 150 rpm [
