<p>Another type of biopolymer Poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA) showed varied applications depending upon its varied molecular weights. The enhancement in the production of Poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA) can be achieved by regulation of γ-PGA depolymerase (PgdS) within Bacillus licheniformis.This can be achieved by engineering its promoter and signal peptide, thereby producing poly-γ-glutamic acid of varied molecular weight [
