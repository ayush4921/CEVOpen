<p>The enhancement in the production of bacterial biopolymer can also be achieved by the selective regulation of genes responsible for biopolymer production [
 <xref rid="B98-polymers-13-01242" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Thus, production could be enhanced by using synthetic biology technique that not only can produce improved quality of bacterial biopolymer with desired physical and chemical properties, but also help in constructing bacterial cells possessing greater yields [

 <xref rid="B100-polymers-13-01242" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. production of alginate is regulated by a regulatory circuit MucE being present on the protein associated with the outer membrane. Thus, upregulation of this circuit results in the enhancement in the production of alginate [
