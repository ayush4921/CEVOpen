<p>Sequencing of genome, cloning, functional genomics, and characterization of genes responsible for biosynthesis has immense importance in regulating the biosynthetic pathways taking place within the organisms helping in the discovery of new biopolymers having immense commercial attributes [

Metabolic engineering also plays an important role in exploiting the biosynthesis pathways within the bacterial specie, s resulting in the development of new polymers that include polythioesters and lactate-based-polymers within the recombinant
