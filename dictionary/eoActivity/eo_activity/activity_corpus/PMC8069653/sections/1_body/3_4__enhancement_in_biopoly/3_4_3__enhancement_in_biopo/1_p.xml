<p>The two most important types of bacterial biopolymer are cellulase and alginate, which are found to have numerous industrial applications. It has been observed that the market value of these two polymers is 22 billion USD per year and is projected to rise to 50 billion USD by 2025 [

 <xref rid="B96-polymers-13-01242" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. A study performed by Chen and co-workers showed that the productivity and quality of BC by Komagataeibacter xylinus ATCC 23770 was drastically enhanced by the utilization of carbon sources obtained from various plant biomass. Supplementation of bacterial growth medium with maltose and glucose resulted in a higher degree of polymerization, increased productivity, and enhanced thermal stability of the polymer, since the added saccharides helped in mimicking the lignocellulose hydrolysate that in turn led to overall enhancement in the production of the biopolymer [
