<p>In this review, we have focussed on the understanding of the various biosynthetic pathways and microbial cell-factory designing and fabrication for the production of natural and tailor-made biopolymers, respectively. Additionally, this paper also throws light on the diverse roles of these bacterial biopolymers being utilized for different industrial, geotechnical, and biomedical applications.</p>
