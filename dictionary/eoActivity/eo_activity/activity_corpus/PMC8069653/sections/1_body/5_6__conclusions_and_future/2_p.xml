<p>Non-pathogenic bacteria also produce numerous biopolymers that can be used for various biotechnological applications in medicines as well as in industries. In spite of achieving great improvements in the designing and fabrication of the cell factories for increased production of natural and tailor-made biopolymers, there still exist some limitations such as the huge cost, validation of safety profile of these biopolymers, etc. [
 <xref rid="B34-polymers-13-01242" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Due to a wide variety of interplaying componentsâ€™ multi-feedback loops in complicated bio-systems, some reasonable bioengineering strategies for new GRAS-guaranteed microbial cell factories and biopolymers are still not extensively researched. It is necessary to diminish the complicacy via systems biology in order to improve metabolic models for genome-scaling and metabolic modeling of networks, along with computational simulations involving large sets of databases feeding into synthetic biology strategies.
