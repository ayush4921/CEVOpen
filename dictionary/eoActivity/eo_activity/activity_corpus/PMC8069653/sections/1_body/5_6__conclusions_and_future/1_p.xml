<p>Extracellular biopolymers, which are produced by pathogenic bacteria, act as significant virulence factors. Thus, inhibiting their biosynthetic pathways is one of the strategies to treat infections caused by bacterial pathogens. Due to the increased degree of antimicrobial resistivity, newer strategies must be developed in order to combat bacterial infections. More studies on biopolymer synthesis, production, and regulation should be carried out to find improvised and suitable drug developing strategies such as weakening of the bacterial immune system against antimicrobial treatment or host immunity.</p>
