<p>Even though biopolymer production consumes both nutrients and chemical energy, it is supported by bacteria, since biopolymers help them grow and persist in the presence of a wide range of unfavorable conditions, such as overcoming the immune responses inside the host cells. They are involved in carrying out various other biological roles, namely protection, energy storage, and adhesion. The production of biopolymers is mainly dependent upon environmental stimuli [
 <xref rid="B10-polymers-13-01242" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The physicochemical properties of biopolymers are essential to maintain cellular behaviors like attachment over the abiotic or biotic surfaces, translocation, and shielding and endurance. Bacteria are known to produce extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) that entangle within themselves to provide a mesh like network encasing the bacterial cells. This EPS production is mainly essential in the formation of biofilms, which are referred to as potentially structured communities of bacterial cells [
 <xref rid="B11-polymers-13-01242" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and these communities are considered to be one of the most persistent forms of life on Earth. EPS are the biopolymers that are synthesized by several strains of microorganisms, providing structural stability and nutrients during adhesion of the sessile microcolonies and the development of the biofilm. EPS produced by the microbial communities vary greatly in their biochemical composition, thus exhibiting varying chemical and physical properties. Some of these can be polyanionic, whereas others can be polycationic in nature [
 <xref rid="B12-polymers-13-01242" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The complex arrangement of structural units inside the EPS has been studied for decades. The macromolecules that are predominantly available within the EPS comprise of polysaccharides, proteins, peptidoglycans, lipids, enzymes, and extracellular DNA (eDNA). Nuclease that is present within the EPS acts as an important regulator for the formation of the biofilm [
 <xref rid="B13-polymers-13-01242" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The polysaccharides are a widely studied component of EPS. The analysis of various polysaccharides obtained from varied microbial species show that they vary largely in their composition and are made up of one or more different structural components with varied arrangement in EPS [
 <xref rid="B14-polymers-13-01242" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The commonly found polysaccharides within the EPS are highly soluble in salt solution and water. The polysaccharides forming the capsule help in adherence to the cell surface via covalent bonds with the other polymers that are present upon the surface. The extracellular polysaccharides are insoluble and cannot be separated from the cells, thereby making the determination of physical and chemical properties difficult. As the formation of biofilms serves as the main platform for the development of chronic infections [
 <xref rid="B15-polymers-13-01242" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], there are many pieces of research to understand the function of bacterial biopolymers in the formation of biofilms leading to pathogenesis. These biopolymers produced by bacterial cellular pathways and their biological roles have been considered as potential targets for the development of new antibacterial drugs.
