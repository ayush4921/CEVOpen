<p>Besides these, researches are still going on to harness the novel materialistic properties of these bacterial biopolymers like dextran [

 <xref rid="B17-polymers-13-01242" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], polyesters [
 <xref rid="B18-polymers-13-01242" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and xanthan [
 <xref rid="B19-polymers-13-01242" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] to be used in industries to produce medicines and other materials. Over the last few years, advanced molecular methodologies and genome sequencing have provided a large amount of information regarding the role of bacterial biopolymers to cause pathogenesis and also to devise bacteria to be used as cell factories producing tailor-made biomaterials. These biodegradable and renewable materials have the potential to replace the oil-based type of materials and can also be exploited to develop novel high-end biomaterials in order to provide treatments for unfulfilled medical requirements, because these materials are frequently biocompatible. Thus, this review focuses on the bacterial pathway for polymer biosynthesis and its potential role in causing pathogenesis, as well as how it can have diverse industrial, technical, and medical applications.
