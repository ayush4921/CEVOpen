<p>Biopolymers are polymers being synthesized by living organisms with the help of enzymes that connects the building blocks like sugars, hydroxyl fatty acids, and amino acids to produce molecules with high molecular weight. Bacteria produce a diverse variety of biopolymers like polyamides (amino acids linked by peptide bonds), polysaccharides (sugars or sugar acids linked by glycosidic bonds), polyphosphates (inorganic phosphates connected by anhydride bonds), and polyesters (hydroxyl fatty acids connected by ester bonds). Over a long period of time, scientists have tried to understand the pathways involved in the biosynthesis of biopolymers, since they are involved in bacterial pathogenesis and persistence. These polymers can act as shielding capsules to protect the cells and storage components and form the matrix component involved in biofilm formation that causes almost 60â€“80% of total human infections [

Over the recent few years, bioengineering and synthetic biological methods helped to produce new biopolymers having potential usage in medicines (like hyaluronate that acts as a biomaterial), ingredients in various food materials (Chitosan, dextran, and xanthan), and production of polyester that is used in packaging [
