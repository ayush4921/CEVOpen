<p>The RAW264.7 cell suspensions (100 μL) were added to each well at the density of 2 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells per well and allowed to grow for 24 h. After removing the medium, the cells were incubated with 100 μL of two-fold serially diluted EO solution for 2 h. Then, 100μL lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was added to the final concentration of 1 μg/mL and incubated for another 24 h. Morphological changes of the treated RAW264.7 cells were recorded using an inverted microscope (Leica DMi8, Leica Microsystems, Germany). Subsequently, the supernatants were collected and centrifuged. The accumulation amount of NO in the supernatant was detected using a colorimetric NO detection kit following the manufacturer’s instructions (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China). The secretion of IL-6 and TNF-α was determined using respective ELISA determination kits according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Multi Sciences Biotech Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, China). Dexamethasone (DXM) (20 μg/mL) was used as a positive control.
