<p>The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) values were evaluated by the microplate dilution method [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-26-00167" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Briefly, the two-fold serially diluted sample solution (100 μL) and the bacterial suspensions (100 μL) were added to each well at the final density of 10
 <sup>5</sup> CFU/mL. The 96-well plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Then, 20 μL of resazurin solution (0.1 mg/mL) was added to each well and incubated for 2 h in the dark at 37 °C. The MIC was determined as the minimum sample concentration without color change. For the determination of MBC value, the sample (10 μL) from the wells without color change was subcultured in a Mueller–Hinton agar plate for 24 h at 37 °C. MBC was defined as the minimum sample concentration without bacterial growth.
