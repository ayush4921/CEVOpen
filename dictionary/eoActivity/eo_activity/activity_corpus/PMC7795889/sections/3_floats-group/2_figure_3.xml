  <p>Effects of 
   <italic>R. beesianus</italic> rhizome EO on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced morphology (200×) (
   <bold>A</bold>), nitric oxide (NO) production (
   <bold>B</bold>), and secretion of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-
   <italic>α</italic>) (
   <bold>C</bold>) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) (
   <bold>D</bold>) in RAW264.7 macrophages. (
   <bold>A</bold>) The RAW 264.7 macrophages were exposed to different EO concentrations and in the presence or absence of LPS (1 μg/mL). After 24 h of incubation, the images of RAW 264.7 cells were taken. (
   <bold>B</bold>) The RAW 264.7 cells were exposed to different EO concentrations and stimulated with LPS. Dexamethasone (DXM, 20 μg/mL) was used as a positive control. The accumulation of NO in the culture supernatants was assayed by the Griess reaction. (
   <bold>C</bold>, 
   <bold>D</bold>) The RAW 264.7 cells were exposed to different EO concentrations and stimulated with LPS. The amount of TNF-
   <italic>α</italic> (
   <bold>C</bold>) and IL-6 (
   <bold>D</bold>) was determined using respective ELISA determination kits. The experiments were performed independently at least three times, and the data were expressed as the mean ± SD values. The different letters above bars indicate a significant difference (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).
