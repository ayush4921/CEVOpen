<p>The community of bacterial endophytes is influenced by both biotic and abiotic factors, which shape their species composition, community structure, diversity, and functions (
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">Walitang et al., 2018</xref>). Environmental factors not only affect the distribution of a medicinal plant, but also determine the species of bacterial endophyte which can colonize host plant throughout its life cycle (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Deng et al., 2011</xref>). Endophyte diversity is also influenced by host plant characteristics, including genotype (

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Dai et al., 2014</xref>), growth stage (age) (
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">Vendan et al., 2010</xref>), and health status (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Bogas et al., 2015</xref>). The non-random distribution of endophytic bacterial species thus provides clues as to their biology and ecology. However, there is limited information on the plant and environmental factors that shape endophytic bacterial community structure and how endophytes regulate their hosts by synthesizing primary and secondary metabolites.
