<p>Crop pests and diseases are among the most significant causes of economic losses in agriculture, and at least one study has demonstrated a correlation between the bioactive compounds produced by endophytic bacteria and host plant disease tolerance (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Bibi et al., 2012</xref>). Likewise, certain endophytic bacteria from 
 <italic>Panax ginseng</italic>, termed pathogen antagonists, demonstrate antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> and 
 <italic>Cylindrocarpon destructans</italic>, as well as hydrogen cyanide production 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (

 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp. can impede the growth of soil pathogens (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Paulin et al., 2009</xref>). Endophytic bacteria might protect medicinal plants from pathogens through various mechanisms, including displacing them from their ecological niche within plant tissues and producing antibiotics that directly inhibit their growth (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Lacava and Azevedo, 2013</xref>). In addition, 
 <italic>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</italic> Fy11 appears to suppress 
 <italic>Phytophthora</italic> blight on pepper indirectly by promoting induced systemic resistance (ISR) (
