<p>Previous studies have shown that the synthesis of multiple bioactive secondary metabolites, including alkaloids, sesquiterpenes, polyketones, lactones, organic acids, cyclopeptides, flavonoids, and saponins, with novel applications can be accomplished by endophytes present in host plants (

Endophytes are extremely crucial biological resources, the exploration of which in the future can facilitate environmental sustainability, and they can act as unlimited biomolecule sources for various industrial sectors and benefiting human health. Therefore, it is essential to investigate their genomics as well as the integrated metabolism of endophyte-host plant relationship. Furthermore, it is recommended to deduce the biochemical and physiological characteristics of these endophytes at genomic and metabolomic levels, respectively. To date, no database is exclusively available for endophytes and their metabolites, and the building of which is of great importance in providing solutions for all the aforementioned issues.
