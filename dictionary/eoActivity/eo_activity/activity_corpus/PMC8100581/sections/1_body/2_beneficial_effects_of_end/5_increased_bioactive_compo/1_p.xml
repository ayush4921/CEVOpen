<p>Research on endophytic bacterial contribution to their medicinal host plant metabolism is complicated by the fact that some secondary metabolites may be produced by the combined activity of both the bacteria and the host (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Brader et al., 2014</xref>). Some endophytic bacteria are known to induce the production of secondary metabolites in medicinal plants (
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">Tiwari et al., 2010</xref>). For example, 
 <italic>Bacillus altitudinis</italic> KX230132.1 serves as an effective elicitor that increases ginsenoside concentrations in the valuable medicinal herb, ginseng (
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, such elicitors may also participate directly in the biochemical transformation of active ingredients in medicinal plants. Previous work has demonstrated that 
 <italic>Burkholderia</italic> sp. GE 17-7 can convert the major ginsenoside Rb1 into the minor ginsenoside Rg3, which may possess practical importance to develop the antitumor compound ginsenoside Rg3 (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Fu et al., 2018</xref>). Such biotransformations using endophytic bacteria have significant potential for promoting the accumulation of rare active ingredients in medicinal plants. However, the specific mechanisms by which endophytic bacteria regulate plant physiology and metabolism remain unknown. Likewise, the processes by which they use intermediate compounds of primary and secondary metabolism as nutrients and precursors for producing new compounds or enhancing existing metabolites are poorly understood.
