<p>Our survey and analysis have documented the presence of mutually beneficial relationships between bacterial endophytes and 86 medicinal plants from 40 families (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Surveyed plants included Amaranthaceae (2 taxa), Amaryllidaceae (1 taxon), Anacardiaceae (1 taxon), Apiaceae (4 taxa), Apocynaceae (1 taxon), Araceae (1 taxon), Araliaceae (2 taxa), Asteraceae (11 taxa), Berberidaceae (1 taxon), Brassicaceae (2 taxa), Cactaceae (1 taxon), Caprifoliaceae (1 taxon), Celastraceae (2 taxa), Chenopodiaceae (3 taxa), Dryopteridaceae (1 taxon), Euphorbiaceae (4 taxa), Fabaceae (11 taxa), Ginkgoaceae (1 taxon), Lamiaceae (7 taxa), Lauraceae (2 taxa), Liliaceae (2 taxa), Meliaceae (1 taxon), Moraceae (2 taxa), Myrtaceae (1 taxon), Orchidaceae (1 taxon), Plantaginaceae (1 taxon), Poaceae (4 taxa), Polygonaceae (1 taxon), Pteridaceae (1 taxon), Rosaceae (1 taxon), Rubiaceae (2 taxa), Sapindaceae (2 taxa), Sarraceniaceae (1 taxon), Saururaceae (1 taxon), Theaceae (2 taxa), Thymelaeaceae (1 taxon), Ulmaceae (1 taxon), Vitaceae (1 taxon), Winteraceae (1 taxon), and Zingiberaceae (2 taxa). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, the medicinal plants we surveyed were mainly distributed in Asia and Europe; there were a few studies on medicinal plant endophytes from North America and Australia, but none from extreme regions. Future research should focus on endophytic bacteria and medicinal plants in areas where there has been relatively less research. A total of 11 orders and 88 genera of endophytic bacteria had documented associations with medicinal plants in the literature. The most common orders were Bacillales, Enterobacterales, and Pseudomonadales, which accounted for 72.62%. The most common genera were 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic>, 
 <italic>Pantoea</italic> and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, which accounted for 58.92%. 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> are widely reported as promoting the growth and development of plants, and 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and 
 <italic>Paenibacillus</italic> can influence the growth, stress resistance and metabolism of medicinal plants (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Qi et al., 2021</xref>). Based on the information collected above, we suggest that future studies prioritize exploring these beneficial endophytic bacteria. However, such endophytic bacteria mentioned in the literature have been isolated by culture techniques. Our present understanding of medicinal plant endophytes derives almost entirely from culture-based diversity analyses (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2017</xref>), though most of the environmental bacteria are unculturable. This constraint limits our understanding of medicinal plant endophytic bacteria and the influence of plant hosts on the structure of bacterial community: the impact of unculturable bacteria on host plant responses should focus on future research.
