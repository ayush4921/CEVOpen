<p>Endophytic bacteria are potential candidates to promote the growth of medicinal plants, such as to enhance root and shoot biomass and stimulate seed germination (
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">Vendan et al., 2010</xref>). Previously, they were reported to increase the growth of plants through the synthesis of indole acetic acid (IAA) (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Fouda et al., 2021</xref>). In particular, microbial synthesis of IAA by the tryptophan-dependent pathway can affect the growth of plants (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Gravel et al., 2007</xref>). However, the underlying mechanisms have primarily been studied 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, and future studies need to investigate specific metabolites and mechanisms of growth promotion during the actual interaction between the endophytic bacterium and its host. One bacterial endophyte, 
 <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> AL2-16, can fix nitrogen in 
 <italic>Achyranthes aspera</italic> by capturing atmospheric N and converting it into an available nitrogen form through enzymatic reduction (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Devi et al., 2016</xref>). Wheat seedlings inoculated with a 
 <italic>Paenibacillus ehimensis</italic> strain from 
 <italic>Lonicera japonica</italic> showed marked increases in growth associated with greater photosynthetic carbon uptake and light use efficiency (
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, multiple other benefits on the growth of plants that are attributed to endophytes include modification of root morphology, osmotic adjustment, phosphate siderophore production improvement, solubilization activity enhancement, and stomatal regulation (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Compant et al., 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">Zhu, 2019</xref>). These plant growth-promotive bacterial endophytes are presently used for forest regeneration and contaminated soil phytoremediation (
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">Ryan et al., 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2020</xref>). However, these studies only applied single bacterial strains. The combined effects of endophytic bacterial population should be further studied.
