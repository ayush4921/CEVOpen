<p>There is evidence suggesting that resistant peach cultivars harbor a greater abundance and diversity of bacterial endophytes and more bacterial antagonists of the pathogen 
 <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> bacterial community may constitute an important component of their 
 <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> resistance (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Li Q. et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, numerous non-medicinal plants take use of endophytic bacterial consortia or the combinations of other microorganisms and/or inhibitors to combat harmful phytopathogens as well as enhance their growth (

 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">Sundaramoorthy, 2012</xref>). Therefore, further 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> development of endophyte-plant models is essential. As a matter of fact, although several crop microbiota have been investigated in detail for examining their interactions with the respective hosts, medicinal plant model systems are still missing. The complementary information obtained from modern “omics” studies combining with other system biological techniques are crucial for establishing models in predicting and explaining endophyte-mediated processes (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Kaul et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, the market-oriented application of biological control agents is essential as well, though a series of issues need repetitive examination, such as the effects of complex external condition alterations, the best application time of endophytes, and the potential pathogenicity of endophytes under condition changes (30). There is a dynamic, intricate intermingling of multiple bacterial species with the host plant, and significant research will be required to fully understand the effects of these complex relationships on host plant disease resistance.
