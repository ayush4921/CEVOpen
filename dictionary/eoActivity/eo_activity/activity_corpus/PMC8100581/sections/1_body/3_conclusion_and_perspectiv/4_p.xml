<p>Plants have evolved through continuous interaction with microbes, and it is evident that endophytic bacteria play significant roles in improving plant survival and adaptation (
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al., 2017</xref>). This review outlines the biotic and abiotic factors that influence community structure and endophytic bacterial distribution and summarizes the beneficial effects of endophytes on their host plants. Such information provides a foundation for further studies and can be applied to obtain better bioactive materials from medicinal plants.
