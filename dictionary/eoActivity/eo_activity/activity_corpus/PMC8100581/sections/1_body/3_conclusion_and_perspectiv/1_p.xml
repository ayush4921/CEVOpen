<p>The genotype, morphology, life history, and health status of medicinal plants can affect the composition, distribution, and structure of their endophytic bacterial community through various physiological mechanisms. Therefore, individual plants have unique endophytic bacteria or bacterial communities, which may inhabit specific plant tissues depending on their roles or preferred niches. On the other hand, the distribution and community structure of bacterial endophytes are also strongly influenced by the external environment (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Mitter et al., 2013</xref>): temperature, humidity, illumination, and geographic location all determine the distribution of medicinal plants and in turn influence their associated endophytic bacterial species. A better understanding on the influences of the external environment on specific endophytic bacteria will allow us to maximize plant benefits by appropriately modifying external conditions after inoculation.
