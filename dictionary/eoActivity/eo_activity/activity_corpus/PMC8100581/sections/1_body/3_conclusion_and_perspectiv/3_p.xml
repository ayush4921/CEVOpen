<p>Research on beneficial bacterial strains has been primarily limited to laboratory studies, and future research should therefore focus more on field experiments and practical applications to obtain higher quality medicinal plants. Moreover, we know little about the mechanisms of endophytic bacteria-medicinal plants interactions. In the coming decades, we recommend several priority topics for additional research: (1) the development of innovative approaches for the separation and cultivation of endophytic bacteria in order to build a functional library of endophytic bacteria and investigate the effects of unculturable endophytes on medicinal plants; (2) studies on the effects of endophytic bacterial communities on medicinal plants; (3) artificial transformation of functional bacteria to give them additional beneficial functions; (4) strategies to establish symbiotic endophyte-host plant associations, and simulation of the symbiotic vs. parasitic relationships between endophytic bacteria and medicinal plants; (5) transmission mode (endophytes are transmitted vertically as well from plant reproductive tissues to the next generation), and (6) explorations of the mechanisms by which Dao-di medicinal materials are formed, with an emphasis on the role of endophytic bacterial community structure.</p>
