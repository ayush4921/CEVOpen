<p>The relationship between host plants and specific endophytic bacterial isolates may exhibit characteristics of either parasitism or mutualism, depending on host genotype, tissue, and health status (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Cope-Selby et al., 2017</xref>), and multiple studies showed that endophytic bacterial communities are considerably affected by their host plants. A study in the Patagonian ecosystem showed that bacterial abundance and diversity were higher on 
 <italic>Hieracium pilosella</italic> than on 
 <italic>Gaultheria mucronata</italic> (
 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>), a result consistent with the assumption that the diverse physiological structures, metabolites, and growth habits of different plants affect their ability to recruit various endophytic bacteria (

 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Campisano et al., 2014</xref>). Host plant health status also influences endophyte colonization: the bacterial endophytic community of 
 <italic>Paullinia cupana</italic> with asymptomatic anthracnose comprised mainly Firmicutes, whereas that of plants with symptomatic anthracnose comprised mainly Acidobacteria (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Bogas et al., 2015</xref>). Such results may reflect pathogen-mediated surface damage to the host, promoting the establishment of some endophytes and disrupting the original stable microbial ecological environment (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Hallmann et al., 1998</xref>). In one study, PCR-based molecular techniques were employed to investigate the cultivable bacteria isolated from the leaf, root, and stem compartments of 
 <italic>Echinacea angustifolia</italic> (DC.) Hell and 
 <italic>Echinacea purpurea</italic> (L.) Moench, which demonstrated that these two medicinal plants and the respective compartments possessed different types of bacterial communities, suggesting the strong selective pressure and the low-degree strain sharing in the plant tissues (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Chiellini et al., 2014</xref>). These differences might be attributed to differential nutritional and environmental conditions to which the aerial parts and the roots of the plants were exposed, or due to the phytochemical and anatomical features, which in turn established particular ecological niches for the endophytes. Endophytic bacteria are possibly selected based on their strategies for adaptation and the tolerance under differential conditions in a variety of plant compartments. The differences in the medicinal properties can be explained by the presence of distinct bacterial communities in differential plant species and among the compartments of a single plant species. In general, endophytic bacteria can adjust their structure and diversity in response to different plant genotypes, organs, health statuses, and growth stages in order to obtain a consistent supply of nutrients. Moreover, in an olive system, it was found that belowground communities of endophytic bacteria were mainly determined by the cultivar genotype grown under same agronomic, environmental, and pedological conditions, indicating that the plant genotype serves as a main factor to shape the belowground bacterial communities of olive (
