<p>The community structure of endophytic bacteria is affected by multiple external factors, including season, altitude, latitude, longitude, and soil conditions (

 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). For example, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria were the most abundant endophytic bacteria of mulberry (
 <italic>Morus</italic> L.) in the spring, whereas only Proteobacteria were found in the fall. The spring endophytic bacteria were also characterized by greater diversity and a larger number of species (Shannon, 14.00; Simpson, 0.30; Chao, 1018) compared with autumn endophytes (Shannon, 6.62; Simpson, 1.26; Chao, 654) (

 <italic>Pyrus ussuriensi</italic> community structure substantially correlated to the carbon, nitrogen, pH, and temperature of soil. In particular, the richness and diversity of root endophytic bacteria increased with increased nitrogen content (

 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al. (2014)</xref> reported that soil water content and annual precipitation were strongly correlated with the endophytic bacterial RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism) type variation in 
 <italic>Caragana jubata</italic> and 
 <italic>Oxytropis ochrocephala</italic>, followed by latitude, longitude, soil nitrogen content, and soil potassium content (
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). Bacterial endophyte community structure changes with changing environmental conditions and the maintenance of a shifting and diverse endophytic community may form part of the physiological strategy by which plants adapt to their environment.
