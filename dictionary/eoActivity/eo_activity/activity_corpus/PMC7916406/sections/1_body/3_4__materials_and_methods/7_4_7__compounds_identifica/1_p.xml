<p>The quantitative and qualitative identification of the volatile secondary metabolites present in 
 <italic>Piper carpunya</italic> leaves and guaviduca beverage was carried out using gas chromatography (GC). Quantitative analyses were carry out using an Agilent gas chromatograph (model 6890N series) equipped with a flame ionization detector (GC/FID) according to the procedure described by Valarezo et al. [
 <xref rid="B53-plants-10-00338" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The relative amounts of individual components were calculated based on the GC peak area (FID response) without using a correction factor. For quantitative analysis, an external calibration curve was used. The calibration curve was obtained by injecting six dilutions of limonene. The dilutions were obtained by diluting 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 5, and 10 mg of limonene to 10 mL with dichloromethane. The calibration curve achieved a R
 <sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.99. Qualitative analyses were performed using an Agilent gas chromatograph (model 6890N series, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) coupled to a mass spectrometer (quadrupole) detector (model Agilent series 5973 inert) (GC/MS) (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) as per the procedures described earlier by Valarezo et al. [

 <xref rid="B56-plants-10-00338" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. For qualitative and quantitative analyses, an automatic injector (Agilent 7683 automatic liquid sampler, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and a nonpolar column (J&amp;W DB-5ms Ultra Inert GC column: 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) were used.
