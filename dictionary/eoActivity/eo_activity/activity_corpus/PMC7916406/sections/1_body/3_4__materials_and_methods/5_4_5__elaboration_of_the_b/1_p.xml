<p>The preparation of the guaviduca beverage was carried out according to the indications of the members of the El Kiim community. We placed 32 g of fresh guaviduca leaves (between two and three leaves of PCS) into 1 L of boiling water. The cooking process was immediately stopped (infusion), then the leaves were mixed with the water, and allowed to cool in a closed container. The container was periodically shaken lightly. The infusion rested until it reached room temperature (20 °C) and was then filtered through a sieve mesh (850 μm) (No. 20 ASTM E11). The liquid fraction was stored in airtight amber containers at 4 °C (refrigeration) until being used in the subsequent analysis.</p>
