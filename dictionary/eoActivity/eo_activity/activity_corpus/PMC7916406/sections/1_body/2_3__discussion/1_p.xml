<p>Various compounds identified in the present investigation, such as 1,8-cineole (13.0%), safrole (14.9%), and spatulenol (9.8%), were also identified as major compounds in a study carried out on essential oil from leaves of 
 <italic>P. carpunya</italic> species grown in the Peruvian Amazon [
 <xref rid="B13-plants-10-00338" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] (the stage is not specified), although, with different percentages. In 2019, Ballesteros et al. determined that 
 <italic>P. carpunya</italic> essential oil collected in the balsamic period (before flowering) in the Kutuku Experimental Station, Morona Santiago province, Ecuador, is mainly composed of piperitone (26.2%). According to reports, this oil only contains 2.2% of safrole and 4% of 1,8-cineole [
 <xref rid="B7-plants-10-00338" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Piperitone (33.97%), 1,8 cineole (11.92%), limonene (11.07%), and safrole (8.18%) were identified as major constituents of an essential oil of this species collected in July (the stage is not specified) in Guayas, an Ecuadorian coastal province [
 <xref rid="B6-plants-10-00338" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The chemical composition of the essential oils of the same species varies in terms of intrinsic and extrinsic factors [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-10-00338" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. For this reason, the chemical composition of the compounds in the 
 <italic>P. carpunya</italic> leaves was determined as the source of the compounds present in the beverage.
