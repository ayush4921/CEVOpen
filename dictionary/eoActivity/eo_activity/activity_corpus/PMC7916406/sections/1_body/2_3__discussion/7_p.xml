<p>On the other hand, in vitro and in vivo assays showed that the 
 <italic>P. carpunya</italic> extract affects the action of neutrophils, reducing the release of myeloperoxidase enzymes which are involved in the pro-inflammatory activity. In addition, 
 <italic>P. carpunya</italic> extract was involved in the preservation of antioxidant enzyme activity in mucosa exposed to damage [

 <italic>P. carpunya</italic>, which have potent antioxidant free radical scavenging activities. Antioxidant activity is one of the proposed mechanisms of action for establishing anti-inflammatory properties [
