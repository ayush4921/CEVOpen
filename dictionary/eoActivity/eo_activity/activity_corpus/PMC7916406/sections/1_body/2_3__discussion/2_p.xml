 <xref rid="plants-10-00338-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), are also present, in different concentrations, in the guaviduca beverage. However, the composition of the beverage is more closely related to the composition of the essential oil extracted from the leaves collected in the summer, which shows that the compounds present in the beverage are similar qualitatively to those in the leaves used to make it. In the case of the guaviduca beverage, which is consumed mainly for its anti-inflammatory properties, 1,8-cineole (eucalyptol) is present, which, due to its anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, broncholytic, and mucolytic properties, is used to treat diseases of the respiratory tract [

 <xref rid="B24-plants-10-00338" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] stated that 1,8-cineole caused repletion of glutathione and reduced myeloperoxidase activity, which causes reduction of colon inflammation in rats, confirming that 1,8-cineole has an anti-inflammatory action and suggesting its potential use in the prevention of ulceration and gastrointestinal inflammation as a dietary flavoring agent. 1,8-Cineole produced a notable increase in glucuronyltransferase activity when it was given via food/water to rats for 4 days or by aerosol for 5–8 days in doses of 500 mg/kg/day or 1000 mg/kg/day. This increase returned to normal after 20 days [

 <xref rid="B25-plants-10-00338" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In their study, Yokota et al. established that eugenol dose-dependently increased levels of hepatic UDP-glucuronyltransferase when given in the diet at 1%, 3%, or 5% for 23 days. The antiulcer, antidiarrheal, and antiparasitic capacity associated with the guaviduca beverage may be due to the presence of β-ocimene (E and Z), which is associated with EOs with anticonvulsant activity, antifungal activity, antitumor activity, and pest resistance [
