<p>The 
 <italic>P. carpunya</italic> essential oil was assessed for its anticholinesterase potential by measuring the rate of reaction of AChE against three different concentrations of the essential oil (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00338-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The IC
 <sub>50</sub> value obtained for guaviduca EO was 36.42 ± 1.15 µg/mL, which can be considered to be very strong as compared with the related EO from 
 <italic>Piper</italic> spp., such as 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>betle</italic>, 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>asutrosinense</italic>, 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>puberulum</italic>, 
 <italic>P. flaviflorum</italic>, and 
 <italic>P hispidimervium</italic>, in which the inhibition of AChE ranged from 12.4 mg/mL to 1.5 mg/mL as reported by Xiang et al. [

 <sub>50</sub> value of 13.80 ± 1.01 nM. In traditional Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine practices, plants have been extensively used for cognitive disorder treatments, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized mainly by impaired memory and behavior. According to the cholinergic hypothesis, memory impairment in patients suffering AD results from a deficit in cholinergic function in the brain [

To date, only tacrine, donepezil, rivastigmine, and galanthamine have been approved by the FDA for AD symptomatic treatment [
