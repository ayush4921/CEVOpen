<p>The main constituent of the essential oil was 1,8-cineole (CAS 470-82-6) 25.20 ± 1.31% in PCW and 17.45 ± 2.33% in PCS. Safrole (CAS 94-59-7) was the second compound with the highest percentage in the PCW oil with 21.91 ± 2.79%, and the third in the PCS oil with 13.18 ± 1.72%. The other main compounds were germacrene D (6.67 ± 0.44), α-terpinene (5.90 ± 0.44), and (E)-β-ocimene (5.66 ± 0.53) in the PCW oil, and (E)-β-ocimene (15.50 ± 2.53), (Z)-β-ocimene (9.45 ± 1.74), and α-Terpinene (8.93 ± 1.29) in the PCS EO. In the guaviduca beverage, compounds of the same chemical nature (monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes) as in the PCW and PCS essential oil samples were determined. The compounds with the highest abundance were 1,8-cineole with a concentration of around 14 mg/L, (E)-β-ocimene at 2.67 ± 0.13 mg/L, and safrole at 2.43 ± 0.12 mg/L.</p>
