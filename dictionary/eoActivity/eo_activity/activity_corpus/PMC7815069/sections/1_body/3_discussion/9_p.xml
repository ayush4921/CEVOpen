<p>Nerolidol, a terpenoid commonly found in many plants exerts antileishmanial activity against 
 <italic>L. amazonensis</italic> via inhibition of various biochemical pathways such as biosynthesis of dolichol, ergosterol, and ubiquinones.
 <xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> In addition, a triterpenoid dihydrobetulinic acid inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>L. donovani</italic> amastigotes by targeting DNA topoisomerase I and II preventing DNA cleavage via forming enzymeâ€“DNA complex, leading to apoptosis. Thus, the antileishmanial activity of the plant extracts, which are rich in phenols, flavonoids and terpenoids, may possibly be due to the specific components and/or synergistic interaction among various principles.
