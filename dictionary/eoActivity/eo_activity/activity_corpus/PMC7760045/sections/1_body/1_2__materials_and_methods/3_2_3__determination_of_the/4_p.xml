<p>The FIC is calculated by comparing the MIC of each EO alone with the combination-derived MIC. The synergistic effect of EOs in the mixture is at FICI values ≤ 0.5, nonsynergistic or additive action is at values in the range 1 ≥ FICI &gt; 0.5, and FICI values between 1 and 4 indicate a neutral effect. A FICI &gt; 4 indicates antagonistic activity of EOs in the mixture [
