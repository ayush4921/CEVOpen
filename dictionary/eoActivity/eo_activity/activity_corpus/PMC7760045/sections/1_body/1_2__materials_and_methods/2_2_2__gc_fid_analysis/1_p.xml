<p>The quantitative GC-FID (gas chromatograph coupled with a flame ionization detector) analysis was carried out using a Hewlett Packard 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and capillary, polar column HP 20M (25 m × 0.32 mm × 0.3 µm film thickness). The analysis was performed using the following temperature program: oven temperature isotherm at 60 °C for 2 min, then it was programmed from 60 to 220 °C at a rate of 4 °C per min and held isothermal at 220 °C for 5 min. Injector and detector temperatures were, respectively, at 220 and 260 °C. The carrier gas (He) flow was 1.1 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup>. The split ratio was 1:500. Manual injection of 0.3 µL of essential oil was applied. Component identification was confirmed by comparison of their retention times with those of pure authentic samples and by means of their linear retention indices (RI) relative to the series of 
 <italic>n</italic>-hydrocarbons (C7-C30), under the same operating conditions. RI were compared with those reported in the literature [
