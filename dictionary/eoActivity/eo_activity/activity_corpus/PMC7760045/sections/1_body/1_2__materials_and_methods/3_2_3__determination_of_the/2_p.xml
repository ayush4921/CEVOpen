<p>Next, 380 μL of TSB containing EOs separately or mixtures at different concentrations and 20 μL of inoculum 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> were transferred to wells of a sterile Honeycomb plate (Thermo Scientific, Warsaw, Poland). In each well, the initial number of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> was approximately 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> CFU mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. Strain growth control was performed in TBS (without EO) with the 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> inoculum. The negative control was TBS without EO and bacterial inoculum. The Honeycomb 2 plates were placed on a Bioscreen C apparatus (OY Growth Curves Ab Ltd., Turku, Finland) and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Plates were shaken before measurement and the automatic optical density (OD) was measured at λ 600 nm every 1 h. A smaller change in OD value than 0.2 (∆OD &lt; 0.2) at the initial and final incubation hours was considered as no test strain growth. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the EO or mixture of EOs was defined as the lowest concentration at which there was no growth of the test strain. Three independent series of experiments in triplicate were performed.
