<p>The use of EOs to protect against the development of pathogens is only possible if such a product is accepted by consumers. The odor and taste of essential oils have been mostly determined by their chemical composition [
 <xref rid="B24-foods-09-01740" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. SOO with a high content of phenol monoterpenes, mainly carvacrol, had a sharp spicy flavor and taste, while SMO was distinguished by a pleasant, spicy odor and taste. CO displayed the worst characteristics, because it had a sweet, slightly spicy odor and a bitter taste. Mixtures of EOs in a ¼ MIC + ¼ MIC combination added to vegetables were in very low concentrations (SOO 0.0225%, SMO 0.225% and CO 0.1%). The better antilisterial, i.e., the SOO + CO mixture, has poorer sensory characteristics than the SOO + SMO mixture added to fresh vegetables. The odor and taste of SOO + SMO were minimally perceptible compared to the control, making vegetables with this mixture just as acceptable as vegetables without EOs. Similar results were obtained by Yamazaki et al. [

Such combinations allow for a reduction of the dosage of EO used in food preservation and thereby reduce the development of undesirable flavors in the final product.
