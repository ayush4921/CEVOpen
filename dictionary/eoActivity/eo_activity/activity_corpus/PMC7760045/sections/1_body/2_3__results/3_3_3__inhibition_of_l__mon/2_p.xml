<p>A FICI value of 0.5 (
 <xref rid="foods-09-01740-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) was observed only for two mixtures, SOO + SMO and SOO + CO in a ¼ MIC + ¼ MIC combination, suggesting a synergistic effect of the components of the EOs in these combinations against 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>. The FICI value of 0.75 revealed the additive effect of SOO + SMO and SOO + CO in a ½ MIC + ¼ MIC combination. The SOO + SMO mixture in the combination ½ MIC + ⅛ MIC also had an additive effect (FICI 0.625). In turn, the interaction of essential oils in SOO + SMO, SOO + CO and CO + SMO mixtures in a ½ MIC + ½ MIC combination was neutral in relation to 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>. The combination of CO and SMO at sub-inhibitory concentrations (¼ MIC + ¼ MIC or ¼ MIC + ⅛ MIC) did not inhibit the growth of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>.
