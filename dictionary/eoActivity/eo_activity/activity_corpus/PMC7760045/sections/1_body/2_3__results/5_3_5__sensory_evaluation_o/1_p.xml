<p>The results of sensory analysis of the mixture of vegetables treated with EOs at 1 MIC and their mixtures at a ¼ MIC + ¼ MIC combination are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01740-f003">Figure 3</xref>. Treatment of the vegetable mixture with EOs or SOO + CO and SOO + SMO mixtures did not have a significant effect (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) on color or texture, but it statistically (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) significantly affected the odor, taste and overall quality assessment, which reduced the desirability of these vegetables (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01740-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). Lower scores for these descriptors were obtained for samples treated by EOs alone than by mixtures of EOs. The sample treated with SOO + SMO in a ¼ MIC+ ¼ MIC combination had the highest overall quality. The average scores for all descriptors of this sample did not differ significantly statistically (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) from the control sample. The CO-treated sample at 1 MIC had the lowest average odor and taste scores, which significantly reduced the desirability of this sample.
