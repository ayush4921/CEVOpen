<p>The inactivation of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> in the vegetable filtrate with EOs at 1 MIC alone or with the mixtures of EOs at ¼ MIC + ¼ MIC is shown in 
 <xref rid="foods-09-01740-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. The initial number of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> in the control was 5.8 log CFU mL
 <sup>−1</sup> and increased by three log cycles after 24 h. The addition to the vegetable filtrate of SOO at 1 MIC reduced the number of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> approximately by five log cycles after 4 h. CO and SMO at 1 MIC had a weaker antilisterial effect, because it reduced the number of bacteria by 3.5 and 2.3 log cycles after 4 h. In the vegetable filtrate with the addition of EOs alone at 1 MIC, it was found that the number of viable 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> cells was at the limit of detection (&lt;1 log CFU × mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) after 24 h.
