<p>Listeriosis caused by 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> is still a rare disease in humans; however, due to high pathogenicity, the need for hospitalization and high mortality, especially among the elderly, it is one of the most dangerous foodborne diseases [

 <xref rid="B2-foods-09-01740" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In the years 2009–2018, an increase in listeriosis in the EU/EEA was observed [
 <xref rid="B3-foods-09-01740" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. High-risk foods due to the presence of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> include ready-to-eat (RTE) products, particularly RTE smoked and gravad fish, heat-treated meat and soft and semi-soft cheese. Thus far, fruits and vegetables have been classified as “low risk” products [

 <xref rid="B4-foods-09-01740" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,

 <xref rid="B7-foods-09-01740" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, currently, foodborne outbreak statistics show that there is an increasing trend in fresh-cut produce and associated outbreaks mostly caused by such bacterial agents as 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp. and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> O157:H7 [
 <xref rid="B8-foods-09-01740" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-foods-09-01740" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Fresh vegetables are foods with a short shelf life, so there is a need to optimize moderate processing and storage [
 <xref rid="B10-foods-09-01740" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-foods-09-01740" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Among natural preservatives are plant essential oils, which can be used to disinfect minimally processed vegetables [
 <xref rid="B12-foods-09-01740" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Essential oils from spice plants have long been used in the food industry as flavorings in food and drink. Essential oils also have a number of biological activities, including antimicrobial, antioxidant, cytotoxic, anti-inflammatory and insecticidal [
 <xref rid="B13-foods-09-01740" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Even a small addition of essential oils to minimally processed vegetables can enrich them culinarily. In addition, essential oils with strong antimicrobial activity can improve the microbiological safety of these products [
 <xref rid="B14-foods-09-01740" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It was found that 0.3% and 0.5% cinnamon oil was the most effective against 
 <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serotype Newport on organic leafy greens [
 <xref rid="B15-foods-09-01740" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and marjoram essential oil at 0.5% concentration showed disinfection capacity of multidrug-resistant 
 <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Schwarzengrund in lettuce [
 <xref rid="B14-foods-09-01740" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Additionally, oregano oil effectively reduced levels of total mesophilic microorganisms in fresh leaf lettuce and radish sprouts [
 <xref rid="B16-foods-09-01740" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. 
 <italic>Tetraclinis articulata</italic> essential oils can be used as a potential source of fungicides to protect stored tomatoes from pathogens and saprophytic fungi [
 <xref rid="B17-foods-09-01740" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, the disadvantage of essential oils in food production, limiting their widespread use, is the intense odor and taste, not always favorably affecting the sensory characteristics of products. Therefore, in the production of food, essential oils are often used in high dilutions, which in turn may prove ineffective in microbiological food protection. In order to preserve the benefits of using essential oils (culinary and antimicrobial) in the production of low-processed vegetables, combinations of essential oils in reduced concentrations are used, while it is necessary to select such a combination for a specific food product [
 <xref rid="B18-foods-09-01740" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In the study presented by Lv et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-foods-09-01740" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], it was shown that combined selected Eos, e.g., oregano–basil, basil–bergamot, oregano–bergamot and oregano–perilla, were considered antimicrobial agents with higher efficacy compared to EOs used alone. Furthermore, this study also suggested that combinations of EOs could minimize application concentrations and consequently reduce any adverse sensory impact in food.
