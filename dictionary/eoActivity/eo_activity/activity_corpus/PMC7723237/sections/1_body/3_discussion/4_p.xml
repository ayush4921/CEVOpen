<p>The results of the treatment of minced beef with essential oils of cumin, black seeds, cloves, cinnamon, and marjoram under levels 0.25% and 0.50% during storage showed that statistically significant decrease in 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp. counts in comparison to control samples during storage except for essential oil of marjoram under levels 0.25%, accordingly we recommend the use of marjoram essential oil not less than 1% (volume/weight). Furthermore, there was an increase in 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp. count in the control sample. Moreover, after storage for 6 days 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp. disappeared in minced beef samples contained black seeds essential oils with level 0.50%. After 15 days of the refrigerated storage, there were no any 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp. in all studied samples except the sample contained marjoram oil at 0.25% and 0.50% and the control.
