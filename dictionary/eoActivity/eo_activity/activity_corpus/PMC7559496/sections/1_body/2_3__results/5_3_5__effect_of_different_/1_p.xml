<p>In this part, we studied the effect of different treatments in the golden hamster on the level of the serum inflammatory factor (shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(a)</xref>, data showed that each intervention group clearly lowered the serum IL-1
 <italic>α</italic> content in comparison with MG (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). The HBO even lowered the IL-1
 <italic>α</italic> level to about one-fifth of the MG (83 pg/mL and 433 pg/mL, respectively). The IL-1
 <italic>α</italic> level in HOO was obviously reduced relative to that in HOJ. Meanwhile, bergamot groups showed similar results. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(b)</xref>, the content of IL-6 was clearly decreased in HBO, LBO, and HOO groups in contrast with MG (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Groups with essential oil could significantly decrease IL-6 level compared with the corresponding dose of juice groups (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(c)</xref>, in addition to LOJ, all other intervention groups significantly reduced TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> level (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Treatment with low-dose sweet essential oil could significantly reduce TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> level relative to that with LOJ (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). The TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> level in essential oil groups was lower than that in the corresponding dose of juice groups. Both of bergamot and sweet orange groups had anti-inflammation effect by a quantity-effect relationship.
