<p>Caspase-3 levels were determined to assess the effect of different treatments on apoptosis of sebaceous gland cells. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, we found that each intervention group significantly increased the relative activity of caspase-3 in comparison with the MG (
