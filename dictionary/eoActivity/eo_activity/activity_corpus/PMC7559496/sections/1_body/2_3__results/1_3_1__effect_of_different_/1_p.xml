<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(a)</xref>, all groups exhibited better inhibitory effect than MG on the growth rate of sebaceous gland spots (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). The growth rate of the sebaceous gland spots in bergamot essential oil groups was remarkably decreased compared with the corresponding dose of juice groups. HBO, LBO, and HOO could significantly inhibit the growth rate of the left-side sebaceous gland spots of hamsters compared with the PG group (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). The HBO, LBO, and HBJ groups significantly decreased the growth rate of the right-side sebaceous gland spots in golden hamsters to 2.21%, 1.13%, and 1.09%, respectively (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). The growth rate of the sebaceous gland spots in bergamot essential oil groups was clearly decreased in contrast with the corresponding dose of sweet orange groups (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(b)</xref>, each intervention group clearly reduced the growth rate of the left-side sebaceous gland spots compared with MG (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Only the groups of bergamots, LOO, HOO, and HOJ, could significantly inhibit the growth rate of right-side sebaceous gland spots in comparison with MG (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). The growth rate of sebaceous gland spots in essential oil groups was lower than that in the corresponding dose of juice groups. According to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(c)</xref>, the growth rate of the right-side sebaceous gland of each intervention group was significantly different from that of the MG (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05), while the growth rate of the left-side sebaceous gland of LBO, HBO, HBJ, and sweet orange groups was significantly lower than that of the MG (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). The growth rate of the sebaceous gland spots in sweet orange essential oil groups was obviously decreased in contrast with the corresponding dose of juice groups (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(d)</xref>, compared with the MG, each intervention group significantly reduced the growth rate of the left-side sebaceous gland spots of the golden hamster (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). In contrast, only the groups of LBO, HBO, and HBJ could significantly decrease the growth rate of the right-side sebaceous gland spots in contrast with MG (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Treatment with sweet orange essential oil could significantly decrease the growth rate of the sebaceous gland spots compared with the corresponding dose of juice groups (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Both of bergamot and sweet orange groups exhibited the effect of decreasing the growth rate of sebaceous gland spots with a dose-effect relationship.
