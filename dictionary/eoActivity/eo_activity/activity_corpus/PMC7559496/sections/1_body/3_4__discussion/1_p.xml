<p>Golden hamsters could be used as a model of acne vulgaris caused by the excessive secretion of androgen, which appeared in two sebaceous glands in the lateral abdomen [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Therefore, determining the area and thickness of the sebaceous gland can reflect the severity of acne vulgaris in golden hamsters, to a certain extent. It was reported that 
 <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>-fermented 
 <italic>C. obtuse</italic> significantly decreased sebum secretion and size of the sebaceous gland compared with baseline (0.24 ± 0.09 mm
 <sup>2</sup> vs. 0.38 ± 0.11 mm
 <sup>2</sup>, respectively) [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In our study, the size of the sebaceous gland was not reduced with the treatment with bergamot and sweet orange, and the growth rate of sebaceous gland spots decreased instead. It was reported that activating the expression of apoptotic proteins through a series of reactions could ultimately lead to a reduction in the area or thickness of the sebaceous gland [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Caspase-3 plays an executing role in the process of apoptosis, and it is also the most important downstream protease of the apoptotic effect and execution process [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Inhibition of caspase-3 was reported to attenuate sebaceous gland cell proliferation and organ size [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In this study, the growth rate of sebaceous gland spots and caspase-3 activity in golden hamsters with different doses of intervention substances were analyzed. It was found that after 4 weeks of intervention, the growth rate of sebaceous gland spots in each intervention group was significantly decreased compared with that in MG, and caspase-3 activity was significantly increased in comparison with that in MG (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Moreover, the effect of each intervention substance was positively correlated with the dose, and the bergamot essential oil had the best improvement effect. Therefore, it is suggested that bergamot essential oil, bergamot juice, sweet orange essential oil, and sweet orange juice may alleviate acne vulgaris by promoting the apoptosis of sebaceous gland cells in the golden hamster through enhancing the activity of caspase-3.
