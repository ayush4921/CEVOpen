  <p>Coacervation process adapted from Reference [
   <xref rid="B105-antioxidants-10-00330" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. The bioactive molecule to be encapsulated (core) is first mixed with one polymer before adding the oppositely charged polymer. The complex coacervation process is generally spontaneous or induced by altering the physicochemical parameters (pH, temperature, ionic strength, etc.). This process leads to the formation of micrometric droplets (5–10 µm) with entrapped bioactive molecules. At the end, stabilization can be performed using chemical or physical treatments.
