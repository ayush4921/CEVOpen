<p>Many mechanisms of action are attributed to the interaction of EOs with the components of the cell membrane. The lipophilic character of molecules in EOs make them capable of penetrating the phospholipid double layer of the cell membrane, leading to a lack of regulation of the cell membrane, thereby disrupting the transportation of nutrients. Membrane transport can also dysregulate via disturbance of the ionic gradient on the cytoplasmic membraneâ€™s two sides. However, some bacteria strains have been able to develop mechanisms allowing it to counteract this effect through ion pump use [
