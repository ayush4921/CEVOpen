<p>The effects of EOs, when supplied in the feed on the meat and milk quality of the animal, are contradictory, probably due to the different compositions of the EOs administered in each study. However, there is a consensus that low doses of EOs when feeding between 1.33 and 4 g/animal/day, may improve, in some cases, meat quality and shelf life (lessened color degradation, increased antioxidant activity, and decreased lipid oxidation in the meat). A dose of 3.5 g/animal/day could be recommended in feedlot animals [
