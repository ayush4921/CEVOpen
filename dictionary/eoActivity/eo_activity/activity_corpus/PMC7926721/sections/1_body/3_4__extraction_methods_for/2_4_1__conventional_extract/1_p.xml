<p>In this category of extraction techniques, the heating processâ€™ water distillation is classically used to obtain EOs from aromatic plants by two methods: hydro distillation and steam distillation. As for the first method, plant material is immersed into boiled water inside the alembic and vapors are condensed onto liquid in a decanter separating the EO from water. In contrast, in the steam distillation, plant material is heated by water steam. Another method used to recover EO compounds is solvent extraction by using acetone, petroleum ether, hexane, methanol, or ethanol, but the inconvenience of this method is that it allows extracting other non-volatile compounds at the same time which makes the second step of EO purification essential [
