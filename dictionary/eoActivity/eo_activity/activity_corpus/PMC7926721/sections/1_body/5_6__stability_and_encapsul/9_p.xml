  <italic>The complex coacervation process:</italic>
 </bold> This process involves a liquidâ€“liquid phase separation formed between two or more oppositely charged biopolymers from the initial solution, leading to coacervate formation around the active ingredient [

Encapsulation by complex coacervation can involve various steps for the formation of microcapsules: (i) an aqueous solution is prepared to contain two or more anionic and cationic polymers, (ii) the aqueous phase is mixed with a hydrophobic solution to produce a stable emulsion, (iii) a sudden change in pH and temperature induces the coacervation and the phase separation, and (iv) the polymer matrices harden by using a desolvating agent, high temperature, or a crosslinking agent (
