<p>Concretely, the EO encapsulation approach has succeeded to convince the research society of its efficacy. Firstly, the oxidation phenomenon has been avoided/retarded after EOs’ encapsulation. Bakry et al. highlighted that basil EO’s microencapsulation protected it against oxidation under accelerated storage conditions for 49 days [

In addition, EO encapsulation allows the preservation of their biological efficiencies during their storage, transport, and processing. The encapsulation of oregano EO into microspheres of native sorghum and rice starch significantly prolonged its antioxidant activity during storage [
