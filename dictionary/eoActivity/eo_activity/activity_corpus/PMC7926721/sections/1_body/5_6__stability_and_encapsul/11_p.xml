  <italic>Liposomes:</italic>
 </bold> Liposomes are made with many phospholipids bilayers vesicles enclosing an internal aqueous volume [
 <xref rid="B107-antioxidants-10-00330" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. The growing interest in liposomes can be attributed mainly to their property of mimicking biological cells. Accordingly, liposomes are highly biocompatible, making them an ideal candidate for a drug delivery system, with applications ranging from delivering enzymes, antibacterial drugs, fungicides, and adjuvants for vaccines [
