<p>Besides, it was confirmed that the incorporation of EOs in foods can be prejudice given their hydrophobicity and volatility [
 <xref rid="B89-antioxidants-10-00330" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Thus, EOs lose small quantities of volatile compounds when stored at high temperatures. Some components are highly unstable at pH variations, like citral, easily decomposed in an acidic environment [
 <xref rid="B93-antioxidants-10-00330" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Moreover, the hydrophobicity of EOs leads to their heterogeneous distribution in an aqueous medium. Such characteristics would lead to decreased EOs efficiencies as antimicrobial and antioxidant agents and limit their use as green and natural preservatives.
