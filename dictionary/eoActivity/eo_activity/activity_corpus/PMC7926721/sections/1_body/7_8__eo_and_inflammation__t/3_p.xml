<p>In monogastric species like pigs, the integration of diet with EO can change the distribution of lymphocytes in the gut. It is unknown whether this effect is direct, e.g., related to EOs’ interaction with the intestinal immune system, or indirect, via EOs’ interaction with the resident microbiome, which changes its relationship with the resident immune system. By integrating diets with a mixture of carvacrol, cinnamaldehyde, and capsicum oleoresin, it was possible to decrease intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) population jejunum and ileum and increase lymphocyte in the lamina propria of early-weaned pigs [

Indeed, this information does not allow to understand the consequence of this immunomodulatory activity for the overall animal health. On one side, a decrease of the immune activation may protect the animal from the unwanted excess of immune stimulation, and prevent collateral damages related to inflammation. On the other hand, decreasing immune activity might also pave the way for a breakthrough of pathogens.
