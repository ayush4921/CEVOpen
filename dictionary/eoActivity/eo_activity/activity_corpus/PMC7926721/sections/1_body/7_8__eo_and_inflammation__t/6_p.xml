<p>The molecular basis of the immunomodulatory activity of EOs has not been investigated in-depth and may indeed change, depending on the specific EO used. Regarding oregano-derived EO, the immunomodulatory activity is related to downregulation of pro-inflammatory pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), protein kinase B (Akt), and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling pathways, which reflects on the decreased expression of inflammatory cytokines in the jejunum of pigs models [
