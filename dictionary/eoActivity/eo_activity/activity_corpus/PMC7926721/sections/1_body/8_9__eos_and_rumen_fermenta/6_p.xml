<p>EOs may also affect the degradation and metabolism of feed proteins in the rumen by reducing the reactions of deamination of amino acids, thus decreasing ammonia production. In this sense, EOs could selectively prevent the proliferation of hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria, responsible for these reactions [
