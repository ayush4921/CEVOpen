<p>Furthermore, EO can also affect some ruminal microorganisms involved in the bio-hydrogenation pathways, thus causing a modification of fatty acid profile/Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in ruminal digesta when EOs are fed to ruminants. Rosemary and thyme by-products seem to have a potential to increase the unsaturated FA content (particularly n-3 FA) in animal products due to their content in polyphenol compounds, which may inhibit targeted ruminal bacteria involved in biohydrogenation [

It must be considered, however, that different compounds and proportions are found in other EOs, blends, so to better describe the effects caused by these products at a ruminal level, it is desirable to carry out studies with pure compounds (e.g., carvacrol, thymol, eugenol) added at different levels, to better understand the modifications produced on ruminal microbiota and bio-hydrogenation pathways.
