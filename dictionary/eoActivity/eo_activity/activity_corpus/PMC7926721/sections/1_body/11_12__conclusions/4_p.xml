<p>Using EOs to promote animal health and welfare from a One Health perspective is very important (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-10-00330-f006">Figure 6</xref>). Studies in controlled conditions mostly agree that EOs affect the immune system by activating the arachidonic metabolism or cytokine production and/or the modulation of pro-inflammatory gene expression by regulating the NF-κB inflammatory pathway and MAPK signaling pathway [

 <xref rid="B137-antioxidants-10-00330" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. Nevertheless, the effects were mostly demonstrated under in vitro conditions. More well-designed in vitro and in vivo studies, involving a normalization of dose, taking into account environmental factors such as the type of the diet, breed, and age, will allow a better understanding of EOs’ biological activities under several environmental conditions. In addition, the activities’ molecular bases have not been primarily investigated in depth in this field and may change depending on the specific EO used and the type and severity of the disease. Thus, considering the multitude of components of EOs and the spectrum of possible activities, there is still a vast amount unknown about their actual effects on animal health and particularly in ruminants.
