 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-10-00330-f002">Figure 2</xref> shows an “Epic epoch” graph allowing to visualize the first 5 most used keywords in each article for each year and their evolutions. The map presents the different fields where EOs were used. We notice the growing evolution of the terms “chicken” and “storage” and the decreasing evolution of the word “diet”.
