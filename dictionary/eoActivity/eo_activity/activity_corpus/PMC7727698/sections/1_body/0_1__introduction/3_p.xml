<p>Citrus oils have attracted the attention of researchers in recent years because they can be obtained as active ingredients from juice industry byproducts. Orange or bergamot oils are extracted using hydrodistilatilon from the peels after juice extraction, being a secondary raw material that can be used efficiently in the context of the circular economy. The antimicrobial activity of the orange essential oil (OEO) was evaluated and it exhibited significant inhibitory effects against many bacteria [
