<p>The antibacterial efficiency of plant compounds depends on several factors such as characteristics of microorganism analyzed, characteristics of the plant taken into research and the chemical properties of the solution obtained and tested. Plant-derived compounds (biologically active substances, generally secondary metabolites, given the fact that they occur as an intermediate or end products of secondary plant metabolism) could exhibit a direct antibacterial activity and/or an indirect activity. Because essential oils represent complex mixtures of compounds, belonging to different chemical classes that share some general mutual characteristics, such as polarity and/or volatility, synergistic or antagonistic interactions between two or more main components, in which one enhances the effect of the other and together they act more efficiently than as individual agents, are more than frequent, becoming the main motivation behind many researchers.
