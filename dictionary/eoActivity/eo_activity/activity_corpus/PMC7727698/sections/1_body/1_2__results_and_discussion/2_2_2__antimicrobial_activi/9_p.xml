<p>It should be noted that even if in the one-component variant EOEO and EBEO do not register any inhibitory effect, by associating with the ECEO, the chemical components, especially D-limonene present in both OEO and BEO and eugenol in CEO, exert synergistic effects and increase the inhibition effect of ECEO. The E(BEO/CEO) emulsion (100 µL) has a diameter of the inhibition zone of 27.5 mm, respectively 22.5 mm in the E(OEO/CEO), over the diameter of the positive control, gentamicin (19 mm) and ECEO (17.5 mm). The tertiary emulsion E(OEO/BEO/CEO), has antibacterial activity comparable to that exerted by the one-component ECEO emulsion (17.5 mm, respectively 14 mm for doses of 100 µL and 150 µL emulsion). The obtained results confirms previous data regarding the strong inhibitory effect against S. flexneri of ECEO (about 23 mm for diameter of inhibition zone) [
