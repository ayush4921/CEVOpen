<p>The application of one-component emulsions on 
 <italic>S. flexneri</italic>, shows a response similar with the one obtained against 
 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05502-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). The ECEO is found to have an inhibitory effect (17.5 mm for 100 ÂµL applied emulsion), but lower compared to the positive control gentamicin 10 mg (19 mm), while EOEO and EBEO have no effect on 
 <italic>S. flexneri</italic>, regardless of the concentration applied.
