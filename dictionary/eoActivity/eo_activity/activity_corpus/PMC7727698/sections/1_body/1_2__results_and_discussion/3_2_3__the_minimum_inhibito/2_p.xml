<p>The MICs of eugenol, the main compound of CEO, was found to be 2 µL/100 mL, but the inhibition effect decreased with concentration for all tested strains. Given the composition of CEO (80.11% eugenol), it was expected, as proved by experimental values, that the MIC for CEO is close to the eugenol value (2 µL/100 mL), except for the values obtained for 
 <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, where the MIC is greater than 7 µL/100 mL. The results concerning the MIC for each of the standards tested correlate with the literature data. Pinto et al., 2009 reported an average of 6.6 µg/100 mL for volatile terpene compounds (thymol, 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, γ-terpinene), and MIC = 120 µL/mL for eugenol, respectively, against 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and 0.5 µL/mL against 
 <italic>Salmonella Typhimurium</italic> [

 <xref rid="B3-molecules-25-05502" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Eugenol has proven antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp. (
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>) and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Haemophilus</italic> strains [
