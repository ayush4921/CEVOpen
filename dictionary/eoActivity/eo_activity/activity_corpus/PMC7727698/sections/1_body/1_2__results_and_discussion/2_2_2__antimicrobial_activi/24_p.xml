<p>In the case of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05502-f001">Figure 1</xref>G), when applying the one-component emulsions, the maximum inhibition effect is noticed for EBEO (diameter of the inhibition zone between 15–17.5 mm, depending on the amount applied), this being higher than the effect exerted in the case of gentamicin treatment. Inhibition of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> development, although smaller compared to the positive control, is observed for ECEO emulsion (diameter of the inhibition zone between 7–8 mm, depending on the amount applied), the value differences being statistically significant. EOEO does not exert antibacterial effect against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, regardless of the amount applied. The use of binary emulsions of E(BEO/CEO) leads to the increase of inhibition potential against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, the registered value being statistically significant both compared to the positive control and to the one-component emulsions. The inhibition zone of E(OEO/CEO) mixture, was not statistically significantly different from those recorded for gentamicin, while the E(OEO/BEO) emulsion leads to a lower effect than the control (statistically significant differences) and comparable to the effect produced by the one-component ECEO.
