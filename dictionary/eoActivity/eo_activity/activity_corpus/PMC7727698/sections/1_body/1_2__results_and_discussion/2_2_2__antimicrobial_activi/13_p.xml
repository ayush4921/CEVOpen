<p>The profile of antibacterial activity on 
 <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> when one-component, binary or tertiary emulsions based on EOEO, EBEO and ECEO were applied is similar to the effect exerted by the mentioned emulsions on 
 <italic>S. flexneri</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05502-f001">Figure 1</xref>C). An important inhibition rate is observed when the one-component emulsion based on ECEO (21, respectively 19 mm inhibition area compared to 16 mm for the positive control) was used, while EOEO and EBEO have no effect regardless of the applied concentration. The use of E(BEO/CEO) binary mixtures respectively E(OEO/CEO) potentiates the antibacterial effects due the synergism created by the main chemical components (eugenol in CEO and D-limonene in OEO and BEO). Binary mixtures exert an antibacterial effect on 
 <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> higher than ECEO monocomponent emulsion and over the gentamicin (inhibition zone 21–29.5 mm for E(BEO/CEO), respectively 29.5–20 mm for E(OEO/CEO), depending on the amount of emulsion applied. The tertiary mixture E(OEO/CEO/BEO) exerts an important inhibitory effect of the 
 <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> mycelium (22 mm and 18 mm, respectively), higher than positive control (16 mm), but smaller than binary mixtures. Values comparable to the positive control (gentamicin), from a statistical point of view, are recorded for ECEO, E(BEO/CEO) and E(OEO/CEO) (150 µL), respectively for the tertiary mixture E(OEO/BEO/CEO), regardless of concentration.
