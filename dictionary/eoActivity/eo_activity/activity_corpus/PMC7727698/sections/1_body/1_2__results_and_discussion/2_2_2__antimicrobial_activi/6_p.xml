<p>Statistically significant differences, compared to the positive control, were registered for the monocomponent variants of EOEO and EBEO type, regardless of concentration, respectively for the binary mixtures of E(OEO/BEO) type. For CEOs in the one-component or two-component version, E(BEO/CEO) 150 µL, E(OEO/CEO) 100 µL, respectively three-component E(BEO/CEO/OEO), 100 µL, there were no statistically significant differences compared to control consisting of gentamicin.</p>
