<p>The antimicrobial profile of the emulsions against 
 <italic>H. influenzae</italic> has the same characteristics as the one obtained for 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>. EOEO and EBEO monocomponent emulsions have no activity, only the ECEO has an antibacterial effect. In bicomponent emulsions, the addition of OEO and CEO leads to increased antimicrobial activity, the same effect being observed in the case of tertiary emulsion E(OEO/CEO/BEO) (
