<p>It is observed that ECEO is responsible for the antibacterial activity, but the inhibitory capacity of the one-component emulsion is lower in this case compared to the effect exerted on the other analyzed gram positive or negative bacteria. The diameter of the inhibition zone is smaller than the positive control in the case of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (12 mm for the application of 100 µL emulsion, respectively 13 mm for 150 µL, compared to gentamicin 15.5 mm). The diameter of the inhibition zone does not differ statistically significantly from the positive control (16.5/18 mm compared to 17.5 mm in the case of gentamicin). Statistically significant differences compared with the positive control (gentamicin) are noted for one-component emulsions EOEO and EBEO (without effect), respectively binary emulsions E(BEO/CEO) (100 µL) and E(OEO/CEO) (100 µL) (a potentiated effect compared to the control), both in the case of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli.</italic>
