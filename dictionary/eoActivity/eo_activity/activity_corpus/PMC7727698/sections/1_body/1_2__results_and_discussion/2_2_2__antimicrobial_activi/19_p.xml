<p>The association of binary components E(OEO/CEO), E(BEO/CEO) leads to the potentiation of the inhibition effect, which increases significantly compared to the positive control, especially when applying 100 µL emulsion (21/22 mm for 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 26, 5/29 mm for 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>). This confirms the synergistic effect exerted by associating the active principles of CEO (eugenol) with the main terpene components of OEO and BEO (D-limonene, α-pinene). The same effect was reported by Cho et al., where an antibacterial effect of clove oil against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> was observed for 600 µg/mL. Other studies reported the inhibitory effect of eugenol, the main chemical compound of clove oil [
