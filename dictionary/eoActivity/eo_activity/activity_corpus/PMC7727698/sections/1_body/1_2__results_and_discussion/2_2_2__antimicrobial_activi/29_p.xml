<p>The findings of the study conducted by Pinto et al., indicated that CEO has potential as a therapeutic option against fungi that are pathogenic to humans including 
 <italic>C. albicans, C. tropicalis</italic> and 
 <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-05502" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In the presence of binary emulsion E(BEO/OEO), the different behaviour of 
 <italic>C.albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>C. parapsilopsis</italic> is observed. If in the case of the first fungal strain an antifungal effect is observed as a result of the synergism created by the constituent compounds, in the case of 
 <italic>C. parapsilopsis</italic> this is not highlighted (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05502-f001">Figure 1</xref>H,I). The different mechanism of action can be explained by: (i) different modification of active sites on fungal cell, (ii) different capacity to inhibit the enzymes, (iii) increase/decrease of membrane permeability [
 <xref rid="B60-molecules-25-05502" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. In the case of the two fungi studied, we notice the maximum inhibition potential exhibited by the tertiary emulsion E(CEO/BEO/OEO), when applying 100 ÂµL.
