 <sc>d</sc>-Limonene represents 97.93% of the OEO composition and 49.38% of BEO. The MICs for limonene were found to be 2 µL/100 mL, excepting 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> for which the MIC value was 7 µL/100 mL. The development of the fungus is different depending on the concentration and tested strains. Thus, for 
 <italic>S. aureus, Haemofilus influenzae</italic> and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, the inhibitory effect decreases with increasing tested concentration above the MIC, the value of 2 µL/100 mL being optimal, while for the other strains the antimicrobial effect increases with increasing tested concentration over the MIC. A similar profile to that of limonene is registered when OEO and BEO were tested, with some modifications caused by the presence of other minor components that act differently depending on the strain studied. Thus, if limonene has antimicrobial effect on 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (MIC 2 µL/100 mL), OEO does not inhibit the micellium growth, even at 7 µL/100 mL. The same trend was recorded for limonene and BEO against 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes.</italic>
