<p>As our results in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05502-f001">Figure 1</xref>E,F present, the Gram-negative strains (
 <italic>P. aeroginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>) were more sensitive to the synergistic effect of the tested emulsions than Gram-positive strains. There are several possible causes, the most often cited one being the particularities of the cell wall and cell membrane [
 <xref rid="B62-molecules-25-05502" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Hemaiswarya et al., noticed synergistic interactions of eugenol from 
 <italic>Eugenia</italic> plant aromatics with 10 different hydrophobic and hydrophilic antibiotics in case of five Gram-negative bacteria. Synergism occurred due to ability of eugenol to increase the permeability of cell membrane, by reducing the density of the lipids and resulting in a permeable membrane [
 <xref rid="B62-molecules-25-05502" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. We considers that most likely the same think occurred with our emulsions, one component acting perhaps as an agent that modified the permeability of the cell membrane, while another one acted as an antimicrobial agent, once it got inside the pathogenic cell.
