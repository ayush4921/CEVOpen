<p>Applying the E(BEO/CEO) emulsion, an inhibition rate of over 100% is registered for most of the analyzed microbial species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05502-f002">Figure 2</xref>D). The synergistic effects exerted in the binary variants determine the activation of the antibacterial properties of the active principles existing in latent state in the monocomponent variants. Thus, if for the monocomponent variants ECEO and EBEO no inhibitory effect was registered, in the case of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa and H. influenzae</italic>, it is observed that applying the binary mixture E(BEO/CEO), the inhibition rate is 100% and 135.48%, depending on the amount applied, compared to gentamicin (100% inhibition rate) for 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, respectively 152% and 172% for 
 <italic>H. influenzae</italic>.
