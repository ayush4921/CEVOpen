<p>Mean particle size (nm) of natural preparations range between 180.6–624.3 nm falling into the category of emulsion and nanoemulsions. According to Gupta et al., nanoemulsions are characterized by particle sizes between 20–500 nm, thermodynamically instability and kinetic stability and polydispersity (&lt;10–20%) [

The physical stability of emulsion systems is characterized by the mean particle size that describes the average size of the dispersed oil droplets and PDI that measures the size distribution and stability of droplet sizes in the emulsion [

Nanoemulsions are colloidal dispersions consisting of two immiscible solvents—oil (globules) and water (liquid)—in which one is dispersed in the other with the help of a surfactant that stabilizes the emulsion. Nanoemulsions are promising nanocarriers widely used in drug delivery, which help in improving the biodistribution of drugs and minimizing toxicity [

Uni-populational emulsions were obtained in the case of the samples EBEO (277.3 nm), EOEO (320.2 nm) and E(BEO/OEO) (315.5 nm), while the other samples present two particle populations with different ratios. According to Borcan et al., a polydisperse system based on polyurethane structures displays improved release kinetic due to the heterogeneity of that sample and it can assure an almost constant concentration of the active agent in the case of a prolonged release [
