<p>One-component emulsions have been shown to be less effective in terms of antimicrobial effect compared to standards and constituent oils, having MIC &gt; 140 µL/100 mL. The same behavior is registered in the case of binary emulsions E(OEO/BEO), while the association of E(OEO/CEO) and E(BEO/CEO) (MIC = 40 µL/100 mL, excepting 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> MIC &gt; 140 µL/100 mL) leads to synergistic effects that enchaced the antimicrobial activity against tested strains. The tertiary emulsion E(BEO/CEO/OEO) has a MIC of 40 µL/100 mL for majority strains, excepting 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>, 
 <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (MIC &gt; 140 µL/100 mL).
