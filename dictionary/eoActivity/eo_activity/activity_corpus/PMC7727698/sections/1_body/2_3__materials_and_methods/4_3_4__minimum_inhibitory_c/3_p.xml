<p>A fresh culture dilution at 10
 <sup>−3</sup> was used to perform the analysis, with an inoculum equivalent to 1.5 × 108 CFU/mL (0.5 McFarland standard). The resulting dillutions were tested using a 96 SPL Cell Culture Plate (Cat.no. 31096, SPL Life Sciences Co., St. Petersburg, FL, USA) with a working volume of 200 μL. Using a Socorex Calibra digital 852 multichannel pipette (No. SOCO_13018, Socorex Isba SA, Ecublens, Switzerland), 100 μL of strain diluted suspension was placed in each well. The analyzed sample was applied directly inside each well, introducing 2, 5 and 7 µL/100 mL in case of EOs and standards and 40, 100 and 140 µL/100 mL, respectively, in case of the emulsions.
