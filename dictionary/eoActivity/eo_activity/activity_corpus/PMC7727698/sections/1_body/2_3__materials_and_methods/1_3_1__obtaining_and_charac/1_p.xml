<p>The natural emulsions were obtained based on EOs from CEO, BEO and OEO (SC SOLARIS PLANT SRL, Bucharest, Romania) using the method described in our previous paper [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-05502" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The emulsifier (lecithin) was dissolved in water and the EO was mixed using a VCX130 PB Ultrasonic Processor (130 Watt, Frequency 20 kHz, Sonics &amp; Materials Inc., Newtown, CT, USA), for 10 min at an amplitude of 98%. The monocomponent emulsions (EOEO, EBEO, ECEO) were obtained by adding 1 mL of EOs in 19 mL water and 6 mg of lecithin (WalMart, Rogers, AR, USA) as emulsifier. Binary emulsions E(OEO/BEO), E(OEO/CEO), E(BEO/CEO) were obtained by adding one mL of each EOs, 6 mg lecithin and 18 mL water. The tertiary emulsion E(OEO/BEO/CEO) was prepared by adding 1 mL of each EOs, 6 mg lecithin and 17 mL water.
