<p>The antimycotic and antibacterial effect of the natural preparations was achieved by measuring the diameter of the analysed culture inhibition zones (including the diameter of the disc—5 mm) in millimeters. Also, the inhibition ratio reported to the positive control (gentamicin/nystatin) and negative control (papers not impregnated) was calculated according the formula [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-25-05502" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]:
 <disp-formula>% inhibition = 100 × [1 − (D
  <sub>sample</sub> − D
  <sub>positive</sub>)/(D
  <sub>negative</sub> − D
  <sub>positive</sub>)]
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula> where D negative—diameter of paper not impregnated (mm); D positive—diameter of entamicin/nystatin inhibition zone (mm) and D sample—diameter of inhibition zone of sample with inhibitor agent (mm).
