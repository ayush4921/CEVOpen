<p>In this way, the antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> rhizome essential oil stood out over 10 other different essential oils. Its free radical-scavenging potential was twice higher than that of Trolox (~60% vs. 28.2%, respectively), and the antioxidant activity (72.4%) was near the values of the reference essential oil 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> (90.9%) and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) (86.74%) [

 <italic>C. longa</italic> rhizome oil was also highlighted over 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> spp., such as 
 <italic>E. sideroxylon</italic>, 
 <italic>E. tereticornis</italic> and 
 <italic>E. citriodora</italic> [130.5 ± 1.2, 122.1 ± 1.4 and 95.8 ± 1.0 µM ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) equivalents, respectively], with 138.4 ± 1.1 µM FRAP equivalents. This value was even higher than the one of other 
 <italic>Curcuma</italic> spp.—for instance, 
 <italic>C. aromatica</italic> (130.6 ± 1.5 µM FRAP equivalents) [

 <italic>C. longa</italic> oil suppressed the oxidase enzyme activity of fresh-cut “Fuji” apples by 9% [
