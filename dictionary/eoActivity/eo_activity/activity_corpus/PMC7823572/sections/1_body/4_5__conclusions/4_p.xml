<p>Given the nature of these products (complex mixtures of volatile compounds), one of the first processes to take into account is the extraction technique chosen. Despite that the conventional methods (steam distillation, hydrodistillation, etc.) are still the most commonly used, there is a current tendency to employ the novel ones (SFE, SWE, SFME, MAE, etc.) that offer several advantages, such as the reduction of costs, of extraction times, energy consumption, etc., in an attempt to offer higher-quality 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> rhizome essential oil in the lowest time possible and with the minimum residues produced. For its total implementation, further research is needed to achieve the most efficient extraction that allows obtaining a chemical composition enriched in the active component to elucidate its mechanisms of action, encapsulating techniques of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> essential oil for its preservation and/or release against external conditions (temperature, oxygen, etc.), as well as to determine the threshold application with which it would neither damage crops nor affect the organoleptic properties of food products, are necessary research prior to their employment in the agri-food industry.
