<p>On the other hand, several studies corroborate that the qualitative and quantitative chemical compositions of turmeric rhizomes essential oil may fluctuate according to many factors [

 <xref rid="B149-plants-10-00044" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>]. Sometimes, different chemical compositions come from the intrinsic characteristics of each genotype. In fact, certain traits of a specific variety of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> can influence the content of rhizome oil, representing good criteria for the selection of high-yield ones. Regarding this, an interesting study observed a direct relationship between plant height and rhizome oil content, as well as a negative correlation between the amount of essential oil in the dry leaf with the one contained in the fresh rhizome [
 <xref rid="B150-plants-10-00044" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>]. A clear example of genotype influence is the dissimilar chemical composition between yellow 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> rhizome oil rich in oxygenated sesquiterpenes (ar-turmerone, turmerone, curlone, etc.) and red one with oxygenated monoterpenes (carvacrol, citral, methyl eugenol, geraniol, etc.) as principal compounds more similar to 
 <italic>Origanum</italic> or 
 <italic>Thymus</italic> spp. [

 <italic>C. longa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B152-plants-10-00044" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]. The influence of the genotype or cultivars have also been reported by other authors who observed significant variations in the yield and chemical composition of rhizome oils of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> under similar climatic conditions [
