<p id="p0170">Chemat, Grondin, Shum Cheong Sing and Smadja [
 <xref rid="b0515" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>] studied the effect of various US frequencies (20 and 47 kHz) treatment during the processing of sunflower oil. The authors found significant negative changes in the oil composition (degradation of linoleic acid and sterols and increasing of aldehydic volatiles like hexanal and hept-2-enal), due to free-radicals oxidation during the treatment. On the other hand, the oil of red pepper (
 <italic>Capsicum annuum</italic>) seed was not affected by the US treatment (20 kHz, 30–90 °C for 70 min) [
 <xref rid="b0430" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. The authors did not find changes in acid and saponification values after using US which indicates that US did not affect the oil molecular weight. However, the peroxide value was slightly increased due to slight oxidation of the oil [
 <xref rid="b0430" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Also, relatively high amounts of phytosterols (stigmasterol, sitosterol, and sitostanol) were observed after US treatment that was paralleled by a decrease in campesterol stability (38% loss) [

 <xref rid="b0375" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] showed that US (25 kHz, 550 W, 70 °C for 38 min) treatment for oil extraction from tea (
 <italic>Camelia sinensis</italic>) increased total phytosterols, β-sitosterol, stigmasterol, campesterol and other phytosterols by 20, 25, 16, 37 and 26%, respectively. Furthermore, Panadare, Gondaliya and Rathod [
 <xref rid="b0520" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>] found that US pre-treatment (150 s at 30 W) increased oil yield by 11% from 
 <italic>Annona squamosal</italic> seeds compared to conventional methods. The oil characteristics from US and conventional methods were not different in their acid value or free fatty acids. The Oleic / Linoleic ratio was 2.21 which is similar to the range reported in the literature [
