<p id="p0195">Intense US treatment and long contact times are required to inactivate microorganisms. For instance, to inhibit 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, a US treatment of 187 min and 150 W, 20 kHz is required [

 <xref rid="b0550" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>] studied the US (20, 60 kHz; 200, 300 W; 2 min) assisted extraction effects of 
 <italic>Tagetes erecta</italic> herb on their antimicrobial activity. They subjected two different bacterial strains to these extracts (Streptococcus mutans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). They observed that the extracts by US showed significantly higher inhibition of the two bacteria compared to the hot water extract. Also, they used field emission scanning electron microscope imaging to indicate why the antibacterial increase was happened by US. In which they observed high membrane damage, as observed with Streptococcus mutans (
 <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). The bacterial cell sensitivity may be due to the changes in cell surface peptidoglucans adherent. In general, most micro-organisms showed greater sensitivity to US at temperature over 50 °C [
