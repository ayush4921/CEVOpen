<p id="p0125">Optimum US extraction conditions for total flavonoids from sour jujube seeds (
 <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>) were obtained at 404 W and 60 °C for 60.03 min. The use of US increased the flavonoids' yield by 17.11% compared to heat reflux extraction. Moreover, the US extracted flavonoids showed higher antioxidant capacity against DPPH, superoxide, and hydroxyl radicals from the significant differences in their chemical construction due to using US-assisted extraction (UAE) or heat reflux extraction (HRE) (
