<p id="p0100">The effects of US depend on the changes in the chemical structure of the material being treated. Heterogeneous reactions that involve unfragmentable substrates inside the US bubbles have been shown to occur by the mechanical effects of the US and lead to increasing chemical reactivity [
 <xref rid="b0340" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], a relationship that is known as mechanochemistry. Huo, Zhao, Shi, Zou, Yang, Warszawik, Loznik, Gostl and Herrmann [
 <xref rid="b0345" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] reported that US mechanochemistry can be exploited to control transformations at the molecular level by rearranging or cleaving bonds at predetermined breaking sites. A recent study investigated the impact of US on camptothecin (CPT) (plant alkaloid monoterpene produced by 
 <italic>Camptotheca acuminata</italic> herb) and the authors found that US transformed the disulfide bonds to thiol bonds of the molecules. As a result, US modified the molecules from covalently attached linear polymer chains in the Î²-position to a disulfide moiety (
