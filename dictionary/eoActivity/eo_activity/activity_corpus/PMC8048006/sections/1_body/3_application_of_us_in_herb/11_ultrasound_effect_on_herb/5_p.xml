<p id="p0190">Joshi and Gogate [
 <xref rid="b0250" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] reported that US horn (20 kHz, 100 W, and 60 °C) enhanced tea acid hydrolysis for the production of reducing sugars. In which, it reduced the reaction time from 120 to 60 min with a high yield of reducing sugars (24.75 g/L). Also, they reported that US combined with oxidants such as H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> effectively decreased the acid hydrolysis time of the tea polysaccharides through facilitating the breakage of lignin, which increased the rate of reducing sugars production from tea powder [
