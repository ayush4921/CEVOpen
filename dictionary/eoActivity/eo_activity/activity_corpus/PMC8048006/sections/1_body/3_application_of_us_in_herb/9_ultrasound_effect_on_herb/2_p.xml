<p id="p0150">Ultrasound treatment affects the protein structure in herbs due to its modifying effect on some secondary bonds of β-sheets and β-turns, which affects the protein's hydrophilic groups and the hydrophobic core [
 <xref rid="b0445" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. A study on arrowhead (
 <italic>Sagittaria sagittifolia</italic>) herbal protein showed that US treatment (28–40 kHz, 30–50 °C) caused unfolding of the protein structure, decreased α-helix and β-turn contents, and increased β-sheet and random coil contents. In which, the content of free sulfhydryl (SH) increased by 38.87% at 40 kHz and 40 °C over the control samples [

 <xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The overstretching of folded macromolecule disrupts the non-covalent interactions responsible for its three-dimensional configuration and affects its ability to be involved in interactions, e,g, change in the active sites of enzymes [
 <xref rid="b0360" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. For instance, Ayim, Ma, Alenyorege, Ali and Donkor [
 <xref rid="b0450" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>] investigated the effect of US (20 kHz, 20–50 °C, 13 min) pretreatment on the enzymolysis of tea residue protein extracted with sodium hydroxide. The authors stated that Michaelis constant (substrate concentration required to half saturate the enzyme) in US pretreated enzymolysis was decreased by 32.7% over the traditional enzymolysis, which just uses sodium hydroxide. An increase in the protein susceptibility to the proteolysis enzymes like pepsin and trypsin was also suggested [
 <xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Hadidi, Khaksar, Pagan and Ibarz [
 <xref rid="b0455" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>] reported that US enhanced alfalfa leaves (
 <italic>Medicago sativa</italic>) protein extraction based on the pH, temperature, and duration. A high-intensity US (20 kHz, 100 W, 30–50 °C for 120 min) changed alfalfa leaves protein physicochemical properties and caused an increase in the protein surface hydrophobicity through disruption of proteins' hydrogen bonds, which affects the proteins surface charge. That US treatment increased the proteins’ solubility due to forming hydrophilic soluble fractions. Also, US (20 kHz, 60 °C for 78.1 min) promoted the interaction between polycysteine and xylose sugar. This eventually increased the antioxidant properties and decreased the formation of sulfur-containing volatiles from the Maillard reaction that is commonly encountered in conventional extractions [
