<p id="p0145">It has been shown that thermosonication can significantly increase the percentage of some extracted terpenes from herbal sources 
 <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. For example, a significant increase in β-ocimene, and D-limonene contents of tea (
 <italic>Camellia Sinensis</italic>) were reported as a result of using 50 °C of US (1.7 MHz, 20 min) compared to 20 °C. On the other hand, alcoholic terpenes such as α-terpineol were not affected by US treatments 
 <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. As mentioned earlier, CPT extraction from the 
 <italic>Camptotheca acuminata</italic> herb by US transformed the disulfide bonds to thiol bonds of these molecules, which resulted in the disulfide motif to be in the center of the macromolecular framework (e.g. Hydrocarbon) and enabled efficient mechanochemical scission and the release of this monoterpene molecule [

 <xref rid="b0295" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>]. Similarly, it has been found that US increased the efficiency of terpenes extraction from oregano herb, especially carvacrol (a monoterpene), ursolic acid (a triterpenoid), and oleanolic (a triterpenoid saponin) compared to the maceration conventional method [
