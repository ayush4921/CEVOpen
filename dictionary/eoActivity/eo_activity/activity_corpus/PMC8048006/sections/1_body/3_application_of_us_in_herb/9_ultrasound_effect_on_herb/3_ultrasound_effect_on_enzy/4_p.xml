<p id="p0165">Manosonication can be defined as a combination of US and high pressure, which can make additional effects with US. This method can significantly change the protein and carbohydrates' conformations and configuration at pressure (100–300 kPa) and low temperatures. Thermal processing with 20 kHz of US is reported to be effective against many enzymes, like dehydrogenase and catalase. Manothermosonication is a combination of US and both heat and pressure that lead to synergistic effects on the extraction of compounds, inactivation of enzymes, and microorganisms. Almost complete enzyme inactivation of heat tolerated enzymes can be at 70 °C, 300 kPa for 2 min [

The inclusion of pressure enhances the action of US and heat in cleaving prosthetic groups of enzymes or denaturize protein subunits. For example, the splitting of the prosthetic heme group of peroxidase, which is the mechanism of heat inactivation, is reported for manothermosonication [
