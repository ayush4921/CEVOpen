<p id="p0130">The effects of ultrasound on plant essential oils have been recently studied [
 <xref rid="b0425" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Essential oils are unstable to heat, thus, the use of US at low intensities could prevent the degradation of these thermally sensitive compounds. Furthermore, excellent diffusion rates were afforded by the use of US, which can facilitate successful extraction with minimum solvent use and subsequently lower solvent residues in the extracted compounds. The composition of the extracted essential oil could be modified and more selective extraction of desired compounds could be obtained [
 <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. For example, by using 20 kHz and 90 °C for 70 min of US, red pepper seeds' alcohol and aldehyde contents were decreased, while other volatile components, such as pyrazine derivatives, esters, and olefin components were increased [
