<p id="p0180">US (45 kHz) at different power levels (40–100 W) were used extraction of polysaccharides from 
 <italic>Acantho panaxsenticosus</italic> herb and their antioxidant activity have been reported by Zhao, Xu, Ye and Dong [
 <xref rid="b0530" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. An extraction time of 75 min at 80 °C, and 100 W US power resulted in the greatest yield (10.9 mg/g). The obtained polysaccharide by US treatment possessed considerable antioxidant activity against DPPH, hydroxyl, and superoxide free radicals [

 <italic>Morus Alba</italic>) leaves proved higher yields and lower water/raw material ratio compared to micro-wave-assisted extraction method [
