<p id="p0120">While the formation of free-radicals during US processing is considered a main disadvantage of the technology as it affects the bioactivity of components such as phenols [
 <xref rid="b0405" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>], chemical modification such as increasing the extent of hydroxylation of flavonoids [
 <xref rid="b0410" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>] can enhance the antioxidant activity or at least counteract some of the negative effects of free radicals. This led to the fact that optimum US processing conditions where maximum yield and bioactivity could be optimized for various materials. In which, US inhibits the hydrolyzing enzymes (such as α-amylase and α-glucosidase) which affects the total flavonoids yields and their antioxidant functionality [
 <xref rid="b0325" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. For instance, the extraction efficiency of dihydromyricetin yield, which is the main flavonoid in Chinese vine herbal tea (Ampelopsis grossedentata), was increased up to 40% (3% yield) with the increase in US power and time until a certain extent (5.5 min at 240 W), after which, the yield was decreased due to hydrolysis of the compound [
 <xref rid="b0415" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Similarly, total flavonoids extracted from 
 <italic>Syzygium cumini</italic> seeds using US (22–24 kHz and 44–215 W at 35 °C for 12 min) were increased with the increase in processing time [
 <xref rid="b0230" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Maximum total flavonoid content was obtained after 12 min of processing at US power of 125 W at 35 °C for 12 min. The yields of gallic acid and catechin exhibited similar trends with 54.5 and 2.2 mg/g after 12 min [
 <xref rid="b0230" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Collectively, the above information suggests a scope for optimization where maximum bioactives could be obtained before negative effects are caused by heating or free radicals.
