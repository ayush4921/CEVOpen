<p id="p0155">In general, most studies reported that the high-intensity US can chemically and physically inactivate many kinds of enzymes [
 <xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Enzyme molecular weight is very important for the sensitivity of enzymes to the US. For example, polymeric enzymes are fragmented into monomeric subunits, and these monomeric enzymes could be subsequently fragmented further or form aggregates upon extended US treatment. Enzyme protein denaturation that inactivates enzymes is promoted by free radicals and shear forces caused by cavitation [
 <xref rid="b0465" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. For instance, US inactivated pectin methylesterase, which hydrolysis pectin and results in a product with low stability [
 <xref rid="b0470" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. A combination of US, pressure, and heat treatment (manothermosonication) showed the highest inactivation of this enzyme compared to sonication or thermosonication alone at the comparable intensity levels. The high inactivation rates by temperature and pressure could be due to their effects on pectin and other molecules that interact with the enzyme and their absence lead to reduced enzyme resistance against temperature and pressure effects [
