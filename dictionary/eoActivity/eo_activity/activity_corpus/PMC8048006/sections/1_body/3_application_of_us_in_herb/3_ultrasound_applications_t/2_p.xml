<p id="p0090">Ultrasound is useful for food composition measurement because it is non-destructive, rapid, and could be adapted for optically opaque systems. For instance, low intensity (&lt;1 W/cm
 <sup>2</sup>) or high-frequency (&gt;100Â kHz) US were used to obtain detailed information about the structure, dimensions, and composition of the plant products during the storage process [

In measuring particle size, US uses the same principles of light scattering in emulsions or suspensions. In which, US velocity and attenuation coefficient depends on the size and concentration of particles (
