<p id="p0095">Despite the beneficial effects of the US, it has been observed that US promotes several oxidation reactions and enzyme inhibitions of many food enzymes, including peroxidases, and glucosidases [
 <xref rid="b0325" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. This is probably because of the intense pressures, temperatures, and shear forces generated by the ultrasonic waves that denature proteins 
 <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Furthermore, the extreme agitation created by microstreaming could change Van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonds in the polypeptides resulting in protein denaturation such as that observed in

 <xref rid="b0330" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Free radical-mediated deactivation mechanisms and cleavage of the functional groups from enzymes could occur during US treatment and is the likely reason for the modifications in proteins and enzymes. For example, the inactivation of peroxidase as a result of haem group dissociation and the loss of iron was facilitated by hydroxyl radicals from US cavitation [
