<p id="p0140">It is worth mentioning that the extraction conditions play an important role in determining the composition of the volatiles. For example, while no significant differences were observed in alcoholic volatiles such as hexanol at 20 °C, increasing the extraction temperature to 50 °C resulted in a significant increase in alcoholic volatiles, such as α-terpineol. Therefore, US can increase the volatile extraction efficiency of medium-to-low volatiles compounds in herbs
