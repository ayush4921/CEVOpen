<p id="p0160">For polyphenol oxidase which causes enzymatic browning of natural plants, Cheng, Soh, Liew and Teh [
 <xref rid="b0480" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>] found that US (35 kHz, 20 °C for 15 min) treatment increased the enzyme activity, however, longer time (35 kHz, 20 °C for 30 min) have inactivated the enzyme (20% inactivation) due to its denaturation [

Moreover, peroxidases which are categorized as high thermal stable enzymes are associated with undesirable flavors and pigments loss was reported to be inactivated using appropriate processing conditions. In watercress herb (Nasturtium officinale), thermosonication (20 kHz, 40–92.5 °C) reduced its inactivation time from 70 to 5 s [
