<p id="p0115">Using of US has its significant effect on the carotenoids content in oil extracted from herbs. For example, Hu, Li, Qin, Zhang, Liu, Zhang, Liu, Jia, Yin, Han, Zhu, Luo and Liu [
 <xref rid="b0375" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] reported that application of US (25 kHz, 550 W, 70 °C for 38 min) in the extraction of tea (
 <italic>Camellia sinensis</italic>) oil increased β-carotene by 38% compared to conventional extraction methods. The authors suggested the increase was due to the breakage of cross-links between these compounds and other macromolecules like polysaccharides and proteins, which release the carotene in the extraction medium. However, high-intensity US application (25 kHz and 600 W at 4 °C for 6 min) significantly degraded (all-E)-astaxanthin carotenoid [

 <xref rid="b0400" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] reported that US-assisted extraction at 400 W and 40 °C for 10 min increased the extraction yields of carotenoids compared to conventional extraction (heating under magnetic stirrer method). Also, the authors mentioned that US improved the aqueous extraction of antimicrobial compounds from thyme.
