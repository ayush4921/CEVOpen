 <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] used US for synthesizing zinc oxide (ZnO) nanostructures by using 
 <italic>Hibiscus sabdariffa</italic> extract as a reducing and a stabilizing agent. In that study, the structure morphology, and photocatalytic activity were tested. X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed that hibiscus phytochemicals reduced ZnO crystallite size from 40 to 31Â nm. Also, as a consequence of band gap reduction and surface area increase, the nanostructures showed better photocatalytic degradation performance with the hibiscus extract. In another study that investigated the use of 
 <italic>Hibiscus tiliaceus</italic> chlorophyll with US to synthesis multi-walled carbon nanotubes [
 <xref rid="b0270" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The authors observed an increase in the interaction potential and covalent bonds formation with increasing of US time which led to an increase in the thickness of the nanotube by 160%. Thus, hibiscus phytochemicals are one of the promising approaches in the fabrication of nanoparticles [
