<p id="p0240">Micro/nano-Acoustic Biosensors are frequently used to enhance the activity of specific biomolecules such as enzymes for increasing the detection sensitivity. These biosensors are based on a unique class of air-filled protein nanostructures called gas vesicles that vibrate in response to US waves [
 <xref rid="b0605" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. The principle of using acoustic-based biosensors is based on coupling the measurement nature (like analyte adsorption) as a modulation in the physical properties of the acoustic wave (like US frequency and velocity) that could be correlated with the analyte concentration [
 <xref rid="b0585" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. Existing molecular biosensors, based on fluorescent emission, have limited utility due to the scattering of light and the interference with their phytochemicals' fluorescents. The use of US can easily image deep tissue with high spatiotemporal resolution. Jiang, Jin and Gui [
 <xref rid="b0610" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>] used US-assisted solvothermal reaction for bio-imaging of plant zinc-ion by using quantum dots technology. The authors suggested that the viability of the technique could be used for in-vitro cell imaging and in-vivo imaging of natural plants.
