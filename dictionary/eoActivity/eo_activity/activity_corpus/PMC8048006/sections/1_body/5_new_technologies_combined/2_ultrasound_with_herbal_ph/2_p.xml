<p id="p0225">The application of US to incorporate herbal phytochemicals in nanotechnology showed promising potential to stabilize bioactives, improve functionality and bioavailability, and delivery. High-intensity US and clove essential oil were used for producing nanofiber hydrogel using cellulose nanofiber. In this study, US (20 kHz, 4 °C) strongly increased the clove essential oil entrapment efficiency by 34%, cell viability rates by 74–101% to human gingival fibroblast cells, water retention, and color characteristics of the prepared hydrogel [

 <xref rid="b0225" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] demonstrated that coriander leaves extract can be used as a reducing agent in iron oxide nanoparticle formation by US assisted technique. The authors reported that the formed nanocomposite had substantial antimicrobial activity against pathogenic bacteria such as
