<p id="p0235">The use of US for herbal chemical composition measurement and to draw chemical images of plant tissues and visualizing their biomolecules has become one of the hot scientific research areas. An acoustic wave sensor typically consists of a piezoelectric substrate (eg. quartz crystal), coated with sensing material (polymeric film), and two interdigital transducers (one input and one output) are commonly used for chemical composition purposes [

 <sup>2</sup> = 0.987). On the other hand, there are still some limitations to these kinds of sensors. For example, QCM sensors have complex circuitry, poor signal-to-noise ratio, and can be influenced by humidity [
