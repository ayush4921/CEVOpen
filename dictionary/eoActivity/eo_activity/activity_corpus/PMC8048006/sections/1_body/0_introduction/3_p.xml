<p id="p0035">Ultrasound treatment is an acoustic technology that can be used for non-invasive detection and/or modification of herbal bioactive compounds. As a physical treatment, it can modify the chemical and physical properties of biological systems at varying levels depending on the processing conditions (e.g. frequency, intensity, and duration) and the herb's structure and composition 
 <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The technology is a green technology that offers opportunities to create new functional products or extract more powerful functional bioactive compounds from herbs. Also, it is a low energy and maintenance cost technology that has several economic benefits 
 <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. However, US is not a largescale standardized technology that could be adapted at a commercial scale for modification of herbs and other foods. A better understanding of the complex relationships among the processing conditions (frequency, power, and processing duration) and herbs structures and chemical compounds can support future applications in the herbal industry 
 <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. On the other hand, phytochemical changes can occur by free radicals that are generated by cavitation caused by the US shock wave energy. These changes in phytochemicals are considered a huge challenge for US technology. Collectively, recent research suggested that US can be considered as a viable technology in quality assurance and food safety applications
