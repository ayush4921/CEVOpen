<p id="p0065">Different combinations of frequency and intensity power are used for different US applications. High-frequency and intensity ultrasound combination is generally used for non-food applications such as soft tissue surgery, diagnostic imaging, or drug delivery [
 <xref rid="bib627" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Similarly, high-frequency and low-intensity US is used in the simulation of tissue regeneration [
 <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Low-frequency US at low or high-intensity combinations is generally used in food applications. The intensity plays a key role in forming stable cavities and imploding them (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The low-intensity US is used as a non-destructive technique for providing information about the materials' physicochemical properties, like structure, composition, and physical state. On the other hand, high-intensity US is used to change the chemical or physical properties of materials such as generating emulsions, promote certain chemical reactions, or change the functionality of proteins and carbohydrates [
 <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Low frequency and high-intensity US has been used in research to study the composition of vegetable, fruit, milk, meats, gels geopolymers, molecular interactions, and protein structures [
 <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The high-intensity US has been used to reduce microorganisms and to facilitate meat tenderization.
