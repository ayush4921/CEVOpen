<p id="p0055">The US waves are formed from the conversion of mechanical oscillation of a high-frequency electrical field, which has an elastic effect (stretching and compressing) on the deformation of ferroelectric materials [
 <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. For materials' physicochemical measurement, the US transducer emits pulses against one side of the material being analyzed and these waves are transmitted into the material. The time that the pulses take to pass through the material and return to a detector is measured and the echo velocity in the material is calculated [
