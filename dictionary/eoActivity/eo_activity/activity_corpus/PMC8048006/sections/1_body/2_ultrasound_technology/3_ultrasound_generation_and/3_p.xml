<p id="p0060">Ultrasound can be categorized according to the used frequency (kHz) and the generated energy intensity power (W). Also, it could be categorized based on sound intensity (W/m
 <sup>2</sup>) or sound energy density (Ws/m
 <sup>3</sup>) [
 <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. According to the used frequency, it can be categorized into high and low frequencies. High-frequency and intensity US are those using frequency higher than 100 kHz, and intensity from 10 to 1000 W/cm
 <sup>2</sup>, whereas the low-frequency and intensity US uses frequency lower than 100 kHz, and intensity lower than 3 W/cm
