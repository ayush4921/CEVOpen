<p id="p0050">Ultrasound is defined as any mechanical sound waves at frequencies &gt;20 kHz, which is beyond the human hearing threshold. Compression and expansion waves generated by US lead to positive and negative pressures that can create cavities in the treated materials [
 <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The formed cavities release high energy and generate high-pressure and localized extremely high temperatures [
 <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The produced shock wave energy hydrolyzes water into free radicals (H· and ·OH) and forms hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) as a byproduct. The main parameters that control the effectiveness of the treatment are the US velocity, attenuation, and acoustic impedance [
