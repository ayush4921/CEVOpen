<p id="p0075">Different US processing conditions can exert several benefits in the field of herbal science. For example, high-US penetrating power allows the detection of flaws deep in the plant parts. US increases the efficacy of the herbal extraction methods at lower temperatures and improves the rates of heat and mass transfer, cell disruption, and the penetration of solvents to the herbal tissues [

 <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>]. Also, it speeds up the filtration process, increasing the life of the filter, results in a faster drying process, and thawing operations [

 <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] demonstrated that high-intensity US (titanium horn, 19.5 kHz,140 W) is a rapid, efficient, and selective technique for rosemary (
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic>) leaf extraction and provide extracts with high bioactive compounds such as rosmarinic and carnosic acids. The application of US in herbal extraction showed a significant reduction in processing time compared to the conventional methods and the obtained extracts had slightly higher antimicrobial activity against some pathogenic species [
