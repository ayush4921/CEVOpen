<p id="p0080">On the other hand, high-US intensities (&gt;400Â W) generate heat and increase the treatment medium temperature, which may cause adverse physical and chemical effects on some herbs' phytochemicals. Thus, the intensity and energy of US should be optimized before application on different plant tissues [
