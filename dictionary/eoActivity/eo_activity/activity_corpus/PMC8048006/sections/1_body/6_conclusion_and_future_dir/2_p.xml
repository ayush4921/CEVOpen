<p id="p0255">Several studies have documented the efficacy of US for the replacement, enhancement, and improvement of various conventional processing techniques in the herbal field. Most of the reports showed that US (25–50 kHz) increases the yields of polyphenols, carotenoids, flavonoids, and essential oils depending based on the used temperature, pressure, and duration parameters. The cavitation's effects on different granules induced by ultrasonication (20–40 kHz, &lt;300 W) further facilitate the chemical, physical, and enzymatic reaction efficiency for herbal bioactive polysaccharide and protein extractions. However, higher power intensity (400–600 W) significantly oxidized and degraded some phytochemicals like (all-E)-astaxanthin carotenoid. The high-frequency US (&gt;100 kHz) is used to obtain chemical information about herbal products. The future perspective will be to combine US and herbal phytochemicals with other technologies like nanosensors and biosensors for forming advanced materials that have unique characters. In which, the optimization of the US parameters for further application development on a large scale level is a very important key role in the herbal industry. Also, US transducers' energy should be further standardizing to present a better green way compared to the commercial methods.</p>
