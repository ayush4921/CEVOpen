<p id="p0215">In a recent study, Nguyen, Gavahian and Tsai [
 <xref rid="b0325" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] compared the effects of US (150 W, 20 min) with conventional (CON), high voltage electric field (HVEF, 4000 kV m
 <sup>−1</sup> min), HPP (300 MPa, 3 min) and their combinations treatments on Gac (

 <italic>Stevia rebaudiana</italic>) leaves, in which, the highest TCC was obtained using US and HVEF treatments (20.7 and 20.4 mg/g, respectively) [
