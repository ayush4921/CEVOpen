<p id="p0220">On the other hand, combined emerging technologies (e.g., US and HPP) are considered superior to individual methods alone. For example, the combination of US and HPP increased (

The better outcome achieved by the combined technologies can be explained by the more efficient disruption of plant cell walls by US and the improved diffusion caused by HPP that enhances the release of bioactive compounds compared to their individual potentials [

 <italic>Camelia sinensis</italic>) seeds. In that study, an oil yield of 31.52% was obtained under optimum extraction conditions of MW (440 W), US (550 W), at 70 °C for 38 min compared to MW and US methods (27.45% and 25.13%, respectively) [

 <sup>−1</sup>, 30 μs), as a pre-treatment step, enhanced (

The reason could be due to the rearrangement of the phenolic molecules electric ion by PEF and PEF ability to electroporate the cell envelopes, which facilitate the improved recoveries of the US extracted bioactive compounds [
