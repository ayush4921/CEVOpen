<p id="p0205">Compared to other technologies, US technologies show high potential in the field of herbal science due to several unique advantages found in the US. From a financial point of view, it is easier and less expensive to scale-up the US technology compared to other techniques like microwave (MW), pulsed electric fields (PEF), high voltage electric field (HVEF), and high-pressure processing (HPP) methods [

 <xref rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] compared the recovery of bioactive compounds from Damiana leaves (
 <italic>Turnera diffusa</italic>) by using US, MW, heat reflux (CON), and soxhlet (SOX) extraction methods using 50% ethanol. In that study, US (20 kHz 40 °C, and 15 min) achieved the highest total phenolic yield 203.96 mg GAL/ dry leaves (DL), compared to MW (300 W, 50 °C, and 15 min) and SOX (2.4 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> Pa, 100 °C, and 6 h) with 191.36 and 161.62 mg GAL/DL. Similarly, the US increased (

 <italic>Panax ginseng</italic>) herb by 31.1%, 19.5%, and 12.1% compared to CONV, MW, and SOX methods, respectively. Additionally, Panadare, Gondaliya and Rathod [
