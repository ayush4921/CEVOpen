<p id="p0210">Carbone, Macchioni, Petrella and Cicero [

 <italic>Humulus lupulus</italic>). They mentioned that MW (2.45 GHz, 2.4 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> Pa, 210 °C, and 1 min) resulted in a higher extraction power for its phenolic contents (95 mg GAL/g) than US (40 kHz, 25 °C, and 30 min) with 25 mg GAL/g. This study suggested that in terms of yield, the efficacy of the US will depend on the plant/ material used, and thus optimization reported in the literature cannot be extrapolated to other materials. In the study of Carbone and colleagues [
 <xref rid="b0550" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>], it is important to highlight that US treatment did not use high power like MW (2.45 GHz, 210 °C, 2.4 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> Pa), which could have a negative effect on the phytochemicals structure and function. In terms of selectivity, treating rosemary leaves with US (19.5 kHz,140 W) showed remarkably high (
