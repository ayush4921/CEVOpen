<p>Fresh 
 <italic>L. petersonii</italic> leaves were harvested from Durban, South Africa while other defatted (spent) leaves were obtained from an essential oil production facility. The fresh leaves (160 g) were hydro-distilled to extract the essential oil component. This step was skipped for defatted spent leaves obtained from essential oil production facility. The recovered hydro-distilled product was further extracted with hexane to yield 12 mL of the essential oil. The defatted marc (crude) was combined with the spent leaves (100 g) and subjected to solvent extraction using methanol. The resulting methanolic crude extract was partitioned with hexane, and then with dichloromethane (DCM), as represented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05487-f004">Figure 4</xref>. The hexane extract was further purified to yield a target flavonoid compound which was characterized using spectroscopic methods. The DCM extract was suspected to contain triterpenes according to preliminary tests and the literature. The bioactivity of the methanolic crude extract before hexane and DCM extraction and the isolated flavonoid were tested in the antioxidant and antimicrobial assays.
