<p>It was initially suggested that the flavonoid constituent of 
 <italic>Leptospermum</italic> species might be responsible for its medicinal properties given its wide application in folk medicines as a sedative, and in the treatment of respiratory infections and diarrhea [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-25-05487" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], however, this study has shown that, although the flavonoid exhibited levels of antioxidant activities, there may be other constituents of the crude extract which may influence the overall biological activities. It is, however, noted that the total phenol content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC) should be determined and correlated with the results of the antioxidant assays to corroborate this hypothesis in further studies.
