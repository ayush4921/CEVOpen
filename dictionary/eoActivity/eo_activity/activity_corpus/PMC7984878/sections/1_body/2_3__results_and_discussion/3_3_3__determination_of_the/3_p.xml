<p>Among the tested bacteria, the multiresistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MRSA) was considered as sensitive to all Eos tested (zone inhibition: 14 to 15 mm) except for the Saudi Arabian Eo which gave a moderately sensitive activity (10 mm). As depicted in the same table, 
 <italic>A. baumannii</italic> (12.5 to 13.5 mm) and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (10.06 to 12.5 mm) were deemed as moderately sensitive to all origins of Eos. Based on the zone inhibition (8 to 9.5 mm), the 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> was regarded as slightly sensitive to the volatile compounds of the four countries. The comparison of the inhibition activity according to the origin was not significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05), while the comparison between all strains tested is very highly significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).
