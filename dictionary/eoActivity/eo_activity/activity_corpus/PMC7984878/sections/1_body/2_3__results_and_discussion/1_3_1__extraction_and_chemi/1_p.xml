<p>The essential oils (Eos) of five 
 <italic>NS</italic> samples belonging to five countries (India, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Syria, and France) were obtained by the hydrodistillation method in a yield ranging from 0.047% to 1.7%. The composition of the Eos was investigated using the GC-MS technique, and the identification of their constituents was accomplished based on the comparison of their MS data with those stored in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST147) computer library. The chemical components and the chromatograms of the studied oils are shown in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, respectively. Of all of the identified compounds, monoterpenes constituted the highest percentage (55.81 to 96.68%). The data show that the major components were found to be 
 <italic>α</italic>-phellandrene, 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene, 
 <italic>β</italic>-cymene, and 4-caranol, respectively, for 
 <italic>NS</italic> collected from India, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, and Syria. Oil compositions of France were characterized by the occurrence, at appreciable content, of estragole and D-limonene.
