<p>The sensitivity test showed that the different strains were resistant towards the used antibiotics, and no inhibition diameter was observed on the agar plate. Concerning the ESBL, the double-disc synergy method in Mueller Hinton agar was used. The amoxicillin clavulanic acid inhibits the production of beta-lactamases which create a synergic effect with cephalosporins third generation which highly suggest the production of ESBL.</p>
