<p>From a dendrogram produced by HCA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), the 
 <italic>NS</italic> populations can be classified into two main clusters at a distance of 25 units. Samples connected by a shorter distance are more similar than those connected by a longer distance. In the closer distances (∼5 units), the examined populations were divided into three groups (Gr 1 to 3). The first group (cluster I), represented by three samples originating from Saudi Arabia, Morocco, and Syria, was rich in 
 <italic>α</italic>-phellandrene (20.03–30.54%) and had a relatively moderate level of 
 <italic>β</italic>-cymene (12.31–23.82 %) and 4-caranol (9.77–14.27%). The second group, containing the sample of India and which is furthest from the other populations of cluster I, is characterized by the highest percentage of 
 <italic>β</italic>-chamigrene (9.54%).
