<p>PCA analysis revealed that the first two principal components represented 82% of the phytochemical variance. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3</xref> shows the 2D graphical representation of PCA. As shown in the figure, the first principal component (PC1) accounted for 57% of the total variance, correlated positively with 
 <italic>α</italic>-phellandrene, 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene, 
 <italic>β</italic>-cymene, and 4-caranol which were predominant in oils of 
 <italic>NS</italic> collected from Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Syria, and India. On the other hand, PC1 correlated negatively with D-limonene and estragole which were predominant in oils of 
 <italic>NS</italic> originated from France. The second principal component, accounting for an additional 25% of the total variance, was positively correlated with 
 <italic>β</italic>-chamigrene. These PCA data lead to the classification of the 
 <italic>NS</italic> into three main groups which represent the following chemotypes: 
 <italic>α</italic>-phellandrene/
 <italic>β</italic>-cymene/4-caranol (Saudi Arabia, Morocco, and Syria), 4-caranol/
 <italic>β</italic>-cymene/
 <italic>α</italic>-phellandrene/
 <italic>β</italic>-chamigrene (India), and estragole/D-limonene (France). This classification confirmed the HCA results.
