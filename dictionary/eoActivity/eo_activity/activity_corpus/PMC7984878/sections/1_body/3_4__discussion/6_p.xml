<p>In another study, the Eos showed an important activity on different multiresistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains, but no effect was observed on

 <italic>E. coli</italic> where the Eos were not active in all tested concentrations which was different from our findings where the Eos were active on 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> with a MIC (20
