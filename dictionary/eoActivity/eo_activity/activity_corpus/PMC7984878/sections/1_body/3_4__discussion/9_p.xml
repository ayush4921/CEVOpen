<p>The 
 <italic>Î²</italic>-cymene, a carvacrol precursor of one of the major compounds present in all samples tested with a percentage between 12.31 and 23.82%, has an important affinity to the liposomal membrane which causes its extension [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and it was also found that cymene has no significant effect on protein synthesis in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> while a significant effect was observed on motility decreasing [
