<p>The research of Saad and Muller [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] shows that the hydroxyl group present on the thymol is responsible for the antimicrobial activity. Mosolygó et al. [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] have shown that the thymol, a monoterpene present in the essential oil of India (4.64%), Saudi Arabia (8.39%), and Morocco (7%), exhibits an antibacterial activity on both 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, and the MIC obtained was, respectively, 0.31 and 5 mg/ml. It was also reported that the thymol causes widening of the cell membrane which leads to a passive diffusion of ions between the spread phospholipids toward the external area [
