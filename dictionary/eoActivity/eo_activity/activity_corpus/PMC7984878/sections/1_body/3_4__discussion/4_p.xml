<p>The obtained results indicate that the Eos originated from the four countries studied exert an antibacterial activity that was more potent in Gram-positive than the Gram-negative bacteria, and this could be due to the presence of an intrinsic system of resistance to Eos. Man et al. [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] indicated that the reaction of bacteria depends mainly on their morphology (bacterial wall), the peptidoglycan present on the Gram-positive bacterial wall allows the hydrophobic molecules to reach the internal environment, while the lipopolysaccharide present on the Gram-negative bacteria enables the passage of small hydrophilic molecules which are not affected by the resistance, and this is due to the abundance of porin proteins [
