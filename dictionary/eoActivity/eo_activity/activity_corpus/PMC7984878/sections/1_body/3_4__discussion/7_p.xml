<p>Işcan et al.'s [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] study has revealed that 
 <italic>α</italic>-phellandrene, the major compound in the Eos belonging to Saudia Arabia, Morocco, and Syria (20.03–30.54%), has a weak antibacterial activity toward several bacterial strains such as 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MRSA), 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> at a concentration that varies from 1 to &gt; 4 mg/ml. It was also mentioned that 
 <italic>α</italic>-phellandrene could contribute to the antibacterial effect [

 <italic>β</italic>-pinene present in the Eos of the different countries studied with a percentage ranging from 4.53–9.77% and 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene present in Moroccan (6.29%) and Syrian (4.07%) Eos have showed an important inhibitory activity of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> with an MIC value equal to 20
