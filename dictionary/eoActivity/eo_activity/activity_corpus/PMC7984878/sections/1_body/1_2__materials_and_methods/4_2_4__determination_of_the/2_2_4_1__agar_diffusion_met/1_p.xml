<p>The agar diffusion method was used as a preliminary test for the determination of the Eo antibacterial activity. The turbidity of all strains was standardized to 0.5 McFarland to facilitate the comparison between them. Afterward, the strains were inoculated on the surface of a Petri dish of Muller Hinton Agar (MHA) using a sterilized swab. Sterilized Whatman filters (6 mm in diameter) were saturated with 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of Eo dissolved in 2% DMSO, and then, they were placed on the surface of the Petri dish previously inoculated with microorganisms using forceps. After 24 hours of incubation at 37°C of all the dishes, the antibacterial activity was assessed by measuring the diameter of the growth-inhibition zone in millimeter. The measurements of inhibition zones were carried out three times for each Eo [
