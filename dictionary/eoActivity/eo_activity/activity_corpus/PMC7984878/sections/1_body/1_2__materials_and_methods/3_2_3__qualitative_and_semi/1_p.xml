<p>The analysis was performed using a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-2010) equipped with a fused-silica capillary column (5% phenyl methyl siloxane, 30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 
 <italic>μ</italic>m film thickness) coupled with a mass spectrometer detector (GC-MS-QP2010). The helium as a carrier gas was adjusted to a constant pressure of 100 KPa. The oven temperature was set initially at 50°C (maintained for 1 minute) followed by a gradient of 10°C/min up to 250°C (maintained for 1 minute). The temperatures of the injector, transfer line, and ion source were set at 250°C, 250°C, and 200°C, respectively. For the qualitative and semiqualitative analysis (

 <italic>μ</italic>L of the samples diluted in hexane (50 mg/g) were injected in split mode (split ratio = 50–80), and the GC-MS system was operated in scan mode. Mass spectra were recorded at 70 eV (electron impact ionization mode) with an m/z range of 40–350 a.m.u (rate and solvent delays were 5 s/scan and 4.5 minutes, respectively). Identification of the essential oil constituents was accomplished based on the comparison of their MS data with those stored in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST147) computer library. LabSolutions (version 2.5) was used for data collection and processing.
