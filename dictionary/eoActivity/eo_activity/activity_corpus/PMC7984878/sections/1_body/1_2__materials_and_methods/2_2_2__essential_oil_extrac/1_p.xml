 <italic>NS</italic> samples were placed in the shady room to be naturally dried until their weight was stable for (6 days) approximately. The fully dried samples were turned to a fine powder before hydrodistillation. Then, 100 g of plant material in 300 ml of water were subjected to hydrodistillation using a modified Clevenger-type apparatus until the essential oil level was stable (2 to 3 h). After the extraction, anhydrous sodium sulfate was used to remove water trace, and the essential oil was stored in an airtight glass container in a refrigerator at 4°C until the analysis.
