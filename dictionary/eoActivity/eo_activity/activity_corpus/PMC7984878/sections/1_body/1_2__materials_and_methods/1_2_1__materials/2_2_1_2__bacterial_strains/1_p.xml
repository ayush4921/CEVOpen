 <italic>S.aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>E.coli</italic>, 
 <italic>P.aeruginosa,</italic> and 
 <italic>A.baumannii</italic>) were clinically isolated from patients and identified at the microbiology laboratory of the University Hospital Centre Mohammed VI of Oujda (Morocco). Their sensitivity toward antibiotics was verified according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST). The chosen strains are representative of the most commonly involved pathogen-resistant bacteria in human infections.
