<p>The chemical compounds identified in this work using GC-MS were obtained by hydrodistillation followed by a study of the chemical variation and an evaluation of their antibacterial effect. Despite the geographical distribution of 
 <italic>NS</italic> seeds, a great similarity was observed in oil composition and also on the activity exhibited on multidrug-resistant bacteria. Gram-positive organisms were generally more sensitive to Eos than gram-negative organisms. Thus, 
 <italic>NS</italic> Eos provide a rich source of phytochemical compounds that could be used in the treatment of different infectious diseases caused by microbial agents.
