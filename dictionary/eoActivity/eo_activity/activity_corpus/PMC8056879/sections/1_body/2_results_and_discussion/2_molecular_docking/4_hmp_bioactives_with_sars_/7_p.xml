<p id="p0150">However, the dire situation of SARS-CoV-2 has been further escalated due to the emergence of highly fit SARS-CoV-2 variants [
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Currently, various strains of SARS-CoV-2 with several mutations of its proteins have been reported. For example, one of the mutations, R408I, in the spike protein happens to lie in the receptor-binding domain. This mutation has been reported to increase the stability of the spike protein [
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Also, R60C mutation in the 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> was observed to have an impact on the root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) of the protein structure. Further, MD simulation results revealed that the ligand-binding affinity to the mutated 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> was decreased compared to the wild type 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> [

In another study, D614G mutation in the spike protein and P323L mutation in the RdRp protein has been reported to have a high incidence of 43.27% and 43.21%, respectively. These mutations were not reported to have a significant change in the protein structure. However, D614G mutation in the spike protein has been observed to cause an increase in viral infection. Mutations Q57H and G251V in the ORF3a protein and mutations S194L and R203K/G204R in the nucleocapsid protein were observed to cause a structural change in the respective proteins [
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. These reports indicate mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 proteins may reduce the binding efficiency of HMP bioactives. Thus, to overcome the limitations of SARS-CoV-2 mutations, we have identified HMP bioactives that can target multiple protein targets. Hence, apart from the mutated proteins, HMP bioactives can also bind with other target proteins and may likely attenuate the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2.
