<p id="p0160">It was observed that viral infection pathways, immunity, and apoptosis were common for both bioactives and SARS-CoV-2 targets. Enrichr was used to perform gene ontology (GO) enrichment of biological processes concerning 
 <italic>p</italic>-values obtained by Fisher exact test for bioactives and SARS-CoV-2. Further, after redundancy removal using Revigo, scatterplot revealed distinct clusters of GO terms of biological processes for HMP bioactive targets and SARS-CoV-2 targets (
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> ). Each cluster represents semantically similar GO terms. Regulation of protein kinase B signaling (PKB/Akt) and cytokine-mediated signaling pathways were the most enriched term among biological pathways for the HMP bioactives and SARS-CoV-2, respectively (
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Biological process enrichment analysis revealed that bioactives and SARS-CoV-2 targets commonly regulate the cytokine and apoptosis signaling pathways. MAPK pathway, shown to be targeted by the bioactives, is activated upon external stress.
