<p id="p0115">RdRp is another essential target of SARS-CoV-2 that plays a vital role in the replication and transcription cycle of viruses [
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. RdRp, also called nsp12, in a complex with nsp7 and nsp8, executes the viral genome's replication. The active site of RdRp has remained conserved for many viruses and consists of motifs A-G (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A). Motif A consists of residues 611–626, where Asp618 is a critical divalent-cation-binding residue. Ser759, Asp760, and Asp761 are other catalytic residues that are a part of motif C. Nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) entry channel consist of motif F residues Lys545, Arg553, and Arg555 [

Standard drug remdesivir interacted with RdRp by forming H-bonds with Arg553, Arg555, Tyr619, Lys621, and Ser682 as well as hydrophobic interactions with Asp623, Asp760, Asp761 as displayed in 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> B. Among HMP bioactives, hypericin (−8.9 kcal/mol) had the highest binding affinity, followed by pseudohypericin (−8.6 kcal/mol), candibirin G (−8.5 kcal/mol), catechin 5-O gallate (−8.0 kcal/mol), and candibirin H (−7.9 kcal/mol) (

 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Hypericin strongly binds at the catalytic site of RdRp by forming H-bonds with Tyr619, Lys621, Cys622, Asp760, and Ser814 as well as hydrophobic interaction with Asp618 (

 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>C). Like hypericin and remdesivir, other selected HMP bioactives interact with the NTP entry channel and active site of RdRp (
