<p id="p0185">ADME/T estimation is used to predict the pharmacological parameters such as absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity of a compound. After human intestinal absorption (HIA), compounds reach into circulation. Caco-2 permeability mimics the HIA 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> system. Hence, we have evaluated the ADME/T properties of selected HMP bioactives and are represented in 
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> . We have found that among selected HMP bioactives, candibirin G, candibirin H, and hypericin have shown optimal Caco-2 permeability and human intestinal absorption. Also, all the selected bioactives function as P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-inhibitor; however, none of them function as P-gp-substrate. Therefore, the retention time of bioactives inside the cells will be enhanced, which may promote the activity of the bioactives. After absorption, these selected bioactives have shown a lesser binding affinity towards plasma protein (PPB); consequently, the bioavailability of these bioactives may enhanced. After distribution to the different organs, bioactives are metabolized in the liver by different metabolic enzymes, especially cytochrome P450 enzymes [
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. We have found here that some of the bioactives function as CYP450 enzyme substrates, which are metabolized quickly through these enzymes. In contrast, some bioactives have CYP450 enzyme inhibitory potential, which hinders the metabolism. The half-life of these selected HMP bioactives is low except for hypericin. Besides, we have not found any adverse toxicity of the selected HMP bioactives 
 <italic>in silico</italic>. None of the selected bioactive compounds have shown hepatotoxicity, though candibirin G and candibirin H have shown minimal hepatotoxicity. Most of the selected bioactives function as moderate hERG blockers. Moderate hERG blockade may produce a beneficial class III antiarrhythmic effect [
