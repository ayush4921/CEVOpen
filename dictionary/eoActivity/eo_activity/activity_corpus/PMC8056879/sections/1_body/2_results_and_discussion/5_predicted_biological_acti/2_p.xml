<p id="p0190">Several possible biological activities of the selected HMP bioactives were predicted using the prediction of activity spectra for substances (PASS) webserver. Two factors evaluate biologically active compounds; Pa signifies the probability “to be active”, and Pi signifies the probability “to be inactive”. The value of both factors ranging from 0 to 1. Here, we found most of the bioactives function as potent membrane integrity agonists and membrane permeability inhibitors. Besides, they also have anti-inflammatory, antitussive, and anti-viral activities, especially against the influenza virus. Among them, tribulosin may likely function as respiratory analeptic to recover from respiratory depression. Intriguingly, several HMP bioactives have shown anti-viral activity against several genera of viruses, as shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> . These results suggest that HMP bioactives have pleiotropic biological activities that can enhance the therapeutic application against COVID-19.
