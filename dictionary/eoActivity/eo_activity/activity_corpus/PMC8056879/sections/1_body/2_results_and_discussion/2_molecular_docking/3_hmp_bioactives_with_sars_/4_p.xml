<p id="p0110">SARS-CoV-2 PLpro comprises four domains: ubiquitin-like, finger, thumb, and palm domains, as demonstrated in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A. There is a high structural similarity between PLpro of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and they share an 82.9% sequence identity and a 100% sequence identity for the binding site [
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The active site of PLpro consists of a catalytic triad of residues Cys111, His272, and Asp286 and is located between the thumb and the palm domains [

 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>]. Among the selected HMP bioactives, hypericin had a higher BE of −7.6 kcal/mol than the standard drug remdesivir (−6.2 kcal/mol) (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Hypericin formed H-bonds with Cys270 and Lys274 of PLpro of SARS-COV-2 and had hydrophobic interactions with Trp106, Gly271, His272, and Asp286 at the active site (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C). The interactions of hypericin were similar to the interactions of standard drug remdesivir such as H-bonds with Lys105, His272, and Lys274 as well as hydrophobic interactions with Trp106, Asp286, Ala288, and Leu289 (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B). The HMP bioactives, including candibirin H, candibirin G, catechin 5-
 <italic>O</italic>-gallate, and pseudohypericin were interacting with the catalytic site of PLpro, which are displayed in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>. Ki for selected HMP bioactives was in the range of 2–15 μM, as shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.
