<p id="p0145">Overall, among HMP bioactives, hypericin from 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> has shown its potential in targeting all the six proteins involved in the replication and transmission of COVID-19. The presence of hypericin makes 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> a primary photosensitizer. In clinical trials, hypericin appeared in the blood after a single oral administration of 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> extract. Furthermore, the steady-state level of hypericin in the blood has been observed after long-term dosing. The polyphenol fraction of 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> has shown immune-stimulating activity, whereas the lipophilic portion has shown immunosuppressing properties. Moreover, in acute toxicity studies, the extract has led to a relatively nontoxic effect in rats, guinea pigs, and mice [

 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> extract is used in more than 50 cosmetic formulations, and the oil in more than ten products. Therefore, this extract with other combinations of HMP bioactives may likely be used to make formulations to inhibit COVID-19 infection and transmission.
