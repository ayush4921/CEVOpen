<p id="p0105">SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> is an attractive drug target as it plays an essential role in the proteolytic maturation of pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins involved in the replication and transcription of SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> is a cysteine protease with His41-Cys145 active site, and the substrate-binding site is situated in the cleft between domain I and II, as shown in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A [
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Molecular docking results of standard drug and selected bioactives from HMPs with 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> revealed that these bioactives firmly bind at the catalytic dyad of 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>. Standard drug remdesivir formed four H-bonds with 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> residues Leu141, Gly143, His163, and Glu166, furthermore various hydrophobic contacts at the active site (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B). Similarly, bioactives from HMPs such as candibirin H formed four H-bonds with 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> residues Asn142, Gly143, Cys145, and His163, besides various hydrophobic interactions at the active site (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C). Similarly, selected HMP bioactives candibirin G (BE: -9.1 kcal/mol), catechin 5-
 <italic>O</italic>-gallate (BE: -8.2 kcal/mol), hypericin (BE: -8.8 kcal/mol), and pseudohypericin (BE: -8.5 kcal/mol) have shown a higher binding affinity with the 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> and formed strong H-bonding and non-bonded interactions with its active site, as shown in 
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>. These results suggest that the selected HMP bioactives may likely inhibit the 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> activity. The inhibition constant (Ki) calculated for the selected HMP bioactives with 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> are summarized in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The candibirin H bears the lowest Ki value with 180 nM, and the remaining Ki values for the selected HMP bioactives were in the range between 220 and 990 nM.
