<p id="p0140">Besides, HMP bioactives also had strong interactions with hotspot residues of the ACE2 receptor. Bioactives 6,6′-biapigenin, hypericin, and tribulosin had interaction with residues of hotspot Lys31 of ACE2 receptor. Bioactives kaempferol 3-glucoside 7-rhamnoside, kaempferol 7,4′-diglucoside, and tribuloside interact with residues hotspot Lys353 of ACE2 (

 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>B and C. The Ki was also calculated for the selected HMP bioactives with spike protein and ACE2 and are summarized in 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Ki for the selected HMP bioactives with spike protein and ACE2 were found to be less than 40 μM stating that the selected HMP bioactives have a significant binding affinity with these target proteins. On the other hand, targeting ACE2 may have several biological consequences, such as functional deterioration of the heart and progression of cardiac, renal, and vascular pathologies. However, elevated levels of the catalytic active ACE2 were found in the SARS-CoV-2 infected patients [
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This might be due to the infiltration of immune cells such as macrophages and neutrophils, which overexpressed the ACE2 during the infection. Therefore, like other diseases, the dose of the HMP bioactives needs to be adjusted to effectively reduce the elevated expression of ACE2 into the basal level. Further, the interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding motif with hotspot residues of ACE2 differs from the active site of ACE2. Spike protein receptor-binding motif interacts with hotspot residues Lys353 and Lys31 with S1 subunit. Hence, targeting the ACE2 receptor holds an advantage in the attenuation of spike protein interaction and attachment.
