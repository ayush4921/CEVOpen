<p id="p0130">To understand the potential capability of HMP bioactives against transmission targets SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human ACE2 receptor, molecular docking analysis were carried out along with the standard drugs. Similar to the replication targets, among the standard drugs remdesivir also had a superior binding affinity and bound with spike protein and ACE2 receptor having a BE of −6.6 kcal/mol and −6.4 kcal/mol, respectively (
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). Among HMP bioactives, hypericin had the highest binding affinity with spike protein (−8.3 kcal/mol), and tribuloside had a higher binding affinity with ACE2 (−7.4 kcal/mol). Based on the BEs of standard drug and HMP bioactives, we set the cut-off BE of −7.0 kcal/mol, and −6.5 kcal/mol for spike protein and ACE2, respectively. These cut-off binding energies were used to select the superior HMP bioactives as described in section 
 <xref rid="sec3.1.1" ref-type="sec">3.1.1</xref>. Based on the cut-off binding energies, six bioactives from HMP bioactives were selected for protein-ligand interaction studies and biological pathway enrichment analysis. The selected HMP bioactives were 6,6′-biapigenin, hypericin, kaempferol 3-glucoside 7-rhamnoside, kaempferol 7,4′-diglucoside, tribuloside, and tribulosin and their BE, as well as interactions, are summarized in
