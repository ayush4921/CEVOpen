<p id="p0125">SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is made up of S1 and S2 domains. The S1 domain forms the receptor-binding domain (RBD) (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A), whereas the S2 domain forms the membrane fusion protein. The RBD of spike protein recognizes and binds to the human ACE2 receptor of the host cell and thus infecting the host cell. Molecular analysis of spike protein receptor-binding motif (RBM) and human ACE2 complex revealed different spike protein residues, and hotspot residues of the ACE2 receptor are involved in the virus's interaction with the host cell. The ACE2 receptor comprises two viral-binding hotspots: Lys31 (hotspot 31) and, Lys353 (hotspot 353) (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>A). Hotspot 31 includes a salt bridge between Lys31 and Glu35, and hotspot 353 composed of a salt bridge between Lys353 and Asp38 covered in a hydrophobic environment. The spike protein's vital amino acid residues include Leu455, Phe486, Gln493, and Ser494, which bind to the ACE2 receptor [
