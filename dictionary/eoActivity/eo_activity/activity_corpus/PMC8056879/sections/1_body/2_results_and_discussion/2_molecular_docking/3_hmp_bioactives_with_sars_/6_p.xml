<p id="p0120">SARS-CoV-2 helicase forms a triangular-pyramid shape that consists of five domains. These five domains are formed by two RecA-like domains, namely 1A and 2A, present near the core of C terminal helicase, the N-terminal Zinc binding domain (ZBD), the beta-barrel domain (1B), and the stalk domain, which connects 1B and ZBD (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A). The helicase enzyme's ATP binding site has hydrolytic activity, which comprises residues Lys288, Ser289, Asp374, Glu375, Gln404, and Arg567, which is present in the cleft between 1A and 2A domain base. This implies that inhibiting the NTPase activity by blocking the ATP binding site of the enzyme can lead to helicase inhibition [

Intriguingly, our docking study revealed that the selected HMP bioactives bind at the cleft between 1A and 2A of the enzyme, implying that these bioactives may disrupt ATP binding. Standard drug remdesivir docked at the active site (BE: -8.0 kcal/mol) and formed H-bonds with Gly285, Thr286, Gly287, Lys288, Ser289, His290, and Arg443 as well as several hydrophobic interactions, as given in

 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B. Among HMP bioactives, candibirin H had the lowest BE (−9.1 kcal/mol) and formed three H-bonds with Gly285, Ala312, and Ala316 (
