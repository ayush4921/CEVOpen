<p id="p0175">Enrichr results for KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications and nitrogen metabolism was most enriched for bioactives. Influenza A and Epstein-Barr virus infection were most enriched for SARS-CoV-2 (
 <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> A). Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are present in higher levels in diabetic patients. SARS-CoV-2 infection increases COVID-19 severity and also the risk of mortality in diabetic patients [

Hence, implying that these bioactives may help control the risk of mortality in patients who have COVID-19 along with comorbidities such as diabetes and renal dysfunction. KEGG enrichment analysis for SARS-CoV-2 targets revealed a pathway associated with Influenza A as both lead to respiratory distress.
