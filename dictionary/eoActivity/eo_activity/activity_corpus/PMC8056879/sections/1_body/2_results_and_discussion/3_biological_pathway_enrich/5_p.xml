<p id="p0170">Further, the bioactives target the PKB/Akt, which is involved in metabolism, cell proliferation, and cell survival. 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) helps to regulate the PKB/Akt pathway. Upon infection by SARS-CoV, 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> interacts with PDK1, thereby hindering its interaction with PKB/Akt. This lowers PKB/Akt phosphorylation. As a result, apoptosis is induced in the viral affected cells [

Another pathway targeted by bioactives in the calcium-mediated pathways. Viruses are known to disrupt calcium homeostasis, thus altering the membrane permeability and promoting viral infection into the cell [
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Hence, bioactives might likely be used to target the calcium-mediated pathways to disrupt the entry of the viral genome.
