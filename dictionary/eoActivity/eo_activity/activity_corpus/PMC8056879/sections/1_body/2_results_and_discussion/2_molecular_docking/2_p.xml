<p id="p0095">Our current study intended to identify potential HMP bioactives against the replication, maturation, and transmission targets of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we have utilized molecular docking analysis to identify therapeutic agents from HMPs against COVID-19. Molecular docking is a versatile tool that predicts the binding efficiency and interactions between the therapeutic compounds and protein targets. SARS-CoV-2 viral life cycle provides several therapeutic targets to develop treatment options against the virus. Among these, targeting replication, maturation, and transmission of the virus hold great potential. Thus, we have chosen SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, PLpro, RdRp, and helicase as replication and maturation targets. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human ACE2 receptor were chosen as transmission targets to identify potential bioactives from HMPs that can probably inhibit SARS-CoV-2 using molecular docking analysis.
