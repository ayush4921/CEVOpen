<p id="p0100">Initially, we performed molecular docking analysis with standard anti-retroviral drugs with replication and maturation targets. Among the standard drugs, remdesivir is the FDA recommended emergency use authorization (EUA) drug for SARS-CoV-2 treatment, which had superior binding affinities towards 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> (BE: -8.3 kcal/mol), PLpro (BE: -6.2 kcal/mol), RdRp (BE: -7.1 kcal/mol), and helicase (BE: -8.0 kcal/mol). The results are summarized in 
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table S3</xref>. After that, we obtained BEs of HMP bioactives against these targets. Among HMP bioactives, candibirin H had the highest binding affinity with 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> (−9.2 kcal/mol) and helicase (−9.1 kcal/mol), whereas hypericin had a higher binding affinity with PLpro (−7.6 kcal/mol) and RdRp (−8.9 kcal/mol). Based on the BEs of standard drug and HMP bioactives, we set the cut-off BE of −8.0 kcal/mol for 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, −6.5 kcal/mol for PLpro, −8.0 kcal/mol for RdRp, and −7.5 kcal/mol for helicase. Based on the cut-off BEs, potential HMP bioactives were further narrowed for protein-ligand interaction studies and biological pathway enrichment analysis. The criteria selected were based on (i) the cut-off BEs, and (ii) having a higher binding affinity towards all the targets of SARS-CoV-2. Five HMP bioactives such as candibirin H, candibirin G, catechin 5-
 <italic>O</italic>-gallate, hypericin, and pseudohypericin yielded superior BE values against SARS-CoV-2 replication and maturation targets, and their interactions with protein targets were analyzed.
