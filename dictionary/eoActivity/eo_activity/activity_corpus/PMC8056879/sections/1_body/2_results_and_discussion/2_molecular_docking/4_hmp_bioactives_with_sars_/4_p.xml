<p id="p0135">Standard drug remdesivir (BE: -6.6Â kcal/mol) formed five H-bonds at the spike protein receptor-binding motif, including Arg403, Tyr453, Gln493, Gly496, and Asn501, as well as hydrophobic interactions with Leu455, Phe456, and Tyr489 (

Firm binding and impeding interaction between spike protein receptor-binding motif and ACE2 receptor provide a crucial opportunity to hinder the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. In line with this, HMP bioactives were also found to bind at the receptor-binding motif of spike protein firmly. For example, hypericin makes H-bonding with Ser494 and hydrophobic interactions with Tyr449, Leu452, Leu492, and Gln493 residues of spike protein RBM (
