<p id="p0045">After the viral genome's release into the host cell, it leads to complex viral gene expressions. Initially, ORF1a and ORF1b from the viral genome is translated into pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins. Two vital proteins process these polyproteins, i.e., 3-chymotrypsin-like proteinase (3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>)/main proteases (M
 <sup>pro</sup>) and papain-like protease (PLpro), into several non-structural proteins (nsps), which are involved in SARS-CoV-2 genome replication. Several nsps, including nsp12, i.e., RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and nsp13, i.e., helicase, are engaged in the SARS-CoV-2 viral replication machinery [
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Thus, 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, PLpro, RdRp, helicase, spike protein, and human ACE2 are the crucial proteins involved in the SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle and might be valuable targets for intervention of COVID-19.
