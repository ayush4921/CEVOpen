<p id="p0050">Host response against SARS-CoV-2 has a significant influence on the severity of COVID-19. Cytokine production, the hyperinflammatory response against the virus, and comorbidities will significantly impact COVID-19 disease progression [
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Fever, cough, sore throat, headache, fatigue, breathlessness, diarrhea, muscle pain, and sputum production are commonly observed symptoms in COVID-19 patients [
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. On the other hand, in the advanced stages of COVID-19, patients suffer from acute respiratory distress syndrome, loss of speech or movement, chest pain or pressure, and severe cardiac injury, leading to death. Extensive research is going on different anti-viral drugs, vaccines, and therapeutic formulations to treat the SARS-CoV-2. Currently, a sequential clinical trial of anti-viral drugs in combination has been investigated against COVID-19. The combination of nitazoxanide, ribavirin, and ivermectin is under phase III clinical trials against COVID-19 (Clinical trial# NCT04392427). Furthermore, the FDA-approved remdesivir is the first emergency drug for treating hospitalized COVID-19 patients over the age of 12. However, there is a lack of confidence in the effectiveness of drugs or vaccines against COVID-19, even when the number of new cases, new viral strains, and mortality rates are still increasing globally.
