<p id="p0060">Therefore, the Himalayan ayurvedic plant's formulation can be used alone or tested with an approved drug to treat COVID-19. The computational biology approach is required to predict the effective drugs or formulation from Himalayan medicinal plants (HMPs) against COVID-19. In the current study, we have selected HMP bioactives, which are traditionally used for cold, cough, fever, bronchitis, and asthma, and investigated their potentialities against COVID-19 by targeting the viral proteins involved in replication, maturation, and transmission to the host using computational approaches. Further, the therapeutic roles of the selected HMP bioactives were also analyzed using biological pathway enrichment analysis.</p>
