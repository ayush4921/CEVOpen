<p id="p0040">The viral life cycle initiates with the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cell. The entry of the virus takes place through the host cell receptor interaction by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Spike protein is a vital structural protein that recognizes the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and facilitates viruses' binding to the host cells [
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Spike protein is composed of S1 and S2 subunits, wherein the S1 subunit recognizes the ACE2 receptor and binds it, following which S2 subunit helps the viral membrane fusion with the host membrane resulting in the release of the viral genome into the host cell [

Intriguingly, the spike protein binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2 receptor is ten to twenty-fold higher than SARS-CoV, which might have contributed to the higher infection and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with previous coronavirus infections [
