<p id="p0195">The unending COVID-19 pandemic has increased morbidity and mortality across the globe. Our study revealed that the selected HMP bioactives formed stable interactions with SARS-CoV-2 target proteins involved in viral infection and replication. The selected HMP bioactives were found to bind with a higher affinity at the active sites of replication target proteins and receptor-binding motif as well as hotspot residues of the transmission targets. Among them, hypericin from 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> is the most potent compound, which actively targets all six proteins involved in replicating and transmitting COVID-19. Numerous literature has also shown the health beneficiary role of hypericin, and currently, several hypericin-based products are available in the market. Therefore, the hypericin extract can be used in several phyto/food formulations with other selected potential HMP bioactives to treat the COVID-19. The Ki values of the selected HMP bioactives were also lower than 40 μM affirming that these bioactives have firm interactions with the target proteins. Further, the pathway enrichment analysis revealed that pathways related to immunity and apoptosis were common to both HMP bioactive targets and SARS-CoV-2 targets. Thus, it can be said that these HMP bioactives can be used to regulate these pathways by targeting the SARS-CoV-2 proteins. In addition, the selected HMP bioactives were also found to have multiple biological activities, which also enhances their utility against SARS-CoV-2 treatment. However, we have also observed that most of the selected bioactives have poor intestinal and GI absorptions but lower toxicity; therefore, we can adapt different procedures such as nanotechnology, nanoformulation, or pharma-nutraceutical formulation to enhance the absorption of these compounds. By these processes, we can improve the efficacy and reduce the off-target effects of HMP bioactives. Hence, the current study warrants further investigations to test the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> effects of the selected HMP bioactives against the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
