<p id="p0065">The selection of HMPs was based on a thorough search of the existing traditional use of the different parts of the plants against respiratory-related viral diseases, as summarized in 
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table S1</xref>. The ethnopharmacological use of selected HMPs was well documented and found a lack of scientific validation. Therefore, in the current study, we identified forty-two bioactives from seventeen HMPs for the computational investigation against the potential targets of SARS-CoV-2 as summarized in 
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table S2</xref>. Further, the potential bioactives were selected based on the highest binding affinity towards target proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The three-dimensional structures of standard drugs and HMP bioactives were retrieved from the PubChem database (

Several anti-retroviral proteases, RdRp, and human ACE2 inhibitors (Darunavir, remdesivir, ritonavir, losartan, and enalapril) were selected as the standard drugs for docking analysis against SARS-CoV-2 target proteins (
