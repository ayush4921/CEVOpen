 <sup>pro</sup>, PLpro, RdRp, helicase, spike protein, and human ACE2 receptor were used as the target molecules for docking with the bioactives from HMPs. Molecular docking was carried out using AutoDock Vina [

 <sup>pro</sup>, PLpro, RdRp, helicase, and the interacting crucial residues of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-human ACE2 receptor complex using Autodock tools with dimensions relative to the ligands (XYZ) with a resolution of 1 Å [

Protein-ligand interactive models were selected based on the binding energies (BEs), the potential hydrogen bonds (H-bonds), and hydrophobic interactions. Protein-ligand interaction profiler (PLIP) (
