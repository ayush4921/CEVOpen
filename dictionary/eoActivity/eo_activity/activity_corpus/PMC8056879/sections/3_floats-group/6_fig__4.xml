  <p>(A) Secondary structural representation of SARS-CoV-2 helicase (cartoon and surface representation) consists of five domains viz., RecA-like domains, namely 1A and 2A, zinc-binding domain (ZBD), the beta-barrel domain (1B), and the stalk domain. ATP-binding site is highlighted in a square box. The remdesivir (yellow) and candibirin H (sky blue) at the ATP-binding site are also displayed in the square box with its close-up view (rightmost panel). (Bâ€“C) 3D stereo figures demonstrating molecular interactions of SASR-CoV-2 helicase (PDB ID: 
   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:6ZSL" id="intref0080" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">6ZSL</ext-link>) with remdesivir (B) and with the bioactive from HMP, candibirin H (C) are shown. The structural elements of bioactives and their corresponding molecular interactions are represented and colored as in
