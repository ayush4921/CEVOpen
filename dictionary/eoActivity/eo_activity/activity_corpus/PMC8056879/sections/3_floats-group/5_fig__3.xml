  <p>(A) Secondary structural representation of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (cartoon and surface representations) consists of domains viz., finger, thumb, and palm domains. The catalytic site is highlighted in a square box. Remdesivir (yellow) and hypericin (sky blue) at the substrate-binding site are also shown with its close-up view (rightmost panel). (Bâ€“C) 3D stereo figures demonstrating molecular interactions of SASR-CoV-2 RdRp (PDB ID:
