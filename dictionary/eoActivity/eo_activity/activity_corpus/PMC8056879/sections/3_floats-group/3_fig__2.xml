  <p>(A) Secondary structural representation of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro (cartoon and surface representations) consists of four domains viz., ubiquitin-like, finger, thumb, and palm domains. The catalytic site is highlighted in a square box. Remdesivir (yellow) and hypericin (sky blue) at the substrate-binding site are also shown, and its close-up view is displayed in the rightmost panel. (Bâ€“C) 3D stereo figures demonstrating molecular interactions of SASR-CoV-2 PLpro (PDB ID: 
   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:7JRN" id="intref0070" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">7JRN</ext-link>) with remdesivir (B) and with bioactive from HMP hypericin (C) are shown. The structural elements of bioactives and their corresponding molecular interactions are shown and colored as represented in
