  <p>(A) Secondary structural representation of SARS-CoV-2 3CL
   <sup>pro</sup> (cartoon and surface representation) consists of domain I (blue), domain II (green), and domain III (orange). The His41-Cys145 catalytic dyad is shown in the sphere and colored red and blue, respectively. The substrate-binding site is highlighted in a square box, docked molecules remdesivir (yellow) and candibirin H (sky blue) are shown in the ball-and-stick model, and its close-up view is shown in the rightmost panel. (B–C) 3D stereo figures demonstrating molecular interactions of SASR-CoV-2 3CL
   <sup>pro</sup> (PDB ID: 
   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:6LU7" id="intref0065" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">6LU7</ext-link>) with remdesivir (B) and bioactive from HMP candibirin H (C) are shown. The 3CL
   <sup>pro</sup> residues making H-bond are shown in the ball-and-stick model, and carbon atoms are colored green. The 3CL
   <sup>pro</sup> residues, which make hydrophobic interactions, are shown in the sphere (purple). H-bond interactions are shown in dotted lines, and the corresponding distances (Å) are marked. The remdesivir and candibirin H are also shown in the ball-and-stick model, and the carbon atoms are colored green and cyan, respectively. The oxygen and nitrogen are colored red and blue for both bioactives.
