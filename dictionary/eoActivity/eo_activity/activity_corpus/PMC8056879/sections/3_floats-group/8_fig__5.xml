  <p>(A) Secondary structural representation of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (cartoon and surface representation) containing spike protein receptor-binding motif. The receptor-binding motif is represented as spheres (spheres represent different critical residues of receptor-binding motif yellow: Leu455, red: Gln493, pink: Asp501, purple: Ser494, and grey: Phe486). The docked molecules remdesivir (yellow) and hypericin (sky blue) at the receptor-binding motif are also shown with its close-up view (rightmost panel). (Bâ€“C) 3D stereo figures demonstrating molecular interactions of SASR-CoV-2 spike protein (PDB ID:

The structural elements of bioactives and their corresponding molecular interactions are represented and colored as in
