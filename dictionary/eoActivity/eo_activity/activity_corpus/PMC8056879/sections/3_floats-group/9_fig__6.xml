  <p>(A) Secondary structural representation of human ACE2 (cartoon and surface representation) representing hotspot spike-protein binding regions. Viral-binding hotspots are defined in a square box. The molecules remdesivir (yellow) and kaempferol 7,4′-diglucoside (sky blue) docked near the hotspot residues also highlighted in the square box with its close up view (rightmost panel). (B–C) 3D stereo figures demonstrating molecular interactions of human ACE2 (PDB ID:
