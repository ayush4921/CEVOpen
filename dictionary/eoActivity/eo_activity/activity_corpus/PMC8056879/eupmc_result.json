    "<h4>Background</h4>Identification and repurposing of therapeutic and preventive strategies against COVID-19 are rapidly undergoing. Several medicinal plants from the Himalayan region have been traditionally used to treat various human disorders. Thus, in our current study, we intended to explore the potential ability of Himalayan medicinal plant (HMP) bioactives against COVID-19 using computational investigations.<h4>Methods</h4>Molecular docking was performed against six crucial targets involved in the replication and transmission of SARS-CoV-2. About forty-two HMP bioactives were analyzed against these targets for their binding energy, molecular interactions, inhibition constant, and biological pathway enrichment analysis. Pharmacological properties and potential biological functions of HMP bioactives were predicted using the ADMETlab and PASS webserver respectively.<h4>Results</h4>Our current investigation has demonstrated that the bioactives of HMPs potentially act against COVID-19. Docking results showed that several HMP bioactives had a superior binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2 essential targets like 3CL<sup>pro</sup>, PLpro, RdRp, helicase, spike protein, and human ACE2. Based on the binding energies, several bioactives were selected and analyzed for pathway enrichment studies. We have found that selected HMP bioactives may have a role in regulating immune and apoptotic pathways. Furthermore, these selected HMP bioactives have shown lower toxicity with pleiotropic biological activities, including anti-viral activities in predicting activity spectra for substances.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Current study results can explore the possibility of HMPs as therapeutic agents against COVID-19."
