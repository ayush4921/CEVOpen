<p>Since antiquity, the essential oils from 
 <italic>C. nepeta</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>nepeta</italic> leaves have been used as a fragrance and insect repellent [

 <italic>C. nepeta</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>nepeta</italic> and 
 <italic>C. n.</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>glandulosum</italic> have been reported up to now; they have a very attractive smell and are often visited by insect pollinators. As far as we know, nothing is reported on the chemical profile and biological efficacy of their essential oils.
