<p>All across the globe, environmental problems such as soil and water pollution and food contamination are continuously increasing, inducing many disasters and human tragedies. The excessive and indiscriminate use of available pesticides to control the losses of stored crops and to reduce insect-borne diseases as malaria, filaria and trypanosomiasis induced disturbances in ecosystem functioning [

 <xref rid="B2-molecules-25-02137" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Moreover, synthetic fungicides and fungal-drugs utilization to treat environmental and animal molds are not in a lesser class, when we talk about the negative effects and the appearance of fungicide-resistant pathogens [

 <xref rid="B4-molecules-25-02137" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Therefore, there is an increasing concern to search for new highly selective and eco-friendly alternatives of beneficial pest control materials to feed the growing human population in a healthy environment. Medicinal plants produce an arsenal of chemical compounds that alleviate various illnesses and rebalance human health. Much attention has been focused on the study of plant extracts and essential oils due to their pivotal role as a source of phototherapeutics widely used to fight infectious diseases [

 <xref rid="B6-molecules-25-02137" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Natural insecticides, fungicides and herbicides with promising effects have the properties to supplant or replace synthetic organic pesticides and therefore to avoid environmental contamination. Hence, various applications of essential oils acting as safe fungicidal agents against a large number of molds and as environmentally friendly insecticides have been reported [

Importantly, the nature of the produced secondary metabolites and essential oils influences the mechanisms of actions and determines the medicinal and economic utility of various plants. In this context, differences in essential oils productivity, including an increase or decrease in the yields, and variation of the chemical composition depending on harvesting phase (vegetative, pre-flowering, flowering and fruiting), as well as the plant geographical origin have been previously investigated [
