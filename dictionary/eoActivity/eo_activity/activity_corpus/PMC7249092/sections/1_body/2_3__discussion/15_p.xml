<p>The results showed that the repellent action was dependent upon the subspecies 
 <italic>nepeta</italic> or 
 <italic>glandulosum,</italic> while no significant differences were detected between the ability of both samples of 
 <italic>glandulosum</italic> subspecies collected in Bizerta and Béni-M’tir regions to repel or kill the insects. Using the McDonald method, both essential oils at a concentration of 2% showed almost the same repellent activity against 
 <italic>T. confusum</italic> and 
 <italic>S. zeamais</italic> adults after 2 h of exposure. The percentages of repellency were 95 and 87.5% for CNG
 <sub>1</sub> and CNG
 <sub>2</sub>, respectively, on 
 <italic>T. confusum</italic> and 92.5% for both essential oils on 
 <italic>S. zeamais</italic>. These oils fall under repellency class V (Highly Repulsive) according to Jilani and Su. [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-25-02137" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, 57.5% repellency of 
 <italic>C. nepeta</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>nepeta</italic> essential oil was observed against both adult insects, thus the volatile oil falls under class III repellency (Moderately Repulsive).
