<p>Some interesting observations were made on the diversity of the secondary metabolism of 
 <italic>C. nepeta</italic> essential oils. Almost three types of volatile oils can be distinguished with some exceptions [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-25-02137" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The first and most popular one consists mainly of pulegone associated with other cyclohexanones as menthone and piperitenone, along with piperitone oxide and piperitenoneoxide. The second kind of essential oil obtained from 
 <italic>Clinopodium</italic> taxa is characterized by the predominance of piperitenone and/or of piperitone oxides, with the last one correlated with the presence of 
 <italic>iso</italic>-pulegone and 1,8-cineole [
