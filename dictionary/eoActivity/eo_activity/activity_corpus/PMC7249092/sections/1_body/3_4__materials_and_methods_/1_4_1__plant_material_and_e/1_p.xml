<p>The aerial parts of well-selected individuals from two native 
 <italic>C. nepeta</italic> subspecies, i.e., subsp. 
 <italic>nepeta</italic> and subsp. 
 <italic>glandulosum</italic>, were harvested during the flowering stages from different regions/localities in North and North-Western of Tunisia (

Botanical identification of uninfected plant materials was authenticated by Dr. Ridha El Mokni, affiliated to the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences “A”, Laboratory of Botany, Cryptogamy and Plant Biology, Faculty of Pharmacy of Monastir, Tunisia, where the voucher specimens have been preserved (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-02137-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). A quantity of 100 g of each sample was subjected to hydrodistillation in a glass Clevenger-type apparatus for 3 h. The oily fraction obtained on top of the aqueous phase at the end of each extraction was separated, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and stored in the refrigerator until further analysis. The extraction yields were estimated on a dry weight basis (
