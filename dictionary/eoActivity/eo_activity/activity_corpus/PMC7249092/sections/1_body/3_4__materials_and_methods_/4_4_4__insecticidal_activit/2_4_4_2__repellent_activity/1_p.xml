<p>The repellency test against 
 <italic>T. confusum</italic> and 
 <italic>S. zeamais</italic> beetle adults was assessed following McDonald et al. [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-25-02137" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] method. Briefly, 200 μL of each essential oil solution, adjusted at a concentration of 2.0%, were applied to a half Whatman filter paper (No.1) disc of 9 cm diameter. The other half, used as a control, was steeped with 200 μL of pure acetone. After air-drying for 10 min, treated and untreated halves were attached together. Then, 20 adult insects of both species were released separately at the center of the filter paper disc then placed into Petri dishes. After 15, 30, 60, and 120 min from the beginning of the assay the numbers of insects present on the control (Nc) and on the treated (Nt) areas were registered. Each experiment was performed in four repetitions. The repellency percentage values (PR) were computed as follows:
