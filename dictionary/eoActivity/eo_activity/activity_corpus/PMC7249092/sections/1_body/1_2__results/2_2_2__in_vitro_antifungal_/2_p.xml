<p>In general terms, the tested fungal isolates showed a variable degree of sensitivity patterns to the selected essential oils. The Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) ranged from 0.04 to 2 mg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. It was found that 
 <italic>A. terreus</italic> and 
 <italic>M. canis</italic> molds were moderately sensitive to all tested samples exhibiting a MIC value of 0.4 mg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. It is relevant to note that the CNG
 <sub>1</sub> essential oil was considerably able to inhibit the fungal growth rate of 
 <italic>T. mentagrophytes</italic> dermatophyte (MIC = 0.04 mg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>).
