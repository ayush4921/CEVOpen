<p>The obtained results showed that 
 <italic>Clinopodium nepeta</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>nepeta</italic> and 
 <italic>C. nepeta</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>glandulosum</italic> essential oils presented chemical variability depending on the subspecies and the geographical location of plant materials. The monoterpenoid-rich essential oils demonstrated high antifungal activities against dermatophytes, molds and yeasts with different efficiencies. Given the pronounced repellent and toxic effects towards 
 <italic>T. confusum</italic> and 
 <italic>S. zeamais</italic>, 
 <italic>C. nepeta</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>glandulosum</italic> oils may be considered as promising candidates to control those insect pests during storage. To better understand the pharmacological effects of the analyzed samples, further investigation on the effective major compounds will be carried out. Added to that, an exploration of the synergistic interactions, the antagonist effects and the environmental safety is imperative before suggesting them as fungal drugs or safe alternatives to grain protectants.
