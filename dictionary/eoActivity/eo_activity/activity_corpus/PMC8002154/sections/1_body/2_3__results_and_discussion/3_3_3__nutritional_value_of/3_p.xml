<p>As mentioned previously, SOB is a good source of protein and, interestingly, DSOB has a higher protein content. As shown in 
 <xref rid="foods-10-00538-t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>, non-essential amino acids in DSOB proteins are completely dominant. In particular, glutamic acid (14.24 g/100 g protein) was highest in DSOB, followed by arginine (6.72 g/100 g protein), aspartic acid (6.16 g/100 g protein), proline (5.76 g/100 g protein), glycine (4.88 g/100 g protein), serine (4.32 g/100 g protein), and alanine (2.72 g/100 g protein). Regarding essential amino acids, leucine (4.40 g/100 g protein) had the highest levels, followed by phenylalanine (3.52 g/100 g protein), valine (3.12 g/100 g protein), threonine (2.32 g/100 g protein), lysine (2.32 g/100 g protein), isoleucine (1.68 g/100 g protein), cysteine (1.52 g/100 g protein), tyrosine (1.52 g/100 g protein), histidine (1.28 g/100 g protein), and methionine (1.09 g/100 g protein). Overall, the amino acid content of DSOB was less than that of SOB but exhibited no significant differences. DSOB protein quality was further assessed by CS, EAAI, and BV. The CS of the essential amino acids in DSOB, based on egg protein, showed values between 31.11 and 58.18, and Iso was the first restricted amino acid; the EAAI of 44.84 and BV of 37.15 in DSOB indicated that overall levels of essential amino acids were relatively low.
