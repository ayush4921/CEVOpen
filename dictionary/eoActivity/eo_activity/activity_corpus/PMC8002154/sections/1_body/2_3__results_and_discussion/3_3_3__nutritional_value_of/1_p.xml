<p>The nutritional and energy values of DSOB are presented as dw in 
 <xref rid="foods-10-00538-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, using SOB as a reference. Carbohydrates (72.60 g/100 g dw) were the main nutrient in DSOB, followed by protein (15.86 g/100 g dw), ash (8.86 g/100 g dw), and fats (2.68 g/100 g dw). However, carbohydrate, protein, ash, and fat content in SOB were 56.34, 12.80, 7.00, and 23.86 g/100 g dw, respectively. All nutritional values, except fats, were higher in DSOB than those in SOB. Seeds are normally a fat reservoir; thus, fats are the major macronutrients in SOB, ranking only second to carbohydrates. Compared to SOB, the proportion of fats in DSOB was greatly reduced by oil extraction, which led to decreased biomass and thus an increased nutritional content (carbohydrates, proteins, and ash) in disguise. The energy of SOB was 491.33 Kcal/100 g dw, calculated on the basis of its carbohydrate, protein, and fat content. A lower energy was observed for DSOB (378.00 Kcal/100 g dw) due to its lower fat content, since fats are the main contributor to energy.
