<p>As shown in 
 <xref rid="foods-10-00538-t008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>, the amounts of four macroelements (Na, K, Ca, and Mg) and four microelements (Fe, Mn, Cu, and Zn) in DSOB and SOB were determined. Among the macroelements, Na (1121.67 mg/100 g dw) was present in the highest amount in DSOB, followed by Ca (1106.77 mg/100 g dw), Mg (320.88 mg/100 g dw), and K (259.63 mg/100 g dw). Regarding the microelements, Fe (50.35 mg/100 g dw) exhibited the highest level, followed by Mn (7.22 mg/100 g dw), Zn (3.6 mg/100 g dw), and Cu (0.40 mg/100 g dw). Overall, the DSOB mineral content was significantly higher than that of SOB, except for K and Cu. The daily requirement of macroelements is approximately 100 mg to maintain activity. However, only a few milligrams, even micrograms, of microelements are required per day, as their name suggests. Thus, DSOB was a good source of minerals for dietary supplementation, especially Ca and Fe.
