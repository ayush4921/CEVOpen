<p>The amount and type of carbohydrates to eat is an important consideration for patients with diabetes when planning their diet. As shown in 
 <xref rid="foods-10-00538-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>, the predominant sugars in DSOB were found to be sucrose (1.27 g/100 g dw) and glucose (0.16 g/100 g dw), whereas other sugars were not detected. Briefly, there was 0.13 g/100 g dw maltose in SOB, and the contents of sucrose (0.99 g/100 g dw) and glucose (0.13 g/100 g dw) in SOB were significantly lower than those in DSOB. However, both DSOB and SOB presented low levels of monosaccharides and disaccharides. Furthermore, a higher fiber content was observed in DSOB (34.78 g/100 g dw) compared to that in SOB (29.40 g/100 g dw). These results demonstrated that DSOB had a lower glycemic index, thereby reducing the health risks induced by sugars.
