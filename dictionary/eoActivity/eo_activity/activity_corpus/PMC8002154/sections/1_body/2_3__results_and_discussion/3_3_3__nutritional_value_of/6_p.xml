<p>The tocopherol contents (α-, β-, and γ-isoforms) have been determined, as shown in 
 <xref rid="foods-10-00538-t009" ref-type="table">Table 9</xref>. Only one isoform of tocopherol (γ-) was identified and quantified in DSOB (1.11 mg/100 g dw) and SOB (11.61 mg/100 dw). Compared to SOB, the low tocopherol content in DSOB was likely related to its low fat content.
