<p>The antioxidant capacities of DSOB were further assessed using five assays, namely, O•, NO, ONOO
 <sup>−</sup>, DPPH, and ABTS, on the basis of the antioxidant mechanisms of electron transfer and ROS scavenging [
 <xref rid="B19-foods-10-00538" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. HO• is the main ROS in the body, inducing oxidative stress that breaks down DNA strands and damages proteins [
 <xref rid="B25-foods-10-00538" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. As shown in 
 <xref rid="foods-10-00538-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00538-f002">Figure 2</xref>, DSOB scavenges 45.18% HO• at 3.33 mg/mL. Although the HO• scavenging capacity of DSOB was significantly lower than that of SOB and ascorbic acid, these results implied that DSOB contained potent HO• scavengers. NO provides vascular protection; nevertheless, the highly reactive radical, ONOO
 <sup>−</sup>, is formed when NO interacts with superoxide radicals, leading to a series of harmful events [
 <xref rid="B26-foods-10-00538" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. DSOB showed good antioxidant activities against NO (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.08 μg/mL) and ONOO
 <sup>−</sup> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 512.49 μg/mL), with no significant difference with SOB. DSOB also showed excellent scavenging capacities for ABTS (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.22 μg/mL) and DPPH (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 15.62 μg/mL) radicals, with no significant difference compared to SOB. These findings demonstrated that DSOB is a good natural antioxidant.
