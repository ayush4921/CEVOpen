<p>To better understand the polyphenol composition of DSOB, we performed LC–ESI–QTOF/MS because it provides high-resolution mass data containing affluent structural information of the analyte. In this work, 25 components in DSOB have been identified, including (+)-catechin, ellagic acid, gallic acid, procyanidins, quercetin, syringic acid, and their derivatives, as listed in 
 <xref rid="foods-10-00538-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. Among the 25 compounds, 14 compounds were reported to be α-glucosidase inhibitors, 13 compounds were reported to be aldose reductase inhibitors, and 21 compounds were reported to be antioxidants. Interestingly, although the profiles of the polyphenol composition in DSOB and SOB were similar (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00538-f003">Figure 3</xref>), the quantities of each component in DSOB and SOB were quite different (
 <xref rid="foods-10-00538-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Among the 25 compounds, the amounts of syringic anhydride, trimethylenglykol-digalloat, monogalloylglucose, ellagic acid glycoside, ellagic acid xyloside, syringic acid, ellagic acid, quercetin glucuronide, and kaempferol glucuronide were higher in DSOB than those in SOB. The amounts of digalloylglucose, galloylxy trihydroxyflavanone, (+)-catechin, catechin gallate, methyl ellagic acid, procyanidins, and procyanidin B gallate were lower in DSOB than those in SOB. The differences in biological activities between DSOB and SOB may be caused by differences in the content of these polyphenols.
