<p>In recent years, an increase in the incidence of diabetes associated with lifestyle has led to a search for effective and safe methods of prophylaxis and/or therapy. The results of epidemiological studies indicate that diabetes may be prevented by enriching diets with plant foods, since these foods are rich in polyphenols with pharmacological activity [

 <xref rid="B28-foods-10-00538" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Over the last few years, SOB has attracted wide attention because of its high polyphenol content. However, understanding of the polyphenols in DSOB remains limited. Therefore, the DSOB TPC and TFC were tested using SOB as a reference, and the results are listed in 
 <xref rid="foods-10-00538-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The TPC of DSOB was 48.91 mg GAE/g dw, significantly higher than that of SOB (33.10 mg GAE/g dw). The TPC of grape seed and green tea were 86 and 74 mg GAE/g dw, respectively [

These findings indicated that DSOB was a bulky reservoir of polyphenols. Therefore, the aforementioned remarkable bioactivities of SOB may be associated with its high phenolic and flavonoid content; the polyphenol composition of DSOB needs to be further illustrated.
