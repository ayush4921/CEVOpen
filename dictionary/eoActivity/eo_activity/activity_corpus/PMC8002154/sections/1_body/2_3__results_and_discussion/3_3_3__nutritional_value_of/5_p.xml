<p>Two organic acids (oxalic acid and citric acid) were identified in DSOB and SOB. As shown in 
 <xref rid="foods-10-00538-t009" ref-type="table">Table 9</xref>, oxalic acid levels in DSOB are 255.30 mg/100 g dw, which is significantly lower than that in SOB (584.65 mg/100 g dw). In contrast, citric acid in DSOB (363.26 mg/100 g dw) was significantly greater than that in SOB (171.67 mg/100 g DW). Organic acids are a key indicator of food quality and serve as synergists to improve the activity of antioxidants. However, oxalic acid is an anti-nutrient whose high dietary intake results in the formation of calcium oxalate crystals, decreasing the absorption of Ca and increasing the risk of kidney stones. From this point of view, DSOB was more applicable for dietary supplementation than SOB.
