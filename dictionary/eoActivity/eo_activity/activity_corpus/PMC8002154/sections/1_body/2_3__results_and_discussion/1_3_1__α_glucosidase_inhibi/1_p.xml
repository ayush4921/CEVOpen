<p>α-Glucosidase inhibitors from natural sources are often used as functional foods for intervening in postprandial hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes. Thus, the effect of DSOB on α-glucosidase inhibition was first investigated to assess its potential as a functional food ingredient in diabetes. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00538-f001">Figure 1</xref>A, DSOB inhibited α-glucosidase activity by 1.47%, 72.41%, and 88.52% at concentrations of 1, 5, and 10 μg/mL, respectively. SOB decreased α-glucosidase activity by 2.52%, 69.33%, and 96.22% at 1, 5, and 10 μg/mL, respectively. The α-glucosidase inhibitory capacity of DSOB was lower than that of SOB at 10 μg/mL and showed no significant differences at 1 and 5 μg/mL. As shown in 
 <xref rid="foods-10-00538-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, DSOB had an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 3.31 μg/mL for α-glucosidase inhibition, which showed no significant difference compared to the IC
 <sub>50</sub> of SOB (3.18 μg/mL). Interestingly, both DSOB and SOB showed dramatically higher α-glucosidase inhibitory capacities than acarbose. Grape seed and green tea are popular functional food ingredients that possess excellent α-glucosidase inhibitory activities. In a previous study, Yilmazer-Musa et al. reported that grape seed has an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1.2 μg/mL for α-glucosidase inhibition, green tea has an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.5 μg/mL for α-glucosidase inhibition, and acarbose has an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 91 μg/mL for α-glucosidase inhibition [

 <italic>Phellinus merrillii</italic> has an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 13.73 μg/mL for α-glucosidase inhibition [
 <xref rid="B23-foods-10-00538" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. These results implied that DSOB was a potent α-glucosidase inhibitor, in which the α-glucosidase inhibitory activity of DSOB was not affected by the defatting process from SOB. This work is the first report to indicate the α-glucosidase inhibitory activities of DSOB and SOB.
