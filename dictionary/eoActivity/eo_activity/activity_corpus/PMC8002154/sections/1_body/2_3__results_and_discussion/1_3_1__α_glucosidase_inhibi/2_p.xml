<p>Recently, the development of naturally derived aldose reductase inhibitors with less toxicity as functional foods has attracted much attention. Our previous research has reported that SOB is a potent aldose reductase inhibitor [

Therefore, in the present study, the inhibitory effect of DSOB on aldose reductase was also investigated using rat lens to assess its potential as a functional food ingredient in diabetes. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00538-f001">Figure 1</xref>B, DSOB decreases the catalyzing activities of aldose reductase by 23.79%, 72.33%, and 82.63% at concentrations of 1, 5, and 10 μg/mL, respectively. SOB decreased rat lens aldose reductase activities by 17.56%, 57.89%, and 79.70% at 1, 5, and 10 μg/mL, respectively. The inhibitory effects of DSOB at 1 and 5 μg/mL on rat lens aldose reductase were significantly higher than those of SOB. Moreover, DSOB has a significantly lower IC
 <sub>50</sub> (2.56 μg/mL) than that of SOB (3.44 μg/mL), as shown in 
 <xref rid="foods-10-00538-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Huang et al. reported that fruiting body of 
 <italic>Phellinus merrillii</italic> has an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 12.55 μg/mL for aldose reductase inhibition [
 <xref rid="B23-foods-10-00538" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Although the aldose reductase inhibitory activity of DSOB was much lower than that of epalrestat, these results indicated that DSOB was an excellent natural origin aldose reductase inhibitor, and the defatting process from SOB seemed to improve its inhibition.
