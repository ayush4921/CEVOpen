<p>Proteins extracted from SOB or DSOB were hydrolyzed with hydrochloric acid at 110 °C for 21 h, and then filtered using a 0.22 μm membrane for injection into a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (UltiMate 3000; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) instrument equipped with a fluorescence detector (UltiMate 3000; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Separation was achieved using a ZORBAX Eclipse-AAA column (150 mm length, 3.0 mm i.d., and 3.5 μm particle size; Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) at 35 °C. The samples (10 μL) were eluted with sodium dihydrogen phosphate solution (40 mM in water, pH 7.8, (A) and acetonitrile–methanol–water solution (45:45:10,

The excitation and emission wavelengths of the fluorescence detector were 340 nm and 450 nm, respectively. Amino acids were identified by comparing the retention times with those of the standards and were further quantified using calibration curves. Moreover, the chemical score (CS), essential amino acid index (EAAI), and biological value (BV) were calculated using the following equations:
 <disp-formula>CS = EAA in sample protein/EAA in egg protein × 100

 </disp-formula>
 <disp-formula>EAAI = [(Lysines × Leucines × ··· × Histidines)/(Lysiner × Leuciner × ··· × Histidiner)]
  <sup>1/n</sup>
  <label>(3)</label>
 </disp-formula> where “EAA” is essential amino acids, “s” is essential amino acid in sample, “r” is essential amino acid in whole egg, and “n” is amount of amino acids (assuming “Phenylalanine + Tyrosine,” and “Methionine + Cysteine” are together).
