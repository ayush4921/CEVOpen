The obtained extracts were concentrated at 37 °C using a rotary evaporator (RE-2000A; YARONG, Shanghai, China) under vacuum, lyophilized (FreeZone 4.5; Labconco, Kansas City, MO, USA), and stored at −20 °C for the determination of TPC, TFC, polyphenols, and antioxidant capacities. TPC was determined using the Folin–Ciocalteu colorimetric method and expressed as gallic acid equivalents (GAE) [
