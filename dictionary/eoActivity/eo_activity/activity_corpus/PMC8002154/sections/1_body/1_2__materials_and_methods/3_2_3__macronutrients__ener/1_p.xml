<p>Macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and ash), energy, and sugars (glucose, fructose, galactose, lactose, maltose, and sucrose) were determined using Association of Official Agricultural Chemists methods [
 <xref rid="B15-foods-10-00538" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Specifically, the amount of protein was assessed using the micro-Kjeldahl method (N × 6.25). Ash was evaluated by calcining at 550 ± 10 °C for 5 h. Fats were measured using a Soxhlet apparatus. Carbohydrates were estimated using difference analysis. Glucose, fructose, lactose, maltose, and sucrose contents were determined using ion chromatography, and the energy value was calculated as follows:
 <disp-formula>Energy (kcal/100 g dry weight [dw]) = 4 × (g/100 g dw proteins + g/100 g dw carbohydrates) + 9 × (g/100 g dw fats)
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula>
