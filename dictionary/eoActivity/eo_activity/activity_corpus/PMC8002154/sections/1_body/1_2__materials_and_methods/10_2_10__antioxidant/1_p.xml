<p>The antioxidant capacities of SOB and DSOB were assessed using electron transfer assays (DPPH and ABTS) and ROS scavenging assays (HO•, NO, and ONOO
 <sup>−</sup>). The DPPH, ABTS, HO•, and NO scavenging assays were performed as reported by Kwon et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-foods-10-00538" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The ONOO
 <sup>−</sup> scavenging assay was carried out as reported by Hazra et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-foods-10-00538" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. BHT and Trolox were used as positive controls for the DPPH and ABTS assays, respectively. Ascorbic acid was used as the positive control for HO•, NO, and ONOO
 <sup>−</sup> scavenging assays. The antioxidant activities were expressed as the percentage of radical elimination (%) and the sample concentration for 50% inhibition (IC
 <sub>50</sub>).
