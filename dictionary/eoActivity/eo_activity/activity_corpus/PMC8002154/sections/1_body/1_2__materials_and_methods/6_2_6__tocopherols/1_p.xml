<p>Tocopherols in SOB and DSOB were determined using the UltiMate 3000 HPLC system with a UV detector (UltiMate 3000), as previously described with some modifications [
 <xref rid="B16-foods-10-00538" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Briefly, 2 g of the samples were mixed with methanol (4 mL), 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane (4 mL), and saturated sodium chloride water solution (2 mL). The clear upper layer was collected and filtered for further HPLC analysis. The Eclipse Plus C18 column (150 × 4.6 mm, 3.5 μm; Agilent) was used for separation. Samples were eluted with methanol at 0.7 mL/min and detected at 300 nm. Tocopherols (α-, β-, and γ-isoforms) were confirmed and quantified using standard compounds with calibrated curves.
