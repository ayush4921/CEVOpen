<p>The α-glucosidase inhibition assay was performed as previously reported [
 <xref rid="B6-foods-10-00538" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Specifically, a mixture of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4, 90 μL), sample solution (20 μL), 
 <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenyl-α-D-glucopyranoside solution (30 μL, 1 mM in PBS), and α-glucosidase solution (60 μL, 15 μg/mL in PBS) were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Acabose was used as a positive control. Then, the absorbance of the incubated mixture was measured at 405 nm using a microplate reader (Synergy HTX, BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA). The inhibitory activity was expressed as the percentage inhibition (%) and the IC
 <sub>50</sub>.
