<p>Organic acids (oxalic acid and citric acid) in SOB and DSOB were extracted by meta-phosphoric acid and subsequently analyzed by HPLC-UV (UltiMate 3000) at 215 nm and 210 nm, respectively. Sodium dihydrogen phosphate solution (0.01 mol/L, pH 3.5) was used as the mobile phase. The eluent was monitored using an Ultimate AQ-C18 column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm; Welch Materials, Shanghai, China) that was used for separation at 35 °C. Compounds were identified by comparison with standards and further quantified using calibration curves [
