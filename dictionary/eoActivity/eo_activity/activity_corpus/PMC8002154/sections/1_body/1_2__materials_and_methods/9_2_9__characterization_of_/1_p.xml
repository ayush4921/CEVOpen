<p>The DSOB and SOB polyphenols were characterized using an LC–ESI–QTOF/MS instrument (XEVO G2, Waters, Milford, MA, USA) for tentative identification. Separation was accomplished at 30 °C using a CORTECS C18 column (50 × 2.1 mm, 1.6 μm; Waters). SOB or DSOB (4 μL) were eluted with acidified water (0.1% formic acid, (A) and organic solutions (acetonitrile/methanol = 3:1,

 <italic>v</italic>, (B) at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. The following were used as the optimized gradient chromatography conditions: 5–20% B at 0–2 min, 20–30% B at 2–5 min, 30–40% B at 5–7 min, 40–100% B at 7–10 min. Peak identification was performed in both negative and positive modes, and mass spectra in the

 <italic>z</italic> range of 50–1000 were obtained. The mass spectrometry conditions were as follows: source temperature, 120 °C; desolvation temperature, 450 °C; gas flow rate, 800 L/h; and nebulizer gas pressure, 6.5 bar. The capillary voltage was set to 2.0 kV. Data acquisition and analysis were performed using MassLynx V4.1 SCN 901 (Waters). The polyphenols were temporarily identified by comparing the literature and searching the library using UNIFI (Waters). The content ratio of polyphenols in DSOB and SOB were calculated by peak areas in TIC.
