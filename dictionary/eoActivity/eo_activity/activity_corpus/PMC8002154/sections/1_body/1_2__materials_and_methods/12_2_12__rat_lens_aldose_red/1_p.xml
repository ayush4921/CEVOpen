<p>The rat lens aldose reductase inhibition assay of SOB and DSOB was performed as described previously [
 <xref rid="B21-foods-10-00538" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In brief, the eye lens of Wistar rats (10 weeks old, weight 250–280 g) were collected and homogenized for further centrifugation. The rat lens aldose reductase remained in the supernatant. Then, 900 μL of a total mixture of NADPH (0.16 mM), ammonium sulfate (2.5 mM), DL-glyceraldehyde (2.5 mM), rat lens aldose reductase, and samples were incubated, and the activity of aldose reductase was determined by measuring the decrease in NADPH absorbance at 340 nm for 3 min using a spectrophotometer. Epalrestat was used as a positive control. The inhibitory activity was expressed as the percentage inhibition (%) and the IC
 <sub>50</sub>.
