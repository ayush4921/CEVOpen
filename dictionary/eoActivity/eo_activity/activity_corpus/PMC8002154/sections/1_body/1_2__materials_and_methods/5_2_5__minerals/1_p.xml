<p>All samples were digested using a MARS6 microwave digester (CEM Corporation, Charlotte, NC, USA). The digested solutions were then filtered using 0.22 Î¼m membranes. The filtrate was subsequently analyzed using an inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometer (Prodigy7; Teledyne Leeman Labs, Mason, OH, USA). The response signals were tracked at 766.49 nm (K), 589.59 nm (Na), 324.75 nm (Cu), 317.93 nm (Ca), 279.55 nm (Mg), 259.94 nm (Fe), 257.61 nm (Mn), and 206.20 nm (Zn). Each element was quantitatively analyzed in accordance with its standard calibrated curves. </p>
