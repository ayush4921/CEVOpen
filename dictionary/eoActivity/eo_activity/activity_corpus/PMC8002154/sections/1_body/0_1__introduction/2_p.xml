 <italic>Oenothera biennis</italic> (OB), commonly known as evening primrose, is an herbaceous plant of the family

 <xref rid="B9-foods-10-00538" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In recent decades, oil extracted from the seeds of OB (SOB) has drawn attention because of its high polyunsaturated fatty acid content (γ-linolenic acid) and excellent bioactive properties [

 <xref rid="B11-foods-10-00538" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The annual global production of SOB has increased 20-fold in the last 20 years, producing kilotons of seeds annually, and is expected to experience robust growth in the foreseeable future [
 <xref rid="B12-foods-10-00538" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, 50–55% of SOB generated after EPO manufacture are residues (defatted SOB (DSOB)), resulting in a large waste of resources. The disposal of DSOB seed residues generated by oil extraction is an important issue for related industries, and its use may lead to great economic and environmental benefits, if utilized properly.
