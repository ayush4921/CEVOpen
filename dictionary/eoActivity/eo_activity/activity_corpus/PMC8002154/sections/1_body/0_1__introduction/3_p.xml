<p>SOB is a rich source of not only a valuable oil, containing essential fatty acids, but also of polyphenols, which have shown remarkable bioactivity [

 <xref rid="B14-foods-10-00538" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, to date, few studies have evaluated the nutritional value and polyphenol composition of DSOB, nor the biological properties related to diabetes, which limits the potential reuse of DSOB. In this study, to evaluate the potential of DSOB as a functional food ingredient in diabetes, we investigated the inhibitory effects of DSOB on α-glucosidase and aldose reductase for the first time, and evaluated the antioxidant capacities of DSOB by electron transfer assays (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS)) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging assays (hydroxyl radical (HO•), nitric oxide (NO), and peroxynitrite (ONOO
 <sup>−</sup>)). Moreover, the polyphenol composition and nutritional value of DSOB were analyzed compared to SOB as a reference.
