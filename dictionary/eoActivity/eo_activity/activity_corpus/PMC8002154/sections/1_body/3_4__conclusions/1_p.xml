<p>In summary, DSOB was found to be a reservoir of nutrients and polyphenols, and had remarkable inhibitory activity for α-glucosidase and aldose reductase, as well as antioxidant capacities. Moreover, 25 compounds in DSOB were temporarily identified using LC–ESI–QTOF/MS analysis, which were associated with the remarkable bioactivities of DSOB. DSOB also contained a high content of carbohydrates, proteins, and minerals. The fat content in DSOB decreased after EPO extraction from SOB, resulting in low levels of γ-tocopherol and energy. DSOB contained large amounts of fiber and low levels of sugars, providing a low glycemic index. Notably, DSOB was a good source of Ca and Fe, and the anti-nutrient and oxalic acid content was low. These findings imply that DSOB, that is, the waste material generated by SOB after EPO extraction, has potential as a functional food ingredient in diabetes. </p>
