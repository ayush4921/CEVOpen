 <p>The defatted seeds of 
  <italic>Oenothera biennis</italic> (DSOB) are a by-product of evening primrose oil production that are currently not effectively used. In this study, α-glucosidase inhibition, aldose reductase inhibition, antioxidant capacity, polyphenol composition, and nutritional value (carbohydrates, proteins, minerals, fat, organic acid, and tocopherols) of DSOB were evaluated using the seeds of 
  <italic>Oenothera biennis</italic> (SOB) as a reference. DSOB was an excellent inhibitor of α-glucosidase (IC
  <sub>50</sub> = 3.31 μg/mL) and aldose reductase (IC
  <sub>50</sub> = 2.56 μg/mL). DSOB also showed considerable antioxidant capacities (scavenging of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl, 2,2’-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid, nitric oxide, peroxynitrite, and hydroxyl radicals). DSOB was a reservoir of polyphenols, and 25 compounds in DSOB were temporarily identified by liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization–quadrupole time of flight–mass spectrometry analysis. Moreover, the carbohydrate, protein, and mineral content of DSOB were increased compared to that of SOB. DSOB contained large amounts of fiber and low levels of sugars, and was rich in calcium and iron. These results imply that DSOB may be a potential functional food ingredient for diabetes, providing excellent economic and environmental benefits.
