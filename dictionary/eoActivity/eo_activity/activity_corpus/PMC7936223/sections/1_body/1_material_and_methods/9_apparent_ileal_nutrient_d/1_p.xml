<p id="p0075">To determine the AID of nutrients, the digesta were collected from the lower half of the ileum, as described by 
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Ravindran et al. (2005)</xref>. The ileum was considered as the portion of the small intestine from Meckel's diverticulum to a point about ∼40 mm proximal to the ileocecal junction. The ileal digesta of all birds within each pen was pooled, immediately frozen (–20°C), and stored until further analysis (dry matter [
 <bold>DM</bold>], CP, EE, and organic matter [
 <bold>OM</bold>]). At the time of analysis, ileal digesta collected were dried at 65°C for at least 24 h prior to being ground in a coffee grinder. After that, the amount of DM (method 934.01), CP (method 955.04), EE (method 920.39), and OM (method 942.05) were determined in the diet and digesta samples according to methods of 
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">AOAC (2000)</xref>. The concentration of chromium in the diet and digesta samples were determined by spectrophotometry (450 nm; Spark 10 M; Tecan Group Ltd., Mannedorf, Switzerland), following wet-ash digestion with perchloric and nitric acid (
