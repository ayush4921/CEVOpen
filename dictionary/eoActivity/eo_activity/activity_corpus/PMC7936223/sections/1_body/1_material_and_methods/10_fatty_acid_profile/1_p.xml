<p id="p0085">The thigh muscle specimens were evaluated for fatty acid analysis. Fatty acid methyl esters from tissue total lipid extracts were prepared by acid-catalyzed transesterification of total lipids, similar to the method of 
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Christie (1982)</xref> except that the reaction was performed at 80°C for 3 h. The fatty acid methyl esters were prepared by reaction with 4% HCl in methanol for 20 min at 60°C. Then, analyses of fatty acid methyl esters was determined with a Hewlett-Packard 5890 gas chromatograph equipped with an autosampler, a flame ionization detector, and fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d; Chrompack, Middelburg, The Netherlands). Each sample (1 μL) was injected with helium as a carrier gas onto the column programmed for ramped oven temperatures (initial temperature was 110°C, held for 1 min, then ramped at 150°C/min to 190°C and held for 55 min, then ramped at 5°C/min to 230°C and held for 5 min). Inlet and detector temperatures were both 220°C. Fatty acid methyl esters identification was carried out by comparison of their retention times with the authentic external standards and were expressed as a percentage of fatty acid methyl esters or as g/100 g of sample (
