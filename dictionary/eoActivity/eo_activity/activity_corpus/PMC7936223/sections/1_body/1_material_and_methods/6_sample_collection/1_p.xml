<p id="p0060">At the end of the experiment (day 42), 3 birds from each replicate were randomly selected and sampled. To evaluate serum indices, 5 mL blood samples were obtained from the wing vein, and then serum from each sample was collected by centrifugation at 2,000 × 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4°C. Next, serum samples were frozen at −20°C in Eppendorf tubes for further analysis. After blood sampling, the aforementioned 3 birds were individually weighed and then killed by cervical dislocation to measure the weight of the carcass, breast, thighs, abdominal fat, heart, liver, spleen, pancreas, and bursa of Fabricius. The relative weight of the organs was expressed as a percentage of body weight. After that, digesta samples of the ileum and ceca were collected in sterile tubes to determine the apparent digestibility of nutrients and bacterial enumeration. In addition, the thigh muscle of each bird was removed, vacuum packed, and stored at −20°C for the determination of fatty acid composition.
