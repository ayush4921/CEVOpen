 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Arise et al. (2009)</xref> reported that the administration of aqueous extract of eucalyptus in the feed of rats reduced the cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of serum. In the current study, also serum cholesterol concentration had tended to reduce linearly in birds fed different concentrations of EEO. Similarly,

 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Kladniew et al. (2014)</xref> observed that 1.8-cineole (as the main compound of the eucalyptus) could inhibit steps in cholesterol synthesis by blocking 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl-CoA reductase (the key indicator of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway) levels. In vivo experiments also have shown that the possible mechanism for lowering the cholesterol synthesis by phytogenic products (ajwain, clove, and cinnamon essential oils) may be because of the inhibitory effects of its active compounds on the reductase enzyme 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl-CoA or increased catabolism of lipoproteins (
