<p id="p0145">Oxidative stress is a common process in life, which means the imbalance between the production of free radicals and the body's antioxidant system's ability to remove these reactive species (
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Birben et al., 2012</xref>). The SOD and GSH-Px enzymes are the most important antioxidant defense enzymes protecting cells by preventing the formation of free radicals and increasing the antioxidant defense (
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Mohebodini et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, lipid peroxidation is a major consequence of oxidative stress, leading to increased MDA contents. Therefore, MDA concentration is usually used as a biomarker to assess the extent of lipid oxidation (
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Shirani et al., 2019</xref>). Our findings indicated the dietary supplementation of EEO enhanced the serum antioxidant capacity of broiler chickens by increasing the activity of SOD and reducing MDA content. This means that the EEO may provide a more efficient free radical-scavenging activity in broiler chickens. There are almost no data about the antioxidant effects of EEO in broiler chickens, but there is evidence of antioxidant effects from in vitro studies. A study by 
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Luis et al. (2016)</xref> examined the antioxidant activity of EEO by test systems of antioxidant activity such as DPPH. In that study, the researchers stated that EEO could be considered as potential substitutes of synthetics ones, considering their radical scavenging properties and lipid peroxidation inhibition capacity (
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Luis et al., 2016</xref>). These authors ascribed the observed antioxidant properties to 1.8 cineole. 
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Horvathova et al. (2014)</xref> also observed that 1.8 cineole exhibited different degrees of reducing power, radical scavenging, chelating, in addition to DNA-protective capacity. The exact mechanism by which EEO and essential oils improve antioxidant capacity is not fully understood. However, the possible mechanism of aromatic plants or their essential oils for this observation may be attributed to their ability to donate hydrogens or electrons and also delocalizing the unpaired electron within the aromatic structure (
