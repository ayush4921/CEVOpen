<p id="p0155">In summary, the findings obtained in this study indicated that supplementation with increasing levels of EEO improved growth performance, enhanced the AID of OM and EE, modified the cecal microbial population, and improved the antioxidant status of broiler chickens. In addition, dietary EEO supplementation can positively affect fatty acid compositions in the thigh muscle. Among the 4 dosages of EEO, the addition of 1,000Â mg/kg EEO had the best performing in broiler chickens. However, further research is warranted to validate these results in the enteric disease challenge model or commercial farm conditions.</p>
