<p id="p0115">Concentrations of glucose, total protein, triglycerides, and high-density lipoproteins were not affected by dietary treatments in this experiment (
 <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). However, a trend of linear (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.074) reduction in cholesterol was observed as the dietary EEO supplementation increased. Furthermore, no significant difference was recorded among the treatment groups for GSH-Px activity, whereas the activity of SOD was increased linearly as the dietary levels of EEO increased (
