  <p>Scheme representing the diverse factors (natural, on the left, and artificial, on the right part) that can modulate specialized metabolites in plants: abiotic stresses as drought, salt, UV radiation and temperature; microorganisms (i.e., biotic factors) such as plant growth-promoting bacteria—PGPB and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi—AMF; in vitro systems; advanced breeding techniques based on trans/cis-genesis, genome editing and -omics approaches.</p>
