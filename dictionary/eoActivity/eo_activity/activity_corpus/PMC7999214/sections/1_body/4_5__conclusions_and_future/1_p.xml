<p>Even if not exhaustive, due to the increasing interest of the scientists on SMs, the examined literature supports the hypothesis that the biosynthesis of plant secondary metabolites (also called specialized metabolites) in many Mediterranean crops is stimulated by various environmental constraints (salinity, drought, temperature, etc.) and that these compounds play a significant role in plant adaptation to environmental stresses. The interactions with other organisms, such as soil fungi and bacteria, can also lead to a different accumulation of diverse SM classes both at local and systemic level (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-02887-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Most of SM properties are associated with their functional groups exerting an antioxidant activity against oxidative damage that is usually the result of excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to environmental stress. It is also documented in the literature that plant SMs are important candidates for human nutrition. Biotic and abiotic factors that influence production of plant SMs should be further investigated with the aim to set up crop management strategies to improve the potential of plants for SM production in open fields or in confined environments and thus their nutritional quality. Environmental stresses experienced by many important crops in the Mediterranean environment may constitute not only a constraint for their production but also a tool for their exploitation and for improving the synthesis of different SMs of interest in vitro as well in vivo.
