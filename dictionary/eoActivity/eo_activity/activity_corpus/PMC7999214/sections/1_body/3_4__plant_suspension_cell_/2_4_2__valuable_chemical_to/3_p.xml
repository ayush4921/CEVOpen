<p>Similar to other chemical elicitors, SA and salicylates are used less than jasmonates for elicitation studies in plant cell cultures. These molecules may also act through modulation of biosynthetic enzymes, such as phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) [
