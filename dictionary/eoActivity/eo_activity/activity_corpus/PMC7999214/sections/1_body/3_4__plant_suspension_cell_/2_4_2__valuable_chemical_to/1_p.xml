<p>Plants exhibit a wide array of constitutive and inducible defense strategies against biotic and abiotic stresses. Defense responses in plants are generally triggered by elicitors which act as chemical signals. In plant cell cultures, the exogenous supply of chemical elicitors including cellular signaling compounds such as jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), ethylene (ET), nitric oxide (NO) or synthetic chemicals mirrors an under-stress environment. The objective of adding elicitors to in vitro cultures is to misguide the cells for a possible biotic/abiotic attack, mimicking the external environment like natural conditions under stress [

 <xref rid="B230-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">230</xref>]. By the application of elicitors, both qualitative and quantitative modulations in the content of specialized metabolites can be obtained. Chemical elicitors such as JA, methyl jasmonate (MeJA), 2-hydroxyl ethyl jasmonate, SA, acetyl salicylic acid (ASA), trifluro ethyl salicylic acid, ET, NO, sodium nitropruside (SNP), ethrel or ethephon (Ethe), cyclodextrins (CD) and many more have been employed for secondary metabolite in vitro manipulation [
