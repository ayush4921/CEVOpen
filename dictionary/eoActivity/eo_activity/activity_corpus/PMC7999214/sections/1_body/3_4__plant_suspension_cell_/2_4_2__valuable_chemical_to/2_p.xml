<p>JA and its related signal molecules such as MeJA were extensively used for elicitation studies involving plant cell cultures (

Keeping in view the enormous literature on the use of jasmonates in elicitation studies, a few latest examples were cited herein involving plant suspension cell cultures. The concentration of elicitors could be vital irrespective of different plant species used for elicitation experiments. Different studies indicated concentration of jasmonates ranging from 5.0 to 500 µM for different plant culture systems, with concentration of 100 µM MeJA being used in most experiments involving several plants and culture systems (
