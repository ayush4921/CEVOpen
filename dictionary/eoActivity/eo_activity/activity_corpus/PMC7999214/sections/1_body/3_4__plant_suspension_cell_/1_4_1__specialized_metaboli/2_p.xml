<p>It is also known that many metabolites are present in plant tissues at very low concentrations, and the availability of a controlled production system such as suspension cell cultures producing specific phytochemicals is far desirable. The very important advantages of in vitro plant cultured cells are the fast growth and the ability to accumulate large amounts of uniform biomass in a short time period [

 <xref rid="B219-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">219</xref>]. This is especially true to produce rare bioactive compounds, which in plants are usually found in low amounts, such as resveratrol, paclitaxel or terpenoids, whose isolation and purification requires the processing of large quantities of plant biomass [

Moreover, plant cultured cells offer a reliable and powerful production platform for continuous supply of contamination-free, phytochemically uniform biomass of diverse plant species such as aromatic, medicinal and even rare and threatened plants. The opportunity to obtain natural molecules by using an environmentally sustainable biosynthetic platform made plant cell culture technology exceptionally attractive for the production of active ingredients for high added value “green” cosmetic formulations [
