<p>ET is not a widespread chemical elicitor used for SMs yield enhancement due its positive as well as negative effects and its utilization as an elicitor is much more of academic than practical importance. Combined treatment of ET with other elicitors was found beneficial for enhanced production of SMs indicating its interactive role. Indeed, it was found that, independently of the use of elicitors alone or in combinations, the cell culture system was also critical in determining helpful effects on accumulation of metabolites (i.e., alkaloids).</p>
