<p>Plant cultured cells are usually obtained by inducing dedifferentiation of already differentiated cells from adult specialized tissues. Because of their origin from differentiated cells, they could inherit some epigenetic modifications, characteristic of the tissues of origin, and thus, they could be very heterogeneous in their biosynthetic and growth properties. This evidence made it possible to generate almost unlimited numbers of plant cell lines with unique phytochemical profiles and growth characteristics even from the same plant of origin. On the other hand, epigenetic changes can also occur during in vitro maintenance, likely being the reason for the yield variations, sometimes observed in selected highly producing cell lines. Such instability may be a limitation that should be considered while using plant cultured cells as bio-factories of specific phytochemicals [
