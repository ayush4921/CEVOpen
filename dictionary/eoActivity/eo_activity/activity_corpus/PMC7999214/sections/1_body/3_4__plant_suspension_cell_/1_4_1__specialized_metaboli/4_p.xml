<p>As previously stated, many phytochemicals, especially terpenoids, are biosynthesized in plants in specialized structures such as glandular trichomes [
 <xref rid="B225-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">225</xref>]; nevertheless, in vitro cell cultures have the capacity of synthesizing such compounds. This is the case of the sesquiterpene lactone artemisinin produced by suspension cell cultures of

 <xref rid="B227-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">227</xref>]. This feature can be very useful to optimize an in vitro production system since it is easier to recover the desired compounds from the spent culture medium.
