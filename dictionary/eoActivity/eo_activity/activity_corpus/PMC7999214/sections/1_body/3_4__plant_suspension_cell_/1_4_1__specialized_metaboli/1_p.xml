<p>Plant cell culture is a technology for cultivating cells and tissues under strictly controlled environmental conditions. Plant cultured cells, being undifferentiated, have the potential to express the full genetic machinery coded in the nucleus and thus are considered totipotent. Nevertheless, they are able to produce SMs, characteristic of original plants. Cultured cells, as callus or suspension, of many plant species have been established starting from differentiated tissues, such as leaves, stems or roots and proved to produce specific metabolites in axenic conditions. Particularly, suspension cell cultures offer the advantage of scaling up using bioreactors, which allow the cultivation of large-scale cell volumes and consequently the controlled production of increased metabolite amounts, independently from environmental conditions such as climate or soil [
