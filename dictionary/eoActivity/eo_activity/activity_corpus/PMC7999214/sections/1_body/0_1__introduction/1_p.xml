<p>Plants are excellent chemists because of their ability to produce an outstandingly wide arsenal of not less than 5000 different metabolites [
 <xref rid="B1-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, the real extension of the diversity of natural compounds is still largely unknown, since only a small portion of the plant world has so far been explored from a chemical point of view. These natural products are volatile, semi-volatile and non-volatile compounds derived from common building blocks produced through primary metabolic pathways, such as amino acids, isoprenoids, nucleotides and sugars [
 <xref rid="B2-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. They have long been considered waste products of the metabolism, and the name “secondary metabolites” derives from the initial observations that, in contrast to primary metabolites, they are not directly involved in growth and reproduction [
 <xref rid="B3-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, they should be more appropriately referred to as specialized metabolites (SMs). Differently from the evolutionary constrained primary metabolites, SMs rapidly evolve in order to allow a better adaptation of plants to environmental cues [
 <xref rid="B4-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In plants, these chemo-diverse molecules add color, taste and odor but can be also toxic to other organisms and deter herbivores and pathogens, protect from UV light, cold and drought [
 <xref rid="B6-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] or be attractive to fascinate pollinators and disperse seeds [
 <xref rid="B7-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. There are three major groups of SMs in plants based on their biosynthetic pathways, i.e., nitrogen-containing compounds (cyanogenic glycosides, alkaloids and glucosinolates), phenolic compounds (phenylpropanoids) and terpenes (isoprenoids) [
 <xref rid="B8-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These few main carbon backbones are further modified through chemical reactions such as glycosylation, acylation, methylation, hydroxylation, prenylation, etc., generating a wealth of phytochemicals with diverse biological properties and interaction capacities. These specific enzymatic decorations generally occur in phylogenetically restricted groups of plant species, in particular developmental stages, in specific tissues or cell types or following favorable or unpleasant interactions [
 <xref rid="B9-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. As an example of such specialization, tropane alkaloids are biosynthesized in roots to be then translocated to leaves, as in the Solanaceae, or biosynthesized and accumulated in leaves, as in the Erythroxylaceae [
 <xref rid="B11-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Roots can also produce specialized molecules such as benzoxazinoids, naphthoquinones and strigolactones, which are secreted in the environment and are responsible for important allelopathic interactions. SMs are considered essential for the defense of plants from biotic and abiotic stresses [
 <xref rid="B12-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], often exacerbated by global climate change [
 <xref rid="B14-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Climate change involves a general rise of atmospheric CO
 <sub>2</sub>, temperature and drought, even in those regions classified as sub-humid up to a few decades ago. Under such stressing environmental conditions, plants adjust their metabolism towards an energy-costly production of SMs, in order to improve their acclimation and survival strategies [
 <xref rid="B15-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Besides their role in plant physiology, SMs are also of outstanding interest for other reasons. Humans have in fact benefitted from SMs in agriculture, medicine, production of flavors and perfumes, etc. Most of the SMs present in plants, especially in fruits, have antioxidant effects; therefore, their consumption in foods may contribute to human health, since they provide protection against the constant formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which are powerful oxidants [
 <xref rid="B17-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Pharmaceutical organic chemists have been long investigating the chemical properties of these phytochemicals, for their potential application as fibers, oils, flavoring agents, dyes and drugs, as well as antibiotics and agrochemical substitutes. Indeed, most of these molecules are produced in plants for their strong anti-herbivore activity, as well as protection against pathogens and competing plant species, having a high potential as bio-pesticides and herbicides [
