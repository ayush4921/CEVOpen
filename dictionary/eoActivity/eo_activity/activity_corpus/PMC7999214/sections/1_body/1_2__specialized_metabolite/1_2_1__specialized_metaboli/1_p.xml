<p>In Mediterranean regions, plants are exposed to multiple interacting environmental stressors such as drought, heat, salinity and excess UV radiation. Environmental stress factors can weaken important physiological functions of the plant and severely affect crop yields. Under these stressful conditions, plants address their metabolism and gene expression towards physiological and morphological adaptation and the biosynthesis of defensive SMs rather than nitrogen-based compounds. This â€œmetabolic plasticity is costly, as fresh assimilated carbon and energy are diverted from growth but may represent a key determinant for the survival of plants in harsh environments, such as diverse regions in the Mediterranean area. Overall, factors that determine alterations in SMs are mainly environmental and genetic. Among them, environmental factors are the key determinants for the fluctuations in plant SMs [

 <xref rid="B21-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. These results, however, may be also indirectly connected to environmental conditions, since in the past the selection pressure was addressed more to plant adaptability to environmental stresses than to high productivity as in modern cultivars. A detailed but not exhaustive overview on the effects of some main environmental stresses on SM induction in some important Mediterranean crops are thereafter discussed.
