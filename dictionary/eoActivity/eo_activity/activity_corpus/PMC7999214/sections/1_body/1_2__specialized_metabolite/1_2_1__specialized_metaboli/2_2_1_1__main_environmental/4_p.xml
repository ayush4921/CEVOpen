 <italic>Brassica napus</italic>, 
 <italic>Lactuca sativa</italic>, 
 <italic>Cucumis sativus</italic>, 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> and many medicinal plants [

 <xref rid="B28-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In grapevine and 
 <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>, the concentration in phenolic compounds markedly increased in plants subjected to drought stress. In maize and in triticale, under polyethylene-glycol induced stress, the accumulation of ferulic acid and total phenolics was observed in drought-tolerant genotypes. Thus, in these species, the accumulation of phenolics and ferulic acid could be used as a selection criterion to screen plants for drought resistance [
