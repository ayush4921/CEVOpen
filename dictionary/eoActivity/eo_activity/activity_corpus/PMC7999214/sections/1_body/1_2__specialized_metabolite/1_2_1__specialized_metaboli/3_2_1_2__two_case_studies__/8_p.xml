<p>In detail, as concerns the effect of water limitation, it triggered the biosynthesis of phenolic compounds, suggesting the possible antioxidant roles of phenolics in the leaves. Relevant increases in flavanols in the leaves, according to the genotype (Kilis Yağlık), the lack of irrigation and the developmental stages of olive, have been ascertained. The authors hypothesize that the increase in leaf biosynthesis of flavonoids in summer could be related to their role in the protection against stress induced by UV irradiations. In fact, the flavonoid functions against UV irradiation stress have been well documented [
