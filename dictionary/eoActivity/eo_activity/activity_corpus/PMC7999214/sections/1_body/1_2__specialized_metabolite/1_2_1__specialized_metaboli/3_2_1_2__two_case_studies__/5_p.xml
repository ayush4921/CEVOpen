 <xref rid="B37-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] explained an increase in ascorbic acid content in tomato under salinity stress with a de novo synthesis beside an enhanced ascorbate recycling via recycling enzymes coupled with the reducing compound dihydrolipoic acid. A stimulating effect of different environmental stresses has been demonstrated also on tocopherol (vitamin E) content of tomato fruits [
