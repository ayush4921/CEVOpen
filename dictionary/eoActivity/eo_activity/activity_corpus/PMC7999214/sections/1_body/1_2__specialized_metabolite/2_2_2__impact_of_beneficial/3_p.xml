<p>Already in 2013, Lingua and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B52-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] showed that inoculation with AMF and/or with selected 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strains increased anthocyanin concentration in strawberry (
 <italic>Fragaria</italic> Ã— 
 <italic>ananassa</italic> var. Selva) fruits under conditions of reduced fertilization. An increase in strawberry fruit anthocyanin content has been also reported after inoculation with AMF communities from soils collected in reference-sites in the cultivation of this species [
 <xref rid="B60-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. A higher concentration of sugars and ascorbic and folic acid in comparison with fruits of non-inoculated plants has been also reported after an inoculation with a mixed inoculum containing both AMF and two PGPB strains [
