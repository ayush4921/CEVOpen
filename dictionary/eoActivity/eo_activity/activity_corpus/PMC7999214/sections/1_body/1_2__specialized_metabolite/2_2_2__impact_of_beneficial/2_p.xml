<p>In the last ten years, several research groups focused the attention to evaluate the impact of AMF on the SM production in different horticultural crop species as well as in aromatic and medicinal plants. Although a positive impact on both yield and quality has been found [

In this paragraph, some examples of these researches have been reported, with the aim to underline the importance of the AM symbiosis in the cultivation of these plant species.
