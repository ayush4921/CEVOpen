<p>Production and accumulation of SMs often occur when plants are subjected to various stresses, elicitors or signal molecules [
 <xref rid="B43-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Some major biotic elicitors with a role in the production of SMs in plants are arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) [
 <xref rid="B44-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="B45-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The use of AMF during cultivation is a promising possibility to increase biomass and essential oil yield of medicinal, spicy, aromatic plants through less aggressive agronomic practices that stimulate plant growth, without compromising the quality of the merchandised product. The application of AMF in these cultivations has been already reported to improve plant growth and development as well as the tolerance to abiotic and biotic stressors [
 <xref rid="B46-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,
 <xref rid="B47-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="B48-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. It is already known that AMF can influence the plant specialized metabolic pathways [
 <xref rid="B49-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], and there is some evidence that AM fungal colonization increases phenolic content and resistance to oxidative stress in fruit tissues [

 <xref rid="B50-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,
 <xref rid="B51-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,
 <xref rid="B52-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In this context, it has been proposed that AMF, either naturally occurring or inoculated, may be a sustainable approach to alleviate malnutrition and supplementing human health as part of the “second green revolution” [
 <xref rid="B53-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. PGPB can increase plant growth, improving plant nutrition and supporting plant development under natural or stressed conditions. Indeed, beneficial bacterial inoculants may be recognized as a potential threat by the plant and induce the activation of plant defense mechanisms leading to the biosynthesis of resistance compounds [
 <xref rid="B45-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Several studies confirmed that different bacterial species living on and inside the root system are beneficial for plant growth, yield and crop quality, including 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic>, 
 <italic>Azotobacter</italic> and 
 <italic>Azospirillum</italic> spp. capable of inducing SM production in different aromatic plants such as 
 <italic>Salvia officinalis</italic>, 
 <italic>Origanum</italic> × 
 <italic>majoricum</italic>, 
 <italic>Origanum majorana</italic> and 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B45-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In addition, enhanced production of apigenin-7-O-glucoside in chamomile was triggered by a treatment with two bacterial strains such as 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> Co1-6 and 
 <italic>Paenibacillus polymyxa</italic> Mc5Re-14 [
 <xref rid="B54-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], while 
 <italic>Chaetomium globosum</italic> D38 promoted bioactive constituent accumulation and root production in 
 <italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic>, increasing the content in tanshinones, a molecule recently utilized in the treatment of several cardiovascular diseases [
