<p>Patanè et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], working on long-shelf-life tomato landraces cultivated in both greenhouse and open field conditions in Southern Italy, reported a more pronounced accumulation of phenolics in open field fruits, as a result of fruit exposition to solar UV radiation and high temperatures (up to 32 °C) during ripening. The authors explained the lower phenolic content in greenhouse fruits as a possible result of UV-exclusion under PVC cover and low temperatures occurring in late wintertime inside the unheated greenhouse. Similar promoting effects of high levels of irradiance in open fields were reported by the same authors on ascorbate accumulation in tomato fruits (up to +65%). An increase of phenolics in tomatoes grown under temperatures approaching 35 °C was also observed by Rivero et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], as a mechanism of adaptation against heat stress. These authors explained this result as an activation of the enzyme PAL under high temperatures, which induces a rise in phenolic content of fruits [
