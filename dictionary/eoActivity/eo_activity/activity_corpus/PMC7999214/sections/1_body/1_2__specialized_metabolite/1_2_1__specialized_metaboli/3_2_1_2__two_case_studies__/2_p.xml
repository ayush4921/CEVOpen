<p>Interestingly, there is evidence that tomato fruits produced in Mediterranean areas are richer in phenols than those produced in Northern Europe [

 <xref rid="B32-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], working on some local Mediterranean landraces of long shelf-life tomato cultivated in a typical semi-arid environment under no water supply, observed greater contents in total phenols (0.09 to 0.21 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup> of fresh weight), up to ten-fold higher than those measured in the commercial cultivar used as control (&lt;0.030 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup>). The greatest phenol contents in long shelf-life landraces were explained as a result of environmental pressure, which exerted a natural selection towards those types with relevant phenolic biosynthesis, being these landraces traditionally cultivated under no water supply.
