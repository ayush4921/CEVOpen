<p>AMF are naturally associated with grapevines, providing some benefits to the plant, although the effects are dependent on many factors, including variety [

Tempranillo, which is cultivated for its wine of high quality, with AMF led to a modification in the profile of metabolites in Tempranillo berries, especially those of the primary compounds. The levels of glucose and amino acids clearly increased in berries, which may affect the aromatic characteristics of wines, while the total amount and the profiles of anthocyanins and flavonols have not been strongly affected by the AM symbiosis [

 <xref rid="B69-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] evaluated the fruit quality of eight old grapevine varieties recovered in Navarre (northeastern of the Iberian Peninsula), colonized or not with AMFs. In some varieties, AM symbiosis improved berry traits by enhancing the concentrations of soluble solids and anthocyanins. In others, berry color, total phenolic and anthocyanin content decreased in inoculated plants, suggesting that intraspecific diversity of old grapevines could include a different capacity to respond to AM symbiosis.
