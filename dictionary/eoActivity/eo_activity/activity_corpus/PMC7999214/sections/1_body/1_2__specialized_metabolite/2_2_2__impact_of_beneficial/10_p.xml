<p>Results so far obtained suggested that inoculation of plant species could represent a suitable tool to obtain higher amounts of metabolites for pharmaceutical and medicinal purposes, both using AMF and PGPB [

In addition, although studies focused on the accumulation of SMs in inoculated plants have been intensified over the last decade, the mechanisms through which root-associated microorganisms can alter the production of SMs are not fully clarified yet.
