<p>As concerns salinity, changes in phenolic compounds of 
 <italic>O. europaea</italic> cultivars contrasting in salt tolerance, have been reported. Phenolic content in new leaves of salt-sensitive cultivars remained stable at increasing salinity levels whereas salt-tolerant cultivars exhibited greater phenolic contents, which raised with the increase in salt stress in new and old leaves. Within the quantified phenolic compounds, oleuropein was reported to be the major compound in both leaves and roots, suggesting the possible protective role against salt stress [
