<p>Looking at the plant as an holobiont, attention has been also dedicated to evaluating the role of endophytic fungi in alterations of metabolite production and amounts of active compounds in medicinal plants. In addition, endophytic microbial communities associated with medicinal plants have a great potential as producers of bioactive compounds for agricultural, pharmaceutical, and other industrial applications [

 <italic>Salvia abrotanoides</italic> originated from three geographically distinct sites in Iran have been evaluated. Extracts from mycelia of these isolates revealed a wide spectrum of SMs, demonstrating that some of them (e.g., 
 <italic>Penicillium canescens</italic>, 
 <italic>P. murcianum</italic>, 
 <italic>Paraphoma radicina</italic> and 
 <italic>Coniolariella hispanica</italic>) produce cryptotanshinone, i.e., a main bioactive compound of 
 <italic>S. abrotanoides</italic>, confirming that endophytic fungi play an important role in the production of plant bioactive metabolites [
