<p>Beside genotype and climatic factors, the agronomic management, mostly irrigation, greatly affects the content of SMs in the product. In processing tomatoes cultivated in a typical semi-arid area of Southern Italy, an increased content in ascorbic acid and total phenolics, has been reported in response to moderate or severe water stress conditions [
