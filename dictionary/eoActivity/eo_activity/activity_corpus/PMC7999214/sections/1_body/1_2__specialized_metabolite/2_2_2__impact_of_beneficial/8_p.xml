<p>Recently, it has also been tested a possible synergic effect of AM symbiosis and methyl jasmonate both to improve plant physiological performances under water stress [

 <xref rid="B92-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. In particular, in 
 <italic>Trigonella foenum-graecum</italic> (fenugreek), a leguminous plant frequently used in medicinal preparation for its content in trigonelline and diosgenin, it has been shown that AMF are more effective to stimulate the production of trigonelline, while the combination of methyl jasmonate and root symbiosis resulted a better elicitor for diosgenin production [

Furthermore, a recent study also highlighted a possible positive combined effect of bioregulators application (in this case, exogenous ethylene application by ethephon treatments) and AM symbiosis in stimulating trigonelline production in fenugreek [

 <xref rid="B94-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>], showing a stimulation of cannabinoid compound concentrations and an antagonistic activity against invading pathogens and contaminating mycotoxigenic fungi [
