It was suggested that thermal stress induced the production of phenolics and thereby led to thermal tolerance in plants. In sorghum, authors correlated the rich phenolic profile of the dark seeded genotypes with greater temperature tolerance. It was also ascertained a marked variation in the response of plant species to different temperature ranges. Low temperature also caused a conspicuous decrease in the biosynthesis and storage of SMs [

 <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic>, it was proposed that tolerant varieties possess higher reducing power, antioxidant activity and phenolic contents. In this species, cold stress also resulted in a marked decrease in the concentration of phenolics (ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, and particularly caffeic acid derivatives) and antioxidant activity. A similar decrease was reported for rosmarinic acid content in spearmint under heat stress [
