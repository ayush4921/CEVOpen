<p>The quantity and quality of the SMs in olive parts are not stable. In short, multivariate interactions of endogenous (cultivar, plant age, crop developmental stage and alternate bearing phenomenon) and exogenous factors (water and salinity stress, environment, agricultural practices, etc.) are predictive factors of the amount of phenols present in olive leaves, fruits and oil [

 <xref rid="B41-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] suggested that the optimal harvest time for each olive variety permits to obtain the highest phenolic content in oil. In fact, increased quantities of phenolic compounds have been recorded from the green to the spotted stages of maturation, and then, they decrease until maturity.
