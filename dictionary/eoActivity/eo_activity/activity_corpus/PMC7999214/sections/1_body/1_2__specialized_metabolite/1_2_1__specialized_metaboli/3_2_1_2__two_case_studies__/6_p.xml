<p>Olive (
 <italic>Olea europaea</italic> L.) has been exploited for the polyphenolic content of its fruits and oil; however, a high and rich content of polyphenols has been recently recognized also in olive leaves by Kulak and Cetinkaya [
 <xref rid="B39-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This high content in polyphenols confers resistance against abiotic and biotic stressors. This raw material is actually being studied as a source of useful bioactive compounds with antioxidants (mainly due to oleuropein), antimicrobial and human health properties [
 <xref rid="B40-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In the Mediterranean region, olive is the prevalent crop as a source of oil. Olive oil includes high amounts of SMs, namely, Î±-tocopherol, oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric, vanillic acid, apigenin, luteolin, pinoresinol, 1-acetoxypinoresinol, oleocanthal and oleacein, most of which are phenolic compounds. The quality and subsequently aromatic value or bio-efficacy of the oil or olive fruits have been well documented to be related to the content and pattern of phenolic compounds of the fruit.
