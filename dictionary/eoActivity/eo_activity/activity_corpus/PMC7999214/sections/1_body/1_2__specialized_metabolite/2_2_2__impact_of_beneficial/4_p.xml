Overall, the interaction of tomato plants with AMF enhances the nutritional quality by increasing the contents of citric acid, carotenoids and certain amino acids as well as the antioxidant capacity of the fruits. In one of the first work dedicated to verifying the impact of arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) symbiosis on tomato fruits, Giovannetti et al. [
 <xref rid="B63-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] showed that the AM symbiosis, in addition to positively affecting the tomato plant growth and mineral nutrient content, also enhanced the nutritional and nutraceutical value of tomato fruits by modifications of plant specialized metabolism that led to increased levels of lycopene in fruits from AM-colonized plants with respect to control ones. An AMF-mediated increase in lycopene content of tomato fruits has been also observed in a recent study [
 <xref rid="B66-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] focused on cherry tomato landraces belonging to the Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) “Pomodorino del Piennolo del Vesuvio” (PPV), which represents one of the most typical agricultural products of the Campania region (Southern Italy). Focusing on both the yellow-pigmented type (“Giagiù”) and red-pigmented type (“Lucariello”) tomatoes, it was shown that AMF inoculation positively influenced the content of molecules with a role in both human health and shelf life of tomato fruits, with a genotype-specific response. A significant increase in lycopene, total ascorbic acid (TAA), alanine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) has been in fact found in “Lucariello” local variety, as well as an increase in calcium, zinc, ASP, GABA and the essential amino acids arginine and lysine in “Giagiù” genotype. Schubert et al. [
 <xref rid="B59-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] focused instead on fruit gene expression and metabolite levels in industrialized tomatoes whose production faces a decrease in flavors and nutritional value due to conventional breeding. It is worth noting that red fruits from mycorrhizal plants showed an increased level of carotenoids in comparison to those from non-mycorrhizal plants, although an effect on yield was not observed. The effect was also reported by Hart et al. [
 <xref rid="B64-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] on a different tomato cultivar, suggesting both a direct upregulation of the carotenoid pathway due to lower carbohydrate levels and an indirect upregulation of this pathway by acting on the root hormonal levels (e.g., stimulating ABA biosynthesis that shares the same metabolic pathway of carotenoids). These authors also showed an increase in volatile organic compounds (VOCs) derived from phenylalanine in the fruits of inoculated tomatoes with five volatile compounds that were significantly higher in AM-plants compared with non-AM controls [
 <xref rid="B64-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Since phenylalanine is a key precursor of the phenylpropanoid pathway, which produces several antioxidant molecules such as flavonols and caffeic acid derivatives, further studies on AMF inoculation on tomatoes cultivars could be important to investigate the antioxidant potential of the fruits.
