<p>In the last years, several studies have been dedicated to verifying the impact of inoculation with AMF on aromatic [

 <xref rid="B73-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] and medicinal plants [
 <xref rid="B74-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,
 <xref rid="B75-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>], mainly focusing on the impact of AMF on phenols and essential oils. In 
 <italic>Melissa officinalis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B76-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], the highest essential oil contents were observed in treatments with AMF and manure, and inoculation with AMF—without/with organic fertilizer—had positive influence on the content of citral (geranial + neral), phenols and flavonoids; in 
 <italic>Artemisia dracunculus</italic> (tarragon), 
 <italic>Lavandula angustifolia</italic> (lavender) and 
 <italic>Hyssopus officinalis</italic> (hyssop) [
 <xref rid="B77-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], AMF stimulated a significant increase in essential oil content in the three species. The potential role of AM symbiosis to improve the SMs content has attained enormous recognition for sustainable cultivation of medicinally important crops [
 <xref rid="B78-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. AMF-plant symbiosis not only improves the growth and nutrients but also exerts a synergistic effect on accumulation of bioactive compounds with medicinal importance. In chamomile (
 <italic>Matricaria recutita</italic> L.) most of the identified phenolic compounds, except apigenin, occurred in larger quantities in AM-inoculated plants, differently from that observed after inoculation with bacterial strains [
 <xref rid="B54-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. However, no differences between inoculated and non-inoculated plants were observed in the content and composition of essential oil, whose dominant compounds were α-bisabolol, chamazulene, and β-farnesene [
 <xref rid="B79-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Another study on the same plant species showed that the presence of AMF in the soil is the most influential variable in the production of capitula and essential oil of chamomile, but subtle differences on soil pH influenced these parameters [
 <xref rid="B80-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Positive effects have been also reported in the coarse mint (
 <italic>Plectranthus amboinicus</italic> Lour.), which is a medicinal plant that produces essential oil [
 <xref rid="B81-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>], and in 
 <italic>Bituminaria bituminosa,</italic> which is considered a source of different phytochemicals with an importance for industrial purposes, i.e., furanocoumarins and pterocarpans that are used in cosmetics and as chemotherapeutic agents. Pistelli et al. [
 <xref rid="B82-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] have recently demonstrated that AM-inoculated leaves of 
 <italic>B. bituminosa</italic> had a high amount of furanocoumarins (angelicin and psoralen) and pterocarpans (erybraedin C and bitucarpin A), important compounds for their anticancer properties [
 <xref rid="B83-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>,
 <xref rid="B84-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Furthermore, in the same study, the analysis of VOCs of inoculated plants showed different chemical composition compared with non-mycorrhizal plants, supporting previous results which suggested a positive effect of mycorrhizal symbiosis on terpenoid yield [
 <xref rid="B85-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. As for other aspects related to AMF colonization [
 <xref rid="B86-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>,
 <xref rid="B87-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>], the increase in SM production can change depending on the relationship between the host and the AMF species. Plants of 
 <italic>Cynara cardunculus</italic> L. var. 
 <italic>scolymus</italic> F. accumulated more phenolic compounds and showed a higher antioxidant activity when inoculated with 
 <italic>Rhizophagus intraradices</italic> compared to those associated with 
 <italic>Funneliformis mosseae</italic> (formerly 
 <italic>Glomus mosseae</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B88-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] that instead concentrated more rosmarinic and caffeic acid than those colonized with 
 <italic>R. intraradices</italic> [
 <xref rid="B89-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. The latter was also more efficient in enhancing the level of saponins in 
 <italic>Chlorophytum borivilianum</italic> Santapau and Fernandes compared to other two AM fungal species [
 <xref rid="B90-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>].
