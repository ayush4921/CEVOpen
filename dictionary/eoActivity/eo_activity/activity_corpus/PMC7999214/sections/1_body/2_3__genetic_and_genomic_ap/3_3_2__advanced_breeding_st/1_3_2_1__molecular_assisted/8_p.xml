<p>When the candidate genes have been identified, and functionally verified, specific markers can be developed for a more efficient MAB of improved cultivars. For instance, in pepper, marker-assisted selection has been pursued to develop a new fresh pepper cultivar containing capsinoids, low-pungent capsaicinoid analogs. For this purpose, PCR-based markers associated with 
 <italic>p-AMT</italic> and 
 <italic>Pun1</italic> genes were developed and used to obtain a new cultivar with desirable traits [
