<p>When dealing with specialized metabolism, one of the most desired objectives is to redirect the substrates stream by removing competing pathways. A nice example of the use of NBTs for this purpose could be the multiple editing of the squalene synthase (
 <italic>SQS</italic>), β-farnesene synthase (
 <italic>BFS</italic>) and β-caryophyllene synthase (
 <italic>CPS</italic>) genes encoding enzymes at branching points for the synthesis of artemisinin, an antimalarial drug, in 
 <italic>A. annua</italic>. In fact, Lv et al. [
 <xref rid="B179-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">179</xref>] showed that artemisinin increased in anti-SQS, anti-BFS and anti-CPS transgenic plants.
