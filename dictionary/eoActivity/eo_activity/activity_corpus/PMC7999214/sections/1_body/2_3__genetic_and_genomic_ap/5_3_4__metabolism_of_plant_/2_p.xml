<p>Since the first studies on mint secretory glands and the identification of key enzymatic steps in menthol biosynthesis [
 <xref rid="B205-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">205</xref>], scientific interest toward biochemistry of trichomes, as biofactories of valuable molecules, has enormously increased. This has been particularly remarkable in the last ten years, when the emergence of high-throughput sequencing techniques has allowed deepening the knowledge on the genes responsible for metabolic diversity. In parallel, efficient isolation techniques by laser microdissection pressure catapulting (LMPC) [
 <xref rid="B206-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>] have allowed the separation and enrichment of specific cell types, such as multicellular glandular trichomes, thus targeting chemical, transcriptional and biosynthetic characterizations only toward glandular specialized metabolites. The combination of these techniques with advanced mass spectrometry technologies, UPLC-MS/MS, LC-TOF-MS, NMR, or even mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) has allowed direct profiling and imaging of the glandular trichomes metabolism. In particular, imaging studies resulted very useful for detecting shape and development of glandular trichomes in cultivated and wild tomato species [

 <xref rid="B208-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">208</xref>] showed that the wild species 
 <italic>Solanum habrochaites</italic> has trichomes with different shape and higher metabolic capacity than the cultivated 
 <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic>, both characters being responsible for an almost 100-times higher terpenoids accumulation than in cultivated tomato. In wild tomato species, the high density of a specific type of trichomes is also responsible for the high production of acylsugars [
 <xref rid="B204-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">204</xref>]. The high protective role of wild tomato acylsugars is linked to their toxic and sticky nature, which confers the ability to trap and immobilize insects. Moreover, these molecules are also an efficient protection from fungal infections [
