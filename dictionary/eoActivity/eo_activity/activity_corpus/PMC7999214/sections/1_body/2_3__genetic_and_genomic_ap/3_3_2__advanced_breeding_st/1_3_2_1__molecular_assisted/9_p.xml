<p>However, despite all the mQTL identified for SMs, only a few candidate genes have been functionally validated so far [
 <xref rid="B139-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>], and only a limited number of molecular markers have been successfully used in MAB programs [
 <xref rid="B140-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. The reasons for the gap that still exists between the information about the genes and QTL that underpin plant phenotypes and the integration of this information into applied plant improvement are manifold [

 <xref rid="B141-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>]. However, this scenario should be reversed by a wider application of omics data, which promise to accelerate QTL cloning [
 <xref rid="B142-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>], along with improved tools for marker-assisted selection (MAS) (i.e., reliable markers and robust QTL) and enhanced strategies for integrating these tools into breeding programs effectively, without associated genetic drag [
 <xref rid="B141-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>]. In parallel to developments in NGS technologies, newly designed multi parent mapping populations, such as nested association mapping (NAM) and multi- parent advanced generation inter-cross (MAGIC), have also been developed, which are suitable for joint-linkage and association mapping and which significantly improve the power and efficiency of GWAS [

 <xref rid="B121-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. Furthermore, NGS-based approaches, including sequencing-based mapping (SbM), can be used in combination with bulked segregant analysis (BSA), and similar strategies, to help speed the identification of candidate genes [
 <xref rid="B121-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. For example, the QTL-Seq approach involves the use of whole genome resequencing (WGRS) on bulked DNA samples from the phenotypic extremes of a population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) or F2 individuals derived from inter-varietal crosses [
