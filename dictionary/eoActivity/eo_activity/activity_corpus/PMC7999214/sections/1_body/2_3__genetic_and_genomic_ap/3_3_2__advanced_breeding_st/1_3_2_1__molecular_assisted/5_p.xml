<p>The approaches used for the identification of the genetic determinants of the phytochemical component of plants can be either reverse genetics or forward genetics. Within the past 20 years, targeted reverse genetics approaches have played a major role in investigating plant metabolism [

By contrast, top-down approaches have recently been pursued to explore the wide natural genetic diversity for specialized metabolism harbored in interspecific backcross inbred lines (BILs), ILs and, more recently, GWAS, which have been demonstrated to be effective tools to gain further insights into the regulation of plant primary and specialized metabolism [
