<p>In the last decades, the modulation of TFs expression through genetic engineering approaches has emerged as a highly powerful tool to improve specialized metabolism for specific purposes, such as the improvement of the nutritional quality of different crops. In theory, this modulation ensures a relatively coordinated and almost “stoichiometric” production of enzymes, allowing for optimized biosynthesis [

Different strategies may be used: from the traditional overexpression of the TF under the control of a constitutive promoter to a tissue specific expression or induction of point mutations through gene editing techniques. However, such approaches are not always a sure hit, as a single TF is not always sufficient to regulate an entire whole biosynthetic pathway, which usually requires regulatory networks consisting of multiple TFs [
