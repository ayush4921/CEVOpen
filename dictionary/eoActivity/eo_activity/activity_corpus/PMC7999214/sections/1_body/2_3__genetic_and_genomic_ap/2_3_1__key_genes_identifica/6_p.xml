<p>A relatively unbiased contribution to dissect the genetic control of plant metabolic diversity can come from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which explore variation in breeding and natural populations and associate genetic variance to traits of interest, identifying specific QTLs. In cases where accurate metabolite evaluation methods were available, GWAS have been applied to plant metabolic studies (mGWAS) [
