<p>The development of low-coverage sequencing-based GWAS approaches [
 <xref rid="B118-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>] could expand the feasibility of using mGWAS in species lacking large genome sequencing resources, which could be the case for many plant species with peculiar metabolic features. Finally, the demonstration that the genetic architecture of plant metabolome can be highly conserved [

 <xref rid="B120-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>] indicates that comparative mGWAS data may provide information on candidate genes also between related species.
