<p>The functional characterization of TFs involved in the control of anthocyanins metabolism is a good example of how the study of transcriptional regulation provides the basis to fine tuning of specialized metabolic pathways. Anthocyanins are a large family of phenolic compounds widespread in flowers, fruits and vegetables that protect plants from a wide variety of biotic and abiotic stimuli and attract pollinating insects and seed-spreading animals. They are a valuable target in food and crop biofortification as their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions are beneficial to prevent and control diseases, such as cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, obesity, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases [
