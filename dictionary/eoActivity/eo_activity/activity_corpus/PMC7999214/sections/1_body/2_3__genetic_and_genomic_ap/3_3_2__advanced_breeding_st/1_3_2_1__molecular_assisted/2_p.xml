<p>In the 1980s, the development of molecular (DNA) marker technology, and of the derived molecular genetic maps, has promoted crop improvement to rapidly evolve from classical breeding approaches based on phenotypic selection to more effective marker-assisted breeding (MAB). Compared to conventional breeding, MAB offers several important advantages as genotype screening allows more precise and rapid breeding schemes. Furthermore, MAB is particularly appropriate for integrating two or more genes or QTL into an elite genotype (gene pyramiding or gene stacking) [
