<p>Recently, the characterization of enzymes involved in the production of specialized metabolites has advanced enormously, while knowledge of pathway regulation is still somewhat limited [

To maximize fitness and to resolve the cost-benefit paradigm, regulatory networks evolved in the control of perception of external and internal cues, as well as in controlling cellular processes such as epigenetic landscaping, transcription, translation, and allosteric control of the resulting enzymes and regulators [
 <xref rid="B184-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">184</xref>]. For this reason, a comprehensive analysis of the regulation of specialized metabolism should always be addressed from the perspective of combinatorial control among many different pathways, in a broader attempt to harmonize ecological, cellular and molecular data.
