<p>Anthocyanin accumulation in plants is modulated by the WD-repeat/bHLH/MYB complex, that positively regulates dihydroflavonol 4-reductase, anthocyanin synthase and glucosyltransferase gene expression [
 <xref rid="B194-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">194</xref>]. This molecular mechanism was proven to be conserved across many different species via orthologous TFs, being crucial in the determination of color of flowers and fruits in apple, grape and oranges [
 <xref rid="B189-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">189</xref>]. An indirect tinkering of the modulation of this transcriptional control is normally used in standard agriculture and horticulture procedures. For example, as light and UV-B have major roles in activating the expression of TFs that positively regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis, light exclusion through the practice of bagging apples prevents anthocyanin accumulation. Subsequent removal of the bag prior to harvest results in a rapid and uniform accumulation of anthocyanins [
