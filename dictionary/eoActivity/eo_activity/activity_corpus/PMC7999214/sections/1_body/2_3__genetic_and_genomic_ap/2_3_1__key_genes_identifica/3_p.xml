<p>Therefore, several gene isoforms can exist for any target gene, and the identification of the relevant one(s) for a given pathway is a challenging task, since minor changes in enzyme protein sequence may have dramatic effects on specificity and functions. Genome resequencing is increasingly contributing to the discovery of gene variants in a plethora of plant species, starting from earlier large work in species such as tomato, rice and

Along with massive analyses, resequencing of genotypes with peculiar characteristics may highlight structural differences in candidate metabolic genes, as was the case for genes involved in the biosynthesis, accumulation and decoration of phenolic compounds in two long shelf-life traditional varieties of tomato [
