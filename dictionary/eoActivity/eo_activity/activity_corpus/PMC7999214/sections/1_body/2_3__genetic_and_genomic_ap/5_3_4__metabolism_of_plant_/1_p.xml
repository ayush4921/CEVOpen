<p>Given the bioactive nature of SMs, plants have developed specific structures for their accumulation, in order to safely produce and store these compounds while avoiding their possible adverse effects. Considering the vast repertoire of metabolites, tissues accumulation, cell type production, storage and release of these specialized molecules, in this paragraph, we will focus on metabolite production in glandular trichomes. Trichomes are a dedicated biosynthetic and storage structure consisting in epidermal extensions occurring on the surface of the aerial part of plants. They are widely distributed in the plant kingdom and can be distinguished in non-glandular and glandular trichomes. Non-glandular trichomes are widely diffused in angiosperms and gymnosperms down to lycophytes, ferns and bryophytes. The model species 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> possesses non-glandular trichomes, whereas all the essential oils-producing species within Lamiaceae, such as mint, sage, rosemary, basil, but also Asteraceae and Solanaceae, possess glandular trichomes. Glandular trichomes are able to produce, store and often secrete exudates carrying a terrific plethora of chemo-diverse molecules, such as essential oils and oleoresins, phenols, glycerids and very complex terpenes. Outstanding examples of high economic value are the anti-malarial artemisinin in

 <italic>Salvia divinorum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B203-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">203</xref>], but also acylsugars that are glycolipids consisting of a sugar core linked to straight or branched acylic chains [
 <xref rid="B204-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">204</xref>]. To biosynthesize these complex molecules, plants require an incredible energetic effort. The trade-off for the producing plants resides in the ecological role of these molecules that allows increased fitness and higher capability to survive in hostile environments.
