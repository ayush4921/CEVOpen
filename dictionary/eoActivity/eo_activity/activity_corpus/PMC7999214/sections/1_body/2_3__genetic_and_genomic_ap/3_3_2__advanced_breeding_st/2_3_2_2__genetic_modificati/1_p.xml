<p>Metabolic engineering could be particularly useful whenever traditional or MAB approaches are hindered by low variability in natural and breeding populations, and limited -omic tools. It includes overexpression and/or competition with the target pathway, overcoming rate-limiting steps, stopping the catabolism pathway of the desired product and/or inhibiting other pathways with the final aim of optimizing the production of target specialized compounds.</p>
