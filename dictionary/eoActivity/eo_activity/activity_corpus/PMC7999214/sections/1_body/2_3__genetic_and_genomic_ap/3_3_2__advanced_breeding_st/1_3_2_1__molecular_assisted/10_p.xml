<p>Therefore, NGS plays a key role in a genomics-assisted breeding pipeline, as it enhances the speed and precision of trait mapping to identify genes and QTL that become the targets of MAS. Furthermore, NGS allows calculating the genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs) based on genome-wide information that predict the breeding value of individuals in a breeding population using genomic selection (GS) [
