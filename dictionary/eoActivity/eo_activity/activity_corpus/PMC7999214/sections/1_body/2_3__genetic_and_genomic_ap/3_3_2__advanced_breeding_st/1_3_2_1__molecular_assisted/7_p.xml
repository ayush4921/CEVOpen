<p>As regards the use of natural variability as a rich source of potentially valuable genes/alleles for breeding programs that aim to modulate the content of SMs in plants, the Solanaceae family represents a good reference system. Specifically, in tomato, two independent studies, based on a mutant inbred line [
 <xref rid="B132-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>] or an interspecific 
 <italic>Solanum chmielewskii</italic> IL population [
 <xref rid="B133-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>], demonstrated that the colorless-peel 
 <italic>y</italic> mutant on chromosome 1 is controlled by a 
 <italic>SlMYB12</italic> regulated transcriptional network, which orchestrates the accumulation of yellow-colored flavonoid (naringenin chalcone) in the fruit epidermis (peels from pink fruit are colorless due to the absence of flavonoid). Subsequently, a GWAS using 231 tomato accessions, with known phenotypes, allowed the identification of the causative variant, with three recessive alleles underlying the 
 <italic>y</italic> phenotype, which represent useful markers for pink tomato breeding [
 <xref rid="B103-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. The same 
 <italic>S. chmielewskii</italic> IL population was used to identify genomic regions underlying the production of tomato fruit semi-polar specialized metabolites, including alkaloids and phenylpropanoids [
 <xref rid="B134-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. The integration of biochemical pathway knowledge and genomic information allowed the identification of several candidate genes, which could be used in breeding programs. Moreover, in eggplant (
 <italic>Solanum melongena</italic>), an interspecific mapping population was used to map candidate genes for fruit chlorogenic acid content [
 <xref rid="B135-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>,
 <xref rid="B136-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. This was assisted by the use of synteny of the orthologous genes in tomato, the solanaceous species with the broadest genetic and genomic toolkit. In peppers (
 <italic>Capsicum</italic> spp.), the combined use of genome-based QTL mapping and GWAS has proven to be a powerful approach to identify candidate genes associated with capsaicinoid content, which was not easily achieved in previous studies using low-density genetic maps [
 <xref rid="B137-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. The obtained results have also confirmed the minor effects of each locus and the epistatic effects between QTLs, suggesting that multiple markers should be used together for marker-assisted selection.
