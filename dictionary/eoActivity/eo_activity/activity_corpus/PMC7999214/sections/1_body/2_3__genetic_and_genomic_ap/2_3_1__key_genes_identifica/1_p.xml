<p>Successful strategies for pathway engineering rely on the careful and knowledge-based choice of the appropriate candidate genes that govern the output of the target pattern. Detailed knowledge is needed of all the enzymes implicated in the target pathway, their isoforms and the rate-limiting reactions for synthesis and catabolism, as well as of the spatial localization of metabolism [

 <xref rid="B100-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. This biochemical understanding of the core reactions needs to be conveyed to the identification of the genes coding for the key biosynthetic enzymes, the tailoring enzymes that catalyze the decorating reactions modifying the molecular backbones, as well as the regulating factors that orchestrate the functioning of the entire pathway.
