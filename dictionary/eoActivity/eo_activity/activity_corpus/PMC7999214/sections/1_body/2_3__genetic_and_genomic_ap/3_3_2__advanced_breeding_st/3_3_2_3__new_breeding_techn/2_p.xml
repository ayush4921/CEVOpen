<p>The very fast development and expansion of genome editing tools have opened new possibilities to manipulate and modulate gene expression acting at several levels including transcription, mRNA processing and mRNA translation. All these processes are under the control of a series of 
 <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements, which can be modified by genome editing technologies. For this purpose, tool kits have been developed, and their efficacy has been proven, in which dCas9 is fused to effector domains, such as transcriptional activators and repressors, to modulate expression of target genes [
