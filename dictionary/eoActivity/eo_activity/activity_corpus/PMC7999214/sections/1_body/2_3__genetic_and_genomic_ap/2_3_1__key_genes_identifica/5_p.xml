<p>Given all the obstacles that can hinder candidate gene(s) identification, however carefully and knowledge-based conducted, this approach may prove unsuccessful, also because the number of involved genes may still be beyond our prediction power. Epigenetic control and contribution from the organelle genomes add up further complexity to the definition of promising targets for metabolic engineering. Emblematic is a study on a quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping analysis for carotenoid genes in a population of tomato introgression lines (ILs), which found that only 5 of 23 carotenoid biosynthetic genes co-segregated with QTLs for fruit color [
