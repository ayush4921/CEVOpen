<p>Gene fusion and, to a minor extent, horizontal gene transfer, contributed to the evolution of metabolic networks, but the major drive for the diversification of the complexity of plant specialized metabolism is considered to be gene duplication, often of genes of the primary metabolism, resulting in dosage effects and neofunctionalization of paralogs [
