<p>The vast and ever-increasing availability of genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic data for many plants, beyond model species and representative crops, has greatly accelerated and refined the process of identifying target genes controlling the plant metabolic diversity, and bioinformatics has become the most common starting point for the prediction of gene function. Tools such as plantiSMASH and PhytoClust allow automated analysis of genomic and transcriptomic data for the identification of candidate metabolic genes, also exploiting the clustering in close genomic regions that often occurs for this type of genes [

 <xref rid="B109-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. Analysis of co-expression networks across multiple conditions can be feasible also for non-sequenced species, and biologically relevant information can then be obtained by data integration with functional annotation databases such as Gene Ontology (GO) [

Further understanding of gene functions and regulatory relationships can be inferred from gene-gene interactions, such as searching for targets of known transcription factors within the network of co-expressed genes, with several tools being available for gene interaction network analysis [

Given the complexity of plant specialized metabolism and the high similarity between genes with different functions, the identified candidate genes need to be confirmed by forward or reverse genetics, or heterologous expression approaches.
