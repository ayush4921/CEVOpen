<p>CRISPR/Cas9 technology has been mainly used to investigate the plant biosynthetic potential through switching off the competing biosynthetic pathways and shifting of the metabolite flux toward the production of the target compounds. For example, a considerable decrease in thebaine, codeine, noscapine and papaverine levels in stem together with a dramatic reduction in the S-reticuline and laudanosine has been achieved by editing the 
 <italic>4â€²OMT2</italic> gene, which regulates the biosynthetic pathway of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids in 
 <italic>Papaver somniferum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B174-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>]. The authors also reported that the edited plants produced a novel uncharacterized alkaloid, showing the potential of the CRISPR system in the production of new SMs. CRISPR/Cas9 approach was also used to edit the rosmarinic acid synthase (
 <italic>SmRAS</italic>) gene in 
 <italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic> [
 <xref rid="B175-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">175</xref>]. This modification led to a reduction of phenolic acids content such as rosmarinic acid together with an increase in its precursor 3,4-dihydroxy phenyl lactic acid, in the edited hairy root lines, especially in the homozygous. In another study in 
 <italic>S. miltiorrhiza</italic>, CRISPR/Cas9 was used to knock out the 
 <italic>SmCPS1</italic> gene coding for a diterpene synthase, involved in the synthesis of tanshinones, with the aim to evaluate the possibility to promote the accumulation of the substrate for taxol synthesis, as tanshinones and taxol share the same precursor (Geranylgeranyl Pyrophosphate) [
 <xref rid="B176-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">176</xref>]. A number of studies have focused on the manipulation of anthocyanin and flavonoid biosynthetic pathways. Flower color modification using the CRISPR/Cas9 system was successfully achieved in 
 <italic>Torenia fournieri</italic> L. flowers by editing a flavanone 3-hydroxylase (
 <italic>F3H</italic>) gene, while flower shapes and colors were altered in 
 <italic>Ipomoea nil</italic> by editing the dihydroflavonol-4-reductase-B (
 <italic>DFR-B</italic>) gene [
