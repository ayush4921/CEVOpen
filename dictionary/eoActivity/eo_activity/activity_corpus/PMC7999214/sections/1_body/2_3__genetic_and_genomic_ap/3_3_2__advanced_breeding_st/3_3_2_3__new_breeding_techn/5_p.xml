<p>Together with key biosynthetic structural genes, interesting candidates for the application of NBTs to modulate specialized metabolisms are represented by TFs (see next paragraph). Hypothetically, specific biosynthetic pathways can be constitutively switched on mutating negative regulators or using CRISPR/Cas fusions with activators directed towards key structural genes or positive regulators [

 <xref rid="B181-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">181</xref>]. An example is the CRISPR-Cas9 SunTag systems consisting of two modules: dCas9 fused to tandem GCN4 peptide repeats and a single chain variable fragment (scFv) GCN4 antibody fused to superfolder-GFP (sfGFP) and VP64. In this way, multiple copies of the VP64 transcriptional activator associate with the GCN4 repeats and are recruited to a specific locus via dCas9/guide RNAs [
