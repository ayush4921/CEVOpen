<p>NBTs have the potential to change the pace and course of crop biotechnology by overcoming most of the limitations imposed by conventional genetic engineering techniques, as they allow fast and precise targeted genome modifications, in some cases indistinguishable from naturally occurring mutations, without leaving any foreign DNA. NBT comprise the use of zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcriptional activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated nuclease 9 (Cas9) system [

 <xref rid="B165-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>]. Besides the well-known Cas9, new Cas nucleases have been identified and/or improved to generate CRISPR/Cas twins with new properties. For example, Cas12a/Cpf1, xCAS9 and Cas9-NG are able to recognize a wider range of PAMs, while Cas12a/Cpf1 cleaves the target DNA generating staggered ends [

 <xref rid="B168-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">168</xref>]. Furthermore, the fusion of a catalytically inactive Cas9 (Cas9 variants, dCas9 or Cas9 nickase) to a cytosine or adenosine deaminase domain allows the conversion of C:G to T:A, and A:T to G:C, respectively [

 <xref rid="B170-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>]. These base editing (BE) systems are expected to be further implemented thanks to the recent discovery of “prime editing” that allows targeted insertions, deletions, all 12 possible base-to-base conversions and combinations thereof at genomic targets without any requirement of double strand breaks or donor DNA templates [
