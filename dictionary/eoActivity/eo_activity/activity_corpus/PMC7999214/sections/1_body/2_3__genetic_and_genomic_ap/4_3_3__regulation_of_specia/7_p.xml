<p>These examples and the ever-growing wealth of data about the role of TFs in specialized metabolism show that artificial modulation of transcriptional regulation could be one of the most promising strategies towards biofortification. Understanding the structural characteristics of these genes (and their encoded proteins) explains how TFs are regulated at a transcriptional (auto-/cross-regulations), post-transcriptional (alternative splicing, miRNA) and post-translational levels (interactions, localization and modifications), unveiling new strategies for the rational engineering of the metabolic pathways that can be implemented through transgenic technologies, genome editing and and/or marker assisted breeding.</p>
