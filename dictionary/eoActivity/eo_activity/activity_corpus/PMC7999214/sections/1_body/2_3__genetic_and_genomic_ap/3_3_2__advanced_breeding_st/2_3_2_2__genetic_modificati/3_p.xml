<p>In the last decade, plant in vitro systems such as culture of organs (e.g., hairy roots) and cells confirmed their several advantages as “green cell factories” to produce specialized metabolites, as compared to both transgenic plants and heterologous microbial systems (e.g., yeast and bacteria) [

 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4dot1-ijms-22-02887">Section 4.1</xref>). In particular, Hairy Root Culture (HRC) has been widely explored for producing valuable specialized metabolites [
 <xref rid="B153-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>]. HRCs can be obtained by transformation of plants with 
 <italic>A. rhizogenes</italic> that introduces the genes 
 <italic>rolA</italic>, 
 <italic>rolB</italic>, and 
 <italic>rolC</italic> in the host plant genome by the root-inducing (Ri) plasmid [
 <xref rid="B154-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>]. Transformed roots are characterized by higher growth rate, genetic stability and can be propagated in growth regulators-free media also in large-scale bioreactors [

 <xref rid="B156-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>]. Singh and collaborators have developed a protocol where 
 <italic>A. rhizogenes</italic> was used to induce hairy roots in the tomato explants and demonstrated that they efficiently accumulate several health-promoting compounds such as rutin, quercetin and kaempferol [
 <xref rid="B157-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>]. A recent study describes protocols to establish stable hairy root lines from leaf explants of radish. The produced transgenic hairy roots showed increased production of flavonoids (quercetin) [
 <xref rid="B158-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>]. Strategies based on overexpression of a R2R3-MYB-type TF (
 <italic>VvMYB15</italic>) in 
 <italic>V. vinifera</italic> hairy roots allowed to get an increased production of stilbenes, a small group of phenylpropanoid compounds with a role in plant defense but also with pharmacological properties in the prevention/protection from cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, cancer and diabetes [
