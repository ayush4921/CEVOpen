<p>Pathway engineering programs make use of gene cloning technologies and different gene transfer technologies such as 
 <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-based transformation or alternative methods (e.g., particle bombardment and electroporation), to ensure transient or stable DNA introduction into host plant cells to manipulate plant metabolism [

 <xref rid="B144-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. Although numerous species are recalcitrant to different transformation methods, to date, ample literature is available with examples that demonstrate how approaches based on insertion or deletion of key genes from the core metabolic pathway or on ectopic expression of transcription factors (TFs) that control biosynthetic pathways (see more details in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot3-ijms-22-02887">Section 3.3</xref>) have been employed to modulate levels and identity of specialized compounds in several plant species [
 <xref rid="B145-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>]. Several efforts have been dedicated to the modification of the phenylpropanoids pathway in crops [

 <xref rid="B147-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. As an example, the core flavonoids metabolic pathway has been addressed towards improving these relevant compounds in 
 <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic> [

 <xref rid="B148-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. The first attempts to induce flavonoid production in tomato started in the early 2000s with the overexpression of different structural genes of the biosynthetic pathway. In tomato, flavonoids (i.e., naringenin chalcone and rutin) are present mainly in the peel and only traces can be detected in the flesh. Ectopic expression of single (chalcone isomerase, 
 <italic>CHI</italic>) or multiple (chalcone synthase, 
 <italic>CHI</italic>, flavanone 3-hydroxylase and flavonol synthase) structural genes successfully enhanced the levels of flavonols (i.e., quercetin- and kaempferol- glycosides) in the peel [

 <xref rid="B149-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>] of tomato fruit. Although an increase in the accumulation of different phenylpropanoids was observed, contributing to increase the total antioxidant activity, no anthocyanin synthesis was registered [

 <xref rid="B146-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>]. Recently, co-expression of the onion chalcone isomerase in 
 <italic>Delila bHLH</italic> and 
 <italic>Rosea 1 R2R3-MYB</italic>-expressing purple tomato (see more details in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot3-ijms-22-02887">Section 3.3</xref>) converted the flavonoid flux to flavonol as well as further increased the content of anthocyanins [
 <xref rid="B151-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>], highlighting that combined strategies based on the modulation of structural genes and TFs that control this biosynthetic pathway are highly effective.
