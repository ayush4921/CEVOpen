<p>Both 
 <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> and particle bombardment-based transformation have been effective for an array of plant species; however, several challenges such as limited host range of

 <xref rid="B161-ijms-22-02887" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>]. In recent years, a new transformation approach based on various nanomaterials like carbon nanotubes or magnetic nanoparticles can bypass the barrier of the cell wall and transfer their cargo including nucleic acids into plants in a transient or stable manner [
