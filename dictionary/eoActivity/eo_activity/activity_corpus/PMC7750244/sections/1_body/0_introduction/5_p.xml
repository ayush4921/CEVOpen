 <italic>Lippia origanoides</italic>, whose EO is extracted from its leaves, is a shrub native to the semi-arid regions of Minas Gerais, and it has antimicrobial activity [
 <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Chromatography combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (CG-EM) has been used to elucidate the chemical composition of the EO of 
 <italic>L. origanoides</italic>. The most important constituents identified were carvacrol (ranging from 29% to 32%), followed by o-cymene (23% to 25.57%) and methyl thymol ether (10.03% to 11.50%) [

 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These compounds have shown antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> [
 <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], the most prevalent microorganisms in mastitis. A concentration of 120 Î¼L/mL of 
 <italic>L. origanoides</italic> EO inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Salmonella choleraesuis</italic> without causing cellular toxicity [
 <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. At the same concentration, the EO presented antiseptic activity against these microorganisms and inhibited their growth after 5 min (for 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>) or 15 min (for 
 <italic>S. choleraesuis</italic>) of treatment [
 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These studies suggest that the 
 <italic>L. origanoides</italic> EO can be used to formulate antiseptic products capable of slowing microbial growth.
