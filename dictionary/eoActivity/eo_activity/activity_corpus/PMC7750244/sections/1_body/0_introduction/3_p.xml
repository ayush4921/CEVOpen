<p>The utilization of antibacterial compounds in the sanitization of teats has been viewed with great concern by the public health and alimentary security. Hence, different methodologies are being explored to prevent the development of mastitis in the herds, including the development of vaccines. A recent study of vaccines in the prevention of 
 <italic>Staphylococcu</italic>s 
 <italic>aureus</italic> bovine mastitis suggests that live-attenuated SCVs vaccines can induce strong humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, which are crucial for protection [
