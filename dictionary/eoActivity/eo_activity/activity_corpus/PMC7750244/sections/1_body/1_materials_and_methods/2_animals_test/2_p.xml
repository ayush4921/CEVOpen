<p>The diagnostic tests for clinical and subclinical mastitis (SCM) were performed twice a day for 1 month, from the commencement of the experiment and until the end of the experiment. The diagnosis of CM in cows was determined by the examination of changes in the udder, detection of flakes and clots with gland swelling or redness, rise in temperature, swelling, hardness of udder, and changes in milk color, or systemic illnesses such as fever, depression, weakness, and dehydration. For the diagnosis of SCM, the California Mastitis Test was used as reported. The milking equipment and management practices were monitored once a day to minimize machine-mediated infections.</p>
