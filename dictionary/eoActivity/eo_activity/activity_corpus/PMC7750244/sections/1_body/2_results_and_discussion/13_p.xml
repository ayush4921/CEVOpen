<p>Oleoresin (OR) and the EO of 
 <italic>Copaifera</italic> spp. were investigated against microorganisms isolated from milk samples of cows diagnosed with Grade III SCM. The OR exhibited significant antimicrobial activity (minimum inhibitory concentrations [MIC] ≤100 μg/mL) against samples of 
 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> coagulase-positive, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> coagulase-negative, and 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> but were inactive and weak to inactive, respectively, against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. This demonstrates that this raw plant material is promising for the development of phytotherapeutic drugs against bovine mastitis [
