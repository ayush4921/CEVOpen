<p>On investigation of the presence of the main pathogens that cause mastitis, it is notable that 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> was not found in any of the 384 samples of milk. It was noticed that 13.54% of microorganisms belong to SCN (n=26/192) and 9.89% to 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> spp. (n=19/192) isolated during treatment. The good practices in milking and appropriate management, as well as the separation of animals in batches during the experimental period may have contributed to the absence of pathogens. Hence, this indicates that the tested products, both control and treatment, were efficient in preventing microorganisms from entering by the ceiling channel causing mastitis. This can explain the absence of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> in the experimental animals. It is notable that no significant difference was observed between the sampling and the treatments for both SCN and 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> spp. during the trial (p&gt;0.05) (
