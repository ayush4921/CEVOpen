<p>Current research is analyzing alternative control methods and medicinal plants that contribute to natural, safe, effective, and inexpensive options. Studies on 
 <italic>Minthostachys verticillata</italic> demonstrated that the EO of this species and limonene, one of its compounds, inhibited the growth of mastitis pathogens [
 <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The EO of 
 <italic>M. verticillata</italic> with a minimal inhibitory concentration of 29.0 mg/mL was more effective than limonene, also showing bactericidal action against 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic> [
 <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This oil affected the mature biofilm of isolated strains serving as a therapy against bovine mastitis pathogens by inhibiting the development of pathogenic bacteria [
