 <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] investigated the antimicrobial activity and the cytotoxicity of 
 <italic>Tagetes minuta</italic> L. EO against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and observed a MIC of 1.0 mg/mL for 
 <italic>strain of S. aureus</italic> and five bacteria isolated from mastitis milk, including a multi-resistant strain; and 3.0 mg/mLfor strain of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and two bacteria isolated from mastitis milk. However, a strong cytotoxic effect in the MAC-T cells was found in the oil concentrations from 10 Î¼g/mL and resulted in over 90% of cell death. These results suggested that although the antimicrobial activity was identified against the main agents of bovine mastitis, the intramammary use of 
 <italic>T. minuta</italic> oil may not be recommended. On the other hand, it is important to highlight the potential of the EO as an antiseptic or use as a sanitizer [
