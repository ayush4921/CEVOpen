<p>With these encouraging results, the rates of IMI induced by SNC and 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> spp. were evaluated; additionally, no significant difference was observed (p=0.8884), as this value was smaller than the PROB value (0.9711). This suggests that the conventional and alternative treatments did not interfere with the occurrence of IMI by the microorganisms under study. The efficacy of PEX analyzed in this study showed a rate of 0.41 for new infections by SCN, while 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> spp. showed a rate of approximately zero (0) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure-3</xref>). This value is according to the recommendations of Ceballosâ€“Marquez 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], in whose work; the value of 0.5 was adopted. There was no significant difference (p&gt;0.05) for SCN and 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> spp. regarding IMI in both treatments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure-3</xref>). When assessing the non-inferiority margin (d=50%) [
 <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], it is observed that the effectiveness of the PEX is not inferior to the CNV.
