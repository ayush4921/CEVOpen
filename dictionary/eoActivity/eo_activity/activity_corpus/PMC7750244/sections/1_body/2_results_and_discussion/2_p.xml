<p>Therefore, the determination of the efficacy of teat disinfectant products against bacteria naturally present on the teat skin is important. A study determined the impact of ten pre- and post-milking teat disinfectant products with different ingredients of varying concentrations on the reduction of teat skin bacterial load without damaging the teats [

 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Of these, it was notable that the product containing 0.6% w/w diamine was the most effective against the bacterial populations of staphylococcal and streptococcal isolates on teat skin with a reduction of 90% and 94%, respectively, while another product containing 0.5% w/w iodine resulted in the highest reduction (91%) in coliforms on teat skin [

The results of this study corroborate with the previous results, as the product disinfectants tested here did not cause any alteration in the incidence of new IMI.
