<p>The presence of microorganisms in the groups of teats was identified by comparison between the teat groups. No significant difference was observed in the frequency of SNC and 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> spp. (p&gt;0.05) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure-2</xref>). Although no significant difference was observed between the used products, it is important to consider the frequency of SNC and 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> spp. observed in the results of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure-1</xref> as these microorganisms are potentially pathogenic. Mello 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] established similar results and described that the presence of these pathogens characterized the occurrence of contagious mastitis, indicating that prophylactic measures and the adoption of pre- and post-milking teat disinfection are essential in mastitis control. Sampimon 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] considered SNC as secondary pathogens with a large prevalence in cattle herds. It can cause moderate mammary infection acting such as a causative agent of clinical and SCM with severe disease [
 <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], increased conventional CS [
 <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and reducing the milk production [
