<p>A solid medium diffusion procedure using wells in dishes was used to determine the antiyeast activity of all EOs [

 <xref rid="B44-molecules-25-05126" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. For this, 1 mL of 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> suspension with a concentration of 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL was uniformly spread on a sterile MEA petri dish (diameter 9 cm). After inoculum absorption by agar, wells were made using sterile glass tubes (diameter 6 mm) which were filled with 10 µL of each EO. The disc radius was not included. Negative controls were prepared with only 10 µL of DMSO. Petri dishes were incubated at 28 °C for 48 h; antiyeast activity was evaluated by measuring the diameter of the growth inhibition halos and was expressed in millimeters. All determinations were carried out in triplicate.
