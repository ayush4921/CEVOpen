 <italic>mandshuricum</italic> cultivar “zhongnong xixin 1” was used as plant material in this study. When plants became dormant, 1000 plants (4-year-old) were transplanted into 30 x 40 cm (diameter x height) pots containing humus soil (pH = 6.28). Each pot contained five plants and pots were placed at Jilin Agricultural University Medicinal Herbs Garden (43.80’N, 125.42’E). One year later, soon after the leaves appeared, four light treatments were applied. For Treatment I, the plants were exposed to 100% full sunlight in order to receive natural light irradiation during the day. In the other three treatments, the plants were covered with different layers of black nylon shade netting to receive about 50% (II), 24% (III) and 12% (IV) of full sunlight (
