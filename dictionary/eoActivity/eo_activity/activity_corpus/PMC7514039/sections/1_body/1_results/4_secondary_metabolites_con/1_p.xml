<p>In order to further confirm the positive effect of high light treatments on the shikimic acid and cinnamic acid pathways, we evaluated the accumulation of key precursor metabolites (shikimic acid, phenylalanine, cinnamic acid and 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid) involved in these pathways in leaf, fibrous root and whole plant samples collected from 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>heterotropoides</italic> var. 
 <italic>mandshuricum</italic>. grown in the four light treatments. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237952.g007">Fig 7</xref> shows the ion chromatograms of shikimic acid, phenylalanine, cinnamic acid and 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid. Our results showed that shikimic acid accumulated only in leaf tissues but the other three metabolites were detected in leaves and fibrous roots (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237952.g008">Fig 8</xref>). In addition, leaf samples had significantly higher contents of the four metabolites than root samples. Overall, we observed that the contents of the four metabolites increased proportionally with the light intensity in both tissues (
