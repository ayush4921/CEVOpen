<p>As an important medicinal plant, increasing key bioactive molecules in 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>heterotropoides</italic> var. 
 <italic>mandshuricum</italic> is crucial. Although 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>heterotropoides</italic> var. 
 <italic>mandshuricum</italic> is a skiophyte plant species, this research demonstrated that increasing the intensity of light irradiation results in increased leaf mass per area and net photosynthetic rate, indicating that 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>heterotropoides</italic> var. 
 <italic>mandshuricum</italic>. is able to adapt to high light intensity. Furthermore, we showed that high light irradiation significantly increased the content of essential oil mainly because of the strong accumulation of phenylpropane compounds. Overall, our findings suggest that high sunlight treatment could be an effective approach for increasing essential oil content and quality in 
 <italic>A</italic>.
