<p id="Par7">Medicinal plants are imperious sources of treasurable secondary metabolites and thus, contribute to availability of natural drugs in global markets [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Turmeric; 
 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> belong to ginger family; Zingiberaceae. Turmeric powder from dried ground rhizomes of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> possess culinary uses, act as natural product with analgesic, antibacterial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and digestive properties. Hence, biological activities of turmeric, its health promoting effects and disease prevention have attracted several applications in pharmaceutical, food and biotechnological industries [

 <italic>Aloe vera,</italic> is another medicinal plant with immense bioactive compounds allied with some pharmacological properties like wound healing, antifungal activity, hypoglycemic or antidiabetic effects, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, immunomodulatory and gastroprotective [

 <italic>A. vera</italic> in phytomedicine indicate its several uses in pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Natural products in plants act as reservoirs of novel bioactive compounds and as excellent source of drug discovery with diversâ€™ biopharmaceutical applications [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], hence, biologically active compounds in medicinal plants can be exploited and incorporated in AFCs, which will be a newsworthy option towards new prototype antifungal agents. This study therefore, revealed synergistic antifungal potential of over-the-counter AFCs with TEO or AVG against clinically important pathogenic fungi.
