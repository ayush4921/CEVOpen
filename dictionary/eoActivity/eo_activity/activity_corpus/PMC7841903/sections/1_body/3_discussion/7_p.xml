<p id="Par37">In this study, it was observed that the combination of plant extracts; TEO or AVG with AFC was effective against all the tested fungi. Jankasem et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] revealed that turmeric oil displayed better anti-dermatophytic activity with the MICs of 1.56–6.25 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL when compared to 3.90–7.81 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL of ketoconazole. Shin and Lim [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] revealed that antifungal potential of ketoconazole was significantly improved against 
 <italic>Trichophyton schoenleinii, T. erinacei and T. soudanense</italic> when combined with EO of 
 <italic>Pelargonium graveolens</italic>. The FICi obtained for oils of thyme, cinnamon, clove and eucalyptus combined with amphotericin B against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>A. niger</italic> suggested that synergistic of antifungal drugs with herbs (oil or and extracts) yielded efficacious dose for the treatment of fungal infections and thus, minimizing its side effects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Most EO of 
 <italic>Styrax tonkinensis, Lavandula angustifolia, Melaleuca alternifolia, Rosmarinus officinalis,</italic> and 
 <italic>Pelargonium graveolens</italic> and its fractional components; geraniol and citronellol exhibited additive effect when combined with amphotericin B and with ketoconazole against 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp., which resulted to FICi ranged from 0.52 to 1.00 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. In the findings of Scalas et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], EOs of 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> (oregano), 
 <italic>Pinus sylvestris</italic> (pine), and 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> (thyme red) and their components (α-pinene, carvacrol, thymol) exhibited good antifungal activity against 
 <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> strains compared to fluconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole, and thus, revealed the synergistic and additive for EO and azole (itraconazole) combination. Potential synergistic combination between two or more antimicrobial agents help in reducing resistant mutants, exhibit more antimicrobial action, toxicity against pathogens and thus, serve as effective alternative traditional medicine for the treatment of various fungal infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. The use of EOs aromatic compounds and plant extracts in formulation of topical AFCs need to be embraced to achieve optimal antifungal activity with no side effects. The availability of natural products (EOs or plant extracts) and development of combined antimicrobial agents are often an optional therapy for dermatological infections [
