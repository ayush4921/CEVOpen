<p id="Par34">Bawankar et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] reported the presence of hexadecanoic acid, 1-(phenylthioxomethyl) piperidine, 6-hydroxyhexane-3-1, octadecanoic acid, tricosane, 1-octadecanol, stigmasterol, docosane in the ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>A. vera</italic>. Hydroxybenzhydrazide was found in AVG. It is a hydroxylated phenolic compound with strong and moderate antimicrobial activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Hydroxylated phenolic compounds like pyrocatechol are known to be toxic to microorganisms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The toxicity of phenolic compounds to microorganisms are believed to be related to the number of hydroxyl groups, which inhibit microbial growth by cell membrane disruption and protein denaturation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Alpha-phellandrene, α-pinene, myrcene, linalol, geraniol, ar-turmerone, turmerone, α-curcumene, zingiberene, turmerones, curcuminiods, geraniol acetate beta-sesquiphellandrene, (2E,6E)-farnesol, camphene, tricyclen cineole were major bioactive compounds as aromatic compounds in EOs with dynamic antimicrobial features [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Alpha-phellandrene is a terpene-derivative metabolite, which is mostly found in volatile oils and plays a role of an antimicrobial agent [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The presence of α-phellandrene in this study correlates with the findings of Mukesi et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] who examined the bioactivity of commercial antimicrobials, EO and ethanolic extracts of 
 <italic>Olea europaea</italic>. Another major component found in TEO is 2-carene. It is a bicyclic monoterpene that occurs in several EOs with a sweet and pungent odour. Carene and its derivatives are of modest relevance in the perfume industry [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], hence, its presence in TEO could contributed to spicy aromatic scent. Farnesene, a volatile compound, which was identified in TEO is known to be responsible for the characteristic taste and flavour of turmeric related to peppermint [
