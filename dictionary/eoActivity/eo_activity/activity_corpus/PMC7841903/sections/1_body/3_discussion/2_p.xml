<p id="Par32">The efficacy of AFCs (azole creams) such as clotrimazole, fluconazole, and ketoconazole against selected pathogenic fungi was observed, while fungi such as 
 <italic>Candida albicans, Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes</italic> required higher concentration of AFCs before being inhibited. Shivamurthy et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] reported that sertaconazole showed better anti-dermatophytic in clinical parameters than topical clotrimazole within a span of 3 weeks in the treatment of 
 <italic>Tinea corporis</italic>. Sabatelli et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] tested triazoles against wide number of clinically important pathogenic fungi (19,000 yeast and mould) and found out that, species of 
 <italic>Candida</italic> and 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> exhibited resistance to fluconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole and amphotericin B except posaconazole that was more efficient. Azole or triazole are commonly used antifungal agents that suppress fungi growth by inhibiting a key enzyme; lanosterol 14alpha demethylase, which occurs through the binding of the free nitrogen atom of the azole ring to the iron atom of the heme-group of the enzyme [
