<p id="Par35">TEO exhibited pronounce inhibition against 
 <italic>Candida albicans, Penicillium notatum,</italic> species of 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> and 
 <italic>Trichophyton</italic>. Ferreira et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] attributed the inhibition of 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> growth at 0.10%, reduction of their viable spores at 0.10% and complete inhibition at 0.50% to ar-turmerone 
 <italic>α</italic>-turmerone and 
 <italic>β</italic>-turmerone, being a major component of EO of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic>. EOs components act as antifungal agents (fungistatic and fungicidal) against fungi by deactivating or disrupting the structure and function of membranes or organelles of fungal cell and/or inhibiting the nuclear material or protein synthesis inactivation, inhibition of intracellular and extracellular enzymes [
