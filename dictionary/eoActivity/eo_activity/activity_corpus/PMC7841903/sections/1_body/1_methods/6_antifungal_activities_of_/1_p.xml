<p id="Par14">The antifungal assay was carried out using the agar well diffusion method described by CLSI [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Suspensions of fungi (1.0 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> sfu/ml) was adjusted with the aid of spectrophotometer (UNICO S-1100 RS) to 0.5 McFarland standard. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO 2% v/v) was used to reconstitute since most of AFCs and plant extracts (TEO and AVG) were not soluble in sterile distilled water. The concentration of AFCs, TEO and AVG were reconstituted to 10.0 mg/ml. Plant extract was sterilized using a Millipore membrane filter (0.22 μm). The sterility of TEO and AVG were confirmed after Millipore filtration, by introducing 0.1 ml of supposed sterile extract into sterilized nutrient agar and potato dextrose agar. Each labelled plate was seeded with tested fungi by means of sterile swab stick rolled on potato dextrose agar. Sterile cork borer was used to make well (6 mm) in the Petri dishes. Aliquots of TEO, AVG and AFCs (50 μl) were dropped in each well. DMSO solution was used as the negative control. The plates were incubated at 26 °C for 48 h. The zones of inhibition around well were measured in millimeter (mm). For synergism activity, concentration of each AFCs, TEO and AVG was adjusted to 3.0 mg/ml.
