  <p>Abundance comparison of 1224 identified proteins in rat brain tissues. Ordering by abundance in Aβ1-42 (II; red dots). Protein abundances from Aβ1-42 and 1%OmEO (III; light green squares) and Aβ1-42 and 3%OmEO (IV; dark green diamonds) are overlaid. With numbers (red: above and black: below) are marked the proteins whose abundances were modulated by OmEO. The 2× threshold is represented by dark grey line and the 3× threshold by the light grey line. The blue vertical dashed lines mark borders in between which differential abundances were analyzed.</p>
