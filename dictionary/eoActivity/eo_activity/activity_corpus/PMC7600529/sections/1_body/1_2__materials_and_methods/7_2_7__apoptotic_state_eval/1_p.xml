<p>A cell death detection ELISA kit (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) was used for quantification of histone-associated DNA fragments. Following the protocol provided by the manufacturer, the reconstituted biotinylated anti-histone antibody was incubated for 1 h and then washed from the microplate (MP) module. For the non-specific binding sites blocking, the incubation solution was added on the MP module and kept for 30 min. Following a washing step, the sample solution, containing 1:20 dilution of the centrifuged hippocampal homogenate prepared for biochemical assays, was incubated on MP module for 1 h and 30 min. Then, the sample solution was washed, and the reconstituted anti-DNA- peroxidase (POD) antibody was incubated for 1 h and 30 min. Following the washing of unbound anti-DNA-POD antibody, the substrate solution was added on the MP module and incubated on a shaker plate for 10 min. The POD retained in the imunocomplex was photometrically determined using a microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA). The enrichment factor, reflecting n-fold apoptosis, was calculated as the absorbance of the sample/absorbance of negative control, where the negative control was represented by the sham-operated rats.</p>
