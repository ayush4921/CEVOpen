<p>The hippocampi stored in RNA Save solution in frozen state were allowed to thaw for 2 min at room temperature and 45 mg from each hippocampus was collected. For the collected hippocampal tissues, SV Total RNA Isolation System kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was applied in order to isolate and purify the total ribonucleic acid (RNA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions and the protocol previously described [
 <xref rid="B38-antioxidants-09-00919" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. For quantifying the expression of genes of interest, reverse transcription and amplification by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) were performed using a GoTaq
 <sup>®</sup> 1-Step RT-qPCR System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) on a 5-plex HRM Rotor-Gene 6000 (Corbett, CA, USA) real-time PCR. The reaction mixture contained 10 µL GoTaq
 <sup>®</sup> Probe qPCR Master Mix (1X) (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), 0.4 µL GoScript™ RT Mix for 1-Step RT-qPCR (50×), 2µL Forward primer, 2µL Reverse primer, 4 µL RNA solution, and 1.6 µL Nuclease-Free Water.
