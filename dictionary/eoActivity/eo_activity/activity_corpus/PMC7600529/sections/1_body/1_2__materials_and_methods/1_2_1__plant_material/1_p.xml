<p>The aerial flowering parts of 
 <italic>Origanum majorana</italic> L. (Lamiaceae) were collected during August 2019 from green crops within the Agricultural Research and Development Unit of Secuieni, Neamt County, Romania. A voucher specimen was botanically authenticated and preserved for ready reference at the Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Medicine and Pharmacy “Gr. T. Popa”, Iasi, Romania. The essential oil was obtained through 3 h hydro-distillation of fresh plant material using a Clevenger type equipment. Anhydrous sodium sulfate was used to dry the essential oil, removing the water from the distillate. It was then stored in amber vials at a temperature of 4 °C for further examination. The essential oil extraction yield was 0.34% (
