<p>The analysis of the essential oil was done using a gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890N, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) with 5975 inert XL mass selective detector (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and flame ionization detector (GC-FID) equipped with a 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm column (5%-phenyl)-methylpolysiloxane (HP 5MS, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA); the injector temperature was 250–280 °C; increasing 4 grades/min; as mobile phase was used helium 1mL/min; split ratio 1:100; sample volume 0.2 µL. The retention indices (RI) were calculated against hydrocarbon (C4–C40) standards. Identification of the essential compounds was carried out by comparing retention times (RT), retention indices (RI), and mass spectra with those obtained from Wiley libraries [
