<p>For the absolute quantification of two transcripts, BDNF and IL1β, primers with the following sequences were used: BDNF forward and reverse primer (F: 5′-ATT ACC TGG ATG CCG CAA AC-3′; R: 5′-TGA CCC ACT CGC TAA TAC TGT-3′, 101 bp product size) (M98820.1); IL1β forward and reverse primer (F: 5′- AGC ACC TTC TTT TCC TTC ATC TT-3′, R: 5′-CAG ACA GCA GGC ATT TT-3′, 144 bp product size) (M61178.1). The reaction thermic profile consisted of reverse transcription step—15 min (37 °C); RT inactivation/Hot-Start activation—10 min (95 °C); 40 cycles of 3-step qPCR: 10 s (95 °C)—denaturation, 30 s (60 °C)—alignment and data collection (Green channel—BRYT Green
 <sup>®</sup> dye, Madison, WI, USA), 30 s (72 °C)—elongation; and dissociation step (from 60–95 °C). Rotor-Gene Q-Pure Detection Software v. 2.2.3. (Qiagen, CA, USA) was used for absolute quantification of BDNF and IL1β expression levels.
