<p>Three pieces of frozen brain tissue containing the hippocampi (between 238 mg and 321 mg) were used to produce crude protein extracts. Each piece was from one specimen, to represent the experimental groups Aβ (1–42) (II), Aβ (1–42) + 1%OmEO (III), and Aβ (1–42) + 3%OmEO (IV). Each frozen brain tissue piece was thawed for 2 min at room temperature, weighed, and wetted with lysis buffer consisting of 1% sodium deoxycholate (SDC), 20 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (ABC) and protease inhibitor cocktail Complete
 <sup>TM</sup> (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) [
 <xref rid="B39-antioxidants-09-00919" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The added volume of lysis buffer (in µL) with respect to brain tissue weight (in mg) was in the 9:1 ratio, as described [
 <xref rid="B40-antioxidants-09-00919" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Brain tissue pieces and lysis buffer mixtures were transferred into a dounce homogenizer (Kontes Glass Co, Vineland, NJ, USA), and tissues were disrupted within 10 passes. To complete homogenization, suspensions were transferred into new 15 mL Falcon tubes, heated at 95 °C for 5 min in a water bath, followed by double ultra-sonication (Sonorex Super RK 31H, BANDELIN, Berlin, Germany), each for 15 s, interrupted for 2 min. Then, 50 mM ABC was added to each suspension in the same volume as the respective lysis buffer volume to reach a final concentration of 0.5% SDC. Next, the extracts were shaken for 10 min at room temperature and centrifuged at 16,000×

After centrifugation, the supernatants (crude protein extracts; volumes were between 4 mL and 6 mL) were aliquoted into 0.5 mL portions and transferred into new 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes. For protein concentration determination, Bradford assay was used as described [
 <xref rid="B41-antioxidants-09-00919" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], due to its compatibility with reducing agents, such as DTT. Taking aliquots of crude protein extracts (300 µL to 400 µL), the reduced proteins (1 mg, each) were alkylated at room temperature in the dark for 20 min by adding 9 µL to 12 µL of 0.5 M iodoacetamide solution, dissolved in 50 mM ABC. The digestion of reduced and alkylated proteins was then performed overnight at 37 °C by adding 100 µL of trypsin solution (Promega, Madison, WI, USA; dissolved in 50 mM ABC) with an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:100 (

 <xref rid="B42-antioxidants-09-00919" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] was performed as previously described [
 <xref rid="B43-antioxidants-09-00919" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Ethyl acetate (in the same volume as the volume of the respective peptide mixture) and 25% trifluoroacetic acid (1/50 of the respective ethyl acetate volume) were added. The peptide mixtures were rigorously shaken for 2 min and subsequently centrifuged at 12,000× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min to obtain aqueous and organic phases. The aqueous phase of each peptide mixture was collected using a gel loading tip and reduced in volume to final volume of around 100 µL, each using a centrifugal evaporator (Speedvac RVC 2-25 CD plus, Martin Christ GmbH, Osterode am Harz, Germany). The peptide concentrations were measured using the Qubit assay as described [

 <xref rid="B45-antioxidants-09-00919" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Peptide concentrations of desalted peptide solutions were measured using the Qubit assay [
