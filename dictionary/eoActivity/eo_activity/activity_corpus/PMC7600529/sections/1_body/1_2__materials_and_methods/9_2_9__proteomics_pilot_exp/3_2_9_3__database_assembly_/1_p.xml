<p>For the database search, a database containing 29,944 protein sequences of the 
 <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic> proteome (
 <uri xlink:href="http://www.uniprot.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.uniprot.org/</uri>; UniProt release 2020_06) appended with the sequences of ClpB_ECOLI (P63284) and porcine trypsin was used. Mass spectrometric raw data file processing, protein identification, and label-free quantification of identified proteins were performed using the Progenesis QI for Proteomics software package, version 4.1 (Nonlinear Dynamics, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK) as previously described [
 <xref rid="B46-antioxidants-09-00919" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The following search parameters were set: trypsin as digestion reagent, two missing cleavage sites allowed, carbamidomethylation of cysteines as a fixed modification, and oxidation of methionine residues as variable modification. The false discovery rate was set to 1%. At least three fragment ions were required for peptide identification, and at least six fragment ions corresponding to minimally two peptides were required for protein identification. Moreover, for peptide identifications, only peptides with two, three, and four positive charges were accepted if they were identified in at least two of the six measurement series. In addition, the peptides with a peptide score below 5.7, absolute mass error above 13 ppm, and less than 6 amino acid residues in length were excluded.
