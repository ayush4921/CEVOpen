<p>Spatial memory performance was assessed through radial arm maze (RAM) as previously described [
 <xref rid="B53-antioxidants-09-00919" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Before the start of the test, the animals were subjected to a weight loss regime, until the body weight of the animals represented 85% of the initial weight. The food restriction represents an essential factor for an efficient arm-choice within RAM [
 <xref rid="B54-antioxidants-09-00919" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and it has been shown that food-deprived rats performed RAM more efficiently than food-undeprived rats [
 <xref rid="B55-antioxidants-09-00919" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Despite restrictive access to food, the animals had free access to water. The maze comprising eight arms marked from 1 to 8 (48 cm Ã— 12 cm), with a radial extension of 32 cm in diameter from the central area, had 50 mg food pellet at the end of arms 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7. The RAM was started on day 16 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-00919-f001">Figure 1</xref>) and performed in two stages: a training stage (4 consecutive days) aimed at habituation and a testing stage (7 successive days). Each training session lasted 5 min, with groups of 3 or 4 animals being tested. Although in the training days, the food baits were spread all over the maze, in test days, only 5 arms contained baits placed at the end of each arm. To perform the test, each animal was centrally positioned in the maze allowing it to explore the maze and consume the baits from the 5 arms. Behavioral assessment was completed when the animal consumed all 5 baits or after 5 min. An animal was considered to have entered an arm when all four of its members were in that arm. For working memory and reference memory tasks, each rat was individually placed in the center of the maze 15 min after inhaling OmEO (1% and 3%). Determinations were carried out by (i) assessing the number of working memory errors (getting inside an arm that contains food pellet, but earlier stepped into) and (ii) calculating the number of reference memory errors (calculating animal enters in an arm without food pellet). Spatial working memory represents the ability to hold process-specific information for a while, so that spatial responses can be performed flexibly from process to process. This type of memory is the basis of feeding behavior; thus, the subject remembering the arm just visited can adopt an effective search strategy. Spatial reference memory is represented by the ability to learn a consistent, fixed response to a spatial stimulus, being reflected by a constant association between the respective spatial location and an outcome. Thus, the animal will have to learn the position of the three arms not reinforced with baits, these remaining constant [
