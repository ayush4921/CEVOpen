<p>For the assay of the biochemical parameters, the frozen hippocampi were allowed to thaw for 2 min at room temperature upon which they were individually homogenized (1:10) in ice-cold 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 1.15% KCl by using a Potter Homogenizer (Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL, USA). The homogenates were centrifuged at 960×
