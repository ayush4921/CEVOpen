<p>Rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of the sodium pentobarbital solution (50 mg/kg, b.w., i.p., Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) and mounted in a stereotaxic device. An iodine solution (10%, Hach, Loveland, CO, USA) was used to wash the scalp of the animals before midline incision, and then a thin hole (0.75 mm diameter) was drilled (Parkside Microdrill, Germany) in the skull 1.5 mm unilaterally right from the bregma craniometric point. To induce the AD rat model as previously described [

Afterward, a volume of 4 μL of Aβ1-42 solution was intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) delivered for 4 min (flow rate 1 μL/min) by a Hamilton microsyringe 7.4 mm ventral from the surface of the cortex, according to the stereotaxic atlas (

The control animals (sham-operated rats) received 4 μL of 0.9% sterile saline solution instead of the Aβ1-42 solution. Finally, the incisions were sutured, and the animals received a wide-spectrum antibiotic (as powder that was spread along the suture) before being returned to their home cages to recover. Postoperatively, the animals were individually housed in cages for 3 days for incision healing (
