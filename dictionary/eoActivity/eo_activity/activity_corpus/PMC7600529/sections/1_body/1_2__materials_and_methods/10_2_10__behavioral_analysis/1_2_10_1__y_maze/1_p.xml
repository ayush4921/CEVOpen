<p>Spontaneous alternation behavior and hippocampus integrity were assessed through a single session Y-maze as previously described [

 <xref rid="B52-antioxidants-09-00919" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The Y-maze used in the present study was constructed of Plexiglas with the following dimensions: 25 cm high, 35 cm long, 10 cm wide of each arm, and an equilateral triangular central area. Fourteen days post-surgery (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-00919-f001">Figure 1</xref>) and 15 min from OmEO (1% and 3%) inhalation session, each animal was placed at the end of an arm and allowed to explore the maze for 8 min. Successive entry in each arm was interpreted as behavioral alternation. A blinded observer registered visited arms sequence corresponding to each animal. The spontaneous alternation percentage was calculated as (number of alternation/total entries − 2) × 100. Between trials, the Y-maze was washed with a 10% ethanol solution.
