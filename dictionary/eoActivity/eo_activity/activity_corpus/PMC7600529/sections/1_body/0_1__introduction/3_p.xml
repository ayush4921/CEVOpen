<p>Amyloidosis is a condition characterized by the deposition of insoluble proteins in the extracellular space of various tissues. The most frequent types of amyloidosis are related to amyloid β (Aβ) deposition, which is characteristic of neurological conditions such as aging, traumatic brain injuries, or AD [

Yet, nanomolar range concentrations of Aβ1-42 appear to be neurotoxic, involving detrimental effects as impairment of synaptic transmission [

The mechanism underlying Aβ–mediated synaptic dysfunctions is still unclear, but it may be related to the reduction of postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) levels and negative regulation of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamatergic receptors [
 <xref rid="B28-antioxidants-09-00919" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Aβ also contributes to BDNF signaling disruption, impairing neuronal plasticity, thus affecting learning and memory processes [
 <xref rid="B29-antioxidants-09-00919" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Furthermore, Aβ mediates the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that rapidly react with lipids, proteins, or deoxyribonucleic acids (DNA) determining lipid peroxidation, protein, and DNA oxidation [
 <xref rid="B30-antioxidants-09-00919" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Besides, the Aβ peptide induces inflammatory responses through microglial cell activation leading to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which may increase neuronal degeneration and neuronal synapses loss [
