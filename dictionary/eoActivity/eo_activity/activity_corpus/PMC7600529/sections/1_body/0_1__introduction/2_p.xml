 <italic>Origanum majorana</italic> essential oil (OmEO) exerted antidepressant-like effects by modulating noradrenergic, dopaminergic, and serotonergic systems [
 <xref rid="B18-antioxidants-09-00919" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Another group of researchers showed that OmEO alleviated anxiety in bruxistic patients and claimed that this essential oil might represent a safe alternative for benzodiazepine treatment [

 <italic>O. majorana</italic> possesses anti-inflammatory properties [

 <xref rid="B21-antioxidants-09-00919" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] revealed that OmEO exerts anti-inflammatory activity through the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 1β (IL-1β), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in activated macrophages.
