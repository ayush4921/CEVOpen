<p>IL-1β mRNA copy numbers, which are related to inflammatory processes, were found significantly overexpressed in the Aβ1-42 pretreated group (II) vs. the sham-operated group (I) (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0032) (

 <italic>p</italic> = 0.1107 for 1%OmEO (III) and 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0635 for 3%OmEO (IV), respectively).
