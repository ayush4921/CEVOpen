<p>The Y-maze task was utilized to evaluate the short-term memory performance of rats that received different treatments, one-way ANOVA showing significant effects of these on spontaneous alternation behavior (F(3, 16) = 8.27, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0048). Single Aβ1-42 intracerebroventricular administration (II) caused a significant decrease in the spontaneous alternation behavior compared to the sham-operated control group (I) (

However, inhalation of the OmEO in both concentrations enhanced the performance of Aβ1-42 pretreated rats in the Y-maze test, significant improvements of the spontaneous alternation behavior being observed for the Aβ1-42 pretreated rats that inhaled 1%OmEO (III) (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0018), but not for those that inhaled 3%OmEO (IV) (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0950). The changes in the spontaneous alternation behavior cannot be attributed to the locomotor activity, as evidenced by the number of arm entries within the Y-maze task (
