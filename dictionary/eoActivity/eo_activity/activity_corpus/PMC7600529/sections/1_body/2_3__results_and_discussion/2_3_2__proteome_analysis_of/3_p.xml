<p>From the 17 proteins whose expression seemed influenced by OmEO administration (
 <xref rid="antioxidants-09-00919-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), 10 were regarded as representatives of biological processes, such as cognitive function, apoptosis, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress, respectively. These biological functions were further targeted using well established biochemical/molecular assays one after the other (see below). The protein with the accession number Q5XIU9 is involved in adipose tissue development and, although

 <xref rid="B63-antioxidants-09-00919" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], we did not further assess this proteinâ€™s function since the biological process in which it is involved in was not the focus of this study. The remaining six proteins (Q08163, M0RBL8, P31232, P84083, Q5M821, and P01835) were assigned by Funrich to biological processes, such as energy consumption or cell motility. Although they indicated cellular activity in general, e.g., associated with healing processes and cellular regeneration, these functions were not further investigated.
