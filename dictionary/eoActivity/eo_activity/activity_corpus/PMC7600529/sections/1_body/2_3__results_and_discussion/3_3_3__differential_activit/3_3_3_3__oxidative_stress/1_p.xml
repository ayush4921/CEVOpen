<p>To test for oxidative stress responses, evaluation of lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation was targeted. MDA, a secondary product of lipid peroxidation, is involved in multiple cellular processes and can promote intramolecular or intermolecular protein/DNA crosslinking, thus inducing profound alterations in the biochemical properties of a variety of biomolecules [

Protein carbonylation, an irreversible oxidative damage, most often leads to a loss of protein function, but may also lead to gain of function. In both cases, even small changes in carbonylation may determine significant changes in cellular function, affecting major signaling pathways [
