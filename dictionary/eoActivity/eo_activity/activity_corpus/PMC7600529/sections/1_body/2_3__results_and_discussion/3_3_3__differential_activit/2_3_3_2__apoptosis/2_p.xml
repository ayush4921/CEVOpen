<p>DNA fragmentation, associated to apoptotic processes, was found significantly elevated in the AÎ²1-42 pretreated group (II) vs. the sham-operated group (I) (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0008) (

 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0634 for 1%OmEO (III) and 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.1059 for 3%OmEO (IV), respectively).
