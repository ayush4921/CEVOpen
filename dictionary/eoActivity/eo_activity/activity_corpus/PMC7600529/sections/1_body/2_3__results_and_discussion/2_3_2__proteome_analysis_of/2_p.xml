<p>It is tempting to regard the proteins above and below the 2× and 3× threshold lines as being of potential interest (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-00919-f002">Figure 2</xref>). However, considering the low number of animals per group, the abundance differences of those particular proteins should not be overemphasized, as statistical significance cannot be reached. Instead, the listed proteins in sum seemed to point to respective pathways/biological processes of interest, which then were tested for their potential roles with regard to OmEO-related effects by applying well-established functional assays (
