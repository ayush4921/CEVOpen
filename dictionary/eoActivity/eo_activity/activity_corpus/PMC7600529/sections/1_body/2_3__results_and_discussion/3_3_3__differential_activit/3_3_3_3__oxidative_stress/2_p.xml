<p>Aβ1-42 pretreated rats (II) presented a significantly higher levels of MDA and protein carbonyls (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-00919-f005">Figure 5</xref>A,B) compared to the sham-operated rats (I), revealing the potential of Aβ1-42 single administration to induce oxidative stress in entire organ. Next, it was observed that the inhaled OmEO proved to be very efficient in counteracting the induced oxidative stress, significantly reducing MDA levels in Aβ1-42 pretreated rats (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0023 for 1%OmEO and 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0015 for 3%OmEO, respectively) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-00919-f005">Figure 5</xref>B), where only 1%OmEO (III) significantly decreased the protein carbonylation process within the brains of Aβ1-42 pretreated rats (II) (
