<p>When investigating brain-specific reactions onto OmEO-based aromatherapy, a significantly lower number of BDNF mRNA copies were determined in Aβ1-42 pretreated rats (II) compared to the sham-operated rats (I) (

In addition, it was observed that OmEO attenuated the damage induced by Aβ1-42 administration, as judged from a significant increase in BDNF expression being detected in the Aβ1-42 pretreated rats that inhaled the 1% concentration of the essential oil (III) (
