<p>For this project, a data-driven research approach was followed using proteomics to generate an overview regarding the potential molecular effects of OmEO therapy, instead of a solely theory- or hypothesis-driven research approach [

Next, abundance profiles of the Aβ1-42 and 1%OmEO (III) and Aβ1-42 and 3%OmEO (IV) were superimposed to visualize abundance differences. Abundance differences were categorized by the 2× threshold line and the 3× threshold line, respectively. The most abundant 25 proteins and the least abundant 25 proteins were excluded from abundance comparisons.
