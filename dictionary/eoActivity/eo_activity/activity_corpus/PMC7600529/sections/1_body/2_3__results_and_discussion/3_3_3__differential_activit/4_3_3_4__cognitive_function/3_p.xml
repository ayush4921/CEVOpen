<p>The impact of Aβ peptide on BDNF expression has been previously investigated by us [

 <xref rid="B90-antioxidants-09-00919" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>] and, as also shown in this study, BDNF expression was found impaired upon intracerebroventricular Aβ1-42 delivery. More importantly, this study provides direct evidence of the beneficial effect of OmEO inhalation regarding BDNF expression in an AD-rat model.
