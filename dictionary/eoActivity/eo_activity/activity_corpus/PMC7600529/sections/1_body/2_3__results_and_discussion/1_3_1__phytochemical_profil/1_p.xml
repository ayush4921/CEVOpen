<p>Using GC-FID and GC-MS, 37 chemical compounds were identified in the freshly prepared OmEO (altogether, about 94.34% of the volatiles) (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-antioxidants-09-00919">Supplemental File 2</xref>). The chemical constituents identified included monoterpenes (90.42%), whereas sesquiterpenes (7.92%) were minor components. The analysis of OmEO showed terpinen-4-ol (23.52%), sabinene (12.59%), terpinolene (8.72%), linalool (5.94%), β-thujene (4.60%), phellandrene (4.35%), and α-terpineol (4.30%) as the most abundant volatile components. Based on these findings, our essential oil exhibits a chemical composition equal to those documented by other authors [
