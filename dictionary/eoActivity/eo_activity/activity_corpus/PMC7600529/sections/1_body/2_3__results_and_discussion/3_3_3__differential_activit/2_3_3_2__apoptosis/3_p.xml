<p>Brain DNA damage naturally occurs during aging and exacerbates in different pathologies, such as AD. As shown in this study, Aβ1-42 administered to rats determined increased DNA fragmentation, indicating increased apoptosis. However, the specific intracellular signaling pathways by which Aβ triggers the apoptotic processes are poorly defined, even though several pathways were already proposed [

 <xref rid="B78-antioxidants-09-00919" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. From our results, we deduce that OmEO ameliorated only to some extent the fragmentation of DNA. Therefore, the anti-apoptotic properties of OmEO cannot be asserted with statistical significance. Hence, we further investigated the efficiency of OmEO in counteracting other biological processes, such as oxidative stress as well as cognitive function (
