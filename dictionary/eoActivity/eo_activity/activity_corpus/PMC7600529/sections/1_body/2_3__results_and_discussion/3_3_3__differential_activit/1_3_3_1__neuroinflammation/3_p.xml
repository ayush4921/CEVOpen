<p>The IL-1β overexpression in response to experimentally induced neurotoxic stimuli is well documented [
 <xref rid="B69-antioxidants-09-00919" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]; thus, the increased expression of IL-1β induced by Aβ1-42 stands in general agreement with previous results. Furthermore, anti-inflammatory properties of OmEO were already mentioned in literature and sustained by in vitro studies [
 <xref rid="B21-antioxidants-09-00919" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Yet, our in vivo study found the potential of OmEO to reduce inflammation to be questionable as statistical significance was not reached.
