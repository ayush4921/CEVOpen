<p>In this study, we first confirmed the chemical composition of OmEO, which was applied for analyzing the proteomes of AD model rats, in search of differences that might be displayed on the molecular level. Through this approach, four biological processes—neuroinflammation, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and cognitive functions modulated by neurotrophins—were brought to attention as possibly affecting rat brain (hippocampi) performance as a likely consequence of OmEO administration. Whether or not the suggested biological processes were of significance was validated by testing matching targets, which are accepted representatives of the biological processes of interest. In this study, we found that OmEO promotes cognitive functions and reduces brain oxidative stress in Aβ1-42-treated rats. Finally, we correlated the cellular and molecular results with behavioral data, proving that OmEO enhances memory function in Aβ1-42-treated rats.</p>
