  <italic>Origanum</italic> L. (Lamiaceae) is an important genus of medicinal and aromatic plants used in traditional medicine since ancient times as culinary herbs and remedies. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the chemical composition, as well as the biochemical and cellular activities of freshly prepared 
  <italic>Origanum majorana</italic> L. essential oil (OmEO) in an Alzheimer’s disease (AD) amyloid beta1-42 (Aβ1-42) rat model. OmEO (1% and 3%) was inhaled for 21 consecutive days, while Aβ1-42 was administered intracerebroventricularly to induce AD-like symptoms. Our data demonstrate that OmEO increased antioxidant activity and enhanced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression, which in concert contributed to the improvement of cognitive function of animals. Moreover, OmEO presented beneficial effects on memory performance in Y-maze and radial arm-maze tests in the Aβ1-42 rat AD model.
