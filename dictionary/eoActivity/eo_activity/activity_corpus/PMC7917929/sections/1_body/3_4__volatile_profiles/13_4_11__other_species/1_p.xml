<p>Although 10 
 <italic>Psidium</italic> species have been widely studied with two or more essential oils or volatile concentrates samples, about 8 species were registered concerning their leaf oil compositions. These records were from Brazil and Cuba, with four oils in each country. The species that included only monoterpene constituents were 
 <italic>P. acutangulum</italic> DC. with α-pinene 14.8%, 1,8-cineole 12.9%, β-pinene 10.1% [
