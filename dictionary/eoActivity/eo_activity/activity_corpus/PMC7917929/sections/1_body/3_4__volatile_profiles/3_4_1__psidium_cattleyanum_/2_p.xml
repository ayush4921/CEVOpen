<p>The variability of EO composition of ten accessions of 
 <italic>P. cattleyanum</italic> (nine from leaves and one from fruits) were classified into different chemical profiles. In all samples, at least one constituent with caryophyllane skeleton was identified. Three profiles of leaves oils were characterized only by caryophyllane-type constituents: 
 <italic>E</italic>-caryophyllene (31.5%) in profile I from French Polynesia [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-26-00965" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]; 
 <italic>E</italic>-caryophyllene (59.9%) and caryophyllene oxide (5.4%) in profile II from USA [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-26-00965" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]; 
 <italic>E</italic>-caryophyllene (59.6%), caryophyllene oxide (18.2%) and 
 <italic>Z</italic>-caryophyllene (6.4%) in profile III from south Brazil [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-26-00965" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Profile IV oil from the USA was rich in 
 <italic>E</italic>-caryophyllene (59.0%), followed by acyclic monoterpenes, such as α-pinene (13.2%) and myrcene (11.3%), respectively [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-00965" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Profile V oil from southeastern Brazil was characterized by the 
 <italic>E</italic>-caryophyllene (23.4%), caryophyllene oxide (11.5%), and α-pinene (11.3%) [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-00965" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Profile VI oil from Egypt was rich in 
 <italic>E</italic>-caryophyllene (28.8%), α-pinene (28.0%), myrcene (13.4%), and trans-β-ocimene (5.3%) [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-26-00965" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].
