<p>As a result of a higher life expectancy, after the 1940s Mexico experienced a great demographic expansion going hand in hand with economic growth (

The Mexican Ministry of Health and Welfare (SSA) together with the Institute of Social Security (Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social; IMSS) started to provide family planning counseling and contraceptive services free of charge through their national networks in 1973 (

During the 1970s and until 1982 the political administrations expanded the Mexican health sector by increasing the number of hospitals, clinics and medical staff. This initiative included the establishment of over 3,000 rural health posts, 71 rural hospitals and trainee programs for community health workers including traditional midwifes. As a consequence, the family planning services reached communities and individuals that were not formally considered by the social security system (

This data was used as a baseline for launching programs aimed at reducing morbidity and mortality culminating in a decrease of digestive infections, less malnutrition and better assistance during gestation, birth and postpartum period (

In Guatemala in particular and Central America in general, emerging civil armed conflicts at the end of the 1960s, lasting into the 1990s, prevented health programs to comprehensively address the needs and reach out to the rural population, aggravating health disparities (
