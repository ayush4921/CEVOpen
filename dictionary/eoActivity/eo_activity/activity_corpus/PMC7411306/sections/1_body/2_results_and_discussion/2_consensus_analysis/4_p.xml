<p>According to the WHO guidelines for the assessment of herbal medicines (
 <xref rid="B474" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 1996</xref>, p. 181) a principle for the safety assessment of herbal medicines should be the traditional use of the product “without demonstrated harm” while “no specific restrictive regulatory action should be undertaken unless new evidence demands a revised risk-benefit assessment.” Yet even though a track record of traditional medical use can provide some evidence about the safety of herbal drugs and their applications it is necessary to point out that ‘natural’ is not to be confounded with safe, a common misconception among consumers of herbal drugs (
