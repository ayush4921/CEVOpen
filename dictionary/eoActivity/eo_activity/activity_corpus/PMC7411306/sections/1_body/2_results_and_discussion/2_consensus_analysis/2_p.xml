<p>Typically, many of the herbal drugs used against diarrhea (D) are rich in tannins and polyphenols (
 <xref rid="B221" ref-type="bibr">Heinrich, 1998</xref>), such as the bark of 
 <italic>Byrsonima crassifolia, Guazuma ulmifolia</italic>, and 
 <italic>Mangifera</italic>
 <italic>indica</italic>, leaves of 
 <italic>Psidium guajava</italic> and 
 <italic>Mangifera</italic>
 <italic>indica</italic>, unripe fruits of 
 <italic>Musa × paradisiaca</italic> and fruit skin of

 <italic>granatum.</italic> Those used altogether for gastrointestinal plain, cramps and diarrhea such as the leaves of 
 <italic>Eryngium foetidum</italic> and 
 <italic>Litsea</italic>
 <italic>glaucescens</italic>, the herb of 
 <italic>Artemisia absinthium</italic>, the root of 
 <italic>Cissampelos pareira</italic> and the zest of 
 <italic>Citrus aurantiifolia</italic> are aromatic and/or bitter tasting drugs. Those herbal drugs effective and safe used for category ‘A’ fall under the sub-category of ‘general pain’, ‘weakness’ and ‘feeling ill’ (ICPC) and include those herbal species also used in ritual healing. These are often aromatic, essential oil-bearing plants such as 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic>, 
 <italic>O. campechianum</italic>, 
 <italic>Tagetes lucida</italic> or 
 <italic>Piper amalago</italic>. The ritual cleansing ceremony called “limpia” using aromatic herbs and lotions to brush away bad spirits from the patient is a typical therapeutic practice in MA (
 <xref rid="B495" ref-type="bibr">Zamora-Martínez and Pascual Pola, 1992</xref>). The leaves of 
 <italic>Ocimum</italic> spp. are used either as an infusion or applied topically against headache (N) while the flowers and zest of 
 <italic>Citrus sinensis</italic> and 
 <italic>C. aurantium</italic> serve as infusions to treat anxiety and stress (P). The practice of using essential oil rich herbal drugs for treating the ICPC categories A, P and N remind of aromatherapy, which has been found effective in clinical trials focusing on stress and anxiety related disorders (

 <italic>Sechium edule</italic> (chayote) among
