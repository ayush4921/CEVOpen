<p>The determination of antioxidant activity was performed for each sample of yoghurt. For all these samples, there were 10 spectrophotometer readings, because from each type of yoghurt we made five samples (five containers of 100 g each). After extracting the necessary compounds to determine the antioxidant activity of each extracted container we took two readings. We wanted to eliminate all errors related to equipment, human error and differences in temperature or humidity. All readings were made on the same day of the analysis, to be more exact on the first day, on the 10th day and on the 20th day after the yoghurt samples were made.</p>
