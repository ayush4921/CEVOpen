In this case, we used yoghurt as a representative product for consumers, both in terms of favorable intake for the harmonious development of the body at different stages of life, but also in terms of frequency of consumption. Enriching it with bioactive components extracted from native herbs mint, basil, fennel and lavender, respectively, by adding volatile oils extracted from these plants and encapsulated using 2% sodium alginate, proved to be a beneficial option to increase the value of the product. The use of sodium alginate capsules also solved the problem of ensuring the stability of the volatile oils added to the food. The statistically processed results demonstrate the validity of the method of obtaining valuable food products, enriched in bioactive components, respectively, of using volatile oils with antioxidant and antimicrobial activity. The amount of volatile oils extracted from mint, basil, fennel and lavender is dependent on the growing conditions, soil and climatic conditions, the extraction method used, but the average values obtained support the potential for their use, especially in terms of the benefits for consumers’ health.
