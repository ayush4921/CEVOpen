<p>To determine whether the time of administration would influence the effect of EOHc on carrageenan-induced edema, in another experimental series, EOHc (100 mg/kg) or vehicle was administered 60 and 30 min before, at the time of induction, or 30 min after edema induction. The paw edema was evaluated at 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, 1440 (24 h), and 2880 (48 h) min after edema induction.</p>
