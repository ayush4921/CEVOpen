<p>The EOHc was obtained from leaves and branches of 
 <italic>H. crenata</italic> by steam distillation (Detiller MA480, Marconi
 <sup>®</sup>, Brazil) as described for other essential oils (

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The plant was collected (January 2011) in the city of São Raimundo das Mangabeiras, Maranhão State, Brazil (7° 1′ 19- S, 45° 28′ 51- W). The identification was confirmed by Dr. Oriel Herera Bonilla (Ecology Laboratory, Brazil) and a voucher sample (No. 000106) was deposited at the Marlene Freitas da Silva herbarium (Brazil). Chemical constituents of the EOHc were kindly determined by Dr. Afrânio Aragão Craveiro from Technological Development Park of the Federal University of Ceará (PADETEC/UFC), by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS, Hewlett-Packard 6971, USA). Analysis conditions were as follows: column of dimethylpolysiloxane DB-1 fused silica capillary column (30 m×0.25 mm; 0.1 μm); helium (1 mL/min) as carrier gas; injector temperature: 250°C; detector temperature: 200°C; column temperature: 35-180°C at 4°C/min and 180-250°C at 10°C/min; and mass spectra: electronic impact 70 eV. The compounds were identified (
