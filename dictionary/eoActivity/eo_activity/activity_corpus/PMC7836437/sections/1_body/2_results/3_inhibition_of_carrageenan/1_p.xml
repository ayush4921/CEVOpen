<p>EOHc also had an inhibitory effect on edema induced by carrageenan (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Figure 3A and B</xref>). For the dose of 10 mg/kg, this effect started from the 2nd h and was maintained throughout of the observation period. At the doses of 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg the inhibition started earlier, from 30 min. At the edema peak, 180 min, the paw volume inhibition corresponded to 56, 76, and 82% of the paw volume increase by carrageenan (130±5.1099 µL) for doses of 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg, respectively. Indomethacin (positive control) inhibited 84.5% of peak control edema.
