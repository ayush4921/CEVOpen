<p>EOHc (100 and 300 mg/kg) had inhibitory effect on edema induced by bradykinin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f04">Figure 4C and F</xref>) observed at 10, 20, and 30 min after injection of bradykinin. At the peak of edema, at the 20th min after bradykinin administration, the inhibition of paw volume corresponded to 57.34±6.54 and 61.1±4.13% (EOHc 100 and 300 mg/kg, respectively) of the increase in paw volume by bradykinin (100.8±5.43 µL).
