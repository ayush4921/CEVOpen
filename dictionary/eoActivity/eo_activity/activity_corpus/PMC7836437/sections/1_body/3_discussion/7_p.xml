<p>Since the inflammation induced by dextran involves the release of inflammatory mediators histamine and serotonin and carrageenan also involves bradykinins, the anti-inflammatory effect of EOHc implies at least a partial antagonistic effect of this EO to the edematogenic effect of these inflammatory mediators. This partial antagonistic effect of EOHc to the edematogenic activity of histamine, serotonin, and bradykinin was demonstrated here (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f05">Figure 5</xref>). EOHc inhibitory activity on the edema and MPO activity increase elicited by edematogenic stimuli demonstrated the true anti-inflammatory mechanism of this EO. Although the blockade by EOHc of the edema induced by histamine and serotonin was partial, at 100 and 300 mg/kg, EOHc effect was similar to those of cyproheptadine and indomethacin (
