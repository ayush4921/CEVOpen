<p>The induction of edema by phlogistic agents, such as dextran or carrageenan, is a classical model that allows evaluating substances with anti-inflammatory action. The EOHc showed an antiedematogenic effect in both models, which cause edema by distinct mechanisms. Dextran and carrageenan promote an increase in vascular permeability by different mechanisms. Therefore, analyzing this set of results, it is possible to suggest that EOHc possesses activity on vascular events of inflammation, possibly by inhibition of histamine and serotonin release by mast cells or by neutrophils, and/or by inhibition of action of these substances on receptors (
