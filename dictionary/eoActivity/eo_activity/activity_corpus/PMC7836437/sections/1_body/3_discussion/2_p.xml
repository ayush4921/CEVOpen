<p>Some EO of aromatic plants have antiedematogenic effects, such as 
 <italic>C. zehntneri</italic> EO (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), 
 <italic>Lavanda augustifolia</italic> EO (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), and 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> EO (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). However, it is worth mentioning that for EOHc, the antiedematogenic effect occurs with very small doses (10 mg/kg), representing &lt;0.5% of the LD
 <sub>50</sub> (LD
 <sub>50</sub> &gt;2.0 g/kg, orally (
 <xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)). Moreover, efficacy with such a small percentage of the LD
 <sub>50</sub> was not observed for several other EOs, such as 
 <italic>Lavandula augustifolia</italic> Mill EO (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) and 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> EO (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).
