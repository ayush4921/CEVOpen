<p>The values of the heat‐sealing strength of PE films coated with different concentrations of carvacrol and menthol are summarized in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32240-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. As can be seen in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32240-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, the use of coatings containing different levels of carvacrol and menthol did not have a statistically significant effect on the heat‐sealing strength of PE film. The average values of the heat‐sealing strength of PE films ranged of 636.36 to 638.96 N/m.
