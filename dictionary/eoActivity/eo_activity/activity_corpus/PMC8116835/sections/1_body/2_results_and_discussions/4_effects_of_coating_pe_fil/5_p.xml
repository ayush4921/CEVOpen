<p>Some researchers believe that incorporating hydrophobic active compounds (such as essential oils) into polymer films can reduce the rate of water transfer by reducing the effect of plasticizers (Giteru et al.,

 <xref rid="fsn32240-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) also stated that increasing carvacrol levels in chitosan film samples significantly reduced the WVP of films. Jutaporn et al., (
 <xref rid="fsn32240-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>) similarly observed that with increasing the concentration of Phayom wood extract in the film, the WVP increased significantly, which was due to structural changes in the polymer film. Decreased WVP rate of sago starch‐guar gum due to the incorporation of carvacrol and citral in the active films was also reported by Dhumal et al., (
