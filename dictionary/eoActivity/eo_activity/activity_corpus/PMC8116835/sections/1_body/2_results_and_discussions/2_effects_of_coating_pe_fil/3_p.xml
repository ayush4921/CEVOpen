<p>The results of the EB amounts of the coated PE films (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32240-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b) also indicated that by coating the PE films with different levels of carvacrol and menthol, a significant increase in the EB of produced films was observed (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt;.05). Thus, the control had the least amount of EB (21.80%), and with increasing the concentration of carvacrol and menthol in the coating, the amount of this mechanical index increased significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt;.05). The highest amount of EB is related to the film coated with a solution containing 2% menthol (45.80%).
