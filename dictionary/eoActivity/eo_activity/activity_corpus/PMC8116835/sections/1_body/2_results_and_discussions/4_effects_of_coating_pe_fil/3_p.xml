<p>One of the most important characteristics of food packaging is its permeability to water vapor, which is due to the important role of water in destructive reactions and the growth of microorganisms. Water acts as a solvent or carrier and causes texture decomposition and chemical and enzymatic reactions. High relative humidity is one of the main causes of food spoilage. Therefore, the water vapor barrier is one of the important properties of polymers used for food packaging.</p>
