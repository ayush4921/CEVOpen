<p>The average values of the tensile strength (ST) and elongation at break (EB) of different coated PE films are shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32240-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a, b, respectively. As the results show (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32240-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), the highest ST was related to the control film (27.95 MPa), and coating of PE films with different levels of carvacrol and menthol led to a significant reduction in the ST of produced films (
