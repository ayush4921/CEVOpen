<p>Dashipour et al., (
 <xref rid="fsn32240-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) stated that the CMC film is completely transparent and colorless, and the addition of clove essential oil to this film reduced the lightness of the produced films, and the a* index decreased, but the b* color index increased. Pastor et al., (
 <xref rid="fsn32240-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>) also found that the addition of propolis extract to the hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) reduced the brightness of films. The decreased light intensity of sago starch‐guar gum films due to the adding of carvacrol and citral in these films was also reported by Dhumal, Ahmed, et al., (
