<p>Mechanical properties (such as tensile strength and elongation at break) are important factors in food packaging. Tensile strength indicates the maximum tensile force that the film can withstand, and the amount of elongation at break indicates the maximum change in the length of the test sample before breaking (Pereda et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32240-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). The mechanical properties of films are influenced by several factors, including the interactions between film compositions, temperature, physical, and chemical conditions (Sánchez‐González et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32240-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). The change in the uniformity of the film network structure due to hydrophobic properties of carvacrol and menthol is the reason for the decrease in tensile strength and the increase in elongation percentage of films containing high levels of these active compounds.
