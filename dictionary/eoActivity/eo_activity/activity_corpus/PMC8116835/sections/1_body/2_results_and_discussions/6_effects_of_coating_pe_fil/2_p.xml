<p>The color of films used in food packaging is very important because of their effects on food consumer acceptance. The color indexes of different samples of PE coated with different levels of carvacrol and menthol were measured by the Hunterlab, and the values of the indexes obtained are given in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn32240-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The results showed that the highest L* index was related to the control film (68.71), and the coating of PE film with different concentrations of carvacrol and menthol caused a significant decrease in the L* index (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt;.05). The lowest L* value was obtained in film coated with a solution containing 2% carvacrol (57.07), but there was not a statistically significant difference between this film and films coated with 1.5% and 2% menthol. Decreased brightness of PE films due to the use of carvacrol and menthol coatings is due to the color of these compounds. On the other hand, due to the hydrophobicity of carvacrol and menthol, probably due to the use of these compounds, the moisture content of the film is reduced, and the color brightness is also reduced.
