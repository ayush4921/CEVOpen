<p>In general, essential oils and plant extracts with hydrophobic compounds can interact with the lipid structure of bacterial, mitochondrial cell membranes, and other intracellular compounds, causing cell structure destruction, ion exchange, preventing respiration and increase permeability, leakage of intracellular compounds, and bacterial cell death (Devi et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32240-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). The antimicrobial mechanisms of action of carvacrol have been previously investigated and found to be due to the interaction of hydrophobic compounds with bacterial membranes. This interference causes changes in the permeability of H
 <sup>+</sup> and K
 <sup>+</sup> and causes the destruction of basic functions and cell death (Ultee et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32240-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). A gradual release of active molecules into food packaged in active packaging allows these active ingredients to always be available and exert their antimicrobial activity effect in the long run (Amalraj et al.,
