<p>The microbial growth curve has four phases, including the lag phase, log phase, fixed growth phase, and death phase. In the lag phase, the cell adapts to the new environment and does not increase in number. In the log phase, microorganisms consume food, and their number increases exponentially and logarithmically. In the stage of constant growth, the rate of production is equal to the rate of death, and in the last stage, the number of microorganisms is declining. This stage is also called the self‐destructive phase. If a compound has antimicrobial properties, it can both delay the lag phase and reduce the maximum population of microorganisms in the log phase.
