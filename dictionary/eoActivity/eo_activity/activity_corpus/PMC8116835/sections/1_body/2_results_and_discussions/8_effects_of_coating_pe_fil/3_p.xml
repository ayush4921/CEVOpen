<p>The results demonstrated that with increasing the concentration of carvacrol and menthol in the coating, microbial growth kinetics decreased. The lower the microbial growth kinetics, the greater the inhabitation, as the lag phase increases and the log phase decreases. In other words, the active compounds (carvacrol and menthol) kill microorganisms by slowing down the growth rate and prolonging the lag phase of microorganisms or inactivating them. According to the obtained results, the highest level of inhabitation against various microorganisms studied in this study was related to films coated with 2% carvacrol and 2% menthol.</p>
