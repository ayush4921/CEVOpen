<p>Based on research conducted by various researchers, the addition of high levels of antimicrobial compounds to various polymers due to changes in molecular level changes the mechanical properties of films produced from these polymers. These changes cause the destruction of the film network and, in most cases, act to reduce the resistance of the films to stretching (Chen et al.,

 <xref rid="fsn32240-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>) observed that with increasing concentration of lemon essential oil (from 0.05% to 1%), the tensile strength of films decreased, which was consistent with the results of the present study. However, the addition of cinnamon essential oil at similar levels reduced the strength of the films. These researchers said that the difference in the performance of different compounds was due to differences in the polarity of added compounds. Another study also reported that the addition of black pepper and ginger essential oils to composite films increased tensile strength and reduced flexibility of film (Amalraj et al.,
