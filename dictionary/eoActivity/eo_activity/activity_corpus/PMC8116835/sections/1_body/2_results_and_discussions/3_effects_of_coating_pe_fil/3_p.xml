<p>In general, the heat‐sealing capability of a material is important for its use in the food packaging industry. Heat sealing is the process of sealing a flexible film to another similar film under heat and pressure. The quality of heat sealing depends on process conditions such as sealing methods, temperature, pressure, time (sealing time and cooling time), type of film materials, and treatments. Regardless of the various parameters for the quality of heat sealing, the resulting seal must be strong enough to maintain the integrity of the package. This seal must have high mechanical strength to be able to protect the packaged products (López et al.,
