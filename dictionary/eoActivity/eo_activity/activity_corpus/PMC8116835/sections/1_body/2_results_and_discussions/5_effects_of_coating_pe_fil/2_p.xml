<p>Oxygen permeability of packaging materials plays an important role in food preservation because oxygen is a key factor in oxidation reactions and several other destructive reactions (Sothornvit &amp; Pitak, 
 <xref rid="fsn32240-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). The permeability of films to oxygen depends on the crystallinity of the films so that as the crystallinity increases, the permeability of films to gasses (oxygen and carbon dioxide) decreases (Miller &amp; Krochta, 
 <xref rid="fsn32240-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">1997</xref>). Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32240-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b shows the values of OP of different PE films. The results demonstrated that coating PE film with different levels of carvacrol and menthol led to an increase in the OP of films, and with increasing the level of these additives in samples, a significant increase in the OP values of films was observed (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt;.05). The OP value in the control sample was 2,199 cc‐mil/m
 <sup>2</sup>.day and in the films coated with the highest levels of carvacrol and menthol increased by 2,262 and 2,286 cc‐mil/m
 <sup>2</sup>.day, respectively. This increase in permeability due to the use of carvacrol and menthol in the PE film coating is probably due to the change in the structure of the films and the increase in the holes in them, which increases the permeability of the films to oxygen. Altiok et al., (
 <xref rid="fsn32240-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>) also observed an increase in oxygen permeability due to the addition of thyme essential oil to the chitosan film. In another study, an increase in the oxygen permeability of edible films was reported due to the addition of high levels of grape seed extract and carvacrol (Rubilar et al.,
