<p>Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32240-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref> shows the amounts of UV‐Visible spectra passing through the PE films coated with different concentrations of carvacrol and menthol. The light transmittance of PE films in the wavelength range of 200–800 nm was in the range of 0.005% to 89.22%. At all wavelengths studied in this study (visible and ultraviolet), the coating of PE films with different levels of carvacrol and menthol reduced the amount of light transmission. These results indicate that carvacrol and menthol block the passage of visible and UV light from the film to the product. With the increasing concentration of these two additives, the amount of light transmission gradually decreased.
