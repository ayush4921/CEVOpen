<p>Water vapor transfer is generally done through the hydrophilic part of the film and therefore depends on the ratio of hydrophilicity to the hydrophobicity of film compounds (Giteru et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32240-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Various factors such as the ratio of hydrophilic to hydrophobic groups and curvature and fracture in the film structure affect the amount of water vapor permeability (Wong et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32240-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">1992</xref>). The reduction in water vapor permeability of PE films, likely related to the hydrophobicity nature of carvacrol and menthol.
