<p>Olasupo et al., (
 <xref rid="fsn32240-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>) reported that the minimum concentration of carvacrol required to inhibit the growth of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (1.5 mmol/L) was greater than the concentration required to inhibit the growth of 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> (1 mmol/L), and this indicates that 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> is more sensitive to carvacrol than 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. Yuan et al., (
 <xref rid="fsn32240-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>) observed that the chitosan film had no antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus,</italic> and with the addition of carvacrol and pomegranate peel extract, the antimicrobial activity against this bacterium increased, and the inhibitory effect of carvacrol on 
 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> was significantly greater than that of pomegranate peel extract.
