 <xref rid="fsn32240-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a compares the average values of WVP of PE films coated with different concentrations of carvacrol and menthol. It shows that the highest WVP amount was obtained in the control film (11.93 g/msPa), and coating of the PE film with different levels of carvacrol and menthol reduced the WVP amounts of the films (
