<p>The optical properties of polymers are related to the degree of crystallinity and their main structure. Decreased transparency of polymers is achieved as a result of reflection, absorption, and scattering of light. The reflection index, reflection coefficient, and scattering coefficient affect the transparency of the film and the amount of light transmission. Therefore, the degree of crystallinity, crystal size, molecular weight, and molecular structure plays an important role in the optical properties of polymers (Ghadermazi et al.,

 <xref rid="fsn32240-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) added basil and lemon essential oils to the gelatin edible films and found that control sample and films containing essential oils did not absorb at 200 nm. However, the light absorption of films containing essential oils at wavelengths less than 280 nm was much lower than the control. The researchers also reported that combining essential oils into films significantly reduced the percentage of light transmission.
