<p>Water vapor permeability was measured according to ASTM Standard E96/E96 M‐16 (ASTM, 
 <xref rid="fsn32240-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>) by a desiccator containing magnesium nitrate supersaturated solution. The test method was that small glass vials were selected, and 3 g of anhydride calcium chloride was poured into each vial, and the glass surface was covered with films and clamps. Due to the absorbent moisture of anhydride calcium chloride, the relative humidity of the interior of the glass vial and the below the film was zero percent. After initial weight, all samples were transferred simultaneously to a desiccator containing magnesium nitrate salt, which generates 55% humidity at laboratory temperature. Changes in the weight of glassware over time were measured using a digital scale to accurately 0.001 g, and the graph of weight changes versus time was drawn, and the slope of the resulting line was used for calculations.
