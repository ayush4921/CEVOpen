<p>A coating solution was prepared from methylcellulose (MC) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC). 7 g MC and 3 g HPMC were slowly added to 200 cc of 95% ethanol and heated on a hot plate with a magnetic stirrer. When the temperature reached 65ᵒC, heating was stopped. Simultaneously with stirring, the mixture of polyethylene glycol and 100 cc of distilled water, as a plasticizer, was added to the cooled mixture of MC‐HPMC (Rardniyom,

Then, carvacrol and menthol were added to the coating solution at different concentrations so that the coating materials containing antimicrobial agents were obtained at the final levels of 0, 1.0, 1.5, and 2% w/w. The resulting coating solution was applied to the PE film using a roller, and then, the films were dried under normal conditions (Cooksey,

The addition of antimicrobial agents and coating of films prepared at low temperatures was done to minimize the loss of antimicrobial agents due to their volatility.
