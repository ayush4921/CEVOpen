<p>In order to evaluate the sealing capability of the films, heat sealability was measured according ASTM‐F88 method (ASTM, 
 <xref rid="fsn32240-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Two layers of film (2 cm) were placed on top of each other and sewn together by a thermal sewing machine with a temperature of 10 ᵒC and the same sewing time. A stripe of films measuring 1 and 4 cm was prepared. While the distance between the two jaws of the machine was defined as 20 mm, the trip was stretched at a speed of 10 mm/min until the film was torn, and the sealing strength was measured by a texture analyzer and was reported in Newton per meter (N/m).
