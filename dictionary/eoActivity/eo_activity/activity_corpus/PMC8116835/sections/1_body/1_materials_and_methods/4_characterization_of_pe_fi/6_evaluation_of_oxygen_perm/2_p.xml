<p>In order to investigate the oxygen permeability of PE films, the ASTM Standard Method D3985‐17 and a Mocon Oxtran 2/21 system (Minneapolis, USA) were used (ASTM,

 <xref rid="fsn32240-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">1996</xref>). Film samples were conditioned at a temperature of 25ᵒC, atmospheric pressure, and relative humidity of 55% for 48 hr, and then, their thickness was measured and mounted into the diffusion cell of the equipment. By using the convergent method, OP of the films was estimated by WinPermTM permeability software.
