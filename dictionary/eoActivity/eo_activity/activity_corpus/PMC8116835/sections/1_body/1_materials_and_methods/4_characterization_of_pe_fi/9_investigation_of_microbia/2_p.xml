 <xref rid="fsn32240-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). In this study, bacteria grown in 100 ml of Mueller Hinton Broth (for one night) were used. 2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> CFU/mL of each bacterium was added to 100 ml of Mueller Hinton Broth and incubated for 12 hr at 37 ᵒC. Every 2 hr, the absorbance changes were read by spectrophotometer UV/Vis at a wavelength of 600 nm, and bacterial growth was obtained. All steps of the test were repeated 3 times, and the mean values were used.
