<p>In order to investigate the mechanical properties of PE film samples based on ASTM Standard Method E96‐05 (ASTM, 
 <xref rid="fsn32240-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>) with some modification, first, the film strips were cut to a length of 10 mm and a width of 20 mm and was exposed to ambient temperature and relative humidity of about 50% for 2 days. Then, a texture analyzer (TA.XT2, Stable Micro System, Surrey, UK) was used to measure the mechanical properties of the film (tensile strength and elongation at break). The initial velocity separation and cross‐head were selected as 50 mm and 30 mm/min, respectively, and the tensile strength at the point of rupture from the deformation and the force recorded by the software were calculated.
