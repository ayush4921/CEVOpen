<p>Active packaging is a new and interesting packaging in the food industry that increases the shelf life of packed products by increasing food safety and maintaining their quality during the storage period (Hosseini et al.,

This type of packaging system usually uses active ingredients derived from natural sources that have antioxidant and/or antimicrobial activities (Lukic et al.,

However, in order to prepare active packing from synthetic polymers, bioactive compounds cannot be used directly in the production stages of these polymers because the performance of these active agents is reduced due to the high temperatures used for processing. One of the methods used for this problem often involves the use of carriers for bioactive agents, which through these carriers, bioactive compounds can be placed on the surface of synthetic polymers (Jafarzadeh et al.,
