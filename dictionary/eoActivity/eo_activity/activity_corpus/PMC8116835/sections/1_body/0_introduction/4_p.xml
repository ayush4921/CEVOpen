<p>In recent years, much attention has been paid to the isolation and use of new bioactive compounds with antioxidant and/or antimicrobial activities from plant sources (Daneshzadeh et al.,

 <xref rid="fsn32240-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>), the antimicrobial activity of carvacrol against a wide range of food pathogens and spoilage microorganisms was investigated and confirmed. The researchers found that the antimicrobial activity of carvacrol is due to its effects on the structure and function of the microbial cytoplasmic membranes.
