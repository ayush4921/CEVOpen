<p>Polyethylene film was coated with active antimicrobial compounds of peppermint extract (menthol) and thyme extract (carvacrol). The use of carvacrol and menthol in the coating solution used to coat PE film improved the flexibility and water vapor permeability properties of produced films. Due to the coating of PE films with these active compounds, the barrier properties of the films against the UV‚ÄêVisible spectra transmission were improved. Coated PE films with high concentrations of carvacrol and menthol showed good antimicrobial activity against microorganisms studied in this research. In general, the results obtained in this study indicate that PE film coated with carvacrol and menthol can be used as an active food packaging with significant antimicrobial activity in the food packaging industry. In order to accurately understand the effect of carvacrol and menthol on the antimicrobial activity of PE films, further research is needed to investigate their release rate at different times and under different conditions.</p>
