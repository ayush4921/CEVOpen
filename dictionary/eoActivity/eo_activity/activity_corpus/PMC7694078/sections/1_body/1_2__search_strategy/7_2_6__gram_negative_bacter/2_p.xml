<p>Investigation of the growth inhibitory effect of an oil from mānuka seeds against 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> showed it to be ineffective according to Jeong et al. (2009) while it was effective for Prosser et al. (2014). Based on calorimetric growth experiments using 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 C600, Jeong et al. (2009) showed that treatment with different doses of mānuka oil dissolved in Tween 80 (up to 4% 
 <italic>v/v</italic>) had a dose-dependent effect in reducing bacterial growth but was not as effective as treatment with 
 <italic>Melaleuca alternifolia</italic> oil [

 <italic>E. coli</italic> 0157 (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 27.8%). Similar doses were required to inhibit the growth of 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>. In comparison, treatment with 0.597% of concentrated mānuka oil was sufficient to retard the growth of 
 <italic>C. jejuni</italic> [
