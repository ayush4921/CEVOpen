<p>In order to corroborate the experimental data and understand the possible mechanism behind the antioxidant activity, molecular docking studies were examined using human peroxiredoxin 5 enzyme (PDB: 1HD2), which has a broader activity against ROS and was mostly involved in stress protection mechanisms and in cell differentiation. The listed binding energies of the formed complex between identified

 <xref rid="plants-09-01534-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) were found to be in the range −5.8 to −3.7 kcal/mol. From our molecular docking results, it can be suggested that all ligands interact favorably with the target proteins.
