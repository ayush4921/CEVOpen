<p>The β-carotene bleaching test was performed based on the experimental protocol done by Kadri et al. [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-09-01534" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Briefly, a mixture containing 20 μL of linoleic acid and 200 mg of Tween 20% (emulsifier) was added to a previously prepared solution by dissolving 0.2 mg of β-carotene in 1 mL of chloroform. After vacuum evaporation of the chloroform at 40 °C, a volume of 50 mL of oxygen sparged water was added to the obtained emulsion. Then, a volume of 5 mL of this emulsion was introduced into a tube containing 0.5 mL of the sample or BHT (reference synthetic antioxidant). Control solutions have been prepared in parallel. The antioxidant activity was determined according to the optical density of the sample at 470 nm against a control solution prepared as above, but devoid of β-carotene.
