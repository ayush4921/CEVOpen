<p>In the present study, carotenoids were determined in Saudi ecospecies, comprising five compounds 
 <italic>α</italic>-ionone and its two derivatives in addition to 
 <italic>α</italic>-damascenone and dihydroedulan II. On the other hand, three carotenoids were characterized in the Egyptian sample, including 
 <italic>trans</italic>-
 <italic>α</italic>-ionone (2.91%) and 
 <italic>α</italic>-iso methyl ionone (0.38%) as well as 
 <italic>α</italic>-damascenone (0.71%). Overall, the determined significant difference in chemical components between Saudi and Egyptian 
 <italic>C. procera</italic> might be ascribed to the variation of biosynthesis of the metabolites, including EOs. The biosynthesis of EOs components is directly affected by environmental and climatic factors such as temperature, altitude, seasonality, plant age, and water availability as well as the soil conditions [
