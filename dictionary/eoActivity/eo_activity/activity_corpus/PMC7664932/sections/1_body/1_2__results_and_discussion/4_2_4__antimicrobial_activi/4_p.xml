<p>On the other hand, the EO of the Egyptian ecospecies showed significant antibacterial activity against the tested bacterial strains, where it attained an inhibition zone ranging from 8.50 to 35 mm. At the highest concentration (2.50 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>), 
 <italic>Shigella</italic> spp. was the most inhibited strain and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> was the lowest inhibited one (

 <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>, while it attained an inhibition zone of 31.30 mm against 
 <italic>T. shoenlenii</italic>. Based on the MIC data, it is clear that the EO of Egyptian ecospecies has comparable activity against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic>, 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>, 
 <italic>S. typhi</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, and 
 <italic>Shigella</italic> spp., while 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> was more resistant (

 <italic>T. shoenlenii</italic> and 
 <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>, with MIC values of 15.75 and 15.79 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively (
