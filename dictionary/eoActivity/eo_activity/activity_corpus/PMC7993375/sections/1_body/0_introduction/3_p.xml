 </xref>. Structure activity relationships (SAR) studies with CA-4 have revealed three important structural features (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>). These include: (i) a 3,4,5-trimethoxy moiety on ring A that is essential for activity; (ii) a 
 <italic>cis</italic>-configuration of both aromatic rings that is essential for activity (
 <italic>trans</italic>-orientation is inactive); (iii) the presence of small substituent on ring B, e.g. methoxy group that is important for activity. The 
 <italic>cis</italic>-alkene configuration in CA-4 allows the aromatic rings to assume optimal binding orientation for interactions with the colchicine binding site. Unfortunately, the 
 <italic>cis</italic> configuration of CA-4 has a propensity for undergoing transformation to the inactive 
 <italic>trans</italic> configuration upon storage and during 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> metabolism. To overcome this, many structural modifications of CA-4 have been undertaken where the 
 <italic>cis</italic> double bond is replaced with heterocycles, either monocyclic, such as oxadiazole, isoxazole and imidazole, resulting in compounds, such as 
 <bold>1</bold>, 
 <bold>2</bold> and 
 <bold>3</bold> respectively (
