<p>In this work, we optimised CA-4 into a series of novel hybrid quinoline derivatives as potent tubulin inhibitor, which involves introducing a rigid oxazolone or imidazolone between rings A and B to maintain the cis configuration, as well as targeting the quinolyl moiety (ring B), by varying the electronic substituents effect while maintaining the 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl moiety as present in ring A of CA-4 (

 <bold>12a–h)</bold> and the imidazolones 
 <bold>(</bold>Compounds 
 <bold>13a–h</bold>). The compounds have been screened for their antiproliferative activities against a variety of cancer cell lines, as well as studied for their mechanism of action. We expect the results to lead to better understanding of the mechanistic mode of the compounds’ activity against tubulin and provide guidance for further development of potent anticancer drugs.
