<p>Cancer is a disease of an uncontrolled growth and abnormal division of cells, which leads to death. In recent years, targeted antineoplastic agents have become an effective treatment choice for cancer

 </xref>. Tubulin polymerisation inhibitors represent one of the most well-known and potential examples of such targeted cancer therapies

 </xref>. Tubulin is a globular protein that performs a substantial function in cell mitosis. Microtubules (MTs), which represent the basic constituents of eukaryotic cell, are cytoskeletons constructed by the association of α- and β-tubulin heterodimers with a head and tail pattern to form hollow cylindrical tubes (nearly 25 nm in diameter)

 </xref>. MTs play a crucial role in many fundamental cellular activities, such as motility, cell formation, cell secretion, signalling, maintenance of cell shape, regulation of intracellular transport and cell division

 </xref>. Disruption of MTs or tubulin dynamics exposes the cell to mitotic arrest of the cell cycle at G
 <sub>2</sub>/M phase, and consequently induction of cellular apoptosis

 </xref>. Several microtubule-interfering agents (MIAs) have been identified, e.g. paclitaxel, vincristine, and colchicine that are obtained from the natural products, taxol, vinca and colchicine, respectively. MIAs are known to bind to tubulin at specific binding sites that are classified as taxol, vinca and colchicine sites to either enhance or inhibit tubulin polymerisation.
