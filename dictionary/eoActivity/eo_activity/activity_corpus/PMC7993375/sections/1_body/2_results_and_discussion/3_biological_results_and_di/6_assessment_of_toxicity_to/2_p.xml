<p>To assess the cytotoxicity and selectivity of 
 <bold>12c</bold> towards cancer cells, normal epithelial breast MCF-10A cell viability study was carried out. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5(A)</xref>, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 
 <bold>12c</bold> was more than 50 µM in MCF-10A cells, which was significantly higher than the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 19, 10, 22 and 42 nM in MCF-7, HL-60, HCT-116 and HeLa cancer cell lines, respectively. Remarkably, 
 <bold>12c</bold> was found to be less toxic in normal MCF-10A (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt;50 µM) when compared to CA-4 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 6.1 µM) (

 <bold>12c</bold> to have better selective toxicity against cancer cells.
