<p>The natural product, Combretastatin A-4 (CA-4; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>) exhibits significant antiproliferative activities against several tumour cells by binding to the colchicine site of tubulin to inhibit the protein polymerisation

 </xref>. However, the 
 <italic>cis</italic> double bond of CA-4 has a propensity to isomerise into the inactive 
 <italic>trans</italic> configuration, leading to reduction in the molecule’s pharmacologic activity. Several structural modifications of the CA-4 pharmacophore have subsequently been undertaken to overcome this disadvantage, e.g. replacing the 
 <italic>cis</italic> double bond with a heterocycle, oxadiazole, isoxazole and imidazole, resulting in compounds, such as 
 <bold>1</bold>, 
 <bold>2</bold> and

 </xref>. In this work, we undertook a rational design approach of introducing chalcone system (ring C) in the form of either oxazolone or imidazolone between the two rings A and B, as well as isosterically replace ring B with quinolone. Specifically, the rigidity of the molecules was increased by introducing 1,3-oxazol-5-ones and 1,3-imidazol-4-ones to the 
 <italic>cis-</italic>olefinic bond of CA-4, which we anticipate would create a desirable conformational and configurational restriction to prevent isomerisation of CA-4 into the inactive 
 <italic>trans</italic>-isomer, as well as improve on the anticancer activities of these compounds since chalcones are well known for their anticancer properties
