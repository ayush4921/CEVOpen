<p>The previous data clearly demonstrate that 
 <bold>12c</bold> is an effective anti-mitotic quinoline compound in MCF-7 cell lines. Herein, the effect of 
 <bold>12c</bold> on the expression of apoptosis pathway markers, Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic protein and Bax pro-apoptotic protein was investigated. MCF-7 cells treated with 
 <bold>12c</bold> at 250 nM for 48 h decreased the expression level of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, and correspondingly up-regulated the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax (
