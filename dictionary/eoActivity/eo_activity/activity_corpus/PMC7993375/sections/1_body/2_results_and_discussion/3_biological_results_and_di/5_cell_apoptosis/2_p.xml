<p>We investigated whether cell death induced by compound 
 <bold>12c</bold> treatment was related to apoptosis using the Annexin-V/PI double staining flow cytometric assay (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4(A,B)</xref>). MCF-7 cells were treated with three different concentrations (0, 50 and 250 nM) of compound 
 <bold>12c</bold> at different time points (24, 48 and 72 h). Compound 
 <bold>12c</bold> caused a significant accumulation of annexine-V positive cells and induced both early and late apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner compared to the untreated cells. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4(B)</xref>, when the cells were treated with 
 <bold>12c (</bold>0 and 250 nM) or CA-4 (50 nM) for 48 h, the percentage of Annexin V-staining positive cells significantly increased from 1% in untreated cells to 15%, 21% and 29% respectively. The percentage of early and late apoptotic cells in the presence of 
 <bold>12c</bold> increased after 72 h to 17.6% and 29.3% at 1 and 5 µM respectively when compared to the untreated cells (2%). Based on the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis findings (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3(B–D)</xref>), it appears that compound 
 <bold>12c</bold> could efficiently induce apoptosis cell death in MCF-7 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner.
