<p>The position of the methoxy substituent on the quinoline heterocycle also influenced the antiproliferative activity of the compounds against the cancer cell lines. For example, the antiproliferative activity of 6-methoxy-substituted 
 <bold>13e</bold> was better than its analog 7-methoxy-substituted 
 <bold>13f</bold> against MCF-7, HCT-116 and HeLa cells with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.042, 0.085 and 0.062 µM, which compare to 0.092, 0.187 and 0.101 µM for 
 <bold>13f</bold>, respectively. However, in HL-60, 
 <bold>13e</bold> exhibited less antiproliferative activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.272 µM. In a similar trend as the oxazolone derivatives, bulky substituents on the quinoline ring 
 <bold>13g</bold> (7-
 <italic>tert</italic>-butyl) and 
 <bold>13h</bold> (7-benzyloxy) resulted in drastic decrease in activity in all four cancer cell lines with 14- to 125-fold loss in potency compared to their corresponding 
 <bold>13f</bold> (7-methoxy containing) compound.
