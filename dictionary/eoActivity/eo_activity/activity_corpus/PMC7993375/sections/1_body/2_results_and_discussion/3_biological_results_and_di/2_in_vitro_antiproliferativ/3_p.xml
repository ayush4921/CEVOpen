<p>The imidazolones (Compound 
 <bold>13a</bold>–
 <bold>h)</bold> also resulted in impressive antiproliferative activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 0.04–8.21 µM in all four cell lines. In general, the imidazolones showed similar antiproliferative activities as the oxazolones (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), which could be due to similar electronic effects of the oxazolone and imidazolone rings. Like the oxazolone, lack of substituent on the quinolone ring as in compound 
 <bold>13a</bold> led to reduction in activity, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of more than 1 µM in all four cell lines, similar to the results obtained with the oxazolone derivative 
 <bold>12a</bold>. Methyl substitution on the quinoline ring, e.g. 6-CH
 <sub>3</sub>
 <bold>13b</bold>, 7-CH
 <sub>3</sub>
 <bold>13c</bold> and 8-CH
 <sub>3</sub>
 <bold>13d</bold> led to potent activity in submicromolar range in all four cancer cell lines.
