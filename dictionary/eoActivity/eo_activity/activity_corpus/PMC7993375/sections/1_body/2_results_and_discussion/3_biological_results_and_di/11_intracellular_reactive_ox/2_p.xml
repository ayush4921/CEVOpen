 </xref>. The production of ROS after 
 <bold>12c</bold> treatment at 50 and 250 nM, as well as CA-4 (50 nM) with hydrogen peroxide H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> was followed with 2,7–dichlorofluorescin diacetate (H
 <sub>2</sub>-DCFDA). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0010">Figure 10</xref>, after 24 h of 
 <bold>12c</bold> treatment, the levels of ROS in MCF-7 cells were 22.7 and 26.6% at 50 and 250 nM, respectively. The level in untreated MCF-7 cells was 1.0%, while it increased only to 18.3% in CA-4-treated cells. This result along with the significant loss of mitochondrial membrane potential above clearly suggests that compound 
 <bold>12c</bold> induced apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway.
