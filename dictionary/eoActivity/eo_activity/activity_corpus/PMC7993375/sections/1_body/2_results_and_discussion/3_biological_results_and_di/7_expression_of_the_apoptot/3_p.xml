 </xref>. The amount of activated caspase-9 was examined in MCF-7 cells treated with 
 <bold>12c</bold>. As observed from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6(C)</xref>, compound 
 <bold>12c</bold> at 50 and 250 nM produced about 8- and 16-fold increases in caspase-9 activation respectively when compared to 14-fold for CA-4 (50 nM). This finding confirms that compound 
 <bold>12c</bold> like CA-4 enhanced the rate of apoptosis in MCF-7 cell through caspase-9 activation.
