<p>The syntheses of the proposed quinoline compounds 
 <bold>12a–h</bold> (oxazolones) and 
 <bold>13a–h (</bold>imidazolones) (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="SCH001 SCH002">Schemes 1 and 2</xref> and involve two core structural components: (i) 2-methoxyquinolyl-3-carbaldehyde nucleus 
 <bold>8a–h</bold>, and (ii) 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl moiety 
 <bold>11</bold>. A concise (three-step) synthesis was used for the synthesis of the first core structure, 2-methoxyquinoline-3-carbaldehyde derivatives 
 <bold>8a–h,</bold> as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="SCH001">Scheme 1</xref>. The synthesis was initiated with acetylation of the starting aniline derivatives 
 <bold>5a–h</bold> using acetic anhydride and glacial acetic acid at 0 °C. The produced amides 
 <bold>6a–h</bold> were subjected to Vilsmeier–Haack reaction to give the corresponding quinoline-3-aldehyde derivatives 
 <bold>7a–h</bold>. Addition of methoxy substituent to 
 <bold>7a–h</bold> to give 
 <bold>8a–h</bold> was achieved through the use of sodium methoxide at 40 °C in methanol

 </xref>. The synthesis of the second core 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl moiety 
 <bold>11</bold> started with acylation of the acid 
 <bold>9</bold> under highly acidic condition using SOCl

 </xref>. Following, treatment of the acyl benzotriazole 
 <bold>10</bold> with glycine in aqueous acetonitrile gave the acyl glycine 
 <bold>11</bold>. Condensation of 
 <bold>11</bold> with the appropriate quinoline aldehydes 
 <bold>8a–h</bold> in the presence of acetic anhydride and catalytic amount of sodium acetate resulted in the formation of the oxazolones 
 <bold>12a–h</bold>. Aminolysis of 
 <bold>12a–h</bold> via condensation reaction with ammonia led to the formation of the imidazolones 
 <bold>13a–h</bold>. It seems the nucleophilic ammonia attacks the carbonyl group of the oxazolone ring, followed by immediate intramolecular condensation and cyclisation to give the imidazolones 
 <bold>13a–h</bold>. In summary, two classes of compounds, 
 <bold>12a–h</bold> (oxazolones) and 
 <bold>13a–h</bold> (imidazolones) were synthesised and used for further functional and biological studies.
