<p>All the synthesised compounds (with CA-4 as a positive reference) were evaluated for their antiproliferative activities using MTT assay with four different cancer cell lines – MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma, HL-60 leukaemia, HCT-116 colorectal carcinoma, and HeLa cervical adenocarcinoma. As shown in 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, most of the compounds demonstrated moderate to highly potent antiproliferative activities. In the oxazolone analogues (
 <bold>12a</bold>–
 <bold>h</bold>), compound 
 <bold>12a</bold> without any substituent on the quinoline ring was the least active when compared with quinoline ring substituted compounds. The relative position of the substituent on the quinoline ring also seemed to be critical for antiproliferative activity. Compound 
 <bold>12c</bold> with methyl group at the 7-position ring displayed impressive non-selective potency in nanomolar range against HL-60, MCF-7, HCT-116 and HeLa cell lines with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.019, 0.010, 0.022 and 0.042 µM, which compared to 0.076, 0.019. 0.026 and 0.064 µM for CA-4, respectively. In contrast, both the 6-CH
 <sub>3</sub> analog (
 <bold>12b</bold>) and 8-CH
 <sub>3</sub> analog (
 <bold>12d</bold>) were 3- to 15-fold less active than 
 <bold>12c</bold>. The nature of the substituents on the quinoline ring of the oxazolone compounds was also found to significantly influence the biological activity. For example, replacement of the methyl group in 
 <bold>12b</bold> and 
 <bold>12c</bold> with a stronger electron-releasing methoxy group yielded compounds 
 <bold>12e</bold> and 
 <bold>12f</bold>, respectively, which resulted in better antiproliferative activities. The methoxy-containing compound 
 <bold>12e</bold> was 2.7- to 13-fold more active than the methyl-containing compound 
 <bold>12b</bold> with the four cancer cell lines (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.068, 0.056, 0.031 and 0.010 µM in HL-60, MCF-7, HCT-116 and HeLa cancer cell lines, respectively). Compound 
 <bold>12f</bold> had a similar effect as 
 <bold>12c</bold> against MCF-7 and HCT-116 cells (0.052 and 0.066 µM, respectively), but with reduction in activity against the other two cell lines, HL-60 and HeLa (0.352 and 0.138 µM, respectively). Introducing larger substituents at the quinoline ring as in 
 <bold>12g</bold> (7-
 <italic>tert</italic>-butyl) and 
 <bold>12h</bold> (7-benzyloxy) led to a dramatic decrease in activity compared to their corresponding analog 
 <bold>12f</bold> (7-methoxy). Summarily, adding smaller and/or polar groups to the quinoline ring of the oxazolone resulted in significant improvement in the antiproliferative activity.
