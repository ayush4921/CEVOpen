 </xref>. To confirm whether the quinoline compounds similarly target the tubulin-microtubule system, representative quinoline compounds, including four oxazolone analogues (
 <bold>12a</bold>, 
 <bold>12c</bold>, 
 <bold>12e</bold> and 
 <bold>12g</bold>) and two imidazolone analogues (
 <bold>13c</bold> and 
 <bold>13e</bold>), as well as the reference compound CA-4, were evaluated for their antitubulin polymerisation activities and the results presented in 
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The methyl and methoxy substituted oxazolone compounds 
 <bold>12c</bold> and 
 <bold>12e,</bold> respectively strongly inhibited tubulin assembly with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1.21 and 2.26 µM, respectively compared to that of CA-4 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 2.17 µM), while the unsubstituted analogue 
 <bold>12a</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 13.98 µM) and 
 <italic>tert-</italic>butyl analog 
 <bold>12g</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 8.23 µM) were 6- and 4-fold less active than CA-4. The imidazolone compound 
 <bold>13e</bold> with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1.48 µM also showed very potent tubulin polymerisation inhibition compared to CA-4. The methyl analogue 
 <bold>13c</bold> was inactive in the tubulin polymerisation assay (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 20.29 µM), and is 16-fold less active compared to its corresponding oxazolone derivative 
 <bold>12c</bold>, which is in agreements with the poor cell growth inhibitory activity of 
 <bold>13c</bold> compared to 
 <bold>12c</bold>.
