<p>Induction of cell cycle arrest at G
 <sub>2</sub>/M phase is strongly accompanied with tubulin polymerisation inhibition. It is well established that CA-4 arrests cell cycle at G
 <sub>2</sub>M phase

 </xref>. To further gain insight into compound 
 <bold>12c</bold> potent antiproliferative activity, cell cycle analysis of MCF-7 cells was performed at two concentrations of 50 nM and 250 nM and at different time points of 0, 24, 48 and 72 h. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3(A)</xref> clearly demonstrates that 
 <bold>12c</bold> caused a significant arrest in G
 <sub>2</sub>/M phase and apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. After 48 h, the percentage of G
 <sub>2</sub>/M phase arrested cells were 28.4% and 38.3% at 50 nM and 250 nM, respectively compared to 9.2% of untreated cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3(B)</xref>). Moreover, there was an increase in the number of cells in G
 <sub>2</sub>/M phase after 72 h (33.0% and 40.8% at 50 nM and 250 nM, respectively) with a concomitant decrease of cells in G
 <sub>0</sub>/G
 <sub>1</sub> phase (40.3% and 29.8% at 50 nM and 250 nM, respectively) compared to the control (57.3%). In a comparable finding, CA-4 (50 nM) also significantly arrested G
 <sub>2</sub>/M phase at 24, 48 and 72 h (40.3%, 43.8% and 47.7%, respectively). Accordingly, a concomitant decrease of MCF-7 cells was detected in G0 phase (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3(C)</xref>). Furthermore, compound 
 <bold>12c</bold> induced a gradual increase in apoptosis (16.2%, 23.4% and 32.7%) at 250 nM as the proportion of cells in the sub-G1 phase increased at 24, 48 and 72 h, respectively compared to untreated cells (1.5%) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3(D)</xref>). Similarly, 23.5%, 31.1% and 37.4% increase in apoptosis was observed for CA-4 at 24, 48 and 72 h, respectively. These findings are in agreement with previously reported for a series of related quinoline analogues, which significantly induced apoptosis and G
 <sub>2</sub>/M cycle arrest in MCF-7 cells
