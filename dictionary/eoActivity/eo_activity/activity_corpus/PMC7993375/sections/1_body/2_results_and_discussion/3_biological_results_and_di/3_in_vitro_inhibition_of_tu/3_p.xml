<p>Compound 
 <bold>12c</bold> was also examined at two different concentrations (1 and 5 µM) for its ability to compete with colchicine for binding to tubulin using a [
 <sup>3</sup>H] colchicine binding assay. Compound 
 <bold>12c</bold> strongly inhibited colchicine binding to tubulin by 79% and 87% at 1 and 5 µM respectively, which compares with 86% and 97% inhibition by CA-4, respectively. These results suggest that compound 
 <bold>12c</bold> is involved in tubulin polymerisation inhibition through the colchicine-binding site.
