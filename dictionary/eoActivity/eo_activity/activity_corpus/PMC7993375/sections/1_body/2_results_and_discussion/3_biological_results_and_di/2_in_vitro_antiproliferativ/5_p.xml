<p>In summary, both oxazolone and imidazolone compounds displayed potent antiproliferative effects, strengthening our hypothesis that nitrogen-containing heterocycles, such as quinoline, are beneficial surrogates for the ring B of CA-4. The different biological activities of the compounds are likely the result of differences in their mode of interaction with the colchicine binding site. Due to its excellent antiproliferative activity, compound 
 <bold>12c</bold> was studied in more details as described below.
