 </xref>. In order to investigate the effect of compound 
 <bold>12c</bold> on the migration of MCF-7, wound healing assay was performed. As illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0008">Figure 8(A,B)</xref>, the untreated cells migrated to the scraped area while in 
 <bold>12c</bold>-treated wells, cell migration was significantly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. This significant difference in the wound area confirms that 
 <bold>12c</bold> suppressed MCF-7 cell migration, an important event in tumour metastasis.
