<p>Mitochondria membrane potential plays a crucial role in the propagation of apoptosis. Specifically, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential Δψ
 <sub>mt</sub> (MMP) is characteristic of early stage of apoptosis

 </xref>. To confirm whether compound 
 <bold>12c</bold> could decrease the MMP of MCF-7 cancer cells, MMP was monitored by the fluorescence of the dye DiOC2(3). MCF-7 cells treated with 
 <bold>12c</bold> at 50 and 250 nM exhibited significant decrease in MMP in a dose- and time-dependant manner (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0009">Figure 9(A)</xref>). This depletion in MMP was associated with an increase of annexin-V positive early apoptotic cells. Maximum decrease in MCF-7 MMP was detected after 24 h treatment with 
 <bold>12c</bold> in which the percentage of apoptotic cells increased from 1.1% to 24.9% and 31.3% at 50 and 250 nM, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0009">Figure 9(B)</xref>). This indicates that compound 
 <bold>12c</bold> induces mitochondrial dysfunction in MCF-7, which eventually triggered apoptotic cell death. These results are in agreement with previously reported CA-4 analogues study that were shown to cause apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway
