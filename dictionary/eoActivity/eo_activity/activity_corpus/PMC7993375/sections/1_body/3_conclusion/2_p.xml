<p>In this study, we designed, synthesised and evaluated two classes of novel quinoline compounds combretastatin A-4 derivatives as potential inhibitors of tubulin polymerisation. Several other studies have also reported derivatisation of the CA-4 pharmacophore with varying success

 </xref>. Unlike the previous compounds, we for the first time introduced a chalcone system, including oxazolones and imidazolones to the 
 <italic>cis</italic> bond of CA-4 to give more rigidity to the required active conformation. The chalcone system is well known for its anticancer activities. Our design also kept the essential natural trimethoxyphenyl pharmacophore (found in CA-4), while varying the electronic substituents effect on the quinolyl moiety (ring B) that were expected to enhance the potency of the compounds. Most of the compounds showed significant and, in some instances, comparable antiproliferative activities against different cancer cell lines as the previously studied combretastatin A-4 compound, CA-4. One of the most promising compound 
 <bold>12c</bold> showed potent anti-proliferative activities against HL-60, MCF-7, HCT-116 and HeLA cancer cell lines with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.019, 0.010, 0.022 and 0.042 µM, respectively, and simultaneously low cytotoxicity towards MCF-10A non-cancer cells. The microtubule polymerisation inhibitory effect of 
 <bold>12c</bold> was confirmed with an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> tubulin polymerisation and colchicine inhibition assays. Compound 
 <bold>12c</bold> effectively block the G
 <sub>2</sub>/M phase at the cell cycle and induce MCF-7 cell apoptosis together with significant change of Bax/Bcl expression ratio indicating involvement of mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Further cellular mechanistic studies confirmed that 
 <bold>12c</bold> inhibited MCF-7 cell migration and colony formation. In conclusion, these results highlight our novel quinoline compounds and particularly 
 <bold>12c</bold> as promising anti-tubulin agent for the treatment of MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Moreover, the results point to a direction for rational development of potent tubulin polymerisation inhibitors for the treatment of cancer.
