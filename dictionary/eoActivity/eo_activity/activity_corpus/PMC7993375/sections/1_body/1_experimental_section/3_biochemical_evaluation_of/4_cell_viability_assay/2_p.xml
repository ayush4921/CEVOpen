<p>The quinoline compounds were evaluated for antiproliferative effect using the MTT viability assay of four cancer cell lines (MCF-7, HCT-116, HL-60 and HeLa) and normal breast cells MCF-10A to calculate the relative IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for each compound. Cells were seeded in triplicate in 96-well plates at a density of 10 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> cells/ml in a total volume of 200 µl per well. 0.1% of DMSO was used as a vehicle control. Following, the cells were treated with 2 µl test compound (from stock solutions in ethanol) to furnish the concentration range of study, 1 nM to 50 µM, and re-incubated for a further 72 h. The culture medium was then removed, and the cells washed with 100 µL phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and 50 µL MTT added, to reach a final concentration of 1 mg/mL. Cells were incubated for 2 h in darkness at 37 °C. Solubilisation was begun through the addition of 200 ml DMSO, and the cells maintained at room temperature in darkness for 20 min to ensure thorough colour diffusion before reading the absorbance. Plates were incubated for 72 h at 37 °C + 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The MTT (5 mg/mL in PBS) was added and incubated for another 4 h, and the optical density was detected with a microplate reader at 570 nm. Results were expressed as percentage viability relative to vehicle control (100%). Dose response curves were plotted and IC
 <sub>50</sub> values (concentration of drug resulting in 50% reduction in cell survival) were obtained using the commercial software package Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). All the experiments were repeated in at least three independent experiments.
