<p>The affinity of compounds 
 <bold>12c</bold> to colchicine binding site was determined using Colchicine Site Competitive Assay kit CytoDYNAMIX Screen15 (Cytoskeleton, Inc., Denver, CO, USA) using the standard protocol of the manufacturer to determine Ki. Biotin-labelled tubulin (0.5 µg) in 10 µL of reaction buffer was mixed with [3H]colchicine (0.08 µM, PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) and the test compounds (positive control colchicine, negative control vinblastine, G-1, fluorescent G-1, or 2-ME) in a 96-well plate (final volume: 100 µL). After incubating for 2 h at 37 °C with gentle shaking, streptavidin-labelled yttrium SPA beads (80 µg in 20 µL reaction buffer, PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) were added to each well and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The plates were then read on a scintillation counter (Packard Instrument, Topcount Microplate Reader) and the percentage of inhibition was calculated
