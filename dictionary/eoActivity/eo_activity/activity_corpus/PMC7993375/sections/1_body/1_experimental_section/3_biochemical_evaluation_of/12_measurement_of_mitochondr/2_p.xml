<p>Mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ
 <sub>mt</sub>) was measured by flow cytometry with DiOC2(3) staining and additional labelling with an annexin V conjugate. After treatment with compound 
 <bold>12c</bold> (50 and 250 nM) and CA-4 (50 nM), cells were stained with DiOC2(3) dye for 30 min in the incubator, then harvested and washed with PBS. DiOC2(3)-stained cells were resuspended with 1X annexin binding buffer, followed by addition of annexin V conjugate and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The data from the flow cytometry were analysed by Cell Quest software. Production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was measured using 2,7–dichlorofluorescin diacetate (H
 <sub>2</sub>-DCFDA) dye. MCF-7 cells were seeded and treated either with vehicle (0.1% DMSO) or with compound 
 <bold>12c</bold> (50 and 250 nM) or CA-4 (50 nM) for 6, 12 and 24 h. H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> was used as a positive control. The amount of ROS generated was estimated after 2 h of selected compound treatment. The cells were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with PBS. Cells were then incubated with DCFDA dye (25 µM) in dark at 37 °C for 1 h. Fluorescence spectra (510 − 600 nm) were monitored using an excitation wavelength of 488 nm
