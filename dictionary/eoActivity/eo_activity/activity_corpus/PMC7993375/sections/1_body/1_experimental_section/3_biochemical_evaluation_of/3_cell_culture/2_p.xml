<p>The four human tumour cell lines MCF-7, HCT-116, HL-60 and HeLa used in this study were obtained from the VACSERA (Giza, Egypt) cell culture unit that were originally acquired from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). All the human tumour cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) with 10% foetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine and 100 µg/mL penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were maintained at 37˚C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> in a humidified incubator. All cells were sub-cultured 3 times/week by trypsinisation using TrypLE Express (1X).
