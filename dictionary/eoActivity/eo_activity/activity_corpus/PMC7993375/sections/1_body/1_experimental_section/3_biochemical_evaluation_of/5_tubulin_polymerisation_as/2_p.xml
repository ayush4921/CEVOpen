<p>The assembly of purified bovine tubulin was monitored using a kit, BK006, purchased from Cytoskeleton Inc., (Denver, CO, USA). The assay was carried out in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions using the standard assay conditions

 </xref>. Briefly, purified (&gt;99%) bovine brain tubulin (3 mg/mL) in a buffer consisting of 80 mM PIPES (pH 6.9), 0.5 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 1 mM GTP and 10% glycerol was incubated at 37 °C in the presence of either vehicle (2% (v/v) ddH
 <sub>2</sub>O), CA-4, or the quinoline compounds. Light is scattered proportionally to the concentration of polymerised microtubules in the assay. Therefore, tubulin assembly was monitored turbidimetrically at 340 nm in a Spectramax 340 PC spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The concentration that inhibits tubulin polymerisation by 50% (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) was determined using area under the curve (AUC). The AUC of the untreated controls were considered as 100% polymerisation. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> value for each compound was computed using GraphPad Prism Software.
