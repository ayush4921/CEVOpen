<p>The level of the anti-apoptotic marker and apoptotic marker BAX were assessed using Bcl-2 Elisa kit and human Bax ELISA Kit purchased from Zymed laboratories, invitrogen and Cloud-Clone Crop. (Katy, TX, USA), respectively, following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, Treated MCF-7 cell lysate with 250 nM of compound 
 <bold>12c</bold> were prepared, and equal amount of cell lysates were loaded and propped with specific antibodies. The samples were measured and analysed at 450 nm in ROBONEK P2000 ELISA reader

 <italic>In Vitro</italic> Caspase-9 Activation Assay was performed using human active caspase-9 Invitrogen EIA kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Compound 
 <bold>12c</bold> at concentrations of 50 and 250 nM and CA-4 (50 nM) were prepared in dH
 <sub>2</sub>O up to a final volume of 50 µL/well followed by addition of 5 µL of active caspase-9. Following, the cells were mixed and 50 µL of the Master Mix was added to each well and allowed to react at 37 °C for 1 h. The fluorescence intensity of the test samples was recorded and analysed in a fluorescence plate reader at 400 nm excitation and 505 nm emissions. All experiments were conducted in triplicates.
