<p>Melting points were determined with a Gallenkamp (London, UK) melting point apparatus and are uncorrected. IR spectra (KBr, cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) were recorded on Bruker Vector, 22FT-IR [Fourier Transform Infra-red (FTIR), Germany] spectrometer. Unless otherwise specified, proton (
 <sup>1</sup>H) and carbon (
 <sup>13</sup>C) NMR spectra were recorded at room temperature in base filtered CDCl
 <sub>3</sub> on a spectrometer operating at 400 &amp; 300 MHz for proton and 100 &amp; 75 MHz for carbon nuclei. The signal due to residual CHCl
 <sub>3</sub> appearing at δ H 7.26 and (CH
 <sub>3</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>SO appearing at δ H 2.5 and the central resonance of the CDCl
 <sub>3</sub> “triplet” appearing at δ C 77.0 and for (CD
 <sub>3</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>SO “multiplet” appearing at δ C 39.0 were used to reference 1H and 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra, respectively. 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR data are recorded as follows: chemical shift (δ) [multiplicity, coupling constant(s) J (Hz), relative integral] where multiplicity is defined as s = singlet; d = doublet; t = triplet; q = quartette; and m = multiplet or combinations of the above. Elemental analyses were determined using Manual Elemental Analyser Heraeus (Germany) and Automatic Elemental Analyser CHN Model 2400 Perkin Elmer (Waltham, MA, USA) at Microanalytical Centre, Faculty of Science, Cairo University, Egypt. All the elemental analyses results corresponded to calculated values within experimental error. Progress of reactions was monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) using precoated TLC sheets with Ultraviolet (UV) fluorescent silica gel (Merck 60F254), and spots were visualised by iodine vapours or irradiation with UV light (254 nm). All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or Lancaster Synthesis Corporation (UK). Intermediates
