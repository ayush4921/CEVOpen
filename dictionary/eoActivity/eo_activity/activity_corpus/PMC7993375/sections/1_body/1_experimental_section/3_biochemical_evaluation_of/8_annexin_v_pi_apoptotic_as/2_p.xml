<p>Apoptotic cell death was detected by flow cytometry using Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI). MCF-7 Cells were seeded in 6 well plated at density of 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/mL and treated with vehicle (0.1% (v/v) EtOH), positive control (CA-4) or compound 
 <bold>12c</bold> (50 and 250 nM) for 24, 48 and 72 h. Cells were then harvested and prepared for flow cytometric analysis. Cells were washed in 1X binding buffer (20X binding buffer: 0.1 M HEPES, pH 7.4; 1.4 M NaCl; 25 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> diluted in dH
 <sub>2</sub>O) and incubated in the dark for 30 min on ice in Annexin V-containing binding buffer [1:100]. Cells were then washed once in binding buffer and then re-suspended in PI-containing binding buffer [1:1000]. Samples were analysed immediately using the BD accuri flow cytometer and prism software for analysis the data. Four populations are produced during the assay Annexin V and PI negative (Q4, healthy cells), Annexin V positive and PI negative (Q3, early apoptosis), Annexin V and PI positive (Q2, late apoptosis) and Annexin V negative and PI positive (Q1, necrosis).
