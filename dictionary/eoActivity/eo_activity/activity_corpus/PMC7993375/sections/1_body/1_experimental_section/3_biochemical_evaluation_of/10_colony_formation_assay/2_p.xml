<p>MCF-7 cells (600 cells per well) were seeded in 6-well plates and incubated for 24 h before being then treated with different doses of the compound 
 <bold>12c</bold> (50 and 250 nM) for 14 days. Following, the cells were washed with PBS twice and subsequently fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.05% crystal violet for 30 min. Finally, cells were visualised using an inverted microscope.
