<p>MCF-7 cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well in 6-well plates and treated with CA-4 (50 nM) and compound 
 <bold>12c</bold> (50 and 250 nM) for 24, 48 and 72 h. The cells were collected by trypsinisation and centrifuged at 800×
 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol overnight at −20 °C. Fixed cells were centrifuged at 800×
 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min and stained with 50 µg/mL of PI, containing 50 µg/mL of DNase-free RNase A, at 37 °C for 30 min. The DNA content of cells (10,000 cells/experimental group) was analysed by flow cytometer at 488 nm using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and all data were recorded and analysed using the CellQuest Software (Becton-Dickinson).
