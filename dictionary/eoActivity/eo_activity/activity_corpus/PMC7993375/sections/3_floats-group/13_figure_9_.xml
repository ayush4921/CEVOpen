  <p>Assessment of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ
   <sub>mt</sub>) after treatment of MCF-7 cells with 
   <bold>12c</bold>. Cells were treated with indicated concentration of compound 
   <bold>12c</bold> for 6, 12 and 24 h and then stained with fluorescent DiOC2(3) for analysis of mitochondrial potential. Cells were then analysed by flow cytometry as described in the experimental section. Data are presented as mean ± SEM of three independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using two-way ANOVA (**
