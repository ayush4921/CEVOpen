  <p>(A) Effect of compound 
   <bold>12c</bold> on the cell cycle and apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. Cells were treated with either vehicle [0.1% ethanol (v/v)], CA-4 (50 nM), 
   <bold>12c</bold> (50 nM and 250 nM) for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h. Cells were then fixed, stained with PI, and analysed by flow cytometry. Cell cycle analysis was performed on histograms of gated counts per DNA area (FL2-A). The number of cells with (B) 4 N (G
   <sub>2</sub>/M), (C) 2 N(G
   <sub>0</sub>G
   <sub>1</sub>), and (D) &lt;2 N (sub-G
   <sub>1</sub>) DNA content was determined with CellQuest software. Values represent the mean ± SEM for three independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using two-way ANOVA (*
