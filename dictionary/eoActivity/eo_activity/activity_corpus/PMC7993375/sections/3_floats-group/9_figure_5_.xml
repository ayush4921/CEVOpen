  <p>Dose response curve for (A) Compound 
   <bold>12c</bold> and (B) CA-4 on the proliferation of breast cancer MCF-7 and normal breast MCF-10A cells. Cells were grown in 96-well plates and treated with serial concentrations of compound 
   <bold>12c or</bold> CA-4 for 72â€‰h. Cell viability was expressed as percentage of vehicle control [ethanol 1% (v/v)] treated cells and was measured by MTT assay (average of three independent experiments).
