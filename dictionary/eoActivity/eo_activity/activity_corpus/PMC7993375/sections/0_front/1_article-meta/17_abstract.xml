 <title>Abstract</title>
 <p>A new series of quinoline derivatives of combretastatin A-4 have been designed, synthesised and demonstrated as tubulin polymerisation inhibitors. These novel compounds showed significant antiproliferative activities, among them, 
  <bold>12c</bold> exhibited the most potent inhibitory activity against different cancer cell lines (MCF-7, HL-60, HCT-116 and HeLa) with IC
  <sub>50</sub> ranging from 0.010 to 0.042 µM, and with selectivity profile against MCF-10A non-cancer cells. Further mechanistic studies suggest that 
  <bold>12c</bold> can inhibit tubulin polymerisation and cell migration, leading to G
  <sub>2</sub>/M phase arrest. Besides, 
  <bold>12c</bold> induces apoptosis 
  <italic>via</italic> a mitochondrial-dependant apoptosis pathway and caused reactive oxygen stress generation in MCF-7 cells. These results provide guidance for further rational development of potent tubulin polymerisation inhibitors for the treatment of cancer.
