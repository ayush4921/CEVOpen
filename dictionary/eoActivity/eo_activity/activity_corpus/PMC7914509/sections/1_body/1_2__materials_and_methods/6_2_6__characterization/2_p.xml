<p>DM-ZnO NP and DM-ZnO Try NE synthesized nanoformulations were dispersed in DM water at 1 mg/mL concentration. Then, it was observed by UV–Vis spectrophotometer (Ultrospec TM-2100 pro, Biochrom Ltd, Cambridge, UK) between 200 and 700 nm for the confirmation of the composition and any foreign matters or side products during the preparation. The outer core surface was formed by the plant extract for both the NPs and NE and was confirmed by FTIR analysis (PerkinElmer Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) between 4000 and 600 cm
 <sup>1</sup>. The spectral graph was designated as transmittance (%) against wavenumber (cm
 <sup>−1</sup>). The size, surface charge, and stability of the prepared samples were characterized using DLS at 25 °C at 1 mg/mL concentration utilizing the zeta analyzer and ELSZ-2000 series (Otsuka Electronics Photal, Osaka, Japan) at pH 7.4. Further confirmation on the morphology of the prepared DM-ZnO NP and DM-ZnO Try NE was inspected using a multifunctional 200 kV-operated JEM-2100 F (JEOL, Akishima, Japan). For this analysis, a copper grid was employed to determine the samples. Topographical and elemental confirmations were investigated using FE-SEM with the following conditions and instruments. (LEO SUPRA 55, GENESIS 2000 (Carl Zeiss, EDAX, Oberkochen, Germany); gun: thermal field emission type; resolution: 1.0 nm @15 kV, 1.7 nm @1 kV, and 4.0 nm @0.1 kV; magnification: 12–900,000×).
