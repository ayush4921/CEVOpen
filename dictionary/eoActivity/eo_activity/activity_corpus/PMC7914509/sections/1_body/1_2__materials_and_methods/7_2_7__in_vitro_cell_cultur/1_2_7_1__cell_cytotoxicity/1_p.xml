<p>The cytotoxicity of DM-ZnO-Try against 3T3-L1 cells and RAW 264.7 was assessed using the MTT assay. In short, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were cultured at a density of 2 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> cells/well and incubated overnight until the cells attain full confluence. After incubating for overnight, the cells were then treated with four samples, namely DM extract, DM-ZnO NPs, DM-ZnO-Try NE, and Try at different concentrations (3.125 μg/mL, 6.25 μg/mL, 12.5 μg/mL, and 25 μg/mL) for 3 h and 24 h. At the indicated time intervals, 20 μL of MTT solution was added, and incubated at dark for 2–4 h. Similarly, RAW 264.7 cells were plated at a density of 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/well in a 96-well plate and incubated overnight until the cells grow to full confluence. After incubating overnight, cells were then treated with four samples, namely DM extract, DM-ZnO NPs, DM-ZnO-Try NE, and Try at different concentrations (3.125 μg/mL, 6.25 μg/mL, 12.5 μg/mL, and 25 μg/mL) for the time period of 3 h and 24 h. At the designated time intervals, 20 μL of MTT solution was added and incubated at dark for 2–4 h. The formazan crystals in each well of both cell lines were dissolved in 100 μL of DMSO, and the absorbance was measured with an ELISA plated reader at 570 nm.
