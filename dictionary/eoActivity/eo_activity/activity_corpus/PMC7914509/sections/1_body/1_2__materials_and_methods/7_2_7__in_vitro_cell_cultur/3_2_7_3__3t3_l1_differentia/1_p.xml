<p>3T3-L1 fibroblast preadipocytes were cultured in DMEM, which contains 10% FBS and 1% P/S, determined as complete media, in a CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator at 37 °C. For stimulation of adipocyte differentiation, cells were seeded at a density of 0.8 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> per well into 6-well plates. Two days after cells got confluence (defined as day 0), they were exposed to the differentiation medium containing 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 1 μM dexamethasone, and 10 μg/mL insulin. After the first three days (day 3), the differentiation medium consisting of insulin was treated for two days, and then the medium was changed every two days with the same media until the cells are fully differentiated, with or without DM-ZnO-Try NE (10 mg/mL concentration). On day 13, the 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were differentiated into mature adipocytes. The effect of these treatments on lipid accumulation by adipocytes was examined by the Oil Red O (ORO) staining method as follows. In brief, dissolved 0.7 g Oil Red O powder in 200 mL of 100% isopropanol and stirred overnight. The solution was filtered through a 0.22 μm membrane filter and stored at 4 °C. Fresh Oil Red O working solutions were prepared by mixing the stock solution with distilled water (6:4) and then incubated for 20 min following filtration. The cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed with 10% formaldehyde in PBS at 25 °C for 1 h. Once the cells were fixed, they were washed with distilled water thrice and then stained the differentiated cells with Oil Red O working solution at 25 °C for 2 h. Finally, the cells were rinsed again three times using distilled water and photographed with an Nikon instruments, Melville, NJ, USA. After taking pictures, to check the intracellular lipid content, the Oil Red O dye was eluted with isopropanol and was measured with an Epoch
 <sup>®</sup> micro volume spectrophotometer at 520 nm.
