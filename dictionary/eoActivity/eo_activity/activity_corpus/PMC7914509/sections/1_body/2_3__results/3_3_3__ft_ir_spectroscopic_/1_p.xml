<p>The formation of nanoemulsion and nanoparticles require slightly effective conditions for better preparation. To understand the nature, stability, and formulation of the nanoemulsion, FT-IR was carried out for the characteristic changes. FT-IR spectra of DM plant, DM-ZnO NPs, and DM-ZnO-Try NE along with standard tryptophan were performed and represented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-00824-f003">Figure 3</xref>. Both NPs and NE showed the characteristic peaks for functional groups of DMs, which had phenolic (-OH group) at 3400.0 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and secondary amine (-NH) along with the absorbance at 2850 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and 2350 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> corresponding to –CH stretch and –C=O stretching. Stretching vibration -C=C was confirmed by the presence of signals at 1500 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. Both NP and NE exhibit the characteristic absorbance peaks concerning plant extract. Sharp peaks for tryptophan and nanoemulsion were compared for the characteristic peaks and these observations further confirmed the successful completion [
