<p>The effects of DM-ZnO-Try NE on cytotoxicity of 3T3-L1 preadipocyte and RAW 264.7 cells are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-00824-f008">Figure 8</xref>. To check for potential toxicity of DM-ZnO-Try NE on 3T3-L1 and RAW 264.7 cells, viability after exposure to a series of concentrations, and for two (3 h and 24 h) function of time, was determined using the MTT(3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. The various concentrations (0, 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, and 25 mg/mL) of DM-ZnO-Try NE did not affect cell viability of the RAW 264.7 cells compared with the control till 12.5 mg/mL as demonstrated in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-00824-f008">Figure 8</xref>, 3T3-L1 cells treated with various concentrations of different samples (DM extract, DM-ZnO NPs, DM-ZnO-Try NE, and Try) showed that the tested compound was not remarkably toxic until 6.25 μg/mL to 12 μg/mL of DM-ZnO-Try NE, where more than 80% of cells were viable. Therefore, further, we used 10 mg/mL (concentration between 3.125 and 12 mg/mL or the nearest concentration to 12 mg/mL) and 12 mg/mL of DM-ZnO-Try NE for the trypan blue toxicity assay. The trypan blue assay was shown in
