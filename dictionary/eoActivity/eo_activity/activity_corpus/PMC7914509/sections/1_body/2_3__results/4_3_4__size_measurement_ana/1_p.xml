<p>The hydrodynamic size of the prepared nanoparticles and nanoemulsion were determined using DLS analysis using 1 mg/mL concentration in water (pH7.4) at around 25 °C. DM-ZnO NPs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-00824-f004">Figure 4</xref>A) possess about 146.26 ± 3.3 nm with a PDI value of about 0.5 and the tryptophan entrapped using the oil and water method nanoemulsion product of DM-ZnO-Try NE (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-00824-f004">Figure 4</xref>B) possesses about 151.16 ± 3.6 nm with the PDI value of about 0.13 due to the coloading of the new moiety. The surface charges of both nanoparticles and nanoemulsion products are determined using a Zeta analyzer. DM-ZnO NPs and DM-ZnO-Try NE were confirmed as −13.06 ± 0.3 mV, which confirms the effective loading and the stability of the nanoemulsion product prepared and shows no significant changes in the zeta potentials were observed. The negative surface is due to the presence of various polyphenols from the OH−, COO−, and CO− of DM extract. This negative charge ZnO NPs associated with aiding the dispersity of the particles and prevents the surface attachments and thereby stabilizes the nanoparticles without any aggregation due to their electrostatic repulsions [
