<p>In this experiment, 20 µl of LO at a concentration of 10 g/L was mixed with 2 ml of distilled water and 100 µl of folic acid reagent. After 3 min, 300 μl of sodium carbonate (Na
 <sub>2</sub>Co3) solution was added to them, and the solution was stirred for 2 hr, and finally, the absorbance of the solution was measured at 765 nm by spectrophotometer. The amount of the total phenolic content was determined as mg of gallic acid equivalent (GAE) by means of gallic acid calibration curve. Total phenolic content was reported as mg of gallic acid per gram (Alizadeh Behbahani et al.,
