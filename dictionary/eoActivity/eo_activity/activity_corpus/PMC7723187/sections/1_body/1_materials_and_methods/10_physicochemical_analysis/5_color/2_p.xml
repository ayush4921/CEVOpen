<p>The color of the coated ostrich meat samples was measured by a Hunter Lab color meter (Konica Minolta, CR‐400, JP) and was reported by the CIE system. The colorimeter was calibrated with a white standard. The values of 
 <italic>L</italic>*, 
 <italic>a</italic>*, and 
 <italic>b</italic>*, respectively, which represent the brightness of 
 <italic>L</italic> from black (zero) to white (100), reds from green (negative values) to red (positive values), and yellow 
 <italic>b</italic> from blue (negative values) to yellow (positive values), were measured. ∆
 <italic>E</italic> (overall color change) was also investigated (Tahmasebi‐Pour et al.,
