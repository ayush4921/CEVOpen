<p>Ostrich meat samples were taken for microbial analysis on days 0 (after dipping treatment), 3, 6, and 9 days of refrigerated storage. Microbial culture was performed according to Alizadeh Behbahani and Imani Fooladi (
 <xref rid="fsn31940-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2018b</xref>). For this purpose, each of the uncoated (control), QSSM, and QSSM + LO samples containing 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, and 2% essential oil was thoroughly beaten by sterile Chinese mortar. Then, 5 g of the samples was removed and mixed with 45 ml of sterile physiological serum. The solutions were thoroughly mixed with vertex for 5 min and diluted to 10
 <sup>–1</sup>. Then, 1 ml of the solution was removed and mixed with 9 ml of sterile physiological serum and diluted to 10
 <sup>–2</sup>. Next, subsequent dilutions (10
 <sup>–1</sup> to 10
 <sup>–9</sup>) were prepared in the test tubes. Dilutions were obtained for each sample separately. Then, 100 µl dilutions were removed and microbial counts were investigated by microbial culture according to the following methods:
