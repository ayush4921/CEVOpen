<p>One of the problems that may occur when training a neural network is network learning. In this case, the error is acceptable when training the network, but when evaluating, the network error is much more than the error of the training data. There are two ways to avoid overlearning: 1—to stop training; 2—to choose the lowest number of neurons in the hidden layer. The second method was used in this study. In order to train the network, the data were first randomly divided into three parts, with 60% of the data used for training, 20% of the data used for evaluation, and 20% of the data used for network testing. During network training, the training process was interrupted when the error between training and evaluation data increased.</p>
