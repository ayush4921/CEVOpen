<p>The results of counting the total number of ostrich meat coliform bacteria maintained at 4°C are given in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31940-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>. The initial bacterial coliform count was 2.04 log CFU/g. The results showed that the number of coliform bacteria increased during the storage time in all treatments, but on day 9 of storage, there was a significant difference between the control sample (7.17 log CFU/g) with the samples containing 1.5% essential oil (3.8 log CFU/g) and the samples containing 2% essential oil (3.34 log CFU/g). The results of research by Seydim et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31940-bib-0059" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>) showed that using vacuum packaging containing rosemary essential oil and sodium lactate and their mixture, the number of coliform bacteria of ostrich meat reduced as compared to the control sample during the storage time at 3°C. Jebelli Javan et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31940-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>) investigated the effect of chitosan and 
 <italic>Trachyspermum ammi</italic> essential oil on microbial growth, proteolytic spoilage, lipid oxidation, and sensory attributes of chicken fillet during refrigerated storage for 12 days. The results showed that the use of chitosan edible coating containing 
 <italic>Trachyspermum ammi</italic> essential oil significantly reduced coliform bacteria as compared to the control sample. But the number of coliform bacteria in the coated sample without essential oil was not significantly different from the control sample.
