<p>Analysis of essential oil from lavender was performed by GC/MS device. The results of this analysis showed the presence of 12 compounds in the essential oil, which accounted for a total of 99.41% of the essential oils. The most representative compounds of LO were monoterpene, and among them, the main constituents were linalool (43.3%), linalyl acetate (19.1%), β‐myrcene (11.61%), D‐limonene (5.43%), and 1,3,6‐octatriene (5.31%) (Table
