<p>The proximate chemical analysis of the ostrich meat was determined as follows: moisture (75.01 ± 0.01), protein (22.96 ± 0.02), fat (0.9 ± 0.01), and ash (1.13 ± 0.09). The lower fat content along with the higher protein content is of particular interest of the ostrich meat. In fact, the fat/protein ratio definitely favors ostrich meat. The percentage of each ingredient was similar to those previously reported by Paleari et al. (

 <xref rid="fsn31940-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). The difference in the chemical composition of ostrich meat depends on several factors. Among them, nutrition, age, slaughter time, and environmental conditions are the most important factors which cause variations in different regions (Alizadeh Behbahani et al.,
