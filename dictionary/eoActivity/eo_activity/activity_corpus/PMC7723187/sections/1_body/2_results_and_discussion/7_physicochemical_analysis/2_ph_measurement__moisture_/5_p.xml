<p>The results of texture evaluation of the ostrich meat maintained at 4°C are presented in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31940-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>. The results of analysis of variance showed that the hardness of all samples decreased with passing time. On day 9, the hardness of all samples showed a significant difference (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05). In the QSSM + LO samples, the hardness increased on day 3 of the storage and then decreased on days 6 and 9. No significant difference (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05) was observed in the QSSM samples on days 1 and 3, but on days 6 and 9, the hardness decreased (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31940-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>).
