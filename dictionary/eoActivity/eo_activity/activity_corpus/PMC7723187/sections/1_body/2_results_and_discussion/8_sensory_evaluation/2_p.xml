<p>The results of sensory evaluation (color, aroma, and overall acceptability) of ostrich meat samples kept at 4°C are shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31940-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5a–c</xref>. In this way, ostrich meat samples with a score above 4 can be accepted (Hansen et al.,

 <xref rid="fsn31940-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Sensory scores (color) less than 4 were observed for control and QSSM samples on day 9. For the QSSM + LO samples, the retention score by day 9 was greater than 4 (Figure
