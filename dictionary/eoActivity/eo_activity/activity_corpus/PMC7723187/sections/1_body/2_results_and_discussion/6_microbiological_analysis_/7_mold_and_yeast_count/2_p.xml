<p>The results of the counts of molds and yeasts in ostrich meat stored at 4°C are shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31940-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>. The results showed that the initial level of fungi in the samples was 1.08 log CFU/g. Over time, the count increased in all treatments. The fungi are formed on the sample surface due to being aerobic. The presence of QSSM + LO reduced the growth of fungi due to the prevention of oxygen exchange (Heidari et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31940-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Microbial load was significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05) different in all days and in different treatments. Hamedi et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31940-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) investigated the antimicrobial effect of edible coating of sodium alginate and galbanum gum with 
 <italic>Ziziphora persica</italic> essential oil on shelf life of chicken fillets at 4°C. The results showed that edible coating significantly reduced the number of molds and yeast in the coated samples compared to the control sample at 12 days. Noori et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31940-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>) investigated the antimicrobial effect of edible coating of sodium caseinate nano‐emulsion containing ginger essential oil on poultry meat quality at 4°C. Their results showed a significant decrease in the number of molds and yeasts in the coated samples as compared to the control samples during 12‐day storage. Alizadeh Behbahani and Imani Fooladi (
 <xref rid="fsn31940-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2018b</xref>) reported a significant decrease in the number of molds and yeasts in beef samples coated with Balangu seed mucilage and Feverfew essential oil compared to control samples during 18 days of refrigerated sample storage.
