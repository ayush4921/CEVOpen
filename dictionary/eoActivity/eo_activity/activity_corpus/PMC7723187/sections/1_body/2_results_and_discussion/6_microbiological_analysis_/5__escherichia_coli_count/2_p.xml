<p>The results of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> count during storage are illustrated in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31940-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>. The results showed that the initial level of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> in all samples was 1.3 log CFU/g and the count enhanced with increase in the storage time. Adaszyńska‐Skwirzyńska and Szczerbińska (
 <xref rid="fsn31940-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>) investigated the antimicrobial effect of LO on 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Their results showed that the essential oil of lavender had a significant antimicrobial effect on both bacteria, but the antimicrobial effect of the essential oil on 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> was less than that on 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> because of its cell wall. Alizadeh Behbahani et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31940-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) reported that the use of 
 <italic>Plantago major</italic> seed mucilage as a novel edible coating incorporated with 
 <italic>Anethum graveolens</italic> essential oil significantly reduced the number of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> during storage (18 days) in the treated samples.
