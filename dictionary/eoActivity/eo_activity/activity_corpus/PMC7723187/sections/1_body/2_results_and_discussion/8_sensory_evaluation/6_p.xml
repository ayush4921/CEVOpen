 <xref rid="fsn31940-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) investigated the effect of using gelatin–Avishan Shirazi (
 <italic>Zataria multiflora Bioss</italic>) coating on microbial, chemical, and sensorial characteristics of ostrich fillets in refrigerated conditions. These researchers showed that the control sample had appropriate overall acceptability, microbial load, and physicochemical characteristics up to 3 days. Regarding the gelatin coating without thyme, it was also noted that it retains usability for up to 3 days in terms of microbial load and up to 6 days in terms of physical and sensory changes. For Shiraz thyme treatment alone, they reported acceptability for microbial load up to 6 days and for physical changes up to 9 days, while for gelatin‐containing thyme treatment, they found appropriate count for psychrophilic up to 6 days, mesophilic up to 12 days, and sensory and physical changes up to 12 days.
