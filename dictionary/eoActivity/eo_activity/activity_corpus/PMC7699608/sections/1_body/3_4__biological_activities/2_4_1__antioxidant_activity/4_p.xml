<p>In their study, Mighri et al. (2010) examined the antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of four essential oil types, whose major constituents were β-thujone, α-thujone, α-thujone/β-thujone, and 1,8-cineole/camphor/α-thujone/β-thujone, and the composition was investigated by using capillary GC and GC/MS technique. The results of the study showed that all examined oils had a great antimicrobial potential, and, in addition, they assessed the antioxidant capacity by different in vitro tests [
