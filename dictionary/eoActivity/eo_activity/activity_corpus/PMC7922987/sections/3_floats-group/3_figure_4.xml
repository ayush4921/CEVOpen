  <p>Effect of Fa.EtAc fraction of

   <bold>C</bold>) % Discrimination index were recorded in Fa.EtAc (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg)-treated groups versus scopolamine (Scop. 1 mg/kg)-treated group for assessment of recognition memory in mice model in behavioural NORT. The data are expressed as Mean ± SEM; each value corresponds to a mean of eight animals. One-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s post hoc multiple comparison test to determine the values of
