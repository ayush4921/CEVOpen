<p>In conclusion, the fraction Fa.EtAc having highest level of total phenolic/flavonoid contents resulted in good inhibition of AChE and BChE enzymes with low IC
 <sub>50</sub> values that also exhibited highest % free radical scavenging potential against DPPH and ABTS could be used as alternative drug to treat oxidative stress and neurodegenerative diseases. This extract has also exhibited nootropic and memory enhancing effect in mice model. In in vivo studies, it has exhibited strong antioxidant and anticholinesterase potential and was capable of reversing scopolamine-induced learning and memory impairments through reduction of brain cholinesterases (AChE and BChE) enzymes level. These results confirm the common use of 
 <italic>F. ammoniacum</italic> as neuroprotective and nootropic medicinal plant in traditional medicine. However, further work to isolate the novel and safe nootropic agents present in 
 <italic>F. ammoniacum</italic> and to understand the mechanisms of action responsible for these effects is needed. The findings of current study demonstrate the role of Fa.EtAc extract that probably activate the enteric nervous system signalling, increased the level of ACh and enhance neuronal activity that might be involved in memory processing.
