<p>Inhibition of acetyl cholinesterase enzyme can restore cholinergic functions and allow more retention of acetylcholine in the brain, which is essential for enhancing cognitive functions, learning, and memory. The present study validates the useful effect of ethyl acetate fraction of 
 <italic>F. ammoniacum</italic> on scopolamine-induced memory impairments. Scopolamine significantly decreased memory in rodentâ€™s model, indicating impairment in learning and memory in the behavioural Y-maze test. Our results were in line with the previous reported studies of other authors [

Scopolamine is a muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist which significantly causes memory impairments in mice especially in the progressions of learning acquisition and short-term memory. Scopolamine induces oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in the brain tissue which can cause chronic activation of microglia that disrupt synaptic plasticity and finally neuronal death. The ROS directly damage the neuron by increasing intracellular Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> level, while inflammatory cytokines are produced due to the activation of microglia that inhibit the production of BDNF and decrease the level of ACh [
