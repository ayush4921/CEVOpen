<p>The cholinesterase inhibitory activity of several medicinal plants has been reported in the literature [

 <xref rid="B44-brainsci-11-00259" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Additionally, antioxidants such as vitamin E and vitamin C low level are associated with incidences and prevalence of AD. AD patients administered with high doses of antioxidants were reported to have a slower rate of cognitive deterioration. Thus, the good antioxidant and anticholinesterase activities of the 
 <italic>F. ammoniacum</italic> extract/fractions in this study suggest that these extract/fractions are good sources of phenolic and flavonoid compounds, with potential cholinesterase inhibitory and antioxidant properties that may find usefulness in the management of AD [

 <xref rid="B44-brainsci-11-00259" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Furthermore, antioxidants and neuroprotective activities have been reported for the identified possible compounds in crude (chlorogenic acid, quercetin, mandelic acid, phloroglucinol, and hydroxy benzoic acid) and ethyl acetate extract (malic acid, chlorogenic acid, epigallocatechin gallate, quercetin, ellagic acid, rutin, pyrogallol), identified in other plant extracts. Among the identified phytochemicals; quercetin, chlorogenic acid, mandelic acid, epigallocatechin gallate, ellagic acid, and rutin has been reported as a potent antioxidant and neuroprotective agents [

 <xref rid="B48-brainsci-11-00259" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In this study Fa.EtAc fraction showed free radical scavenging activity and strong inhibitions of cholinesterases (AChE and BChE), with low IC
 <sub>50</sub> values. Reported studies also revealed that ethyl acetate extract 
 <italic>F. ammoniacum</italic> has shown the highest antioxidant activity in both DPPH and FRAP assays [
 <xref rid="B23-brainsci-11-00259" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Fa.EtAc fraction was found rich in phenolics and flavonoids that might thus be capable of reducing the risk of various degenerative diseases including AD, by prompting antioxidative activities. Previous studies also revealed that phenolics and flavonoids act as free radical scavengers of many oxidizing species and are inhibitors of cholinesterases (AChE and BChE) [
