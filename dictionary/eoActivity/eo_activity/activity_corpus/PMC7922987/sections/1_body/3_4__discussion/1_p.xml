<p>Different

 <italic>D. ammoniacum</italic> from centuries ago and its collection was started there from nearly 4000 years ago. Being rich in ammoniacum, the medicinal gum-resin has been used for the treatment of various disorders, such as upper respiratory tract, gastrointestinal and central nervous system complications. Several chemical compounds (terpenes, coumarins and phenolic compounds) with a wide range of pharmacological activities including antioxidant, anti-microbial, cytotoxicity, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, anticonvulsant, and hypolipidemic activities have been reported from this genus and are used in modern medicines [

Regardless of an extensive preclinical and clinical study to assess the safety and toxicity efficacy of such medicinal plants very few investigational studies are available. However, in recent times, there has been an increasing concern related to their safety and toxicity assessment [
 <xref rid="B39-brainsci-11-00259" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Such toxicity studies will enhance the public reliabilities on the herbal medicinal plants which would increase their traditional and beneficial uses. Due to the extensive use 
 <italic>D. ammoniacum</italic> in Persian traditional medicine, this study was designed to assess its nootropic effect in mice model. Before in vivo assessment, the chemical composition of 
 <italic>F. ammoniacum</italic> (
 <italic>D. ammoniacum</italic>) methanolic extract and ethyl acetate fraction (active fraction) was determined through HPLC and in vitro antioxidant and anticholinesterase activities were performed along with determination of total phenolic and flavonoid contents. Presence of phenolic compounds such as sesquiterpene coumarins, phenols, flavonoids and phloroacetophenone glycosides have also been reported from 
 <italic>D. ammoniacum</italic> and other Dorema species previously [
