<p>First the extract was evaluated for in vitro antioxidant and cholinesterase inhibitory potentials then behavioural tests like Y-maze and NORT were performed in in vivo model of mice and after getting promising results the mentioned potentials were checked in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. High AChE and BChE activities were observed in the frontal cortex and hippocampus tissues of the diseased control group (measured from supernatant part of homogenized brain tissues at a standardized protein content of 5 mg/mL). In standard control group (Donepezil) and test control (
 <italic>F. ammoniacum</italic> extract) group a significant decline in both AChE and BChE activities (

Reported studies also revealed that some plant extract significantly reversed the memory loss in mice model justifying its neuroprotective potential [

In the current study of NORT, the increase in the percent DI and exploration time with novel object compared to familiar object in mice treated with Fa.EtAc suggested improvement in learning and memory which is in agreement with the reported study [

 <italic>F. ammoniacum</italic> ethyl acetate fraction, due to their memory enhancing activity and nootropic effect. Nootropic agents or cognitive enhancers have already been reported in traditional medicinal system to improve mental functions such as cognition, memory, or attention [
