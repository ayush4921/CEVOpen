<p>The key clinical symptom of AD is a progressive deterioration in learning and memory function due to deficiency of ACh levels in the brain. Ach is an essential neurotransmitter present in the synapses. Its low level can reduce cognitive functions. Cholinesterase inhibitors are employed to reduce ACh hydrolysis, thereby increasing the concentration of ACh at the synapses and presynaptic receptors that prevents the death of cholinergic neurons [

AChE and BChE appear to be simultaneously active in the synaptic hydrolysis of ACh, terminating its neurotransmitter action, and co-regulating levels of ACh which is considered to be the most essential neurotransmitter that controls the regulation of cognitive functions. Increased AChE activity cause the loss of cholinergic neurotransmissions leading to Dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. Inhibitions of AChE decrease the hydrolysis of ACh in the brain and increase cholinergic neurotransmissions which might be helpful in treating mild to moderate levels of Alzheimer’s disease. In order to search out effective inhibitors of AChE and BChE from natural sources particular attention is needed in adapting an effective strategy to treat AD and that is by enhancing the level of ACh in the synapses of neurons [

The selected plant extracts provide a considerable source of secondary metabolites like phenolic acids and flavonoids which plays a role as antioxidant and as cholinesterase inhibitors. These phytochemicals are less toxic due to its origin from medicinal plants as compared to synthetic drugs and if isolated would be safer alternatives of the drugs to treat the neurodegenerative disorders. Present study revealed that Fa.EtAc fraction showed an excellent inhibition of AChE and BChE that might be due to the presence of anticholinesterase compounds (quercetin, chlorogenic acid, epigallocatechin gallate, ellagic acid, and rutin). Other plant in form of extracts have also shown anticholinesterase potentials for example,
