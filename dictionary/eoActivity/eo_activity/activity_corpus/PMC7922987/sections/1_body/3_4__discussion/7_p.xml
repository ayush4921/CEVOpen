<p>Behavioural study was further confirmed by biochemical assessment of brain cholinesterases (AChE and BChE) enzymes activity and DPPH free radicals scavenging activity in mice. 
 <italic>F. ammoniacum</italic> has clearly demonstrated anticholinesterase and antiradical activity with strong neuroprotective and nootropic potential. 
 <italic>F. ammoniacum</italic> inhibited brain cholinesterases (AChE and BChE) enzymes levels suggesting that its nootropic effects may strongly be due to the antioxidant action and, therefore, might play an effective role as antioxidant and free radical scavenger. Reported studies revealed that 
 <italic>F. ammoniacum</italic> gum resin also shows AChE inhibition due to presence of bioactive compounds [

This study is further supported by the possible involvement of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF; a neuronal growth factor) found in the brain, majorly found in the hippocampus, amygdala, cerebellum and cerebral cortex in both rodents and humans. BDNF activate enteric nervous system signalling pathways and synaptic communication which is released by the microglia mediated microglia-neuron signalling receptor. BDNF activates the neurotransmitter system and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) enzymes which synthesize the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh). Acetylcholine is implicated in cognitive functions and is a treatment target for many psychiatric and neurological disorders [
 <xref rid="B54-brainsci-11-00259" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Inhibitions of cholinesterases (AChE and BChE) probably enhance the levels of neurotransmitter (ACh) that might increase BDNF level. The donepezil and Fa.EtAc extract enhanced the Ach level while scopolamine a muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist suppressed its level in the cortex and hippocampus due to blockade of cholinergic signalling pathways, therefore, it is suggested that enhancement of neurogenesis by activating ACh is involved in the activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Although currently available therapies for AD are cholinesterase inhibitors such as donepezil and rivastigmine, which only reduces the disease progression and provide symptomatic relief. Efforts are still being made to find out better alternative and better therapeutic options. The probable mechanistic overview of major factors involved in the cognitive and memory impairments are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="brainsci-11-00259-f009">Figure 9</xref>. Moreover, based on the phytochemical, behavioural, and biochemical results, we hypothesize that 
 <italic>F. ammoniacum</italic> could possibly act directly as a free radical scavenger or regulator to inhibit cholinesterases (AChE and BChE), oxidative stress, and memory impairments induced by scopolamine. No memory impairments in the scopolamine-treated mice exposed to ethyl acetate fraction of 
 <italic>F. ammoniacum</italic>, were observed suggesting that 
 <italic>F. ammoniacum</italic> possess nootropic and neuroprotective activities.
