<p>ROS are constantly generated in redox processes during metabolism that attacks the biomolecules like enzymes, lipids, proteins, DNA and RNA resulting in an irreversible damage to these important commodities of life. Luckily, the human body can manage to cope with oxidative stress, through a number of defensive systems involving oxidant enzymes, and non-enzymatic compounds. However, in pathological conditions where excessive amounts of ROS encounters the defensive systems cannot properly manage the situations leading to chronic diseases like cancer, atherosclerosis, nephritis, diabetes mellitus, rheumatism, ischemic, cardiovascular disease, and aging. Oxidative stress also plays a key role in the development of neurodegenerative disorders like AD and Parkinsonâ€™s diseases [

The accumulation of ROS has been found in several chronic diseases, including AD suggesting that ROS may contribute to the pathogenesis of these diseases by inducing oxidative stress. Medicinal plants counteract the potential damaging effects of oxidative stress by the production of antioxidants. Previous studies have revealed that antioxidants have significant potential to reduce the symptoms and prevalence of AD [
