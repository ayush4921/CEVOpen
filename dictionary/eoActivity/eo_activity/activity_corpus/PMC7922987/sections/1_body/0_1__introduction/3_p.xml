<p>The association of neurodegenerative diseases like AD with some pathological conditions, such as impaired mitochondrial function, amyloids–beta (αβ) deposition, neuroinflammation, cholinergic deficit, and oxidative stress has been pointed out by many researchers [

In patients with AD, intense AChE, BChE and free radical activities have been found in the area of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Amyloids-beta (αβ) and cholinesterase activities may act as a physiological modulator of cholinergic function and induce neurotoxicity, alongside inhibiting the synthesis and release of ACh, resulting in cholinergic hypofunction, reduced neural efficiency, and cognitive impairment. These effects seem to appear in the cortex and hippocampus regions but not in other brain areas. αβ activates microglial cells to act as pro-inflammatory cells that secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines, which induces further αβ deposition. Microglia cells are the resident immune cells of the central nervous system which express surface receptors that activate or amplify the innate immune response. During cellular damage microglial cells respond quickly by inducing a protective immune response, which result in the up regulation of inflammatory molecules as well as neurotrophic factors. However, in case of chronic inflammation the prolonged activation of microglia leads to the production of a wide array of neurotoxicins, proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), and cholinesterases (AChE and BChE) in the extracellular spaces [

It has been proposed that the increase microglial cells activation in brain may be one of the early events that leads to oxidative damage and is considered to be the most abundant source of free radicals in the brain (such as superoxide and nitric oxide). Microglial cell derived radicals, as well as their reaction products such as hydrogen peroxide and peroxynitrite have been shown to be involved in oxidative damage and neuronal cell death in neurological diseases such as AD. Studies have shown that microglia cells play a role in supporting cognitive processes and homeostasis in the healthy adult brain while their absence results in cognitive and learning deficits in rodents during development. It also should be noted that microglial cells have efficient antioxidative defence mechanisms but when the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is prolonged, the endogenous reserves of antioxidants become exhausted and result in cellular damage [
