<p>Antioxidant like phenolics and flavonoids are commonly found in various fruits and vegetables and they have been shown to provide a fruitful defence against oxidative stress from oxidizing agents/free radicals. Oxidative stress is often defined as an imbalance between free radicals and antioxidant defence system. These radicals contribute to the development of many diseases including AD and can be neutralized by antioxidants. The consumption of fruits and vegetables are beneficial for health as they contain various secondary metabolites and other nutrients capable of curing a number of health complications [

Due to toxic effects of synthetic antioxidants; recent studies are mainly focused on their replacement with naturally occurring antioxidants from medicinal plants. Therefore, it is important to discover and isolate novel bioactive compounds from natural sources and evaluate their various biological potentials. Secondary metabolites like flavonoid and phenolics have great importance as antioxidants as they have high potentials of scavenging free radicals like ROS [
