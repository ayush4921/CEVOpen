<p>Researchers these days are in search of plants-based cholinesterase inhibitors and antioxidants which would significantly recovers cognitive decline. Although synthetic antioxidants are utilized in the food industry, but they have exhibited adverse side effects including liver damage and carcinogenesis. Natural sources, especially plants, provide a miscellaneous and largely unexploited reservoir of bioactive phytochemicals for drug discovery and for the development of new cholinesterase inhibitors and antioxidants. Previous studies have highlighted the potential beneficial effects of plants as vital sources for cholinesterase inhibitors [
