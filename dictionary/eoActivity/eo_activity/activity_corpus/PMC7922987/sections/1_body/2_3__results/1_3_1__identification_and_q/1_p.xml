<p>A typical HPL-UV chromatogram of 
 <italic>F. ammoniacum</italic> aerial parts methanolic and ethyl acetate extracts have been shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="brainsci-11-00259-f001">Figure 1</xref>. A total of five phytochemicals were identified in methanolic extract while in ethyl acetate fraction. The detailed identification of each antioxidant with their respective peak position in chromatogram and retention time (Rt) is given in 
 <xref rid="brainsci-11-00259-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Chlorogenic acid, quercetin, mandelic acid, phloroglucinol, and hydroxy benzoic acid eluted at retention times of 6.5, 10.5, 30.5, 35.5, and 36.3 min were present in Fa.Met, while malic acid, chlorogenic acid, epigallocatechin gallate, quercetin, ellagic acid, rutin, pyrogallol were identified in Fa.EtAc fraction at retention times of 3.1, 6.5, 8.0, 10.5, 16.6, 22.7 and 28.1 min. These compounds are the possible compounds as on same retention time different compounds can come out from column even under the same HPLC method. The concentrations of possible phytochemicals in crude extracts were: 9.203, 0.008, 0.014, 14.953, and 93.825 Âµg/mL (chlorogenic acid, quercetin, mandelic acid, phloroglucinol, and hydroxy benzoic acid, respectively) as presented in
