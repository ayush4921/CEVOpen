<p>Y-maze test results are presented in

 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) reduction were observed in the total numbers of arm entries in both scopolamine and treatment groups (Fa.EtAc and DZP) as compared to normal saline group (Normal control) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="brainsci-11-00259-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). Same returns percentages were recorded significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) high in scopolamine-treated group as compared to normal saline group. Fa.EtAc (100 and 200 mg/kg body weight), and DZP (2 mg/kg) exhibited significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) reduction in the percentage of returns to the same arm as compared to DW + Scop-treated group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="brainsci-11-00259-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). Similarly, Fa.EtAc (100 and 200 mg/kg body weight), and standard drug DZP (2 mg/kg body weight) significantly reverse the effect of scopolamine and have displayed a significant (
 <italic>p</italic> ˂ 0.05; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) rise in the percentage of alternate arm returns comparable to scopolamine. Although, DW + Scop-treated group significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> ˂ 0.01) decreased the number of returns to alternate arm at the percentage of 26.2% as compared to normal saline group (65%) (
