<p>DPPH and ABTS free radical inhibitory potential of Fa.Met, Fa.Hex, Fa.Chf, Fa.EtAc, Fa.Bn and Fa.Aq are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="brainsci-11-00259-f002">Figure 2</xref>C,D. The results revealed that highest percent free radical scavenging potential was exhibited by Fa.EtAc fraction against DPPH and ABTS with lowest IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 100 and 120 µg/mL, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-brainsci-11-00259">Table S2</xref>). Ascorbic acid was used as a positive control that caused 91.32 ± 0.34 and 95.31 ± 0.75 % inhibition at 1000 µg/mL against DPPH and ABTS with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value 30 and 45 µg/mL.
