<p>Cholinesterase (AChE and BChE) inhibitions of 
 <italic>F. ammoniacum</italic> methanolic extract/fractions were determined at various concentrations and are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="brainsci-11-00259-f002">Figure 2</xref>A,B. Among different fractions of 
 <italic>F. ammoniacum</italic>, Fa.EtAc and Fa.Chf showed prominent inhibition against AChE (89.22 ± 1.74 and 88.44 ± 0.80) at highest concentration (1000 µg/mL) with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values 40 and 43 µg/mL, respectively. Galantamine was used as a standard and showed percent inhibition of 96.56 ± 1.08 against AChE (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 30 µg/mL) at highest concentration 1000 µg/mL (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="brainsci-11-00259-f002">Figure 2</xref>A). Similarly, Fa.EtAc and Fa.Chf fractions also showed highest inhibition against, BChE which were 86.37 ± 0.61, and 85.31 ± 0.49 at highest concentration of 1000 µg/mL with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 41 and 42 µg/mL, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-brainsci-11-00259">Table S1</xref>). The positive control galantamine showed percent inhibition of 95.17 ± 071 against BChE at 1000 µg/mL concentration with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 32 µg/mL. Other extracts of 
 <italic>F. ammoniacum</italic> also showed a concentration dependent response against the selected enzymes.
