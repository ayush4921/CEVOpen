<p>The NORT was used to assess the recognition memory of mice after a single injection of scopolamine. The results obtained with the NORT are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="brainsci-11-00259-f004">Figure 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-brainsci-11-00259">Table S3 (Supplementary File)</xref>. There were no significant differences in the time spent in exploring the two identical objects between Fa.EtAc- and DZP-treated groups and scopolamine-treated group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="brainsci-11-00259-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). However, in the test phase Fa.EtAc (100 and 200 mg/kg), and donepezil (2 mg/kg) groups spent more time with novel object as compared to scopolamine-treated group (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). The administration of scopolamine before the retention phase of the test resulted in a decrease of the exploration time of the novel object in comparison with the familiar object (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="brainsci-11-00259-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). The discrimination index (DI) which is 0.46 + 0.03 in DW + Sal (Distilled water plus normal saline) group was significantly reduced (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) to a value of 0.07 + 0.05 in the scopolamine-treated group. The DI was significantly high for Fa.EtAc (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg) and donepezil (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) groups in comparison to scopolamine group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="brainsci-11-00259-f004">Figure 4</xref>C). The discrimination index of the standard drug donepezil group was 0.50 + 0.02. All groups showed %DI above 50% while scopolamine group has shown significantly low value as compared to vehicle control. The 
 <italic>F. ammoniacum</italic> extracts significantly increased the discrimination index from 0.16 in the scopolamine-treated group to 0.45 and 0.51 (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) in mice treated with Fa.EtAc at the doses 100 and 200 mg/kg, respectively. The exploration time of the novel object was also significantly increased by 
 <italic>F. ammoniacum</italic> extracts from 25.0 ± 1.6 in the scopolamine-treated group to 37.3 ± 3.5 and 38.5 ± 2.2 in mice treated with Fa.EtAc at the doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg, respectively (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). The Fa.EtAc (100 and 200 mg/kg) also significantly decreased the exploration time of the familiar object (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). The donepezil (2 mg/kg) groups significantly increased the discrimination index and the exploration time of the novel object (34.2 ± 1.2) and decreased the exploration time of the familiar object (11.30 ± 1.5) (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Here also, the effect of 
 <italic>F. ammoniacum</italic> extracts at the dose 200 mg/kg was greater than the effect of donepezil.
