<p>Results of TPC in the crude methanolic extract and various fractions of 
 <italic>F. ammoniacum</italic> aerial parts are presented in 
 <xref rid="brainsci-11-00259-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. A standard gallic acid curve was constructed by preparing the dilutions 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 mg/mL to estimate the TPC using regression equation. The phenolic contents of Fa.Met, Fa.Hex, Fa.Chf, Fa.EtAc, Fa.Bn and Fa.Aq were 68.25 ± 1.14, 65.55 ± 0.84, 75.12 ± 1.58, 88.23 ± 1.13, 55.18 ± 0.68, and 51.75 ± 1.87 mg GAE/g of dry sample, respectively. Out of them Fa.EtAc, Fa.Bn, and Fa.Chf fractions were rich in total phenolic contents.
