<p>To estimate the TFC in 
 <italic>F. ammoniacum</italic> aerial parts, the quercetin calibration standard curve was used for which dilutions 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 mg/mL were prepared. TFC were: Fa.Met, 66.97 ± 0.99, 68.01 ± 1.17, 77.83 ± 2.16, 85.93 ± 0.67, 45.51 ± 1.99 and 59.79 ± 1.39, respectively, in Fa.Hex, Fa.Chf, Fa.EtAc, Fa.Bn and Fa.Aq (
