<p>Brand-Williams assay [
 <xref rid="B34-brainsci-11-00259" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] was used to determine the free radical scavenging potential of 
 <italic>F. ammoniacum</italic> aerial parts methanolic extract/fractions against DPPH. The synthetic free radical, DPPH solution was prepared by dissolving 24 mg of it in 100 mL of methanol. The plant samples (1 mg/mL) were also made in methanol and working solutions were prepared using serial dilutions in the concentration range of 31.05–1000 µg/mL. About 0.1 mL of each working dilution was mixed with 3 mL of DPPH solution and incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. Absorbance was measured at 517 nm using UV-spectrophotometer (Thermo Electron Corporation, Beverly, MA, USA). Ascorbic acid was used as a positive control. All results were taken in triplicates and are presented as mean
