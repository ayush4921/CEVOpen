<p>The acute oral toxicity study on the plant extract (Fa.EtAc) was investigated according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guideline 423. All animals (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6) were treated orally with a single dose of 2000 mg/kg body weight of Fa.EtAc (the most active fraction) to 3 animals, and the other 3 animals receiving distilled water at 10 mL/kg to evaluate the toxic effects in any in the experimental animals. Immediately after dosing, the mice were observed continuously for 2 h for any symptoms of toxicity such as convulsions, loss of righting reflex, motor activity, muscle spasm, tremors, lacrimation, sedation, hypnosis, diarrhoea, and salivation. Mice were then kept under observation up to 14 days for any signs of toxicity or mortality. The Fa.EtAc remained safe and nontoxic up to the dose range of 2000 mg/kg body weight. The toxicity assessment was accomplished following guidelines of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The animals were administered Fa.EtAc 200 mg/kg body weight as 1/10th of the highest dose for multiple dose investigation to assess the in vivo neuroprotective and nootropic activity [
