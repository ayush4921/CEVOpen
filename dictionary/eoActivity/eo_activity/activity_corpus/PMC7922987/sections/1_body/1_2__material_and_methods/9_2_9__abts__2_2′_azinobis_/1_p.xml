<p>According to the previously reported Re et al. [
 <xref rid="B35-brainsci-11-00259" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] method antioxidant activity of the selected plant methanolic extract/fractions were determined against ABTS free radical. ABTS (7 mM) and Potassium per sulphate (2.45 mM) solutions were prepared and mixed thoroughly. For the production of ABTS free radicals in the solution, the mixture was kept in dark for overnight at room temperature. After incubation absorption of a 3 mL volume was adjusted 0.7 (noted at 745 nm) by adding methanol. To determine the free radical scavenging ability about 300 ÂµL of extract/fractions working dilutions and 3 mL of ABTS solution were mixed thoroughly and incubated for about 6 min. Finally, absorbance of the resulting mixtures was recorded at 745 nm using a double-beam spectrophotometer. Ascorbic acid was used as a positive control. Results were taken in triplicates and % ABTS scavenging potential was calculated using Equation (5).
