<p>Total phenolic content (TPC) in the extracts was determined using previously reported method [
 <xref rid="B32-brainsci-11-00259" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In this test, extract/fractions samples (100 µL), distilled water (500 µL), Folin–Ciocalteu reagent (100 µL), and 7% sodium carbonate (1000 µL) were mixed together and allowed to stand for 90 min. Finally, absorbance was measured at 760 nm using UV-Spectrophotometer. Gallic acid standard curve was obtained using the dilutions: 1000, 500, 250, 125, 62.5, and 31.05 µg/mL. The TPC was expressed as mg of gallic acid equivalent per gram (mg GAE/g) of dry sample (averaged from three parallel measurements).
