<p>The collected samples were cleaned and kept on a clean paper to shade dried for 20 days. The dried aerial parts sample were crushed through mechanical grinder. Approximately 3 kg of powder sample were subjected to maceration in 80% methanol for 14 days with periodical shaking [

The filtrate was concentrated into a semisolid mass using rotary evaporator (Heidolph Laborota 4000, Schwabach, Germany) under reduced pressure and then completely dried through lyophiliser. The semisolid mass was then solidified (280 g end yield product) in open air. The crude methanolic extract (Fa.Met) 250 g was subjected to fractionation using solvent-solvent extraction procedure starting from a low polarity solvent to highly polar one. The final yield of
