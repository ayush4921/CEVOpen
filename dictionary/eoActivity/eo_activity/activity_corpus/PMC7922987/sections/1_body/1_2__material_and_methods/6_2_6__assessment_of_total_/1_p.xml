<p>Total flavonoids contents (TFC) in 
 <italic>F. ammoniacum</italic> aerial parts extract/fractions were calculated using previously reported method [
 <xref rid="B32-brainsci-11-00259" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Quercetin was used as a standard and TFC was determined as mg of Quercetin equivalent (mg QE/g) per gram of dry sample of extract/fractions. A calibration curve for Quercetin was obtained using their various dilutions (1000, 500, 250, 125, 62.5, and 31.05 µg/mL). about 100 µL from each sample dilutions were taken and mixed with distilled water (500 µL), 5% sodium nitrate (100 µL), 10% aluminum chloride (150 µL) solution, and 1 M sodium hydroxide (200 µL), then allowed to stand for 5 min and its absorbance was recorded at 510 nm using UV-Spectrophotometer. All results were taken in triplicate.
