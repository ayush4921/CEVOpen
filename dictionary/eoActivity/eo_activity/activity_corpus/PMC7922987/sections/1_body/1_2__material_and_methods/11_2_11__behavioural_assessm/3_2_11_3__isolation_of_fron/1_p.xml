<p>Immediately after the Y-Maze test and NORT, all the animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation before decapitation to provide each animal with a quick and painless death according to the procedure illustrated in schedule-1 of UK (animal scientific procedure act 1986) and the brain of each animal was carefully isolated. The frontal cortex (FC) and hippocampus (HC) were dissected out in ice cold phosphate buffer saline (0.1 M; pH 8.0). The tissues were weighed and 20 mg tissue/mL homogenate of brain samples was prepared by homogenizing the isolated parts in phosphate buffer (pH 8.0). The homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and finally supernatants were collected at a standardized protein content of 5 mg/mL that was used for the estimation of ex vivo cholinesterase activity following Elman’s assay [
