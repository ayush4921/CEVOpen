<p>Ellman assay [
 <xref rid="B33-brainsci-11-00259" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] was used to assess the 
 <italic>F. ammoniacum</italic> aerial parts methanolic extract/fractions for their cholinesterase inhibition potentials. About 205 µL extract/fractions and 5 µL of AChE (0.03 U/mL)/BChE (0.01 U/mL) along with 5 µL DTNB were taken in a cuvette and incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. After incubation, 5 µL acetylthiocholine iodide or butyrylthiocholine iodide (substrate) were added to the mixture that resulted in yellow coloration due to formation of 5-Thio-2-nitro benzoate anion. Then, the absorbance of the resulting mixture was measured at 412 nm through double beam spectrophotometer (Thermo electron-corporation, Waltham, MA, USA). As a negative control, a solution containing all the above-mentioned components except plant extracts/fractions were mixed together. The same procedure mentioned above was used to constitute the reaction mixture of positive control galantamine and absorbance was measured at 412 nm. For each sample, absorbance was recorded for 4 min. Percent enzyme activity and inhibition potential of both enzymes were measured using the following formulae:
