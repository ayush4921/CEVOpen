<p>All experiments were performed on a Waters HPLC system equipped with a quaternary pump (model 600), photodiode array detector (PDA, model 996), manual injector and an XBridgeTM BEH Shield RP18 column, (130 Å, 5 µm, 4.6 mm × 250 mm, Waters) at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. The mobile phase consisted of (A) acetonitrile and (B) water (0.1% formic acid) the following gradient elution program was used: 20–40% A for 0–10 min, 40–100% A for 10–23 min, 100% A for 23–24 min, and 100–20% A for 24–28 min, 20% A for 28–30 min, the injection volume was 20 μL. The UV detector was set at a monitoring wavelength of 327 nm. System control, data collection, and data processing were accomplished using Waters Empower 2 chromatography software.</p>
