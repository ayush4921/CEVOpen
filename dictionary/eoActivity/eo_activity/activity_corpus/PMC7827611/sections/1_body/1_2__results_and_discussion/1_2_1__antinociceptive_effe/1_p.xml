<p>The use of infusions and poultices of 
 <italic>B. heterophylla</italic> for treating painful complaints led us to evaluate the antinociceptive activity of an AE and EO obtained from the plant’s aerial parts using the formalin test. This test is regarded as a satisfactory laboratory model for the study of nociception as it encompasses inflammatory, neurogenic, and central mechanisms of nociception. The formalin test is also a useful method for assessing the antinociceptive drugs and elucidating their action mechanisms [
 <xref rid="B15-plants-10-00116" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The first phase reflects centrally mediated pain with the release of substance P and bradykinin, while the second is due to release of histamine, serotonin, nitric oxide, bradykinin, and prostaglandins [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00116-f001">Figure 1</xref>A), the effect was only observed at the highest dose (316 mg/kg); the highest responses in the second phase was observed at the doses of 100 and 316 mg/kg, which reduced the licking time significantly. The results were comparable to the action produced by diclofenac (DIC, 50 mg/kg), employed as a positive control drug. On the other hand, intraplantar pretreatment of mice with EO (30–177 µg/paw) also decreased the nociceptive response in both phases of the formalin test (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00116-f001">Figure 1</xref>B); in the first stage, the highest effect was observed at the concentration of 30 µg/paw, but in the second phase the antinociceptive action was more pronounced at the concentrations of 100 and 177 µg/paw, the results were comparable to the effect produced by positive control (DIC, 100 µg/paw). The overall outcomes suggested that the aqueous extract and essential oil of 
 <italic>B. heterophylla</italic> exhibited antinociceptive action in both phases of the formalin test.
