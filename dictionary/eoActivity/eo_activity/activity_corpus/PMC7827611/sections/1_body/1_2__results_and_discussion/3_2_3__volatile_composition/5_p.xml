 <xref rid="B32-plants-10-00116" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. α-Pinene decreased the LPS-induced production of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and inhibited the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) [

 <xref rid="B34-plants-10-00116" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Besides, myrcene and limonene inhibited IL-1β-induced nitric oxide production in human chondrocytes [
 <xref rid="B35-plants-10-00116" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Finally, limonene exerted anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive effects in vivo (particularly in chemical models of nociception in mice) and in vitro assays mainly by modulating the action of cytokines and participating in pathways that are closely linked to the inflammatory response [
