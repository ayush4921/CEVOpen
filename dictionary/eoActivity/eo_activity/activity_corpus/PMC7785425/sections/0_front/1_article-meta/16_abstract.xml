 <p>Urinary tract infections are second most important diseases worldwide due to the increased amount of antibiotic resistant microbes. Among the Gram negative bacteria, 
  <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> is the dominant biofilm producer in urinary tract infections next to 
  <italic>E. coli</italic>. Biofilm is a process that produced self-matrix of more virulence pathogens on colloidal surfaces. Based on the above fact, this study was concentrated to inhibit the 
  <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> biofilm formation by various 
  <italic>in-vitro</italic> experiments. In the current study, the anti-biofilm effect of essential oils was recovered from the medicinal plant of 
  <italic>Solanum nigrum,</italic> and confirmed the available essential oils by liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy analysis. The excellent anti-microbial activity and minimum biofilm inhibition concentration of the essential oils against 
  <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> was indicated at 200 µg/mL. The absence of viability and altered exopolysaccharide structure of treated cells were showed by biofilm metabolic assay and phenol–sulphuric acid method. The fluorescence differentiation of 
  <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> treated cells was showed with more damages by confocal laser scanning electron microscope. Further, more morphological changes of essential oils treated cells were differentiated from normal cells by scanning electron microscope. Altogether, the results were reported that the 
  <italic>S. nigrum</italic> essential oils have anti-biofilm ability.
