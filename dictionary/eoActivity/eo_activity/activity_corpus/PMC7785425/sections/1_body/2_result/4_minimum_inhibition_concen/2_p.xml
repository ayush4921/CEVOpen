<p id="p0075">In 200 µg/mL concentration, the MIC was showed with more turbidity in SNEOs treated well compared with other wells. It confirmed that the SNEOs are very effective against

 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The O.D values of treated and untreated results were converted to percentage of inhibition with triplicate value as 94%. Initially, the inhibition was started at only 25 µg/mL only. When we added increased concentration, the turbidity also increased and it declared, the SNEOs are concentration dependent inhibitor. But, compared with previous reports, the concentration was very low (
 <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">Xinjun et al., 2020</xref>). The half inhibition percentage was identified in 60 µg/mL concentration. Previously, the SNEOs against tested various bacteria was reported at higher concentration (
 <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">da Silva et al., 2019</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2019</xref>). Based on the MIC, the result was confirmed that the SNEOs have anti-biofilm effect at minimum concentration and this 200 µg/mL was finalized as a biofilm inhibition concentration (BIC). This BIC was used for all invitro inhibition studies.
