<p id="p0085">The inhibition of physical barrier in bacteria as EPS was final confirmation result for biofilm inhibition. If the bacteria have the ability to form biofilm, initially it developed the fence against foreign drugs and antibiotics. Also, it extended their role into the nucleic acid and damaged the cells frequently. It leads to bacterial suppression, membrane damages, and intracellular granules leakages (
 <xref rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr">Banu et al., 2018</xref>). EPS has rich polysachharides and helped to form a ring around the bacterial DNA, nucleic acid, and other cell wall degraded materials within the bacteria and produce the sensitive enzymes and proteins against external drugs and antibiotics (
 <xref rid="b0210" ref-type="bibr">Dipti Mayee et al., 2020</xref>). Previously, 
 <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">Maruthupandy et al. (2020)</xref> reported that the EPS is given size and shape for bacterial biofilm formation and it leads to biofilm matrix formation. Based on these concerns, we have targeted the EPS in our study using SNEOs. The result of actual degradation effect in EPS was 94% at the 250 μg/mL concentration (
 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). The result was stated that the total virulence factors of 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> were lost due to the influence of in SNEOs treatment. The SNEOS penetrated into the 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> through cell wall and damaged the fimbriae, flagella and slime responsible proteins, and extended to intracellular organelles leads to DNA, nucleic acid damages. Capsular polysachharides mediated inhibition was very effective in biofilm formation (

 <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">Xinjun et al. (2020)</xref>. EPS inhibition is an essential key factor to destroy the cells completely within the biofilm matrix and extended target sites.
