<p id="p0095">The intracellular death of the SNEOs treated P. mirabilis was effectively viewed at the 40x magnification of CLSM. The BIC treated 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> was shown with increased cell death compared with untreated 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic>. AO/EB is a fluorescence dyes that used to bind with treated or untreated bacterial cells intracellular. In our result, the dye of AO/EB was entered into the bacterial cells and bind into intracellularly, and it glows on green colored emitted cells only as suggested untreated control (

 <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>b). The bacteria with rough surface, condensed structure and irregular shape of the 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> were seen at 200 μg/mL concentration of treated cells image. Instead, the smooth surface, normal bacterial structure with regular rod shape of the 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> was seen in untreated cells image. Therefore, the result was notified, the plant SNEOs has intracellular inhibition ability at 200 μg/mL concentration against biofilm forming 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic>. The previous statement was supported to our result, and the intracellular damage differentiation was identified by AO/EB fluorescence dye (
