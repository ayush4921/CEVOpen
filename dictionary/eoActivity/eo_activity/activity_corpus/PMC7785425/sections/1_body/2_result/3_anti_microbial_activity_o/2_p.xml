<p id="p0070">The improved effect of SNEOs treated biofilm forming 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> was shown 32 mm zone of inhibition at 100 µg/mL concentration was observed after one day incubation. In addition, the same plate containing normal crude extract of SN was showed with 16 mm zone of inhibition against 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> was observed. Whereas, the positive control and distilled water containing wells were showed with no zone of inhibition against 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic>. This result was suggested that the SNEOs were very effective against biofilm forming 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> at very least concentration of 200 µg/mL (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). At the same concentration, the crude extract of the SN was showed very low zone of inhibition compare with SNEOs. In addition, the no zone of inhibition result of ceftazidime antibiotic was revealed that the pathogen was MDRs effect, and the no zone of inhibition around the distilled water added well was proved that the dilution was not influenced in SNEOs. The zone was arisen from original SNEOs effective. The good agreement result was documented by 
 <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">Balakumar et al. (2011)</xref>, and the medicinal plant mediated EOs has excellent anti-microbial activity against MDRs strains. Recently, 
 <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">Ramachandran et al. (2020)</xref> reported that the EOs rich plant compound very effective inhibition in inside of the bacteria (

 <xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">Kavaz et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, our result was proved that the SNEOs were effective anti-biofilm agent against
