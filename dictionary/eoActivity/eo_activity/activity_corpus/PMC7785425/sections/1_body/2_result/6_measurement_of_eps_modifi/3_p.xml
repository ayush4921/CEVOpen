<p id="p0090">The 
 <italic>invitro</italic> EPS arrest method was validated by CRA plate method, and suggested that the SNEOs has anti-biofilm ability. Initially, the black color of the CRA plate was indicated as EPS production, later the black color of its pathogenicity was hide step by step using increasing concentration. At 250 μg/mL concentration, the black color colonies were completely arrested and it exhibited pink color colonies. The result was proved that the SNEOs have virulence factors inhibition. Because, it arrested the black color of pathogenicity in 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic>, but the antigenicity was still present in inside of the bacteria due to the production of pink color. At the same concentration, the bacteria 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> was lost their replication, nucleic acid synthesis and other responsible factors of virulence factors. Finally, the result was strongly agreed the 
 <italic>invitro</italic> EPS inhibition study and it suggested SNEOs has anti-biofilm ability against 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic>.
