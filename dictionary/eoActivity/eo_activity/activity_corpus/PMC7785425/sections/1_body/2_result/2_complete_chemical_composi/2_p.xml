<p id="p0065">After successful completion of LC-MS, the result was shown with more essential oils, proteins, amino acids, growth hormones and phytochemical derivatives. Among these, we have separated the EOs for this study. After screening, the 18 different essential oil compounds were identified based on the RT, % of area and occupation, % of occupation. In result, the terpenes was contain very high rate and supported by monoterpenes and hydrocarbons with sesquiterpenes derivatives (

Based on the highest RT, the EOs of β-Pinene, α-pinene, α-terpineol, β-pinene, Thymol, borneol, 2-Thujene, Myrcene, Octanone and Sabinene was highly correlated. Also, respective occupation area and occupation percentages were noted including 30.23, 28.16, 10.15, 20.40, 18.10, 30.10, 12.10, 10.02, 8.20, 9.10. Finally, the result was exhibited that the more EOs was present in the SNEOs. The present result was good agreement with earlier reports

 <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">Ibanez and Blazquez, 2020</xref>, and the presence of EOs was changed by region to region due to the various environmental factors. Sometimes, the genetic factors are influenced to produce native EOS in plant and it also has more biological properties (

 <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">Mallika and Chennam Srinivasulu (2006)</xref>, and medicinal plant of EOs has improved antimicrobial activity against MDRs bacteria. The unfavorable environmental condition, temperature, pH, carbon, nitrogen sources, NaCl content, humidity and various other stresses also influenced the native effect of EOs against various infections. Based on the above facts were suggested that the LC-MS was excellent analytical tool for identify the available EOs compounds in purified sample and it proved that the SNEOs has more antimicrobial derivatives of phytochemical compounds.
