<p id="p0080">The decreased bacterial cell survival of SNEOs treated 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> culture evidently indicated to in the 24-well plate culture. In biofilm inhibition research, the bacterial survival rate is essential step to detect the bacterial activity. Mechanically it was evident research, because all the virulence factors including enzyme production, ROS formation, QS production and specific gene activation were stopped their native role and inability to produce next molecules. So, the bacteria automatically lost their virulence in inside of the body (

 <xref rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr">Ying et al., 2018</xref>). In our study, deactivated survival rate of SNEOs treated 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> was indicated at 200 µg/mL with 92%. Before, the initial deactivated survival rate was indicated in 10% and extended up to with 92% of inhibition (

Result of spectrophotometer reading. The XTT result was clearly indicated that the SNEOs have the deactivated survival ability of 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> in liquid media. This result was most accordance with previous invitro result and the inhibition concentration as equal to BIC result. In good agreement result of 
 <xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">Milica et al. (2020)</xref> reported that the reduced survival rate of biofilm forming gram negative bacteria was identified after lost their pathogenicity. In addition, recent report of 
 <xref rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr">Kamila et al. (2016)</xref>, the viability based XTT assay is a perfect method to identified the tested materials nature. When the SNEOs don’t have inhibition ability, the survival rate of biofilm forming pathogen remains in same or increased. Therefore, our result was agreed the above said statement and clearly interpreted as the SNEOs as effective anti-biofilm agent against tested biofilm forming
