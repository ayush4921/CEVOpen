<p id="p0100">Weather the morphology and cell wall damages in the SNEOs treated 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> was evidently proved by SEM. In SEM, the fixed cells were degraded by ethanol gradient series with degradation (
 <xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). In this step, the adherent bacteria were utilized the ethanol and anchored the cover slip tightly in live condition. Consecutively, the death cells were abolished by washing with phosphate buffer saline and distilled water (
 <xref rid="b0215" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). After t-butanol treatment, the cells were clumped each other and exhibited native structure (
 <xref rid="b0225" ref-type="bibr">Lindsay et al., 2019</xref>). Followed statement, the exhibited SNEOs treated P. mirabilis was showed more morphological and cell wall damages by SEM. The continuous development of belbing and shape modification was indicated as SNEOs effect (
 <xref rid="b0220" ref-type="bibr">Cansu Feyzioglu and Tornuk, 2016</xref>). In treated cells morphology was showed with some leakages material compared with smooth rod shape of the 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic>. In some places, the rod shape was changed and shown irregular morphology. In addition, the SNEOs attached cells morphology was shown with clumps of SNEOs and complete damages. Therefore, the SEM result was morphologically supported to CLSM and suggested that the P. mirabilis was inhibited by SNEOs at their respective BIC.
