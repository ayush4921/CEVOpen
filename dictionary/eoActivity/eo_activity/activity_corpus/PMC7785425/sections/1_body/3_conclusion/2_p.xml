<p id="p0105">After careful consideration with agar well diffusion and 
 <italic>invitro</italic> experiments, the plant SNEOs has increased anti-biofilm activity against biofilm forming 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> effectively. At 200 μg/mL of BIC, the bacteria were sensitive to SNEOs and lost their virulence factors. Initially, the anti-biofilm ability was proved by agar well diffusion method and BIC. In addition, the deactivation of bacterial survival and damaged biofilm structure arrangement was proved by XTT and EPS measurement experiments respectively. The microscopicy studies of intracellular and morphological modifications in the presence of SNEOs containing 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> was showed by CLSM and SEM. Therefore, all the 
 <italic>invitro</italic> experiment results were strongly supported that the SNEOs as a promising anit-biofilm agent against Gram negative bacteria, particularly for 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic>.
