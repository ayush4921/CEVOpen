<p id="p0010">The punches of clumped microbes covered into the self-produced extracellular polymeric materials are considered as a biofilm (
 <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">Fallah et al., 2017</xref>). It adhered on inherent or non-inherent surfaces with the coating model of different protein, polysaccharides, nucleic acid and various lipids (
 <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">Sahar et al., 2019</xref>). The formation of biofilm is depending on the presence of environments, when the favorable environment comes, the bacteria produced signaling molecules and connect each other, finally form biofilm. It is one of the chains like process, which always successful finisher against external antibiotics (

In this condition, the bacteria in inside of the biofilm is acted as a phagocytes role and leads to suppress the host immune system and antimicrobial chemotherapy (

Sometimes, the biofilm formation was mediated by important virulence factor of QS, which is used to formation of microorganisms each other through cell signaling molecules. Therefore, the new variety of antibiotic production is needed urgently to eradicate biofilm forming pathogens with alternative strategies (
