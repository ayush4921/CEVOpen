 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> was grown on 6-well plated containing cover glass for one day. The well grown cells of the cover slip were taken and washed using 45 of crystal violet degradation dye. After attachment of crystal violet, the cover slip was washed properly with phosphate buffer saline and double distilled water twice for excess dye removal. Then, the cover slip was put in dark room 10Â min and maintained black cover rolling for purity. Finally, the cover slip containing sample was viewed by CLSM through inverted position and mortality of cells were clearly viewed and compared with control.
