 <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">Xinjun et al., 2020</xref>). The plant seeds were collected from inside of the Bharathidasan University garden, Tamil Nadu, India. For the undisturbed seeds, initially washed with dist·H
 <sub>2</sub>O and followed by double Dist·H
 <sub>2</sub>O and put on shade condition at room atmosphere with 15 days. After incubation, used seeds were grinded clearly and put it in hydro distillation using solvent n-hexane. In 1L water, 50 g of topped sample was dissolved and maintained at 3–4 h distillation. Next, the EOs were collected and used in sodium sulfate for dry. Finally, the solution was filtered the EOs except n-hexane under reduced pressure.
