<p id="p0060">The size and shape of the biofilm forming 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> was morphologically viewed after treatment with SNEOs by SEM (
 <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">da Silva et al., 2019</xref>). The pellet of BIC treated biofilm forming 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> was recovered at 2,500 rpm for 5 min. After discard the supernatant, the pellet was washed twice with phosphate buffer saline and distilled water. After drying, the 10 µL of the sample was aliquot on cover galss and fixed by 4% formaldehyde solution for 3 h. Then, washed with phosphate buffer saline and water for unfixed cells. Next, performed the ethanol gradient serious degradation using 10–100% of ethanol series. Next, the t-butanol was added after drying the cover slip to maintain the live condition of bacteria. Finally, the t-butanol treated sample was maintained in deep freezer one day. After, the cover glass was coated with copper grid and viewed by SEM for damage and undamage differentiation.
