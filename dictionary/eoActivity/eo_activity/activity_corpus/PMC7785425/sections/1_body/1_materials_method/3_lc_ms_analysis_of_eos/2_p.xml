<p id="p0025">The complete available components in the extracted EOs were identified by LC-MS with the modification of previous report of 
 <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">Digambar et al. (2019)</xref>. Shortly, 1:1% of sample and dichloromethane were used for injection, 70Ev of EI mode with 1: 20 split ratio (Himedia, India) combined with split injector at 240 ℃. For chemical components separation, the 5%+95% of phenyl and dimethylpolysiloxane was used in the 40 m × 0.45 mm × 0.25 μm of HP-5MS were performed. In addition, the helium gas of 1 mL/min with initial and final temperature of 40 ℃ and 250 ℃ were used respectively. The oven temperature should be set as 4 ℃. Lastly, the injected volume of EO was mixed in the solvent of chloroform at the ratio of 1:10 in μl concentration. Then, the available phytochemical, secondary metabolites, growth hormones are scanned and done the process. The obtained result was compared with NIST library of Bharathidasan University, Tamil Nadu, India.
