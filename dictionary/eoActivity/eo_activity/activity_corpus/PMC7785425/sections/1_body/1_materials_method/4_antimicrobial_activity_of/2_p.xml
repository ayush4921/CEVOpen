<p id="p0030">Increased antimicrobial activity of extracted SNEOs against biofilm forming 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> was initially confirmed by agar well diffusion method (
 <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Augustine et al., 2020</xref>). The one day old culture of biofilm forming 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> was swabbed on muller hinton agar plate without any mistakes. Then, 6 mm of the wells were cut into the agar plates, and followed by added SNEOs till inhibition level of concentration. In addition, for the MDRs effect confirmation, the disc antibiotic model of ceftazidime was put on the agar surface. Also, D·H
 <sub>2</sub>O added well performed for negative control. The plate was put it in room with normal temperature for 1 day. Then, the zones of inhibition around the tested wells were noted next day and detect the SNEOs range of effect against biofilm producing 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic>.
