<p>However, it has also been suggested that the cytotoxic effects of EOs are mediated by induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) over synthesis and oxidative stress. A study performed with 
 <italic>Anethum graveolens</italic> L. seed EO revealed apoptosis in a 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> strain via ATPase activity decrease, chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, phosphatidylserine exposure, cytochrome c release and metacaspase activation. This study highlighted the role of L-cysteine in the prevention of apoptosis, which is a sign of ROS action [

 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-01093" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Several studies have suggested positive inhibition outcomes for aflatoxin with the application of EOs, such as 
 <italic>Chenopodium ambrosioides</italic> L., that suppressed the synthesis of aflatoxin B1 by the aflatoxigenic strain of 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-26-01093" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Similar results were also observed with 
 <italic>Zataria multiflora Boiss</italic> EO, which decreased the growth of aflatoxin in 
 <italic>A. parasiticus</italic>, indicating a link with gene inhibition of the biosynthesis pathways for aflatoxin [
