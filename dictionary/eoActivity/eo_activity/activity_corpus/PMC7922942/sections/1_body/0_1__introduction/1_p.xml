<p>Fungi are ubiquitous environmental microorganisms that may be categorized, according to their dimorphic morphology, as unicellular (yeast) or filamentous (molds). Almost one million mycotic species have been reported to exist in nature, with approximately 200 species identified as human pathogenic [
