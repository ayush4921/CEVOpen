<p>To date, our knowledge of the mechanisms of action of EOs is still minimal, with emphasis on concentration-dependence. In general, some apparent effects of EOs include loss of membrane integrity, reduction of ergosterol levels, inhibition of wall formation, inhibition of gene expression, and suppression of membrane ATPases and cytokine interactions [

As such, the effectiveness of the antifungal characteristics is believed to be associated with the properties of the respective major component, but standardization of assessment methodologies and measurement units is important for further comparisons and investigations [

Considerable research has been performed and reported on the possible utilization of these nonconventional approaches, mostly in the form of ointment, gels and others [
