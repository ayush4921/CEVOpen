<p>The search resulted in a total of 192 articles from the three search engines: Pubmed (42 articles), WoS (61 articles) and Scopus (89 articles). Nevertheless, 86 articles were identified with a refined search based on the availability of full text, peer reviewed articles and library collection access. Upon further assessment, only 41 full articles were found to be relevant and were included for final review (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-01093-f002">Figure 2</xref>). All of these articles were printed for further assessment. Upon conducting a thorough review, these 41 articles were classified into three categories: 32 articles were categorized as in vitro research, 7 as combination of in vitro and in vivo research and 2 articles as clinical interventions. Out of this, 5 in vitro studies and 3 combination studies were classified as descriptions of nonconventional technology (
