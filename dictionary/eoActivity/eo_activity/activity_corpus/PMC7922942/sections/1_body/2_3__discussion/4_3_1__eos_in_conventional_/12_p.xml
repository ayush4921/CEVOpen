<p>In combatting ringworm infections, 
 <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic> EO, ethanol and aqueous extract were tested for their antifungal activity. In the study, the antifungal activities of 
 <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic> EO (MIC: 40–190 µg/mL) were found to be higher than its ethanol extract (MIC: 40–770 µg/mL), while 
 <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic> aqueous extract had no antifungal activity against dermatophytes (MIC: 1550–3100 µg/mL). This study noted the potential of 
 <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic> EO as a topical therapy in the treatment of skin fungal infections. It also noted that both 
 <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic> EO and its ethanol extract could be further explored for their antifungal activities [
