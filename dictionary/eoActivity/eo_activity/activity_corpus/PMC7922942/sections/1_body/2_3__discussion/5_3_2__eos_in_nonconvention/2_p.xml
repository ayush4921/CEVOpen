<p>The potential of 
 <italic>P. betle</italic> EO in combination with polymer gel as a suitable dermatological formulation against multiple skin pathogens was studied. The reported results showed the highest sensitivity of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>A. niger</italic> toward 
 <italic>P. betle</italic> EO, with inhibition up to 24 mm and 20 mm when tested at 20 ÂµL concentrations, respectively. The inhibition zones were found to be less affected by gel incorporation, as confirmed by the antimicrobial results from the use of the final formulation [

 <italic>B. tripartita</italic>. An EO of 
 <italic>B. tripartita</italic> (BTEO) was obtained via hydrodistillation of the aerial parts of the plant, which were then transformed into a gel formulation. The authors of this study concluded that both active phytoconstituents of 
 <italic>B. tripartita</italic>, as well as the vehicle properties of the gel, contributed to the observed therapeutic activity. The highest inhibition was recorded on 
 <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> and 
 <italic>C. krusei</italic> with 3.7 mm difference compared to hydrogel without BTEO. Through the comparison, the hydrogel-based formulation combined with BTEO appeared to be the preferred mixture, exhibiting superior antifungal activity against all tested 
 <italic>Candida</italic> strains and revealing the oil as a promising anticandidal agent [
