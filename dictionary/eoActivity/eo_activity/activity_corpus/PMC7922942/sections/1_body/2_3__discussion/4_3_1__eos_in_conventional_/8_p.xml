<p>In addition to the species mentioned above, Lebanon is also well-known for EOs from conifer plants such as 
 <italic>A. cilicica, C. sempervirens, J. excelsa, J. oxycedrus, C. libani</italic> and 
 <italic>C. macrocarpa</italic> gold crest. The efficacy of such oils was evaluated against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and several isolates of 
 <italic>Trichophyton</italic> spp. Based on the results, the highest sensitivity was observed with 
 <italic>Trichophyton</italic> spp. to all tested EOs (MIC: 32–512 μg/mL). This study, however, highlighted interesting activity of a 
 <italic>C. macrocarpa</italic> EO on dermatophytes (MIC: 32–64 μg/mL), whereby each major component, as well as an artificial EO, were tested on 
 <italic>T. rubrum</italic>, suggesting a possible contribution of a minor component to the overall observed activity. The findings strengthen the potential of EOs of Lebanese conifers for use in antimicrobial preparations for the treatment of superficial infections [
