<p>Infections are typically defined as the acquisition of a microbe by a host, which results when the microorganism is not eradicated from the host upon direct contact, thus initiating disease [

 <xref rid="B102-molecules-26-01093" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. It has been observed that fungal infections are becoming more prominent; this could be explained by the sharp growth of high-risk populations and the application of treatment modes that allow for improved survival rate [
 <xref rid="B103-molecules-26-01093" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Several variations of endemic fungal infections have been observed with specific geographical distribution due to climate change, human habitats expansion, ease of travel and population migrations [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-26-01093" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. There are four key prerequisite criteria for fungi to infect humans: its ability to colonize or penetrate surface barriers, its ability to absorb nutrients via lysis and absorption of human tissue, its ability to counteract innate and adaptive immunity associated pressure, and its ability to grow at typical human body temperature [
