<p>Among the in vitro studies, 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp. infections were among the most common. The hypothesis of the previous study was that the spread of candida infections could be avoided in the occurrence of a healthy immune system, except when scrapes or cuts are found on the body [
 <xref rid="B105-molecules-26-01093" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Numerous EOs were shown to be suitable to control candida infections. Commercially available lemon EOs have gained attention and also been shown to possess antifungal potential against three 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species (
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, 
 <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> and 
 <italic>C. glabrata</italic>), where the growth of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> specifically was inhibited across the full spectrum of concentrations used [
 <xref rid="B79-molecules-26-01093" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. In another study, anticandidal activities were examined against 
 <italic>C. torulopsis</italic>, 
 <italic>C. stellatoidea</italic> and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> using 
 <italic>Physalis angulata</italic> EO. 
 <italic>P. angulata</italic> is an annual herbaceous plant in the Solanaceae family which is recognized for its medicinal value. 
 <italic>P. angulata</italic> EO demonstrated excellent characteristics as an antifungal agent against all three candida strains that are usually resistant to antibiotics. As such, additional research on its anti-infective properties is warranted [
