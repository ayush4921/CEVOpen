<p>Another study investigated the effect of two EOs (
 <italic>E. caryophylla</italic> and 
 <italic>M. sp cf piperita</italic>) on six human pathogenic fungi (four filamentous fungi (dermatophytes): 
 <italic>T. rubrum</italic> (1 and 2), 
 <italic>T. violaceum</italic>, and 
 <italic>T. soudanense</italic>) and two pathogenic yeasts (
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> 1 and 2). 
 <italic>Mentha sp cf piperita</italic> is a herbal plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family, native to temperate regions, with a fresh, sweet smell that is traditionally applied in the treatment of gastritis, muscular pains or toothache [

 <italic>E. caryophylla</italic> (Myrtaceae) (clove) is a tree of 10–12 m in height that originates from Indonesia but which is also harvested in African countries. It is widely used as a spice, as well as for the treatment of toothache and in infection remedies [
 <xref rid="B108-molecules-26-01093" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. The study showed that 
 <italic>Mentha sp cf piperita</italic> EO presented weak activity, with MIC of 2.5 μL/mL against 
 <italic>Tricophyton strains</italic>, while no activity was shown with 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> [
 <xref rid="B74-molecules-26-01093" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Additionally, 
 <italic>E. caryophylla</italic> EO exhibited the highest activity, with MIC and MFC of 0.25 µL/mL and 0.125 µL/mL for filamentous fungi and MIC of 0.5 µL/mL for both yeast strains, while the MFC value was 1 µL/mL for one yeast strain and was not determined for the second [
