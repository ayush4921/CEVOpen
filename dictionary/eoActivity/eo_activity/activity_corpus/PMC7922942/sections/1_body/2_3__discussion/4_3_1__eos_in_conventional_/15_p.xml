<p>In a screening of 
 <italic>C. lemon</italic> and 
 <italic>C. sinensis</italic> oils by disc diffusion method in combatting 
 <italic>M. furfur</italic>, the diameter of the inhibition zone was found to be 50 and 20 mm, i.e., greater than those of reference antibiotics, gentamycin and streptomycin, at 16.5 and 17 mm, respectively. MIC of both lemon and orange oil against 
 <italic>M. furfur</italic> was found to be 0.8 and 2.2 ÂµL/mL. These findings support the use of 
 <italic>C. lemon</italic> and 
 <italic>C. sinensis</italic> oil as a traditional herbal medicine for the treatment of 
 <italic>P. versicolor</italic> infection of the skin [

 <italic>Bursera morelensis</italic> EO indicated inhibition of all the filamentous fungi. 
 <italic>F. monilifome</italic> (IC50: 2.27 mg/mL) was the most sensitive fungal strain. This work provided scientific evidence for the antimicrobial activity of the
