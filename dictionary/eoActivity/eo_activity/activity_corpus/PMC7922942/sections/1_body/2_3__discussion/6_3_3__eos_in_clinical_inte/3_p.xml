<p>The second investigation focused on the antifungal activity of EO obtained from 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> L. waste leaves.

 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> L. EO exhibited positive effects against several human pathogenic fungi (Pandey et al. 2010). The selected patients in this study had been diagnosed with 
 <italic>Tinea corporis</italic>. 
 <italic>Tinea corporis</italic> is classified as a form of dermatophytic infection of glabrous skin. 
 <italic>Trichophyton</italic> and 
 <italic>Microsporum</italic> species were identified as the cause of this infection.
