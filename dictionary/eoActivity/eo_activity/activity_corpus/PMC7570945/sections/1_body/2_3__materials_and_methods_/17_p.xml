<p>We calculated Jaccard’s similarity index (JI) to compare data reported in our study with previously published data collected from neighboring areas based on presence/absence of the reported uses. We focused the analysis only on uses for human health because veterinary uses were not reported in all the other considered studies. The following formula was applied:
 <disp-formula>JI = c/(a + b − c) × 100
  <label>(3)</label>
 </disp-formula> where c is the number of species common to the two sites, a is the number of species used only in the site A, and b is the number of species used only in the site B.
