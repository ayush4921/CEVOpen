<p>In this study, the EOs from twigs and cones of 
 <italic>P. mugo</italic> showed a significant anti-inflammatory activity compared to the other two species of 
 <italic>Pinus</italic> investigated, while the EOs from needles and twigs asserted a strong cytotoxic activity on cancer cells. The former activity could be attributed to the high concentration of α-pinene in the EOs. This molecule is actually considered responsible for the inhibition of the secretion of several pro-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, other major compounds, such as limonene and δ-3-carene, could contribute to the down-regulation of neutrophil, resulting in a reduction of the inflammatory response.
