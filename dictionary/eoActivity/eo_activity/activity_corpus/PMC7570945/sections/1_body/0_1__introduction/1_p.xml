<p>Ethnobotany of mountain regions is receiving increased interest in recent years [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-25-04144" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] due to the growing awareness about the impact of global warming on mountain biodiversity and the issues of conservation and sustainable management of the landscape. Mountain areas are recognized to be an important reservoir of ethnobotanical knowledge [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-25-04144" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-25-04144" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The high diversity of habitats and the historical isolation of the local communities have led to a strong diversification of the local cultural heritage. However, ethnobotanical knowledge is disappearing in mountain areas of many parts of the world, particularly in developed countries, due to the ongoing socio-economic changes and the loss of ethnic cultures. This process has been widely investigated, since loss of traditional knowledge could result in declining capacities of local communities to manage and conserve their ecosystems [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-25-04144" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and, therefore, has direct consequences on the use of biological resources by the next generations [

 <xref rid="B6-molecules-25-04144" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. According to Dutfield [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-25-04144" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] the erosion of ethnopharmacological knowledge and the abandonment of traditional practices might also involve a loss of access to a stock of bioactive compounds potentially useful for therapeutic application and drug development. As pointed out in many papers [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-25-04144" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-25-04144" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], traditional knowledge may be an important source of information in synthetic drug development and in natural-product research. Several bioprospection studies aiming at investigating plant-based biologically active agents have been developed in the recent years; the first step, and one of the major challenges, is the selection of plants for pharmacological studies. According to an ethnodirected approach, candidate plants can be selected by using information collected in ethnobotanical or ethnopharmacological field researches and analyzed by using quantitative tools [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-25-04144" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It should be noted that traditional know-how is only a part of a large reservoir of available knowledge [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-25-04144" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], including database, books and journal papers; information reported by informants need to be verified and validated through a comparison with the available scientific literature [
