<p>Just like biotic elicitors, chemical compounds of abiotic origin and physical factors such as environmental stimuli have also been proven effective in the elicitation of plant defense and thus increased production of phytochemicals (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Halder et al., 2019</xref>). It is not possible to cover all abiotic elicitors in a single subsection, but for our purpose, abiotic elicitors compounds such as salts (e.g., AgNO
 <sub>3</sub>, CdCl
 <sub>2</sub>, etc.) and environmental stimuli such as continuous light/dark, different wavelengths of light, and osmotic stress, etc. have been employed to produce high-yield secondary metabolites in plant
