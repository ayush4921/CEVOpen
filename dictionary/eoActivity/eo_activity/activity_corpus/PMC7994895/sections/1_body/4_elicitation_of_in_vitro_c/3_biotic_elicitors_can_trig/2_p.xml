<p>Similarly, a higher yield of

 <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> through the application of 2, 3-dihydroxypropyl jasmonate (

 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Ferri et al. (2009)</xref> revealed that chitosan enhanced the production of important polyphenols, including stilbenes and flavonoids in cell cultures of

Plant secondary metabolites such as lycorine, reserpine, plant lectins, apigenin, luteolin, and quercetin (replication inhibitors of coronavirus) (
