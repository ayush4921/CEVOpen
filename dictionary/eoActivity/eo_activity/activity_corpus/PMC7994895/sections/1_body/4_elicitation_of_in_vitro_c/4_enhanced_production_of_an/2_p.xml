<p>Abiotic elicitation has been used for the enhanced production of important flavonoids such as hypericin and hyperforin in 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures of 
 <italic>Hypericum perforatum</italic> (
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">Shakya et al., 2019</xref>). For instance, 
 <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">Tirillini et al. (2006)</xref> reported that the application of chromium (0.01 mM) increased the production of hypericin by 38% in plantlets of 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> (
 <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">Tirillini et al., 2006</xref>). Compounds such as quercetin in 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> have been shown to act as potent anti-SARS-CoV compounds and their enhanced production through elicitation promises an avenue for high-yield drug production (
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">Ryu et al., 2010a</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">Shakya et al., 2019</xref>). A new addition to the lines of abiotic elicitors is the use of nanomaterials for triggering an intense plant defense response. For example, in one of our studies, we used silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) for the enhancement of medicinally important phenolics and flavonoids in callus cultures (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Begum et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, zinc nano-oxides and iron nano-oxides have been used to trigger the production of hypericin and hyperforin in cell suspension cultures of 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> (
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">Shakya et al., 2019</xref>). Apart from chemical compounds, environmental triggers have also proved to be valuable tools in plant biotechnology for the enhanced production of important secondary metabolites in plant 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures. For example, 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Khan et al. (2019c)</xref> showed that different spectral lights result in the enhanced production of phytochemicals such as myricetin and apigenin among many others. Myricetin is experimentally shown to inhibit the SARS-CoV helicase protein 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> by affecting ATPase activity and thus could have potential against SARS-CoV-2 (
 <xref rid="B143" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). Plants 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures can serve as factories for the elicitor-induced high-yield production of myricetin against SARS-CoV-2. In another study, 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al. (2016)</xref> used UV-B irradiation to cause flavonoid-related gene expression in hairy root cultures of 
 <italic>Fagopyrum tataricum</italic>. The experiment resulted in enhanced biosynthesis of rutin and quercetin in the hairy root cultures of 
 <italic>F. tataricum</italic>.
