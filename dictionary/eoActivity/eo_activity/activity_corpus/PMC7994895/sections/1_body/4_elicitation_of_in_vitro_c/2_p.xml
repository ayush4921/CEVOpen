<p>Being of biological origin (biotic) or non-biological origin (abiotic), the compounds or physical factors that stimulate the plant defense are termed elicitors. Biotic elicitors include compounds that are of the pathogenic origin or are produced by the plants after being exposed to pathogens. Abiotic elicitors include chemical compounds such as salts or physical factors such as environmental triggers (

 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">Srivastava et al. (2019)</xref> have successfully elicited the yield of glycyrrhizin in hairy root cultures of 
 <italic>G. glabra</italic> L. Through this study, it was proven that both biotic and abiotic elicitors are effective in eliciting higher yields of glycyrrhizin.
