<p>Apart from the diversity of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures, which can provide avenues for phytochemical compounds against SARS-CoV-2, enhanced production of these compounds is one area where plant biotechnology thrives. This enhancement is achieved through triggering or in other words eliciting the defense response of plant cultures, discussed in the previous section. To give a very brief overview of the mechanism of elicitation, the process starts at the cell membrane of the plant cell. Many different receptors are elicited to trigger the secondary metabolism for defense. For instance, the plasmalemma membrane-associated receptors attach the ligand or chemical compound (exogenous or endogenous). The signal reception is followed by transduction which includes steps like reversible phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of plasma membrane and cytosolic proteins, enhancement of Ca
