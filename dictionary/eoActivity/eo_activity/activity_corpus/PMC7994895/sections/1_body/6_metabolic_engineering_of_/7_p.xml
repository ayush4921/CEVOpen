<p>Resveratrol is another example of a natural product that is reported for its anti-coronavirus activity (
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2017</xref>) and has been successfully transformed via molecular engineering into plants that normally do not produce resveratrol (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Giovinazzo et al., 2012</xref>). This compound has been reported to be found in grapes, berries, white tea, and passion fruit, etc. in a very low quantity which makes its extraction challenging (
 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">Shrestha et al., 2019</xref>). Metabolic engineering has been performed by several researchers to improve its quantity or to express it in new plants (
