<p>Glycyrrhizin, an active component of licorice roots, has been reported to show antiviral activity against SARS-CoV 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Boccalone et al., 2020</xref>). This compound has been converted via biotransformation to several other compounds that are more stable, easily soluble, and having greater emulsifying properties than glycyrrhizin. Other advantages of biotransformation of glycyrrhizin include strong stereoselectivity and regioselectivity, low byproduct production, and increased activity (

 <italic>G. glabra</italic> and 
 <italic>Eucalyptus perriniana</italic> can transform glycyrrhetinic acid (a byproduct of glycyrrhizin) to several other important compounds. For instance, these include 3−
 <italic>O</italic>−[α−l−arabinopyranosyl−(1→2)−β−D−glucuronopyran osyl]−24−hydroxy−18 β−glycyrrhetinic acid, 23,28−dihydroxy−18β−glycyrrhetinic acid−30β−glucopy ranosyl ester, and 28−hydroxy−18β−glycyrrhetinic acid−30β−glucopyranosyl ester which are reported to be important medicinal compounds (
