<p>In an interesting experiment, 
 <italic>N. tabacum</italic> plants were transformed with the stilbene synthase gene from grapevine using 
 <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic>-mediated gene transfer. The transformed plants not only expressed the gene but also showed resistance to the fungal pathogen 
 <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Hain et al., 1993</xref>). Metabolic engineering has thus improved its composition as well as improved its level. Stilbene synthase gene (STS-encoding gene)-mediated transformation thus confirmed that plant molecular engineering with resveratrol may lead to novel functions such as resistance to stresses, fungal infection, or increased nutritional value. STS genes have been transferred to several other crops as well such as 
 <italic>Medicago sativa L.</italic>, 
 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana L</italic>, 
 <italic>L. sativa L</italic>, and 
 <italic>Solanum lycopersicum L.</italic>, etc. (

Commonly used promoters to control the expression of STS-encoding genes include the well-characterized constitutive promoter pCaMV35S, fungus-inducible promoter pPR10.1, stress-responsive promoter pVst1, and the tissue-specific promoter p-nap (

 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Fan et al., 2008</xref>). The increased nutritional values of several fruits and edible crops via transformation along with the higher yield of resveratrol can be exploited for use in SARS-CoV-2 management.
