<p>Ginsenoside (ginsenoside Rb1) occupies a unique place in the pharmaceutical industry around the globe as an active ingredient of 
 <italic>Panax ginseng</italic>. It has recently been reported for its anti-SARS-CoV activity (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Boccalone et al., 2020</xref>). While the traditional methods of isolation and purification of ginsenoside were challenging and time-consuming, the use of modern-day biotechnological approaches not only enhances its level but also makes the extraction process easier. These approaches include but are not limited to tissue culture, cell suspension culture, protoplast culture, polyploidy, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> mutagenesis, and hairy root culture (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Gantait et al., 2020</xref>). For instance, 
 <xref rid="B144" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al. (2016)</xref> have reported the enhanced production of ginsenoside by using a fungal strain 
 <italic>Alternaria panax</italic> in cell suspension cultures. The cell wall exudates fungi that contain oligosaccharides and chitin that act as biotic elicitors (
