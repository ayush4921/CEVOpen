<p>Despite drawbacks, attempts to overproduce a single metabolite or end-product have progressed in recent years and several examples can be found in the literature in which metabolic engineering of plants has been applied in the field of medicine. For instance, the production of genistein, an isoflavone, and a known antiviral compound has been shown in non-leguminous species in which this compound is not native. It was made possible by introducing the isoflavone synthase (IFS) gene from soybean (glycine max) to non-leguminous species tobacco (

Furthermore, to increase the quantity of genistein, anti-sense suppression of flavanone-3-hydroxylase (F3H) and overexpression of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) has also been employed. It is important to highlight here that PAL is an enzyme of the phenylpropanoid pathway that feeds into flavonoid biosynthesis.
