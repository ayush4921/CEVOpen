<p>Plant metabolic engineering could prove to be an important tool in directing a plant’s metabolic machinery to the synthesis of important natural compounds against coronaviruses. For instance, metabolically engineered soybean and canola produced a high level of monosaturated fatty acid which otherwise produces a high level of linolenic acid which is prone to oxidation (
