<p>Jasmonates have been reported to induce oxidative stress and downregulate many genes which lead to an augmentation of ginsenoside in the cell suspension culture. The mechanism behind the role of the elicitor mainly involve the activation of phenylalanine amino lyase which in turn elevates the level of defense compounds and hence ginsenoside biosynthesis (
