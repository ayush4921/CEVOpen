<p>Thus, an increasing interest has been observed focusing on 
 <italic>in-planta</italic> production of important metabolites via genetic and metabolic engineering. For example, genistein and taxane (precursors of paclitaxel) have been successfully produced in plants other than their native species. However, alongside attempting the increased production of certain end-products or producing new products/compounds via genetic engineering, it has been understood that biosynthetic engineering is a highly complicated process that demands diverse knowledge in all fields of biochemistry, biotechnology, and molecular biology (

 <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures for growing plant tissues could be manipulated through metabolic engineering for secondary metabolite production and its quantity enhancement, for example; adventitious root culture, callus culture, somatic embryogenesis and regeneration, cell suspension culture, protoplast culture, and hairy root culture, etc. (
