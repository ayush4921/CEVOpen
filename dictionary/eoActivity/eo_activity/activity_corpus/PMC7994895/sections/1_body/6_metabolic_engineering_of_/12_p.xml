<p>Mutagenesis and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures which incorporate genotypic changes in the culture is another popular method used for the enhanced production of ginsenoside. In this method, 
 <italic>P. ginseng</italic> calli are exposed to varying doses of gamma radiation ranging from 10 to 100 Gy (Gray) and for various lengths of time to bring genetic changes and hence to increase the ginsenoside level in callus cultures (

 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The increased production of primary ginsenosides was associated with the high expression of squalene epoxidase, dammarenediol synthase, and phytosterol synthase genes (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). Summing up, it can be concluded that engineering plant cell and tissue cultures, through 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> mutagenesis, direct gene transfer, and 
 <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic>-mediated transformation could play an important role in the production/enrichment of natural products that are easily repeatable in a short time and thus can be exploited in the fight against COVID-19.
