<p>The metabolic machinery of plants could be targeted for engineering at different points that ultimately result in either novel compounds or the over-production of important medicinal metabolites (

However, it can be detrimental as most of the time unwanted compounds are also administered. Besides, these compounds are present at low native concentrations in plants and most of the time is not as effective as a pure compound. Commercial extraction of any such compound from any plant species may have detrimental effects on the plant population and can even push a plant species to the brink of extinction (

 <sup>Â®</sup>) led to the endangerment of not only its source plant (Pacific yew) but also other species of the same genus (
