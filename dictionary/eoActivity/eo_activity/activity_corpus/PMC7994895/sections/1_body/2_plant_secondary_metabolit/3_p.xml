<p>Similarly, flavone glycosides, phenolics, and polyphenolic compounds which are characterized by aromatic rings and hydroxyl (−OH) groups have also demonstrated important antiviral activity in many studies. For example, three flavone glycosides, quercetin 3-
 <italic>O</italic>-rutinoside, kaempferol 3-
 <italic>O</italic>-rutinoside, and kaempferol 3-
 <italic>O</italic>-robinobioside have proven effective against herpes simplex virus and thus points toward their potential role in working against human viruses (

It has been suggested that the −OH groups inhibit the activity of viral proteins by forming hydrogen bonds with the positively charged amino groups of proteins. Additionally, polyphenols can intervene in the lipoprotein layers of the viral envelope and thus prevent viral entry in the host cells (

 <italic>Rheum</italic> and 
 <italic>Polygonum</italic> were tested positive for their achrysinctivity against the S protein and inhibition of ACE2 interaction (
