<p>Essential oils and terpenoids have an equally important role as antiviral plant secondary metabolites. Essential oils can enter non-specifically into the lipid bilayer of the viral envelope, altering the fluidity of the membrane and thus interfering with its pathogenicity even before the entry of the virus (

 <sub>50</sub> between 3.8 and 7.5 μM. Similarly, an important member of terpenoids, resveratrol has been shown to prevent the entry of MERS-CoV into the cell. Resveratrol fully prevented Vero E6 cell death at the concentration of 125–250 μM (
