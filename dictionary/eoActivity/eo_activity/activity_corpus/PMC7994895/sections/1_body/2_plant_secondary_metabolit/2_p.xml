<p>Alkaloids, for instance, are nitrogen-containing basic compounds and include compounds such as quinine, a bitter alkaloid isolated from the bark of the cinchona tree (Quina). A synthetic derivative of quinine, i.e., chloroquine has recently been tested and found to be a good drug candidate against SARS-CoV-2 because its DNA-intercalating properties prove potent in alleviating the symptoms of coronaviruses based on its biocompatibility (

 <italic>Rauvolfia serpentina</italic> (Indian snakeroot) has been shown to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV (the coronavirus that causes the first coronavirus-related epidemic of this century). Reserpine could thus prove to be an important candidate against SARS-CoV-2. Similarly, other important alkaloids, palmatine, and chelidonine were also reported as intercalating alkaloids and could be easily suggested as potential drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2 (
