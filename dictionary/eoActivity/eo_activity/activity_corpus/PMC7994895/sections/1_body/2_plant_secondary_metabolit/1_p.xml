<p>Plant metabolism as a factory to produce anti-SARS-CoV phytochemicals is an important area of consideration currently. It is important to highlight the antiviral potential of the main classes of plant secondary metabolites to understand the role of 
 <italic>in vitro plant</italic> cultures and associated biotechnological manipulation in fighting SARS-CoV-2. Plants produce a diversity of organic compounds classified as primary and secondary metabolites based on either being directly essential to the growth and development of plants (primary metabolites) or indirectly playing their role and not essential to growth (secondary metabolites). Secondary metabolites are produced in plants in situations of intracellular and/or extracellular stress and are used for interaction with the environment and protection from pathogens. This implies that there are thousands of secondary metabolites produced in plants, classified in different classes by their chemical structures. The four major classes of plant secondary metabolites are alkaloids, glycosides, phenolics, and terpenes. The purpose of highlighting the groups of these metabolites is to relate the role these classes of compounds could play against SARS-CoV-2. Several different plant-based compounds have been shown to be effective against the previous type of coronavirus, i.e., SARS-CoV. These compounds have been employed for their different mechanisms of actions against SARS-CoV (
