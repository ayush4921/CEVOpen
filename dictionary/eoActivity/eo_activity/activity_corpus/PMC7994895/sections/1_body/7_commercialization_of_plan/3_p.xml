<p>Commercial production of secondary metabolites largely depends either on higher market value or high demand which will undoubtedly be high if any of the phytochemicals tested proved effective against the current SARS-CoV virus. The continuous efforts in this field will lead to the controllable and successful production of specific, valuable, and yet unknown plant secondary metabolites (
