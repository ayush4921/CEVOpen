<p>Regarding commercialization, the most promising fact associated with plant tissue cultures is that they offer an avenue for the production of these medicinally important phytochemicals in an appropriate bioreactor. The production of the plant 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures is indeed an important prerequisite for the large-scale yield and commercialization of phytomedicine. This is linked with the fact that once carefully selected and optimized, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures of plants could yield ten times higher phytomedicine than plants grown naturally. However, the production of phytomedicine in bioreactors requires the selection of suitable cell lines/cultures, optimization of culture conditions, application of proper elicitation strategy, immobilization of cells, and efficient downstream processing (
