<p>Advances in biotechnological approaches, particularly plant cell culturing methods, provides new means for commercially valuable, medicinally important plant secondary metabolites (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Hussain et al., 2012</xref>). Different kinds of strategies have been used, for example, appropriate design of bioreactor systems, optimization of nutrient medium, highly productive line selection, elicitation, two-phase cultivation, and metabolic engineering (
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">Marchev et al., 2020</xref>). The scaling-up of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> plant culturing into large-scale, economically feasible bioreactors provides the sustainable and continuous production of high-valued plant secondary metabolites. Secondary metabolite production in bioreactors depends on pharmacological significance as well as human health benefits. The production of rosmarinic acid and saponins are the selected examples of the commercial production of secondary metabolites 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (
 <xref rid="B130" ref-type="bibr">Weathers et al., 2010</xref>). Different kinds of bioreactor systems are used to enhance the accumulation of rosmarinic acid such as hairy root cultures or shoot suspension cultures from different plants. Plant suspension culture technology offers a convenient way of upscaling plant 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> culture systems for the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. The ease of its upscale is attributed to its shorter cycle of production and simpler methods for bioreactor construction (
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">Marchev et al., 2020</xref>). The successful and rapid development of plant metabolic engineering offers an attractive opportunity to increase the content of secondary metabolites in cell and hairy root cultures from aromatic and medicinal plants at a feasible level. Moreover, plant metabolic engineering also makes it possible to understand the molecular biology of the biosynthesis of the secondary metabolites (
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">Pavlov and Bley, 2018</xref>). Ginsenoside and taxole, examples of successfully commercialized plant cell suspension cultures, derived specialized metabolites. As reported earlier (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), ginsenosides have proven to be effective against SARS-CoV in inhibiting glycoprotein activity (
 <xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2004</xref>). Although due to the limited understanding of the molecular basis of plant secondary metabolite biosynthesis, the widespread utilization of the plant suspension cultures platform has yet to be primarily realized (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Arya et al., 2020</xref>). However, with much research effort, many secondary metabolites achieved a semi-commercial status (
