<p>Treatment options currently explored include passive immunity (

 <xref rid="B128" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Vaccine trials are also underway and the Moderna biotech vaccine candidate mRNA-1273 (approved for use now by the Food and Drug Administration) which encodes the stabilized pre-fusion SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has provoked an immune response with no trial-limiting side effects (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Jackson et al., 2020</xref>). However, vaccines, based on their very mechanism of action, only prevent a healthy individual from getting infected. Moreover, a successful vaccine is not thought, at least soon, to be available to the masses. Similarly, repurposing synthetic drugs also became controversial because of their safety concerns and adverse events (
