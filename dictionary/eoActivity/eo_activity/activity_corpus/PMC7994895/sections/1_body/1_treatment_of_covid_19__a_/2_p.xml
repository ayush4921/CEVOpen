<p>The fight against COVID-19 has now become one of the greatest challenges of the current times. The pandemic has lasted for over a year now since its inception in December 2019. To date, over 90 vaccines are being developed for the COVID-19 virus by different research groups in universities and major companies. Currently, two vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and Moderna COVID-19 vaccine) have obtained emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration in the United States. Pfizer and Moderna have developed messenger RNA-based vaccines that have been shown to be 90â€“95% effective when given at preventing doses 21 and 28 days apart, respectively (

Some of the groups are even testing the direct injection of viral proteins that will help in eliciting the immune system and developing resistance against the virus. One fascinating approach is the use of genetically modified viruses to develop coronavirus proteins in the human body. The carrier virus will act as a vector, carrying coronavirus protein sequences in its genome. Currently, measles or adenovirus (where the viruses are weakened) is used in this approach to make either replicating or non-replicating virus versions (

The VLPs use genetic sequencing from the coronavirus to mimic it and produce an immune response in the body. Plant-based VLP technology offers a very safe alternative to the vaccines already approved or in the process of development. These vaccines are virus-free and do not rely on animal products.
