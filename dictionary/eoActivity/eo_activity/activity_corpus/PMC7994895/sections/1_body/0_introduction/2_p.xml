<p>Scientific advancements allowed researchers to advise governments across the world on quick prevention measures. Based on the rapid information coming out about the virus, including its transmission pattern, morphology, and deeper biological information, the World Health Organization (WHO) and other leading health organizations across the world advised on emergency containment and control measures. Control on a global scale allowed stakeholders from every sector to work toward mitigation measures more efficiently. Slowing down the spread and thus containment of the virus has also allowed scientists to work on many treatment options for COVID-19. Although the current option to treat COVID-19 patients is to alleviate symptoms and avoid co-infection with bacteria through medications, trials on different drug and vaccine candidates are underway (
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">Thanh Le et al., 2020</xref>). However, the safety concerns regarding repurposed drugs and the fact that vaccines, when available, will only prevent infection, calls for additional avenues of drugs to treat patients. Plants provide one such avenue through the products of their secondary metabolism, i.e., phytochemicals. But these too are limited by safety concerns, seasonal and geographic dependence, and lesser uniformity in the metabolite profile of medicinal plants across the globe. The solution to these barriers in harnessing secondary metabolism running in plant cell factories is provided by plant biotechnology. Plant biotechnology is a very promising platform for providing uniform, safe to use, high-yield drugs against coronaviruses. This review article highlights the important potential role of plant cell factories to produce safe and high-yield medicinal compounds against COVID-19. The paper reviews the important biotechnological strategies that can be employed to make the best use of plants for providing secondary metabolites as candidates during anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug discovery.
