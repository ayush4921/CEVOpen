<p>However, plants face the threat of over-harvesting and thus endangerment when collected rigorously. Similarly, due to insufficient data on safety-related aspects of the use of phytomedicine, concerns are still there. There is an incorrect perception that herbal drugs are fully safe and free from any side effects. There are hundreds of toxic constituents in different plants. For this purpose, detailed insight into the pathways and products of the plantâ€™s secondary metabolism is important for drugs that are safe to use (
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">Nature, 2020</xref>). Equally important is the fact that plants located in different regions of the world have different metabolite profiles and are highly dependent on geography and seasons. Plant biotechnology has the potential to overcome these barriers (

 <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures as an important pillar of plant biotechnology provides an option for making the best use of plant machinery to produce medicinally important secondary metabolites (

 <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures lies in the reason that these cultures can be manipulated to trigger their defense response through activating their secondary metabolism. These triggers include elicitation by biotic and abiotic stresses given

 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">Ramirez-Estrada et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, metabolic engineering backed by genetic manipulation tools has been a very viable biotechnology method to obtain novel metabolites and enhance the yield of the existing metabolites of interest (
