<p>Micropropagation is a robust and reliable technique used for the multiplication of plants through 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures; it produces many homogeneous plants in a short period. Besides, the production of bioactive secondary metabolites can be enhanced in medicinal plants with this technique (
