<p>Generally, the potential of plant cell cultures to produce bioactive secondary metabolites can be enhanced by the induction of cell differentiation. Within the different cell culture approaches, hairy root cultures hold tremendous potential for the biosynthesis of volatile organic compounds besides other classes of potent secondary metabolites. When plant tissue is genetically transformed by 
 <italic>Agrobacterium rhizogenes</italic> which inserts its T-DNA through the Ri plasmid, it results in the formation of hair-like small and fine roots. The advantage of hairy root culture technology is that it does not require further media supplementation with plant growth regulators because the inserted T-DNA carries the genes responsible for the endogenous biosynthesis of auxins. Lacking the property of geotropism, hairy roots are highly branched and can grow faster than normal roots. They not only produce the metabolites at levels like the normal roots but also generate metabolites that are produced in the aerial parts of the natural plants. Furthermore, hairy roots are physiologically and biochemically stable like any other cell culture technology (

 <italic>Isatis tinctoria</italic> (

 <italic>Isatis tinctoria</italic> (A.K.A. 
 <italic>Isatis indigotica</italic>) has been shown to possess potential against SARS-CoV through its root-derived phytochemicals (
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2005</xref>). Among the different plants, the hairy roots of 
 <italic>Pimpinella anisum</italic> and 
 <italic>Achillea millefolium</italic> resulted in the production of medicinally important essential oils (
 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">Santos et al., 1998</xref>). In certain cases, such as the hairy roots of 
 <italic>Daucus carota</italic> and 
 <italic>Laburnum alpinum</italic>, the essential oil profiles of the volatiles were found in elevated levels, compared with the respective callus and cell cultures. Further, the metabolic pathways for the biosynthesis of volatiles can be manipulated by using more effective transgenes that can be inserted into the T-DNA region.
