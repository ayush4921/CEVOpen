<p>Few reports are available on the genetic engineering of different plant species through a transformation with the candidate genes responsible for medicinal metabolites biosynthesis. Particularly, the metabolic pathways responsible for producing antiviral metabolites. In these studies, the cauliflower mosaic virus 
 <italic>promoter</italic> (
 <italic>CaMV 35S</italic>) was used for the overexpression of the reductoisomerase DXR of the mevalonate MEP pathway in peppermint, and a significantly higher (50%) increase in total essential oil production was observed. The yields of cyclic monoterpenes were enhanced by the overexpression of the limonene synthase enzyme in the plastid. The overexpression of the rate-limiting factors significantly enhanced the specific yield of monoterpenes (

 <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures through a genetic transformation in plants can boost the production of the desired compounds (

For instance, the production of monoterpene alcohols can be accelerated by the overexpression of linalool synthase, the enzyme responsible for the profound production of glycosylated forms than the free form. Likewise, overexpression of prenyltransferase has been found to increase the yields of the linear as well as some cyclic sesquiterpenes (
