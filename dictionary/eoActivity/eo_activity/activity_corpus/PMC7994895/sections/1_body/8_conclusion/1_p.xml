<p>Plant biotechnology is a promising platform for exploring the unlimited potential of many diverse medicinal plants. Unfortunately, pandemics like COVID-19 are likely to occur again on a smaller or larger scale due to the array of known and unknown pathogens out there. Plant biotechnology tools and methods such as 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> culture technology is an asset at our disposal to harness the diversity of secondary metabolites produced by different plants. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> culture technologies can potentially grow any plant anywhere and offer the added value of overproduction of plant cultures, enhanced production of secondary metabolites, and the generation of novel medicinal compounds.
