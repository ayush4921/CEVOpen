<p>The efficiency of various EOs has been reported in the control and inhibition of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> in meat and poultry products; however, it seems that the interaction of EOs with various food constituents might decrease their antimicrobial properties (

 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>). The interaction of the phenolic compounds of EO with proteins and surrounding EO hydrophobic constituents with fat seem to limit their availability to microorganisms' target size, and therefore, their antimicrobial properties decrease (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Furthermore, it has been indicated that antimicrobial activities of EOs increase by reduction of oxygen level and pH. The hydrophobicity of EOs would increase by a decrease in pH, making it easy for them to dissolve the cell membrane and interact with target sites of the microorganism (

 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>). High concentration of EOs is required for acceptable antimicrobial activity. Consequently, due to the intense aroma of EOs, their application in higher amounts could result in sensory defects (
