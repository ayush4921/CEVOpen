<p>Additionally, Cui et al. studied the synergetic antimicrobial effects of cold nitrogen plasma and lemongrass oil against 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> on pork loin. They found that antibacterial activities of lemongrass oil against 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> was obtained at high doses, while with exertion of cold nitrogen plasma, a lower concentration of lemongrass oil is required to achieve acceptable antimicrobial effects. Therefore, the possible adverse sensory effect of high concentrations of EO can be mitigated after synergic treatment (

 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> in meat and meat products, and further reduction of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> occurred when EOs are associated with these preservative methods (
