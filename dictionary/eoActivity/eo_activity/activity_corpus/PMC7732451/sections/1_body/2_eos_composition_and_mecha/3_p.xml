<p>Apart from the fact that EOs are mainly used as flavoring agents in the food industry, due to their antimicrobial properties, they can also be used in foodstuff to increase shelf life. The main drawback for the application of EOs as antimicrobial agents is the creation of strong aromas and off-flavors, limiting the use of high concentrations (
