<p>Generally, the interaction of EOs with cell membranes of bacteria can be effective in preventing bacterial growth. The hydrophilic or lipophilic properties of EO constituents, type of microorganism, and structure of the cell wall are the factors that affect the antimicrobial activity of EOs (

 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). Furthermore, the shape of the bacteria can be effective in EO activity, and it has been indicated that rod-shaped cells are more sensitive to EOs in comparison with coccoid-shaped cells (
