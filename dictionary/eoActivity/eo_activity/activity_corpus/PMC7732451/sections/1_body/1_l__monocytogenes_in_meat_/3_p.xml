 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> is a psychrotrophic bacterium and can grow over a wide range of temperatures (1–45°C) and pHs (4.3–9.4) and at water activity with a value of 0.92 and above (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). In comparison to other foodborne pathogens, 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> can tolerate undesirable environmental conditions such as low-oxygen conditions, nitrite, and high salt content. Furthermore, it can persist in the environment, processing plants, and food products at refrigerated temperatures for a long time (

 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). The ability of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> in forming biofilms allows it to remain successfully in food processing establishments and retails (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Due to the formation of biofilms and attachment of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> to various surfaces in food establishments, it is hard to eradicate this pathogen without the performance of precise sanitary protocols. Indeed, because biocides are often highly chemically reactive molecules, the presence of various organic compounds such as polysaccharides, nucleic acids, and proteins can remarkably weaken their efficiency. Furthermore, possible interactions between antimicrobials and biofilm components might explain the limitations of penetration into the biofilm (
