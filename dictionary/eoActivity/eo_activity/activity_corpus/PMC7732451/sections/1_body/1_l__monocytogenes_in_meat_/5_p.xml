<p>Since many listeriosis outbreaks have been linked to meat product consumption, prevention of meat and meat product contamination with 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> is one of the major concerns of the meat processing industry (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Thermal processing of meat products can easily eliminate 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>. However, posterior contamination of meat products especially RTE meat products with this pathogen is frequent. Various post-package decontamination strategies such as in-package thermal pasteurization, irradiation, high-pressure processing, and use of antimicrobial additives in the formulation of meat products have been utilized to mitigate and control the growth of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> in meat and poultry products (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Various food-grade synthetic preservatives and antimicrobial agents have been utilized to prevent the growth of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>; however, due to increasing awareness of consumers about the potential adverse effects of synthetic preservatives, more researches have been developed to determine the potential use of natural additives and antimicrobial compounds in the food industry. Among these, there has been great attention in using EOs as natural antimicrobials and antioxidants in the formulation of meat and poultry products.
