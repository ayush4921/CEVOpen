<p>Additionally, in a study carried out by Raeisi et al., the effects of sodium alginate coating with nisin, cinnamon, and rosemary EOs individually and in combinations on the fate of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> in chicken meat during 15 days of refrigeration were studied. The control and the sample coated with alginate solution had the highest growth rate of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, while other treated samples, especially those with the combined use of tested antimicrobial agents, resulted in the inhibition of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, whereas the combination of cinnamon and rosemary EOs, rosemary EOs and nisin, and cinnamon EOs and nisin had the lowest final population, respectively, indicating the synergistic effect of these EOs and nisin in controlling 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> (

It seems that cinnamaldehyde and camphor as the main components of cinnamon and rosemary EOs contribute to their antibacterial activities by disrupting the function of the cytoplasmic membrane, electron flow, proton motive force, and coagulation of cell contents (

 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> was more inhibited by the simultaneous use of 
 <italic>Zataria multiflora</italic> EO and grape seed extract in comparison with individual use of 
 <italic>Z. multiflora</italic> EO in buffalo patties (
