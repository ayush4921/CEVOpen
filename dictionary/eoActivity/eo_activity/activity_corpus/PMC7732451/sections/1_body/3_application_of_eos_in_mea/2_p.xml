<p>Upadhyay et al. studied the effect of GRAS plant-derived antimicrobial compounds against 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> in frankfurters by applying them as post-processing dip treatments. The surface of frankfurters was inoculated with a mixture of five strains of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> (~6.0 log CFU per frankfurter) and treated at 55°C (60 s) and 65°C (30 s) in in sterile deionized water or water with as β-resorcylic acid (1.5%), carvacrol (0.75%), and 
 <italic>trans</italic>-cinnamaldehyde (0.75%) alone. After that, the samples were vacuum-packaged (VP) and kept at 4°C for 70 days. They found that the application of plant-derived compounds as antimicrobial dips was effective in preventing growth of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> on frankfurters during refrigerated storage. They also found that β-resorcylic acid had the highest activity against 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> in comparison to other individual antimicrobial treatments. They concluded that plant-derived antimicrobial compounds could be efficiently utilized as post-processing dips to decrease 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> on frankfurters (

 <italic>Thymus capitata</italic> EO against 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> ATCC 19118 inoculated in minced beef meat were investigated by El Abed et al. They also investigated anti-
 <italic>Listeria</italic> activity of various concentrations [0.01, 0.05, 0.25, and 1.25% (v/w)] of 
 <italic>T. capitata</italic> EO in minced beef meat and found that by increasing EO concentration, a gradual decrease in 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> ATCC 19118 count occurred. They figured out that the 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> population was significantly decreased by the application of 0.25 or 1.25% (v/w) of 
 <italic>T. capitata</italic> EO to minced beef in comparison to control samples (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Moon et al. studied the synergism effect of soy sauce and teriyaki sauce with carvacrol or thymol (0.3 and 0.5%) as common natural compounds in controlling 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> in marinated beef stored at 4°C for 7 days. They figured out that 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> was not inhibited by usage of Teriyaki sauce alone, while teriyaki sauce in combination with 0.5% carvacrol or thymol inactivated 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> during 7 days of storage (
