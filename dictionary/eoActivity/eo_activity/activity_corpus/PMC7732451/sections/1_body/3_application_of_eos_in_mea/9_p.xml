<p>Awaisheh et al. studied the anti-
 <italic>Listeria</italic> activity of fir or qysoom EOs alone (1% v/w) or in combination (0.5% each) in beef-luncheon meat products inoculated with 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> and stored at 4°C for 14 days. They figured out that at the end of storage, for samples with low contamination (3 log CFU/g), fir EO, qysoom EO, and their mixture had ~6.37, 6.04, and 5.53 log CFU/g of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, respectively, compared to 6.90 log CFU/g of the control, while in the samples with a high contamination level (6 log CFU/g), bacterial counts reached 8.43, 8.88, and 6.75 log CFU/g for fir EO, and qysoom EO, and their mixture, respectively, compared to 9.90 log CFU/g of the control. They indicated that the combination of fir and qysoom exerts good anti-
 <italic>Listeria</italic> activity. It has been reported that α -and β-pinene, 1,8-cineol, and borneol that are present in fir and qysoom participate in the antimicrobial activities of these EOs (
