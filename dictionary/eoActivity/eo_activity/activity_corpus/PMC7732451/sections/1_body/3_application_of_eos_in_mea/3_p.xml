<p>Giarratana et al. studied the effect of thyme and rosemary EOs (0.025 and 0.05%) against a mix of three strains of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> (
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> ATCC 19111, ATCC 13932, and ATCC 19117) in Italian mortadella packaged in a modified atmosphere and kept at 4°C for 30 days. Their results revealed that the mixture of rosemary and thyme EOs had a bacteriostatic activity against 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> and that both 0.025 and 0.05% of tested EOs significantly inhibited 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> growth compared with the control sample. The 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> population increased from approximately 2.50 log CFU/g to 5.31, 3.01, and 2.52 log CFU/g in control, 0.025% EO-treated, and 0.05% EO-treated samples, respectively. They indicated that heat treatment of mortadella at 80°C for 4 h could change the antimicrobial activity of tested EOs. Therefore, complementary preservation strategies such as modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) can improve the EO antimicrobial effect. They also studied the effect of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) growth and pH changes of mortadella on antimicrobial activity of tested EOs and understood that with the growth of LAB and decrease of pH values in mortadella, bacteriostatic activity of tested EOs against as 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> increased (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). It has been indicated that the pH of the food matrix affects the activity of EOs and that the hydrophobicity of some EOs increased at low pH. Therefore, EOs can more easily penetrate the lipid part of the bacterial membrane and hence exert increased antimicrobial activities (

 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>). Similarly, Gouveia et al. evaluated the antimicrobial effect of rosemary (
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> L.) and thyme (
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> L.) against 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> ATCC 679 in sous vide cook–chill beef at 2 and 8°C during 28 days of storage. Their results showed that thyme and rosemary EOs at 3.9 and 62.5 μl/ml could inhibit 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>. They also studied the effect of EOs at MIC values on the inhibition of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> in beef samples. The sample containing thyme EOs and the control sample had similar counts of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>. On the other hand, a 2-log CFU/g reduction occurred in the rosemary-treated samples stored at 2 and 8°C. They concluded that rosemary EO can be potentially used as a natural preservative. They indicated that the lower antimicrobial effect of thyme EOs could be attributed to the low concentrations of thymol (phenolic compound) in the 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> chemotype that was utilized in their investigation (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>). Conversely, a higher antimicrobial activity of thyme EO against 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> in minced meat stored at 4°C was reported by Pesavento et al. They stated that 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (47.9%) and thymol (43.1%) were the main antimicrobial constituents (
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>). In contrast, in the study carried out by Gouveia et al., the reduced antimicrobial activity of tested thymol EOs was associated with lower levels of 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (4.91%) and thymol (7.48%). They also indicated that the decreased antimicrobial activity of thymol EO can be associated with the lower concentrations used (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>). It is stated that 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene can be placed on the bacterial membrane and interfere with its function. Furthermore, the thymol compound, which is a phenolic monoterpenoid, has a phenolic ring and can cause functional and structural damage to the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane (
