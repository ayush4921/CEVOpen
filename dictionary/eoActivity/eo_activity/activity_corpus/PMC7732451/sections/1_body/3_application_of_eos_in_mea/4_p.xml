<p>In a study by Mytle et al., the antimicrobial activity of clove (
 <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic>) EOs (1 and 2%, v/w) on RTE chicken frankfurters, which were inoculated with seven strains of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> (10
 <sup>2</sup>-10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/g) and stored for 14 days (at 5 or 15°C), was determined. They found that all the tested strains were able to survive and grow in the control sample at 5 and 15°C, while the addition of either 1 or 2% clove EO inhibited bacterial growth under both storage conditions. They indicated that clove EO (1% v/w) along with low-temperature storage could decrease possible contamination and growth of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> without having an adverse effect on flavor (

 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> in ground beef. They studied the effect of 5 and 10% of crude and commercial clove EO or 2.5 and 5.0% of crude and commercial cinnamon EO against 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> in ground beef stored at 0 and 8°C for 7 days and at −18°C for 60 days. They realized that 10% of either crude or commercial clove EOs were able to entirely inhibit 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> in ground beef 3 days post inoculation, regardless of storage temperature, while either crude or commercial clove EOs at 5% concentration was not able to effectively inactivate 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> during storage. Furthermore, both 2.5 and 5.0% cinnamon EOs were not able to kill 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> during storage. On the other hand, based on the storage time and temperature, a decrease of 3.5–4.0 log CFU/g in the 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> population occurred with the addition of 5.0% commercial cinnamon EOs. This bacterial count reduction was achieved after 7 days of refrigeration and chilling temperatures and 60 days of freezing temperatures, indicating that anti-
 <italic>Listeria</italic> activity of cinnamon EO is affected by time and temperature. However anti-
 <italic>Listeria</italic> activity of clove EO was not affected by time and temperature, and therefore, clove EO can be more effective in the inactivation of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> in ground beef than cinnamon (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Similarly, it has been reported by various investigations that clove and cinnamon EOs could be effective in the inhibition of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> and in expanding the shelf life of meat (

 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>). The antibacterial effect of clove is related to eugenol, a member of the phenylpropanoid class of compounds that cause the deterioration of the cell wall and lysis of bacterial cell (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>). Furthermore, the antibacterial activity of cinnamon EOs is derived from compounds such as cinnamaldehyde, limonene, and eugenol (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). It was stated that eugenol could change the membrane and fatty acid profile, affect the transportation of ATP and ion, and inhibit ATPase, histidine decarboxylase, amylase, and protease enzymes (
