<p>Absence of pyrrolizidine alkaloids in the essential oils is in accordance with the zero mortality rate observed, and the lack of behavioral changes, in the albino Swiss Webster mice in the acute toxicity trial, as well as with the lack of any adverse reaction following contact with human skin, as demonstrated with the skin irritation assay. The observed toxicity in 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> flies is therefore related to the presence of various terpene and terpene-like compounds. Plants produce many terpenes as a natural defense against insects [

 <italic>P. hybridus</italic> subsp. ochroleucus leaf, which was four times more toxic to 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> than the rhizome essential oil was, contained high concentrations of linalool (9.03%) (

 <italic>P. hybridus</italic> subsp. ochroleucus can be considered as an efficient insect repellent.
