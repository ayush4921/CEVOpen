<p>The anti-inflammatory activity results are presented in 
 <xref rid="plants-09-00700-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. Essential oil from the rhizome significantly decreased edema thickness at the concentrations of 10% (at 1, 4 and 6 h) and 20% (at 4 and 6 h), and the anti-inflammatory activity increased similarly to the referent indomethacin group. Essential oil from leaves decreased edema thickness only at the concentration of 40%, with high efficiency throughout the examined duration and a high percent of anti-inflammatory activity, similar to the indomethacin group. Lower concentrations of the essential oil from the leaves did not show significant results.
