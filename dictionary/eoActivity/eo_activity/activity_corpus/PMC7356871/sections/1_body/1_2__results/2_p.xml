<p>Essential oils from both leaves and the rhizomes of 
 <italic>P. hybridus</italic> subsp. ochroleucus demonstrated antioxidant activity (
 <xref rid="plants-09-00700-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), with the activity of the leavesâ€™ essential oils greater than that of the rhizomes. Neither of the two essential oils expressed antimicrobial activity against any of the tested bacterial strains (20 pathogenic bacterial strains, e.g., 10 laboratory reference strains and 10 strains isolated from human wound swabs), and certain bacterial strains even appeared to grow better in the presence of the essential oils (although not statistically significant; data not shown). External (topical) application of the essential oils did not cause skin irritation in any of the participating human volunteers, and all of the experimental Albino Swiss Webster mice survived the acute toxicity trial.
