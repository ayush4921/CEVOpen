<p>Results obtained from the screening of the interaction of the essential oils with cholinesterase from pooled human serum are presented in 
 <xref rid="plants-09-00700-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Essential oils from the leaves and rhizomes of 
 <italic>P. hybridus</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>ochroleucus</italic> inhibited cholinesterase activity, but to a lesser extent then Neositgmin bromide, a synthetic cholinesterase inhibitor. The inhibition by the leavesâ€™ essential oil (33.24%) was lower than the inhibition by the essential oil from the rhizomes (26.37%).
