<p>To the best of our knowledge, the chemical composition of the essential oil of 
 <italic>P. hybridus</italic>, subsp. ochroleucus has not been studied before, and only limited information is available regarding its biological activities, despite the common use of the plant by the people of the Balkans. Variability in chemical composition within and between 
 <italic>P. hybridus</italic> species is known to occur [
 <xref rid="B11-plants-09-00700" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-plants-09-00700" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. We therefore analyzed the chemical profile of the essential oils, as well as their effect on a range of biological and toxicological activities. Chemical composition may also vary between plant organs, and we have therefore comparatively evaluated the composition and activities of essential oils from leaves and rhizomes.
