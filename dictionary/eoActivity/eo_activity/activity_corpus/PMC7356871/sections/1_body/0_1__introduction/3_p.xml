<p>The present study focused on 
 <italic>Petasites hybridus</italic> subsp. ochroleucus, (i.e., a subspecies of 
 <italic>Petasites hybridus</italic>) which is spread and used in traditional medicine mainly in the eastern, central and southern parts of the Balkans [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-09-00700" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-plants-09-00700" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and is endemic to the southern Balkan region. Very little information is available on this sub-species, which is distinguished from the more common and widely distributed, red-flowered subspecies 
 <italic>P. hybridus</italic> subsp. hybridus, which is common in the northern and western parts of the Balkans, as well as in the rest of Europe. We focused on the essential oil of this plant, which is a herbal preparation not commonly used in traditional practices of 
 <italic>Petasites hybridus</italic> and therefore has attracted little research-attention so far, but that has a potential for safe use since the toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids are non-volatiles and are therefore usually not present in essential oils.
