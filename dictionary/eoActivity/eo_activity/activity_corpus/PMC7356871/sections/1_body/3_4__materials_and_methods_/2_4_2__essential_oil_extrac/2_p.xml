<p>Comparison of Kovats retention indices [applying calibrated automated mass spectral deconvolution and identification system software (AMDIS ver. 2.64)], in combination with the SIA resolution method [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-09-00700" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], was used for detection of the compounds. Spectral data were compared with the available literature [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-09-00700" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], while obtained mass spectra were compared to those from Wiley 275 and NIST/NBS libraries using various search engines. The retention indices were obtained by co-injection with a standard aliphatic hydrocarbons C7â€“C40 mixture.
