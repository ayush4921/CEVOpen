<p>The essential oil was extracted from fresh rhizomes and leaves by hydrodistillation for 4 h using a Clevenger-type apparatus. The extracted oil was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and stored at 4 °C until further use. Chemical profile of the essential oils was obtained by GC and GC-MS analyses. The GC analysis was performed on a GC HP-5890 II apparatus, equipped with a split–splitless injector, an HP-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm film thickness) using helium as the carrier gas (1 mL/min), and a flame ionization detector. Operating conditions were as previously reported [
