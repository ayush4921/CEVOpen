<p>Risk Assessment Tool Analysis Software RA V1.0 was used to predict the short term LC50 (the lethal concentration required to kill 50% of the experimental population at a given time) by using surface response model analysis of the results for the 
 <italic>P. hybridus</italic> rhizome and leaf extracts after subchronic exposure. Furthermore, the chronic toxicity threshold (LC1) was derived for the 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (larva to adult). Development time (larva to pupa; larva to adult) was calculated for each replica of 20 eggs (N = 3) according to the following equation: DT = ∑n
 <sub>d</sub>*d/n
 <sub>t</sub>, where n
 <sub>d</sub> is the number of pupating larvae/emerging flies d days after the eggs were laid, and n
 <sub>t</sub> is the total number of individuals pupating/emerging at the end of experiment. Results were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test and Dunnett’s procedure if significant. In addition, frequency analysis was performed by pooling together three replicas (total N = 60 per concentration) and results were expressed as categorical data (1—pass, or 0—fail). A chi-square test was conducted to assess significant differences in the relative mortality or pupation frequencies. If significant, after residual analysis, Fischer’s exact test was used to compare specific 2 × 2 tables and assess differences in the relative frequencies. Only a 
 <italic>p</italic> value of ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
