<p>In this study, a detailed comparative study regarding the chemical composition and anti-infective properties of 
 <italic>C. morifolium</italic> and 
 <italic>C. indicum</italic> essential oils was presented. The biological activities of the essential oils against a wide range of microbes and viruses were investigated. Moreover, microorganisms of food and clinical interest have been selected as target for the antimicrobial evaluation to further consolidate the rationale beyond the traditional use of both plants for the first time as anti-infective agents aiming to use these plants and their oils as natural spices and preservatives both in food and pharmaceutical preparations.
