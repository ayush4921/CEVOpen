<p>The ability of the 
 <italic>C. indicum</italic> and 
 <italic>C. morifolium</italic> oil to scavenge superoxide anion radicals was evaluated according to the previously reported method [
 <xref rid="B40-foods-09-01460" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In brief, several concentrations of oils and quercetin (used as a positive control) were added to SO generated solution (1 mL of Tris–HCL buffer (16 mM, pH-8), 1 mL of nitroblue tetrazolium NBT (50 µM), 1 mL of Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) (78 µM) solution and 1 mL of PMS (phenazine methosulfate) (10 µM). Incubation was done for 5 min at 25 °C and then the absorbance was measured at 560 nm in spectrophotometer. The percentage inhibition of O

 <sup>•-</sup> generation was calculated as follows:
 <disp-formula>% Inhibition = [Ac − As/Ac] × 100,</disp-formula> where Ac: absorbance of control; As: absorbance of sample.
