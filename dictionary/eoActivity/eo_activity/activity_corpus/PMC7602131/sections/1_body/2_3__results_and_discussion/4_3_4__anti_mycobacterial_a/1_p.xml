<p>Additionally, both oils showed a substantial anti-mycobacterial activity against

 <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> potential of the essential oils is mainly attributed to the presence of terpenes and fatty acids that account for the lipophilicity and greater penetration through the cell membrane triggering a massive disturbance in the oxidative phosphorylation and the electron transport chain as well resulting in a serious interference in the production of energy with concomitant evolution of auto-oxidation and peroxidation degradation compounds and bacterial lysis [
