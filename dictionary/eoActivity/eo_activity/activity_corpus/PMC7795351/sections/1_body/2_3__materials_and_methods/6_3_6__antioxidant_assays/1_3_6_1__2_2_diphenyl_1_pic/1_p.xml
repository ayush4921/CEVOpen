<p>The DPPH free radical scavenging activity was estimated by assay based on the method described in the literature [
 <xref rid="B56-molecules-26-00131" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Briefly, 2.0 mL of 0.5 mmol/L DPPH in ethanol was mixed with 100 μL of essential oil of 
 <italic>A. polystachya</italic> (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 mg/mL). After 20 min incubation, the absorbance was measured at 517 nm. Trolox and gallic acid were used as positive controls. The percentage of free radical-scavenging capacity was calculated by Equation (2):
 <disp-formula>RSC% = 100% × (A
  <sub>control</sub> − A
  <sub>sample</sub>)/A
  <sub>control</sub>
  <label>(2)</label>
 </disp-formula> where A
 <sub>sample</sub> is the absorbance of DPPH mixed with essential oil and A
 <sub>control</sub> is the absorbance of DPPH in which sample has been replaced with ethanol. All measurements were performed in triplicate and reported as the average value. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> value was determined by linear regression analysis from the obtained radical scavenging capacity (RSC) values.
