<p>In this study, we used three different tumor cell lines: human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), human prostate adenocarcinoma (PC-3), and human colorectal adenocarcinoma (HT-29). A normal human cell line (colon epithelials, CCD 841 CoN) was included to evaluate the possible selective activity of the essential oil. The different cell lines were maintained as monolayers in a plastic culture medium (HAM-F10+DMEM, 1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, as well as antibiotics (0.01 mg/mL streptomycin and 0.005 mg/mL penicillin). The cells were incubated at 37 Â°C in a humidified 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere.
