<p>FRAP assay was carried out using the above method [
 <xref rid="B58-molecules-26-00131" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. FRAP test solution was prepared using FeCl
 <sub>3</sub>·6H
 <sub>2</sub>O in distilled water (final concentration of Fe(III) in the solution was 20 mM), 2,4,6-tri(2-pyridyl)-s-triazine (TPTZ) in 40 mM HCl (final concentration of TPTZ was 10 mM), and 0.3 M CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH/CH
 <sub>3</sub>COONa buffer solution at pH = 3.6. The FRAP reagent was prepared daily as follows: acetic acid buffer, TPTZ solution, and FRAP test solution were mixed in this order at the volume ratio of 10:1:1. A 3.0 mL aliquot of FRAP reagent was mixed with 300 μL of deionized water and 100 µL of methanolic essential oil solution (1.0 mg/mL). The mixture was vigorously shaken for 30 s and left in the dark at 37 °C for 30 min. Subsequently the absorbance was measured at 593 nm using ethanol as the blank solution. The obtained absorbance values were interpolated in a Trolox calibrate curve (0–200 mg/L) and the FRAP values were expressed in mM Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (mM TEAC). BHT and gallic acid were used as positive controls. All of the measurements were performed in triplicate.
