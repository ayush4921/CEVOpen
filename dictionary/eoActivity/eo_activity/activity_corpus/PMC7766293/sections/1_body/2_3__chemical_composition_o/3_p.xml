 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oil, in some cases after hydrodistillation, the decoction water (the remaining hydrodistillation aqueous phase) was also collected [

The extracts obtained from the aerial parts of the plant were characterized by the presence of different polyphenol classes, in particular, flavonoids (apigenin, kaempferol, luteolin, naringenin, quercetin, sakuranetin, sterubin), phenolic acids (caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, 2-methoxysalicylic acid, 3-methoxysalicylic acid, rosmarinic acid, salvianolic acids I and K and derivatives), phenolic terpene (carnosol) and hexoside and glycoside derivatives; other compounds identified were steroid (Î²-sitosterol), triterpenoids (oleanolic acid, ursolic acid), and xanthophyll lutein [

 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oil, in which the composition is extensively characterized, the extract phenolic profile has been less investigated and diverse chromatographic peaks detected during the phytochemical characterization remain unidentified.
