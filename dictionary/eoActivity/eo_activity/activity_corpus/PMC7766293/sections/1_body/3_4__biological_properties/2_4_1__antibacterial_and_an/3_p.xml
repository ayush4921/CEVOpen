 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oils with origin in different bioclimatic zones from Murcia (Spain) showed activity (growth inhibition) against Gram-positive (methicillin-sensitive 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>), Gram-negative (
 <italic>E. coli</italic>), and fungi (
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>). However, some differences were identified among them, probably due to the influence of the clime in the composition of the essential oil. In particular, 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oil from the Supra-Mediterranean bioclimatic zone (Moratalla, Spain) produced higher inhibition against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> than the 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oils from other bioclimatic zones (Caravaca de la Cruz and Lorca, Spain) due to the high concentration of linalool [

 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oil than those found in this study [
 <xref rid="B29-pharmaceuticals-13-00479" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B45-pharmaceuticals-13-00479" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Recently Arantes et al. [
 <xref rid="B2-pharmaceuticals-13-00479" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] described the 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oil broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against several strains. It was observed higher susceptibility (lower MICs) observed in Gram-negative bacteria (
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Morganella morganii</italic>, 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic>, 
 <italic>Salmonella enteritidis</italic>, 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>, and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>) than in Gram-positive ones (methicillin-sensitive 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic>) for both agar disc diffusion assay and MICs determination by broth microdilution assay. The higher antibacterial activity against Gram-negative is suggested to be correlated with the presence of monoterpene and phenolic compounds capable of disintegrating the outer membrane of Gram-negative strains. In fact, essential oils are characterized by unique antibacterial potential due to the high number of chemical compounds present in their composition, which act simultaneously, preventing resistance mechanisms in bacteria. Furthermore, synergistic interactions between compounds of essential oils can potentiate their natural antimicrobial effect. Thus, antimicrobial potential cannot be associated with only one component or mechanism of action. Nevertheless, due to the lipophilic character of essential oils, the mechanism of action could be related to the alteration of cell membrane properties.
