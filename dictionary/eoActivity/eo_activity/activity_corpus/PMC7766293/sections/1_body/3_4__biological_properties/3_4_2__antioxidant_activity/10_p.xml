<p>Chitosan edible films incorporated with 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oil (concentrations of 1% and 2%) were tested by DPPH and FRAP methods. The DPPH method demonstrated lower values (0.29 and 0.44 mg/g, respectively) compared to the FRAP method (2.21 and 3.99 mg/g, respectively) [

 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oil for DPPH methods, 2,2â€²-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical cation scavenging activity assay, and FRAP assay, while the concentrations used ranged from 0.15 to 20 mg/mL of 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oil for the ferrous ion-chelating ability assay. The DPPH method showed the lowest IC
 <sub>50</sub> values (3.11 mg/mL), followed by the ABTS radical scavenging method (3.73 mg/mL), followed by the ferrous ion-chelating activity (9.61 mg/mL). Relative to the FRAP assay, the results were 19.26 mg TE/mL. 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oil can be used in general by the food and pharmaceutical industry as a potential natural additive, replacing or reducing the use of chemical substances, since it has antioxidant properties [
