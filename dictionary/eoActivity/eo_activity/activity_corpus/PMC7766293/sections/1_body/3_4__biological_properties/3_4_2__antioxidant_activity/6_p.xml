<p>Albano et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-pharmaceuticals-13-00479" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], evaluated the antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oil and decoction water extract. The DPPH method was used with the essential oil and decoction water extract, while the scavenging activity of the superoxide anion radical was only used successfully with decoction water extract. For the DPPH method, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> of the essential oil was much higher (6706.8 μg/mL) than that of the extract (4.2 μg/mL). The evaluation of the antioxidant activity by the superoxide anion scavenging activity method in the extract revealed that the IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> was 14.8 μg/mL. In this study, no correlation was detected between total phenols and removal of superoxide anion radicals.
