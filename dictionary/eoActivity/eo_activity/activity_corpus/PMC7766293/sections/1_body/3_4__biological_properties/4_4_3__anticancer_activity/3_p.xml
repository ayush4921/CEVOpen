<p>The antiproliferative effect of 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oil against human breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-231 was also evaluated, showing an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 108.5 Î¼g/mL. From the literature, studies reported that antiproliferative activity could be related to 1,8-cineole content and are dependent on the monoterpenes content and their ability to affect oxidative stress [

It has been appointed that the preventive effect of essential oils on cancer disorders could be related to the promotion of cell cycle arrest, stimulating cell apoptosis and DNA repair mechanisms, inhibiting cancer cell proliferation, metastasis formation, and multidrug resistance, which makes them potential candidates for adjuvant anticancer therapeutic agents.
