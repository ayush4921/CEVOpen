<p>Albano et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-pharmaceuticals-13-00479" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] reported the AChE inhibition activity of 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oil for the first time, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 45.8 Î¼g/mL related to the 1,8-cineole constituent. However, the assessment of decoction water extracts was not possible for AChE inhibition capacity. Aazza et al. [
 <xref rid="B40-pharmaceuticals-13-00479" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] also reported AChE inhibition activity of 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oil but poor activity was observed (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.1 mg/mL), despite the fact that the main constituent was also 1,8-cineole.
