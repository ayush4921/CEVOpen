<p>The authors prepared antimicrobial polymer films based on polypropylene modified by caraway essential oil derived from 
 <italic>Carum carvi</italic> L. seeds, which was immobilized on the carrier of talc, according to a thermoplastic process. The resultant films were compression moulded to an approximate thickness of 200 Âµm, which possessed a typical light grey-green hue and had the aroma of caraway. The effect of incorporating the caraway essential oil in the composites on the properties of the films were examined by morphological study, tensile testing, thermal analysis (TGA and DSC), gas chromatography, and antimicrobial evaluation.
