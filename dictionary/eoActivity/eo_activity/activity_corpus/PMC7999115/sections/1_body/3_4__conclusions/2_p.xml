<p>Scanning electron microscopy of the cryo-fractured surfaces of the composites with the talc filler showed even distribution in the form of non-aggregated inclusions in the plate-type shapes, which disturbed the continuous structure of the neat polypropylene matrix. However, in all cases of caraway essential oil addition into the composition, it had no impact on the distribution of talc in polymer matter. Moreover, polypropylene/talc/essential oil composites showed comparable homogeneity in the entire volume of the samples. Tensile testing revealed that adding the essential oil reduced the tensile strength of the films but increased their elongation at break of as a consequence of exerting a plasticizing effect. Modifying the polypropylene with the caraway essential oil immobilized on a solid carrier of talc appropriately improved the thermal stability of the antimicrobial films. It was demonstrated that talc particles have an influence on crystallinity in polypropylene composite; talc already acted as a nucleating agent for polymer matrix. As a consequence, the release kinetics of caraway essential oil can be controlled depending on the input concentration of the volatile substance. The caraway essential oil, comprising carvone and limonene as its major compounds, generated larger zones of inhibition against gram-positive 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> than gram-negative 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. In this context, the prepared films showed antimicrobial activity against the pathogens of gram-positive 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and gram-negative 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> at the concentration of caraway essential oil of 4.9 Â± 0.2 wt% and higher. Therefore, at a time of a global pandemic caused by the COVID-19 virus, materials such as the prepared PP/TC/EO films appear to be suitable for real-world applications that require antimicrobial action, including the packaging of food.
