<p>Antimicrobial blends for the preparation of films were created by the melt compounding technique, whereby commercially available caraway essential oil (EO) into the solid carrier of talc (TC) with polypropylene (PP) was mixed. The EO was added into the solid carrier prior to thermoplastic compounding with the polymer matrix, the purpose being to enhance thermal stability and reduce the diffusion rate for EO from the matrix. The subsequent films, after they had undergone compression moulding, were approximately 200 Âµm thick and light grey-green in shade, as typical for the given filler, with the aroma of caraway.</p>
