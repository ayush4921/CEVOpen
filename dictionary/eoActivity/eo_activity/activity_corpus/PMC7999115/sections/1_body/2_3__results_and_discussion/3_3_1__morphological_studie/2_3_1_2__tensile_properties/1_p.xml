<p>Tensile testing was conducted to determine the effect of the TC and the incorporation of the EO on the mechanical properties of the prepared films. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-00906-f002">Figure 2</xref> details Young’s modulus, tensile strength, and elongation at break of the neat PP and the PP/TC composites containing different amounts of immobilized caraway EO in their structure. The values obtained for tensile strength and elongation at break for neat PP (34.4 ± 2.4 MPa and 118 ± 5%, respectively) were in accordance with the technical data sheet on the polymer and the findings of other authors who have discussed the same type of homopolymer [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-00906-f002">Figure 2</xref> details that the Young’s modulus for PP/TC showed the most significant increase of up to 1634 ± 152 MPa as well as decrease in tensile strength (29.6 ± 1.7 MPa) and elongation (7.1 ± 0.7%). Similar results were reported by Karrad et al. [
 <xref rid="B40-polymers-13-00906" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] in a study on an HDPE/PS/TC system and the effects of TC on mechanical behaviour, wherein modulus values gradually increased in parallel with greater content of talc. Other studies confirm a comparable trend of the growth of modulus and the reduction of elongation values depending on the incorporation of talc into the PP matrix [
