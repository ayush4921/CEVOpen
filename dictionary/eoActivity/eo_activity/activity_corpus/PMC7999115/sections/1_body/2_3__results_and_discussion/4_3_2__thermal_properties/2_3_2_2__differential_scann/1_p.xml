<p>The results given in 
 <xref rid="polymers-13-00906-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> cover melting and crystallization temperatures and enthalpies of the film samples, as determined by differential scanning calorimetry and calculation of the degree of crystallization in per cent. Adding the TC into the PP matrix led neither to a shift in T
 <sub>m</sub> (164.4 and 165.4 Â°C, see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-00906-f004">Figure 4</xref>) nor a change in temperature of T
 <sub>c</sub>, in agreement with research by others [

 <xref rid="B51-polymers-13-00906" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,
 <xref rid="B52-polymers-13-00906" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Nevertheless, TC had an impact on enthalpy, causing a decrease of about 15 J/g (see 
 <xref rid="polymers-13-00906-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The rise in crystallinity indicates TC is a good nucleating agent, since the PP has the potential to undergo transcrystallization on the TC surface. Such a trend was observed in a study by Ammar et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-polymers-13-00906" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], in which TC was incorporated as a reinforcing filler in a PP matrix. Note that slight changes in the T
 <sub>m</sub> for each sample relate to an error in measurement common for this method [
 <xref rid="B53-polymers-13-00906" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. As the EO content increased, the intensity of the melting peak diminished, indicating reduction in enthalpy; moreover, the intensity of the melting peak reduced by decreasing of PP content in the PP/TC/EO composites as well. This revealed that the crystallinity phase receded alongside increase in the content of the caraway EO in composites in comparison with PP/TC, as described in 
 <xref rid="polymers-13-00906-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. While this demonstrated the effect of the EO on the crystallinity of the sample, the differences in T
 <sub>m</sub> for the composite were negligible and thus were dismissed as unimportant; hence, the melting temperature was considered identical to the temperature interval for neat PP. The glass transition temperature (T
 <sub>g</sub>) was not observed at all due to its very low expression in the gathered data; notably, other authors have not given values for T
 <sub>g</sub> either [

 <xref rid="B27-polymers-13-00906" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The crystallinity index (
 <italic>X
  <sub>C</sub>
 </italic>) was affected by the amount of EO and thus acted in dependence on concentration. Immobilizing the EO in the sample caused decline in values for 
 <italic>X
  <sub>C</sub>
 </italic> in confirmation of the plasticizing effect and the TC surface hydrophobicity modification by EO incorporation, in comparison with PP and PP/TC films. The unexpected sharp decline in crystallinity in the sample with the highest EO concentration (20%) could have been due to the loading capacity of the TC as a carrier as per its interaction with the EO. Therefore, the decrease in crystallinity might have arisen through interactions between the polymer matrix and the free volume of the molecules of the caraway EO in the PP macromolecular network. A similar effect has been reported for PP, where carvacrol and thymol were directly added into a polymer matrix [
