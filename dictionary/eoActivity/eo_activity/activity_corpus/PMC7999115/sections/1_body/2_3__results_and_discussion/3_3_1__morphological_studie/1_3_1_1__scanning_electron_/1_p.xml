<p>It is known that a matter of importance regarding particulate composites is the interface between the filler and the matrix in addition to their distribution in, dispersion in, and interfacial adhesion with a polymer matrix [

 <xref rid="B32-polymers-13-00906" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Hence, observation was made herein of the microstructures of the composites by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in order to investigate the morphology of the samples and, especially, the influence of the filler. The SEM micrograph in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-00906-f001">Figure 1</xref>a shows the neat PP sample was homogeneous in structure. The degree of homogeneity and the internal structures of the composites are visible in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-00906-f001">Figure 1</xref>bâ€“f. The filler TC was distributed evenly as non-aggregated inclusions in the plate-type shapes, interrupting the continuity of the structure of the neat PP polymer [

 <xref rid="B33-polymers-13-00906" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The cryo-fractured surface cracks stemmed from the low affinity of the hydrophobic PP matrix and the hydrophilic TC filler, resulting in poor adhesion between the two phases on the interface [

No effect was discerned on the microstructure of the resultant composites through differing the amount of EO supplemented into the TC structure at the given concentrations. This finding is not in accordance with other authors, who report that neat linseed or thyme EO, which had been directly mixed with the polymer matrix, caused a porous surface in films through them evaporating from the structure of the polymer [

 <xref rid="B36-polymers-13-00906" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. As a consequence, the homogeneous structures described herein without such porous surfaces resulted from immobilizing the EO in the carrier, therefore, no free droplets formed in any of the matrices.
