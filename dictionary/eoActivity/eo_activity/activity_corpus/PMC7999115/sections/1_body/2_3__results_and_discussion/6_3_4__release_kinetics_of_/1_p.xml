<p>The release kinetics of the EO derived from 
 <italic>Carum carvi</italic> L. seeds were performed by measurement that discerned the concentration of carvone as a major compound by Pyrolysis-GC/MS as well as calculation of the chromatographic area and further reference of the given numbers to the concentration of the compound in the samples. In order to further elaborate the release mechanism of the EO from the composites, the release profiles were fitted with an orthogonal polynomial fitting model. The coefficient of determination in the range 0.957â€“0.999 in all cases indicated predictions of regression were in very good agreement with the data.
