<p>In order to understand the processes behind the current results, despite the high level of research which has already taken place on various EOs as the antimicrobial agents of polymers, systematic studies on the principles of release of EO components from PP films are very scarce. There are diffusion and partitioning processes to be explored as major factors in regulating the freeing of the EO from the PP matrix, for example. It is worth noting that, in all cases investigated, the final amount of the EO released at equilibrium was lower than the nominal content in the films. This aspect can be ascribed to two phenomena: (a) the EO tends to volatilize, especially at the high temperatures required for melt processing; (b) a certain aliquot of the EO remains entrapped inside the matrix [
