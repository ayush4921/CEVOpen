 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-00906-f005">Figure 5</xref>. The yield of identified components equated to 98.9%, with 28 compounds being identified in total. Carvone was the major component in the EO derived from caraway seeds (66.5%), followed by limonene (23.2%). Numerous minor substances were also recognized, as listed in the literature, e.g., myrcene, linalool oxide and limonene oxide, linalool, and carveol [

Carvone (2-Methyl-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-2-en-1-one) is probably one of the most widespread monoterpenoids of natural compounds, owing to its biological and pharmacological properties, including anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antioxidant, antitumour, and insecticidal activities [
