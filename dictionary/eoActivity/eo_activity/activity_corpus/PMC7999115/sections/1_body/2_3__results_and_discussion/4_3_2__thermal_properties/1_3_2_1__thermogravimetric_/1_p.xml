 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-00906-f003">Figure 3</xref> displays thermograms obtained from thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of neat PP, caraway EO, carrier TC with immobilized EO, and polymeric PP film filled with the TC/EO at the theoretical concentration of 20 wt% (PP/TC/20EO). The degradation temperature of the caraway EO, in approximate terms, equalled 140 °C, in agreement with data in the literature [
 <xref rid="B11-polymers-13-00906" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and one decomposition peak was discerned related to complete destruction of organic matter. The thermal stability of the neat EO was slightly compromised after having been incorporated into the TC carrier due to access by heat facilitated through disruption caused by the porous structure of the filler aggregates. Inclusion of the enhanced filler into the polymer matrix, however, strengthened the thermal response of the composite. Thermal degradation of PP tends to be reported as occurring via random scission followed by a radical transfer process, with single-step thermal decomposition happening at around 500 °C [

The PP/TC/EO composites show two stages of degradation, though; the first was between 100 and 150 °C, due to a dehydration process where moisture was eliminated from the PP surface and the caraway EO evaporated; the other involved further degradation of the PP to its final products—propylene, pentane, 2-Methyl-1-pentene, and 2,4-Dimethyl-1-heptene. Hence, the degradation temperature of the PP/TC/20EO sample was observed at 443 °C, in comparison with 463 °C for the neat PP film, which indicates filling the PP matrix with a TC carrier is a suitable way to improve its thermal stability [
