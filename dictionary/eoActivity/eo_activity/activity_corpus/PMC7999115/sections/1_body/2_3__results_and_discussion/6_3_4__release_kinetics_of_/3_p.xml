<p>Release of the EO from samples with lesser content of the oil (PP/TC/3EO and PP/TC/7EO) happened in two stages, following the trend of substances immobilized in non-porous aggregated carriers such as TC. When an incorporated EO showed initial rapid release from an aggregated carrier with a surface more accessible to the release medium, which was also well adhered to the surface of the carrier, molecules inside the aggregates were freed by diffusion at a later time. The extent of release was incomplete, reaching 80% maximally in both samples, this potentially stemming from the lesser capability of the caraway EO to evaporate due to encapsulation in the carrier and, thus, the polymer matrix as well. The data obtained correspond with other studies [
