<p>The inhibition zones of the EO derived from

 <xref rid="polymers-13-00906-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. The EO generated larger zones of inhibition against the gram-positive bacterial strain (about 14 mm) compared to the gram-negative one (4.3 mm). Similar results were published in a study on the antimicrobial activity of bioactive components of essential oils derived from spices from Pakistan against salmonella and other multi-drug resistant bacteria [

 <xref rid="B63-polymers-13-00906" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], gram-negative bacteria are more resistant to EOs than gram-positive bacteria, a phenomenon caused by the differences between them in cell wall structure. As reported by Nazzaro et al. [
 <xref rid="B64-polymers-13-00906" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], the structure of the gram-positive bacteria cell wall allows hydrophobic molecules to move easily through the porins of the cells. In other words, gram-negative bacteria are less sensitive to the EOs because of their lipopolysaccharide outer membrane, which restricts the diffusion of hydrophobic compounds [
 <xref rid="B65-polymers-13-00906" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. No inhibition zones were discerned for any of the film samples, possibly caused by the EO being well consolidated on the TC. Other authors have failed to demonstrate this advantage of incorporating an EO in the inert carrier in their studies on directly mixing EOs with different polymers; therein, the EOs migrated very fast and created zones of inhibition [
