 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-00906-f006">Figure 6</xref> reveals the significant influence exerted by the concentration of caraway EO in the samples on the rate of release, with considerable differences visible between the four types of films. All the samples exhibited a burst release within the first few hours of the experiment, which then plateaued due to the progressive depletion of carvone [

This is why those with higher concentrations of the EO demonstrated rapid and complete release of the EO entrapped (with a release rate of 90â€“100%). A lesser amount of EO brought about reduced and slower release of the compound, the actual release rate barely reaching 75%. The rate of the burst effect was dependent on concentration of EO, e.g., samples with greater concentrations of the EO showed higher rates; thus, larger amounts of the EO failed to incorporate in the TC aggregates and were able to evaporate. This finding is valid for samples containing high levels of the EO (PP/TC/10EO and PP/TC/20EO).
