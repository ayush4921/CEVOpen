<p>The data on antibacterial activity on the surfaces of the samples are summarized in 
 <xref rid="polymers-13-00906-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. Assays to test such activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria by the prepared films with the EO showed it took place against both bacterial strains [
 <xref rid="B67-polymers-13-00906" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. The mixture of PP and TC showed no antibacterial activity in either case; indeed, it is known from Kneuer et al. [
 <xref rid="B68-polymers-13-00906" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] that TC is a biologically inert and inactive material. The data obtained herein demonstrate the high antimicrobial efficiency of the EO at a theoretical concentration of more than 10% (actual EO content 4.9 ± 0.2 wt%). Comparing the results of antibacterial activity with those for release reveals that samples PP/TC/10EO and PP/TC/20EO lost in excess of 50% of the EO from the matrix during the first 24 h. Therefore, this amount of EO was freely available for interaction with the bacterial cells. It can be also seen that the caraway EO was more effective against the gram-positive bacterial strain, in accordance with the findings above. The antibacterial activity exerted by sample PP/TC/20EO was determined again after 5 weeks, following storage in a polyethylene bag at room temperature and the relative humidity of 40%. The results indicated that the sample still showed very strong antibacterial activity against both bacterial strains (
