<p>It was observed that adding the caraway EO reduced values for Young’s modulus by about 14%, 18%, 62%, and 73% and those for tensile strength by approximately 7%, 14%, 32%, and 63%, in line with rise in EO concentration. This behaviour could have been caused by the plasticizing effects of the EO (in free form caused by evaporation) in the polymer matrix, thereby heightening the ductile properties. Three theories exist to explain this plasticizing mechanism: (i) the lubricity theory, which considers that the plasticizer acts as a lubricant to reduce friction and facilitates mobility of the polymer chains to pass one another, thereby diminishing deformation; (ii) the gel theory, suggesting that a plasticizer disrupts and replaces polymer–polymer interactions that hold polymer chains together; and (iii) the free volume theory, whereby any polymeric material is defined as the internal space available in a polymer for the movement of chains [

 <xref rid="B44-polymers-13-00906" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], thymol EO functioned as a plasticizer, minimizing the intermolecular forces of the polymer chains, thus enhancing the flexibility and the extensibility of the films. Similar results were described by Llana-Ruiz-Cabello [

This highlights that EOs not only provide an antibacterial function but also heighten the flexibility of PP composites which contain reinforcing fillers [

The improved mechanical properties can be also caused by the TC surface modification with EO considering that the modification of TC surface with EO presumably increases TC surface hydrophobicity and thus improves the interaction strength at the PP/TC interface.
