<p>There is still a lack of data on thermoplastic incorporation of caraway EO into a PP matrix and the manner of its interaction with polymer composites. It is important to highlight that EO-based antibacterial agents are not easy to incorporate into polymer matrices due to their volatility. This drawback is overcome by immobilizing the antibacterial agents on inert carriers commonly utilized as plastic fillers. Herein, a study was made on the immobilization of caraway in a PP polymer matrix, aided by an inert carrier of talc for antimicrobial modification of the polymeric surface. The effect of incorporating the caraway essential oil was observed on the resultant thermal and mechanical properties, such as tensile strength, strain at break, and Youngâ€™s modulus. The antimicrobial activity of the EO was also evaluated against selected pathogenic microorganisms.</p>
