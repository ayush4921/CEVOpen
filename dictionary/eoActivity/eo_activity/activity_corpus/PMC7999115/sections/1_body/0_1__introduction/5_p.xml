<p>An issue debated in society concerns what happens to polymeric materials at the end of their useful life for reasons of environmental safety and sustainability, as most packaging materials are non-biodegradable. Biodegradable polymers represent an alternative to conventional plastics, although certain limitations exist in extending their real-world application and furthering industrial utilization, such as high cost, insufficient mechanical performance, and inferior thermal stability [

Although forms of conventional plastics are still widely employed by manufacturers, an endeavour is being made to use recycled materials and heighten the utility value of the original ones. Plastics such as polyolefins can contribute to a circular economy, as they are recyclable and/or reusable [

Polypropylene (PP) is an example of one with numerous industrial applications as a consequence of its low cost, excellent chemical resistance, low density, and high tensile strength. Short glass fibres and talc are common fillers in PP systems [
