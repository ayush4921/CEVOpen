 <xref rid="B23-polymers-13-00906" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] characterized the antimicrobial activity of PP films supplemented with oregano EO and extract of allium for the packaging of ham by directly mixing the PP and the EOs with a thermal degradation temperature of ca 200 °C. Another focused on blown films of PP with the addition of 0–5% talc, which, following thermal processes, were impregnated after preparation with an EO extracted from lemons [
