<p>EOs derived from plants are secondary metabolites that act as defence mechanisms for the same and its fruits and seeds. This has resulted in application of them for their medicinal properties, including antimicrobial and antioxidant activity, brought about by the given content of proteins, vitamins, and volatile compounds [
 <xref rid="B9-polymers-13-00906" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Due to its smell, flavour, and natural antimicrobial characteristics, EO derived from caraway is primarily utilized in the food industry for preserving goods and lending them an aroma [

 <italic>p</italic>-Cymene, pinene, cuminaledehyde, limonene, and carvone and boasts antimicrobial and antioxidant properties [

A major component is carvone, and its metabolites comprise monoterpenes in the derived EO that are of interest due to their antibacterial, antifungal, anticonvulsant, and cytotoxic qualities, for instance; the latter relates to cancer cell lines [
 <xref rid="B10-polymers-13-00906" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Since carvone is a major constituent of caraway EO, it is employed as a natural inhibitor of germination, especially for potatoes and onions in storage [
