<p>Antibacterial activity was tested according to ISO 22196:2011 [
 <xref rid="B30-polymers-13-00906" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Prior to this, the samples were disinfected with 70% ethanol in water. Two bacterial strains suspensions were utilized (
 <italic>E. coli</italic> 2.7 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL; 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> 6.6 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL), which were prepared in 1/500 nutrient broth. The subsequent bacterial suspension was applied on the surface of the samples (of dimensions 25 × 25 mm) at the volume of 100 µL; then, each sample was covered with inert polypropylene foil (of dimensions 20 × 20 mm). These were cultivated at 35 ± 1 °C and min. 90% RH for 24 h. After the period of incubation, the cover foil was removed, and each sample was completely washed with SCDLP broth. The pour plate method was employed to determine the viable bacteria count. Incubation at 35 ± 1 °C took place for another 48 h, at the end of which the number of viable bacteria recovered per cm
 <sup>2</sup> per test specimen was enumerated in accordance with Equation (2):
