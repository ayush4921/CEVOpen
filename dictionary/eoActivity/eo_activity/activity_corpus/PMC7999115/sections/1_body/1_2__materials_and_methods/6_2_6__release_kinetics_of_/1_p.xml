<p>The thermal desorption technique was employed to determine the release test, in addition to which the concentration assessment of the EO directly after thermoplastic processing was carried out. Analyses were conducted with the aid of a Multi-Shot Pyrolyzer unit, model EGA/PY-3030D (Frontier Laboratories Ltd., Fukushima, Japan), connected to the GC/MS device mentioned above. Samples of approximately 3 mg with different amounts of the caraway EO were weighed, and a part of each sample was removed for analysis (to gauge actual EO content following preparation of the samples; see 
 <xref rid="polymers-13-00906-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The remaining portions of them were heated at the temperature of 40 °C for a predetermined time for the release test. They were transferred into a pyrolysis cup and pyrolyzed at 250 °C for a duration of 1 min, which was sufficient for the sample to melt and ensure pyrolytic decomposition of its components did not occur. Separation was carried out on an Ultra alloy-PY2 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.5 µm, Frontier Laboratories Ltd., Fukushima, Japan). The temperature of 300 °C was applied for the GC injector and the interface between the pyroprobe and GC device; a split injector ratio of 1:150. The oven temperature of the GC equalled 80 °C and was held for 1 min, followed by two instances of continuous heating, initially (at 20 °C/min) to 170 °C and again (at 35 °C/min) to 300 °C for 4 min. Helium constituted the carrier gas at the column flow of 1.2 mL/min. The temperatures of the ion source and the MS interface equalled 250 °C and 300 °C, respectively. The scan speed was set at 1666 over a range of 35–350
