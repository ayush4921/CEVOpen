<p>GC/MS was performed on a GCMS-QP2010 Ultra device (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a fused silica capillary column (Rxi-5ms, 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm, Restek, Bellefonte, PA, USA). Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 0.96 mL/min. The temperature of the injection was maintained at 230 °C at a split ratio of 1:50, the volume of the injected sample equalling 1 µL The temperature of the column was held at 50 °C for 1 min and then increased to 250 °C at a rate of 15 °C/min, a temperature which was maintained for 1 min. The temperatures of the ion source (EI, 70 eV) and the interface were set at 220 °C and 230 °C, respectively. The range of the scan was 35–350 (
