 <sup>7</sup> CFU/mL. The neat caraway EO or the solution with concentrations of 0.1% or 1.0% (in ethanol) of the EO were pipetted into wells (8 mm in diameter) on plates with Mueller-Hinton agar inoculated with the bacterial suspension (2 wells in a single Petri dish, with plates in duplicate; at the volume of 0.1 mL), followed by incubation at 35 ± 2 °C for 24 h. The films were tested in the same manner, the only difference being that disc-shaped pieces of the films (8 mm in diameter) were placed directly on such agar plates. Thereafter, the width of the inhibition zone for each sample was measured. The lack of effect by the ethanol solvent was confirmed by determining the zero zone of inhibition of pure ethanol against both bacterial strains.
