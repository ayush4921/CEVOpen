<p>The TC carrier was activated under isothermal conditions at 160 °C for 30 min. Then, the EO was immobilized in the carrier by an isothermal process (25 °C) in a closed glass flask, which contained the caraway EO and the carrier at a ratio 1:2 (
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>) in order to obtain an additive suitable for thermoplastic processing. The PP masterbatch was prepared by a thermoplastic method with the EO incorporated on the TC in the manner mentioned above so as to achieve a theoretical content of EO at 20 wt%, TC at 40 wt%, and PP at 40 wt%. Thereafter, samples intended for testing were prepared from the masterbatch, neat TC and PP, as follows.
