<p>The mixture of the PP and the additive underwent melt compounding in an internal Brabender mixer (Plastograph
 <sup>®</sup> EC plus, Mixer 50EHT32, Duisburg, Germany) equipped with two stainless steel screws and a bypass valve to allow continuous recirculation of the material. The neat TC and PP were heated to and melted at 180 °C, the mixer running for approximately 15 min at the operating speed of 110 rpm. After stabilizing the degree of torque, a calculated amount of masterbatch was added, the process continuing for another 5 min to achieve a sample with a defined theoretical content of EO. The designation and the composition of the samples are summarized in 
 <xref rid="polymers-13-00906-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Finally, the resultant products underwent compression moulding at 180 °C for 5 min in a manual press to create several films (each approximately 200 µm thick), which were subsequently cooled under the pressure of 10 MPa for 5 min.
