<p>The ASTM D882-12 [
 <xref rid="B25-polymers-13-00906" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] standard method was applied to gauge the tensile properties of the films on a tensile testing unit (M350-5CT, Testometric Co. Ltd., Rochdale, UK). Samples were prepared from strips of the films, with dimensions of 80 mm in length, 4.20 mm in width, and ca 200–220 µm thick. Prior to testing, all the samples were conditioned for 48 h at 23 ± 2 °C and relative humidity 50 ± 2% The samples were subsequently stretched at a speed of 50 mm/min, and the parameters of tensile strength, strain at break, and Young’s modulus were determined. Measurements were performed on five duplicates.
