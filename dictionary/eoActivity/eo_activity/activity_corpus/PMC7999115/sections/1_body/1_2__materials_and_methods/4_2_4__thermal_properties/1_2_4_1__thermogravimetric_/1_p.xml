<p>Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on TGA Q500 device (TA Instruments, Wilmington, DE, USA). Samples with an approximate weight of 10 mg were placed in the platinum pan and heated, after equilibration, at temperatures ranging between 25–800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min in a nitrogen atmosphere at the constant flow rate of 60 mL/min. A data set was calculated from the percentage of additive remaining in each film after processing.</p>
