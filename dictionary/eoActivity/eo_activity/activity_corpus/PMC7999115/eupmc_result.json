    "This study investigates antibacterial polymer composites based on polypropylene as modified by caraway essential oil at various concentrations, the latter immobilized on a talc. The caraway essential oil is incorporated in the polypropylene by a thermoplastic processing method. Analysis of the morphology of the composites was carried out by scanning electron microscopy. The chemical composition of the caraway essential oil in addition to its efficiency of incorporation and release were evaluated by GC/MS and Pyrolysis-GC/MS techniques, respectively. Determination was made as to the influence of such incorporation on thermal and tensile properties of the samples, while antibacterial activity was evaluated through conducting disk diffusion tests and measurement with adherence to the ISO 22196:2011 standard. It was found that incorporating the caraway essential oil in the samples did not affect the homogeneity of the thermoplastic-processed composites at any studied concentration. Stress-strain analysis confirmed the plasticizing effect of the essential oil in the polypropylene matrix, in addition to which, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) analysis revealed that the prepared compositions with essential oil exhibited similar thermal properties to neat polypropylene. Results indicated significant antibacterial activity against <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> and <i>Escherichia coli</i> at the concentration of essential oil of 4.9 Â± 0.2 wt% and higher."
