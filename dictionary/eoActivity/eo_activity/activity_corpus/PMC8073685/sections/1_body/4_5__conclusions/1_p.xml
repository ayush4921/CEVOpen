<p>The results of the current preliminary research are novel and important because they show that the goldenrod herb extract limits the growth of the planktonic forms of UPEC and the formation of biofilm mass at early stages of culture. It shows no synergistic effect in combination with antibiotics and shortens the duration of the post-antibiotic effect of both amikacin and ciprofloxacin. When deciding to use a combination of 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic> extract and amikacin/ciprofloxacin, it is necessary to take into account their antagonistic activity.
