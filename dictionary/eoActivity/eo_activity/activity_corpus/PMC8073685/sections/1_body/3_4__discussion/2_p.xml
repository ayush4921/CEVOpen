<p>The dynamic development of antibiotic treatment greatly facilitated the fight against bacterial infections. Unfortunately, the widespread abuse and misuse of antibiotics have led to an increase in the drug resistance of many bacterial strains. Therefore, the role of herbal medicine as an alternative to antibiotic therapy is increasingly being raised. Research on already-known plant products is now being conducted on a large scale and several phytotherapeutics have been found. Essential oils (EOs) are one of the subjects of research for use as an alternative in combating pathogenic bacteria for humans. EOs contain terpenes such as carvacrol, menthol, geraniol and thymol, possessing antimicrobial properties [

 <xref rid="B39-pharmaceutics-13-00573" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] investigated the antibacterial potential of different EOs against multidrug-resistant UPECs. The obtained results revealed that clove and oregano EOs were the most active agents compared with other assessed EOs. Nabti et al. [
 <xref rid="B40-pharmaceutics-13-00573" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] determined the antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>Origanum glandulosum</italic> EOs against multidrug-resistant UPECs. EOs were active against all the tested strains, showing similar inhibition zone diameters, as well as MIC and MBC values. Le et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-pharmaceutics-13-00573" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] investigated the bioactivities of the essential oil of 
 <italic>Atalantia sessiflora</italic> against drug-resistant 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> ATCC 35218, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> ATCC 27853, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 43300 and different clinical strains (S
 <italic>. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>). The oil showed antimicrobial activities against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> strains. Ebani et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-pharmaceutics-13-00573" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] investigated the antibacterial activity of five EOs against multi-drug resistant UPECs. 
 <italic>Illicium verum</italic> and 
 <italic>Salvia sclarea</italic> oils exhibited moderate growth inhibition against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> strains. Better results have been obtained for 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic>, 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> and 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> oils.
