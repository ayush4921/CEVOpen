<p>There are numerous data on the antibacterial properties of plant polyphenols. The therapeutic (including antibacterial) properties of propolis, which contains large amounts of flavonoids, are widely known [
 <xref rid="B50-pharmaceutics-13-00573" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. A group of polyphenols which is particularly common in red and purple fruit (cherries, raspberries, blueberries), showing bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects against many pathogens such as 
 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic>, 
 <italic>Klebsiella</italic>, 
 <italic>Helicobacter</italic> and 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> is anthocyanins [
 <xref rid="B51-pharmaceutics-13-00573" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In the study on the antibacterial properties of the extract from 
 <italic>Solidago chilensis</italic> rhizomes, its growth inhibitory effect on 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> strains was observed. In this extract, caffeic and chlorogenic acids are present [
 <xref rid="B52-pharmaceutics-13-00573" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Polyphenolic compounds, due to the presence of various chemical groups, including hydroxyl residues, tend to be incorporated into lipid membranes, causing changes in their fluidity and permeability. This increases the susceptibility of pathogens to antibacterial agents and may generate the outflux of cytoplasmic substances which are essential for the microbe, thus inhibiting the growth of the microorganism [

 <xref rid="B52-pharmaceutics-13-00573" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Studies using plant extracts and polyphenols isolated from them confirm that these compounds may show synergism with each other and with other antimicrobial agents in terms of a biocidal/biostatic activity. In many cases, stronger effects of mixtures of plant compounds than their individual components are observed, as well as an increase in the activity of antibiotics when they are administered together with these compounds. It has been demonstrated that quercetin increases the permeability of bacterial cell membranes, which may increase their susceptibility to antibiotics even in the case of pathogens showing drug resistance [

 <xref rid="B53-pharmaceutics-13-00573" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Quave et al. [
 <xref rid="B54-pharmaceutics-13-00573" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] showed that a mixture of compounds derived from blackberries (
 <italic>Rubus ulmifolius</italic>) which contain ellagic acid (among other components), intensified the effects of daptomycin, clindamycin and oxacillin against a methicillin-sensitive 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MSSA) strain. They also observed a significant inhibition of biofilm formation by both the MSSA strain and methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MRSA) in the presence of blackberry extract [
 <xref rid="B54-pharmaceutics-13-00573" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The biofilm forms show much greater resistance to antibiotics than the planktonic forms. The inclusion of natural plant compounds in biofilm structure weakens the bacterial adhesion to the invaded surface, which in turn reduces the formation of biofilm mass. In this way, the synergism of the activity of drugs and plant metabolites can be explained.
