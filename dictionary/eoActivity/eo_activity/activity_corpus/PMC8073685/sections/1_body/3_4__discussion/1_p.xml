 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic> is a plant that has been used in traditional medicine for centuries as an agent in the prevention and treatment of various diseases [

 <xref rid="B20-pharmaceutics-13-00573" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, the number of reports describing the antibacterial effect of the goldenrod extracts is very limited [
 <xref rid="B29-pharmaceutics-13-00573" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-pharmaceutics-13-00573" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-pharmaceutics-13-00573" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Thiem and Goślińska [
 <xref rid="B29-pharmaceutics-13-00573" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] analyzed the bactericidal properties of methanolic and ethanolic extracts of goldenrod herbs against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacillus pumilis</italic>, 
 <italic>Proteus mirabilis</italic>, 
 <italic>Proteus vulgaris</italic>, 
 <italic>Micrococcus luteus</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic>. The authors established the MBC values (the minimum bactericidal concentration) of goldenrod extracts using the diffusion method. In the case of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> rods, the MBC value of the ethanol extract was 31.2 mg/mL, whereas that of the methanol extract was 62.5 mg/mL. Demir et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-pharmaceutics-13-00573" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] studied the antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic> methanol extract against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> ATCC 35218, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> ATCC 25922, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 25923, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> ATCC 27853, 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> ATCC 29213, 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> NRLL B-3008, 
 <italic>Enterobacter feacalis</italic> ATCC 292112 and five clinical 
 <italic>Klebsiella pnemoniae</italic> isolates using the disc diffusion method. The growth inhibition zones were present only for 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> ATCC 25922, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. feacalis</italic>. Anžlovar and Koce [
 <xref rid="B31-pharmaceutics-13-00573" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] determined the antibacterial activities of four different 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic> extracts (acetone, methanolic, ethanolic and aqueous) against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. None of the extracts limited the growth of the tested bacterial strains. The above-described studies, although interesting, are limited to determining only the values of MBC and the zone of inhibition of bacterial growth. In our study, apart from determining the MIC value, the effect of the extract of 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic>, as well as its combination with antibiotics, on the survival of bacteria, biofilm formation and the duration of the post-antibiotic effect of amikacin and ciprofloxacin was also determined. In the current study, the MIC value of goldenrod methanol extract was established, which was 45 mg/mL. The extract decreased the number of bacterial cells in planktonic cultures and limited the biofilm-mass formation in young biofilm.
