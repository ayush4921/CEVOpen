<p>To summarize the research presented here, it can be stated that the goldenrod herb extract limited the growth of the planktonic forms of UPEC at a very early stage of culture and decreased the production of 24-h biofilm. However, the addition of the extract to amikacin and ciprofloxacin did not enhance their antibacterial activity, nor did it extend the duration of PAE and PASME. On the contrary, in the cultures treated with both the extract and antibiotic, the number of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> bacteria increased. The amount of biofilm mass they formed also increased and the post-antibiotic effect became shorter. The results of our research indicate that the plant extract does not always show synergistic and bacteriostatic activity with antibiotics. The causes of this phenomenon may include (i) ’competition’ between molecules of plant origin and antibiotic molecules for a specific target site in a bacterial cell or blocking of the capture region for these molecules; (ii) direct interactions between plant substances and antibiotics, leading to a reduction in drug activity; (iii) the ability of bacteria to transform active forms of plant metabolites into less active ones that cannot support drug activity. To understand the exact mechanisms responsible for these interactions, further and more detailed research is needed.
