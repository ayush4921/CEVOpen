 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic> extract and antibiotics is not to be found. Therefore, we consider our research and the results obtained to be original and innovative, expanding the knowledge of the effects of antibiotics and 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic>. One of the main objectives of the research presented in this paper was to determine the effect of both subinhibitory concentrations of the European goldenrod herb extract and mixtures of this extract with subinhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin and amikacin on planktonic and biofilm cultures of uropathogenic 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. The research hypothesis assumed the synergistic effect of the goldenrod herb extract and both antibiotics. However, the results showed that the methanol extract from 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic> at a concentration of 0.25× MIC does not support the activity of the drugs against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> strain. This extract exhibited an antagonistic effect against ciprofloxacin and amikacin, which manifested itself in their weaker activity against both planktonic bacteria and biofilm bacteria. The available literature indicates that the causes of this phenomenon should be sought in the chemical composition and mechanisms of activity of the extract. For instance, the goldenrod extract contains polyphenols, of which the effects are very various. The activity of certain groups of bacteria is decreased by some polyphenols, whereas other species are stimulated to grow by the same compounds. Tzounis et al. [
