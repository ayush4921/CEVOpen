<p>Scientists have proven that during antibiotic therapy it is possible to reduce the toxic dose of a drug by extending the time between successive doses administered to the patient [
 <xref rid="B28-pharmaceutics-13-00573" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Therefore, the determination of PAE and PASME is a good basis for planning the treatment with some chemotherapeutic agents. Hence, our research aimed to determine the PAE and PASME of ciprofloxacin and amikacin in the presence of the goldenrod herb extract. The research hypothesis assumed that the duration of PAE and PASME of ciprofloxacin and amikacin would be extended in the presence of goldenrod herb extract. However, our results indicated that preincubation of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> with drugs and 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic> extracts shortened the duration of both PAE and PASME. Therefore, the hypothesis posed at the beginning of the study proved to be false. The study results differed from these obtained by D’Arrigo et al. [
 <xref rid="B36-pharmaceutics-13-00573" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], who determined the duration of PAE and PASME of tobramycin combined with tea tree oil against gram-positive 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and gram-negative 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> bacteria. Tobramycin at concentrations of 1× MIC and 2× MIC was used in the study. The duration of PAE against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> rods was longer when using tobramycin at 1× MIC and lasted 1 h 20 min. This time increased to 10 h 50 min when 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> rods were short-term treated with a mixture of tobramycin (1× MIC) and tea tree oil (0.05%). A similar dependence was observed when using antibiotics in subinhibitory concentrations of 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3× MIC, in which the duration of PASME was 2 h 40 min, 3 h 20 min and 5 h 20 min, respectively. After plant oil addition, the above-mentioned duration of PASME was extended to 13 h 40 min, 14 h 30 min and 15 h, respectively. The duration of the PAE of tobramycin against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> at 1× MIC was 1 h 40 min and it was extended to 10 h 25 min after tea tree oil (0.25%) was added to tobramycin. Interestingly, after 0.5% plant oil was added, the duration of PAE was extended to 17 h 25 min. After 0.5% tea tree oil was added to subinhibitory concentrations of tobramycin, the duration of PASME was twice as long as with the use of 0.25% oil. The above-mentioned results show that tea tree oil extended the growth inhibition time of both 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Aboulmagd et al. [
 <xref rid="B55-pharmaceutics-13-00573" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] also studied the PAE using imipenem and 
 <italic>Camellia sinensis</italic> green tea leaf extract against the MRSA strain. In the experiment, the plant extract at 0.25× MIC and the antibiotic at 1, 2 and 3× MIC were used. The duration of PAE was imipenem-concentration-dependent and ranged from 1 h 30 min to 2 h 50 min. After the green tea leaf extract was added, PAE was extended to 2 h 55 min–4 h 40 min. Braga et al. [
 <xref rid="B56-pharmaceutics-13-00573" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] conducted an experiment on MRSA and MSSA clinical strains. In their study, the effect of a 
 <italic>Punica pomegranate</italic> methanolic extract on the duration of PAE of ampicillin was determined. PAE was extended from 3 to 7 h. Hussin et al. [
 <xref rid="B57-pharmaceutics-13-00573" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] examined the duration of the PAE of tetracycline combined with extracts from pomegranate, thyme, myrrh balm and cornelian against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. The presence of extracts from pomegranate, myrrh balm and thyme significantly increased the duration of PAE of tetracycline to 3, 4 and 5 h, respectively. The results obtained by the above-mentioned scientists differ significantly from those presented in the current report. Those papers [

 <xref rid="B57-pharmaceutics-13-00573" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] present synergism in the interaction of plant extracts with antibiotics, expressed in the extension of the growth inhibition time of bacteria. In the current authors’ research, however, it has been shown that the use of the goldenrod herb extract shortens the duration of the PAE and PASME of both ciprofloxacin and amikacin.
