 <italic>Solidaginis virgaureae herba</italic> was purchased from the herbs confectioning factory “FLOS”, general partnership (Mokrsko, Poland), with marketing authorization number R/1957. Dried plant material (50 g) was ground and extracted with MeOH (0.5 L) for 24 h at room temperature. The methanol extract was concentrated to dry residue. For UHPLC analysis, the dried methanol extract was re-dissolved in MS-grade MeOH to a 1 mg/mL concentration. One milliliter of the sample was filtered using 0.22 μm PTFE single-use syringe filters (Merck-Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), and stored at 4 °C before analysis.
