<p>The biofilm production assay was performed according to [
 <xref rid="B34-pharmaceutics-13-00573" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] with slight modifications, as described previously [
 <xref rid="B35-pharmaceutics-13-00573" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Samples were prepared in microtiter plate wells by adding the appropriate volume of 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic> extract, amikacin, ciprofloxacin, 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic> extract with amikacin and 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic> extract with ciprofloxacin to 200 μL of MHB containing 20 μL of culture of bacteria (0.5 in the McFarland scale). On the basis of ODs of bacterial biofilm, the bacteria were classified as follows: OD ≤ ODc: no biofilm producer; ODc &lt; OD ≤ 2× ODc: weak biofilm producer; 2× ODc &lt; OD ≤ 4× ODc: moderate biofilm producer; OD &gt; 4× ODc: strong biofilm producer. In our study, the ODc value was 0.197. The experiment was repeated three times for each growth condition and the results were averaged.
