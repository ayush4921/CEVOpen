<p>After incubation for 2 h, bacteria were diluted to obtain an inoculum of approximately 5 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> CFU/mL at the beginning of the experiment. To determine the PAE values, the strain was exposed to 1× MIC of amikacin, 1× MIC ciprofloxacin, 1× MIC of amikacin with 0.25× MIC of 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic> extract, and 1× MIC of ciprofloxacin with 0.25× MIC of 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic> extract. To determine the PASME values, the strain was exposed to 0.5× MIC of amikacin, 0.5× MIC ciprofloxacin, 0.5× MIC of amikacin with 0.25× MIC of 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic> extract, and 0.5× MIC of ciprofloxacin with 0.25× MIC of 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic> extract. The sample containing unexposed bacteria was the control. All samples were shaken aerobically in a water bath at 37 °C for 1 h. The antimicrobial agents were washed out using PBS and centrifugation (4000× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min). The control culture was also centrifuged. The treated and control cultures were placed in fresh MHB and were incubated in a water bath at 37 °C for 24 h. Growth was monitored hourly for 7 h and after 24 h by removing 100-µL samples, performing serial dilutions, and determining the number of CFU of the sample per mL on agar plates [
