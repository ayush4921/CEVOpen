<p>The total phenolic content of the methanol extract from 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic> herbs was determined using the Folin–Ciocâlteu method, as described previously by Chandra et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-pharmaceutics-13-00573" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] with slight modifications. The content of total phenolics was expressed as mg gallic acid equivalents GAE/g of dry plant extract. The evaluation of the total flavonoid content of the extract from 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic> herbs was performed using a spectrophotometric method [
 <xref rid="B32-pharmaceutics-13-00573" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The flavonoid content was expressed as mg quercetin equivalents QE/g of dry plant extract. The absorbance of the reaction mixtures was measured with a Thermo Scientific Multiskan GO UV/VIS spectrophotometer. The experiments were performed in triplicate.
