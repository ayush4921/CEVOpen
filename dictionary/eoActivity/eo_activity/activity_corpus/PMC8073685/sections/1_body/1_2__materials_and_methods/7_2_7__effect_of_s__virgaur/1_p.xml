<p>The bacteria were grown overnight on nutrient agar (Biomed, Poland) and then transferred to MHB and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Following incubation, the bacterial culture was centrifuged (4000 rpm; 20 min) and suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to obtain the final density of 0.5 in the McFarland scale. Bacterial suspension and antimicrobial agents were mixed together to obtain proper sub-inhibitory concentrations in each sample (0.25× MIC for 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic> extract and 0.5× MIC for antibiotics). Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, then diluted and cultured on nutrient agar plates. After 0, 1, 3, 5, and 24 h of incubation at 37 °C the number of CFU/mL was counted. Control samples in all experiments contained no antibiotics or plant extract.
