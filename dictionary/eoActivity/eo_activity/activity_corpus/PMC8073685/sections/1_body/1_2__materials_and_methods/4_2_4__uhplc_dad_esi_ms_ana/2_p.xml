<p>The instrument was calibrated with sodium formate cluster ions. The analyses of the obtained mass spectra were carried out using Data Analysis (Bruker Daltonics) software. The main instrumental parameters were as follows: scan range: 50–2200 
 <italic>m/z</italic>; dry gas: nitrogen; temperature: 200 °C; potential between the spray needle and the orifice: 4.2 kV. The gradient elution system consisted of 0.1% HCOOH in water (mobile phase A) and 0.1% HCOOH in acetonitrile (mobile phase B). At the flow rate of 0.3 mL/min, the following elution program was used: 0→30 min (5→95% B), 30→40 min (95% B), 40→45 min (95→5% B), 45→50 min (5% B). All analyses were carried out isothermally at 30 °C. The injection volume was 3 μL.
