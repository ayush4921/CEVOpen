<p>Tentative identification of the main compounds recorded by LC-DAD was performed on the basis of their accurate masses using high-resolution mass spectrometry. The mass accuracy for all separated compounds was within 2 ppm. The identified compounds and their MS data are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-13-00573-f001">Figure 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pharmaceutics-13-00573-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The main peaks on the UHPLC-chromatogram belong to chlorogenic acid, rutin and caffeoylquinic acid isomers. These compounds were previously described in 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic> and some other 
 <italic>Solidago</italic> species [
 <xref rid="B2-pharmaceutics-13-00573" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-pharmaceutics-13-00573" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, we were unable to characterize the compound corresponding to peak 8 at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 349.0934. The total phenolic and total flavonoid content of the goldenrod methanol extract were determined and they were 50.83 mg GAE/g dry weight and 33.15 QE/g dry weight, respectively.
