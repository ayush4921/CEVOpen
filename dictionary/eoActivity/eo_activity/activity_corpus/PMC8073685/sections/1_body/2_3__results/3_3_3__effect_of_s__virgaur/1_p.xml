<p>Analysis of the data presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-13-00573-f002">Figure 2</xref> shows that 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic> extract exhibits antibacterial effects compared to the control sample. However, the strongest and most effective anti-growth effect of the goldenrod extract was found in young 1- and 3-h bacterial cultures (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05). The hypothesis of our research assumed that the extract would show a synergistic effect with the antibiotics amikacin and ciprofloxacin, commonly used in the treatment of UTIs. However, the research results do not support this assumption. It can be noted that 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> showed better growth in mixtures containing both 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic> extract and antibiotics than in the samples in which bacteria were incubated with the drug itself. This situation was observed in T
 <sub>5</sub> and T
 <sub>24</sub> cultures (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05). Thus, the subinhibitory concentration of the goldenrod extract (0.25× MIC) does not support the activity of ciprofloxacin and amikacin. On the contrary, it shows a protective effect against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> treated with antibiotics.
