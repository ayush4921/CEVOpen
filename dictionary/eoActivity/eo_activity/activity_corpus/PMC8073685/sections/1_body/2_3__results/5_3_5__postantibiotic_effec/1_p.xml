<p>The duration of PAE of ciprofloxacin, amikacin and 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic> extract, as well as their mixtures (antibiotic + extract), against the 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> strain was determined. The results pertaining to the post-antibiotic effects using ciprofloxacin at 1× MIC, amikacin at 1× MIC and plant extract at 0.25× MIC are presented in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-13-00573-f005">Figure 5</xref>. The above-mentioned duration was determined according to the formula: PAE = T−C, where T is the time required for bacteria treated with the drug to increase their number by one logarithmic magnitude (1 log10) above the value found immediately after elimination of the drug (at T
 <sub>0</sub>) and C is the time necessary for the control culture bacteria to increase their number by one logarithmic magnitude compared to T
 <sub>0</sub>. T and C values derived from the charts in
