<p>OD values of control samples at all measurement times (T
 <sub>24</sub>, T
 <sub>48</sub>, T
 <sub>72</sub>) were in the range of 0.197 &lt; OD ≤ 0.394 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-13-00573-f003">Figure 3</xref>), which indicates weak biofilm mass formation by 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> rods. OD values lower than 0.197, indicating the lack of biofilm formation, were observed only in 24-h biofilms treated with ciprofloxacin and amikacin at 0.5× MIC (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05). Analysis of the data in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-13-00573-f003">Figure 3</xref> (24 h) also shows that there was a decrease in biofilm formation for the samples containing the goldenrod extract, as well as its mixtures with antibiotics. In 48-h biofilm cultures, no statistically significant decrease in biofilm-mass formation was noted (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). Therefore, it can be concluded that neither the subinhibitory concentration of 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic> extract (0.25× MIC) nor combinations of drugs with plant extract inhibited the formation of biofilm mass by the 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> strain. It is also noteworthy that in 72-h cultures containing a mixture of subinhibitory levels of drugs and the goldenrod extract, biofilm formation by 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> strain was higher than in the control sample (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05). It seems that the goldenrod extract at 0.25× MIC, when added to biofilm cultures with antibiotics, not only shows protective properties (protecting enterobacteria from drugs) but even stimulates bacteria to form a biofilm.
