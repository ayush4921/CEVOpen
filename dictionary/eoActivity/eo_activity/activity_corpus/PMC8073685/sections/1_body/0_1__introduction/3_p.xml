<p>Urinary tract infections (UTIs) belong to the group of the most frequently mentioned infectious diseases in the human population. The main etiological agent of UTIs, both in hospital-acquired and non-hospital-acquired infections, are uropathogenic 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (UPEC) strains. They possess virulence factors that enable the invasion of the urothelium and cause pathological lesions. In many cases, in spite of antimicrobial treatment, subsequent chronic and recurring UTIs occur. This may be attributable to the ineffectiveness of earlier therapy and the survival of pathogens in the urinary tract in the biofilm form [

Treatment failure is associated with the presence of a polysaccharide matrix surrounding the bacteria growing in the biofilm, which significantly reduces the penetration of its structure by antibiotics. Moreover, pathogens living in the structure of the biofilm show a reduced level of metabolism, which makes it easier for them to survive during antibiotic therapy, as most antibiotics act on actively dividing cells [
