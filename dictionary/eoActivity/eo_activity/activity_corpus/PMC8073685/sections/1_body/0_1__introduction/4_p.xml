<p>Although the etiology of UTIs itself has not changed significantly for years, strains with increasing drug-resistance are being isolated more frequently, which is a very serious clinical problem faced by today’s medicine. This phenomenon results from a continuous (frequently excessive) increase in the use of antibiotics, which results in the formation of drug resistance, especially among clinical strains. For the above reasons, the role of natural medicinal plant materials is increasingly being studied in order to reduce this negative phenomenon [

One antimicrobial agent enhances the activity of the other, and finally they may act together more effectively against drug-resistant bacteria. Some researchers suggest combining antibiotics with plant compounds to either strike multiple targets in the bacterial genome or enhance the potency of the antibiotic by weakening the bacteria’s ability to develop resistance [
