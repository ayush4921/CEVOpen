<p>Several studies have compared 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> with other species of different genera regarding its anti-inflammatory effect. For example, a study compared the anti-inflammatory activity of rhizomes of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> (turmeric), and 
 <italic>Zingiber officinale</italic> (ginger) in rat adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) [
 <xref rid="B39-plants-10-00063" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and showed the anti-inflammatory activity of turmeric over ginger and indomethacin against the rheumatoid arthritis onset/progression displayed in AIA. Another study found that UP1304, a combination containing the standardized extract of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> rhizome and 
 <italic>Morus alba</italic> root, was used to treat symptoms of arthritis [
