<p>The anti-inflammatory role of essential oils (EOs) derived from 
 <italic>Curcuma aromatica</italic> Salisb. rhizomes from twelve places in China was investigated by Xiang [

 <italic>O</italic>-tetradecanolphorbol-13-acetate in rats in their research. Different classes of mice underwent numerous essential oil therapies, where ibuprofen was used to positively regulate them. In general, both EOs demonstrated dose-dependent anti-inflammatory behavior between 20.56 and 61.34%; this was remarkably higher than ibuprofen (17.84–54.57%), which is recognized for its anti-inflammatory effects. Furthermore, tissue healing from inflammation following treatment with both EOs was shown through histological and immunohistochemical studies. The cytokine analysis found that the output of COX2 and TNF-α in the EO-treated groups was substantially decreased relative to the untreated community. Furthermore, extracts of 
 <italic>C. aromatica</italic> rhizomes were documented to possess promising anti-inflammatory activity comparable to prednisolone when evaluated on carrageenan-induced inflamed mice [

 <italic>C. aromatica</italic> extracts and essential oil possess a more potent anti-inflammatory activity than traditional pharmaceutical drugs since they produce and can have the stimulating impact of numerous powerful anti-inflammatory compounds, such 1,8-cineole, ar-turmerone, xanthorrhizole, borneol, curcumin, curdione, and linalool [
