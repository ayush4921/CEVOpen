<p>The present review summarizes the anti-inflammatory properties of the genus 
 <italic>Curcuma</italic>. Based on the published literature, we can conclude with the following remarks. At first, it was observed that only a few species have been scientifically investigated among more than 100 species, where there is not enough published literature for each species, except 
 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic>. Therefore, more scientific investigations are required on every species for their anti-inflammatory effects. Second, except for the roots of 
 <italic>Curcuma zedoaria</italic> only rhizomes have been the subject of scientific investigations. These rhizomes have shown significant anti-inflammatory effects; therefore, scientific investigations on other plant parts may provide evidence for promising anti-inflammatory effects. Third, many published scientific articles showed the anti-inflammatory effects of 
 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> and others in rats and mice. The maceration extraction techniques were followed in the present 
 <italic>Curcuma</italic> studies, while a comparative study of the extract effect is required using other extraction techniques, such as Soxhlet, injection, percolation, and hot extraction. Therefore, further investigations are required in this case. Finally, more scientific research and investigations are required to isolate single entities and constituents that are responsible for specific anti-inflammatory actions.
