 <p>Each day since December 2019, increasing numbers of cases of the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infection are being detected as it spreads throughout all continents of the world except Antarctica. The virus is transmitted through contact with an infected environment or person, and the symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. The healthcare systems of many countries are overwhelmed due to limited therapeutic options and the absence of an approved vaccine. Due to its poor healthcare systems, Africa may be the worst hit continent if other therapeutic alternatives are not explored. This review explores the source and origin of the COVID-19 infection, and alternative therapeutic options derived from available and cheap medicinal foods and plants that have been shown to alleviate similar infections. The results demonstrate the inhibitory activities of selected food crops and plants against human viruses similar to the novel COVID-19.</p>
