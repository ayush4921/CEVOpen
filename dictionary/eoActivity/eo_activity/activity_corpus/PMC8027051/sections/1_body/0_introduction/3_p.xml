<p>Several antiviral drugs have been approved for use, however these drugs have a narrow range of activity against many viral infections (
 <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Babar et al., 2013</xref>). This is because viruses can rapidly mutate, causing new strains to emerge that may exhibit resistance to drugs that target a particular viral component (
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Ahmad et al., 2020</xref>). Several food crops and plants have shown antiviral effects, therefore there is an urgent need to explore these crops/plants as traditional/alternative medicines for therapeutic options in the absence of or alongside insufficient orthodox medications (

 <italic>Nigella sativa</italic> may inhibit the hepatitis C virus (

 <italic>Allium sativum</italic> (garlic) may inhibit infectious bronchitis virus and influenza virus (

 <italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic> (liquorice/licorice) has shown antiviral activity against hepatitis A, hepatitis B, influenza, and HIV-1, and the ability to inhibit replication of SARS-associated coronavirus
