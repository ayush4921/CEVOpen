<p>Viruses are of great danger to human health. They are constantly evolving and are the causes of many global infections. Viruses are highly infectious and are the cause of most pandemics/epidemics in recent history. For example, in 1918 Spanish influenza, described as the deadliest pandemic in recorded history, was caused by the deadly strain of the influenza virus H1N1. H1N1 infected about 500 million people and caused approximately 17∼50 million deaths worldwide (

Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites with a genome composed of either RNA or DNA, and a protein envelope known as a ‘capsid’. Viruses do not possess metabolism and therefore cannot replicate or biosynthesize proteins on their own (
