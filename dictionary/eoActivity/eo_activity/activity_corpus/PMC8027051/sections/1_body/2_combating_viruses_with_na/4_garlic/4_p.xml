<p>Inhalation of essential oil from garlic prevents inflammation and constriction of airways since the compounds easily pass through the air-blood barrier in patients with mild symptoms (

Garlic acts as an immunomodulatory agent against viral pathogens as it possesses mitogenic activity towards human lymphocytes, splenocytes, and thymocytes (

Furthermore, a randomised clinical control trial showed that some organosulphurs in garlic such as nallicin, diallyl sulphide (DAS), and diallyl disulphide are able to upregulate genes responsible for immune responses, and activate apoptosis of infected cells (
 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Charron et al., 2015</xref>). DAS has been reported to exert its antiviral activity via activating nuclear factor erythroid 2p-45 related factor (Nrf2), which controls expression of genes involved in antiviral activity. Nrf2 activation may downregulate ACE2, thereby inhibiting viral attachment and penetration (
