<p>The extracted parts of basil, such as linalool, apigenin, and ursolic acid, show an expansive range of anti-viral action against DNA virus (adenoviruses) and RNA viruses (

Some components of its essential oils (e.g., linalool, thymol, and carvacrol) may inhibit replication of influenza, HIV, and herpes simplex viruses. Linalool and thymol may inhibit haemagglutinin and neuraminidase, proteins important for attachment of influenza to host cells (
