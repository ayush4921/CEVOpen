<p>Ginger may also increase the activities of antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase, which may be helpful in inflammatory reactions triggered by viral infections (

Gingerenone A inhibits Janus kinase 2 and p70S6 kinase, which are crucial in influenza virus replication. Gingerenone A may also prevent H5N1 replication in lungs by inhibiting expression of Janus kinase 2 (

Another study reported that the combination of honey, ginger and garlic is efficacious in inhibiting replication of influenza in mammalian cell lines (Madin-Darby canine kidney cell monolayers) and human lymphocytes, and stimulates proliferation of uninfected T-lymphocytes (
