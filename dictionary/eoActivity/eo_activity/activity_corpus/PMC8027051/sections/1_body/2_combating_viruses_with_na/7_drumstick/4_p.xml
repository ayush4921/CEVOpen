 <sup>2+</sup>) function as an important cofactor of some viral proteins and plays important roles in their survival and pathogenesis. Therefore, accessibility of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> in infected cells may be a limiting factor for viral life cycles. Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> has been reported to play significant functions in the neuropathogenesis of HIV-1 infection, and HIV-induced central nervous system inflammation and neurodegeneration (
