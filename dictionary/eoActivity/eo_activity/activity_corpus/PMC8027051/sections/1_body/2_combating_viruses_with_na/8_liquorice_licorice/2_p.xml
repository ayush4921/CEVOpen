 <xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">Michaelis et al., 2010</xref>). Glycyrrhizin, the major active component of 
 <italic>G. glabra</italic> is responsible for anti-viral activity against several viruses, including herpes simplex virus, hepatitis A, B, and C, Epstein-Barr, HIV, influenza, and SARS-associated coronavirus (
 <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Cinatl et al., 2003</xref>). Glycyrrhizin may inhibit SARS-associated coronavirus replication, adsorption and penetration (
 <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Anagha et al., 2014</xref>), which are early steps in cycles of viral replication, with better efficiency observed when administered during and after the adsorption period. Glycyrrhizin inhibits SARS-associated coronavirus replication 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, while its aglycone metabolite glycyrrhetinic acid inhibits inflammatory responses that occur as a consequence of viral infection (
