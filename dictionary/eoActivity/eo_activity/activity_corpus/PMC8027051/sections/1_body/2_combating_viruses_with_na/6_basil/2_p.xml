<p>The essential oil of basil leaves contains the powerful anti-viral compound eugenol (
 <xref rid="ref64" ref-type="bibr">Raja et al., 2015</xref>), which may be effective against herpes, hepatitis B, and influenza A viruses. Eugenol can hinder expression of autophagic genes by inhibiting activation of Janus kinase 1, extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2, and IκB kinase (IKK)/NF-κB pathways. It is also able to prevent the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8), which are induced by influenza through inhibiting the IKK/NF-κB pathway (
