<p>Since SARS-CoV is similar to the novel nCoV-19, food crops and plants possessing antiviral activity may be explored as potential therapeutics. 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> summarizes the notable foods/plants with bioactive components, viruses that they have been used to treat and their mechanisms of action. Many of these plants/foods possess antiviral activities against multiple viruses; the majority inhibit viruses at the point of viral replication, whereas others inhibit adsorption of viral particles into host cells, thereby preventing viral entry. These antiviral foods/plants possess active components that attack viruses at different points or stages. For example, turmeric contains the active component curcumin which exhibits antiviral activity against viruses including herpes simplex virus, HIV, hepatitis virus, and respiratory syncytial virus. The positive effect of curcumin in turmeric arises from its ability to inhibit the viral growth and replication, making it a contender for antiviral drugs (

These foods/plants work in a cycle for effective antiviral action, unlike orthodox antivirals which are specific against a specific antiviral component. Several plants/foods show antiviral effects, including oregano, fennel, lemon balm, and peppermint. We discuss the effects of common and cheap plants/foods with antiviral activity that are found in homes around the world, including
