 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> is a rich source of mineral Zn, making the plant an effective local and inexpensive solution for fighting Zn deficiencies (
 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Gopalakrishnan et al., 2016</xref>). The Zn content of 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> leaves ranges from 31.03 mg/kg to 32.90±0.85 mg/kg. These values are similar to the range reported by Barminas et al. (1998) to be the daily requirement of dietary Zn (25.5∼31.03 mg of Zn/kg). Sufficient dietary Zn intake may be necessary for the synthesis of DNA and RNA, insulin, and function and/or structure of several enzymes (

A previous study reported that Zn homeostasis is critical to protect against invading pathogens and overreactive immune systems causing autoimmune diseases (
