 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> has been exploited as a major antiretroviral molecule due to its immunomodulatory activity (
 <xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">Nworu et al., 2013</xref>), and antiviral activities against HIV, human cytomegalovirus, and polioviruses. A recent molecular docking study reported that some flavonoids and anthraquinones in 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> may inhibit some proteins in SARS-CoV2, thus preventing its replication (
 <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">Hamza et al., 2020</xref>). In a study of COVID-19 patients, capsules of 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> leaf extracts and other plants demonstrated promising therapeutic results that require further investigations (

 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> could be important for COVID-19 treatment, in addition to its other immunomodulatory and antiviral constituents (
