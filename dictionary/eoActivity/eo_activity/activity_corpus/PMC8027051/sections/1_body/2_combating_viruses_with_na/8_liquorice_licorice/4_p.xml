<p>The active metabolite glycyrrhetinic acid present in 
 <italic>G. glabra</italic> inhibits H-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, allowing cortisol to access mineralocorticoid receptors in aldosterone-specific peripheral tissues to result in high levels of aldosterone in these organs. High levels of aldosterone downregulates ACE2, decreasing the number of entry points for SARS-CoV2 (

Although downregulation of ACE2 could negatively impact the cells as ACE2 protects some tissues (e.g., lungs), glycyrrhetinic acid exhibits immunomodulatory activity to help reduce inflammation in tissues including the lungs and heart. Glycyrrhetinic acid antagonises toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) dependent mechanisms, thus reducing TLR4 expression in lungs and hearts of endotoxin receptor models of inflammation. This reduces release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β (

 <italic>in vivo</italic> study also showed that administration of glycyrrhizin can reduce expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-33 in the serum, bronchoalveolar fluid, and lung tissues of mice with lipopolysaccharide-induced lung injury (
