<p>Ajoene, one of the organosulphur compounds in garlic, may inhibit HIV via inhibiting integrin-dependent processes, thereby blocking viral adhesion to host cells (

 <xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">Mousa, 2017</xref>), thereby minimizing viral infectivity. Quercetin interacts with haemagglutinin proteins, glycoproteins which helps viruses attach and fuse with host cells, thereby inhibiting entry of viruses into host cells. Quercetin is also able to increase zinc (Zn) uptake, a mineral which inhibits the activity of RNA polymerase, thereby preventing viral replication (Sreenivasulu et al., 2020). In addition, quercetin inhibits translation of hepatitis C (
