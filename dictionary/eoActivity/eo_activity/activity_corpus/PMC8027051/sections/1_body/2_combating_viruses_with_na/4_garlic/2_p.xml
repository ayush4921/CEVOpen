<p>The anti-viral action of garlic is credited to its flavonoids (quercetin) and organosulphur compounds (allicin, diallyl, trisulfide, and ajoene) (
 <xref rid="ref73" ref-type="bibr">Sharma, 2019</xref>). Allicin is the main chemical present in garlic, is responsible for its flavour, and possess broad antimicrobial activity both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> (
 <xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">Mehrbod et al., 2009</xref>). The significant anti-microbial activity of allicin is a consequence of a chemical reaction between allicin and thiol groups of various enzymes necessary for microorganism surveillance (
 <xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">Mehrbod et al., 2009</xref>). Allicin-containing supplements have been shown to prevent assaults of basic cold infection (

 <italic>in vitro</italic> study showed that garlic extracts can inhibit replication of influenza viruses due to the presence of allicin, which inhibits viral RNA polymerase via interacting with thiol groups of RNA polymerases (

 <xref rid="ref73" ref-type="bibr">Sharma, 2019</xref>). For example, allicin may inhibit release of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 and TNF-α in cells infected with reticuloendotheliosis virus (
 <xref rid="ref85" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2017</xref>) by downregulating expression of nuclear factor (NF)-κB and inhibiting expression of NF-κB-mediated inflammatory genes (
