<p>The mechanism of glycyrrhizinâ€™s anti-viral activity is unclear. An 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> study showed that glycyrrhizin is able to inhibit viral adsorption, penetration and replication by inducing nitrous oxide synthase in Vero cells (

Studies have shown high expression of ACE2 and type 2 transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) in upper and lower respiratory tracts, which support viral spread in human hosts and between individuals. As SARS-CoV primarily targets nasal goblet secretory cells, type II pneumocytes, and ileal absorptive enterocytes, and uses ACE2 as an entry point, reducing expressing of ACE2 in these cells may help combat the virus (

Glycyrrhizin can act by reducing the expression TMPRSS2, which is needed in viral adsorption and penetration, thus inhibiting virus uptake. Glycyrrhizin can also activate plasma aldosterone mineralocorticoid receptors, which protect organs from binding to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 via reducing ACE2 expression (
