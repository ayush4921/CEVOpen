<p>ACE2 is highly expressed in lung epithelial cells, therefore there is a high probability that those cells will be the area of first attack upon infection. Three main components of innate immunity in the airways (dendritic cells, alveolar space epithelial cells, and alveolar macrophages) help to combat the virus before adaptive immunity can kick-off. Furthermore, during infection many cytokines are produced to help fight off the virus. T-cells help to mediate responses as antigen presentation by dendritic cells and macrophages help initiate responses. Immunological assays have shown that infection with SARS-CoV2 produces corresponding increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-Î± (
