<p>The virus spread rapidly, traversing countries and continents, and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11th March 2020 following infection of over 3 million people and after causing 200,000 deaths (

SARS-CoV2 infects all groups of people, with higher fatality rates reported for people with comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, Parkinsonâ€™s disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease and cancer (

SARS-CoV2 (nCoV-19) is very similar in structure and feature to other b-coronaviruses, containing crown-like proteins referred to as spike proteins (S-proteins). S-proteins, envelope proteins (E-proteins), and membrane proteins (M-proteins) are the three structural proteins that make up the lipid envelope cloaking the entire viral structure, while the helix-like structural protein nucleocapsid contains the viral genome (
 <xref rid="ref92" ref-type="bibr">Yesudhas et al., 2020</xref>). S-proteins comprise of 2 functional units: S1 and S2. S1 is responsible for binding of the virus to host cell receptors, whereas S2 is responsible for fusion of viral membranes to host receptor membranes. These two processes are referred to as viral attachment, which is the first phase of viral infection. SARS-CoV2 binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on host cells (
