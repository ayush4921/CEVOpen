<p>The bio-waste obtained from fruit processing has a high potential to be exploited as an innovative and competitive source of bioactive compounds, with potential applications in the food and nutraceutical industry and other sectors. These applications withstand a highly promising way of adding value to industrial bio-residues, for instance by reducing microbiological contamination and environmental impact, and minimizing costs to the manufacturing units. Despite extensive research on bio-waste, the discovery of new compounds is still expected, once preliminary studies point to promising antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial activities. However, the deep characterization of these residues must be carried out to obtain safe and reproducible products. For example, future studies on the physiological effects of apple pomace should emphasize the material’s chemical characterization. This would facilitate the correlation of the biological activities with the pomace constituents and the material’s standardization when intended for therapeutic use. Simultaneously, different extraction methodologies must be compared to optimize the yield and quality of the bioactive or functional compounds present in the bio-residue/by-product. Moreover, despite the lack of toxicity, it should be considered that the crops are heavily sprayed with pesticides, requiring the residues to be subjected to complete toxicological analysis before being processed to extract valuable compounds.</p>
