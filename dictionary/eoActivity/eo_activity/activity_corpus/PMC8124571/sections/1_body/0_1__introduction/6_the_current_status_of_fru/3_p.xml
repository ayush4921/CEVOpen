<p>A significant part of apple production is processed and converted into juice or cider. The extraction of apple juice generates a solid residue, 
 <italic>apple pomace</italic>, which is the main bio-residue obtained by crushing and pressing apples during the juice-making process and represents around 30% of the original fruits. This apple industry bio-residue consists basically of 94.1% of peels and 4.1% of seeds (data on a wet weight basis) [

 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-02624" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Therefore, this industrial activity generates large quantities of underused bio-residues, which can be expensive and complex to remove. Thus, adding value to these materials might produce economic benefits, while reducing the huge volume of bio-residues demanding suitable disposal strategies [
