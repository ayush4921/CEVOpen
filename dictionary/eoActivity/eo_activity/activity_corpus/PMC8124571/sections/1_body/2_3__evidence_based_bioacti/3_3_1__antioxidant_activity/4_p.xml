<p>It is known that phenolic compounds (such as those present in apple pomace) can inhibit ROS; that is, they interrupt the cascade of free radical reactions in lipid peroxidation, in addition to other antioxidant effects depending on their structure [
 <xref rid="B115-molecules-26-02624" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. Apple pomace, including seeds, is an excellent source of natural antioxidants, such as catechins, procyanidins, caffeic acid, phloridzin, phloretin glycosides, quercetin glycosides, and chlorogenic acid, among others. In recent times, due to the increasing interest in new natural sources of antioxidant compounds, apple pomace has been researched as a promising source of bioactive polyphenols [
