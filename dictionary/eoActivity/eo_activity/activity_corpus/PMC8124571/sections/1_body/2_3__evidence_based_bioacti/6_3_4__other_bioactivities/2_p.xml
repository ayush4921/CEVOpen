<p>Despite the existence of studies reporting a negative effect on serum total and HDL cholesterol level after apple pomace-based formulations intake [
 <xref rid="B159-molecules-26-02624" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>], the most evident effect mediated by apple pomace based products consumption seems to be actually on cholesterol and triglyceride homeostasis [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-02624" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. These positive effects are mainly associated with the soluble dietary fiber content of the pomace [

 <xref rid="B161-molecules-26-02624" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>]. The mechanism of action may be through the increase of cholesterol excretion and inhibition of gastrointestinal reabsorption of primary bile acids [
 <xref rid="B162-molecules-26-02624" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>]. This promotes cholesterol uptake, synthesis, and turnover in the liver, leading to decreased cholesterol serum levels [

 <xref rid="B163-molecules-26-02624" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>]. Growing evidence also indicates that the apple pomace polyphenols contribute to these positive effects [
 <xref rid="B80-molecules-26-02624" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. The combination of apple pectin and a polyphenol-rich apple concentrate significantly decreased plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels, as well as intestinal cholesterol absorption [
