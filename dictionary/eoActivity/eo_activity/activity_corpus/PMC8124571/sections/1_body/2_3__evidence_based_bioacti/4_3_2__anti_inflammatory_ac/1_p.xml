<p>Inflammation is a biological response to various stimuli, including pathogens, harmful mechanical and chemical agents, and autoimmune reactions. It is the primary process by which the body repairs tissue damage and defends itself from stimuli, characterized by signs and symptoms, such as redness, swelling, heat, and pain [

Some classes of drugs (e.g., corticosteroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) used to treat inflammatory disorders can cause several adverse effects in addition to being expensive. Since antiquity, many people who suffer from inflammation have been treated with phytochemicals. This fact is evident from the discovery of acetylsalicylic acid. Thus, natural products offer great hope in the identification of bioactive compounds and their development in drugs for the treatment of inflammatory diseases [

Studies on the anti-inflammatory effects of various triterpenoids originating from natural products and chemical synthesis describe triterpenoids as powerful active agents acquired from natural products and excellent portions of synthesized compounds [
