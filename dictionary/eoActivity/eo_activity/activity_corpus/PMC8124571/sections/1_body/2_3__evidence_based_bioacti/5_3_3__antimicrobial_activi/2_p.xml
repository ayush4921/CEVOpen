<p>In addition to their antioxidant activity, phenolic compounds might also be valuable for their antimicrobial properties, resulting mainly from their mechanism of action on cell membranes and their ability to bind to the lipid bilayer of the bacterial plasma membrane [

 <xref rid="B140-molecules-26-02624" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. In fact, phenolic compounds integrate the plant defence system against microbial pathogens, such as fungi, bacteria, and viruses [
 <xref rid="B141-molecules-26-02624" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>], making them potentially useful to fight the bacterial resistance problem [

 <xref rid="B144-molecules-26-02624" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. Phenolic compounds can also inhibit the growth of microorganisms, such as

 <xref rid="B150-molecules-26-02624" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>]. For example, phenolic compounds in cooked ground walnut showed high antioxidant activities during refrigerated storage [
 <xref rid="B151-molecules-26-02624" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>]; phenolics in clove essential oil can enhance the stability of cake and other lipid foods for storage [
 <xref rid="B152-molecules-26-02624" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]; and a phenolic compound (rosmarinic acid) was used as a potential enhancer of functional properties in cupcakes [
