<p>Terpenoids are the most significant and widespread class of plant secondary metabolites synthesized from isopentenyl pyrophosphate oligomers [
 <xref rid="B88-molecules-26-02624" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>], being composed of different isoprene units (C5H8) that may undergo chemical rearrangement [

 <xref rid="B90-molecules-26-02624" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. The production of isoprene seems to be related to the mechanism that plants use to combat thermal and oxidative stress. Compounds derived from isoprene often undergo additional chemical modifications, such as oxidation or rearrangement of carbon structures. Triterpenoids are a group of compounds with 6 rearranged isoprene units (C30) with several beneficial biological activities and have, therefore, attracted research attention [

 <xref rid="B92-molecules-26-02624" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Regarding their application in food products, pentacyclic triterpenoids, particularly those with lupane, ursane, or oleanane structures, display several pharmacological activities, not to mention the fact of being devoid of prominent toxicity [
