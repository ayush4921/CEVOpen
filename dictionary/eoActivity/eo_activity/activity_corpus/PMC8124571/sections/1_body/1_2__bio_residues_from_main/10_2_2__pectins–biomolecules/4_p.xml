<p>Among the health-promoting properties, the immunomodulatory activity of polysaccharides has been specified [
 <xref rid="B84-molecules-26-02624" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. More and more polysaccharides isolated from medicinal plants are reported for their potent immunomodulating activities [

 <xref rid="B85-molecules-26-02624" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Acidic heteropolysaccharides could mediate the activity of certain immunological factors. Important factors from innate immunity are the complement system, NK-cells, phagocytes (macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells), and their metabolites (monokines) and mediator cells (mast cells, basophils, eosinophils, and thrombocytes), producing pro-inflammatory molecules [

Immunostimulating polysaccharides modulate the intestinal immune system, which has been known to direct not only defensive but also regulatory functions of both mucosal and systemic immune systems through lymphocyte migration depending on homing receptor pattern [
