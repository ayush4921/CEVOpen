<p>Polyphenols are an important group of secondary metabolites widely distributed in the plant kingdom [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-26-02624" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Plants produce phenolic structures, mostly flavonoids and tannins, phenolic acids, lignans, and stilbenes as a defense mechanism against UV-light, parasites, other pathogens, and herbivores. Some of these molecules are pigments, attracting pollinators and thus contributing to plant seedsâ€™ dispersion [
