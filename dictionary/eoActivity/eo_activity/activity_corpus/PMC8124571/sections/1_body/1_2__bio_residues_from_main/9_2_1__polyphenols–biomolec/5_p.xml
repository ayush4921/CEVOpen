<p>The profile of total flavanone of sweet and bitter oranges investigated by Farag et al. contained hesperidin (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-02624-f009">Figure 9</xref>E) (hesperetin-7-neohesperidoside) for bitter oranges. A second class of citrus flavonoids, polymethoxy flavones (PMF), which are considered to be more biologically active than flavanones, although less abundant, have also been identified [

 <xref rid="B65-molecules-26-02624" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Likewise, it has been reported that citrus peel contains more polymethoxylated flavonoids than other parts of edible fruits [
 <xref rid="B66-molecules-26-02624" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Another study reported flavonoids as the most discriminating phytochemicals among citrus fruits, including orange, analyzed using hierarchical cluster analysis [
