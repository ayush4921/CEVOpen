<p>Orange essential oils have several applications in the pharmaceutical and food industries. D-limonene is an oily fraction and is considered one of the purest sources of monocyclic terpene [

 <xref rid="B169-molecules-26-02624" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>]. The orange residue (solid and liquid) can be used to extract essential oils, while the solid residue, remaining after the extraction of the essential oil, can be reused to obtain cellulolytic fibers that are used as a support for semi-solid fermentation [
