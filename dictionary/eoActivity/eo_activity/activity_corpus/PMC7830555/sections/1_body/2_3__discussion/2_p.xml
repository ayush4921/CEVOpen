<p>TTO is an essential oil that has been used as a medicine since the beginning of the 20th century, when the Bundjalung aborigines of the northern coastal area of New South Wales (Australia) extracted TTO from the dried leaves of the 
 <italic>M. alternifolia</italic> plant and used it for the treatment of superficial wounds. TTO is widely used in Australia, Europe, and North America for the treatment of 
 <italic>tinea pedis</italic> and onychomycosis, mainly caused by 
 <italic>T. rubrum</italic> and 
 <italic>T. mentagrophytes</italic> in humans, and the treatment of dermatophytosis in horses caused by 
 <italic>T. equinum</italic> [

 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic>. 
 <italic>T. rubrum</italic> is the main causative agent of almost all 
 <italic>tinea</italic> infections worldwide, with the exception of 
 <italic>tinea capitis</italic>, and it is likely to remain the dominant dermatophyte globally for the near future [
