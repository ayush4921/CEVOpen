<p>Hence, the aim of this study was to assess for the first time whether TTO in association with ITZ or KTZ improves the antifungal activity of these azoles against 
 <italic>T. rubrum.</italic> In this perspective, our findings highlight the synergistic interaction of TTO with ITZ or KTZ against a 
 <italic>T. rubrum</italic> clinical strain. TTO also reduced the MIC of ITZ and KTZ up to 8-fold (from 0.5 to 0.06 µg/mL and 0.25 to 0.03 µg/mL, respectively). Moreover, another remarkable result is that the TTO MIC decreased in combination with azoles (0.135/0.27 mg/mL vs. 1.08 mg/mL) up to 8- and 4-fold (
