<p>The results obtained have demonstrated both the effects of TTO on 
 <italic>T. rubrum</italic> and the synergism when it was used in combination with azoles. Therefore, combining itraconazole or ketoconazole with TTO may reduce the minimum effective dose of azole required and thus minimize the side effects for the treatment of infections caused by 
 <italic>Trichophyton</italic> species.
