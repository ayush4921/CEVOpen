<p>Dermatophytoses have an unlikely spontaneous regression, and expensive, complex, and long-term therapy is often required. Antifungal drugs, such as azoles and terbinafine, play an important role in controlling these fungal infections but can have serious drawbacks, such as toxicity, fungistatic activity, and a limited spectrum of action or resistance [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-26-00461" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In fact, dermatophytes with low sensitivity to antifungal drugs have occurred in many countries worldwide (i.e., Switzerland, Denmark, and India) [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-26-00461" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Treatment of fungal infections caused by the drug-resistant fungi may require higher treatment doses. If azoles are used in higher doses in monotherapy, they can lead to adverse effects such as hepatotoxicity [

 <italic>T. rubrum</italic> isolates sometimes showed a low susceptibility to azole compounds: Monod et al. [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-26-00461" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] showed that a strain from a male with 
 <italic>tinea pedis</italic> was not responsive to standard therapy with terbinafine and ITZ. The great importance of natural products in the development of new therapeutic tools is becoming increasingly evident. In this respect, medicinal plants and their derivatives, such as essential oils, are important in phytotherapy, and for pharmacological research and drug development [
