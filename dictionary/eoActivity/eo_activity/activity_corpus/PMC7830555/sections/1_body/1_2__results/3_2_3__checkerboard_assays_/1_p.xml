<p>In order to determine what combination of TTO with azoles would be most effective, the checkerboard microtiter test was performed. The SL 171/13 strain was chosen because it demonstrated high sensitivity to TTO and both azoles. The combinations of TTO with the antifungal agents are reported in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00461-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. By checkerboard testing, the binary associations of TTO with ITZ or KTZ were found to be synergistic against 
 <italic>T. rubrum</italic> with FICI values of 0.245 and 0.37 (FICI &lt; 0.5), respectively.
