<p>The preferred treatment for cutaneous infections caused by 
 <italic>Trichophyton</italic> spp. are imidazoles, such as ketoconazole (KTZ), and triazoles, such as itraconazole (ITZ), often resulting in a complete clearance of the lesions. However, inappropriate prescribing, and the increased use of systemic antifungal agents in recent years are the main factors leading to the emergence of resistance to antifungal drugs (i.e., azoles) [

 <italic>T. rubrum</italic> can develop resistance to azoles after prolonged exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of these drugs leading to therapeutic failures and to the persistence and chronicity of the infections. Furthermore, complications like bacterial superinfections can occur [
