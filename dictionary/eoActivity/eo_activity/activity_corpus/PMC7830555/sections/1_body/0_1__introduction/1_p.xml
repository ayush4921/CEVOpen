<p>Dermatophytes are the most common fungal agents leading to superficial skin infections. During the last century, their spread changed under the influence of several elements, such as socioeconomic factors, practices bound to life-style, increasing travel, and migration from southern to northern countries and vice versa [

 <italic>Trichophyton rubrum</italic>, frequently causing 
 <italic>tinea pedis</italic>, 
 <italic>tinea unguium</italic>, and 
 <italic>tinea corporis</italic>, has increased steadily over this period and became the main agent isolated worldwide [

 <italic>T. rubrum</italic> has represented the most widespread dermatophyte in Central and North Europe with a prevalence accounting for about 70% of dermatophytosis. This species is often the key etiological agent of chronic infections with a slow progression, suggesting that the fungus has adapted to the human host [
