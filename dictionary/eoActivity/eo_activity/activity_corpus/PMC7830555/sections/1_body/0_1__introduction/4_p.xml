<p>These problems have stimulated the search for therapeutic alternatives, including natural compounds such as essential oils, which have been increasingly used in recent years for their biological and antimicrobial activities. Furthermore, a recent focus of research on essential oils is to investigate their potential use in combination with conventional antimicrobial drugs [

In fact, essential oils are one of the most evident promising sources for pharmacological research and the development of new natural antimicrobial agents against many microbial pathogens such as bacteria, yeasts, filamentous fungi, including dermatophytes, and viruses [

Because of its lipophilic nature, which facilitates skin penetration, it is used as a local formulation for dermatological disorders [
