<p>The results of the checkerboard assays were represented graphically by isobolograms, as previously described [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-26-00461" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-26-00461" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. FIC values along the growth-no growth interface were calculated and reported by plotting FIC values of drug along the ordinate, and FIC values of TTO along the abscissa. The straight line that joins the intercept points is the line of additivity (FICI = 1). Below this line, we find the area of additive (0.5 &lt; FICI ≤ 1) and synergistic (FICI ≤ 0.5) effects, respectively. FIC index values above of the straight line were interpreted as corresponding to indifferent (1 &lt; FICI &lt; 4) or antagonistic (FICI &gt; 4) interactions [
