<p>For the experimental assays, 100% essential oil and the major components were dissolved 1:10 in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma-Aldrich) and diluted in a RPMI-1640 medium with L-glutamine plus 0.2% glucose and without sodium bicarbonate (Sigma-Aldrich, Rome, Italy), as previously described [
