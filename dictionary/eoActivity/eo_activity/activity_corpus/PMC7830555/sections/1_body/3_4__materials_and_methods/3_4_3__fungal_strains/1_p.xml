<p>Four clinical isolates of 
 <italic>T. rubrum</italic> isolated from 
 <italic>tinea pedis</italic> (SL 171/13, SL 160/13) and 
 <italic>tinea corporis</italic> (SL 164/13, SL 136/13), kindly provided by Prof. Ornella Cervetti and Dr. Michele Panzone (Medical Sciences Department, University of Turin, Turin, Italy), were used. Strains were subcultured on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA; Oxoid S.p.A., Milan, Italy) at 30 °C. After a week, aerial mycelium was collected with sterile swabs, transferred in a flask containing Nutrient Broth (NB; Oxoid S.p.A., Milan, Italy), incubated at 35 °C and swirled once each day to prevent conidiation by keeping the culture submerged. From these 3–5-day-old cultures, mycelium was fragmented using a Tissue Grinder Teflon
 <sup>®</sup> Pestle (Thomas
 <sup>®</sup> Scientific, Swedesboro, NJ, USA) and diluted in a RPMI 1640 (Sigma-Aldrich) broth medium to yield a final inoculum of 1.5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cfu/mL [
