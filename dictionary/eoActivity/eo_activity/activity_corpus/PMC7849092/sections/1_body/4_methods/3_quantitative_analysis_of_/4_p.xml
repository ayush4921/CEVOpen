<p id="Par86">Fat extraction: The hydrolyzed sample was supplemented with 10 mL 95% ethanol and mixed. The hydrolysate in the flask was then transferred to the separation funnel. Then, the flask and stopper were washed with 50 mL of the ethyl ether petroleum ether mixture. Next, the rinse solution was incorporated into the separation funnel, capped, shaken for 5 min, and set aside for 10 min. Subsequently, the extraction solution was collected into a 250-mL flask. The hydrolysate was extracted 3 times as described in the previous steps. Finally, the separation funnel was flushed with the petroleum ether with ether mixture (volume ratio 1:1), and the flushing fluid was collected into a constant weight flash that would be boiled in a water bath and dried at 100 °C for 2 h.</p>
