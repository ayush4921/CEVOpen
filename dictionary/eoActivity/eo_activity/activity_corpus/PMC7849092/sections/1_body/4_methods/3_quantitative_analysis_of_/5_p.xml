<p id="Par87">Fatty acid esterification: The 2 mL of 2% NaOH methanol solution was added to the fat extract and heated at 80 °C for 30 min. Then, 3 mL 14% trifluoro (methanol) boron solution was added and heated at 80 °C for 30 min. Next, the mixture was cooled to room temperature and placed in a centrifuge tube, and 1 mL n-hexane was added. It was extracted by shock for 2 min and then left for 1 h and stratified. One hundred microliters of the supernatant was increased to 1 mL with n-hexane and filtered with a 0.45-μm organic-phase filter into a 2-mL chromatographic sample bottle.</p>
