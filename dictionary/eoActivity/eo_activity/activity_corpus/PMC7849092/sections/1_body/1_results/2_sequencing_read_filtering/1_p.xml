<p id="Par56">Nine cDNA libraries containing three biological repeats were created from three stages of developing herbaceous peony ‘Hangshao’ seeds (the early, middle and late stages of seed development, that is 30, 60, and 90 DAF, respectively) collected from the same strain and sequenced using the Illumina high-throughput sequencing platform, to explore the molecular mechanism of fatty acid biosynthesis and oil accumulation. A total of 100.07 G paired-end raw reads were produced by transcriptome sequencing. After removing low-quality, adapter-contaminated and high-content unknown base (N) reads, the percentage of clean reads for nine samples was more than 82% (Additional file
