<p id="Par58">Based on the NR database function annotation result, the ratio of different species unigene annotation was calculated, and the distribution map was drawn (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>:Figure S2A). The unigenes of herbaceous peony ‘Hangshao’ seeds were matched to species such as 
 <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> (32.79%), 
 <italic>Nelumbo nucifera</italic> (5.84%), 
 <italic>Theobroma cacao</italic> (5.45%) and 
 <italic>Jatropha curcas</italic> (3.66%). In addition, 51,612 (34.37%) unigenes were annotated with 25 KOG terms (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S2B). Interestingly, 1868 unigenes were annotated in the ‘Lipid transport and metabolism’ category. Moreover, 29,413 (19.59%) unigenes were annotated with 55 GO terms, including 24 terms related to biological processes, 17 terms related to cellular component and 14 terms related to molecular functions (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>:Figure S2C). To further understand the biological functions and interactions of genes, they were also classified into metabolic pathways using KEGG. A total of 49,630 (33.05%) unigenes were assigned to 21 subcategories divided into six categories, including cellular processes, environmental information processing, genetic information processing, human diseases, metabolism and organismal systems (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>:Figure S2D). Among the KEGG pathways, the top three subcategories were ‘global and overview maps’ (12,390 unigenes), metabolism’ (4905 unigenes) and ‘translation’ (4321 unigenes). In contrast, 1766 unigenes were annotated to ‘lipid metabolism’, which will help us understand the fatty acid and oil accumulation in herbaceous peony seeds.
