<p id="Par69">TAG is stored as an oil body (OB), which is the main lipid-storage organelle in plant cells. Additionally, OB contains the hydrophobic core of TAG, which is surrounded by a monolayer of phospholipids and unique proteins called oleosin (OLE), caleosin (CLO) and steroleosin (STE), which play important roles in maintaining the stability of OB, regulating the size of OB, and controlling the amount of OB. We identified 6 and 4 DEGs as 
 <italic>OLE</italic> and 
 <italic>CLO</italic>, respectively. We also found that the expression levels of most of those DEGs showed a rising trend.
