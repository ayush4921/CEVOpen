<p id="Par65">For fatty acid biosynthesis, the critical steps and key enzymes are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>. First, acetyl-CoA conversion to malonyl-CoA is catalyzed by the enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase), which consists of four subunits: biotin carboxylase (BC), carboxyl transferase subunit alpha (α-CT), carboxyl transferase subunit beta (β-CT) and biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP). We identified 15 DEGs encoding ACCase subunits, including 5 
 <italic>BC</italic>, 3 
 <italic>α-CT</italic> and 7 
 <italic>BCCP</italic>. Then, malonyl-CoA was converted to malonyl-ACP, the primary substrate for a subsequent cycle of condensation reactions, by malonyl-CoA ACP transacylase (MCAT). Only 1 DEG was identified as 
 <italic>MCAT</italic>. Subsequently, malonyl-ACP combined with acetyl-CoA were condensed to β-ketobutyryl-ACP by 3-oxoacyl-ACP synthase III (KASIII), and only 1 DEG for 
 <italic>KASIII</italic> was identified. Then, β-ketobutyryl-ACP was converted to β-hedroxybutyryl-ACP via reduction by 3-oxoacyl-ACP reductase (KAR), and 8 DEGs were identified as 
 <italic>KAR</italic>. Next, the β-hedroxybutyryl-ACP was dehydrated by 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase (HAD) to generate 
 <italic>trans</italic>-Δ
 <sup>2</sup>-butenoyl-ACP, and 4 DEGs were identified as 
 <italic>HAD</italic>. The 
 <italic>trans</italic>-Δ
 <sup>2</sup>-butenoyl-ACP was reduced to butyryl-ACP (C4:0-ACP) by enoyl-ACP reductase I (EAR), and 3 unigenes were identified as 
 <italic>EAR</italic>. Subsequently, after 6 cycles for a series of condensation, reduction, dehydration and reduction reactions by 3-oxoacyl-ACP synthase II (KASII), KAR, HAD and EAR, C4:0-ACP was transformed to palmitoyl-ACP (C16:0-ACP). Moreover, after 7 cycles of those reactions, C4:0-ACP was transformed to stearoyl-ACP (C18:0-ACP). We identified 4 DEGs as 
 <italic>KASII</italic>. Under the effect of fatty acyl-ACP thioesterase B (FATB) and fatty acyl-ACP thioesterase A (FATA), C16:0-ACP and C18:0-ACP were transformed to palmitic acid (C16:0, PA) and stearic acid (C18:0, SA), respectively. Two DEGs were identified as 
 <italic>FATB</italic>, but only 1 DEG was identified as 
 <italic>FATA</italic>.
