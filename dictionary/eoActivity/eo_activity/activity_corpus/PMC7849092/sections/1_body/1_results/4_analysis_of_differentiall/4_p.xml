<p id="Par62">In addition, 1480 DEGs were obtained from the intersection analysis of the three groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a), and these 1480 DEGs were annotated to 17 biological processes, 14 cellular components and 12 molecular functions in the GO database (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). In biological process, the largest category was ‘metabolic process’, followed by ‘cellular process’ and ‘single-organism process’. In cellular component, the largest category was ‘membrane’, followed by ‘cell’ and ‘cell part’. In molecular function, the two largest categories were ‘catalytic activity’ and ‘binding’. Moreover, the 1480 DEGs were annotated to 19 KEGG pathways (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). The largest category was ‘global and overview maps’, followed by ‘carbohydrate metabolism’ and ‘lipid metabolism’.
