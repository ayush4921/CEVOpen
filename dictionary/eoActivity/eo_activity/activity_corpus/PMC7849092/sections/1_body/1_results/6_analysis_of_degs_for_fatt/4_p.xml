<p id="Par67">The biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids occurs via two pathways, the plastid pathway and endoplasmic reticulum pathway, beginning with C18:0-ACP. First, with dehydrogenation by stearoyl-ACP desaturase (SAD), C18:0-ACP is transformed to oleoyl-ACP (C18:1-ACP) in the plastid. Six DEGs were identified as 
 <italic>SAD</italic>. Then, some C18:1-ACP was dehydrogenized to linoleoyl-ACP (C18:2-ACP) by delta-12 desaturase in the plastid (FAD6). No DEGs were identified as 
 <italic>FAD6</italic>. Next, C18:2-ACP was dehydrogenized by Delta-15 desaturase in the plastid (FAD7/8) to form alpha-linolenoyl-ACP (C18:3-ACP). Two DEGs each were annotated to 
 <italic>FAD7</italic> and 
 <italic>FAD8</italic>. However, some C18:1-ACP was transformed to C18:1 by FATA, which was transformed to C18:1-CoA by LACS, and then C18:1-CoA was transformed in the endoplasmic reticulum. Subsequently, C18:1-CoA and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) were transformed to C18:1-PC by lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT). No DEGs were identified as 
 <italic>LPCAT</italic>. Next, C18:1-PC was dehydrogenized to C18:2-PC by delta-12 desaturase in the endoplasmic reticulum (FAD2), and C18:2-PC was dehydrogenized to C18:3-PC by delta-15 desaturase in the endoplasmic reticulum (FAD3). Nine and 5 DEGs were identified as 
 <italic>FAD2</italic> and 
 <italic>FAD3</italic>, respectively.
