<p id="Par60">The DEGs at different developmental stages were integrated and mapped into the GO database (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Table S3 and Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Figure S3). Overall, the number of DEGs annotated to the same GO term between the three different groups increased with the developmental stage. The DEGs in Group III were annotated to 23 biological processes, 17 cellular components and 14 molecular functions. In contrast, the DEGs in Group II were annotated to 21 biological processes (except for ‘biological adhesion’ and ‘locomotion’), 17 cellular components and 13 molecular functions (except for ‘metallochaperone activity’). Additionally, the DEGs in Group I were annotated to 21 biological processes (except for ‘biological adhesion’ and ‘rhythmic process’), 14 cellular components (except for ‘nucleoid’, ‘virion’ and ‘virion part’) and 12 molecular functions (except for ‘metallochaperone activity’ and ‘protein tag’).
