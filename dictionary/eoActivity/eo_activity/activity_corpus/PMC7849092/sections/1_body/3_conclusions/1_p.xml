<p id="Par79">GC-MS analysis revealed that ‘Hangshao’ seeds have five main fatty acids, including palmitic acid (PA), stearic acid (SA), oleic acid (OA), linoleic acid (LA) and α-linolenic acid (ALA). The total content of the five fatty acids first increased and then decreased, reaching a maximum at 75 DAF. Additionally, the ratio of the content of OA to ALA was close to 1:1. A total of 150,156 unigenes were obtained by transcriptome sequencing, with an average length of 1030 bp. There were 15,005 unigenes annotated in the seven functional databases, including NR, NT, GO, KOG, KEGG, Swiss-Prot and InterPro. Based on the KEGG database, there were 1766 unigenes annotated to lipid metabolism. We also screened out 503 DEGs in lipid metabolism, which were annotated to 111 enzymes. To further uncover the key genes associated with the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acid and oil accumulation, we identified 123 DEGs involved in fatty acid biosynthesis (39 DEGs), fatty acid elongation (33 DEGs), biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acid (24 DEGs), TAG assembly (17 DEGs) and lipid storage (10 DEGs). Furthermore, qRT-PCR was used to analyze the expression patterns of 16 related genes, including
