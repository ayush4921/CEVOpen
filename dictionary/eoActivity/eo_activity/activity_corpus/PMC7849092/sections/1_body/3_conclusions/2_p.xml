<p id="Par80">In conclusion, we present the first high-quality transcriptome sequence for herbaceous peony seeds. The sequences of genes related to unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis and oil accumulation were obtained based on large-scale transcriptome data, which will enable further metabolomic and gene functional studies. This species with rich PUFA content, accompanied by an omega-6/omega-3 ratio close to 1:1, was studied to form a more diversified set of PUFAs to eventually increase storage PUFA production and meet the needs of more humans worldwide for intake of an omega-6/omega-3 ratio close to 1:1.</p>
