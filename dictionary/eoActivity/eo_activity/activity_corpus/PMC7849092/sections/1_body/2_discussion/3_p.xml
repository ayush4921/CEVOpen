<p id="Par75">One of main objectives of this study was to identify potential unigenes involved in unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis and oil accumulation in developing seeds of herbaceous peony. However, oil accumulation mainly involves fatty acid biosynthesis (including fatty acid carbon chain elongation and desaturation), TAG assembly and lipid storage [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Overall, to produce a C16 or C18 fatty acid from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA, more than 30 enzymatic reactions are required, involving enzymes such as ACCase (including BC, BCCP, α-CT and β-CT), MCAT, KAS (including KASI, KASII and KASIII), KAR, HAD, EAR, and FAT (including FATA and FATB), among others [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. In this study, we screened out many relevant DEGs encoding the above enzymes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Most of them were downregulated DEGs such as 
 <italic>BCCP</italic>. Even though some of these DEGs were upregulated, their FPKM values were lower than 10, except for two DEGs that were annotated to 
 <italic>KAR</italic> (named CL2376.Contig1_All and CL2376.Contig2_All). Interestingly, only 1 unigene each was annotated to MCAT, KASIII and FATA, all of which were downregulated DEGs. MCAT is a key enzyme in the fatty acid synthesis pathway, and its expression level is closely related to lipid accumulation. At present, overexpression of the 
 <italic>MCAT</italic> gene in rape and other plants has a positive effect on promoting the accumulation of C16 and C18 fatty acids [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. KASIII is a key enzyme that initiates de novo fatty acid synthesis. At present, 
 <italic>KASIII</italic> has been cloned from plants such as sunflower [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] and jatropha [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Some studies have shown that KASIII can use other receptor substrates to generate different final products of fatty acid synthesis, which indicates that KASIII is one of the main factors determining the carbon chain structure of fatty acids [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. In addition, KASIII, as the initiator of de novo synthesis of fatty acid, plays a second role in determining the length of the carbon chain of fatty acids [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Some studies have suggested that the synthesis rate of fatty acid is affected by KASIII enzymatic activity, indicating that it may be one of the rate-limiting enzymes in the fatty acid synthesis pathway [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. In the present study, the FPKM value of the 
 <italic>KASIII</italic> gene in this transcriptome decreased with the development of seeds, but its expression by qRT-PCR was highest at 45 DAF (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>), which was consistent with the accumulation rate of fatty acid in herbaceous peony seeds. FATA is a type of acyl-ACP thioesterase (FAT). De novo synthesis of fatty acid was terminated by FAT, which hydrolyzes the thiol-lipid bond located between acyl and ACP to form fatty acids [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. The specificity of FAT largely determines the chain length and unsaturated degree of plant fatty acids in glycerolipid and TAG [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. According to the sequence alignment, FAT can be classified as FATA and FATB, which have different substrate specificities. However, FATA has the highest catalytic activity of C18:1
 <sup>Δ9</sup>-ACP [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. In this study, the FPKM value of 
 <italic>FATA</italic> in this transcriptome also decreased with the development of seeds; however, the tendency of 
 <italic>FATA</italic> expression by qRT-PCR was consistent with the total accumulation rate of OA, LA and ALA in herbaceous peony seeds.
