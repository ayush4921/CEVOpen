  <p>Proposed gene networks involved in unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis and oil accumulation in 
   <italic>Paeonia lactiflora</italic> ‘Hangshao’ seeds. The expression levels (represented by the Log
   <sub>2</sub> FPKM) of the possible candidates are highlighted by color scales (blue to red scale) in 
   <italic>Paeonia lactiflora</italic> ‘Hangshao’ seeds at different development stages (30, 60 and 90 DAF). BC: biotin carboxylase; BCCP: biotin carboxyl carrier protein; α-CT: carboxyl transferase subunit alpha; β-CT: carboxyl transferase subunit beta; MACT: malonyl-CoA-acyl carrier protein transacylase; KASIII: 3-oxoacyl-ACP synthase III; KAR: 3-oxoacyl-ACP reductase; HAD: 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase; EAR: enoyl-ACP reductase I; KASII: 3-oxoacyl-ACP synthase II; FATB: fatty acyl-ACP thioesterase B; FATA: fatty acyl-ACP thioesterase A; SAD: stearoyl-ACP desaturase; FAD: fatty acid desaturase; PCH: palmitoyl-CoA hydrolase; LACS: long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase; PC: phosphatidylcholine LPC: lysophosphatidylcholine; LPCAT: lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase; PLA2: phospholipase A2; KCS: 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase; KCR: very-long-chain 3-oxoacyl-CoA reductase; HCD: very-long-chain (3R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase; ECR: very-long-chain enoyl-CoA reductase; GPAT: glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase; LPAAT: 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase; PAP: phosphatide phosphatase; DGAT: diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase; PDAT: phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase; PDCT: phosphatidylcholine:diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase; OB: oil body; OLE: oleosin; CLO: caleosin. * represented DEGs in all three groups. This model was developed based on the transcriptome data obtained in this study and information from Li et al. [
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], Tian et al. [
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and Yang et al. [
