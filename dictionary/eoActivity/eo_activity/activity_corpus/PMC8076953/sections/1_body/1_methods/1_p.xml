<p>The databases employed for data collection are mainly from EBSCOHOST, Medline and Ovid, Scopus, Springer, and Google Scholar databases from 1985 to 2020. The keywords used during searching include allergic rhinitis OR pollinosis OR hay fever, AND medicinal plant OR single plant OR single herb OR phytotherapy. Studies included in this mechanistic review were 
 <italic>in vivo, in vitro</italic>, and clinical studies on medicinal plants that showed significant suppressive effect on AR. The sources of medicinal plants were verified, and only studies on single medicinal plant were considered. 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows a list of medicinal plants and phytochemicals which exhibited anti-allergic rhinitis effect 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies while 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> is a list of plants that have been investigated for anti-allergic rhinitis activity in clinical trials. Studies that were excluded from the searching and data extraction were polyherbal formulations, used as an adjunct therapy or as supplementation only and studies that were not using AR-induced model in animal studies or AR patients for its clinical studies. In addition, toxicological data on the medicinal plants that showed strong anti-allergic rhinitis effect were also gathered to discuss their safety levels for possible use in treating AR.
