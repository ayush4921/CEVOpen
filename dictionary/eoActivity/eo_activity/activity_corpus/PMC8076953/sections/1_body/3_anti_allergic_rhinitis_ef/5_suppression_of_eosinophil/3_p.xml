<p>There is an association between the levels of eosinophil and Th17. Both components have been investigated in an 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> study of 
 <italic>Piper nigrum</italic> L. on OVA-induced subject which has a significant increase in eosinophil level with 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001. Treatment with ethanol extract of 
 <italic>P. nigrum</italic> at a dose of 50 mg/kg showed a significant decrease (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) while at the doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), the extract showed a medium activity against eosinophil suppression compared with the OVA group (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Bui et al., 2019a</xref>). This study has also been conducted on the effect of dexamethasone in suppressing eosinophil levels with a significant decrease in eosinophil levels at 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 compared to OVA-group. The study emphasized the important key components of eosinophil which are very crucial in most allergic reactions including AR. Thus, suppression of eosinophil may result in the alleviation of AR symptoms.
