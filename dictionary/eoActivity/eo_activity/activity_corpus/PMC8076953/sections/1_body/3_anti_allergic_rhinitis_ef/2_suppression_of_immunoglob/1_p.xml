<p>IgE is identified as the key molecule that triggers type 1 hypersensitivity reactions such as atopic dermatitis and AR (

Production of IgE antibodies may be enhanced by the interleukins, particularly IL-4 and IL-3, produced subsequently after the activation of the Th2 cells. This will eventually increase the regulation of eosinophil functions and promote the growth of mast cells (

IgE is an important potential key component targeted at the early stage of hypersensitive reaction as it leads to the activation of other chemical or immunological cascades in later stages. These antibodies, in turn, attached to specific receptors on other resident cells by binding to high-affinity (cεRI) surface receptors on basophils, mast cells or CD23 on B lymphocytes and eosinophils (

However, it is extremely bioactive as it binds to high-affinity receptors on the surface of basophils and mast cells. The basophils and mast cells may be highly sensitive to allergens even when the concentration of IgE is very low in the circulation. IgE production and mast cell degranulation is the significant type I allergic responses which cause the subsequent release of histamine and other mediators in an allergic reaction. Following the early phase of allergic reactions, cytokines release including IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and TNF-α, enhances IgE synthesis. In contrast, IFN-γ, IFN-α and transforming factor (TGF)-β might also inhibit IgE production (
