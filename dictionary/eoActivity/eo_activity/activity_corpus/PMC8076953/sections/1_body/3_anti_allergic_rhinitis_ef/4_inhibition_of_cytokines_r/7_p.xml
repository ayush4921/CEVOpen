<p>Petasol butenoate complex, Ze339, a herbal extract from 
 <italic>Petasites hybridus</italic> (L.) G. Gaertn., B. Mey. and Schreb. leaves is known to be effective in treating AR. The use of this medicinal plant has led to decreased local production of IL-8 and LTB4 measured in nasal lining fluid and a faster recovery from nasal obstruction in allergic patients in a placebo-controlled double blind randomized clinical trial (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Dumitru et al., 2011</xref>). The study has been conducted in 18 subjects with AR to grass pollen has shown a significant decrease in IL-8 and LTB
 <sub>4</sub> expression compared to desloratadine (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.025 and 0.014, respectively). Petasin (
 <bold>7</bold>) is a racemic mixture consisting of the isoforms of isopetasin (
 <bold>7a</bold>) and neopetasin (
 <bold>7b</bold>). They have been found to be the active components of the extract of this medicinal plant in an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> study on human nasal epithelial cells (
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">Steiert et al., 2017</xref>). This study concluded that petasin decreased the PolyIC-induced IL-8 expression and neutrophil chemotaxis at the dose of 10 μg/ml with significant value of 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01. Thus, Ze339 and its constituents, isopetasin and neopetasin are potential candidates for the development of agents for the treatment of immune deviations associated with continuous cytokine-induced inflammation.
