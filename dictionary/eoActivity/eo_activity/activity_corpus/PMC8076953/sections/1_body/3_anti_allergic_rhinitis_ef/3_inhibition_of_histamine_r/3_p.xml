<p>Extract of 
 <italic>Wurfbainia villosa</italic> var. 
 <italic>xanthioides</italic> (Wall. ex Baker) Skornick. and A.D.Poulsen from Zingiberaceae family significantly inhibited systemic allergic reaction and histamine release (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Kim H.-G. et al., 2015</xref>). An 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> study showed significant differences in the reduction of histamine release (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) at the dose of 10–1000 mg/kg compared to 48/80-induced rat peritoneal mast cell (RPMC) histamine release. 
 <italic>W. villosa</italic> extract has shown several actions that were beneficial in alleviating the symptoms in immediate hypersensitivity reaction. The activity of 
 <italic>W. villosa</italic> in inhibiting histamine release was moderate since there was not so much of significant difference when a higher dose of its extract was used. Apart from its anti-allergic rhinitis effect, the ethyl acetate extract of 
 <italic>W. villosa</italic> modulated tumor growth factor-β (TGF-β) related signaling, primarily 
 <italic>via</italic> the Smad2/3 and Smad7 (gene chromosomes) signaling pathways, in bile duct ligation-induced liver fibrosis subject, suggesting that it has antifibrotic effects against cholestatic liver injury (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2019</xref>). Other mechanisms suggested that the ethyl acetate extract of 
 <italic>W. villosa</italic> regulated fibrogenic cytokines, especially TGF-β (
