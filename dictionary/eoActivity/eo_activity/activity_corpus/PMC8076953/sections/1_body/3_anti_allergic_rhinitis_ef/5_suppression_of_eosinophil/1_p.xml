<p>Eosinophils and mass cells are the key inflammatory cells in allergic inflammation. Eosinophil infiltration has been considered as the major attribute of AR mucosal inflammation as it is (

 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). In fact eosinophils infiltration is the best marker of allergic inflammation that results in severe inflammation and causes the most severe symptoms (

 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Gelardi et al., 2008</xref>). IgE production is a proinflammatory process driven by cytokines that act against allergensâ€™ exposure through the mucosal infiltration and actions of plasma cells, mast cells, and eosinophils (
