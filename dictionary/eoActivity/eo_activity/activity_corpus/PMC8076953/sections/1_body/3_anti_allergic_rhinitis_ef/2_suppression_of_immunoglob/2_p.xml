<p>Several cellular and animal studies have been performed to investigate the suppressive effect of medicinal plants on IgE in AR-induced model. The effect of Bupleurum chinense DC. extract on allergic inflammatory responses was conducted in ovalbumin (OVA)-induced AR mouse model by determining the anti-OVA specific IgE, IgG1 and IgG2a in the serum (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Bui et al., 2019c</xref>). Results showed that at doses of 100 and 200Â mg/kg of 
 <italic>B. chinense</italic>, there was a significant (&lt;0.05 and &lt;0.01, respectively) suppression of anti-OVA specific IgE in a dose-dependent pattern. The anti-OVA specific IgG1 in serum was also decreased in a dose-dependent manner which resulted in the inhibition of histamine release. This data indicated that oral administration of 
 <italic>B. chinense</italic> might ameliorate allergic inflammation responses in AR early phase as this particular action mediated by the IgE antibody is the crucial key component that initiates hypersensitivity reaction in AR.
