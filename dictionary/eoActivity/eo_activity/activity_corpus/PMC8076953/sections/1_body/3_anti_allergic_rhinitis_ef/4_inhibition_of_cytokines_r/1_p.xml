<p>Cytokines particularly cysteinyl-leukotrienes were released by mast cells activated by IgE-mediated mechanism in AR (
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">Pawankar and Ra, 1996</xref>). In the early phase of IgE-mediated allergic reaction, some types of cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13 will be released by activated T lymphocytes and will interact with B lymphocytes to induce the synthesis of allergen-specific IgE (

Some examples of cytokines such as IL-5 and granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-SCF) may help to overcome programmed cell death of eosinophils by keeping eosinophils alive for several days or even weeks (
