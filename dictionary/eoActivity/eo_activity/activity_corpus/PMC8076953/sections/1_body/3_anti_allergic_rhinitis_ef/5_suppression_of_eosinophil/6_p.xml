<p>Mangiferin 
 <bold>8</bold>) isolated from 
 <italic>Mangifera indica</italic> L. has showed a significant decrease in eosinophil level compared to the OVA group at 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 given at the dose of 5 and 20 mg/kg. The result showed a similar significant difference in eosinophil level in the animal models treated with 2.5 mg/kg of dexamethasone (

 <bold>8</bold>) at the dose of 20 mg/kg produced a better protective effect on inflammatory cell production compared to 5 mg/kg mangiferin (

 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">Piao et al., 2020</xref>). Mangiferin (
 <bold>8</bold>) may have the potential to be a better alternative to alleviate AR symptoms than conventional medicines with less side effects. However, the safety and efficacy of this compound may need further research.
