<p>There was a statistically significant reduction in mean nasal smear eosinophil count observed in a patient administered with Urtidin F. C tablet containing 150Â mg of 
 <italic>Urtica dioica</italic> L. The treatment showed medium activity with significant value at 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 compared to pre-treatment while there are no significant differences in control and placebo group (

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.1, respectively) (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Bakhshaee, 2017</xref>). This study was conducted in a randomized double-blind study clinical trial to identify the significant effects of the tablet formulation among AR patients. However, similar effects were demonstrated between the placebo group compared with the treated group based on the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test 22 (SNOT-22) of stinging nettle controlling the symptoms of AR. Therefore, the outcomes of this study showed a weak association between the effect of eosinophil suppression with its symptomatic relief outcomes.
