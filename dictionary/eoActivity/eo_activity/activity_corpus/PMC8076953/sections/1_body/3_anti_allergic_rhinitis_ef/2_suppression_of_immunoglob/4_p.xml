<p>An 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> study conducted in OVA-induced AR treated with a methanol extract of 
 <italic>Ostericum grosseserratum</italic> (Maxim.) Kitag. roots showed significant inhibition of OVA-specific IgE production in the OVA-sensitized mice IgE (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) as compared to control mice given OVA alone (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Jung et al., 2011</xref>). As the release of cytokines IL-4 and IFN-γ has a significant relation with the production of IgE elicited after exposure to an allergen, 100 mg/kg of the methanol extract of 
 <italic>O. grosseserratum</italic> significantly inhibited IL-4 production (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), compared with OVA-sensitized mice, and enhanced IFN-γ production (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). These results demonstrated that 
 <italic>O. grosseserratum</italic> extract could inhibit IgE production by the regulation of IL- 4/IFN-γ ratio in allergic responses.
