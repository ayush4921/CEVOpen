 <italic>Cinnamomum verum</italic> J. Presl bark extract was investigated for its potential effect in suppressing IgE levels in an OVA-induced animal model (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Aswar et al., 2015</xref>). At 10 and 30 μg/kg concentrations, the plant sample significantly prevented elevation of serum IgE levels as compared with AR control mice (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 and &lt;0.001, respectively). In comparison with the effect of IgE suppression by the plant extract, a positive control treated by xylometazoline showed statistically significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) inhibition of serum IgE level as compared with AR control mice. This study concluded that the extracts from the bark of 
 <italic>C. verum</italic> showed prophylactic potential against OVA-induced model through suppression of IgE as well as histamine release. This potential medicinal plant might be useful in managing AR. IgE may activate the mast cells 
 <italic>via</italic> the high-affinity receptor FcεRI. Therefore, prevention of IgE serum elevation by the extract of 
 <italic>C. verum</italic> indicated stabilization of mast cells as the mechanism of eosinophil recruitment without affecting level of nitric acid.
