<p>The 50% ethanol extract of peppermint or 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> × 
 <italic>piperita</italic> L. has been reported to inhibit histamine release from peritoneal mast cells of actively sensitized rats (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Inoue et al., 2002</xref>). The identify the compounds contained in the peppermint extract which leads to such a remarkable result was determined. There were six flavonoid glycosides isolated from the extract and luteolin-7-
 <italic>O</italic>-rutinoside 
 <bold>5</bold>) was the one that showed a potent inhibitory effect on histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells. This compound caused a dose-related inhibition of histamine release with a significant effect at 30 and 100 Mµ (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 and 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, respectively) as well as having inhibitory effects on sneezing and nasal rubbing at the dose of 300 mg/kg (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). Another study has also been conducted to thoroughly study the structure of this compound and it was found that the catechol structure in the Bring and the C2–C3 double bond in the C ring were essential for the inhibition of the histamine release (
