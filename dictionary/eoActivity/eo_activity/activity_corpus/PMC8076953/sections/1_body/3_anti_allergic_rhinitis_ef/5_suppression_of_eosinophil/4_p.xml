<p>In another 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> study, eosinophil suppression was found to be significant when treated with a standardized extract of 
 <italic>Rosa multiflora</italic> Thunb. (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Bui et al., 2019b</xref>). Different doses (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg) of standardized extract of 
 <italic>R. multiflora</italic> were used in this study. At 100 mg/kg the extract showed medium activity with a significant decrease in eosinophil levels (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) but stronger activity in eosinophil suppression was observed at the doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) when compared with OVA group. Dexamethasone, used as a positive control also showed a significant difference similar to 200 and 400 mg/kg of 
 <italic>R. multiflorae</italic> extracts compared with the OVA-induced model. Hence, the standardized 
 <italic>R. multiflorae</italic> extracts at the stated doses might have nearly the same efficacy as the present conventional drug, dexamethasone (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Bui et al., 2019b</xref>). The relative symptomatic effect might be explained by observing the epithelial swelling of OVA-induced subject as eosinophils-derived mediators induced epithelial damage leading to nasal mucosal swelling (
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">Skoner, 2001</xref>). A significant difference in amelioration of epithelial swelling was observed in OVA subject treated with 200 and 400 mg/kg of standardized 
 <italic>R. multiflorae</italic> extracts with significant value at 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 while epithelial swelling was ameliorated with a significant decrease of 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 when treated with dexamethasone. Dexamethasone might have a better effect on alleviating the symptoms by ameliorating the epithelial swelling. However, a clinical trial on its effect on human subjects is needed to investigate its effects on the human subject. Yet, this medicinal plant may have a promising future as an alternative treatment for AR.
