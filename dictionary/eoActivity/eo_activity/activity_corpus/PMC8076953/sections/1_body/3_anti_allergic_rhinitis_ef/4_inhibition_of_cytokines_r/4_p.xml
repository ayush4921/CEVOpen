<p>Apart from interleukins, several other types of cytokines that might be involved in the cascades of allergic reaction in AR are interferon-gamma (IFN-ƴ) and retinoid-related orphan receptor gamma t (RORc). An 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> study investigated the possible chemical mediators or key components involved in the pathophysiology of AR such as Th1 related cytokines as well as Th17 related cytokines (
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2008</xref>). The experiment conducted on OVA-induced mice showed a significant decrease (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in the level of Th1 related cytokines such as IL-12 when treated with 100 mg/kg/day of 
 <italic>Piper nigrum</italic> L. extract with a significant increase in IFN-ƴ (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The level of IL-12 showed a significant decrease at 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 when treated with a higher dose of 
 <italic>P. nigrum</italic> at 200 mg/kg/day while there was a significant decrease with p&lt; 0.01 in IFN-ƴ level given with the same dose when compared with OVA group. Besides, 
 <italic>P. nigrum</italic> also showed a significant effect on Th17 related cytokines such as IL-5, IL-13, and RORc. The lowest dose of 
 <italic>P. nigrum</italic> (50 mg/kg/day) given to the subject has also shown a significant decrease on IL-5 and IL-13 levels (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 and 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, respectively). At the dose of 100 mg/kg/day, 
 <italic>P. nigrum</italic> has shown a significant decrease in the levels of IL-5 with 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 and 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 in IL-13 and RORc levels. There’s a significant decrease at 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 in IL-5, RORc, IL-13 levels respectively compared with the OVA group when 200 mg/kg/ml of 
 <italic>P. nigrum</italic> was given to the subject. This shows that 
 <italic>P. nigrum</italic> has a strong activity in reducing IL-5 levels compared to other types of cytokines at 100 mg/kg/day. 
 <italic>P. nigrum</italic> may provide a promising strategy for immunotherapy in airway diseases such as AR as it exhibits several different mechanisms that act against the cascades in AR model to alleviate the symptoms present through a subsequent series of a pathway in the pathophysiology of AR. RORc was shown to regulate Th17 differentiation, but it’s a deficiency, did not completely abolish TH17 related cytokine expression (
