<p>Shikonin 
 <bold>(1)</bold>, a derivative of naphthoquinone, isolated from the roots of 
 <italic>Symphytum officinale</italic> L. was evaluated for its curative effect on IgE production during allergic reaction in an OVA-induced AR rat model. The findings indicated that in three shikonin groups (intraperitoneal injection with 200, 400 and 600 μg/kg of shikonin), the OVA-specific IgE and IL-4 serum levels were significantly decreased and the serum IFN-γ level was markedly increased as compared with the model group. In addition, the shikonin groups also decreased the GATA-3 protein expression level and increased the T-bet protein in nasal mucosa tissue. There were increase of GSH-Px and SOD levels but a decrease in the MDA level as compared to the model group (
