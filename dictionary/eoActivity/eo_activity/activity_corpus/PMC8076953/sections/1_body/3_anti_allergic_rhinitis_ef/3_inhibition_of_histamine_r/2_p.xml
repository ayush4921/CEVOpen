 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 between 20 and 40 μg/ml of WGE, respectively, compared to histamine-induced HeLa. WGE suppressed histamine signaling through the inhibition of histamine-induced upregulation of H1R gene expression. They reported that PKCδ signaling was involved in the expression of the H1R gene. Western-blot analysis suggested that inhibition of phosphorylation of Tyr311 was the underlying mechanism of the suppressive effect of WGE on the up-regulation of H1R gene expression as Tyr311 was crucial for the activation of PKCδ (

WGE showed a strong activity in inhibiting histamine release conducted against AR-induced model and thus might be helpful in alleviating the symptoms in AR. Clinical studies should be conducted in order to assess its safety and efficacy in a human model.
