<p>Previous studies on 
 <italic>Cissampelos sympodialis</italic> Eichler has led to the discovery of several alkaloids and their bioactivities (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Barbosa-Filho et al., 2000</xref>). It was discovered that warifteine (
 <bold>3</bold>) was the compound responsible for the immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects of the plant on models of inflammation (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Costa et al., 2008</xref>). Considering the urgency in developing a monotherapy to treat AR, an 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> study has been conducted to analyze the therapeutic potential of warifteine (
 <bold>3</bold>) and methylwarifteine (
 <bold>4</bold>) on the combined AR and asthma syndrome model (CARAS) (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Cavalcanti et al., 2020</xref>). In this study, the treatment with both compounds has shown a significant decrease of OVA-specific IgE at 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01. Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation is related to the production of several inflammatory mediators, including cytokines in the inflamed site while the cytokines such as 1L-4,1L-5, and IL-13 are responsible for the allergic-specific IgE production promoting AR symptoms (
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">Schuliga, 2015</xref>). In a similar study, the effect of these two compounds was conducted on NF-κB and both compounds have shown a significant decrease in NF-κB (p65) at 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Cavalcanti et al., 2020</xref>). The isolated compounds found in 
 <italic>C. sympodialis</italic> may have a promising potential as a phytopharmaceutical prototype for allergies but a further study may have to be conducted for its efficacy and safety in a mammal or human model.
