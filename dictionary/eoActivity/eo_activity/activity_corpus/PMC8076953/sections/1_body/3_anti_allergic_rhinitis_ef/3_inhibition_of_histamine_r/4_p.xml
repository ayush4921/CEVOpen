<p>Hydroalcoholic extract of 
 <italic>Cinnamomum verum</italic> J. Presl standardized to type-A procynidines polyphenols (CZ-TAPP) was evaluated for its anti-allergic effect at the dose of 3, 10 and 30 μg/kg in OVA-induced AR in BALB/c mice. At 10 and 30 μg/kg treatment the animals showed significant prevention of elevated serum histamine levels as compared with AR control mice (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 and 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, respectively). There were induction of rubbing reflex and sneezing in AR control mice as compared to normal mice upon histamine challenge. These elevation in histamine release may results in increased mucus secretion, vascular permeability, edema and contraction of smooth muscle. The treatment with 
 <italic>C. verum</italic> extracts significantly reduced these histamine-induced symptoms. CZ-TAPP has showed a strong inhibition in IgE serum and histamine release as compared with AR control mice while showing reduction of symptoms as well such as sneezing and rubbing (
