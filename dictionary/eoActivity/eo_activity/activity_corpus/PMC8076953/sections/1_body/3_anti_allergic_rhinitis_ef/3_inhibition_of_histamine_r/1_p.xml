<p>Allergen exposure against which they are sensitized, may results in nasal symptoms within minutes as there is cross-linking by the allergen of IgE bound to mucosal mast cells (

Th2 inflammation develops in the nasal mucosa of the AR patient during the next hours, with the participation of a wide array of cytokines and chemokines. This is due to the complex interaction of mast cells, dendritic cells, eosinophils, T cells, epithelial cells, innate lymphoid cells, as well as the basophils (

As histamine is one of the most important key components in an early phase of AR pathophysiology and gives immediate symptoms within few minutes of allergen exposure, it has been the potential target in managing AR disease in human. This might provide a fast relieve in a patient with AR stimulated by a certain type of allergens.
