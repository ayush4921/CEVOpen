<p>The nasal mucosal tissues of AR has illustrated an elevation in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as the IL-1, thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), and TNF-α (

 <italic>Allium hookeri</italic> Thwaites ethanol extract significantly reduced the increased rubs scores and IgE and IL 4 levels in OVA-sensitized mice with significant values at 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05. Being a specific inducer of IgE, IL 4 modulates a variety of inflammatory mediators release from immune cells, resulting in increased vascular permeability, increased mucus secretion in the nasal mucosa and inflammatory cells infiltration (

 <italic>A. hookeri</italic> at various concentrations of 100, 200, 300 μg/mL has been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory activity by inhibition of NO and ROS productions (

Moreover, it could inhibit adipogenesis by promoting lipolysis by suppressing adipogenic factors expression including controlled amino acid therapy (CAAT)/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in 3T3-L1(mouse cell line) adipocytes (
