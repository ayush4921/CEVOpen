<p>Several clinical investigations have been conducted to verify whether the medicinal plants may target IgE, to suppress its release in patients with AR. Most of the clinical studies conducted were mainly focused on observing the relief of AR symptoms upon their administration. Measurement of IgE serum level was not commonly conducted in clinical studies. One of the clinical trials conducted to observe significant changes in IgE serum level was a double-blind and prospective study on the effect of the oil of 
 <italic>Nigella sativa</italic> L. in 66 AR patients (
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">Nikakhlagh et al., 2011</xref>). High level of IgE that was presented in 57.5% of the volunteers (&gt;100Â IU/ml) was not always accompanied by allergy symptoms. In fact, severe allergy symptoms have shown in patients with low IgE levels. Allergen-induced rhinitis that causes an up-regulation in the expression of high-affinity receptors reflects more of its true activity rather than the initial concentration of circulating IgE levels in the serum (

 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0708) while the differences in IgE before and after a nasal wash in the 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic>-treatment and placebo groups were also statistically significant at 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0065 and 0.2800, respectively. However, the average of IgE from the nasal wash in the 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic>-treatment group before and after the treatment in between both study (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0017) and placebo group (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.455) was insignificant (
