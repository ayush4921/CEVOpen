<p>An overall state of allergic conditions may be determined by the increase in eosinophils in the blood. Eosinophils level was increased in toluene 2,4-diisocyanate (TDI)-induced allergic mice model showing that this is one of the most important key components in understanding AR. Results from this study have shown that the treatment with an oral dose of 
 <italic>Acanthus ilicifolius</italic> L. ethanolic extract (500 mg/kg) and cetrizine (20 mg/kg) could decrease the count of these inflammatory cells as compared to TDI-control (p&lt; 0.05) (
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">Sardar et al., 2018</xref>). Symptoms wise, 
 <italic>A. ilicifolius</italic> ethanol extracts significantly suppressed sneezing and nasal score with medium activity with a significant value at p&lt; 0.05 for both responding variables. It may be well explained with the significant suppression of related key components that play important roles in this disease such as eosinophil.
