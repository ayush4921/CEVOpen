<p>Medicinal plants and their bioactive metabolites possess different mechanisms of action in combating the mediators of immune system involved in AR inflammatory cascades or allergic reaction pathways. Some of these phytochemicals have anti-allergic properties as well as anti-inflammatory properties which may be useful to treat different types of allergic diseases and symptoms. Several cellular, animal and clinical studies have been performed to evaluate the anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory properties of medicinal plants particularly in treating AR by using AR-induced model or AR patients. There are numerous number of mediators involved in the pathophysiology of AR. These different targeted cells or mediators are important key components for different types of phytochemicals found in many different medicinal plants. The phytochemicals may be effectively acting against the important key components involved and thus alleviating the symptoms in the patient with AR. Anti-allergic rhinitis effects of medicinal plants and their bioactive metabolites may be by suppression of the immune system through suppression of IgE, inhibition of cytokines production, inhibition of histamine release and suppression of eosinophil production.</p>
