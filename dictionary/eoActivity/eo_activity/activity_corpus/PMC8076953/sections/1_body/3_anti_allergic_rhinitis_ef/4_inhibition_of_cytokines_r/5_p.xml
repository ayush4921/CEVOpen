<p>A syrup formulation of 
 <italic>Zataria multiflora</italic> Boiss. was prepared and investigated in a randomized clinical trial conducted in 43 individuals with a history of seasonal AR. A 20% 
 <italic>Z. multiflora</italic> hydroalcoholic extract was diluted to achieve the final concentration of thymol and carvacrol of 20.5 and 2.85 mg/100 ml, respectively. The study investigated the effect of this formulation on the expression of Treg related cytokines IL-17, IL-4 as well as other types of cytokines and TH17 cells. 
 <italic>Z. multiflora</italic> syrup formulation decreased IL-17 expression with a significant difference at (p&lt; 0.05) compared to the control group (

 <italic>Z. multiflora</italic> has shown a moderate activity in reducing IL-17 against patient with AR. Apart from its anti-allergic rhinitis effect, the erial parts of 
 <italic>Z. multiflora</italic> has an anti-amnesic effect and might improve memory deficit through anticholinesterase activity. Multiple-dose injection of 
 <italic>Z. multiflora</italic> extract could dose-dependently inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AchE) in the brain hippocampus of scopolamine-induced amnesia rats (
