<p>Okicamelliaside (
 <bold>2</bold>), an ellagic acid glucoside has been isolated from 
 <italic>Camellia japonica</italic> L. It is a highly potent anti-degranulation and has potential to suppress allergic reaction 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> (
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">Onodera et al., 2010</xref>). In an 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> study the compound was investigated for its ability to inhibit AR in male BALB/c mice which were stimulated with a Japanese cedar pollen extract and challenged by nasal instillation of the antigen. Intraperitoneal administration of okicamelliaside at 0.2 mg/kg for 24 days resulted in a decrease in the sneezing frequency during the 10 min immediately after the challenge. Okicamelliaside exhibited 12,000 times potency in suppressing sneezing effect compared to ketotifen fumarate, an anti-allergic drug used as control. The sneezing frequency varied widely between individuals in the control, ketotifen fumarate and okicamelliaside groups. However, there was no significant difference in IgE levels, suggesting that KF and okicamelliaside might exert anti-allergic activity by suppressing degranulation instead (
