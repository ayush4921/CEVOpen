<p>The most common potential target in treating AR is the suppression of histamine release as histamine is one of the most important key components in an early phase of AR pathophysiology and gives immediate symptoms within few minutes of allergen exposure. Current conventional treatment administers antihistamine drugs as first-line therapy. However, other mechanistic effects such as suppression of IgE, inhibition of cytokines production and suppression of eosinophil production have also been used as targets in efforts to search for bioactive principles from medicinal plants with strong anti-allergic rhinitis activity. Various 
 <italic>in vivo, in vitro</italic> and clinical studies on medicinal plants and their bioactive metabolites have been carried out to evaluate their anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory properties particularly in treating AR by using various immune cells, AR-induced models or AR patients. There was remarkable amount of experimental data that have been generated and they can be further developed as potential source of new anti-allergic rhinitis agents. However, most studies on the medicinal plants including clinical trials were carried out using the crude extracts of the plants as the extracts were not standardized or chemically characterized and the active chemical markers were mostly not identified. The bioactive metabolites contributing to the anti-allergic rhinitis effect have not been well determined. For future studies sufficient preclinical testing should be generated using standardized extracts, which include bioavailability, pharmacokinetic and toxicological studies, before they can be subjected to clinical studies. Based on

 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies several bioactive metabolites of the plant extracts including shikonin (

These bioactive compounds have to be further subjected to systematic and operationally thorough controlled randomized trials to prove its safety and efficacy for human use in treating AR.
