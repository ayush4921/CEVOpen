<p>The medicinal plants discussed in this review might have potential to be developed as alternatives to treat symptoms of AR. However, further studies should be carried out to determine their safety level for human use specifically in treating AR. Safety is the most important aspect in developing medicinal or health products. Thus, toxicity studies of the medicinal plants and their bioactive metabolites should be performed and reviewed to identify their potential acute or chronic toxicity that might be encountered upon using them as therapeutic agents for treating allergic diseases such as AR. Some toxicity studies have been conducted for some of these potential medicinal plants.</p>
