<p>An acute and chronic toxicity studies on the 95% ethanol extract of 
 <italic>Cinnamomum verum</italic> J. Presl have been conducted by 
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">Shah et al. (1998)</xref>. Thirty-five mice were randomly divided into six 
 <italic>C. verum</italic>-treatment groups and a control and the mice were observed for signs of toxicity and mortality after 24 h. There was some decreased locomotor activity at 3 g/kg dose, suggesting that it might possess narcotic effects at high doses. In a chronic toxicity study, the mice were treated with 100 mg/kg of 
 <italic>C. verum</italic> extract for three weeks. Mortality in the 
 <italic>C. verum</italic> treatment group was statistically insignificant (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) compared to the control. It was observed that only one male mouse developed inflammation of hind limb which was cleared up during the next few weeks. The condition of the viscera and vital organs weight in the treated animals were normal and comparable to the control except for a decrease in the weight of the liver. There was a decrease in hemoglobin contents base on hematological studies.
