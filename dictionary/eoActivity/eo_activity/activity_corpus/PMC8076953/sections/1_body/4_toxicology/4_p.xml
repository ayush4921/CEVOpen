<p>The acute toxicity test of aqueous and hexane extracts of 
 <italic>Urtica dioica</italic> L. at the concentrations of 250, 500, 1000, and 2000 mg/kg administered orally in Wistar rats have shown no mortality during 24 h period. No stereotypical toxic symptoms such as ataxia, convulsion, increased diuresis or diarrhea were observed, except the fourth group (2000 mg/kg) which exhibited symptoms like diuresis and diarrhea (

 <italic>Zataria multiflora</italic> Boiss extracts in mice were conducted. The animals were injected intraperitoneally with various doses of the extracts and the mortality was determined at 48 h after treatment. Based on the LD
 <sub>50</sub> values, the ethanolic extract (3.47 g/kg) was more toxic than the aqueous extract (3.85 g/kg) and these extracts are relatively toxic. The maximum non-fatal doses for the aqueous and ethanol extracts were 2.2 and 2 g/kg, respectively (
