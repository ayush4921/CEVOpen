<p>Current treatment to treat symptoms of AR include the use of antihistamines, intranasal corticosteroids, decongestants, intranasal cromolyn, intranasal anticholinergics, leukotriene receptor antagonists and immunotherapy. Antihistamines inhibit receptor activity, and some can additionally stabilize the H
 <sub>1</sub>-receptor inverse agonists or mast cells (

However, for the relief of nasal congestion, antihistamines use is less effective and usually need to be combined with a decongestant or intranasal corticosteroid (

The side effects of the use of conventional medicines have led to many studies to find alternative ways to help to reduce the symptoms of this disease. Some natural products such as garlic and Andrographis paniculata (Burm.f.) Nees have been used to provide symptom relief for nasal congestion which is also one of the symptoms in AR. Various treatment options are targeting different key components to help to relieve AR symptoms. However, the scientific or evidence-based research on the efficacy and safety of the plants have not yet been proven in many studies upon AR models or subjects. Therefore, many studies have been conducted in search of medicinal plants that have a promising potential of being a better alternative to provide symptoms relief in AR.
