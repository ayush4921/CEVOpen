<p>The pathophysiology of AR disease is quite complex as it involves several chemical mediators or antibodies in immunological cascades. Therefore, these different mediators or antibodies involved in the pathophysiology of the disease might be the potential targets in treating AR. It is very crucial to understand the pathophysiology of this disease in developing a potential remedy and alternative therapy for a wide population of AR patients. Avoidance of potential allergens that might trigger an allergic reaction is the best way to prevent AR occurrence (

Treating the symptoms by using conventional or alternative therapy may be efficient but it is important to identify the triggers or allergens to avoid repetitive occurrence. It may be difficult to avoid the potential allergen exposure and therefore the use of medicine is needed to provide fast relief. The use of conventional medicine has an increasing trend as the number of people having this disease has also increased.
