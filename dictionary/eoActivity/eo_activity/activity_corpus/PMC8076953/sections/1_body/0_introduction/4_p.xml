<p>The search for new therapeutic agents from medicinal plants to treat AR is definitely needed especially plants which have shown positive outcomes in exerting anti-allergic properties, particularly toward AR animal models. Medicinal plants and their bioactive metabolites possess different mechanisms of action in combating the mediators or immune system involved in AR inflammatory cascades or allergic reaction pathways. Some of these phytochemicals have anti-allergic properties as well as anti-inflammatory properties which may be useful to treat different types of allergic diseases and symptoms. Numerous studies have been performed to determine the anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic properties of medicinal plants particularly in treating AR through 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies and clinical trials by using AR-induced model or AR patients, respectively. There are numerous number of mediators involved in the pathophysiology of AR. These different targeted cells or mediators are important key components for different types of phytochemicals found in medicinal plants. AR is one of the types of allergy that manifest an abnormal regulation of the immune system.
