<p>DC form a network that is localized within the submucosa and epithelium of the entire respiratory mucosa which as well includes the nasal mucosa (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Hartmann et al., 2006</xref>). In AR patients, there is an elevation in the levels of both T-cells and DC (
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">Sin and Togias, 2011</xref>). Processed antigens and the tissue microenvironment may send signals to DC that will then polarize naive T cells into either Th1 or Th2 cells and their respective cytokines (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Liu, 2005</xref>). The epithelial cells release thymic stromal lymphopoietin and prostaglandin E
 <sub>2</sub> which may also send signals to DC and cause such polarization (

 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Maggi et al., 2007</xref>). Clinical allergy will develop based on the balance between certain Treg populations and Th2. Cytokines such as IL-3 and IL-4 provides the first essential signal that causes IgE production

In the second signal, costimulatory interaction between CD40 ligand on both B-cell surface and T-cell surface will eventually promote activation of B-cell and switch recombination for the production of IgE (

 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">Sih and Mion, 2010</xref>). In the late-phase response, fatigue, congestion, malaise, and irritability occur at 6–24 h after exposure to an allergen that involves the influx of inflammatory cells into the nasal mucosa (
