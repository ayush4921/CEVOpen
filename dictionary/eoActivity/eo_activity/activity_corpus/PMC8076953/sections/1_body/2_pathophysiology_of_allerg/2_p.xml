<p>Nasal responsiveness occurs with regards to our body normal function or termed as homeostasis in which the body reacts toward an occurrence of abnormal changes with normal response and intensity. Hyperresponsiveness of AR disease might be due to alteration toward the normal responsiveness as a result of genetical or pathological factors affecting the structural or functional elements of the nasal mucosa (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> which leads to the obvious clinical features present in AR patients. Sensitization is a process by which the immune system will produce the antibody or more specifically the IgE antibody, in response to certain types of particles or allergens it considered abnormal. The process begins in the nasal tissues where allergens will be engulfed by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), broken into allergenic peptides and migrate to lymph nodes (
