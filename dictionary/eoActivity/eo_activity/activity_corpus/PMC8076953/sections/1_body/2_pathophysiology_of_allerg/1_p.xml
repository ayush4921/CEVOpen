<p>RA is a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction which occurs when there are specific triggers from allergens’ exposure including pests, dust mites, some molds and pets. This will bring about the subsequent flow of biochemical and immunological activities leading to the clinical manifestation of the disease. Exposure to allergens may induce IgE antibodies to bind to the high-affinity receptor (FcεRI) on the surface of mast cells, basophils, and antigen-presenting cells and causes sensitization (

 <sub>1</sub> and H
 <sub>2</sub> receptors on mucosal blood vessels and H
 <sub>1</sub> receptors on sensory nerve endings leading to vascular engorgement (

Pathways involved in the pathophysiology of AR will eventually lead to the manifestations of various common symptoms in AR triggered by the allergen in which the patient is sensitive. Understanding the pathophysiology of AR might in a way help to explain the pathways involved in eliciting the symptoms and thus explained the rational treatment approach indicated.
