<p>APCs such as immature dendritic cells (DC) capture allergens, mature, and migrate to the draining lymph nodes. The processed allergen will then be presented to naive T cells (

Activation of epithelial cells simultaneously by non-antigenic pathways such as proteases may lead to epithelial cytokines release of which polarizes the action into Th2 response by inducing the expression of genes that promote Th2 survival (

This occurrence will eventually lead to repeated AR events as the IgE binding to mast cell and basophils will recognize the presence of allergens invading the body when re-exposure occurred (
