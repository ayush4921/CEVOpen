<p>This study evaluated the preventive and control effects of six components in ARR volatiles against 
 <italic>P. operculella.</italic> The fumigation test on adults and eggs of 
 <italic>P. operculella</italic> showed that the fumigation effects of methyl eugenol, eucarvone, and 3,5-dimethoxytoluene were stronger than the effects of δ-3-carene, γ-terpinene, and terpinolene. The oviposition deterrent experiment showed that only methyleugenol (at 5 and 1 mg/ml) and eucarvone (5 mg/ml) had a substantial oviposition deterrent effect. The simulated warehouse experiment verified that methyleugenol, eucarvone, and 3,5-dimethoxytoluene protected potatoes from 
 <italic>P. operculella</italic> and demonstrated that methyleugenol had the best preventive and control effects. Other studies on insecticide, acaricide, and anti-microorganism have confirmed that methyleugenol is the main active ingredient in the volatiles from ARR (

 <italic>P. operculella.</italic> Further studies on its mode of action, residues, and influence on potato germination are needed. In addition to screening for the active ingredients in ARR volatiles, studies on the nonvolatile ingredients of ARR should be conducted in the development of ARR in the search for plant-derived pesticides. (−)-asarinin and pellitorine were active components with acaricidal and (or) insecticidal activities, which had been screened from the nonvolatile components of ARR (
