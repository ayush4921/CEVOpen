<p>The experimental results showed that the six compounds had fumigation toxic effects on the adults and eggs of 
 <italic>P. operculella</italic>. Among them, δ-3-carene, γ-terpinene, and terpinolene had weaker fumigation effects than those of eucarvone, 3,5-dimethoxytoluene, and methyleugenol. The LC
 <sub>50</sub> was &gt;4.1 for 
 <italic>P. operculella</italic> adults treated with δ-3-carene, γ-terpinene, and terpinolene and the LC
 <sub>50</sub> was &lt;1.8 for 
 <italic>P. operculella</italic> adults treated with eucarvone, 3,5-dimethoxytoluene, and methyleugenol. The LC
 <sub>50</sub> was &gt;2.6 for 
 <italic>P. operculella</italic> eggs treated with δ-3-carene, γ-terpinene, and terpinolene and the LC
 <sub>50</sub> was &lt;1.1 for the 
 <italic>P. operculella</italic> eggs treated with eucarvone, 3,5-dimethoxytoluene, and methyleugenol. Among eucarvone, 3,5-dimethoxytoluene, and methyleugenol, eucarvone had the strongest fumigation effect on the adults and methyleugenol had the strongest fumigation effect on the eggs.
