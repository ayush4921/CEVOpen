<p>Furthermore, carvacrol is a confirmed antitumor agent. It was demonstrated that supplementation with carvacrol exhibits the antitumor effect on liver cancer induced with diethylnitrosamine in Wistar albino rats, most likely protecting the antioxidant defense system and preventing lipid peroxidation and damage of liver cells [

In addition, it was determined that carvacrol can induce apoptosis in cell lines of the hepatocellular carcinoma and the results suggest that the induction of apoptosis can be performed through direct activation of the mitochondrial pathway, and mitogen-activated protein kinase can have a significant role the antitumor effect of carvacrol [
