<p>It can be noted that SC extracts applied as pretreatment and treatment exhibited a more dominant effect on SD. The content of carvacrol in SC extracts is significantly higher compared to SD; hence, that could be the reason for SC extractsâ€™ higher impact on the antioxidant status of EAC cells. Furthermore, when they were applied as treatment, SC extracts resulted in the reduction in the volume of ascites (statistically insignificant) and the decrease in malignant cells. On the other hand, SC extracts applied as pretreatment did not have an impact on the decrease of number of malignant cells so they cannot be considered as cytotoxic or cytostatic agents.</p>
