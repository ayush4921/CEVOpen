<p>During the development of tumor, the cells become resistant due to constant exposure to oxidative stress and they develop strong mechanisms of antioxidative protection [

However, after the application of certain extracts, it was observed that there was an increase in the XOD activity, decrease in the CAT activity, and an increase in the intensity of LPx. Moreover, it was recorded that there was a decrease in the values of GSH in EAC cells in all groups of examined animals (except for groups post-treated with SC1, SC5, and SD5), as well as an increase in GR and GSHPx in malignant cells after the application of 
 <italic>S. montana</italic> extract. These enzymes represent markers of oxidative stress and their increased activity suggests that due to the application of certain extracts, malignant cells were exposed to oxidative stress. As a result, it was determined that extracts of 
 <italic>S. montana</italic> induce the production of reactive oxygen species in malignant EAC cells. However, the exact mechanism of activity was not clarified and further research is necessary.
