<p>The study investigated the antiproliferative activity of 
 <italic>S. montana</italic> extracts obtained by different techniques of extraction. Modern extraction techniques were selected which, once the process is established, can easily be scaled-up to an industrial level and provide high-quality extracts while protecting the environment. The Sc-CO
 <sub>2</sub> extraction represents the method of choice for the isolation of lipophilic components [

The spray drying process has proved to be the superior and efficient method because it is multiple times cheaper compared to freeze drying and provides extracts of extended stability with the possibility of concealing unpleasant odors and tastes. In addition, the smaller volume of extracts compared to liquid ones further contributes to lower expenses of storage and transport. Furthermore, dry extracts are characterized by instantaneous solubility and they can easily be incorporated in other products like pills and tablets and instant teas [
