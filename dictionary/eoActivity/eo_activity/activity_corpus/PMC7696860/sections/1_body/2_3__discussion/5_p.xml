<p>In the studies which in their focus have the investigation of antitumor potential of 
 <italic>S. montana</italic> extracts, the precise mechanism responsible for the antitumor activity has not been determined. The antiproliferative activity of different extracts of 
 <italic>S. montana</italic> was investigated on HeLa (human cervix adenocarcinoma) [

 <xref rid="B20-plants-09-01532" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], HT-29 (human colon adenocarcinoma) [
 <xref rid="B20-plants-09-01532" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and MCF-7 (human breast adenocarcinoma) [
 <xref rid="B20-plants-09-01532" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], K562 (human chronic myelogenous leukemia cells [
 <xref rid="B19-plants-09-01532" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and MDA-MB-453 (breast cancer cells) [
 <xref rid="B19-plants-09-01532" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. A strong antioxidative capacity of 
 <italic>S. montana</italic> extracts was confirmed along with their antiproliferative properties that were different depending on the type of extract. The authors made an assumption that 
 <italic>S. montana</italic> as a strong antioxidant can impact the redox condition of cells which leads to decreased cell proliferation. A low level of free oxygen species is necessary to promote cell proliferation and redox changes have a significant role in the signal traductional pathway, which is important for the regulation of growth of cells [
