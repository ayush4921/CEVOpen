<p>This study investigated the antiproliferative activity of supercritical and spray dried extracts of 
 <italic>S. montana</italic> by using in vivo mice model. The impact of extracts on malignant cells was observed by applying the extracts as pretreatment, treatment, and posttreatment. It was determined that the time of application of extracts represents a significant parameter in the treatment of EAC cells. The assumption is that there was a significant development of tumors in the groups in which extracts were applied as posttreatment and that the application of extracts did not demonstrate to be an efficient approach. On the other hand, the extracts that were applied as pretreatment and treatment exhibited a far more significant effect on malign cells. The changes in the activities of biochemical parameters that represent markers of oxidative stress indicate that the malignant were exposed to oxidative stress when extracts were applied. Therefore, the results suggest that the extracts resulted in the generation of reactive oxygen species in malignant EAC cells.
