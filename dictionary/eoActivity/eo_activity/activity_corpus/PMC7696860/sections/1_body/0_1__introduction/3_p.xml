<p>The induction of apoptosis of cancer cells without significant side effects is a characteristic of a good chemoprotective agent [
 <xref rid="B10-plants-09-01532" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Therefore, herbal extracts represent excellent candidates for research in this area as potential non-toxic agents. Herbal polyphenols demonstrated to be significant potential chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agents considering that they can lead to the suppression of malignant proliferation with different mechanisms. Additionally, they can have an effect on the reduction of consequences of oxidative stress. For certain herbal species that belong to the 
 <italic>Satureja</italic> genus, it was determined that they exhibit antiproliferative activity. Examples of those species are: 
 <italic>Satureja thymbra</italic> and 
 <italic>Satureja parnassica</italic> [
