<p>The intensity of the lipid peroxidation in the group with EAC was low. In the application of extracts in the pretreatment, only SC extracts led to a significant increase in the intensity of the lipid peroxidation. The treatment with extracts did not have a statistically significant impact on the changes in intensity of LPx. By post-treating mice with extracts, the changes in the intensity of LPx were significant, so the post-treatment with SD1 resulted in an increase, while others caused a decrease in the intensity of LPx.</p>
