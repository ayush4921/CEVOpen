<p>Compared to the activity of CAT in the EAC control group, the application of extracts resulted in a different impact on the activity of this enzyme. In the groups pretreated with extracts, the activity of CAT in EAC cells was significantly increased with the application of SD1, while it was significantly decreased in other pretreated groups. Moreover, the highest decrease was achieved when SC5 was applied in the pretreatment. The treatment with extracts in all animal groups caused significant changes in the CAT activity. In the pretreatment, the application of SD1 increased the CAT activity, while all other extracts caused a decrease in the activity of CAT of malignant cells. The application of extracts in post-treatments in all groups caused significant changes compared to the EAC control group in terms of decreasing the CAT activity with posttreatment with SD1, and an increase in the remaining three groups of post-treated mice.</p>
