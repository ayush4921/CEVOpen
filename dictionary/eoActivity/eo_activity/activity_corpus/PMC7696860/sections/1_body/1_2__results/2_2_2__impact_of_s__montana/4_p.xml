<p>The activity of Px in malignant cells compared to the control EAC group increased after the application of SC extracts and SD5 in pretreatments. The treatment with SD1 resulted in a decrease in the activity of Px, and an increase was determined in the treatments with SD5, SC1, and SC5. In post-treated groups, the SD1 extract caused changes in the intensity through the increase in the Px activity, while SD5 and SC decreased the activity of Px in EAC cells.</p>
