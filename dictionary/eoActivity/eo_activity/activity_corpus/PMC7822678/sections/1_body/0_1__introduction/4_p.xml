<p>A recently published ethnobotanical survey from the Greater Mpigi region [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and an ethnopharmacological study [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] identified 16 medicinal plant species that are often used in the treatment of medical disorders in the local traditional medicine system while displaying high pharmacological activity in our ongoing 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> evaluation in a lab setting. A preliminary literature review resulted in a few results. Therefore, these 16 plants are suspected to be understudied species, and a thorough literature review using the new DoP method for bibliographic assessment enables the selection of traditionally used species for pharmacological bioassays and drug discovery strategies. Our study, therefore, aims to undertake a comparative literature assessment, applying the DoP method, regarding (a) other reports of these species, (b) the quality of the journals where results were published in (assessment of international standards and best practice in scholarly publication ethics), and (c) the degree to which each plant species has been studied thus far.
