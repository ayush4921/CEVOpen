<p>In consideration of this global importance, there are many assessment tools applied when reporting field studies in the science of ethnopharmacology. These include field assessment indices for medicinally used species, such as the frequency of citation, use value, informant consensus factor, and fidelity level, among others. However, none of these take into account how to really determine which species merit the costly lab studies. This is why we introduce the Degrees of Publication (DoPs), providing a standardized way to examine how well studied individual species are (or are not) in an ethnopharmacological context. In this study, 16 medicinal plant species from the Greater Mpigi region were selected to illustrate how the new tool works.</p>
