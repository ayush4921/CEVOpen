<p>An extensive literature survey successfully assessed the degree to which a plant species has been studied so far, introducing a new indicator: the Degrees of Publication (DoPs). This literature assessment resulted in the identification of understudied plants among the selected 16 species. Three plant species were identified as being moderately studied (
 <italic>E. abyssinica</italic>, 
 <italic>W. ugandensis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Z. chalybeum</italic>), while four have already been highly studied over the past decades (
 <italic>C. molle</italic>, 
 <italic>H. madagascariensis</italic>, 
 <italic>S. longipedunculata</italic>, and 
 <italic>T. asiatica</italic>). More importantly, the majority of plant species surveyed have not yet been investigated sufficiently. Six species were classified as being highly understudied (
 <italic>C. buchananii</italic>, 
 <italic>F. saussureana</italic>, 
 <italic>L. calostachys</italic>, 
 <italic>M. lycopodioides</italic>, 
 <italic>M. kandtiana</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. calycinum</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>angustifolium</italic>) and three more species as being understudied (
 <italic>A. coriaria</italic>, 
 <italic>P. hadiensis</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. aculeastrum</italic>). Due to the absence of any bioactivity-related publications for 
 <italic>S. calycinum</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>angustifolium</italic>, 
 <italic>M. lycopodioides</italic>, and 
 <italic>M. kandtiana</italic>, pharmacological evaluation of these species should be prioritized. The need for research and development of novel natural products is more vital than ever, making future studies on traditional herbal remedies justified and urgently required.
