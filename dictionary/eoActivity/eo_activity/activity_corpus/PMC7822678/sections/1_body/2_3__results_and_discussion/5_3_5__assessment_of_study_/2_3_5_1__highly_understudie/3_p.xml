<p>Traditional use of the shrub 
 <italic>M. kandtiana</italic> has also only been previously described in two publications following ethnobotanical surveys. Just as in our ethnobotanical study in the Greater Mpigi region [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], its roots were cited to be used in treatment of HIV/AIDS in one of the four surveyed Ugandan districts [
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The second paper names 
 <italic>M. kandtiana</italic> bark, leaves, and fruits as a natural remedy in treatment of tuberculosis (fruits, leaves, roots, and bark used) in the Butambala and Mpigi Districts, which constitute a major part of the Greater Mpigi region [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In our ethnobotanical survey [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], we were able to confirm these citations of traditional use in the study area (root bark, leaves, and roots). There were no other publications from any other field identified, mentioning 
 <italic>M. kandtiana</italic>.
