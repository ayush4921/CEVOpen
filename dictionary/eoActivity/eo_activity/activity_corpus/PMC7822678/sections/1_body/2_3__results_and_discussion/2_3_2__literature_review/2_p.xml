<p>The literature survey was completed on 31 July 2019 and covered the period of 1960–2019. In total, 634 peer-reviewed publications were reviewed, 53.3% of which were published in journals, and by publishing houses affiliated with the COPE (338 publications). These articles were published in 304 different academic journals, of which 114 are COPE members. A cloud-based literature library was successfully created, first categorizing publications according to the selected plant species mentioned in the paper and subsequently, according to their individual DoPs (“Traditional use,” “Bioactivity,” “Structure elucidation,” and “Other”). Excluding the DoP “Other,” there were a total of 441 field-related original research papers, of which 245 were published by journals with COPE membership (55.6%).</p>
