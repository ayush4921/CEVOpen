<p>These observations partially support the hypothesis that herbs and their associated essential oils may favourably affect hen performance but the number of experimental studies conducted under standardized field conditions with larger numbers of hens and for longer durations, preferably over a whole laying cycle, is still limited (Bozkurt et al., 
 <xref rid="vms3343-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). In the current research, the essential oils did not increase egg production and egg mass, but as numerical, the highest egg production percentage and egg mass were found in LEO group.
