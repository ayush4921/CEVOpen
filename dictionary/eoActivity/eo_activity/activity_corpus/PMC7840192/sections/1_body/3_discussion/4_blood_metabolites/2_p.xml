<p>No significant influence of experimental diets on albumin, uric acid, glucose, triglyceride and cholesterol was observed. There were some changes by addition of MEO, but the changes did not reach statistical significance. The results of this study revealed that LEO and MEO consumption could not change blood variables significantly. Most of spices and herbs enhance the synthesis and excretion of bile acids in the liver. As bile acids had beneficially effects on lipids’ digestion and absorption, it could improve the lipids’ digestion and absorption, which led to increase in the level of blood triglyceride (Srinivasan,
