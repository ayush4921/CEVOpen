<p>The phytogenic feed additives as performance enhancers for laying hens have primarily been supplemented to increase the utilization of the limit‐fed diet and, in turn, improve egg production (Bozkurt et al., 
 <xref rid="vms3343-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). In the current study, supplementing MEO individually or combined with LEO significantly decreased egg production and also egg mass values during 42–46 weeks; in addition, egg weights in MEO and LEO groups were not influenced compared to the control group. Egg production was significantly higher in LEO group compared to MEO and LEO + MEO groups during 42–56 weeks. LEO feeding also significantly increased egg mass compared to MEO group during 42–56 weeks. According to some authors, diets with higher inclusion levels of essential oils compounds had toxic effects (Krishan, &amp; Narang, 
 <xref rid="vms3343-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). In this case, decline in egg production in treatment 4 (LEO + MEO), may be due to the accumulation of the essential oils and its probable toxicity; however, more adequate toxicological study must be carried out to clarify this assumption.
