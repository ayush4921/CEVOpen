<p>Most of findings showed that improving FCR was related to increase in the amount of egg mass; consequently, increase in egg mass might lead to improved FCR (Nobakht et al.,

In a study, the impact of feeding different amounts of eucalyptus (eucalyptus is similar to lavender due to containing cisteol) on productive performance, egg quality, blood variables and immune response in Japanese quails was investigated and it indicated enhanced daily weight gain, number of egg, egg weight, egg mass, improved FCR and quality of egg in the diets with eucalyptus compared to the control diet (Hassan et al., 
 <xref rid="vms3343-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). The results of our experiment are not in accordance with the results of Hassan, et al. that observed increase in egg weight, feed intake and production percentage by using eucalyptus powder in the diets of quails (Hassan et al.,

In another study, applying 3 g of eucalyptus per kilogram of diet improved the laying hens’ productive performance and immunocompetence; moreover, FCR was improved in the hens given 3 g of eucalyptus in the diet because of their health and vitality (Abd El‐Motaal et al.,
