<p>In a research, Al‐Ankari, Zaki and Al‐Sutan found that supplementation of 
 <italic>Mentha piperita</italic> at the level of 1.5% for 35 days showed beneficial results on body weight, feed intake and FCR in broilers (Al‐Ankari, Zaki, &amp; Al‐Sutan, 
 <xref rid="vms3343-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). Similarly, Nobakht, Norany &amp; Safamehr reported that feeding 0.5% dried 
 <italic>Mentha pulegium</italic> resulted in positive effects on performance in broilers at 42 days of age (Nobakht, Norany, &amp; Safamehr, 
 <xref rid="vms3343-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). Whereas, Ocak et al. reported that supplemental 
 <italic>Mentha piperita</italic> (0.2%) had no effects on broilers body weight and FCR at 42 days of age (Ocak et al., 
 <xref rid="vms3343-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). The controversy among these studies might be due to the differences in mint resources, which vary according to species, active ingredient, harvest time, etc (Brenes &amp; Roura,
