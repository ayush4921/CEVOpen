<p>On this basis, we hypothesized that inclusion of 
 <italic>Lavandula angustifolia</italic> and/or 
 <italic>Mentha spicata</italic> into laying hens' diets would be helpful to enhance production performance, egg traits and blood biochemical variables; besides, assessing the probable synergistic interaction between dietary
