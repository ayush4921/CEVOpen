<p>All data obtained from the trials were subjected to the analysis of variance procedure of statistical analysis system (SAS, 
 <xref rid="vms3343-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>, Version 8.02) according to completely randomized design. Means were separated by Duncan's new multiple range test. The level of significance was determined at &lt;.05. The following model was considered for analysis: Y
 <sub>ij</sub> = μ + (R
 <sub>i</sub>) + (C
 <sub>j</sub>) + (RC
 <sub>ij</sub>) + (e
 <sub>ij</sub>), where Y
 <sub>ijk</sub> is the measured characteristic, μ is the overall mean, (R
 <sub>i</sub>) is the main effect of LEO, (C
 <sub>j</sub>) is the main effect of MEO, RC
 <sub>ij</sub> is interaction between the effect of LEO and MEO, and (e
 <sub>ij</sub>) is the residual error. The effects of the main factors were not considered, whenever the interaction was significant.(Figures
