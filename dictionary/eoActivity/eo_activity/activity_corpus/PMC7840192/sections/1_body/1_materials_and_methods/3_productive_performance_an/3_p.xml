<p>Haugh units were calculated from the records of albumen height and egg weight using the HU formula (Eisen, Bohren, &amp; McKean, 
 <xref rid="vms3343-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">1962</xref>). The shell thickness was a mean value of measurement at three locations on the egg (air cell, equator and sharp end) by using a dial and pipe gage. The yolk colour was scored with the aid of Roche Yolk Colour Fan. Yolk height and yolk diameter were measured by a tripod micrometer (Mitutoyo, 0.01 mm) and compass (Swordfish, 0.02 mm), respectively, then the yolk index was calculated. Egg length and width were individually recorded and used to calculate egg shape index.
