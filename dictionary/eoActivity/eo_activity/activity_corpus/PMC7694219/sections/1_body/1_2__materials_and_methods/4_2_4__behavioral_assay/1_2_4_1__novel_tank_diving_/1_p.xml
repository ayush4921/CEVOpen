<p>The NTT is a particular test used to evaluate anxiety in zebrafish, as defined by Cachat et al. [
 <xref rid="B46-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The trapezoidal tank (1.5 L) used measured 15.2 height × 27.9 top × 22.5 bottom × 7.1 width cm, equally divided into two horizontal sections (top and bottom). Following 1 h of TEO treatment, the animals were placed individually within the test tank without acclimatization, and swimming behavior was recorded for 6 min. The animals were recorded with a Logitech HD Webcam C922 Pro Stream camera (Logitech, Lausanne, Switzerland) placed 30 cm away from the tank and the videos were analyzed using ANY-Maze
 <sup>®</sup> software (Stoelting CO, Wood Dale, IL, USA). Representative tracking images of the zebrafish locomotor activity for each group was obtained at the end of the analysis with ANY-Maze
 <sup>®</sup> software. The following parameters heve been recorded: The time spent in the top/bottom zone of the tank (s), total distance traveled (m), and average velocity (m/s).
