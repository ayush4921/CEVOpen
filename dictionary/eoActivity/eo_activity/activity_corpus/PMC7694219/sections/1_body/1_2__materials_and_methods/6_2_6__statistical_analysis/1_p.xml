<p>All results are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (S.E.M) and were analyzed by GraphPad Prism 8.0 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). The normality of data distribution was evaluated using Shapiro-Wilk-Test. Datasets with multiple comparisons were evaluated using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. In the preference experiments within the Y-maze and NOR tests, one sample 
 <italic>t</italic>-test was used for comparison of the preference to chance level (50%). The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) was used to estimate the correlation between the behavioral scores, enzymatic activities, and lipid peroxidation.
