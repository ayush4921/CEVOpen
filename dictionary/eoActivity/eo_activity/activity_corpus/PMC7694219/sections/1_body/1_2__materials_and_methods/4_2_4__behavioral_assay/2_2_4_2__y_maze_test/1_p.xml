<p>Spatial memory and the response to novelty in zebrafish was assessed using the Y-maze task [
 <xref rid="B47-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The location in the Y-maze task was considered to be a memory index [
 <xref rid="B45-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The apparatus consisted in a Y-maze glass tank with three identical arms (25 cm long, 8 cm wide, and 15 cm high), filled with 3 L of the the home aquarium water. The water high in the Y-maze was 13 cm. Explicit geometric shapes (squares, circles, and triangles) were placed on the outer walls and visible from the inside. The Y-maze test consisted in two trials separated by 1 h interval. During the first trial, 1 h after TEO treatment, the fish could freely swim in the start arm and in the other arm for 5 min while the novel arm was blocked by a dividing wall. In the second trial, the wall was removed and the fish could explore for 5 min all three arms including the novel environment constituted by the novel arm. Fish were placed in different arms as starting points and the maze was rotated in each experiment to randomize the maze cues. The water was changed between groups and trials. The behavior was fully analyzed using the ANY-Maze
 <sup>®</sup> software (Stoelting CO, Wood Dale, IL, USA), assessing time spent in each arm (percent of the total time), total distance traveled (m), turn angle (°), and the preference percentages. The preference percentages were calculated as (time of exploration of the novel arm/time of exploration of the start + time of exploration of the other arm + time of exploration of the novel arm × 100).
