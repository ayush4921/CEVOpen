<p>Glutathione peroxidase (GPX, E.C. 1.11.1.9) activity was analyzed as described by Sharma and Gupta [
 <xref rid="B52-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. A reaction mixture consisting of 1 mL 0.4 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.4 mM EDTA, 1 mL of 5 mM NaN
 <sub>3</sub>, 1 mL of 4 mM glutathione (GSH), and 200 μL of supernatant was pre-incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. Then 1 mL of 4 mM H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> was inserted and incubated at 37 °C for a further 5 min. The GSH excess was quantified by the 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB) method. One unit of GPX is defined as the amount of enzyme required to oxidize for 1 nmol GSH/min. The enzyme specific activity was expressed as units/mg protein.
