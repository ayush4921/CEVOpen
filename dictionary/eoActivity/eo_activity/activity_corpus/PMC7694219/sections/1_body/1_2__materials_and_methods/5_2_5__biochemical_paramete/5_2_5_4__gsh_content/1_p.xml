<p>The reduced glutathione (GSH) content was assessed in the zebrafish brain supernatant using the method of Fukuzawa and Tokumura [
 <xref rid="B53-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. 200 µL of brain supernatant was mixed with 1.1 mL of 0.25 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH = 7.4) followed by the addition of 130 µL DTNB 0.04%. Finally, the mixture was fixed to a final volume of 1.5 mL with distilled water, and absorbance was read at 412 nm using a spectrophotometer. The results were presented as µg GSH/µg protein.
