<p>The protein content was estimated through Bradford’s dye-binding assay. 0.8 mL of Roti
 <sup>®</sup> Quant reagent (Carl Roth, Germany) was mixed with up to 200 μL of the sample, and the change in absorbance at 595 nm was measured using a DU
 <sup>®</sup> 740 Life Science spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). A calibration curve in the range of 2 to 20 μg was constructed using bovine serum albumin (BSA). Protein concentration was expressed as μg BSA/μL of clear homogenate [
