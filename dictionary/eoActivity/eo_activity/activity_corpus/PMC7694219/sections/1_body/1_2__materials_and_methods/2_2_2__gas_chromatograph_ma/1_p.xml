<p>To obtain the chromatographic profile of the essential oil a Shimadzu GC-17A Gas Chromatograph (Shimadzu, Milan, Italy) equipped with a 15 m × 0.1 mm × 0.1 mm fused silica capillary column (Supelco SPB
 <sup>TM</sup>-5, Merk KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) and Flame Ionization Detector (FID) was used. GC-MS analyses were performed on a Shimadzu GCMS-QP5050A (Shimadzu, Milan, Italy). The operating conditions for both runs were the following: 60 °C for 1 min, 60–280 °C at 10 °C/min then 280 °C for 1 min; injector temperature 250 °C; detector temperature 280 °C; carrier gas helium (1 mL/min); split mode (1:200), the volume of injection 1 mL (4% essential oil/CH

Mass spectrometer parameters were the following: Ionization at 70 eV, ion source temperature 180 °C. Mass spectral data were acquired in the scan mode in m/z range 40–400. Oil solutions were injected with the split mode (1:96) [
