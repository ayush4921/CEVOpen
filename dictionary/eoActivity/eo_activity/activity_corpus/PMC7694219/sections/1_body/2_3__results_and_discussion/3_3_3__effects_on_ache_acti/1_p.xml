<p>The levels of biochemical markers linked to cholinergic function and oxidative stress were examined to elucidate the underlying mechanism of TEOâ€™s memory enhancement behavior in Sco-treated fish. Dysfunction and loss of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain have been reported to be among the earliest pathological events that occur in AD pathogenesis and are followed by a decline in the frequency of the choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and AChE and acetylcholine (ACh) levels in the brains of people with AD [

 <italic>Thymus</italic> essential oils examined, practically all carvacrol, borneol, or 1,8-cineole rich oils have an inhibitory effect on AChE, indicating that these compounds are important for their bioactivity. Aazza et al. [
 <xref rid="B69-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], demonstrated that TEO exhibited anti-AChE activity mainly due to the presence of the phenolic monoterpenes thymol and carvacrol. Owokotomo et al. [

 <xref rid="B71-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] highlighted the anticholinesterase potential of six
