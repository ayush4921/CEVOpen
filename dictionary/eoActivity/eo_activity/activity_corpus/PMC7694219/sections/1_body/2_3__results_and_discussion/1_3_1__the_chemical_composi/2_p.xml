<p>Our findings are endorsed by Tardugno et al. [
 <xref rid="B62-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], who reported that the main constituents of TEO were thymol (35.84–41.15%), 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (17.50–21.73%), γ-terpinene (15.06–18.42%), linalool (2.55–5.37%), and carvacrol (1.45–1.70%). Csikós et al. [
 <xref rid="B63-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] reported that thymol (46.3%) and 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (22.1%) were identified as the main components of TEO. Rinaldi et al. [
 <xref rid="B64-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] showed the presence of thymol as the most abundant (44.4%) followed by O-cymene (18.2%) and linalool (7.5%) in the chemical composition of TEO. Based on these results, our essential oil shows a chemical composition proportionate to those mentioned by other authors who assume its memory-enhancing and antioxidant function.
