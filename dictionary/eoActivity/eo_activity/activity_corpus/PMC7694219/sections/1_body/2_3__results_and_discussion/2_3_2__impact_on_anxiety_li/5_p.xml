<p>Our results are in line with those recently published by other authors who reported an improvement of cognitive function following the administration of 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris.</italic> Akan et al. [
 <xref rid="B65-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] demonstrated the positive effects of 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> L. and 
 <italic>Thymbra spicata</italic> L. against diabetes mellitus-induced neuropathy and cognitive impairment as assessed by Morris water maze in rats. The authors attributed the observed effects to the presence in high amounts in the essential oil composition of some components such as thymol, carvacrol, 8-terpinene, 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, and 
 <italic>Î±</italic>-pinene. Rabiei et al. [
 <xref rid="B37-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] suggested that the anti-amnesic effect of the 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> extract on Sco-induced memory deficits in rats by using Morris water maze and passive avoidance tests may be related to its antioxidants activity or the mediation of the cholinergic system activity. Again, the authors attributed these effects to carvacrol and thymol as evidenced in the chemical composition. Based on these results, TEO could be considered as an alternative tool for improving cognitive deficits in AD-dementia conditions.
