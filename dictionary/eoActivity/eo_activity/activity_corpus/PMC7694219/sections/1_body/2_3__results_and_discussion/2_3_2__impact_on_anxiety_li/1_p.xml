<p>The NTT assesses the anxiety reaction evoked by novelty. Representative locomotion tracking patterns (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01083-f002">Figure 2</xref>A) shows the variations in swimming traces within the NTT test between the top and the bottom areas. Sco-treated groups displayed a bottom zone preference which indicated high levels of anxiety. In the NTT test, one-way ANOVA revealed significant effect of the treatment on the time spent in the top/bottom zone of the tank (F (4.90) = 32.65,
