<p>There is no treatment for AD. However, there are medications available that can alleviate symptoms temporarily. Currently, only a few medications are available on the market with multiple adverse effects. Donepezil is the second approved AChE inhibitor for the treatment of mild to moderate AD by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), extensively used worldwide [
