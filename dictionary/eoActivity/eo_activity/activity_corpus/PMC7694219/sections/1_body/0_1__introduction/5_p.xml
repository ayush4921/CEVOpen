<p>The chemical composition of the TEO has been documented. Thymol has generally been identified to be the main constituent of 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic>, accompanied by carvacrol and linalool [
 <xref rid="B28-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. These compounds have been stated to have also therapeutic properties (e.g., vs. AD) [
 <xref rid="B29-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. For instance, Asadbegi et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] demonstrated that thymol decreased the effect on memory damage caused by intrahippocampal injection of the Aβ peptide in high-fat diet-fed rats and could be found as neuroprotective. Additionally, Capibaride et al. [
 <xref rid="B31-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], confirmed the marked antidepressant-like effect of thymol, as demonstrated by its ability to reverse chronic corticosterone-associated behavior and a decrease in BDNF levels in female mice. Furthermore, Formiga et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] suggested the intestinal anti-inflammatory function of 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene and rosmarinic acid involving the cytoprotection of the intestinal barrier, the preservation of the mucus layer, and the conservation of communicating junctions, as well as the regulation of the antioxidant and immunomodulatory processes. Azizi et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] demonstrated that the neuroprotective effects of carvacrol and thymol against Aβ25–35 might be through attenuating oxidative damage and increasing the activity of PKC as a memory-related protein. Besides, β-myrcene and caryophyllene within the monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes have been identified as the major compounds. β-myrcene is known to have analgesic, anxiolytic, and anti-inflammatory effects [
 <xref rid="B34-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Caryophyllene was known as an anti-inflammatory compound in some 
 <italic>Cannabis</italic> extracts due to interactions with cannabinoid receptors and gastric cytoprotective activity [
 <xref rid="B36-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Notably, caryophyllene oxide appears to be a multi-target molecule known for its anti-cancer and analgesic properties [
 <xref rid="B35-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].
