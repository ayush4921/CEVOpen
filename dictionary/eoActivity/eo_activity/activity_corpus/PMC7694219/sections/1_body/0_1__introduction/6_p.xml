<p>In zebrafish, the essential oils from 
 <italic>Thymus quinquecostatus</italic> Celak. from the Loess Plateau in China exhibited antioxidant potential mainly by regulating the Nrf2/Keap1 signaling pathway. Rabiei et al. [
 <xref rid="B37-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] reported that 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> extract has remedial on memory and behavioral disturbances caused by Sco and may have beneficial effects in the treatment of AD. Elaissi et al. [
 <xref rid="B38-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] demonstrated antiproliferative activities of 
 <italic>Thymus numidicus</italic> Poir. against two human cancer cell lines: the colonic (HCT116) and breast adenocarcinoma (MCF7), respectively. Butt et al. [
 <xref rid="B39-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] demonstrated that the TEO was found to be a good source of thymoquinone as a chemotherapeutic drug that expressed potent antioxidant and antiproliferative activities. To date, no study indicated the TEO positive effects on memory function in zebrafish against Sco-induced cognitive dysfunction by regulating cholinergic and antioxidant pathways. The present study was therefore organized to examine the phytochemical composition of the TEO and to evaluate the effects on anxiety, cognitive performance, and the brain antioxidant capability in a zebrafish Sco model of amnesia.
