<p>Scopolamine (Sco) is a cholinergic antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors known to interfere with acetylcholine production in the central nervous system. This drug was used as a guide for the induction of amnesia in animal models [

The most important characteristic of dementia is memory deterioration, which may be chemically caused by the use of Sco in laboratory animals. The effect of Sco on memory is followed by central cholinergic dysfunction and oxidative stress in zebrafish [

Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that Sco interferes with the molecular homeostasis of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and cAMP response element-binding (CREB)/brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in animal models [
