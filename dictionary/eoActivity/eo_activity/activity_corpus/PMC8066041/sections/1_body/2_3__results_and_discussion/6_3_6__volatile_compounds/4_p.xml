<p>Among the aldehydes, pentanal was the major compound observed in the cold-pressed PSO and was significantly higher in PSO extracts from blanched and microwave-heated seeds than unpretreated seeds. Pentanal is characterized by a nutty and fruity flavor and has been naturally found in other seed oils such as sesame, olive, and peanut [

 <xref rid="foods-10-00712-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, blanching and microwave pretreatment of seeds may promote the oxidative degradation of the oil. Our results, therefore, indicate higher oxidation liability of oil from pretreated pomegranate seeds compared with unpretreated seeds. The PV, AV, and AnV results found in this study support these findings (
 <xref rid="foods-10-00712-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). While 2-propanone did not significantly differ in all oil samples, other ketones such as 5-butyltetrahydro-2-furanone and 5-butyl-5H-furan-2-one were only detected in oil from pretreated seeds. Saturated fatty acids including hexanoic acid, acetic acid, pentanoic acid, formic acid, and butanoic acid did not significantly (

 <xref rid="B65-foods-10-00712" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. It can be stated that, although seed blanching and microwave heating may augment the positive flavor of cold-pressed PSO, they may also promote the development of undesirable flavors.
