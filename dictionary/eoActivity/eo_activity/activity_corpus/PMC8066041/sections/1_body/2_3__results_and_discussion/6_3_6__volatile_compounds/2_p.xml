<p>Esters, which are derived from the esterification of free fatty acids and alcohols, occur naturally in many fruits and enhance their flavors. Pentyl pentanoate, the only ester observed in the oil samples, was significantly higher in oil from blanched and microwaved seeds (10- and 1.5-fold, respectively) than in unpretreated seeds, suggesting that blanching and microwaving the seeds can enhance the oil flavor [

 <xref rid="B62-foods-10-00712" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] also reported the enhancement of ester compounds in rapeseed oil after microwave pretreatment of the seeds. In addition, blanching and microwave heating of seeds may induce heterocyclic compounds through the Maillard reaction, which enhances the positive flavors. Furan and its derivatives belong to heterocyclic compounds and correlate with the flavor of foods [
