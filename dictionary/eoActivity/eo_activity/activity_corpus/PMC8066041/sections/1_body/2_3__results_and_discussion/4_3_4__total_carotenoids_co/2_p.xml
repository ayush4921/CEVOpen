<p>The total phenolic contents of PSO from unpretreated, blanched, and microwave-heated seeds are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00712-f002">Figure 2</xref>b. Blanching and microwave heating of pomegranate seeds significantly improved the TPC of cold-pressed oil by 21 and 37%, respectively. The findings suggest that blanching and microwaving of seeds facilitated the dissociation of glycosylated and esterified phenolic compounds, enhancing the amount of free phenolic compounds available for extraction [

 <xref rid="B20-foods-10-00712" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and Lee et al. [
 <xref rid="B36-foods-10-00712" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], who also reported improvement in TPC of cold-pressed black cumin and perilla seed oils after seed microwave and steam pretreatments, respectively. The levels of TPC from blanched and microwaved seeds did not significantly differ (

 <xref rid="B52-foods-10-00712" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] reported TPC ranging from 0.03 to 0.07 mgGAE/g PSO, the TPC values in the current study varied from 1.33 to 1.83 mgGAE/g PSO (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00712-f002">Figure 2</xref>b). Among other factors, the observed variation could be due to the selective nature of solvent extraction towards the phenolic compounds, hence the lower TPC values compared to the cold-pressed oil. On the contrary, Khoddami et al. [
 <xref rid="B7-foods-10-00712" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] cold pressed oil from three different pomegranate cultivars and reported TPC values ranging from 8.52 to 10.44 mgGAE/g PSO that were 5.7 to 6.4 times higher than our results. These dissimilarities highlight the importance of preharvest and processing factors consideration in PSO processing and quality.
