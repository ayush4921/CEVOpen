<p>While the consumption of foods rich in carotenoids has been strongly linked to the reduction in incidences of diseases such as cancers, cardiovascular diseases, age-related macular degeneration, and cataracts, these thermolabile antioxidant compounds might be affected by processing [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00712-f002">Figure 2</xref>a, TCC significantly decreased (32%) after pomegranate seed blanching. Nevertheless, it was not significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) affected by seed microwave heating. The decrease in TCC after seed blanching could be explained by the breakdown of carotenoid molecules through isomerization and thermal oxidation [
 <xref rid="B20-foods-10-00712" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. These values were higher than TCC values reported in previous studies. For example, Costa et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-foods-10-00712" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] reported TCC values ranging between 0.010 and 0.015 mg β-carotene/g PSO. Moreover, other studies failed to detect carotenoids in PSO [
 <xref rid="B5-foods-10-00712" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The variation in the results could be due to dissimilarities in cultivars, fruit maturity, geographical location, and oil extraction process, among other factors [

 <xref rid="B48-foods-10-00712" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The TCC from other fruit seeds such as passion fruit and sour cherry ranged between 0.01 and 1.20 mg β-carotene/g oil [

 <xref rid="B50-foods-10-00712" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The large disparity in the TCC of oil from different fruit seeds could reflect differences in the sensitivity of the methods of analysis, and it is, therefore, suggested that TCC calculated from the sum of individual carotenoids could be more reliable.
