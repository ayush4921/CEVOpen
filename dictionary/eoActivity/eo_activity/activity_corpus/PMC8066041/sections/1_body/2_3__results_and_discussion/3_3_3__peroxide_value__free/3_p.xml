<p>The ρ-anisidine value measures the aldehyde and ketonic breakdown products of peroxides. These secondary products of oxidation are responsible for the development of rancidity in oils and fats. As shown in 
 <xref rid="foods-10-00712-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, the AnV of PSO from unpretreated, blanched, and microwave-heated seeds were 1.97, 2.71, and 3.02, respectively, which were 6 to 7 times lower than those reported by Costa et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-foods-10-00712" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The result that microwave heating of seeds significantly increased the AV of PSO by 53% while blanching had an insignificant effect on AV indicates the difference in the pretreatment methods’ mode of action. Despite the unavailability of an internationally recognized seed oil quality standard on AnV, there is a general agreement among researchers that for seed oil to be still acceptable, the AnV should be less than 10 [
