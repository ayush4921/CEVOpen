<p>The refractive index is often applied to identify and characterize food materials, including seed oil. The relationships between RI and fatty acid chain length as well as the degree of unsaturation have been reported [
 <xref rid="B41-foods-10-00712" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The refractive index of the oil did not significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) change after seed pretreatment, regardless of the significant change in fatty acid content after seed microwave pretreatment. In this sense, the interpretation of RI results in the present study should be made with caution. The RI narrowly ranged between 1.5194 and 1.5197, values typical of PSO and indicative of its high unsaturation (
