<p>Oil yield is an essential factor in maximizing the gross income for seed oil processers. In this regard, pretreatment of the oleaginous material is crucial in promoting oil release from the seed matrix. The results in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00712-f001">Figure 1</xref> show that blanching and microwave heating of seeds enhanced the PSO yield (55 and 91%, respectively), with blanched seeds exhibiting a significantly higher oil yield (6.12%) than microwave-heated seeds (4.97%). The initial yield of PSO from unpretreated seeds was 3.20%. The finding that blanching and microwave heating of seeds significantly improved the PSO yield could be attributed to altering the pomegranate seed cellular structures, which increased the permeability of the cell walls and mass transfer of lipids during pressing [

 <xref rid="B36-foods-10-00712" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] observed a 2.3- to 2.4-fold increase in cold-pressed perilla seed oil yield after steam pretreatment of the seeds. On the other hand, in the absence of seed pretreatment, which provides cell disintegration, the permeability of the pomegranate seed to oil could have been limited, hence the lower oil yield from unpretreated seeds (

 <xref rid="B7-foods-10-00712" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], a fact that could be explained by differences in seed variety, moisture content, oil press equipment, fruit maturity, and geographical location, among other factors.
