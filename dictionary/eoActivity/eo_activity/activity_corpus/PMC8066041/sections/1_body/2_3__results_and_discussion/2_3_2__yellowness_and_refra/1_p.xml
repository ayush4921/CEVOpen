<p>The color and appearance of foods, including seed oil, constitute the first set of sensory attributes and therefore affect the consumer perception of quality. The color of food may be attributed to natural pigments or biochemical or chemical products developed during processing such as seed thermal pretreatment [

 <xref rid="foods-10-00712-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> depicts the changes in the PSO yellowness index due to seed blanching and microwave heating. Blanching and microwave heating of PS significantly decreased the oil YI by 7%. With respect to PSO from blanched seeds, the decrease in the YI could be ascribed to the reduction in total carotenoids content due to the conversion of trans-carotenoids, which are the usual configuration, to cis-isomers, hence decreasing the oil yellowness (

 <xref rid="B40-foods-10-00712" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], the extensive conjugated and trans-configured double bond system in carotenoids absorbs light in the visible region and provides foods such as seed oil with color. The pomegranate seed oil YI ranged from 37.30 to 40.21 and was lower than the one observed by Khoddami et al. [
