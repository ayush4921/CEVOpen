<p>Free fatty acids and the acid value may be used to indicate lipase activity in the seed oil [
 <xref rid="B7-foods-10-00712" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In this sense, higher FFA and AV in seed oil indicate a higher magnitude of hydrolytic deterioration and lower-quality oil product. As shown in 
 <xref rid="foods-10-00712-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, PSO from blanched and microwave-heated seeds had a relatively higher FFA and AV than PSO from unpretreated seeds. The increase in FFA and AV after seed blanching and microwave heating ranged between 7 and 54%. According to the quality requirements as recommended by the Codex Alimentarius Commission, cold-pressed oils should have a maximum of 4.0 mg KOH/g oil of AV [

 <xref rid="foods-10-00712-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The FFA (0.60–0.92%) in the present study were lower than those reported in previous studies. For instance, Khoddami et al. [
 <xref rid="B7-foods-10-00712" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] reported FFA values of cold-pressed PSO ranging from 0.65 to 1.39%, which were 1.1- to 1.5-fold higher than our results.
