<p>Moreover, other furans including 2-pentylfuran and 2-butylfuran were only detected in oil from blanched and microwaved seeds. This phenomenon indicates that the flavor of PSO may be improved by blanching and microwave pretreatment of seeds. Pentanol, the primary alcohol observed, was 25 to 27% higher in PSO from blanched seeds than microwave-heated and unpretreated seeds (

Other alcohol compounds observed in lower concentrations such as ethanol and octanol were not significantly affected by seed blanching and microwave heating. Alcohols have also been reported in previous studies as important contributors to seed oil flavor [
