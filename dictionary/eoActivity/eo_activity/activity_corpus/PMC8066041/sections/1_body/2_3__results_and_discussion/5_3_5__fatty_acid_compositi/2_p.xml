<p>Regarding total saturated fatty acids (SFA), blanching and microwave heating of seeds significantly increased the SFA by 9 and 18%, respectively. A 9% decrease in total monosaturated fatty acids (MUFA) was observed in PSO from blanched seeds, and this could be due to the significant decrease (7-fold) in docosenoic acid. No significant (

After seed microwave pretreatment, the level significantly decreased by 6%, whilst it insignificantly decreased in PSO from blanched seeds, indicating increased heat penetration and oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids during seed microwave heating (

The finding implies that seed pretreatment did not affect the balance between the monosaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. However, the unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) to SFA index decreased after seed pretreatment, which could be explained by the significant increase in SFA after seed pretreatment.
