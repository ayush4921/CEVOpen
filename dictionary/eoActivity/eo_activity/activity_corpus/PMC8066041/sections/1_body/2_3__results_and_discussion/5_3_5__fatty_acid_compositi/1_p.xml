<p>Fatty acid composition is one of the most critical quality characteristics of oilseeds, considering that the suitability of the oil for food, nutraceutical, or pharmaceutical applications may be governed by the type of fatty acids. 
 <xref rid="foods-10-00712-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows the fatty acid composition of cold-pressed PSO from unpretreated, blanched, and microwaved seeds. Chromatograms of FAMES for the treatments are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-foods-10-00712">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>. Ten different types of fatty acids were identified in PSO, with palmitic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, and punicic acid being the primary fatty acids and representing 7.73–9.22%, 9.53–10.48%, 15.93–17.11%, and 54.12–58.32% of the total composition, respectively. Other fatty acids identified but in minor quantities (0.06–4.32%) were arachidic acid, stearic acid, heneicosanoic acid, docosanoic acid, docosenoic acid, and linolenic acid. Generally, thermal pretreatment of oilseeds may alter the fatty acids composition due to the sensitivity of polyunsaturated fatty acids [

 <xref rid="B21-foods-10-00712" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] observed a 14 and 11% decrease in punicic acid after pomegranate seed roasting (150 °C for 10 min) and microwave heating (750 W for 7.5 min), respectively. Considering that punicic acid is implicated in most PSO biochemical properties, the decrease in punicic acid after microwave heating of the seeds in the current study was not desirable. Although punicic acid has been reported in other seeds such as bitter gourd [
 <xref rid="B6-foods-10-00712" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], pomegranate seed remains the major source of this bioactive lipid. Compared to the literature, the levels of punicic acid (54.12–58.32%) in the current study are comparable to those reported by Costa et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-foods-10-00712" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] (55.24–60.62%) from cold-pressed PSO. Nevertheless, some previous studies on cold-pressed PSO reported values that were higher (75.23–78.23%) than in the present study [

 <xref rid="B57-foods-10-00712" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The dissimilarities in the punicic acid content could be ascribed to variation in processing techniques and pomegranate cultivars, among other factors. Linoleic acid and γ-linolenic acid, essential fatty acids, significantly increased by 1.1- and 3.4-fold after microwaving the pomegranate seed, whilst the blanching of the seeds did not significantly change the respective fatty acids. This indicates differences in microwaving and blanching modes of action and their impact on the fatty acids. Owing to the absence of appropriate enzymes, the human body cannot synthesize these essential fatty acids, and therefore their maximum extraction from oilseeds is essential [
 <xref rid="B58-foods-10-00712" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Oleic acid, the major monosaturated fatty acid in PSO, insignificantly varied from 9.68% to 9.53% and 10.48% after blanching and microwave heating the seeds, respectively (
 <xref rid="foods-10-00712-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Although the concentration of palmitic acid and arachidic acid, the main saturated fatty acids, increased between 1.4 and 19% and 42 and 43%, respectively, after seed blanching and microwave heating, the levels of stearic acid, heneicosanoic acid, and docosanoic acid were not significantly changed by seed pretreatment. The insignificant effect of seed thermal pretreatment on some fatty acids has also been reported in prior research [
