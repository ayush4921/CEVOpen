<p>The PV is used as the quantity measurement for peroxides, which are intermediate products of lipid oxidation. The PV test is a good way to determine the amount of primary oxidation products in freshly extracted seed oil. The PV of cold-pressed PSO from unpretreated seeds was relatively low (0.73 meqO
 <sub>2</sub>/kg PSO). After seed blanching and microwave heating, the PV significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) increased by 11 and 18%, although no significant differences were observed between the PV of oils extracted from microwave-heated and blanched seeds (

 <sub>2</sub>/kg PSO) from all oil samples were far below the level (15 meqO
 <sub>2</sub>/kg oil) established by the World Health Organization (WHO) under the Codex Alimentarius Commission, indicating that the oils were of good quality and acceptable at the international market [
