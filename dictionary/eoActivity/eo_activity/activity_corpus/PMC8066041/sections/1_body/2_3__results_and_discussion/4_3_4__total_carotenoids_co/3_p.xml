<p>The antiradical radical activity of PSO was determined using the DPPH and ABTS assays. The DPPH radical scavenging activity of the cold-pressed PSO from unpretreated, blanched, and microwaved seeds is given in

Despite the insignificant effect of seed microwave pretreatment on the DPPH radical scavenging activity of the oil, previous studies on purslane and rape seed have shown increased DPPH radical scavenging activity in cold-pressed oil after seed microwave heating [

It is nevertheless noteworthy that seed physical and cellular structures that vary among different types of seeds and cultivars play a vital role in the efficiency of seed pretreatment, cold pressing, and recovery of the antioxidant compounds. Considering that antioxidant properties of oil have a major effect on its oxidative stability behavior, the PSO from blanched seeds might exhibit better stability and improved shelf life. The ABTS radical scavenging activity of the oil samples ranged between 10.95 and 11.55 mmol Trolox/g PSO, with oil from microwaved seeds exhibiting significantly higher ABTS scavenging activity than oil from blanched and unpretreated seeds (3 and 5%, respectively). The variation in the oil samples’ (microwaved and blanched seeds) DPPH and ABTS radicals scavenging suggests that the antioxidant compounds react differently with the different radicals, due to factors such as synergism [

The high ABTS scavenging activity (10.95–11.55 mmol Trolox/g PSO) in the present study could be attributed to the high levels of phenols in the cold-pressed oils and their synergistic effect with other antioxidant compounds such as tocopherols, which are also abundantly found in PSO [
