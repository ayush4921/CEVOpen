<p>The total oxidation value of PSO was determined using the PV and AnV values, representing the information for primary and secondary oxidation products. Therefore, the TOTOX value indicates both the oxidation history and further oxidation potential of the oils [

 <xref rid="foods-10-00712-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The TOTOX value for PSO from unpretreated seeds was 3.42, which significantly increased to 4.33 and 4.74 after seed blanching and microwave heating, respectively. The results suggest that blanching and microwave heating of seeds could have promoted lipase enzyme activity and hydrolytic oxidation of the oil. The literature has reported increased activity of lipolytic enzymes on fat and oil in damaged cells [
