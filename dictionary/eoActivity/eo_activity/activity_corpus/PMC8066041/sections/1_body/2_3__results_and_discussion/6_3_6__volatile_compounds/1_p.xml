 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-foods-10-00712">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>. Volatile compounds that can be perceived by humans have a greater influence on PSO flavor. These are the primary volatile flavor substances and constitute the characteristic flavor of PSO. The PSO samples showed varied volatile compounds belonging to the following chemical classes: alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, esters, carboxylic acids, and hydrocarbons. The groups of volatile compounds were comparable to the findings of Costa et al. [
