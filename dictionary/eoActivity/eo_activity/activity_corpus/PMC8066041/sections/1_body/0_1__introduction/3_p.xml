<p>Seed oil extraction by cold pressing is the most preferred by processors and consumers because of the low production costs and high concentration of bioactive compounds such as essential fatty acids, tocopherols, phenols, carotenoids, and phytosterols in the oil [

Cold-pressed oils are obtained mechanically using either a hydraulic or screw press without the application of heat, solvents, or chemical treatments, which makes the process environmentally friendly and the extracted oil safer for human consumption [
 <xref rid="B12-foods-10-00712" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Therefore, there is a growing demand for cold-pressed oil, such as cold-pressed pomegranate seed oil. The maximum temperature of cold-pressed oil should not exceed 50 Â°C [
