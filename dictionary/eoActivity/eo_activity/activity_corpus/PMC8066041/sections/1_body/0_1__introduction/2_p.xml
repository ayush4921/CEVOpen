<p>The literature has shown that every part of the fruit contains compounds with health benefits. The juice and peels contain punicalagins, hydrolyzable tannins, anthocyanins, and ellagic acid [

Further, processing the seeds into specialty oil is a profitable alternative to managing the postharvest waste from pomegranate fruit processing. Pomegranate seed oil can be extracted from the seeds using various techniques such as cold pressing and solvent, supercritical carbon dioxide, and ultrasound-assisted aqueous enzymatic extraction [
