<p>On the other hand, blanching and microwave heating of seeds decreased the pomegranate seed oilâ€™s yellowness index, whilst the refractive index was not significantly affected. Although both blanching and microwave pretreatment of seeds added value to the cold-pressed PSO, the oil extracted from blanched seeds exhibited lower oxidation indices. The finding affirms that the processing technique is one of the important seed oil quality determinants. Microwave pretreatment of seeds before cold pressing significantly increased palmitic acid, oleic acid, and linoleic acid, whilst it decreased the level of punicic acid, highlighting increased heat penetration and oxidation of the conjugated fatty acid. On the contrary, blanching of seeds did not significantly affect the fatty acid composition of PSO, an indication that the nutritional quality of the oil was not significantly affected. In conclusion, blanching of seeds is a practical step that could be incorporated into mechanical production of PSO.</p>
