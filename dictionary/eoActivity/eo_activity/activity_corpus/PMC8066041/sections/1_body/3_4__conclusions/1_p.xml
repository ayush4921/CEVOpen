<p>In the current study, the effect of blanching and microwave pretreatment of seeds on the quality of cold-pressed PSO was investigated. Blanching and microwave pretreatment of seeds prior to pressing improved oil yield, total phenolic content, flavor compounds, and DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging capacity. The findings are desirable to pomegranate seed oil processors and consumers along the value chain, given that cold pressing is also a greener and safer technology compared to the use of solvents such as hexane. The levels of oxidation indices including the peroxide value, free fatty acids, acid value, œÅ-anisidine value, and total oxidation value also increased. Nevertheless, the oil quality conformed to the requirements of the Codex Alimentarius Commission standard (CODEX STAN 19-1981) on cold-pressed vegetable oils.</p>
