<p>The method described by Ranjith et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-foods-10-00712" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] was used to determine total carotenoids content (TCC). PSO (0.2 g) was dissolved in hexane (5 mL) and 0.5 mL sodium chloride (NaCl) (0.5%, 
 <italic>w/w</italic>) and thoroughly vortexed before being centrifuged (Centrifuge 5810R, Eppendorf, Horsholm, Germany) at 4000 rpm for 5 min. The absorbance was measured at 460 nm using a UV spectrophotometer (Spectrum Instruments, United Scientific, Cape Town, South Africa), and the results were expressed as mgβ-carotene/g of PSO. The Folin–Ciocalteu method was applied to evaluate the total phenolic content (TPC) [
 <xref rid="B28-foods-10-00712" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Briefly, 200 µL of PSO methanol extracts, 250 µL of the Folin–Ciocalteau reagent, 750 µL of 2% (
 <italic>w/v</italic>) sodium carbonate, and 3 mL of distilled water were sequentially mixed, and the mixtures were vortexed and incubated in the dark for 40 min. The absorbances were measured at 760 nm using a UV spectrophotometer (Spectrum Instruments, United Scientific, Cape Town, South Africa), and the results were reported as milligram gallic acid equivalent per g PSO (mg GAE/g PSO).
