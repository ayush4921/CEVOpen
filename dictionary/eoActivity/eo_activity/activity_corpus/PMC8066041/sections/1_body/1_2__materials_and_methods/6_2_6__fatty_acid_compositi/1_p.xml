<p>The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method was used to determine the PSO fatty acid composition [
 <xref rid="B31-foods-10-00712" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. PSO (0.1 g), 2.0 mL hexane, 50 µL heptadecanoic acid (1000 ppm, internal standard), and 1.0 mL of 20% (
 <italic>v/v</italic>) H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> in methanol were sequentially mixed, vortexed, and incubated at 80 °C for 1 h in an oven. To the cooled samples, 3 mL of saturated NaCl was added, and the mixture was further vortexed before centrifugation (Centrifuge 5810R, Eppendorf, Horsholm, Germany) at 4000 rpm for 3 min. The supernatant (hexane extract) was analyzed using a gas chromatograph (6890N, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) coupled to a flame ionization detector (FID). The fatty acid methyl esters were separated on a polar RT-2560 (100 m, 0.25 mm ID, 0.20 µm film thickness) (Restek, Bellefonte, PA, USA) capillary column and helium (1 mL/min) was used as the carrier gas. The sample (1µL) was injected in a 5:1 split ratio and at 240 °C. The oven temperature was programmed as 60 °C/min and increased to 120 °C at a rate of 8 °C/min, then to 245 °C at 1.5 °C/min, and finally to 250 °C at 20 °C/min for 2 min. Gas-chromatographic peaks of FAME were identified by comparison with a commercial mixture of standards, and the NIST library was used to identify the pomegranate seed oil fatty acids profiles. The relative content (%) of each fatty acid was calculated by dividing the peak area of each fatty acid by the total peak area of all the fatty acids identified.
