<p>Volatile compounds were analyzed by HS-SPME-GC-MS [
 <xref rid="B32-foods-10-00712" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. One thousand microliters of oil samples was put in 20 mL SPME vials and 1 µL was injected into the SPME-GC-MS system. Separation was performed on a gas chromatograph (6890N, Agilent technologies network) coupled to an Agilent technologies inert XL EI/CI Mass Selective Detector (MSD) (5975B, Agilent Technologies Inc., Palo Alto, CA). The GC-MS system was coupled to a CTC Analytics PAL autosampler. Separation of the oil volatiles was performed on a ZBWaxPlus (30 m, 0.25 mm ID, 0.25 µm film thickness) capillary column. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The injector temperature was maintained at 250 °C. Injection was performed in splitless mode. The oven temperature was programmed as follows: 35 °C for 5 min, followed by a ramping rate of 5 °C/min until 50 °C and held for 3 min, ramped again at a rate of 5 °C/min until 120 °C and held for 3 min, and finally ramped up to 240 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min for 3 min. The MSD was operated in a full scan mode, and the source and quad temperatures were maintained at 230 °C and 150 °C, respectively. The transfer line temperature was maintained at 250 °C. The mass spectrometer was operated under electron impact (EI) mode at an ionization energy of 70 eV, scanning from 25 to 650 m/z. Compound identification was based on mass spectral data of samples with the standard NIST and Wiley Library and with the comparison of retention indices. The relative content (%) of each volatile compound was calculated by dividing the peak area of each component by the total peak area of all the compounds identified.
