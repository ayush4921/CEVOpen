<p>PS (250 g) were pressed using a single-screw press (Farmet UNO, Ceska Skalice, Czech Republic) equipped with a 10 mm diameter die. The capacity of the expeller press is about 8–12 kg seed/h. The press head was heated to 60 ± 5 °C before oil pressing using a removable heating element, and the temperature of the outflowing oil was 50 ± 5 °C. Temperature was measured using a type-K thermocouple connected to a digital temperature sensor (KIMO Instruments, Wilmington, NC, USA). The pressed oil was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min (Centrifuge 5810R, Eppendorf, Horsholm, Germany) to remove solid particles. Pomegranate seed oil (PSO) extraction yield was defined as gram per hundred gram of pomegranate seed (g/100 g seed). The oil samples were packed in brown bottles and stored at −20 °C before further analyses to minimize oxidation.</p>
