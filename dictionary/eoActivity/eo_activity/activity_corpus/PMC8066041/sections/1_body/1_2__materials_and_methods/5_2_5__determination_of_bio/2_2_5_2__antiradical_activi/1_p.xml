<p>The PSO antiradical activity was evaluated using 2.2-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) and 2.2-diphenyl-1-picryl hydrazyl (DPPH) assays. Briefly, ABTS radical cation (ABTS
 <sup>+</sup>) stock solution, prepared by mixing equal volumes of 2.2-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) solution (7.4 mM) and potassium persulfate solution (2.6 mM), was kept in the dark for 12–16 h. The absorbance was adjusted to 0.7 ± 0.02 at 750 nm after the incubation period, using 80% (
 <italic>v/v</italic>) methanol [
 <xref rid="B29-foods-10-00712" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Three hundred microliters of methanol PSO extracts were mixed with 300 µL of the freshly prepared ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> solution and the samples were incubated for 10 min in the dark. The absorbances of the samples were measured at 750 nm using a microplate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Shanghai, China). The results were reported as mmol Trolox/g of PSO.
