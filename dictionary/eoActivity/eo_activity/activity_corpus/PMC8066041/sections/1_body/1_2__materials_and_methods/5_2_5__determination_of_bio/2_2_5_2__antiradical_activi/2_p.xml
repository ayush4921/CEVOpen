<p>The method described by Siano et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-foods-10-00712" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] was used to determine the DPPH radical scavenging capacity of PSO. Aliquots of 200 ÂµL of methanol PSO extracts were added to 2.5 mL of 0.04% (
 <italic>w/v</italic>) DPPH in 80% (
 <italic>v/v</italic>) methanol and vortexed before incubation in the dark for 60 min. The absorbance was measured using a UV spectrophotometer (Spectrum Instruments, United Scientific, Cape Town, South Africa) at 517 nm. Results were expressed as mmol Trolox/g of PSO.
