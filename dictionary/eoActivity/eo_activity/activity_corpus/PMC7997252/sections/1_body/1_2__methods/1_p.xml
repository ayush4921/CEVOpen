<p>For the review, we conducted a search of PubMed Central, Scopus and Google scholar databases of articles published from 2000 to 2020 to include the most recent literature. The search was limited to articles in English and abstracts were reviewed for relevance to the subject matter of pharmacological perspective on Artemisia. Articles containing combinations of MeSH terms ‘Artemisia’ ‘artemisinin’, ‘artesunate’, ‘phytochemistry’, ‘diseases or conditions’, ‘in vitro or in vivo experiments’, ‘COVID-19′, ‘SARS-CoV-2′ and ‘mechanistic actions’ were collected. Boolean terms (AND/OR/NOT) were added to combine or exclude keywords in the search resulting in more focused literature. </p>
