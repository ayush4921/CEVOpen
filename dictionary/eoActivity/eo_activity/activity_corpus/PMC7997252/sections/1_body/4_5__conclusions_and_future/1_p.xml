 <xref rid="B104-medicina-57-00217" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. Studies comparing the action of whole plant extracts to the action of purified preparation show that, in many cases, the potency of the purified preparation declines at each step of fractionation [
 <xref rid="B105-medicina-57-00217" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Since the therapeutic effect may be the result of the combination of several compounds present in the medicinal plant, a complex mixture of compounds has a greater effect than isolated compounds [
