<p>Several investigators have now shown that extracts from different species of Artemisia are active against SARS-CoV-2 [

 <xref rid="B91-medicina-57-00217" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Results from recent studies indicate that ARTs impair SARS-CoV-2 viral infection by modulating several host cell metabolic pathways thus making them attractive candidates for COVID-19 [

 <xref rid="B92-medicina-57-00217" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. The mechanism of antiviral activity may be through the induction of cellular ROS, blunting the PI3K/Akt/p70S6K signaling pathway, binding to NF-ÎºB/Sp1 or inducing a endocytosis inhibition mechanism, all of which lead to inhibition of viral replication and growth [

 <xref rid="B94-medicina-57-00217" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. The above mentioned results have spurred the interest of few groups to embark on clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ARTs in the treatment of subjects with SARS-CoV-2 viral infection.
