<p>One particular plant that has garnered a lot of attention in lieu of the COVID-19 epidemic is Artemisia which is one of the largest and most widely distributed genera of the family Astraceae (Compositae) [

 <xref rid="B11-medicina-57-00217" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Evidence-based in vitro and in vivo studies on several species of Artemisia resulted in the identification of numerous phytochemicals with varied pharmacological activities, including terpenoids, flavonoids, coumarins, caffeoylquinic acids and sterols [

 <xref rid="B13-medicina-57-00217" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The first clinical trial of Artemisia extract in human patients with malaria was conducted in August 1972. Following that trial, the active compound in the Artemisia extract was isolated and identified as artemisinin. Several derivatives or synthetic compounds with key structures similar to artemisinin have now been developed including artesunate and piperaquine from

 <italic>A. judaica</italic> that have potent antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities [

 <xref rid="B16-medicina-57-00217" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. A combination of artemisinin and its derivatives (ARTs) is now recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the treatment of malaria.
