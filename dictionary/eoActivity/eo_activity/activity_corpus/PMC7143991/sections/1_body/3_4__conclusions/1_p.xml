<p>We compared the levels of major polysaccharides and three triterpenoids in cultured mycelia and cultivated sclerotium of 
 <italic>P. cocos</italic>. We also determined the monosaccharide composition of the different kinds of polysaccharide. According to our results, the contents of WPS and APS in fermented mycelia were 4.02 and 0.08 times that in cultivated sclerotium. Besides, all the crude polysaccharides from mycelia contained a higher ratio of mannose and galactose. Most obviously, only EPS in fermentation media contained glucuronic acid (16.94%) The total triterpenoid content in cultured mycelia was 9.98 times that of cultivated sclerotium. Furthermore, GC/MS analysis results showed that the major fragrance components in common were linalool and methyl phenylacetate. Considering the biosynthetic pathway of terpenes, a possible strategy for improving the yield of triterpenoids in 
 <italic>P. cocos</italic> fermentation was proposed. In summary, fermentation is an attractive alternative method for producing 
 <italic>P. cocos</italic> mycelia and useful secondary metabolites including polysaccharides, triterpenoids, and essential oil. Further activity assay will provide more useful information for their potential application.
