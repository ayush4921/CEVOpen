 <italic>P. cocos</italic> sclerotium was collected fresh from a cultivation base located in Luotian country, Hubei Province, in September 2013 for fungus strain isolation and October 2018 for comparative content determination, and these were authorized by Prof. Yuan Jiu-zhi in Shenyang Pharmaceutical University. The specimen is stored in the Herbarium of Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, with voucher number SPU-f201309-013 and SPU-f201810-015. Sterilized 
 <italic>P. cocos</italic> sclerotium was inoculated onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) media for 3 days, and growing mycelia were picked up using sterile toothpicks and inoculated onto new PDA plates. Purified 
 <italic>P. cocos</italic> mycelia were maintained on PDA plates. To create a seed culture, mycelia covering an area of 1 cm
 <sup>2</sup> were cut from the plates and inoculated into 200 mL of liquid media in Erlenmeyer flasks for 10 days. Then, the seed culture was inoculated into 200 mL of new media in Erlenmeyer flasks at a ratio of 1:50 (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>). These flasks were incubated at 25 Â°C with shaking at 130 rpm for 17 days. The liquid culture medium was potato dextrose broth supplemented with 0.04 g/L vitamin B
 <sub>1</sub> and 5 mL/L corn liquor.
