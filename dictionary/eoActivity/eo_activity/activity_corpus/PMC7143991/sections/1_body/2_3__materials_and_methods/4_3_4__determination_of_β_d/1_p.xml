 <sc>d</sc>-glucose was dissolved in distilled water and further diluted to create a series of solutions of known concentration. A490 (X) was recorded after performing the phenol–sulfuric acid assay and was used with the known glucose quantity (μg) (Y) for linear regression analysis to obtain the standard curve. The different polysaccharide fractions from mycelia and cultivated sclerotium were dissolved in distilled water or 1 M NaOH solution and subjected to the phenol–sulfuric acid assay. The A490 was recorded, and the equivalent glucose concentration was calculated from the standard curve. The standard formula was Y = 0.0089X + 0.0224 (R2 = 0.9981), with a linear range of 6.74–80.88 μg. The addition of 1 M NaOH had no significant effect on the results (data not shown).
