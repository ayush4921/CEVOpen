<p>Cultured mycelia were filtered through a stainless steel sieve (100 meshes), washed with distilled water three times, then lyophilized, weighed, and recorded as biomass. The first filtrate was collected, and four volumes of 95% ethanol were added. The precipitated polysaccharides were collected by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 min and then washed sequentially with anhydrous ethanol, acetone, and diethyl ether. This fraction was named EPS. For the preparation of WPS, the dried mycelia or dried cultivated sclerotium were extracted three times with water by sonication for 30 min to obtain the WPS fraction. The debris after WPS extraction was extracted 30 times with 1 M NaOH solution under sonication for 30 min to obtain the APS fraction. The WPS and APS solutions were subsequently adjusted to 80% ethanol, and the precipitates were collected and dried as mentioned above.</p>
