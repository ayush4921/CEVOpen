<p>A sample (30 mg) of dried mycelium powder or cultivated sclerotium of 
 <italic>P. cocos</italic> was extracted using 1 mL of methanol under sonication for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.45 μm Millipore filter. Samples were analyzed with Dikma Platisil ODS columns (250 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) at 30 °C with ACN/0.5% phosphate solution (70/30) as the mobile phase. The detection wavelength was 242 nm and the flow rate was 1.0 mL/min. The HPLC chromatogram of the standards used and the sample extract are shown in
