<p>The monosaccharide composition of the polysaccharide samples was analyzed using 1-phenyl-3-methyl-5-pyrazolone (PMP) pre-column derivatization as described [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-01269" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. A sample of polysaccharide (15.0–20.0 mg) was dissolved in 2 M trifluoroacetic acid (2.0 mL) in a 10 mL ampoule. The ampoule was sealed in a nitrogen atmosphere and incubated for 8 h in an oven at 110 °C. Following incubation, the ampoule was cooled to room temperature. Then, the reaction mixture was neutralized to pH 7 with 2 M NaOH. Then, the mixture was brought to 10 mL and filtered through a 0.45 μm Millipore filter. The filtrate was retained for PMP determination.
