<p>Fermentation media (400 mL) was subjected to vacuum evaporation at 45 °C, and the distilled water fraction was extracted with 80 mL of hexane three times. The hexane fraction was combined and dried by the addition of 1 g of anhydrous Na

 <sub>4</sub>; then, it was concentrated at reduced pressure until all the hexane was recycled. The total yield of essential oil was 1.2 mL. For the essential oil from the external layer of fresh 
 <italic>P. cocos</italic>, 300 g of fresh external layer was extracted with distilled water using the distillation method according to the description in the China Pharmacopeia 2015 to obtain 0.28 mL of essential oil. The essential oil obtained was dried by the addition of anhydrous Na
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>. Then, 0.2 mL of essential oil was added to a 20-mL vial, which was incubated at 90 °C for 40 min, and then it was analyzed with an Agilent 19091s-433UIHP-5MS capillary column (30 m × 320 μm × 0.25 μm) in an Aglient 7890 GC/5795 MS machine. The injection volume was 1 μL, the split ratio was 5:1, and the gas flow rate was 2.0 mL/min. The temperature of both the injector and detector was 250 °C. The oven temperature was programmed as follows: it was held at 40 °C for 2 min, increased to 260 °C at 5 °C/min, and then held constant at 260 °C for 1 min. Mass spectra were obtained using the electron impact (EI+) mode at 70eV with an ion source temperature of 250 °C. Mass spectra were recorded in the 50–500 range. The structures of the samples were identified by computerized matches in the NIST 10 spectral library. The areas of ion current peaks were determined and normalized into relative peak areas.
