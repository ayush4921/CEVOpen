<p>For the PMP reaction, 100 μL of monosaccharide solution or sample solution was mixed with 50 μl 0.3 M NaOH and 50 μL 0.5 M PMP in 1.5 mL tubes and incubated for 40 min at 80 °C in a water bath. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and neutralized with 50 μL 0.3 M HCl. Then, the mixture was extracted three times with 200 μL of chloroform. The aqueous phase was collected and brought to 1 mL with distilled water before filtration through a 0.45 μm Millipore filter. The filtrate was analyzed by RP-HPLC using the following conditions. Mobile phase: ACN/20 mM ammonium acetate solution (Ph = 5.5) (22/78); detection wavelength: 245 nm, flow rate: 1.0 mL/min; column temperature: 30 °C; column type: Dikma Platisil ODS column (250 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm). The HPLC chromatogram of monosaccharide composition was shown in
