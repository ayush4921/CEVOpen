<p>In this study, the contents of polysaccharide and triterpenoids and the composition of essential oil were simultaneously compared between fermented mycelia and artificial cultivated sclerotium of P. cocos. Besides determining the polysaccharide content using UV spectrophotometry, we used a pre-column 1-phenyl-3-methyl-5-pyrazolone (PMP) derivatization method to determine the monosaccharide composition of different kinds of polysaccharides from both fermented mycelia and cultivated sclerotium of 
 <italic>P. cocos</italic>. The levels of the three main triterpenoids (DTA, eDTA, and PAC) were determined using reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). In addition, we found that a pleasant fruit-like fragrance was produced during the fermentation process. The volatile compounds were extracted from the fermentation media by water steam distillation and analyzed by GC-MS coupled with a head-space sampler. Then, the main components were identified in the NIST 10 spectral library. The comparative study will provide important and stereo information for the utilization of liquid cultured
