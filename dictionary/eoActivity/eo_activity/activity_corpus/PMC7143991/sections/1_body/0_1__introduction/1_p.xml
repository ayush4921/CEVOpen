<p>Medicinal mushrooms are rich sources of therapeutically useful and biologically active agents [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-25-01269" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. For several thousand years, 
 <italic>Poria cocos</italic>, a traditional Chinese medicinal and food mushroom that belongs to the family of Polyporaceae, has been used in China and other East Asian countries for its ability to invigorate the spleen and tonify the stomach; it also has sedative, tranquilizing, and diuretic properties [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-25-01269" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. As reported previously, the chemical constituents of 
 <italic>P. cocos</italic> include polysaccharides [

 <xref rid="B4-molecules-25-01269" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-25-01269" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-25-01269" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and triterpenoids [

 <xref rid="B8-molecules-25-01269" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-25-01269" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-01269" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Basically, there are two kinds of polysaccharides in sclerotium, water-soluble polysaccharides (WPS) (active form, 0.51–2.69%) and alkali-soluble polysaccharides (APS) (inactive form, 32.25–76.64%) [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-25-01269" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Crude WPS isolated from 
 <italic>P. cocos</italic> was found to reduce the tumor growth by 11.5–18.5% and enhance the antioxidant enzyme activity when fed for 7 weeks at the daily dose of 100–200 mg/Kg in liver cancae male Wistar rats [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-25-01269" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Recently, APS was reported to improve hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and hepatic steatosis in ob/ob mice via the modulation of gut microbiota [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-25-01269" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Exopolysaccharides (EPS), another kind of water-soluble polysaccharide, is produced in the media during the liquid fermentation of 
 <italic>P. cocos</italic>, and it has also been reported to have anti-tumor activity both in vivo (Sarcoma-180 solid tumors implanted in BALB/c mice, a immune deficient inbred mice line) and in vitro (HL-60 tumor cells) [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-25-01269" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] as well as antioxidant activities [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-25-01269" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Triterpenoids are reported to be responsible for the diuretic [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-01269" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], anti-tumor [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-01269" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and anti-inflammatory activities [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-25-01269" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] of 
 <italic>P. cocos</italic>. More than 50 triterpenoids have been purified from 
 <italic>P. cocos</italic>, derived from lanostane or secolanostane skeletons [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-01269" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. A more systematic introduction about the chemistry and pharmacology activity of 
 <italic>P.cocos</italic> has been reviewed [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-01269" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The main constituents are dehydrotumulosic acid (DTA), 3-epi-dehydrotumulosic acid (eDTA), and polyporenic acid C (PAC) [
