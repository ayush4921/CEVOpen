<p>As a consequence of its nutritional and health values, 
 <italic>P. cocos</italic> has gained wide popularity as a nutraceutical and functional food in China. Normally, 
 <italic>P. cocos</italic> grows underground around the roots or dried trunks of pine trees and needs a long cultivation period of about 7 months. In recent decades, the fermentation culture of 
 <italic>P. cocos</italic> has been developed because of the potential for the increased production of mycelia and bioactive components in a compact space and in a shorter period of time. Many studies have been conducted to examine the influence of different conditions on 
 <italic>P. cocos</italic> culture, including medium composition, temperature, and environmental conditions [

 <italic>P. cocos</italic> has been proven as a potential way for the production of triterpenoids [
