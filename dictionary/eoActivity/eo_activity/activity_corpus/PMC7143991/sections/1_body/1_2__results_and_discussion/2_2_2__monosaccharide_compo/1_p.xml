<p>In order to determine the monosaccharide composition, different kinds of polysaccharides (WPS, EPS, and APS) were subjected to pre-column PMP derivatization and analyzed by RP-HPLC. As shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-01269-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, the main components of the water-soluble polysaccharides, including EPS and WPS, from fermented mycelia and sclerotium, are mannose (4.48–27.1%), galactose (5.17–38.48%) and glucose (12.87–89.19%), which is consistent with previous reports [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-25-01269" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The main component of the APS from the cultivated sclerotium of 
 <italic>P. cocos</italic> is glucose (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-01269-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The glucose content reached 97.11%, which is consistent with a previous report that the APS is a β-glucan [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-25-01269" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, the glucose content of APS from fermented mycelia of 
 <italic>P. cocos</italic> was much lower (59.8%) and the other major components were mannose (24.8%) and arabinose (11.51%). The results indicated that the mannose and galactose content of both WPS and APS from fermented mycelia are significantly higher than that from sclerotium. It should also be noted that among five kinds of crude polysaccharides, only EPS contained an acidic monosaccharide, glucuronic acid (16.94%). It has been reported that polysaccharides containing acidic monosaccharide showed higher immunology stimulation activity [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-01269" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In the future, the biological activity and the linkage type of different monosaccharides of these polysaccharides should be further studied.
