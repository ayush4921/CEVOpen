<p>It was reported that in 
 <italic>P. cocos</italic>, terpenes are biosynthesized via the mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-25-01269" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Monoterpenes and triterpenes are derived from same precursor, geranyl-PP [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-25-01269" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01269-f004">Figure 4</xref>. During the fermentation process, essential oils are secreted into the media and the two main monoterpenes are linalool (35.72%) and geraniol (5.16%). The amount of geranyl-PP required for monoterpene biosynthesis is about 1.17 g/L. However, the total amount of essential oil produced during the whole fermentation process would be even higher than what we measured, because some of the volatile compounds will be lost due to evaporation while shaking the culture. Under the current culture conditions, the total amount of triterpenes produced was 447 mg/L. If the production of essential oil compounds, especially monoterpenes, can be inhibited and the precursors can be converted to triterpenoids instead, then the production of triterpenoids could be much higher. This gives us a reasonable strategy to manipulate the production of triterpenoids through fermentation.
