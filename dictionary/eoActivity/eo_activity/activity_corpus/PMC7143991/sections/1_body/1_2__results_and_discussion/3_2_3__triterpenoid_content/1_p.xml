<p>As demonstrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01269-f002">Figure 2</xref>, DTA (RT = 9.527 min), eDTA (RT = 13.327 min), and PAC (RT = 12.307 min) are separated well by HPLC. Therefore, this method can be used for quantification. There were no apparent differences between the HPLC profiles of cultured mycelia and cultivated sclerotium of 
 <italic>P. cocos</italic>, but the mycelium peak areas were significantly larger under the analytical conditions used here. For cultured mycelia collected on the 17th day after inoculation, the triterpenoid contents were 1.2% (DTA), 0.42% (eDTA), and 1.0% (PAC). This was significantly higher than that in cultivated material: 0.2% (DTA), 0.12 (eDTA), and 0.16% (PAC) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01269-f003">Figure 3</xref>, peaks 4–8 were also probable triterpenoids. Due to the lack of standard compounds, the peak areas of the unknown compounds (4–8) were recorded and calculated based on the standard formula for DTA. The total triterpenoid content (calculated from peaks 1–8) was 8.36%, which was 9.98 times of that in cultivated 
 <italic>P. cocos</italic> sclerotium (0.84%). The DTA, eDTA, and PAC yields were 71.36 mg/L, 26.41 mg/L, and 60.12 mg/L, respectively, and the yield of total triterpenoids in culture was about 497.14 mg/L. These results demonstrated the advantages for producing useful secondary metabolites using the fermentation of 
 <italic>P. cocos</italic> mycelia. Our previously published result proved that a higher content of triterpenoids in a two-stage cultured mycelia of P. cocos had stronger diuretic activity in rats compared with cultivated sclerotium [
