<p>There are also remarkable differences between essential oils obtained from two origins in which the percentage of 1-butanol, 2-methyl and 1-butanol, and 3-methyl in the essential oil of the fresh external layer of 
 <italic>P. cocos</italic> reached 29.9% and 11.93%, whereas two compounds were not even detected in the media essential oil. A similar situation was found in Bicyclo[3.1.1]hept-3-en-2-one, 4,6,6-trimethyl (1S). Besides, an important fragrance, phenylethanol, was also detected in the fresh external layer rather than the culture media. According to our results, the yield of total essential oil in the fermentation media was 3.6 mL/L. This unexpected result indicated that essential oils, in addition to WPS, EPS, and triterpenoids, are another useful product from the fermentation of
