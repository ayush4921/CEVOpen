<p>The WPS and APS contents in cultured mycelia were 4.26% and 5.55% respectively, which were 4.02-folds and 0.08-fold those in cultivated sclerotium (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01269-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The yield of WPS, APS, and EPS from fermentation was 252.64 mg/L, 329.14 mg/L, and 471.84 mg/L, respectively. As reported previously, WPS is the biologically active polysaccharide in cultivated 
 <italic>P. cocos</italic>. EPS was also reported to exhibit anti-tumor effects. Therefore, the higher content of water-soluble polysaccharides, including WPS and EPS, in fermented mycelia than in cultivated sclerotium would be an important advantage. APS, which is the main component of the cell wall in fungi [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-01269" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], contributes over 70% of the biomass of cultivated 
 <italic>P. cocos</italic> sclerotium. As reported, the underground conditions, especially environmental pressure, pathogens, and other stress conditions, play important roles in cell wall development and APS accumulation [
