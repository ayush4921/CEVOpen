<p>As we know, there have been no reports about the fragrance in 
 <italic>P. cocos</italic> sclerotium, which makes it unexpected when a strong pleasant fruit-like aroma was found during fermentation. When we sampled the cultured mycelia, we found that the aroma was much stronger in the fermentation media than in the mycelia. Therefore, the essential oils were extracted and analyzed with a HS-GC/MS system. The total ion chromatograms are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01269-f003">Figure 3</xref>. In all, 62 major volatile compounds were identified from the culture media and fresh external layer of 
 <italic>P. cocos</italic> according to the NIST spectral library, including 24 alcohols, 6 aldehydes, 11 esters, 6 alkenes, and 15 other components, as shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-01269-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The percentage of total identified compounds was 99.96% and 98.03% for essential oils from culture media and a fresh external layer, respectively.
