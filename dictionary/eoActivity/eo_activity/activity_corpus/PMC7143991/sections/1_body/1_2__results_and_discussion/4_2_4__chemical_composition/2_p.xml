<p>Among the 62 identified components, 25 were considered to be fragrances according to the Dictionary of Flavor and Fragrance [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-01269" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] shown in bold type in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-01269-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. These compounds account for 78.76% of the total peak area in culture media essential oil and 54.4% of that in a fresh external layer of cultivated 
 <italic>P. cocos</italic>. The major fragrance components in common were linalool (35.72% in media essential oil and 9.65% in external layer essential oil) and methyl phenylacetate (31.29% in media essential oil and 19.98% in external layer essential oil). Linalool is a naturally occurring monoterpene alcohol found in many flowers and spice plants with wide commercial applications all over the world. Methyl phenylacetate is formed from methanol and phenylacetic acid, and it has a strong odor similar to honey. It occurs naturally in honey, pepper, coffee, and capsicum. In the esters identified from the culture media, methyl jasmonate (0.7%) is also an important signal compound for plants against environmental stress and has been used for the improvement of secondary metabolites in the cell and tissue culture system of many medicinal plants [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-01269" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. It has also been reported that the application of methyl jasmonate in the culture media improved the accumulation of triterpenoids in another two important medicinal mushrooms 
 <italic>Inonotus baumii</italic> (Sanghuang in Chinese) [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-01269" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and 
 <italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-01269" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] (Lingzhi in Chinese), both belonging to the same family of Polyporaceae with 
 <italic>P. cocos</italic>. Therefore, the reason why the liquid cultured 
 <italic>P. cocos</italic> mycelia secreted this signal compound and the function of this compound in the regulation of secondary metabolites such as triterpenoids needs further investigation.
