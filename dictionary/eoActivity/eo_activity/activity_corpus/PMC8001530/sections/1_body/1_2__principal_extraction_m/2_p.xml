<p>Innovative methods (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-13-00327-f001">Figure 1</xref>), compared to the classical ones, have numerous advantages, due to the reduction in the use of solvents and in the extraction time. 
 <italic>Supercritical fluid extraction</italic> is one of the most common innovative methods. The solvent used is generally CO
 <sub>2</sub>, which is compressed and heated to reach the supercritical state; passing through the parts of the plant, supercritical CO
 <sub>2</sub> is loaded by volatile components and extracts; in the end, the depression phase allows the separation of the oil [

 <italic>Subcritical extraction liquids</italic> can be exploited using water and CO
 <sub>2</sub> at the subcritical state, thus using lower temperatures. In 
 <italic>ultrasound-assisted extraction</italic>, the vegetable is immersed in water or other solvent: the ultrasound action favors the release of EOs from the plant, owing to mechanical vibration of the cellular walls and membranes [

 <italic>Microwave-assisted extraction</italic> is one of the most potent and promising extraction methods. There are many variants: solvent free microwaves extraction (SFME); microwave hydrodiffusion and gravity (MHG); microwave steam distillation (MSD); microwave steam diffusion (MSDf). Farhat and co-worked studied the use of MSDf to extract 
 <italic>Lavandula</italic> EO [

 <italic>Lavandula</italic> EOs proposed by PÃ©rino-Issartier and co-workers, it was proved that MSDf is more efficient in terms of extraction time, and the quality of the extract is superior [

 <italic>Instant controlled pressure drop</italic> (DIC) method is composed of four steps: first, the plants have to be placed under the vacuum, the steam bath is applied at determined pressure and temperature, then the void is instantly detained and the sample is taken back to the atmospheric pressure.
