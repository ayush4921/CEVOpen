<p>According to the definition given by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the term EO is related to a “product obtained from vegetable raw material, either by distillation with water or steam, or from the epicarp of citrus fruits by a mechanical process or by dry distillation.” In order to extract EOs from vegetable raw material, different methods can be exploited, which can be classified in two categories: the classical (or conventional) methods and the innovative (or advanced) ones [

 <xref rid="B6-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It is important to underline that the oil composition is strictly influenced by the variety of the plant, the place where it has grown (climate and environment, any stress suffered), the type of nutrition and fertilizers used [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-13-00327-f001">Figure 1</xref>) are not very advantageous due to the thermolability of EOs (high temperatures used) and the low quality of the extract (production of chemical artefacts, due to long extraction time). Among these methods 
 <italic>Hydrodistillation</italic> can be considered a simple and old technique (it was used by Avicenna in 10th century). The parts of the plants (particularly flowers and petals) are directly boiled inside the water; this alembic is connected with a condenser (which holds the essential oil) and a decanter (that collects the evaporated water) [

 <italic>Entrainment by water steam</italic>. The principle is the same as hydrodistillation, but the plant is not in contact with water. There are several variants of this method, such as vapor-hydrodistillation, steam distillation, hydrodiffusion [

 <italic>Organic solvent extraction</italic> is the third common method. The parts of the plant are put inside an organic solvent and macerated; the solvent is removed under pressure, in order to concentrate the extract. EOs extraction can also be performed by 
 <italic>cold pressing</italic>. This is a traditional method used to extract EOs from citrus fruit zest. Oil sacs or oil glands break during extraction, releasing the volatile oil, which is mechanically recovered by centrifugation [
