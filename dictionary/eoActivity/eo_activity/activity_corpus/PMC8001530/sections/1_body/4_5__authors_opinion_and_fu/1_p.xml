<p>To the best of our knowledge, there is no evidence about the effectiveness of EOs as primary treatment in pharmacological treatments. It is worth to remind that unlike many plants, which are marketed as biochemical actives in humans, therefore classified as drugs, after proper scientific studies about effectiveness and safety, EOs are not subjected to the same studies about reproducible usefulness and safety. To date, in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classification, EOs are considered either cosmetics/food supplements or drugs, depending on their intended use, however their sales and uses are not regulated by FDA. Companies who manufacture or market EOs have a legal responsibility for ensuring their safety. Therefore, researchers and users should take into consideration the quality of the EOs based on the reputation of their sources. Nevertheless, the researchersâ€™ interest in EOs applications is increasing due to the possibility to exploit them.</p>
