<p>The need of EO encapsulation represents a valid strategy to reach their pharmaceutical application, which is limited by their many drawbacks. Herein, we described different potential applications of EOs in the pharmaceutical field, and we presented the results obtained by different researchers in the development of lipid-based DDS for EOs encapsulation, such as micro and nanoemulsions, liposomes, SLN and NLC. According to literature data, all strategies demonstrated a good ability in improving EOs stability and effectiveness, increasing their bioavailability compared to the pure compound. Some interesting recent applications are related to the combined encapsulation of the EO with a conventional synthetic drug, in order to improve the effectiveness, the biocompatibility, and reducing the resistant mechanisms. As discussed above, the selection of the quali-quantitative composition of the formulation and of the preparation method represent key parameters for obtaining a final formulation with the most appropriate properties for the desired pharmaceutical application. A direct comparison of the different lipid-based delivery systems studied is not easily achievable due to the substantial differences existing among them in terms of structure and behavior. In particular, in the design of a proper system for the delivery of a specific EO, different variables should be taken into consideration, such as the production method (use of heat or organic solvents), the selection of biocompatible and biodegradable raw materials, and the desired nanocarrier properties (i.e., mean size, stability, encapsulation efficiency and release profile).</p>
