<p>In our opinion, the efforts of researchers should be more focused on the development of patentable products by scalable production methods of interest for the pharmaceutical industry. In order to exploit EOs potential use as coadjuvant to traditional drugs and therapies, thanks to their many interesting biological activities, further investigations should be developed to describe their mechanisms of action and their eventual toxicological side effects. Therefore, more in vivo studies should be undertaken to provide reliable results of pharmaceutical interest, thus allowing the pharmaceutical application of newest EO-loaded delivery systems as anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antioxidant, antifungal coadjuvant approaches.</p>
