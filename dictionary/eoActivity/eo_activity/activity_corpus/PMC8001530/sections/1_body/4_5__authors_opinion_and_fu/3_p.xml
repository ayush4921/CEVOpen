<p>However, thinking in terms of a near-future prospective for potential EOs application among the various colloidal lipid-based carriers analyzed in this review, it is the opinion of the authors that NLC have a greater possibility of being employed as a nanomedicine in the combined delivery of EOs and conventional drugs. In fact, the possibility of using EOs as intrinsic components of the lipid matrix in combination with solid lipids and surfactants approved by international commits for safety drugs and administration could represent the new frontier of EOs combined coadjuvant therapy in nanomedicine.</p>
