<p>SLN were proposed in the early 1990s as a tool to overcome the limits related to liposomes, exploiting the use of physiological lipids (e.g., blends of mono-, di- or tri-glycerides, fatty acids, waxes) [
 <xref rid="B185-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">185</xref>], solid at room and/or body temperature, in mixture with surfactants and water. The solidity of the lipid attributes some advantages to the system, such as increased chemical protection, less leakage, and sustained release [
 <xref rid="B186-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">186</xref>]. Other relevant advantages are the high targeting effect and low toxicity, which is related to the use of biodegradable and biocompatible lipid substances with a GRAS (“generally recognized as safe”) status [
 <xref rid="B187-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">187</xref>]. Different studies on EOs-loaded SLN report the enhanced anticancer activity of EOs [
 <xref rid="B188-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>]. Frankincense and myrrh oil obtained from the genera 
 <italic>Boswellia</italic> and 
 <italic>Commiphora</italic>, respectively, were loaded into SLN prepared with Compritol 888 ATO by high-pressure homogenization, and their anticancer activity after oral administration was evaluated in vivo in H22-bearing Kunming mice [
 <xref rid="B189-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">189</xref>]. The obtained results demonstrated the possibility to encapsulate EO into SLN having mean size smaller than 220 nm, with high encapsulation efficiency (&gt;98%). Furthermore, a significantly higher in vivo antitumor efficacy was observed compared to EO suspension and EO-loaded into β-cyclodextrin, used to increase EO solubility, at the same dosage. Another interesting anticancer application was recently proposed by Rodenak-Kladniew and co-workers based on the delivery of linalool into SLN prepared with different solid lipids (myristyl myristate, cetyl esters and cetyl palmitate) prepared by sonication using Pluronic
 <sup>®</sup>F68 as surfactant [
 <xref rid="B190-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>]. The aim of this work was to exploit the potential anticancer activity of linalool (an acyclic monoterpene alcohol commonly found in EOs of different plants and herbs including lavender, basil, rosemary, citric fruits, green, and black tea) as a mono-drug agent or in combination with traditional drugs. Collected results demonstrated the possibility to obtain stable formulations with mean size around 100 nm, able to provide a controlled release of linalool EO. Interestingly, a cytotoxic activity was observed against human lung- and liver-derived tumor cells (A549 and HepG2, respectively), thus demonstrating that linalool-SLN represents a potential combined approach to enhance the activity of anticancer drugs [
 <xref rid="B190-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>]. Another application of EO-SLN was investigated by Zhao et al., who focused their research on the pulmonary delivery of 
 <italic>Yuxingcao</italic> EO in SLN prepared with Compritol 888 ATO by high-shear homogenization, using polyvinyl alcohol as emulsifier agent, thus overcoming the rapid clearance of pulmonary absorption [
 <xref rid="B191-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">191</xref>]. Authors demonstrated the feasibility of the encapsulation strategy to produce a 
 <italic>Yuxingcao</italic> EO-SLN inhalation delivery able to improve the elimination half-life in the lungs, enhancing the active compound local bioavailability, thus potentially limiting the administration doses to one per day. Due to the antimicrobial activity of EOs, their encapsulation into SLN has also been investigated as a promising strategy to reduce the microbial resistance to antibiotics, one of the major problems in the treatment of different diseases, such as topical infections, and in wound healing. In order to improve the antibacterial and antifungal activity of clove oil (the EO obtained from 
 <italic>Eugenia caryophyllata</italic>), Fazly et al. prepared SLN by high-shear homogenization and ultrasound method, using glyceryl monostearate, precirol, and stearic acid as lipid phase [
 <xref rid="B192-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">192</xref>]. Clove encapsulation into SLN effectively improved its antimicrobial activity, reducing the MIC/MCC values from 2–20 folds, with higher effects against Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. This result was related to the ability of SLN to interact with microbial cell membrane and to the improvement of the EO stability and solubility [
 <xref rid="B192-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">192</xref>]. Authors observed that clove-loaded SLN prepared with stearic acid showed better results compared to SLN prepared with the other selected lipids, and related this result to its lower particles size which would increase passive cellular absorption enhancing antimicrobial activity, as reported by Nasseri et al. [
 <xref rid="B193-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">193</xref>]. SLN can be also used as carrier for more than one antimicrobial drug: in order to enhance the antimicrobial activity of ofloxacin against 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, Rodenak-Kladniew prepared a SLN platform containing the aforementioned drug together with two antibacterial active components, chitosan and eugenol, considering various matches: ofloxacin, ofloxacin-SLN, ofloxacin-chitosan-SLN, ofloxacin-chitosan-eugenol SLN. Considering the 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> model, the obtained MIC values went from about 1.73 ± 0.40 μg/mL of free ofloxacin to 0.29 ± 0.07 μg/mL of ofloxacin-chitosan-eugenol SLN, thus causing a six-fold decrease of this parameter. Even better results emerged for 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> model, with a 16-fold reduction of MIC values, from 0.31 ± 0.05 μg/mL of free ofloxacin to 0.02 ± 0.01 μg/mL of ofloxacin-chitosan-eugenol SLN. This excellent microbial toxicity is not associated with toxicity to human cells, as shown by the MTT assay. On the other hand, with concentrations 10–150-fold higher than the ones required for therapeutic action, eugenol alters glutathione levels leading to cell death [
 <xref rid="B190-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>]. The effect of physicochemical properties on the different activities of nanoparticulate systems was also investigated by Pereira et al. [
 <xref rid="B194-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">194</xref>], who developed and optimized, using factorial design, linalool-SLN with long-term stability, demonstrating that the variation of surfactant concentration significantly influences mean particles size and homogeneity, since as the surfactant concentration increased, a reduction in particle size was observed. The design of experiment was exploited also by Zielinska et al. to develop citral-loaded SLN by hot high-pressure homogenization [
 <xref rid="B195-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">195</xref>]. The 2
 <sup>2</sup> factorial design determined the optimal concentration of components: 1 wt% of citral, 4 wt% of lipid glycerol monostearate and 2.5 wt% of poloxamer 188, selected as surfactant to obtain homogeneous nanoparticles with mean size lower than 100 nm. In the same study, the anti-inflammatory activity of citral and geraniol, comparing pure EOs and EO-loaded SNL, was evaluated. The analysis of the inhibition of NO production, measured on RAW 264.7 cells, showed a greater anti-inflammatory activity of citral compared to geraniol. The results of the cytotoxicity assay showed that cell viability in HaCaT cells was significantly reduced by citral, even if its effect was more evident in the treatment of A431 cells, thus demonstrating the skin anti-cancer potential of this monoterpene [
 <xref rid="B195-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">195</xref>]. Saporito and co-workers recently developed lipid nanoparticles of first generation (SLN) and second generation (nanostructured lipid carriers, NLC) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-13-00327-f006">Figure 6</xref>) for the delivery of eucalyptus or rosemary EOs as potential medical devices, to improve healing of skin wounds [
