<p>Liposomes are vesicular self-assembled system characterized by one or more bilayers, constituted by phospholipids, surrounding an aqueous core. They were first studied as drug delivery systems in 1970, since they can be used as carriers for both lipophilic and hydrophilic molecules, due to the presence of the hydrophilic compartment and lipophilic bilayer [
