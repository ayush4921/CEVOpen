<p>Despite many interesting applications, the EOs are fragile and unstable volatile compounds, subject to enzymatic reactions, phenomena that compromise their biological properties, causing a decrease of activity and an increase of toxicity (irritation, photosensitization, etc.,), which limit their traditional use. These limits could be improved exploiting the encapsulation of EOs in drug delivery systems (DDS) that provide a controlled drug release, increasing the bioavailability and efficiency of EO, thus providing an optimal pharmacokinetic profile [
