<p>NLC represent a second generation of lipid nanoparticles, born in 1999 in order to overcome the limits related to SLN, such as limited drug-loading capacity and potential drug expulsion during storage. NLC are characterized by the presence of a liquid lipid, together with the solid lipid, which allows the formation of an imperfect or amorphous structure, able to guarantee higher drug loading values compared to SLN, thus avoiding drug loss during storage [
 <xref rid="B185-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">185</xref>]. Cocoa butter was selected as solid lipid, while olive oil or sesame oil were used as liquid lipids in NLC formulations [
 <xref rid="B196-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">196</xref>]. Interestingly, NLC showed higher bioadhesive properties compared to SLN, probably due to their flexible structure which would promote interactions with biologic substrate, thus promoting lesion closure. As reported in the in vitro cytotoxicity studies, the presence of olive oil increased the cell viability due to the high content of oleic acid, previously demonstrated to promote cell proliferation. Furthermore, in vivo studies on a rat burn model confirmed that NLC prepared with olive oil and loaded with 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> EO were able to promote the closure of the wound, providing good reepithelization and stratum corneum formation [
 <xref rid="B196-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">196</xref>]. Cocoa butter and olive oil were also used as solid lipid and liquid lipid respectively to encapsulate cardamom EO, producing small NLC (&lt;150 nm) with an encapsulation efficiency higher than 90%. Results obtained from in vitro release studies and DPPH scavenging activity assay demonstrated that the DDS structure is able to protect the EO—during the storage—and thus enhance its antioxidant property, also because of the presence of the two natural oils [
 <xref rid="B197-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">197</xref>]. The suitability of the monoterpene carvacrol as a component of binary mixtures of NLC solid lipids was deeply analyzed by Galvao and co-workers [
 <xref rid="B198-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">198</xref>]. The considered solid lipids were stearic acid, beeswax, and carnauba wax, which were analyzed both as pure components and in mixture with different ratio of carvacrol (10%, 25%, and 50% 
 <italic>w/w</italic>). The obtained binary mixtures showed lower values of enthalpy and melting temperatures, highlighting the relevance of this active ingredient in the formulation of NLC. Moreover, carvacrol demonstrated to increase the loading capacity and the encapsulation efficiency of carnauba wax and beeswax—through the extension of the interlayer—when compared with the pure waxes [
 <xref rid="B198-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">198</xref>]. A comparison between beeswax or carnauba wax was also made in order to select the optimal solid lipid component in the formulation of clove oil-loaded NLC. It resulted that the presence of carnauba wax led to the formation of NLC with higher particles size and PDI values compared to the ones produced with beeswax; furthermore, even better values were obtained by also introducing the liquid lipid crodamol, with the production of NLC that were stable even after storage. Additionally, beeswax-crodamol nanoparticles showed a higher clove encapsulation efficiency (66 ± 1%–63 ± 0%) when compared with carnauba wax-crodamol ones (60 ± 2%–58 ± 0%): again, the presence of the liquid lipid is decisive. In both situations, the formulations showed no decrease in encapsulated clove percentages after 30 days storage, demonstrating the great suitability of these component in the formulation of NLC for clove delivery [
 <xref rid="B199-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">199</xref>]. The wound-healing application of thymol-loaded NLC was recently investigated [
 <xref rid="B200-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">200</xref>]. Herein, Pivetta and co-workers prepared NLC exploiting the hydrating, cicatrizing, and anti-inflammatory properties of two natural lipids, Illipe butter and Calendula oil, to encapsulate thymol EO, whose anti-inflammatory activity could improve the wound healing [
 <xref rid="B200-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">200</xref>]. Thymol-NLC, with mean particles size &lt; 150 nm, narrow size distribution (PDI &lt; 0.3), negative zeta potential (−12.5 mV), and high encapsulation efficiency (90%), were prepared by hot emulsion followed by sonication. NLC were able to reduce the cytotoxicity of the EO on a non-tumorigenic immortalized human keratinocytes cell line (HaCatT). Thymol-NLC hydrogel obtained using Carbopol gel, selected for its high biological compatibility, were able to provide a fast EO release and to maintain the EO release over time. Interestingly, thymol-NLC hydrogel showed higher anti-inflammatory activity compared to the free EO, as confirmed by in vitro studies. The results of the in vivo antipsoriatic activity test performed using a model of imiquimod psoriasis-like inflammation, enabled to observe that the mice treated with thymol-NLC hydrogel showed a delay in the development of the inflammation and that the severity of the inflammation was reduced compared to the negative control group [
 <xref rid="B200-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">200</xref>]. A combined approach to the treatment of wound healing was recently proposed by Carbone et al., who prepared ferulic acid-loaded NLC using 
 <italic>Lavandula</italic> EO or isopropyl myristate (IPM) as the liquid oil component [
 <xref rid="B201-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">201</xref>]. NLC with homogeneous particles lower than 150 nm were obtained by the phase inversion temperature (PIT) method; the presence of 
 <italic>Lavandula</italic> EO, instead of the liquid synthetic oil, increased the long-term stability of the suspension, probably due to the tendency of the particles to flocculate. Interestingly, the morphological study revealed that the choice of the liquid oil component affected the NLC structure, since 
 <italic>Lavandula</italic>-NLC presented small spherically shaped particles with a type-II (amorphous) structure, while the presence of the synthetic oil induced the formation of a similar multiple-type-III NLC, with the presence of grape-like aggregates of very small oil nanocomponents outside the main nanoparticle [
 <xref rid="B201-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">201</xref>]. The type-II structure of ferulic acid-NLC prepared with Lavandula EO also affected the cumulative amount of drug released, which was found to be lower compared to those of NLC prepared with the synthetic oil (46% and 62%, respectively). Interestingly, the type-II structure also improved the cytocompatibility on human fibroblasts and enhanced fibroblast migration promoting wound healing. Therefore, authors concluded that a potential combined protective effect of the antioxidant drug and Lavandula EO was achieved using NLC, in which the co-presence shows a synergistic effect in promoting cell migration. In order to reduce the volatilization and improve the bioavailability of linalool EO, NLC were prepared and optimized by high-pressure homogenization using glycerin monostearate as solid lipid and decanoyl/octanoyl-glycerides as liquid lipid [
 <xref rid="B202-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">202</xref>]. The optimized formulation obtained using 2.5% 
 <italic>w/w</italic> of each lipid in the surfactant mixture span80/tween80 (2.0 and 4.0% 
 <italic>w/w</italic>, respectively) showed homogeneous spherical particles of about 50 nm able to provide a controlled EO release. In vivo pharmacokinetics studies confirmed that linalool-loaded NLC were able to significantly improve the EO absorption and bioavailability, as confirmed by the higher values of t
 <sub>1/2</sub>, t
 <sub>max</sub> and C
 <sub>max</sub> obtained for the loaded EO compared to the free linalool solution [
 <xref rid="B202-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">202</xref>]. Peppermint essential oil was analyzed in order to explore its wound-healing and antibacterial activity, when encapsulated into NLC. Although the encapsulation efficiency of EO into NLC has been found to be very high (93.2 ± 1.2%), in vitro studies on various bacterial cell lines have shown that its antimicrobial activity is comparable to the pure essential oil one; in particular, pure EO MIC values were in the range 5.16 ± 1.48–20.00 ± 0.00, while EO-loaded NLC MIC values were between 5.10 ± 1.49 and 20.00 ± 0.00. The importance of the incorporation of this EO into DDS has been highlighted, instead, by in vivo studies on infected wound models: the wound-healing rate was accelerated due to the ability of the EO-NLC to decrease the bacterial count, in addition to the intrinsic anti-inflammatory property of the EO, which was also improved by the NLC structure [
 <xref rid="B203-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">203</xref>]. The antimicrobial activity of menthol-loaded NLC, with mean size of 115 nm and high EO encapsulation efficiency (98.73%), was investigated by Piran et al. [
 <xref rid="B204-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">204</xref>]. In particular, menthol-loaded NLC showed higher antibacterial activity against fungi and Gram-positive bacteria compared to the EO emulsion: NLC were able to inhibit the growth of 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic>, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli,</italic> and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> at concentration of 125, 250, 500, and 78 µg/mL, respectively, while the corresponding MIC values for menthol emulsion were 1000, 2000, 2000, and 156 µg/mL. Piran et al., therefore concluded that menthol encapsulation in NLC allows decreasing the amount of the EO for preserving foodstuffs from microorganism growth and spoilage. The influence of the preparation method in determining the characteristics of EO-loaded NLC was investigated by Carbone et al., who investigated a lab-scale (phase inversion temperature method) and a scalable (high-pressure homogenization) production methods [
 <xref rid="B47-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Authors demonstrated that the greater energy used in the second method allowed obtaining smaller particles and more stable colloidal NLC, using 
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> L., 
 <italic>Lavandula x intermedia</italic> “Sumian” and 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>hirtum</italic> as liquid lipid. Interestingly, results of in vitro biological cell viability test on murine macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7) showed that the nanoencapsulation of the EO enhanced its biocompatibility, being 
 <italic>Lavandula</italic> and 
 <italic>Rosmarinus</italic> NLC the most biocompatible formulations up to a concentration of 0.1% (
 <italic>v/v</italic>). Furthermore, the nanoencapsulation did not reduce the intrinsic anti-inflammatory activity of the EO, which was found to decrease in the order 
 <italic>Lavandula</italic> &gt; 
 <italic>Rosmarinus</italic> ≥ 
 <italic>Origanum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B47-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Therefore, it was demonstrated that EO can be used as both active ingredients and oily components of NLC, thus enhancing the biocompatibility and reducing the cytotoxicity of the pure oils. The topical application of gel vehicles containing 
 <italic>Rosmarinus</italic>-loaded NLC was also investigated, confirming the potentiality of the EO encapsulation strategy in the treatment of cutaneous alterations involving loss of skin hydration and elasticity [
 <xref rid="B205-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">205</xref>]. 
 <italic>Lavandula</italic> and 
 <italic>Rosmarinus</italic> were shown to be anti-proliferative agents with the potential to be used as co-adjuvants in combination with clotrimazole-loaded NLC in the treatment of topical candidiasis [
 <xref rid="B206-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>]. In this recent study, homogeneous small sized NLC (&lt;100 nm) with long-term stability were successfully prepared using 
 <italic>Lavandula</italic> and 
 <italic>Rosmarinus</italic> as liquid lipid, and loaded with clotrimazole. Interestingly, EO encapsulation into NLC induced an increase in the antiproliferative activity of the selected oils on keratinocytes cell line originated from human skin (HaCaT) and human epidermoid carcinoma cell line (A431), thus suggesting a possible use of 
 <italic>Rosmarinus</italic> and/or 
 <italic>Lavandula</italic>-loaded NLC as coadjuvants in non-cancerous proliferative skin diseases. The results of the in vitro test against 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, 
 <italic>Candida krusei</italic>, and 
 <italic>Candida parapsilosis</italic>, confirmed that clotrimazole-loaded NLC containing 
 <italic>Lavandula</italic> or 
 <italic>Rosmarinus</italic> were able to improve the antifungal drug activity, thus representing a promising strategy to enhance the effectiveness of traditional antimycotic drug against non-tumoral proliferative dermal diseases [
 <xref rid="B206-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>]. Topical delivery of drugs using DDS was further explored by Miranda and co-workers, studying 
 <italic>Ridolfia segetum</italic> (L.) Moris essential oil, which was encapsulated into homogeneous NLC with a mean size of 143 ± 5 nm. To increase biocompatibility and permeation, also EO-NLC hydrogel were prepared. Using dialysis membrane, it was analyzed the in vitro release of the EO from the nanoplatform, which resulted to be biphasic: at the beginning a low release was detected, which boosted at about 12 h. The in vivo permeation of both EO-NLC and EO-NLC hydrogel was studied using newborn pig epidermal membranes and it remarked that the hydrogel structure allowed a higher permeation than the simple NLC. The skin retention studies also supported the evidence that the hydrogel NLC formulation was able to provide a sustained release of the EO, acting as a reservoir [
 <xref rid="B207-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">207</xref>]. As noted in many of the above papers, particles dimension and polydispersion index appear to be significant for the development of appropriate nanoplatform systems. Therefore, the preformulation study is often decisive. A full factorial design approach was developed by Vieira and co-workers, in order to select the optimal amount of surfactant and solid lipid (2
 <sup>2</sup> factorial design) to prepare Sucupira Oil-Loaded NLC. It was obtained that the particle size decreased with higher surfactant concentration, while increased with growing concentrations of solid lipid; moreover, polydispersity index and zeta potential both increased with higher surfactant or solid lipid concentrations [
 <xref rid="B208-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">208</xref>]. The preformulation study was decisive also in the evaluation of the feasibility of spray-drying method in the production of redispersable lipid systems, considering both SLN and NLC loaded with 
 <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic> EO. It was developed a quality by design study considering four variables, analyzed at two levels: two of them were related to formulation composition—the presence (1%) or absence (0%) of the liquid lipid oleic acid and the cationic surfactant CTAB—while the other two were referred to spray drying conditions—the inlet drying temperature (60 °C and 80 °C) and the drying aids ratio in relation to the total formulation weight (1:1 and 2:1). Throughout this analysis, it was highlighted a probable interaction between the lipid CTAB—which has positive charge—and the gum Arabic—which has negative charge—as revealed by the increase in particle size and the inversion of the zeta potential. After redispersion of the powders, dynamic light scattering measurements showed no significant changes in particle size and PDI, demonstrating that spray drying method is adequate for this aim [
