<p>Different studies demonstrated the potentiality of liposomes in the delivery of EOs. Valenti et al. reported that 
 <italic>Santolina insularis</italic> EO showed a good in vitro antiherpetic activity against Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and that its stability was improved when loaded into liposomes [
 <xref rid="B171-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>]. The same research group also developed multilamellar vesicles (MLV) and small unilamellar vesicles (SUV) to improve the antiviral properties of 
 <italic>Artemisia arborescens</italic> L. EO [
 <xref rid="B172-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>]. Interestingly, authors found that EO-loaded MLVs enhanced the antiviral activity against HSV-1, while no significant differences of the antiviral activity were observed between the free EO and SUV vesicles, which showed a poor activity as determined by both the reduction of viral cytopathic effect assay and plaque reduction assay. Therefore, they concluded that the incorporation of 
 <italic>A. arborescens</italic> EO in multilamellar liposomes greatly improved its activity against intracellular HSV-1 [
 <xref rid="B172-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>]. Liolios and co-workers further investigated the influence of the liposomial encapsulation on the antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>Origanum dictamnus</italic> L. EO [
 <xref rid="B173-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>]. Carvacrol, thymol, p-cymene, and c-terpinene, identified as the major constituents of 
 <italic>Origanum dictamnus</italic> L., were isolated and successfully encapsulated in phosphatidyl choline-based liposomes, in order to evaluate the potential improvement of their antioxidant and antimicrobial activities against four Gram-positive and four Gram-negative bacteria and three human pathogenic fungi, as well as the food-borne pathogen, 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>. Interestingly, authors found that the encapsulation of monoterpenes leads to vesicles’ stabilization, as demonstrated by the increase in the onset temperature. Furthermore, a significant increase of the antimicrobial activity was found after the encapsulation in liposomes [
 <xref rid="B173-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>]. Liposomal formulation loaded with 
 <italic>Zataria multiflora</italic> Boiss EO, a well-known aromatic medicinal herb in Persian as “Avishan Shirazi” or “Azkand”, were successfully produced in order to compare the antibacterial activity of free EO and EO-loaded liposomes against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> [
 <xref rid="B174-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>]. Authors found that MIC and MBC values of EO-loaded liposomes were 1.4% and 1.8%, respectively, thus demonstrating the increasing antibacterial activity of the EO when loaded into liposomes. This result was related to the ability of liposomal formulation to improve the cellular transport and to release the active components inside the cell, due to cells interaction (inter-membrane transfer, contact release, absorption, fusion, and phagocytosis), whose mechanism is related to the cell type (cell wall/membrane composition), as well as liposome membrane’s physicochemical properties, as previously reported [
 <xref rid="B175-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">175</xref>]. Sebaaly et al. investigated the encapsulation of clove EO in natural soybean phospholipid liposomal vesicles, prepared by using the ethanol injection method [
 <xref rid="B176-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">176</xref>]. Authors demonstrated that liposomes were able to protect eugenol, the main component of clove EO, from the degradation induced by UV exposure, without any reduction of its DPPH scavenging activity. Interestingly, the same authors also investigated the possibility to prepare clove EO and eugenol-loaded liposomes using large scale procedures, such as membrane contactor [

 <xref rid="B178-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">178</xref>]. The potential antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> was demonstrated by Najafi et al. for liposomes prepared with lecithin/cholesterol and loaded with barije EO, extracted from 
 <italic>Ferula gummosa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B179-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">179</xref>]. An interesting application of EO-loaded liposomes was recently investigated by Palmas et al. [
 <xref rid="B180-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">180</xref>]. Herein, liposomes prepared with 
 <italic>Citrus limon</italic> var. 
 <italic>pompia</italic> were prepared as potential mouthwash product for the treatment of oropharyngeal diseases. Citral-loaded liposomes were demonstrated to be biocompatible and able to protect cells from the damages caused by oxidative stress. The vesicles also demonstrated to promote the healing of wounded mucosa, favoring the closure of lesions induced in a keratinocytes cell monolayer, and to inhibit the proliferation of 
 <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic>, when loading 50 mg/mL of citral EO [
 <xref rid="B180-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">180</xref>]. An interesting approach was recently developed basing on drug-in-cyclodextrin-in-liposomes (DCLs), which are constituted by one or more phospholipid bilayers and an aqueous internal cavity where a cyclodextrin/drug inclusion complex is loaded [
 <xref rid="B181-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">181</xref>]. Herein, Hammoud et al. encapsulated different EO components (estragole, eucalyptol, isoeugenol, pulegone, terpineol, and thymol) into DCLs, prepared by the ethanol injection method using lipoid S100 and hydroxypropil-β-cyclodextrin, as a promising tool for extending EOs shelf life and activity. The physico-chemical and technological characterization of DCLs revealed their ability in significantly improving the loading ratio of estragole, pulegone, and thymol, and prolong the release of EO components compared to traditional liposomes [

 <xref rid="B182-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">182</xref>]. Recently, Lin and co-workers developed an interesting strategy for the encapsulation of thyme EO into solid liposomes coated with ε-polylysine [
 <xref rid="B183-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">183</xref>]. Solid liposomes are novel nanosystems, with higher stability and longer storage time compared with traditional aqueous liposomes [
