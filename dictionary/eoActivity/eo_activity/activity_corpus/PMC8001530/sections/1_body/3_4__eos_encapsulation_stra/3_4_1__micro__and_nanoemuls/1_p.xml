<p>Microemulsions (mean droplet size 100â€“400 nm [
 <xref rid="B152-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]) and nanoemulsions (1 to 100 nm [
 <xref rid="B153-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>]) are isotropic dispersions of two non-miscible liquids (oil and water). The former is thermodynamically stable system in which the inner phase can figure as spheroid, cylinder-like, plane-like, or as a bicontinuous structure [
 <xref rid="B154-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>], whereas the latter is thermodynamically unstable, usually requiring a co-surfactant because its free energy is higher than the free energy of the separate oil and water [
