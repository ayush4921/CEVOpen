<p>Many advantages can be listed when exploiting EOs encapsulation in DDS, such as: increased bioavailability (due to the ability of DDS to adhere to the mucous membrane); protection from hydrolysis and oxidation, thus increasing EO chemical stability; reduction of toxicity and volatility; the possibility of reaching target sites with therapeutic doses, thus increasing the patientâ€™s compliance. Different strategies related to the use of DDS have been explored for the potential encapsulation of EOs, including polymeric nanoparticles and inclusion complexes with cyclodextrins, which have been extensively reviewed [
