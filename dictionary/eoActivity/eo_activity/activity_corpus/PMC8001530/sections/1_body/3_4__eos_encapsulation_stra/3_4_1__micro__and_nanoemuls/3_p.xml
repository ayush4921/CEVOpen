<p>EOs have also demonstrated analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial, anti-fungal, sedative, and antidepressant effects, and through topical application, can effectively heal burns and insect bites [
 <xref rid="B158-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>], therefore they can be used in the treatment of skin wounds. This effect is related to their ability to damage the bacterial cell wall or cell membrane, thus increasing cell membrane permeability and solubilization, with the consequent release of membrane proteins, leading to bacteriostasis [
 <xref rid="B159-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>]. Despite the very promising medicinal activities, some factors limit the pharmaceutical application of EOs as antimicrobial agent in topical treatment, mainly because their directly exposure to the skin could potentially induce an allergic reaction. Moreover, EOs are highly instable and easily degrade when exposed to external factors (oxidation, evaporation, heat, and light) [
 <xref rid="B6-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Furthermore, low aqueous solubility and high volatility limit their free use without a pharmaceutical vehicle. One of the ways to overcome these limits is the use of encapsulation strategies, into vesicular or particulate delivery systems. One strategy consists in the use of micro or nanoemulsions. These vesicular nanosystems have been demonstrated to increase the EOs bioavailability and diffusion—thanks to their small droplets size—and contribute to the antimicrobial and anti-biofilm activities—due to the wetting ability of surfactants [
 <xref rid="B160-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>], since the high surface tension of the droplets favors their fusion with the membranes of prokaryotes, viruses and eukaryotic cell of fungi, leading to the destruction of these organisms [
 <xref rid="B161-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>]. Interestingly, Donsì et al. demonstrated that the nanoencapsulation of terpenes extracted from 
 <italic>Melaleuca alternifolia</italic> improved the antimicrobial activity compared to the unencapsulated mixture, but they also reported that the theoretical higher delivery efficiency of nanoemulsion loaded with terpenes, associated with its smaller mean droplet diameter, is likely counter-balanced by the partial degradation of some active compounds, and in particular, carvacrol [
 <xref rid="B162-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>]. Sugumar and co-workers studied the antimicrobial effect of 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> EO, both in pure form and encapsulated into nanoemulsions [
 <xref rid="B163-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>]. The antibacterial studies of nanoemulsion obtained by sonication against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> by time kill analysis showed complete loss of viability within 15 min of interaction, thus confirming a high interaction with the bacterial membrane and therefore an increase in antimicrobial activity. The integrity of the bacterial membrane was analyzed in the range 0–60 min, showing an immediate loss of cytoplasmic contents of 83.32%. Interestingly, wound contraction activity studies showed better wound-healing activity in animals treated with nanoemulsion (100% wound healing on day 16), compared with the commercially available drug neomycin treated (94.2% healing rate) and control rats, probably due to the ability of the droplets to form a film on the skin after the evaporation of nanoemulsion water phase, and to the presence of cineole in the eucalyptus oil, a well-known penetration enhancer in transdermal DDS and topical application studies [
 <xref rid="B164-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>]. Alam and co-workers investigated the wound contraction activity of clove EO in nanoemulsion by in vivo studies on rats, in comparison to clove EO pure treatment and positive control treated with gentamycin [
 <xref rid="B165-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>]. The collected results demonstrated that the wound contraction and epithelialization time obtained with clove EO-loaded nanoemulsion and gentamycin were comparable, while EO-loaded nanoemulsion results to be more effective than the pure clove EO. The authors also investigated the wound contraction activity of nanoemulsions loaded with 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> EO [
 <xref rid="B166-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>]. Again, the effectiveness of the EO-nanoemulsion was statistically higher compared to the pure EO, reaching epithelization time results similar to those obtained in the treatment with gentamycin. All the results obtained by Alam and co-workers underline that EO encapsulation into nanoemulsion allows increasing the effectiveness in the wound-healing treatment. Recently, the potential application of 
 <italic>Lavandula angustifolia</italic> EO and licorice extracted from 
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic>, in a nanoemulsion delivery system was investigated [
 <xref rid="B167-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>]. In this work, Kazemi et al. demonstrated that this formulation strongly improved the wound-healing process at different stages (wound closure, epithelialization, and molecular processes). In particular, nanoemulsion loaded with 
 <italic>Lavandula angustifolia</italic> EO and licorice extract was able to increase the expression of TGF-β1, type I and type III collagen genes, which are involved in the acceleration of the wound-healing process. The authors attributed this effect to the role of 
 <italic>Lavandula angustifolia</italic> EO on the stimulation of TGF-β1, an important regulatory factor in reproduction fibroblasts which is involved in the formation of granular tissue as well as in the synthesis and accumulation of collagen fibers [
 <xref rid="B167-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>]. EOs-loaded nanoemulsions have also been studied for their potential anti-inflammatory activity by in vitro and in vivo (in zebrafish) assays [
 <xref rid="B39-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B168-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">168</xref>]. In particular, Borges et al. focused on the anti-inflammatory activity of nanoemulsions loaded with 
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> L. EO, exploiting two parameters: the cellular antioxidant activity (CAA) and the nitric oxide (NO∙) production. Interestingly, authors found that the values obtained from the antioxidant activity studies of the pure EO were not significantly different to the one of the respective nanoemulsion, even if the concentration of 
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> L. EO in the nanoemulsion was three times lower compared to the pure EO. The obtained results were correlated to the lipophilicity of the nanoemulsion droplets, which facilitate the penetration into the cell membranes thus promoting the release of EO. Furthermore, Borges et al. demonstrated that 
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> L. EO was able to induce a dose-dependent reduction of NO∙production, whereas a dose-independent effect was observed for nanoemulsions whose activity was greater than pure EO [
 <xref rid="B39-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Therefore, authors concluded that the produced nanoemulsions was able to enhance the anti-inflammatory effect of EO, further reducing the production of NO∙. In particular, the potential pro- or anti-inflammatory effect of EO was investigated on human keratinocytes and fibroblasts, in order to evaluate their safe use for operators [
 <xref rid="B168-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">168</xref>]. Herein, Rossi et al., as well as proving that EOs present a strong toxicity against larvae and pupae of the main malaria vectors 
 <italic>An. stephensi</italic> and 
 <italic>An. gambiae</italic>, in Asia and Africa, also demonstrated that the CBD-free hemp EOs did not induce an inflammatory condition. In particular, these compounds were able to revert the inflammation, reducing the release of the cytokine on skin cell lines, thus demonstrating that they could be safely used by operators [
