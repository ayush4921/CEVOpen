<p>Since past ages, it is well-known that natural substances are able to affect the psychic functions of an individual [
 <xref rid="B92-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. In literature an impressive number of information is reported about the plants employed to treat symptoms related to the most common psychiatric disorders [
 <xref rid="B93-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>,
 <xref rid="B94-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Among these, it is noteworthy to mention the mandrake, whose magical qualities were showed during the Middle ages, probably for its sedative-hypnotics effects or the hellebore, a drug known to treat paranoia, epilepsy [
 <xref rid="B92-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>,
 <xref rid="B95-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>], and also hysterical suffocation which today refers to “functional neurologic symptom disorder” [
 <xref rid="B96-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. In this context, it is remarkable to mention the important traditional drugs extracted from plants, able to affect the central nervous system (CNS). For instance, reserpine isolated from 
 <italic>Rauwolfia serpentina</italic>, has revolutionized schizophrenia treatment [
 <xref rid="B97-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>], as well as morphine, derived from 
 <italic>Papaver somniferum</italic>, which acts to decrease the feeling of pain [
 <xref rid="B98-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. In the past few years, the competition between synthetic and natural drugs has led to the re-evaluation of the plant world, with a significant increase in pharmaceutical plantation investments. In this recent scenario, EOs represent a new challenge by means of their pharmaceutical applications to improve physical, mental, and emotional well-being. The beneficial effects of EOs are achieved by administering (e.g., inhalation, ingestion or cutaneous application) these substances within therapeutic doses, but if these dosages are exceeded, the effects may be harmful to the human body [
 <xref rid="B99-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Inhalation is most commonly used in the acute administration [
 <xref rid="B100-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Remarkably, olfactory system is considered the primordial sensory system in animals: its role is the identification of mixed molecules, present in the environment, to capture new information. To date, the most supported mechanism about olfactory system was described by Linda Buck and Richard Axel. Accordingly, they showed that the detection of distinct odorants may be the result of the association of odorous ligands with specific receptors on olfactory sensory neurons [
 <xref rid="B101-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. In particular, through the inhalation, odorant molecules combine with olfactory receptors (ORs) located on the nasal olfactory epithelium, whence the transmission of signals start from olfactory tracts to the olfactory bulb which, in turn, has a link to the limbic system- mostly with amygdala, responsible for emotional regulation, and hippocampus, involved in memory processes [
 <xref rid="B35-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Therefore, emotional effects of smells can include fear, anxiety, aversion, as well as pleasure or relaxation, through releasing neurotransmitters, such as endorphins, producing a sense of well-being [
 <xref rid="B102-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. For this reason, recent scientific reports suggested benefits in aromatherapy. Accordingly, it is not surprising that today a PubMed search with the keywords “essential oil” results in more than 22,700 publications. In this regard, it is noteworthy to mention Marguerite Maury, one of the first researchers demonstrating the potential effects of EO on the nervous system, mostly in the limbic system [
 <xref rid="B99-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Nowadays aromatherapy is practiced in several countries, including UK, France, USA and Australia, as “
 <italic>complementary therapy</italic>” in association with the traditional medicine. The desire to re-evaluate some traditional forms of medicine as integrative remedy has recently been expressed by the World Health Organization (WHO) (World Health Organization. WHO Traditional Medicine Strategy: 2014–2023, Geneva: WHO; 2014). Considering the effects of EOs at the CNS and according to a plethora of evidences [
 <xref rid="B103-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>,
 <xref rid="B104-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>], the use of EO as supplementary treatment can be a powerful coadjuvant in the care of patients with anxiety disorders [
 <xref rid="B105-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Anxiety disorders, in its pathological meaning, represent one of the most common classes of psychiatric disorders, which impact negatively the quality of people’s life [
 <xref rid="B106-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders, anxiety disorders can be classified into several main types: generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, specific phobia (SP), agoraphobia, selective mutism, social anxiety disorder (SAD) or social phobia, separation anxiety disorder, as described by the American Psychiatric Association. Common comorbidities include mood substance and personality disorders [
 <xref rid="B107-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]; moreover anxiety disorder affects women more easily than men [
 <xref rid="B100-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Psychological, environmental, biological, and genetic factors represent the main causes of predisposition to anxiety disorders [
 <xref rid="B108-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Currently the first and second line treatments for anxiety include 
 <italic>benzodiazepines</italic> (BZD), 
 <italic>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</italic> (SSRI), 
 <italic>serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors</italic> (SNRI), 
 <italic>tricyclic antidepressant</italic> (TCA), 
 <italic>monoamine oxidase inhibitor</italic> (MAOI), up to the most recent atypical antidepressants. Furthermore, innovative compounds are being developed for glutamate, neuropeptide, and endocannabinoid systems [
 <xref rid="B109-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. Although many efforts have been made, unfortunately the most anxiolytic drugs, even if effective, can cause a series of side effects, as well as induction of a state of dependence and tolerability problems. Moreover, another obstacle in the development process of anxiety drugs includes lack of the full understanding of anxiety disorders related physiopathology [
 <xref rid="B110-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. For these reasons, it is essential to consider the additional effective treatments. The use of EOs would seem a promising way to reduce mild anxiety symptoms or at least to potentiate the effect of traditional anxiolytic approaches: accordingly, an innovative “pharmaco-ethology” approach attempting to find drugs with new mechanism of action is needed [
 <xref rid="B111-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. Most of the EOs have been proven to be anxiolytic in clinical trials as well as in animals through the most reliable behavioral models, such as open field (OF) test [
 <xref rid="B112-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>], elevated plus maze (EPM) test [
 <xref rid="B113-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>], social interaction (SI) test [
 <xref rid="B114-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>], light and dark box (LDB) test [
 <xref rid="B115-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>], marble-burying (MB) test [
 <xref rid="B116-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>], etc., and pharmacological approaches to induce anxiety in mice or rats [
 <xref rid="B117-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. Among all the studies reported, 
 <italic>Lavandula angustifolia</italic> (the most used species of lavender) is widely studied also for its anxiolytic effects [
 <xref rid="B118-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. The exposure to lavender smell showed an anxiolytic profile similar to diazepam, mostly in female gerbils [
 <xref rid="B119-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. Investigation of the effects of inhaled linalool, a monoterpene commonly found in several aromatic plant, as well as in 
 <italic>Lavandula angustifolia</italic>, showed anxiolytic properties in mice, increased social interaction, and decreased aggressive behavior [
 <xref rid="B120-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. Results showed that the inhalation of 
 <italic>L. angustifolia</italic> EO had an anxiolytic effect in rats with decrease of freezing, as well as a reduced expression of c-Fos in prefrontal cortex and amygdala [
 <xref rid="B121-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. Shaw et al. compared the effects of lavender oil with the chlordiazepoxide (CDP), as anxiolytic reference, suggesting that lavender oil has anxiolytic effects on rats during the open field test, but that a sedative effect can also occur at the highest doses [
 <xref rid="B122-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. Interestingly, there are also some clinical evidences, which confirm in vivo studies. Karan et al. (Germany), described that the anxiolytic effect of lavender oil inhalation was able to reduce peri-operative anxiety in patients undergoing surgical procedures under local anesthesia [
 <xref rid="B123-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. Kritsidima and co-workers, in a randomized controlled trial on patients, described how the lavender scent reduces state anxiety in dental patients [
 <xref rid="B124-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. A pilot study on the effects of lavender oil on anxiety and depression in the high risk postpartum woman showed a significant improvement of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale after four consecutive weeks of lavender administration [
 <xref rid="B125-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. In another study on forty-five adult outpatients which met the DSM-5 criteria for major depression, anticholinergic side effects of imipramine, such as dry mouth and urinary retention, were observed less often when lavender was administered with that drug, suggesting an effective adjuvant therapy in combination with this latter [
 <xref rid="B126-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. A study including 40 students with Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) problems and 37 students as control groups showed that lavender inhalation could be used to reduce symptoms of PMS, such as anxiety [
 <xref rid="B127-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. Several studies reported pharmacological properties of lavender EO to interact with neuropharmacological targets. Chioca et al. described that serotoninergic transmission, in particular 5-HT1
 <sub>A</sub> receptors, could play an important role in the anxiolytic-like effect of lavender EO. Surprisingly in the same study lavender oil inhalation appeared to attenuate the serotoninergic syndrome induced by SNRI [
 <xref rid="B128-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]. However, other findings suggested that the serotonergic transmission via 5-HT1
 <sub>A</sub>R may not be involved in the anxiolytic effects induced by linalool odor: a potential role of GABAergic transmission was described, especially on GABA-A receptors, enhancing the inhibitory tone of the nervous system [
 <xref rid="B129-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. Other papers suggested a novel mechanism, compared with traditional anxiolytic drugs, in which linalool and linalyl acetate displayed inhibitory activity on Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> influx mediated by voltage-dependent 
 <italic>calcium channels</italic> (VGCCs) [
 <xref rid="B104-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. To date in Germany, the EO extract of 
 <italic>L. angustifolia</italic> for oral administration has been developed, approved and it is a registered drug for the treatment of restlessness accompanying anxious mood. The SLO product (Silexan, W. Spitzner Arzneimittelfabrik GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany) contains the two primary constituents of lavender oil—linalool and linalyl acetate—at concentrations of 36.8% and 34.2%, respectively [
 <xref rid="B105-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>,
 <xref rid="B130-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>,
 <xref rid="B131-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]. This drug has significant anxiolytic and sleep-improving effects not associated with sedation [
 <xref rid="B132-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>] and also the absence of potential dependency [
 <xref rid="B133-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. Lavender, as well as a lot of EOs (
 <xref rid="pharmaceutics-13-00327-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), is “generally recognized as safe” (GRAS) as a food by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In general, lavender is well tolerated, but more information is needed, as well the safety on the excretion of some lavender components into breastmilk. Because different or also identical chemotypes can have very different chemical components, it is not surprising that linalool is not the only one having anxiolytic action (
 <xref rid="pharmaceutics-13-00327-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). According to the available clinical studies, 
 <italic>Citrus aurantium</italic> EO on the treatment of anxiety, in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) [
 <xref rid="B134-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>], as well as in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) [
 <xref rid="B135-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>] showed a reduction of symptoms associated with anxiety. Also, 
 <italic>Citrus sinensis</italic> and 
 <italic>Citrus bergamia</italic> EO demonstrated positive effects against signs of mild anxiety [
 <xref rid="B136-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. In another studies the researchers assessed the effect of 
 <italic>Rosa damascene</italic> EO, showing a reduction of anxiety and pain in the first stage of labor [
 <xref rid="B137-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>], as well as 
 <italic>Osmanthus fragrans</italic> oil and grapefruit oil were effective complementary treatments for anxious patients undergoing colonoscopy [
 <xref rid="B138-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. Tankam and co-workers investigated the potential of 
 <italic>Piper guineense</italic> EO in mice, demonstrating that its inhalation could induce a mild tranquilizing effect [
 <xref rid="B139-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. Other studies suggested that lemon oil possesses anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effects, probably through the suppression of DA activity related to enhanced 5-HTergic neurons [
 <xref rid="B140-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. Zhang et al. showed an anxiolytic effect on male mice after inhalation of 
 <italic>Cananga odorata</italic> EO (ylang-ylang EO) [
 <xref rid="B141-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>]. Another study analyzed the potential anxiolytic properties of inhaled coriander volatile oil, extracted from 
 <italic>Coriandrum sativum</italic>, on a rat model of Alzheimer’s disease [
 <xref rid="B142-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. Forms of emotional memory associated to anxiety states were observed in a pilot study on postpartum women, demonstrating a reduction of anxiety levels using a rose/lavender oil blend for 15 min twice weekly during 4 weeks [
 <xref rid="B125-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. Even if our purpose is to discuss about aromatherapy, it is noteworthy to admit that all the anxiolytic-like effects in animal models have been obtained also through oral or IP administration [
 <xref rid="B143-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>,
 <xref rid="B144-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>,
 <xref rid="B145-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>,
 <xref rid="B146-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>]. Evidence suggests that aromatherapy might be used as a complementary treatment, however some papers seem to support the ineffectiveness of Eos. For instance, Fazlollahpour and co-workers described that inhalation of aromatherapy with 4% rose EO could not significantly alleviate anxiety in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery [
 <xref rid="B147-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. Another study trials conducted in 2007 did not demonstrate a statistically significant relationship between the use of EOs and anxiety reduction [
 <xref rid="B148-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>].
