<p>The treatment of microbial infections has always been one of the highest and most ambitious goals in the pharmacological field. The ability of microorganisms to continuously develop new drug resistance mechanisms makes this an ever-evolving field. In fact, the resistance toward antibiotics is one of the main impediments to perform an appropriate treatment for certain infections. Despite the availability of many classes of antibiotics, and therefore a large number of molecules, today this problem is increasingly relevant and alternative therapies, such as EOs, are being investigated to overcome it. Even Hippocrates, more than two thousand years ago, affirmed that the fumigation of EOs was useful to protect from the plague [
 <xref rid="B3-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This was proved in the Middle Ages when some gangs of robbers, due to the assumption of tinctures containing EOs, were able to steal from the houses of the plague victims without being infected. For this reason, EOs have been extensively studied and have been considered as a valid alternative therapy against bacterial infections. The antibacterial activity of EOs depends on the presence of certain components, especially mono- and sesquiterpenes, which are known as efficient antimicrobial agents [
 <xref rid="B52-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Moreover, the highest antibacterial activity belongs to phenolic groups, followed by cinnamic aldehydes. Other groups are also important, including alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, ethers, and hydrocarbons [
 <xref rid="B53-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]; specifically, antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria is related to the amount of long-chain alcohols and aldehydes, as stated by Shojaee-Aliabadi [
 <xref rid="B52-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], while antimicrobial activity of alcohols is directly proportional to their molecular weight [
 <xref rid="B52-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="B54-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Many EOs have been studied to determine their effectiveness as antibacterial, and the most commonly used assays are the diameter of the inhibition zone (DIZ) evaluation, by measuring the halo diameter, and the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and/or minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), through the microdilution method. The research conducted by Hammer et al. [
 <xref rid="B55-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] demonstrated the antimicrobial activity of a large number of plant oils and extracts, derived from 37 genera, which were investigated against different kinds of microorganisms, such as 
 <italic>Acinetobacter baumanii</italic>, 
 <italic>Aeromonas veronii biogroup sobria</italic>, 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic>, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, or 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. As a result, tested EOs and plant extracts have demonstrated in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activity against a wide range of organisms, comprising Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and a yeast [
 <xref rid="B55-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Particularly relevant were the results obtained by 
 <italic>Cymbopogon citratus</italic>, 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic>, and 
 <italic>Pimenta racemosa</italic> EOs. 
 <italic>Aniba rosaeodora</italic>, 
 <italic>Coriandrum sativum</italic>, 
 <italic>Cymbopogon martinii</italic>, 
 <italic>Melaleuca alternifolia</italic>, 
 <italic>Melaleuca quinquenervia</italic>, 
 <italic>Mentha piperita</italic>, 
 <italic>Mentha spicata</italic>, 
 <italic>Salvia officinalis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Origanum majorana</italic> results were also noteworthy. The lowest MIC value (0.008% 
 <italic>v/v</italic>) was measured by 
 <italic>Vetiveria zizanioides</italic> against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, while 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> showed a great activity against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, with a MIC value of 0.03% 
 <italic>v/v</italic>. Moreover, the study carried out by Nikolić, Jovanović et al. [
 <xref rid="B56-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] confirmed a significant antimicrobial activity of five EOs 
 <italic>Mentha piperita</italic>, 
 <italic>Mentha pulegium</italic>, 
 <italic>Lavandula angustifolia</italic>, 
 <italic>Satureja montana</italic>, and 
 <italic>Salvia lavandulifolia</italic>. Seven bacterial species—namely 
 <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic>, 
 <italic>Streptococcus sanguis</italic>, 
 <italic>Streptococcus salivarius</italic>, 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Lactobacillus acidophilus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Enterecoccus faecalis</italic>—as well as fifty-eight clinical oral 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp. were subjected to the treatment with these EOs, confirming their potentiality as antibacterial agent [
 <xref rid="B56-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The antimicrobial potential of the tested EOs increased in the order: 
 <italic>L. angustifolia</italic> &lt; 
 <italic>M. pulegium</italic> &lt; 
 <italic>S. lavandulifolia</italic> &lt; 
 <italic>M. piperita</italic> &lt; 
 <italic>S. montana</italic>. 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B57-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. As extensively reported by Bilia et al. [
 <xref rid="B58-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], 
 <italic>Artemisia annua</italic> has showed great antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and also fungi. The review deeply describes the interesting studies on different Gram-positive bacterial strains, with the lowest MIC values reported for 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Enterococcus hirae</italic>, 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp. (all ranging from 0.00781 mg/mL of 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> to 0.053 mg/mL of 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic>). Gram-negative lowest MIC values were 0.013 mg/mL of 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 0.026 mg/mL of UPEC (
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> Uropathogenic), and 0.025 mg/mL of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Furthermore, the most susceptible fungi were described to be 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, with a 2 mg/mL MIC value. The interesting antimicrobial property of 
 <italic>Artemisia annua</italic> is strictly related to all its components as a whole. In fact, the same research group further analyzed the antimicrobial activity of its main components (artemisia ketone, 1,8-cineole and camphor), in comparison with the whole EO [
 <xref rid="B59-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Disk diffusion method and broth microdilution assay were performed on the most common food pathogens, namely 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Salmonella enteritidis</italic>, 
 <italic>Salmonella typhi</italic>, 
 <italic>Yersinia enterocolitica</italic>, and 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>. As expected, the components separately tested were not able to perform as well as the entire EO, even if the values of the diameters of inhibition zones and the obtained MBC values were remarkable, thus suggesting that the synergism and/or antagonism occurring between the components is necessary to achieve such a great antimicrobial activity. Zhang et al. analyzed the antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>Melaleuca alternifolia</italic> EO in different strains: 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Penicillium italicum</italic> Wehmer, and 
 <italic>Penicillium digitatum</italic> Sacc. [
 <xref rid="B60-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The EO showed a good antimicrobial activity toward all the tested strains, with a slightly more pronounced action toward Gram-positive bacteria, compared to Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. This is not surprising since it is known that the wall of Gram-positive bacteria simply consists of several layers of peptidoglycan, while the wall of Gram-negative bacteria has an additional hydrophilic outer wall; for this reason EOs components, which are mainly hydrophobic, find it difficult to penetrate inside the Gram-negative cells [
 <xref rid="B61-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Thus, authors demonstrated that the presence of hydrophobic terpenes is critical for Gram-positive antibacterial action, as previously stated by Cox [
 <xref rid="B62-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Moreover, terpenes’ mechanism of action was verified in altering the permeability of the membrane by interacting with the lipid components, thus inducing cell death [
 <xref rid="B62-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. A similar mechanism of action was found for 
 <italic>Cinnamomum glanduliferum</italic> EO [
 <xref rid="B63-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], tested against some Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains, and also some fungi. Through the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) assay performed by Taha et al. on 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, there emerged an irreversible damage in the cell membrane. According to the evidence obtained from this study, another plausible mechanism of action involves the blockage of the production of some important enzymes, such as protease and amylase, leading to cell components coagulation [
 <xref rid="B64-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,
 <xref rid="B65-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,
 <xref rid="B66-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,
 <xref rid="B67-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. These phenomena are also used by fungi, which are able to cause the destruction of the cell membrane even through the ability to inhibit the production of cellular energy and to create a pH gradient between the cell and the external medium. These phenomena, in this particular EO context, are caused by the great amount of eucalyptol, and also due to the significant presence of other terpenes (terpinen-4-ol and α-terpineol); these three major compounds, as the author suggested, were responsible for the antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>Cinnamomum glanduliferum</italic> EO. Insawang and co-workers compared five cultivars of 
 <italic>Lavandula stoechas</italic>, in order to assess the differences in their antimicrobial behavior against some bacterial strains [
 <xref rid="B68-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. This study is a further confirmation that the presence of eucalyptol (and terpenes in general) is crucial for the antimicrobial activity of the EO. Thymol and carvacrol have been investigated for their antimicrobial properties by Pesavento and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B69-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], who reported the antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> EO on opportunistic respiratory pathogens. In this work, 59 bacterial strains belonging to 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</italic>, and 
 <italic>Achromobacter xylosoxidans</italic> species were subjected to the treatment with 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> EO [
 <xref rid="B69-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. All strains resulted to be highly susceptible, even in the treatment with low EO concentrations. In particular, a 48-h-long treatment with a 0.5% 
 <italic>v/v</italic> concentration of the EO was able to completely inhibit (100%) the growth of 
 <italic>A. xylosoxidans</italic>, 
 <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> and multi-resistant 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA). Interestingly, the selected strains belonged to different bacterial species or genera, and it emerged that none of them muted becoming resistant: these findings suggested that the broad activity of 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> EO could be achieved through the interaction with multiple cellular targets, thus minimizing the possible occurrence of mutant-resistant strains. These results encourage a possible use of 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> EO in the treatment of multidrug-resistant cystic fibrosis (CF) pathogens, as suggested by the authors [
 <xref rid="B69-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>].
