<p>Inflammation is an essential biological mechanism, which provides a response to harmful stimuli coming from the outside. The inflammation can be acute, when the stimulus produces a limited response over time, and therefore ends within a few days. It may also be chronic, if the external insult persists over time, the person is particularly sensitive or suffers from autoimmune pathologies. Acute inflammation is characterized by five symptoms: 
 <italic>calor</italic> (increase in local vascularization with elevation of the temperature), 
 <italic>tumor</italic> (formation of an exudate, which causes oedema), 
 <italic>rubor</italic> (active hyperaemia causing redness), 
 <italic>dolor</italic> (the inflammatory components of exudate cause stimulation of sensorial nerves and compression), and 
 <italic>functio laesa</italic> (impairment of the functionality of the inflamed tissue). Chronic inflammation is mainly caused by the migration, into tissues, of mononuclear blood cells, such as monocytes and lymphocytes. The most effective therapy is the etiological one, acting on the cause of the inflammation, for example by administering an antibiotic if the cause is an infection. If this is not enough, or if the cause is not clear, traditional anti-inflammatory drugs are also used. They belong to two categories: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids. Especially when treating chronic inflammation, prolonged intake of these drugs could produce significant adverse effects, such as ulcers and gastritis for NSAIDs, or the risk of over-infection using glucocorticoids. For this reason, there is now a growing interest in the use of natural compounds as adjuvants for these therapies, especially chronic ones. The importance of natural medicines in the treatment of many inflammatory diseases has always been well-known. The “water of the Queen of Hungary”, an infusion of rosemary EO, dates back to the 16th century, as Queen Isabell used it to cure rheumatism; it was at the court of Louis XIV that this preparation spread in the form of medicine [
 <xref rid="B39-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Many other historical evidences, linked to traditional medicine, indicate the use of rosemary EO to treat inflammatory conditions of different nature, like rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, bronchitis, etc., [
 <xref rid="B39-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. One of the most commonly used in vivo model to analyze the anti-inflammatory power of EOs is the carrageenan-induced pleurisy experiment: a group of mice is pre-treated with the EO, while the others are monitored as positive and negative control; each mouse is treated with the inflammatory agent, which in this situation is carrageenan, and, at defined intervals, the paw oedema is measured. Using the above mentioned model, Ogunwande et al. analyzed 
 <italic>Bougainvillea glabra</italic> EO to assess its effectiveness as an anti-inflammatory agent [
 <xref rid="B42-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The groups of mice were treated with different concentrations of the EO and then compared with the standard group (treated with diclofenac) and the control group (administered with saline solution). Anti-inflammatory activity of the EO was demonstrated, and it was related to its ability of inhibiting both histamine- and prostaglandins-mediated responses. Besides carrageenan, it is also possible to use dextran as an inflammatory agent, as operated by Rodrigues and co-workers who exploited both experiments to analyze 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> EO [
 <xref rid="B43-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In the same work, also histamine and arachidonic acid were used as a model to analyze their inflammatory pathways. All doses administered, even lower ones, showed excellent anti-inflammatory properties in all the performed experiments. Also, 
 <italic>Cinnamomum osmophloeum</italic> Kanehira leaf EO demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity, due to the presence of the two main components, cinnamaldehyde and linalool. In another study, some mice were pre-treated with one of the two compounds and then all were injected with endotoxin to activate the inflammatory pathway [
 <xref rid="B44-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The results obtained from these analyses were consistent and extremely detailed: in mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen, pre-treated mice have developed fewer inflammation mediators than the non-treated ones, including interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-18, interferon (IFN)-γ, nitrate/nitrite, etc. Furthermore, the expression of different genes, proteins, receptors, and enzymes, induced by endotoxin, was suppressed. 
 <italic>Artemisia argyi</italic> EO was widely used in China for the treatment of chronic bronchitis, due to the anti-inflammatory activity of his components, as asserted by Chen et al. [
 <xref rid="B45-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Among many others, they proved that the dose-dependent anti-inflammatory activity of 
 <italic>Artemisia argyi</italic> EO is linked to the inhibition of two important events: the release of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as TNF-α, IL-6, IFN-β, NO, PGE2, etc., and the phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT1/3. The suppression of JAK/STATs pathway also demonstrated the antioxidant property of this EO against reactive oxygen species (ROS). Upon this point, besides the anti-inflammatory properties of EOs, experienced for centuries, in a more contemporary age, the researchers’ interest has also focused on the antioxidant properties. Oxidation occurs when the balance between free radicals and antioxidants is shifted toward the oxidizing species. Free radicals could induce a plethora of biological events, affecting various cell’s components, like DNA or proteins, thus inducing several consequential pathologies, such as cancers, neurodegenerative diseases and chronic inflammation disorders. Certainly, environmental, dietary or lifestyle conditions could result in an increased amount of radical species produced by the organism and, therefore, in a condition of oxidative stress. It is well-known that through diet it is possible to compensate the inadequacy of endogenous antioxidants by consuming foods rich in vitamin A, C, and E, resveratrol, lycopene, and so on. The benefits of antioxidant supplementation are still subject of debate and further investigation, as an attempt is nowadays focused to quantify the extent of this improvement. Many EOs have antioxidant properties, and the use of EOs as natural antioxidants is a field of growing interest because some synthetic antioxidants such as butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) are now suspected to be potentially harmful to human health. Addition of EOs to edible products, either by direct mixing or in active packaging and edible coatings, may therefore represent a valid alternative to prevent autoxidation and to prolong shelf life. The evaluation of the antioxidant performance of EOs still represents a crucial issue, because many commonly used “tests” are inappropriate and give contradictory results that may mislead future research. The chemistry explaining EO antioxidant activity is discussed along with an analysis of the potential in food protection. Literature methods to assess EOs antioxidant performance are critically reviewed. Currently, antioxidants have become essential in nutrition because of their ability to protect the body against oxidative cell damage that can produce dangerous diseases. EOs are one of the major sources of different bioactive molecules that directly act on the body. Literature studies describe a variety of approaches to demonstrate the antioxidant power of EOs. Among the most common essays we can identify the DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical) method: this radical is characterized by an absorption band at 515 nm, which changes after the administration of an antioxidant; the radical scavenger activity of a compound is often quantified as IC
 <sub>50</sub>, which is the amount of antioxidant necessary to halve the absorbance of the DPPH. This method was used by Silva and co-workers, who analyzed lavender EO, extracted from 
 <italic>Lavandula augustifolia</italic> [
 <xref rid="B46-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. As an antioxidant, lavender EO showed good IC
 <sub>50</sub> values, indicating that antioxidant activity is dose dependent, with a peak of activity associated with concentration of 150, 120, and 100 mg/mL. Da Silva also investigated the anti-inflammatory activity of lavender EO performing the carrageenan assay on mice, comparing it to saline solution as negative control and dexamethasone as positive control. The leukocytes diminishing effect was qualitatively similar to that produced by dexamethasone, which, however, proved to be more effective. The author suggested an involvement of a G protein-coupled receptor and/or phospholipase C/inositol phosphate messenger. Another species of lavender EO, 
 <italic>Lavandula x intermedia</italic> “Sumian”, was studied by Carbone and co-workers [
 <xref rid="B47-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] together with 
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> L. and 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>hirtum</italic> EO, to assess their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) analysis indicated that only 
 <italic>Origanum</italic> possesses a remarkable antioxidant activity, with a value of 216 μg/mL of Trolox equivalents. This is certainly attributable to the presence of large amounts of phenolic compounds, which, on the other hand, are scarcely present in 
 <italic>Lavandula</italic> and 
 <italic>Rosmarinus</italic>. The same study also demonstrated the anti-inflammatory activity of the three EOs, in the following order: 
 <italic>Lavandula</italic> &gt; 
 <italic>Rosmarinus</italic> ≥ 
 <italic>Origanum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B47-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Another widely used reagent is the 2,2-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) cationic radical, whose protocol of use also consists in measuring the variation of the specific absorbance. It was used by Elaguel et al., in conjunction with the DPPH method and phosphomolybdenum assay, for demonstrating the antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>Lawsonia inermis</italic> EO, thus suggesting the EO possible application as adjuvant in anti-cancer therapies [
 <xref rid="B48-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. DPPH and ABTS assays were also used to confirm the antioxidant property of the EO extracted from blossoms of 
 <italic>Citrus aurantium</italic> L. var. 
 <italic>amara</italic> Engl. (CAVAO), which has also shown an even more marked anti-inflammatory activity, that could be exploited for the development of functional foods to be used in patients with inflammatory diseases [
 <xref rid="B49-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Another assay worth mentioning is the ferric-reducing ability of plasma (FRAP), which measures the ability to cause ferric reduction. Together with other assays, it was useful to analyze the main active components of 
 <italic>Anethum graveolens</italic> seed EO, which were demonstrated to be carvone, limonene, and camphor, thus showing that carvone is an excellent antioxidant due to the presence of unsaturated hydroxyl group [
 <xref rid="B50-pharmaceutics-13-00327" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Furthermore, the antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>Mentha spicata</italic> was confirmed by performing FRAP and ABTS assays, suggesting a possible use of this EO in the pharmaceutical field [
