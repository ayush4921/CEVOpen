<p>Essential oils (EOs) have been known for millennia: during the Neolithic Age (before 4000 B.C.) they were extracted from plants by simple squeezing and this was the turning point that gave rise to the sedentary lifestyle. This led to the construction of the first sacred monuments where EOs were used in rituals. Besides clay cuneiform writing pieces (2600 B.C.) discovered in Mesopotamia, one of the oldest discoveries that proves the use of EOs for medical purposes is an Egyptian papyrus dated 2551–2528 B.C. [

Moreover, the Egyptians used aromatic oils for beauty treatments and spiritual rituals, including the ceremony of mummification; the use of EOs has allowed a good preservation of some mummies. Generally, the Egyptians used to extract oils by infusion of the plant in a fatty substance and consequent boiling, in this way, the aroma evaporated and fixed itself in the fat [

Based on some evidences, they were aware of an oil extraction procedure by distillation, even if this was not commonly used. “Shennong’s Herbal” is the oldest medical book, dating back to 2700 B.C. and belonging to the Chinese tradition: it contains the usage guidelines for 365 plants. China is still the world’s leading producer of EOs. The use of EOs has been a fundamental part of Indian medical practice for five thousand years. Ayurveda is a traditional book that describes the use, both medical and religious, of over 700 different types of plants, and it is still the basis of the Indian healthcare [

He strongly believed in the medical benefits of fumigation with aromatic oils in the treatment of the plague; he was also convinced that the topical use of aromatic preparations could produce systemic effects. Romans, under the influence of Greeks, used EOs for bathing and massages. Among the findings belonging to Romans, there is an interesting treatise on herbal medicine dating back to the first century A.D., De Materia Medica, in which Pedanius Dioscorides reported more than 600 remedies [

During the Middle Ages, the Catholic Church banned the use of EOs for medical treatment: those who used them were burned at the stake, because they were associated to witchcraft. Despite the persecutions, the monks secretly kept the tradition [

In the 17th century, the use of natural extracts was abandoned due to the discovery of chemical substances. The interest in EOs was rekindled in 1928 thanks to Rene-Maurice Gattefossé, who coined the term “Aromatheraphie” and discovered the healing properties of lavender EO. In 1990, the book “L’Aromatherapie Exactement” was published, in which Daniel Pénoël and Pierre Franchomme reported the medical properties of more than 270 EOs, and this was the starting point for many studies.
