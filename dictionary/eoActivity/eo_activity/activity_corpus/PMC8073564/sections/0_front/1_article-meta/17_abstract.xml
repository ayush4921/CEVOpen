 <p>The interest of consumers in using products containing phytochemicals derived from plants is growing day by day due to the shift of consumersâ€™ preferences from convenience to environmental sustainability. One plant utilized in many products is 
  <italic>Centella asiatica</italic>, a herb commonly used in folk medicine, health supplements, and beauty products. Extraction of bioactive compounds from 
  <italic>C. asiatica</italic> was performed using conventional methods and modern methods (e.g., microwave or ultrasound-assisted and subcritical water extraction). This review summarizes the variety of methods used to extract active compounds from 
  <italic>C. asiatica</italic>, their influence on the bioactive compounds and antimicrobial activity in vitro and in vivo, and the safety and toxicology of 
  <italic>C. asiatica</italic> extract.
