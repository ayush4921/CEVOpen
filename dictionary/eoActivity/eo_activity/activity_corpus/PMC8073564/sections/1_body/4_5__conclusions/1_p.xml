<p>Several methods have been used to extract compounds from 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic>. The efficiency of extraction is based on the extraction method, extraction solvent, and extraction time. The desired compounds extracted also influence the choice of extraction method aside from cost and availability. Among the applications, the antimicrobial action of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> has been widely studied, mostly in extracts obtained conventionally. To date, very few microbial species have been tested using 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> extracts obtained by modern extraction techniques. Thus, more studies are necessary for these extracts to determine their effect on microorganisms. The modern extraction techniques also seem to be more promising for obtaining antimicrobial compounds in terms of cost, time, and better efficacy toward certain microbes compared to conventional techniques. In particular, solventless extraction hinders the possible retention of the chemical solvent in the extract. Therefore, the extracts obtained from these modern techniques are worthy as antimicrobial agents. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> possesses antimicrobial activity, although there have been few in vivo studies due to their complexity. Nevertheless, the extracts have the potential to be used in the medicinal, cosmeceutical, and food sectors.
