<p>Microwave extraction is a technique that utilizes fast heating of aqueous samples. The key concept of the method is that the solvent absorbs the microwave energy, which is then transferred in the form of heat to the sample [

Extraction of active compounds from the sample to solvent is influenced predominantly by the temperature and the nature of the solvent.
