<p>Methanol extract of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> leaf has more constituents (alkaloids, terpenoids, glycosides, steroids, tannins, flavonoids, and reducing sugars) than the acetone extract (no terpenoids) and chloroform extract (no tannins). However, UAE using those three solvents is unable to extract saponins [

 <xref rid="B71-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] also showed that a better extract yield was obtained with binary solvent (40:60 ethanol–water) than with pure solvent (100% water and 100% ethanol). Increased yield of TPC and TFC, and DPPH antioxidant activity was proportional to an increase in temperature, but above 45 °C, DPPH scavenging activity decreased drastically while TPC and TFC yield was maintained [
 <xref rid="B71-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. The high recovery of phenolic and flavonoid compounds using the UAE technique causes a high percentage of DPPH scavenging activity, which is an important assay to test antioxidant properties. The disadvantage of this technique is the long exposure of the sample to ultrasound activity, which may degrade the yield of asiaticoside and asiatic acid [
