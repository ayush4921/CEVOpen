<p>Contrary to classical heating, microwaves heat the whole sample concurrently. Microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) is a process that operates under higher temperature and in an oxygen-rich environment. It is an excellent technique for reducing the time and solvent consumed to extract target compounds compared to conventional methods [
