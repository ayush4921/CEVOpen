<p>Maceration is a technique in which plant materials are soaked in a solvent at a specific temperature and time [
 <xref rid="B57-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The extract from this method is concentrated using a rotary evaporator to obtain the final solvent-free crude extract. This process softens the plant cells and eventually releases the bioactive compounds from the cells. The solvent used for maceration is based on the study objectives. Maceration is a simple extraction method and has broad applicability. However, it has a long extraction time, high temperature, high mass transfer resistance, low extraction efficiency, and requires a large volume of solvent [
