<p>Soxhlet extraction is a technique used to obtain semi-volatile and non-volatile compounds from 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> [
 <xref rid="B64-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. In this method, the herb is placed in a thimble or porous bag in the Soxhlet rig. The extracting solvent in a round-bottomed flask is boiled at the desired temperature and its vapors are condensed in a condenser. The cooled vapor drips onto the sample of herbs and extracts by contact. When the liquid in the thimble rises to the overflow level, a siphon aspirates the solution into the round-bottomed flask. This cycle is continued for several hours until an adequate phytochemical is acquired. The solvent mixture is then concentrated by a rotary evaporator. Since the sample is frequently exposed to the solvent, and the temperature of the extraction is higher than room temperature, more analytes can be extracted from the sample. Additionally, no filtration is required. The downsides of this method are that it involves a long extraction time, and a large amount of solvent is consumed, which is expensive to dispose of and can cause environmental pollution [

 <xref rid="B44-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The long extraction time and high temperature increase the probability of thermolabile substances being degraded [
 <xref rid="B34-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. It has also become an unattractive method for analyzing a high number of samples due to its long extraction time, and samples can only be extracted one at a time for each apparatus.
