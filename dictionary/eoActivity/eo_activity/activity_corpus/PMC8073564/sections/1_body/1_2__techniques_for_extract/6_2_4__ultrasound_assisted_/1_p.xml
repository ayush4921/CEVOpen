<p>Ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) is an extraction method in which ultrasonic waves produce acoustic cavitation in the solvent and cause the disruption of cells. This disruption promotes the release of bioactive compounds and enhances the contact surface area between solid and liquid phases [

 <xref rid="B68-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Ultrasound causes surface exfoliation, abrasion, and particle disintegration, which increase the mass transfer from the cell cytoplasm to the surrounding solvent [

 <xref rid="B51-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. This method is the best approach to recover a high yield of phenolic and flavonoid compounds with the highest antioxidant activity such as betacyanin and anthocyanin, and lipids and protein [
 <xref rid="B69-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. It is also highly efficient and causes less destruction of the bioactive compounds since elevated temperature is not used [
 <xref rid="B70-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Thus, it is applicable for extracting thermolabile and unstable compounds [
