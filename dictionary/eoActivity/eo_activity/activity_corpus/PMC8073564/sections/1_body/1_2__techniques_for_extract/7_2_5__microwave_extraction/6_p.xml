<p>A study by Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B56-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] on enzymatic pretreatment and microwave extraction (EPME), combining enzymolysis and microwave extraction, showed that it has high extraction efficiency, takes less time, and is an environmentally friendly way of extracting asiaticoside from 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic>. However, the downside of this technique is that it is expensive because enzymes are used, and the complexity of industrializing EPME would restrict further application.
