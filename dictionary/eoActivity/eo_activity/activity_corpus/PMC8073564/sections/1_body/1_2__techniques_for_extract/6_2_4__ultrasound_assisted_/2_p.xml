<p>Sellathoroe et al. [
 <xref rid="B52-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] found that UAE gives a higher yield than both Soxhlet and maceration methods for an extract consisting of 0.34% terpenoids, 0.47% saponins, 0.03% alkaloids, and 0.11% flavonoids, as shown in

 <xref rid="B52-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. A study by Nithyanandam et al. [
 <xref rid="B71-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] demonstrated that UAE is the best extraction method for 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> for the significant recovery of antioxidant compounds. Furthermore, the extract contained 79% 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity, a total phenolic content (TPC) of 1350 mg GAE/100 g DW, and total flavonoid content (TFC) of 599 mg CE/100 g DW, all of which were higher than those obtained using maceration, Soxhlet, and hot-water extraction. This method also extracted 9.24 ± 0.88% of bioactive compounds, which increased to 11.80 ± 0.58% using focused high ultrasound, of which 30.21% was polyphenols [
