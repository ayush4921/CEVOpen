<p>Soxhlet extraction has also been used to obtain the crude extract of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic>, which will be later screened for its antimicrobial activity. Several organic solvents such as hexane, chloroform, methanol [

 <xref rid="B65-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], and water [
 <xref rid="B11-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] have been used in the extraction for this purpose. Byakodi et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] discovered that the methanolic extract of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> from the Soxhlet method contained phenols, tannins, flavonoids, terpenoids, saponin, and alkaloids. Another study by Thamarai Selvi et al. [
 <xref rid="B47-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] found that 500 g of powdered 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> subjected to Soxhlet extraction for 8 h using an ethanol to solid ratio of 1:4 resulted in extracts containing saponins, terpenoids, alkaloids, and phenols but no steroids, flavonoids, tannins, proteins, carbohydrates, or glycosides. In a preliminary phytochemical screening of the 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> extract, Jayaprakash and Nagarajan [
 <xref rid="B65-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] discovered the existence of alkaloids, saponins, flavonoids, phenols, steroids, tannins, glycosides, triterpenoids, and terpenoids. The extract also contained 1–8% saponins, 0.1% volatile oils, triterpenic acids (e.g., terminolic acid, brahmic acid, centellic acid, madasiatic acid), and glycosides (e.g., madasiaticoside, brahminoside, centelloside) [

 <xref rid="B50-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] used 100% ethanol, 50% ethanol, and water as solvents for Soxhlet extraction to obtain total polyphenols, flavonoids, β-carotene, tannins, and vitamin C from 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic>. The study showed that the 50% ethanol extract of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> contained a significantly higher amount of polyphenols and flavonoids while 100% ethanol extracted the highest amount of β-carotene and tannins. On the other hand, the water extract of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> contained more vitamin C than the 50 and 100% ethanol extracts (
