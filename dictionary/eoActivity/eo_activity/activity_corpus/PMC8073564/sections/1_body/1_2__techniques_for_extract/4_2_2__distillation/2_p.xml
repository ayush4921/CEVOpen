<p>Steam distillation using distilled water and vinegar has been used to extract dry and fresh leaves of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic>. Steam distillation is an efficient technique for obtaining the best quality of oil, and by employing fresh leaves over dry leaves in extraction, many constituents can be detected [

 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> obtained by Florczak [
 <xref rid="B44-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] from steam distillation yielded more sesquiterpenoid hydrocarbons; 43 constituents were identified, representing 98.60% of the composition of the oil. On the other hand, water distillation is an excellent method for extracting caryophyllene and monoterpenoid hydrocarbons from 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic>; 54 constituents were identified, representing 98.29% of the total composition. However, water distillation utilizes a tremendous amount of water besides consuming a lot of energy and time [
 <xref rid="B62-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. A study by Orhan et al. [
 <xref rid="B63-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] successfully extracted 47 components representing 88.9% of the essential oil. The dominant compound was α-copaene (22.0%), followed by alloaromadendrene (7.6%), β-caryophyllene (7.1%), α-humulene (6.7%), and β-cubebene (5.9%). Paudel et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] discovered that distillation of 85 g of dry 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> leaves for 4 h extracted a 0.05% yield of essential oil composed of 33 compounds. The essential oil was rich in sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (74.1%) and oxygenated sesquiterpenoids (13.0%), the most abundant compounds being β-farnesene (26.5%), α-humulene (20.9%), β-caryophyllene (13.3%), and falcarinone (8.8%) (
