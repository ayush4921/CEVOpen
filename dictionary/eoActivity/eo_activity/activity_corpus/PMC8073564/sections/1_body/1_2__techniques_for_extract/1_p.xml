<p>Extraction is the separation of medicinally active compounds from plant parts using selective solvents through chosen procedures, leaving behind the insoluble compounds. The extracts after solvent removal are obtained in liquid form or as a dry powder consisting of a mixture of compounds. In general, the extraction of plant material is done by washing out the analyte from the matrix into the solvent and diffusion through the cell wall [

 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> have been published in Scopus, mainly from India (305), China (191), Malaysia (153), Indonesia (80), and Thailand (66). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00457-f001">Figure 1</xref> shows that the number of publications on 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> extraction has increased during the period, thus proving the interest in this plant. Several methods for preparing 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> extracts have been reported, for example, the one developed by Duval [
 <xref rid="B35-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], who used at least 30 wt.% of an alcoholic solvent in the extraction to obtain a mixture of madecassoside and terminoloside in a refined extract of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic>. Kim et al. [
 <xref rid="B36-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] patented a method to obtain a water-soluble extract of asiaticoside and madecassoside from 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic>; Loiseau et al. [
 <xref rid="B37-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] reported a method to obtain an extract consisting of a mixture of madecassoside, asiaticoside, and terminoloside that was more than 75 wt.% relative to the extract total weight, and an extract consisting of a mixture of madecassoside and terminoloside that was more than 95 wt.% pure relative to the total weight of the mixture.
