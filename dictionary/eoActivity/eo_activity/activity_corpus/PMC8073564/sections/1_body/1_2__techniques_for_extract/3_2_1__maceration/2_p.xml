<p>In the case of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic>, organic solvents like ethanol, methanol, or a mixture of alcohol and water are typically used. Aqueous extracts obtained by this technique usually show antioxidant and cytotoxic activity [

 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> are extracted for a few days [

 <italic>C. asiatica</italic>. Maceration of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> is also able to extract various types of compounds such as triterpenoids, flavonoids, phenolics, saponins, alkaloids, tannins, and carotenoids, primarily based on the solvents used and period of extraction [
