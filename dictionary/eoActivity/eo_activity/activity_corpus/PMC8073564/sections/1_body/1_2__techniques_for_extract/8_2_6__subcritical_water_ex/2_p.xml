<p>There are not many studies on the compounds, in vitro analysis, or in vivo analysis of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> obtained by subcritical water extraction. A study by Kim et al. [
 <xref rid="B40-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] on the extraction of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> with the subcritical water extraction method demonstrated a rise in the concentration of asiatic acid from 0 to 7.0 mg/g, and in that of asiaticoside from 1.1 to 8.4 mg/g, when the temperature was increased from 100 to 250 Â°C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00457-f007">Figure 7</xref>). The enhanced solubility and enhanced transport properties of subcritical water at a higher temperature may be responsible for the higher extraction yields of asiatic acid and asiaticoside. On the other hand, the outcome was not heavily reliant on the pressure of the extraction process because there was little increment in the yield of asiaticoside (from 4.6 to 8.1 mg/g) or asiatic acid (from 2.4 to 3.4 mg/g) on increasing the pressure from 10 to 40 MPa. Regarding the effect of pressure on the extraction, there were not many changes toward the polarity of the subcritical water. Hence, subcritical water pressure lacks influence on the extraction yield.
