<p>Regardless of the benefits, the interaction between the sample and oxygen during MAE operated at a very high temperature may cause a destructive effect on the desired bioactive compounds, especially if they are oxygen- and heat-sensitive [

 <xref rid="B74-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Hence, vacuum microwave-assisted extraction (VMAE) has been developed as an option to acquire that type of bioactive compounds [
 <xref rid="B39-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. It is a method in which the boiling temperature of an extraction solvent is lowered, consequently reducing the extraction temperature. The pressure is also reduced so that less oxygen is present for the unfavorable process of oxidation. Fresh and dried leaves of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> were treated with VMAE to extract triterpene saponins and phenolics at various pressures. It was found that the fresh leaves of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> contained the maximum triterpene saponins when VMAE was performed at 60 kPa, while the maximum TPC was obtained when extraction was carried out in atmospheric conditions. On the other hand, the dried leaves contained the highest triterpene saponins and TPC when they were extracted at atmospheric pressure: the temperature was higher, which caused greater diffusivity of bioactive compounds and resulted in a more elevated amount of triterpene saponins and TPC. Otherwise, at 20 kPa, the temperature of extraction was reduced (~40 Â°C), thus minimizing diffusion of the bioactive compounds [
