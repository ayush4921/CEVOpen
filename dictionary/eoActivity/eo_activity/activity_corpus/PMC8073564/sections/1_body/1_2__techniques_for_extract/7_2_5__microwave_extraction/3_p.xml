 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> by MAE that using 90% methanol for 20 min was the optimal condition to extract the highest yield. In another study by Desai et al. [
 <xref rid="B38-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], the extracts yielded by the MAE method had a 26% increase of TPC and 8% increase of saponin content compared to the traditional solvent extraction. However, the extracts did not exhibit anti-inflammatory activity. A study by Sen et al. [
 <xref rid="B54-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] using MAE found that it was a much better method for obtaining TPC and triterpenoids than Soxhlet: the extraction time was only 6 min compared to 36 h by Soxhlet, but also the microwave produced 200 times less carbon load. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00457-f006">Figure 6</xref> shows the difference in compound concentrations obtained using MAE and Soxhlet extraction. Increasing the microwave power from 170 to 425 W also increased the TPC from 20 to 50%, due to the rapid transfer of electromagnetic energy in the microwave, thus simultaneously heating the plant sample. This situation causes internal stress inside the plant and eventually bursts the cell wall, releasing its contents [
