<p>Subcritical water extraction is a method that modifies the physical properties of water under high pressure and increases the temperature above its boiling point (up to 374 Â°C) to maintain the water in its liquid state, thus improving it as an extraction solvent. Subcritical water extraction is an efficient, harmless, and eco-friendly method for extracting polar compounds from samples, which is an excellent substitute for conventional organic solvent extraction methods. Furthermore, this method requires less extraction time and solvent, but acquires a higher quality of extracts [
