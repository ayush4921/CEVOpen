<p>It was found that 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> has cytotoxic activity from 500 µg/mL to above 1000 µg/mL, suggesting that it is weakly or insignificantly cytotoxic [
 <xref rid="B103-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> was discovered to have an LD50 of more than 1000 µg/mL at three different concentrations of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> (100, 500, and 1000 µg/mL) against 28.7 µg/mL potassium dichromate [
 <xref rid="B106-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. All concentrations posed an insignificant toxicity level after 24 h of exposure. The mortality rate of brine shrimp was 3.33% at a concentration of 10 µg/mL, 20.00% at 100 µg/mL, and 40.00% at 1000 µg/mL of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> ethanolic extract, after 24 h of exposure [
 <xref rid="B107-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. Calculation of LD50 was 1926 µg/mL against the standard drug, etoposide. The maximum toxic concentration was 60,822 µg/mL, and the minimum limit of toxic concentration was 606 µg/mL, showing a lower cytotoxicity level of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> [
 <xref rid="B103-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Selvi et al. [
 <xref rid="B108-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>] reported an LD50 for aqueous and chloroform extracts of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> of 840 and 765 µg/mL, respectively, also showing low toxicity of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic>. The type of solvent used to obtain extracts influenced the LD50 results because different solvents have different extraction potential for toxicity screening. Furthermore, some solvents are better than others for extracting bioactive compounds from plants that might be toxic [
 <xref rid="B103-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Preparation of stock solutions and dilution factors of sample extracts can also affect the concentrations of sample solutions, thus directly influencing the toxicity results for sample extracts during biological screening [
