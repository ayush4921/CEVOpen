<p>Toxicity is the level of adverse health effects on living organisms from the interaction between living cells and selective toxicants. A toxicity test is crucial to ensure the safety and efficacy of plant extracts. This can be done using the brine shrimp lethality assay (BSLA) using different concentrations of crude plant extracts [

 <xref rid="B104-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. Brine shrimp (
 <italic>Artemia salina</italic>) have been used in over 90% of studies using 
 <italic>Artemia</italic> as a test organism since it is simple, inexpensive, rapid, convenient, and requires a small amount of test material. LD50 is the concentration required to obtain the death of 50% of the test population with the BSLA. An extract is considered toxic if the LD50 is less than 1000 µg/mL, weakly toxic if 500 to 1000 µg/mL, and non-toxic if the LD50 is more than 1000 µg/mL [
