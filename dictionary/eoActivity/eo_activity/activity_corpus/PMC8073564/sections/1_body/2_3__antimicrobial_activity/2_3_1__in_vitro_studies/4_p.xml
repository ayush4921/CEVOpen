<p>Purkait et al. [
 <xref rid="B88-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] studied the efficacy of aqueous, methanol, and chloroform extracts of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> against the fish pathogenic bacteria 
 <italic>Aeromonas hydrophila</italic> and 
 <italic>Edwardsiella tarda</italic> using agar disc diffusion, agar overlay well diffusion, and broth dilution assays. All types of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> extract failed to inhibit 
 <italic>A. hydrophila</italic>. On the other hand, 
 <italic>E. tarda</italic> was inhibited by chloroform extract (11.25 ± 0.35 mm) using the agar disc diffusion assay. In the agar overlay well diffusion assay, 50 μL of chloroform and methanol extracts of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> inhibited 
 <italic>E. tarda</italic> (30.50 ± 6.40 and 7.50 ± 0.70 mm, respectively) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00457-f008">Figure 8</xref>). The crude chloroform extract of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> using agar overlay well-diffusion assay produced the largest zone of inhibition (30.50 ± 6.40 mm), which was comparable to those of the chloramphenicol (40.75 ± 1.76 mm). In the broth dilution assay, increasing the concentration of crude chloroform 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> extract resulted in increased inhibition of 
 <italic>E. tarda</italic> growth (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00457-f009">Figure 9</xref>). It was concluded that the chloroform extract of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> is the most effective to control 
 <italic>E. tarda</italic> infection, especially in aquaculture.
