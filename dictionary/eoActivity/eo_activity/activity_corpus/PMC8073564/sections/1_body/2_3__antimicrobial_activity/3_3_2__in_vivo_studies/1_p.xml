<p>Although many studies have been done on the antimicrobial properties of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> in vitro, they are not a complete test to summarize the antimicrobial activity and analogize the way the extract will act in vivo. There are other circumstances such as first-pass metabolism, microbial defense, drug resistance, and conditions of the patientâ€™s pathology that will also influence the effectiveness of the test [

Few antimicrobial studies are done in vivo due to their complexity and expense; not only does the activity against the microbes need to be assessed, but there is also a concern regarding possible allergic reactions and mammalian cell toxicity [

 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> in animal models have focused on wound healing since the plant is famous for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity [
