<p>Mostly, extraction of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> to determine the antimicrobial activity of the extract is done by a conventional method such as maceration or Soxhlet. Still, several studies have used methods such as UAE and MAE: extracts of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> obtained using these methods also showed positive inhibition of the growth of studied bacteria. UAE of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> produced an extract that could inhibit 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (6.5 mm zone of inhibition) and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (8.5 mm) [

 <xref rid="B52-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] found that the extract from UAE was the best for inhibiting the growth of Gram-negative bacteria. At a concentration of 100 Âµg/mL, methanol extract of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> leaves obtained by UAE showed the largest zone of inhibition against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (30 mm), followed by 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> (29 mm), 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (both 28 mm) [

 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> leaves; these compounds display efficacy against Gram-negative bacteria such as 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> [
