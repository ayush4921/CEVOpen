<p>A study by Zheng et al. [
 <xref rid="B82-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] using an extract of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> obtained by the maceration method found that at 2 mg/mL, it inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> by the agar well diffusion method; the MIC against the strains tested ranged from 0.125 to 8 mg/mL. Methanol extract obtained by the maceration method showed a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity using the agar diffusion method against both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, with the zones of inhibition ranging from 9 to 29 mm and the MIC ranging from 1.25 to &gt;10 mg/mL [

 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> using methanol produced an extract that was unable to inhibit 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> [
