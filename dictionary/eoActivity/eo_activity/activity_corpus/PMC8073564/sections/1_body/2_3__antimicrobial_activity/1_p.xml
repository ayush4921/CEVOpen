<p>Plant-based antimicrobials are often studied and used in medicine as they have fewer side effects compared to synthetic antimicrobials. 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> is one of the plants that have antimicrobial activity against many types of bacteria and fungi since the triterpenoids in 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> can be regarded as phytoanticipins due to their selective cytotoxicity and protective role in preventing infections from a pathogen [

 <xref rid="B76-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Flavonoids and tannins are known for their antimicrobial activity [

 <italic>C. asiatica</italic>, the extracts obtained from selected extraction methods were further analyzed for their antimicrobial properties. Many studies have been done on the activity of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> extracts against pathogens. Still, they are hard to compare depending on the type of extraction method, solvents, strains of microbes, and antimicrobial test methods used [
