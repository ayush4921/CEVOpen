<p>In general, the methanolic extract of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> shows a better inhibitory effect than acetone, chloroform, and water extracts [

 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> is a good source of an antimicrobial agent against a wide range of microbes. Details of the effectiveness of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> extracts obtained by several different extraction methods toward various types of microbes are shown in
