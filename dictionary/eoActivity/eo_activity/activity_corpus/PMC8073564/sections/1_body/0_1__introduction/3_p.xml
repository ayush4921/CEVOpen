<p>Different studies published worldwide have reported that up to seventy compounds have been extracted from 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> [
 <xref rid="B5-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The most abundant bioactive compounds found in 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> are represented by asiaticoside, madecassoside, asiatic, and madecassic acid from the triterpene class [
 <xref rid="B5-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Triterpenes are used in cosmeceuticals mainly for wound-healing, anti-wrinkle, and anti-cellulite effects since they increase the synthesis of collagen and improve the production of fibronectin in human skin fibroblasts [
 <xref rid="B6-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Specifically, asiaticoside increases the hydroxyproline content and tensile strength in wound tissue, raises the collagen Type I and III content, expedites the wound-healing process, and induces glycosaminoglycan synthesis [
 <xref rid="B6-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Madecassoside can also stimulate the production of collagen Type III [
 <xref rid="B6-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Other compounds from the saponins group that can be found in a smaller amount in 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> are brahmoside, centelloside, glycosides, and alkaloids [
 <xref rid="B5-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Flavonoids such as kaempferol, quercetin, rutin, catechin, naringin, and apigenin that contribute to the total phenolic content can also be found in 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> [
 <xref rid="B14-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].
