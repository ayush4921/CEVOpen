<p>The typical stages of separating bioactive compounds from plant materials are sample preparation, extraction, and purification. It is crucial to select the appropriate extraction method since more than 60% of the total time is used for the sample preparation stage [
 <xref rid="B33-antibiotics-10-00457" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Moreover, the right choice of extraction method can improve the extractâ€™s quality and prevent loss of the target compounds. Since extraction is the crucial stage in obtaining the desired compounds from 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic>, here we review the methods used for the extraction of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic>. This review covers the utilization of both simple technologies and advanced extraction techniques that have been reported to get the best yield from the herb, and the in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity of the extracts from the selected extraction methods. Finally, the safety and toxicology of the 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> extract are further discussed for a better understanding.
