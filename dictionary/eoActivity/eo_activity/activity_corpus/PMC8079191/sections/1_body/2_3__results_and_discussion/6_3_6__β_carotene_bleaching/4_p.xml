<p>In acetone extract and fractions, we observed that the inhibition activity is dispersed as follows: 
 <bold>SA5</bold> &gt; 
 <bold>SA10</bold> &gt; 
 <bold>FA</bold> &gt; 
 <bold>SA2</bold> &gt; 
 <bold>SA1</bold> &gt; 
 <bold>SA4</bold>. The first group of fractions composed of 
 <bold>SA5</bold> and 
 <bold>SA10</bold> had a much higher activity than 
 <bold>FA</bold> with IC
 <sub>50</sub> remarkably close to 
 <bold>BHA</bold> (
 <xref rid="tab7" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>). The second group composed of 
 <bold>SA2</bold>, 
 <bold>SA1</bold>, and 
 <bold>SA4</bold> exhibited weaker antioxidant activities than 
 <bold>FA</bold>.
