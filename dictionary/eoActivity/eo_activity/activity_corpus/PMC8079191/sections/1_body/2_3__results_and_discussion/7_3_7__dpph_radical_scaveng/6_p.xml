 <bold>SH7</bold> antioxidant activity could be explained by its phytochemical analysis due to the presence of terpenes, steroids, polyphenols, and flavonoids in the fraction. Furthermore, GC-MS analysis gave diene functional groups and unsaturated fatty acids, which are known by their antioxidant activity. Palmitic acid is reported to have an antioxidant effect [
