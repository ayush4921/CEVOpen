<p>The presence of other compounds was less than 6.24%, but it should be noted that the majority of the compounds extracted had similar structures. It was also observed that the rest of the compounds extracted differed in the literature. This can be explained by spontaneous chemical reactions occurring as a result of physical conditions (i.e., light and temperature) without any experimental intervention.</p>
