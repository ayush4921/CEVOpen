<p>The 
 <bold>FA</bold> contained a mixture of several compounds. Gallic acid is the major compound in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. It is also clearly visible in the 
 <bold>SA1</bold>, 
 <bold>SA2</bold>, and 
 <bold>SA3</bold> fractions. Our results are in agreement with those reported by Mechraoui et al. [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Except the kaempferol, all compounds found in the mother extract disappeared in the separated fractions. It should be noted that the separation was successful since, at the end, each fraction contained only one (
 <bold>SA1</bold>, 
 <bold>SA4</bold>), two (
 <bold>SA3</bold>, 
 <bold>SA7</bold>), or three (
 <bold>SA2</bold>, 
 <bold>SA11</bold>) compounds. Due to technical problems, some fractions (
 <bold>SA5</bold>, 
 <bold>SA6</bold>, and 
 <bold>SA8</bold>) could not be analyzed and identified.
