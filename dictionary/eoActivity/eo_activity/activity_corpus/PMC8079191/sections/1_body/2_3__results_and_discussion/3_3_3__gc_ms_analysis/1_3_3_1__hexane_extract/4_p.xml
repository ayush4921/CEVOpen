<p>In Morocco, Gharby et al. [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] reported 58.5% of oleic acid after extraction of esterified hexane extract, while Khodami et al. [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] showed that hexane extract of 
 <italic>NS</italic> was mainly unsaturated fatty acids such as palmitic, linoleic, and oleic acids. Piras et al. [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] reported that Turkish 
 <italic>NS</italic> contained 55% unsaturated fatty acids. Unidentified components in the esterified hexane extract represented only 13%. Those might be dependent on the esterification/methylation process. Ekowati et al. [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and De Oliveira and Khater [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] reported many other compounds not found in our work.
