<p>The results of the HPLC analysis are presented in chromatograms (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) that show the constituents of the acetone extract and its fractions, while 
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> shows the identified constituents. On the 
 <italic>Y</italic>-axis, the values of the peak's intensities are arbitrary. We can compare the intensities of the peaks on the same scheme, but we cannot compare them with the others because the collected fractions were concentrated each time by evaporation in a rotavapor. Therefore, we can only compare the position of the peaks in the chromatogram on the 
 <italic>X</italic>-axis.
