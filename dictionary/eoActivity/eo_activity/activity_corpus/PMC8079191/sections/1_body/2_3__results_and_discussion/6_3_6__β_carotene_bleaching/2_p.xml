<p>The activity of fractions from the hexane extract was dispersed as follows: 
 <bold>SH4</bold> &gt; 
 <bold>SH1</bold> &gt; 
 <bold>SH7</bold> &gt; 
 <bold>FH</bold>. 
 <bold>SH4</bold> had the highest activity and resemblance to the reference 
 <bold>BHA</bold> (
 <xref rid="tab7" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>), likely due to the presence of steroids and terpenes. Although 
 <bold>SH1</bold> and 
 <bold>SH7</bold> also contained steroids and flavonoids, they had a weak activity compared to 
 <bold>SH4</bold>. This can be attributed to the presence of other families of chemical compounds, which inhibit the apparent activity.
