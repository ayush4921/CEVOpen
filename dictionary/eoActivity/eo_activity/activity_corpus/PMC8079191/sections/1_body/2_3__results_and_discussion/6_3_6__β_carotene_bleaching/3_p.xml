<p>The characterization by GC-MS showed the existence of many antioxidant components [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], which have similar structure to 
 <bold>BHA</bold>. In addition, derived terpenes were identified, such as 2.4-decadienal and (Z) 9-Tricosene. Moreover, fatty acid analogues, like linoleic acid, 17 pentatriacontene, or 2.4-decadienal, were also found. To support this claim, 
 <bold>SH4</bold>, 
 <bold>SH1</bold>, and 
 <bold>SH7</bold> were compared to vegetal species with high antioxidant activity like sage, thyme, and curcuma [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In the extract's lipids, the present antioxidant and anticancer phytosterols were also detected [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].
