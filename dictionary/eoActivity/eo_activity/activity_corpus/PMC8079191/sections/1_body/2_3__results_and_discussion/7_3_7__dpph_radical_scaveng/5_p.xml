<p>Haroun [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] reported that 
 <italic>NS</italic> hexane extract from two different places in the same country (Malaysia) gave IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 8.17 mg/mL for 
 <italic>NS</italic> harvested in Shah Alam and IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 4.48 mg/mL for 
 <italic>NS</italic> harvested in Kentalan. In Yemen, DPPH test showed an IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 12.79 mg/mL, in Sudan it was equal to 4.48 mg/mL [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and in Ethiopia IC
 <sub>50</sub> was 8.52 mg/mL. Soulaimanifar et al. [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] reported a very high IC
 <sub>50</sub> value, 104.76 mg/mL, in Iran. In Tunisia, Ksouda et al. [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] reported that 
 <italic>NS</italic> hexane extract had IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 31 mg/mL, a very close value to our 23.25 mg/mL. The origin of the seeds and the extraction method are key factors for the quality and quantity of secondary metabolites. In Malaysia, the DPPH test on hexane extract by supercritical fluid extraction gave an IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.58 mg/mL [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].
