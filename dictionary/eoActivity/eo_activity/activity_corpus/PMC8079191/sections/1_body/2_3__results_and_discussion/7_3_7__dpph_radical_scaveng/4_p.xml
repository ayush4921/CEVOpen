<p>Considering the two antioxidant tests, 
 <italic>β</italic>-carotene, and DPPH
 <sup>●</sup>, the fractions from the acetone extract were more active than those from the hexane extract. For 
 <italic>β</italic>-carotene, the best value was found in the acetone fraction 
 <bold>SA5</bold> with IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.064 mg/mL, which is remarkably close to the BHA reference, which has a value of IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.053 mg/mL. In the case of DPPH, all the acetone fractions showed acceptable IC
 <sub>50</sub> values, particularly fractions 
 <bold>SA5</bold>, 
 <bold>SA10</bold>, and 
 <bold>SA11</bold> which had mean IC
 <sub>50</sub> values around 0.25 mg/mL. However, they are extremely far from the reference ascorbic acid (0.018 mg/mL).
