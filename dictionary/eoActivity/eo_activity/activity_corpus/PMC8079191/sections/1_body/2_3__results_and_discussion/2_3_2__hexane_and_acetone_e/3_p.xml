<p>The eight fractions generated by hexane (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) show varying yields with the highest being 
 <bold>SH1</bold> with 72.35% followed by 
 <bold>SH7</bold> (9.11%). The others give yields less than 5.12%. The yields of fractions generated by acetone extract were calculated relative to the mass of the mother extract of acetone (
 <bold>FA</bold>) introduced at the beginning. 
 <bold>SA1</bold> represents the highest yield at 62.88% followed by 
 <bold>SA11</bold> at 15.82%. The other fractions were all less than 10%.
