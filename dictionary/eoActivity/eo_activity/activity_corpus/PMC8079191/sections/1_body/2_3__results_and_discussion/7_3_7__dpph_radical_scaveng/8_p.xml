<p>The chemical structure of the fractions was identified by HPLC-DAD and the fraction's antioxidant activity was compared to commercial pure compounds. Pure commercial gallic acid IC
 <sub>50</sub> was reported as 1.50 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], apigenin IC
 <sub>50</sub> was 30.3 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL, rutin had an IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 23.7–50 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], and quercetin presented with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. These products are the essential compounds in fractions 
 <bold>SA1</bold>, 
 <bold>SA2</bold>, and 
 <bold>SA11</bold>. It is clear that fractions of a single compound and fractions with multiple compounds do not have the same antioxidant activity level. There can be a positive synergistic effect on the activity or a negative one (inhibitor effect). If we compare the activity of 
 <bold>SA1</bold> and 
 <bold>SA3</bold>, we can see that catechol in the presence of gallic acid has a negative effect on the antioxidant activity, whereas, in the case of 
 <bold>SA2</bold>, hydroquinone and apigenin had a positive effect on activity. Therefore, testing is required to be able to predict the synergistic effects.
