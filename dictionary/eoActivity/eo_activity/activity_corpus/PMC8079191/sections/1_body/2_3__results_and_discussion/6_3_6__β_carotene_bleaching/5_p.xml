<p>Singh et al. [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] reported that 
 <bold>FA</bold> was the most interesting part of 
 <italic>NS</italic> because it has the highest antioxidant activity. Mechraoui et al. [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] found that, in 
 <italic>β</italic>−carotene tests, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> from the acetone extract was 0.2444 mg/mL. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of pure gallic acid found by Lu and Khoo [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] (10.50 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL) was different from that which we found in 
 <bold>SA1</bold> containing exclusively gallic acid. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> for rutin is estimated to be 26.2 mg/mL by Yang et al. [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The only pure flavonoids like apigenin, quercetin, and naringenin gave interesting antioxidant activity [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. This result can be extrapolated to the results found for fractions 
 <bold>SA4</bold>, 
 <bold>SA5</bold>, and 
 <bold>SA10</bold> since they only contain these flavonoids.
