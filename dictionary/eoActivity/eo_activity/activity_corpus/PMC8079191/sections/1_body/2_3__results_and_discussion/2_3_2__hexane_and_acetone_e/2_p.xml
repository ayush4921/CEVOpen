 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the yield of assembled fractions in relation to their respective mother extract. The yields were calculated relative to the mass of the mother extracts 
 <bold>FH</bold> and 
 <bold>FA</bold> used at the beginning. Following this procedure, the hexane mother extract generated eight fractions, 
 <bold>SH1-8</bold>, and that for acetone fractions there were 11 fractions, 
 <bold>SA1-11</bold>.
