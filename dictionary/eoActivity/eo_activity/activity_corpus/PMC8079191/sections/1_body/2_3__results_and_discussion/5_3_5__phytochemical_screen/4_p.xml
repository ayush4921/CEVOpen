<p>The phytochemical results of the 
 <italic>NS</italic> hexane extract are similar to those reported by Javed [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], except in the absence of sterols in their hexane extract. Other phytochemical investigation [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] described close phytochemical screening to our results. Nevertheless, coumarins are reported and saponins were absent in our results.
