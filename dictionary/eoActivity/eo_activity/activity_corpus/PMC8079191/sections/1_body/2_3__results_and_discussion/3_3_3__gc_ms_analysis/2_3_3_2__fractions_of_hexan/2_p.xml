 <bold>SH5</bold>, and 
 <bold>SH7</bold> and oleic acid found in fractions 
 <bold>SH3</bold>, 
 <bold>SH6</bold>, and 
 <bold>SH8</bold>. The appearance of fatty acids in many fractions could be explained by the disturbance of compounds migrating in the column because of the abundance of fatty acids. In fact, a high quantity of fatty acids and their derivatives migrated poorly in the column chromatography. To overcome this problem, we proceeded to centrifugation and then cooled the extract to −4°C to separate the solid fat. Only 1.5% of the fatty acids were eliminated using this method.
