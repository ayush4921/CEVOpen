<p>In the successive extraction of the 
 <italic>Nigella sativa</italic> L seeds (
 <italic>NS</italic>), the yields of mother extracts (FH and FA) were calculated relative to the mass of the starting powdered seeds placed in the Soxhlet apparatus. Hot extraction is more beneficial than cold extraction because the maceration and provides significantly higher yields [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In general, the color of the mother extracts obtained is more or less deep brown. The results show that the mother hexane extract, 
 <bold>FH</bold>, is the most abundant (34.2%), while the acetone mother extract, 
 <bold>FA</bold>, only represented 2%. It can be underlined that 
 <italic>NS</italic> contains essential fatty acid compounds (about 30%). The final residue devoid of its chemical composition and probably consisting of fibers exhibits a 45.6% yield. This yield is similar to those of Khoddami et al. [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] (37.33%) and Matthaus [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] (36%.) However, Antuono et al. [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] obtained only 26% of 
 <italic>NS</italic> in Moroccan seeds. Similarly, Sun and Ho [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] obtained comparative acetone extract yields at 2.5%.
