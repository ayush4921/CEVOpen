 <xref rid="tab7" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref> presents the values of the inhibitory concentrations necessary to reduce 50% oxidation (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) by the antioxidant 
 <italic>Î²</italic>-carotene. The values are given for both hexane and acetone mother extracts, as well as their corresponding fractions, which are compared with the reference value of butylhydroxyanisole (
 <bold>BHA</bold>). At the beginning, the quantity collected from certain fractions was extremely low. Hence, we could not perform totality tests of all fractions without exhausting our stock. All hexane fractions were more active than their mother extract 
 <bold>FH</bold>; however the acetone mother extract 
 <bold>FA</bold> was more active than three of its fractions.
