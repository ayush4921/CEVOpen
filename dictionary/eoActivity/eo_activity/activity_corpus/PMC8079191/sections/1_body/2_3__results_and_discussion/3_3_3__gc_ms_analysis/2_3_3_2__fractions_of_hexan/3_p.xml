<p>In general, naturally extracted plant products are continuously transformed by oxidation or other chemicals reactions. Consequently, their percentage varies indefinitely despite good conservation. For example, olive oil retains its physicochemical characteristics for a whole year, but loses taste quality over time [

In addition, the chromatography column is slightly acidic, and the eluting solvents contain traces of transition metals, which can cause additional chemical reactions and transformations.
