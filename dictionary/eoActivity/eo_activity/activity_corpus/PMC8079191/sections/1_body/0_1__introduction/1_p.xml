<p>Artificial antioxidants such as butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) are commonly reported for their efficiency in delaying cell deterioration but are also suspected to have negative health effects like carcinogenesis and toxicity [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Therefore, replacement with natural antioxidants could reduce health risks. 
 <italic>Nigella sativa</italic> (

 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In fact,
