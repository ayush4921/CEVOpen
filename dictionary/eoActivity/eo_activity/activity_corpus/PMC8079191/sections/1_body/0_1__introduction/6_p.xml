<p>Hexane is a nonpolar solvent, which can only extract nonpolar compounds such as lipids (fatty acids). On the other hand, acetone is a polar solvent that can extract polar entities such as flavonoids and polyphenols. The use of a solvent of intermediate polarity (chloroform or ethyl acetate) that contains a mixture of the two groups of compounds is likely to inhibit separation. This study aimed to extract and separate these secondary metabolites simultaneously and evaluate their antioxidant activity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use chromatography to separate secondary metabolites of Moroccan 
 <italic>Nigella sativa</italic>. To do this, we separated the mother extract, with known antioxidant activity, and generated several fractions, which in turn pass the antioxidant tests. Only those fractions exhibiting antioxidant activity moved forward with testing.
