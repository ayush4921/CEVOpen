<p>Most previous studies explored the compounds hot- or cold-extracted with polar or nonpolar solvents as well as the essential oil [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These extracts contain a mixture of several families of chemical compounds; therefore it is highly unlikely that a single well-defined compound explains all therapeutic uses. In this work, we focus on two essential mother extracts that may contain distinct groups of secondary metabolites.
