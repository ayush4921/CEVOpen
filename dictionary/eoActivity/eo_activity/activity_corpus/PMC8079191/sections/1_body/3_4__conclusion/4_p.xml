<p>We have succeeded to identify some of the interesting fractions generated by the mother extract and specified the compounds responsible for antioxidant activities. In fact, it can be said that, for 
 <italic>Î²</italic>-carotene test, antioxidants are concentrated in hexane fractions 
 <bold>SH4</bold>, 
 <bold>SA5</bold>, and 
 <bold>SA10</bold>. For DPPH test, fractions 
 <bold>SH8</bold>, 
 <bold>SA5</bold>, 
 <bold>SA10</bold>, and 
 <bold>SA11</bold> include the active entities of 
 <italic>Nigella sativa</italic> L. Future research should explore the active fractions 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and compare their antioxidant activity in animal models before and after induction of diseases caused by oxidative stress.
