<p>This study describes the simultaneous process of extraction-separation of chemical components of 
 <italic>Nigella sativa</italic> L seeds based on the polarity of two well-chosen solvents. We have succeeded in extracting and separating two families of compounds with different physicochemical and phytochemical properties. Analysis and separation methods like GC-MS and HPLC-DAD allowed us to characterize and identify the majority of the mother extracts and separated fraction constituents. It should be noted that the Moroccan 
 <italic>Nigella sativa</italic> L is rich in linoleic acid but low on oleic or palmitic acid.
