<p>The powder was subjected to extraction using the following solvents: hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and acetone. The extractions took place over 24 hours using a Soxhlet apparatus at 40–50°C. The solvent was then evaporated on a rotavapor (BUCHI Rotavapor R-210) in vacuum rotary at 40°C. The percentage of the extract yield was calculated using the mass of the seeds powder initially placed in the Soxhlet.</p>
