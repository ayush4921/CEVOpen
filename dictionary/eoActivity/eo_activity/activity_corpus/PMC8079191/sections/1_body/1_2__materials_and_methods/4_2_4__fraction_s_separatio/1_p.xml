<p>Only two extracts were chosen for evaluation, those of hexane and acetone origin, due to the time-sensitive nature of separation by column chromatography. These two solvents were chosen because for their significant lipophilia gap; the difference of polarity would allow for simultaneous extraction and separation of compound groups with very varied physicochemical properties. In fact, hexane is a nonpolar solvent which promotes the solubility of hydrophobic compounds, while the polar solvent acetone solubilizes hydrophilic compounds.</p>
