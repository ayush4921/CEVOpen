<p>Fraction investigation was performed on GC-MS using SHIMADZU instrument (GC-MS-QP2010) under computer control at 70 eV. About 1 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of every fraction was injected into the (GC) column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 
 <italic>μ</italic>m) under a flow rate of helium gas equal to 1.4 mL/min. Scanning continued for 28 min and the ionization temperature was maintained at 200°C. The identification and quantification of the compounds were determined by comparing retention indices and spectral mass fragments with computer library NIST147 LIB [
