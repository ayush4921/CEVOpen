<p>This method was developed by Sun and Ho [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and is based on the measure of absorbance at 470 nm due to the decomposition of linoleic acid. An emulsion of 
 <italic>β</italic>−carotene-linoleic acid is prepared with Tween20 and hydrogen peroxide. 2 mg 
 <italic>β</italic>-carotene is dissolved in 10 mL chloroform. 1 mL of this solution is added to 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>L linoleic acid and 200 mg Tween 40. The chloroform is evaporated at 40°C under vacuum using a rotary evaporator and the residue is taken up to 100 mL by aerated distillated water with vigorous agitation. 4 mL of the emulsion is placed in a series of tubes containing 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>L samples of the fractions at different concentrations. The tubes are well shaken, and the absorbance is read at once at 470 nm. The tubes are placed at 50°C for 120 minutes with a control, which contained only the emulsion and methanol. Absorbance was recorded and the inhibition percentage was expressed using equation (
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="EEq1">1</xref>). IC
 <sub>50</sub> is the 50% inhibition concentration determined graphically on the % I = 
 <italic>f</italic> (
 <italic>C</italic>) curve by the extrapolation on the 
 <italic>X</italic>-axis for the value of 
 <italic>Y</italic> = 50% inhibition. IC
 <sub>50</sub> was determined for the extracts and fractions. For 
 <italic>β</italic>-carotene, the inhibition percentage was calculated according to the following equation:
