<p>Extracts were fractioned by silica gel column chromatography using 20% hexane/80% dichloromethane eluent system for hexane extract and 50% cyclohexane/50% dichloromethane eluent system for acetone extract. The dimensions of column chromatography were 6.5 cm × 47 cm and the porosity of the silica gel was 60A°(63–200
