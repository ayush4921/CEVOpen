<p>DPPH radical activity was carried out by the Gramza-Michalowska method [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. DPPH is a stable radical, which has a free electron on the nitrogen atom. In the presence of antioxidant DPPH, the color changes from violet to yellow [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In this test, various concentrations of fractions were added to the methanol solution of DPPH radicals (0.004% m/v). The samples were incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature and the absorbance was recorded at 517 nm against a blank solution. The percent inhibition was calculated using equation (
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="EEq2">2</xref>). The inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) is determined as the concentration that inhibit 50% of DPPH (I% = 50). The inhibition percentage is calculated using the formula below:
