<p>The identification of phenolic compounds in the acetone extract fractions was carried out on an analytical HPLC using Waters e2695 and diode array detector. Chromatographic separation was performed through a C18 column (5 
 <italic>μ</italic>m, 250 × 4.6 mm). The solvents composition and the gradient elution process followed Mechraoui et al. [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] with some modifications. The elution was performed by a binary gradient system (A: water/acetic acid (2%v/v) and B: acetonitrile, pH = 2.6). The gradient process was 0–5 min: 95% A and 5% B, then 25–30 min: 65% A and 35% B, 35–40 min: 30% A and 70% B; and 40–45 min: 95% A and 5% B. A flow rate of 0.9 mL/min was used and 30 
 <italic>μ</italic>L fraction samples were injected after being passed through a 0.45 
 <italic>μ</italic>m filter. The UV detection was between 280 and 360 nm [
