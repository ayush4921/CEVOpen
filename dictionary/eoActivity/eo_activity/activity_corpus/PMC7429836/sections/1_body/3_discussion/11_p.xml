<p id="Par43">It was found that the concentration of all heavy metals in soil samples and fertilizers studied was less than the USEPA limits of contamination. With this point of view, there were significant differences in morphological and phytochemical properties of 
 <italic>E. purpurea</italic> with respect to slow release and chemical N fertilizers containing different dosages of NO

 <sup>−</sup>. All morphological and phytochemical properties were higher in the presence of slow release fertilizer than urea chemical fertilizer. It may be due to the polymeric structure of slow release fertilizer that control the N release during the time. Increasing of morphological and phytochemical properties, caffeic acid derivations and anti-radical scavenging activities were observed by increasing of NO

With regard to future growth conditions of the plant, it is important to make operational additional research projects for medicinal plants and flowers grown under greenhouse conditions, with the objective of building further confidence in the advantages of the plant cultivation and importance of NO
