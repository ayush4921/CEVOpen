<p>Thyme has been extensively studied for its antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. Currently, new advances and techniques in food technology have facilitated efficient identification, processing and extraction of bioactive compounds from herbs and spices in order to include them in functional foods and nutritional supplements. The strategy to produce bioactive compounds with decreased negative organoleptic characteristics and enhanced shelf life will increase overall applications in foods and will subsequently increase spice consumption and, as a consequence, have a positive impact on human health.</p>
