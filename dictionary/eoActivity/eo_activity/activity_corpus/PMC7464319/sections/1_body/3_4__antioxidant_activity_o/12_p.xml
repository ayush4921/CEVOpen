<p>In a study that compared thymol with other terpenes, such as limonene, menthone, linalool, caryophyllene, camphor, caryophyllene, menthol and pulegone, Salgado-Garciglia et al. [
 <xref rid="B52-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] reported that thymol showed the highest antioxidant capacity in three different antioxidant methods in vitro (ferric reducing antioxidant power, DPPH and 2,2â€²-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)). However, it has also been found in vitro that thymol may exert prooxidant activities, depending on the concentrations tested. This behavior of thyme was studied in intestinal Caco-2 cells by Llana-Ruiz-Cabello et al. [
