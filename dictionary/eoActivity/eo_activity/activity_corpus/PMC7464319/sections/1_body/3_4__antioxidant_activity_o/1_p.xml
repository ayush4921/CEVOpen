<p>In the Labiatae family, thymol is always accompanied by its carvacrol isomer, and both are constituents of the most studied thyme essential oil in terms of its antioxidant activity. Yanishlieva et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] compared the effectiveness of the two components, concluding that during the oxidation of lipids at room temperature, thymol is a better antioxidant than carvacrol, which may be due to the different position of the phenolic group in thymol with respect to that in carvacrol. As previously stated, the chemical composition of essential oils dictates their activity. Tepe et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] analyzed the antioxidant behavior of two varieties of 
 <italic>Thymus sipyleus</italic>, and they reported different constituents in their essential oil since, in one of them, mostly alcohols such as borneol (11.2%) were identified, while the other variety was characterized by the presence of carvacrol (58.1%) and thymol (20.5%). The authors concluded that phenolic oils were more effective in all tests performed.
