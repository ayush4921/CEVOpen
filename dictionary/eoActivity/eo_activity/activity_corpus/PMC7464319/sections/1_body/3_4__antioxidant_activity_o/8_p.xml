<p>The antioxidant effect is due to the fact that thyme EO contains at least 60 bioactive compounds with powerful antioxidant properties. The main phenolic compounds are carvacrol (3.5%), thymol (68.1%), ρ-cimeno monoterpene hydrocarbons (11.2%) and γ-terpinen (4.8%) [

Since poly(phenolic) compounds (as we have indicated on numerous occasions) exhibit redox activity and can act as hydrogen donors, as reducing agents, they also have the ability to chelate metals.
