<p>Several studies have reported that thyme is a source rich in bioactive compounds. Among the phenolic components of thyme oil are thymol and carvacrol, the latter of which is an isomer of the former. Thymol provides thyme oil with its olfactory peculiarities. Depending on the place of origin and the species of thyme, this oil offers percentages of phenolic content that range from 40 to 80 percent of thymol and up to 55 percent of carvacrol.</p>
