They are considered to be GRAS (generally recognized as safe), which makes consumers and regulatory agencies regard them as more appropriate for use in food than artificial compounds. Examples of these synthetic preservatives are butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), which have been used for years in the food industry. However, there is abundant information that indicates that these compounds are potentially carcinogenic, which has generated a growing interest in alternative products that protect against oxidation but are more natural [
