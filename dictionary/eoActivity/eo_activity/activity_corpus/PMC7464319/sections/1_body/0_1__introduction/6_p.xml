<p>There are several important classes of thyme, such as 
 <italic>Thyme vulgaris</italic>, also called common thyme, which belongs to the Lamiaceae family, and it is native to Mediterranean countries in Europe. In addition, 
 <italic>Thymus zygis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>gracilis</italic> grows in southern Spain and northern Africa, although it is mainly represented in Spanish regions, such as east of Andalucia, Albacete and Murcia, and is widely used as a condiment. It is a woody-based herb with aromatic pink flowers and green leaves. This spice is the most commercialized in Spain, where it is distilled to extract its essential oil and also exploited as the “thyme leaf” to obtain natural additives for the food industry. It is highly valuable as a flavoring agent with a spicy taste and commonly added to rabbit, boar and lamb meats. In traditional medicine, thyme has been used as a sedative, a carminative, an additive for baths or an infusion for the treatment of skin diseases [
