<p>Material plants, such as herbs of the Labiatae family, have been some of the most studied for their preservative properties [
 <xref rid="B10-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Together with their antimicrobial and antioxidant activity, natural extracts have other applications, such as anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, spasmolytic and sedative purposes. Natural extracts often owe their biological activity to the synergism between their various compounds since their separate activities are much lower than their combined activity. The toxicity of extracts is considered to be lower when all their components are as found than when they are purified, which is a phenomenon called buffering. As indicated above, food companies are currently showing an increasing interest in the incorporation of natural antioxidants and antimicrobials into food in response to the growing demand by consumers for safer and more natural foods and their rejection of the incorporation of synthetic antioxidants, which are being reassessed for the possible toxicity and carcinogenicity of the components that are formed during their degradation.
