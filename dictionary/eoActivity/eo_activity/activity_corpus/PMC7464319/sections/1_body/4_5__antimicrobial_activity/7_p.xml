<p>Other authors have shown the effectiveness of thyme on 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Both the EO obtained from 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> and that originating from 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> exert a strong action on this microorganism, which is observed in a wide range of temperatures [
 <xref rid="B69-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. For example, Burt et al. [
 <xref rid="B70-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] analyzed the effect of EOs of thyme and oregano and their four major components (thymol, carvacrol, ρ-cimeno and γ-terpinene) on 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, and they proved that thymol and carvacrol have clear bactericidal activity, reporting that they were similarly effective against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. The antimicrobial activity of the EO depends on these two components, which have an additive effect and are not influenced, in this case, by the other major constituents of oil, namely, the precursors ρ-cimeno and γ-terpinene, which apparently do not act against this bacterium. The absence of synergism between carvacrol and ρ-cimeno contrasts with that expressed by other authors [
 <xref rid="B71-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. This could be due to the physiological differences between the bacteria used in each of the studies since the structure of the cell wall of 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and other Gram-negative bacteria can inhibit the action of ρ-cimeno. As in previous studies, it was also demonstrated that thymol destroys the integrity and affects the electrical potential of the plasma membrane of the bacterial cell of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, which finally leads to cell lysis [
