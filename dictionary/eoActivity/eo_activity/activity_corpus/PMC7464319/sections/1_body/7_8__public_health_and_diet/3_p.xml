<p>Before the application of thyme as a natural extract, several factors must be taken into account, such as the nature of the extracts, fruiting stage, mode of extraction, the concentration of active extract components and the possible synergistic effect between thyme and other components. Thyme extract can be applied as a complementary food preservative in food systems such as milk products, dressings, meat and oils and for the enhancement of functional foods. In addition, other considerations regarding thyme are important and warrant its inclusion in the food industry, such as its non-toxicity, availability and low cost.</p>
