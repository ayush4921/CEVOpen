<p>In general, recommendations for the intake of food for healthy eating do not yet include suggested amounts of spices and herbs. Therefore, the recommended intake of spices and herbs should be considered for incorporation into guides for healthy eating in different countries. In addition to the health effects, the use of this plant in foods can be used to totally or partially replace other less desirable ingredients, such as synthetic additives, sugar or salt. The addition of these herbs and spices may be a strategy to stabilize stir-fry dishes, dressings and marinades, casseroles, curries, soups and Mediterranean-style cooking.</p>
