<p>The European Commission has accepted different EO components as flavoring in food, such as thymol, eugenol, carvacrol, citral, vanillin, limonene, linalool, carvone and cinnamaldehyde, because they do not present a risk to consumer health. The FDA (United States Food and Drug Administration) classifies these substances as GRAS (generally recognized as safe). Included in this category (essential oils classified as GRAS by FDA) are thyme, clove, cinnamon, oregano, mustard, nutmeg and basil. In addition, in the USA, before an EO can be added to foods, there are regulatory limitations on the accepted daily intake; therefore, before adding an EO, a daily intake survey should be available for evaluation by FDA.</p>
