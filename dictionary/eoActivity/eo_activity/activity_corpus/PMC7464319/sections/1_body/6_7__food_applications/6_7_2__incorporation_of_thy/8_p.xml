<p>Sokmen et al. [
 <xref rid="B82-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] demonstrated the inhibitory effect of 
 <italic>Thymus spathulifolius</italic> essential oil on 15 species of molds and yeasts, and 9 of the 15 were inhibited. These results coincide with those shown by Lambert et al. [
 <xref rid="B69-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], Burt [
 <xref rid="B16-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and Holley and Patel [
 <xref rid="B124-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. For these authors, the combination of an MA and thyme EO resulted in an increase in the shelf life of 9 days as a result of the antimicrobial properties of thyme EO. Similarly, Sing et al. [
 <xref rid="B137-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>] showed that thyme essential oil at a level of 0.5% and 1%, but not at 0.1%, had an antimicrobial effect against 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> in pork sausages. Ozcan et al. [
 <xref rid="B138-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>] reported that thyme EO at a level of 0.2% did not show antibacterial effects against 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> O157:H7, while at a concentration of 0.2%, it showed higher antimicrobial activity. In addition, Sagdic et al. [
 <xref rid="B139-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>] showed that thyme EO at concentrations of 0.5%, 1%, 1.5% and 2% in a nutrient broth presented a bactericidal effect against 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> O157:H7 that was dependent on the dose.
