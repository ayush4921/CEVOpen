<p>Moreover, GÃ³mez-Estaca et al. [
 <xref rid="B173-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>] studied the effects of different EOs (including thyme) against 18 bacterial strains in fish muscle extract and concluded that clove oil was the best antimicrobial; the second best was rosemary, followed by thyme and lavender oils. These essential oils were able to inhibit

 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>; however, in accord with these results, Huang et al. [
 <xref rid="B174-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>] showed that thyme EO was not able to inhibit 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp.
