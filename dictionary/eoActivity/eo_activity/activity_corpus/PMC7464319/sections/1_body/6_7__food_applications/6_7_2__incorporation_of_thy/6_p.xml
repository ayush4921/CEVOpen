<p>Another form of thyme application is the use of its by-products, such as distilled thyme leaves. These by-products are generated because the thyme essential oil industry generates an excess of waste (distilled thyme leaves) after the distillation of the leaves for the extraction of EO. The effect of supplementation on animal diets with thyme by-products on meat quality was studied by Nieto et al. [
 <xref rid="B126-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>], who investigated the effect of the inclusion of distilled thyme leaves in the diet of pregnant sheep and their effect on the final meat quality of lamb, which was studied during the storage of meat in a MA (modified atmosphere). A total of 36 sheep were randomly divided into three homogeneous groups. One group was fed a basal diet. The diet of the other two groups was modified by replacing 10% and 20% of the basal diet with pellets formed of 50% barley and 50% distilled thyme leaves. In general, the diet supplemented with distilled thyme leaves inhibited lipid oxidation, reducing the content of psychrotrophs and secondary oxidation products (TBARS), while the degree of redness was significantly greater after 7 and 14 days of storage. According to these authors, thyme by-products could be used as a source of natural antioxidants and antimicrobials in sheep feed.
