<p>To investigate sensory acceptability, Navarro-Segura et al. [
 <xref rid="B176-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">176</xref>] studied the inclusion of nanoencapsulated essential oils into cyclodextrin films, and these authors concluded that the use of both strategies (nanoencapsulation and the film) improved the sensory acceptability and decreased microbiological counts and trimethylamine, so the shelf life was extended by 4 days. These authors reported an improvement in the sensory acceptability of seabream stored on ice and packaged with films (containing nanoencapsulated essential oils with cyclodextrin). The lower microbiological counts (Enterobacteriaceae, mesophilic bacteria and psychrophilic bacteria) and trimethylamine allowed the shelf life of the fish to be extended by 4 days.
