<p>Other studies have investigated whether the addition of natural extract containing phenolic compounds or inclusion of rosemary or thyme leaves in the diet of pregnant ewes has an influence on the oxidative stability and sensory properties of raw and cooked lamb, poultry, as well as pork and chicken meat [

In one of these studies, the authors reported that the inclusion of thyme in the diet of ewes favored a high antioxidant capacity in samples of lamb meat. Cooked lamb meat supplemented with thyme leaves was observed to have lower levels of TBARS and hexanal, while sensory analysis determined a decrease in smell and rancid taste compared with control samples.
