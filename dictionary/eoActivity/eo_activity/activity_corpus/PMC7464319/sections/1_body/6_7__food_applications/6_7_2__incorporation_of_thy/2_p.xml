<p>To explore the effects of the inclusion of thyme in the animal diet, a study with distilled thyme leaf was conducted by Mo√±ino et al. [
 <xref rid="B116-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>], who investigated whether the introduction of the distilled thyme leaves (10 and 20%) to the feed of pregnant sheep could lead to the transfer of phenolic compounds to lamb meat by studying the lipid stability of the meat (by using the FRAP, ABTS and DPPH methods) and the antioxidant properties of the thyme leaves. In the muscle deltoideus of lambs from mothers fed distilled thyme leaves, the authors found a higher concentration of ferulic acid, rosmarinic acid, carnosic acid, coumaric acid and carnosol than in control samples. However, this significant increase in phenolic compounds did not mean an improvement in their lipid stability. In contrast, it has been shown in numerous studies that feeding with natural products is a strategy to introduce natural antioxidants into phospholipid membranes, where they can inhibit oxidative mechanisms; for example, the incorporation of thyme (
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic>) into diet rats contributed to the maintenance of an excellent antioxidant capacity in these animals [
