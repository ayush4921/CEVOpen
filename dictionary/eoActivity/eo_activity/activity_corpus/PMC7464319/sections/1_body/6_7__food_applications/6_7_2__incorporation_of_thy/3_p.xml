<p>As previously stated, the beneficial effects of the addition of thyme, both its extract and its essential oil, have been studied in several types of meat: veal [

In this study, it was determined that feeding with thyme reduced the oxidation of egg yolk. Another study was conducted by Tanabe et al. [
 <xref rid="B111-plants-09-00961" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>], who reported the effective prevention of lipid oxidation when a liquid extract of thyme was incorporated into homogenized samples of swine meat at levels ranging from 0.5% to 2.5%
