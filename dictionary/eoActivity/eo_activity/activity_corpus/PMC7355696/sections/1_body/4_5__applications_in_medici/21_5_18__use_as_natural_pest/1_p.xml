<p>In Spain, 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> has been popularly used on chicken farms to prevent lice and frequent scratching of animals, which intensified its planting on farms [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-25-02898" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Moreover, a plant extract of 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> was tested against fourth instar larvae of the mosquito 
 <italic>Culex pipiens</italic>. The obtained results indicated a sensitivity of 
 <italic>C. pipiens</italic> larvae that was even higher when the exposure time of larvae to the insecticide is extended. The greatest mortality rate (94%) was achieved with 900 mg/L and a 72 h exposure to 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> extract, whereas a 59% mortality rate was achieved with 900 mg/L and a 72 h exposure period. These results may provide an opportunity to develop alternatives to environmentally hazardous chemicals using some readily available, affordable plants which are mostly harmless to different living organisms [

 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> has a remarkable toxicity on the snails of both 
 <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> and 
 <italic>S. haematobium</italic> species [

 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> leaf extract and rizosphere soil extract significantly influence the seed germination and seedling growth of 
 <italic>Sinapis arvensis</italic> and 
 <italic>Latuca sativa</italic> in laboratory conditions. However, the allelopatic effects depend on target species. These extracts can be used as an important source of natural herbicides to control weeds in crop fields [
