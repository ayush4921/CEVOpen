<p>One study evaluated the hypocholesterolemic and hypotriglyceridemic activities of four 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> herb extracts (petroleum ether, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and methanol) using Triton WR-1339-induced hyperlipidemia in mice. Extracts were applied using 0.1 and 0.25 LD
 <sub>50</sub> concentrations. After 7 h and 24 h of treatment, the intragastric administration of all extracts caused a significant decrease of plasma total cholesterol; LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels were also significantly lowered by all extracts. Additionally, more polar extracts (methanol and ethyl acetate) showed a significant ameliorative action on elevated atherogenic index (AI) and LDL/HDL-C ratios [
