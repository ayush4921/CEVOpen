<p>As evident from the above mentioned studies, Pine tree and is natural derivatives have proven to be therapeutic and preventative agents for periodontal infections in various 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies and can prove to be a promising product for dental infections in humans too. Pine tar oil a naturally derived product has gained interest for its edible, anti-septic, abundant property. It's easy in preparation and traditional medicinal practice has increased the research focus as a potential candidate for pharmaceutical purpose and periodontal treatment agents. Any small molecule or a plant based product to be used as a drug has to undergo a rigorous clinical testing procedure, to be proclaimed as a medication. Pine tar with attenuated phenol concentration can be used as a potential anti-microbial agent against periodontal pathogens considering its anti-bacterial and cytotoxic properties. Pine tar even though in usage for many years, contains no sufficient scientific study. A sustainable scientific proof in the form of 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in-vivo</italic> data is imminent for various form of pine tar to establish its anti-bacterial property.
