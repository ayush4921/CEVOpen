<p>This study demonstrated the efficiency of Pine tars as a potential antimicrobial agent. In vitro assay was conducted to determine MIC against specific pathogens by serial dilution analysis and disc diffusion method. Microbial strains which are predominantly involved in root cause of periodontitis were tested.
