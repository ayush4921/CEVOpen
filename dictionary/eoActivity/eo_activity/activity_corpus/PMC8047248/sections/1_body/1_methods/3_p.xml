 <italic>Porphyromonasgingivalis, P.intermedia, Aggregatibacteractinomycetemcomitans</italic> were cultured as per the standard protocol. The organisms were incubated with pine tar gel and incubated aerobically for 24 hours. Afterward, results were read as inhibition of bacterial growth by the pine tar. An inhibition zone of about 12–13 mm around the 75 µl well was observed in all the four species in the agar plates.
