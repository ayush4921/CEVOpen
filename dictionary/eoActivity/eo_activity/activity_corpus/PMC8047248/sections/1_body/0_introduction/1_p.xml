The increase of bacterial resistance, have pecked the scientific world to invest in alternative sources of anti-microbial agents with minimal or zero side effects. Pine tar is a potent anti-septic agent and also reported to have anti-microbial properties. It is extracted from pine wood carbonization after distillation by extreme heat. Also, pine tar has been in traditional medicine practice for more than 2000 years in the treatment of skin ailment. In addition, Pin tar has been reported for its anti-pyretic, anti-inflammatory, anti-fungal, antipruritic, astringent, keratoplastic, cytostatic, antibacterial, and anti-microbial effect. Its chemical composition is extremely complex, constituting of more than thousand single molecules, primarily aromatic hydrocarbons, tar acids and tar bases (
