<p>In many cases, the pine tar is used along with coal tar leading to poor results and misjudged for its mechanism of action. Pine tar is not pharmacologically standardized because of its inherent chemical complexity. Besides, the specific therapeutic activity of its components is also not known (

 <italic>in-vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in-vivo</italic> studies is an essential probe to know its mechanism of action. Against this background, the present study was aimed to evaluate the effect of Pine Tar oil on bacteria isolated from subgingivial plaque samples of patients with periodontitis.
