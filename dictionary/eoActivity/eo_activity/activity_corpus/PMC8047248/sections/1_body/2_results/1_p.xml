<p>The result of disc diffusion analysis was sufficient enough to illustrate that 75 Âµl tar oil solution produced growth inhibition of microbial strains. Serial dilution of 1/10, 1 /100, and 1/100 of tar oil were conducted against 
 <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> and 
 <italic>P. intermedia, A. actinomycetemcomitans</italic> species. The inhibitory results were similar to the original tar oil for 1.10 and 1.100 dilutions. However, no inhibition was noticed with the 1/1000 dilution
