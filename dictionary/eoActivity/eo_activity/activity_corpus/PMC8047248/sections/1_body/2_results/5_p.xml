 <bold>e</bold>ffect of tar on some bacterial isolates from sub-gingival plaque samples of study group. Each blood agar plate was divided into two halves: to the right, strains are cultured onto blood agar without tar (positive control) and to the left are the same strains cultured onto the section of the blood agar coated with tar. Note the inhibition of growth in all strains in the tar-coated sections.
