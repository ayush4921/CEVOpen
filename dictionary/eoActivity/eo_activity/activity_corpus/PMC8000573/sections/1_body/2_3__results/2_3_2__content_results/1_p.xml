<p>All studies were published over a period from 2009 to 2019 and mainly conducted in the US or Canada. Diagnosis of PTSD was made using DSM-IV or DSM-5 criteria. We included four retrospective studies [

 <xref rid="B52-life-11-00214" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Most of the studies included male subjects and two studies evaluated veterans or military personnel [

 <xref rid="B47-life-11-00214" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], THC only [

 <xref rid="B52-life-11-00214" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], medical cannabis (THC and CBD at variable percentages) [

 <xref rid="B40-life-11-00214" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] was evaluated in included studies considering different formulations (e.g., liquid oil spray, capsule), gradual titration and mean dose. The mean dose of CBD was 9 mg/d (range 1–16) for liquid oil spray formulation and 25 mg/d (range 25–100) for capsule [
 <xref rid="B47-life-11-00214" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]; THC was used at 7.5 mg in capsule formulation or oil 0.1 cc bid raising to 0.2 cc bid (0.1 cc = 2.5 mg) [
 <xref rid="B37-life-11-00214" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] while medical cannabis (THC and CBD at variable percentages) was started at 1 g/d and titrated based on clinical response to a maximum dose of 10 g/d [
 <xref rid="B48-life-11-00214" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,
 <xref rid="B49-life-11-00214" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and a mean dose of 1.2–3 g/d [

 <xref rid="B51-life-11-00214" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The start dose of nabilone was 0.5–2 mg and titrated weekly to a maximum of 3–4 mg/d (range 0.5–6 mg) [
 <xref rid="B38-life-11-00214" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39-life-11-00214" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-life-11-00214" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Only two studies used a placebo comparator group [

 <xref rid="B52-life-11-00214" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The treatment had variable duration with a minimum of three weeks [
 <xref rid="B37-life-11-00214" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and a maximum of 43 weeks [
 <xref rid="B40-life-11-00214" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] of drug administration in the acute phase [
 <xref rid="B52-life-11-00214" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Regarding psychiatric measures, changes in PTSD Checklist for the DSM-5 (PCL-5) [

 <xref rid="B51-life-11-00214" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] scores were evident. Only one study evaluated the modulation of the amygdala and pre-frontal activation under an acute low dose of THC in patients with and without PTSD and healthy controls (HC) [
 <xref rid="B52-life-11-00214" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Considering outcomes, a reduction in PTSD symptoms (e.g., nightmares, intrusive thoughts, anxiety, arousal) as measured by psychometric scores was detected, as well as a decrease of suicidal thoughts. A decrease of PTSD social impact score from 6.6 to 2.7 as reported in clinical charts [
 <xref rid="B48-life-11-00214" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and an improvement in the quality of life in QOLS score [
 <xref rid="B51-life-11-00214" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and WBQ score [
 <xref rid="B39-life-11-00214" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] after treatment was also demonstrated. Therefore, results showed that cannabinoids (e.g., THC, CBD, nabilone) may be effective in treating PTSD symptoms as clinical response and psychometric scores demonstrated. Furthermore, acute administration of a low dose of cannabinoid acted on corticolimbic responses to threat-related processing. Data from included studies are reported in
