<p>The initial search returned 495 records (MEDLINE/PubMed = 182, Scopus = 182, Web of Science = 131). Among these, 261 were identified as duplicates and were subsequently excluded. Title and abstract screening were performed for the remaining 234 papers, 14 of which were included in the further evaluation. The full-text examination led to the selection of 8 papers. The hand-screening of references led to the inclusion of two additional records. Subsequently, 10 papers were deemed eligible for the present review (see flowchart in
