<p>While CBD is known to bind the G-protein-coupled receptor GPR55, the transient receptor potential of vanilloid type-1 channel (TRPV1), the 5-HT1a receptor, and the α3 and α1 adrenergic receptors, we will focus on the CB1 and CB2 receptors, since they are relevant to the Central Nervous System (CNS) [

Preclinical and clinical studies suggested that CBD, acting also as a negative allosteric modulator of endogenous ligands of CB1 and CB2, may present a beneficial effect in PTSD treatment, enhancing the consolidation of explicit fear extinction and attenuating aversive memories of the traumatic event [

 <sup>9</sup>-THC, a CB1 and CB2 partial agonist, showed a safe and well-tolerated profile in chronic PTSD with a significant improvement in global symptom severity, sleep quality, frequency of nightmares, and hyperarousal symptoms [
