The use of medicinal cannabis for chronic pain symptoms finds wide support in the medical literature given the modulatory effects of the eCBS on inflammation and pain-processing pathways in the central and peripheric nervous systems, mainly relying on CB2 expression in peripheral tissues and immune cells [
