<p>To note, CB receptors are differently expressed in brain areas and nervous cells: CB1 receptors are highly expressed in the cortex, basal ganglia, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and cerebellum while CB2 receptors are mostly expressed in the immune and gastrointestinal cells and they may modulate central and peripheral regions [
 <xref rid="B9-life-11-00214" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. CBD acts on both CB1 and CB2 receptors with lower affinity for Δ
 <sup>9</sup>-THC, producing less adverse effects (e.g., tachycardia, sedation, hunger) but significantly decreasing fear-memory consolidation and anxiety symptoms of PTSD, possibly due to its action on limbic and paralimbic areas [

 <xref rid="B55-life-11-00214" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. CBD can also exert an agonistic action on the 5-HT1a receptor that may explain its antiemetic and anxiolytic-like properties, on the GPR55 enhancing neuronal excitability, and on the TRPV1, highly localized in the hippocampus, reducing anxiety and aversive memories [
 <xref rid="B32-life-11-00214" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The inverse agonist action on CB2 may also explain the anti-inflammatory effects [
 <xref rid="B56-life-11-00214" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Δ
 <sup>9</sup>-THC acts through neuronal presynaptic CB1 receptors as a partial agonist and inhibits directly or indirectly ongoing neurotransmitter release such as dopamine, glutamate, and acetylcholine [
 <xref rid="B55-life-11-00214" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] in the nucleus accumbens, prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala with a consequential reduction in hypervigilance, anxiety, insomnia, nightmares, and extinction deficits related to PTSD [

 <xref rid="B58-life-11-00214" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Nabilone, a synthetic THC analog, is a CB1 receptor agonist and has been demonstrated to reduce recurrent nightmares, flashbacks, and improve sleep time even if the exact mechanism is not yet understood [
