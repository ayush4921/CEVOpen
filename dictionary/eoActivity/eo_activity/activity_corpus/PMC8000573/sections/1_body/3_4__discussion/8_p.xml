<p>Despite promising results on the improvement of quality of life, as well as reduction of the social impact of PTSD, the use of medicinal cannabinoids in this population could also present negative consequences on general well-being due to their abuse and dependence potential [

Except for cannabidiol which is a phyto-derivative of cannabis devoid of any psychotropic effect, the recreational use of cannabis, particularly synthetic compounds with high THC content, may elicit the emergence of psychotic and anxiety symptoms, as well as cognitive dysfunctions [

Conversely, side effects of medicinal cannabinoids (e.g., dizziness, headache, fatigue, gastrointestinal problems) presented mild-to-moderate severity and were relatively well-tolerated, supporting the assumption that subjects with PTSD may consider them less burdensome than approved medications [
