<p>Evidence reported by the included studies presents several limitations. First, most of the considered research is based on small sample sizes, with restricted generalizability of findings. Moreover, heterogeneous samples determine major limitations in the among-study comparability of results. Included studies show low-to-moderate quality and moderate-to-high risk of bias in most cases, which suggests that further studies are expected to address methodological issues to provide solid bases for the use of medicinal cannabinoids in clinical practice. In addition, the retrospective or observational design of most of the included studies precludes conclusions about causality. Only a few RCTs were conducted and comparators were used only in two cases, despite repeated calls for controlled studies that may elucidate the effectiveness of new medications in PTSD treatment [
