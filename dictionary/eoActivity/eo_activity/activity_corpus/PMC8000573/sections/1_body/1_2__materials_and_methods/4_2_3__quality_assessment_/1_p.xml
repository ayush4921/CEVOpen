<p>Considering the heterogeneity of included studies, the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to rate the quality of the evidence [
 <xref rid="B45-life-11-00214" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This was done by two reviewers (EAC and GM) and disagreements were resolved via discussion with one further reviewer (LS jr). The quality of evidence was rated as “high”, “moderate,” “low,” or “very low” based on GRADE rating standards. A “high-quality” rating indicates that future research is very unlikely to change existing evidence and that the true effect is similar to the estimated effect; a “moderate-quality” and a “low-quality” rating indicates that future research may change/is likely to change the evaluation results, respectively; a “very low-quality” rating indicates that it is highly uncertain about the existing evidence and that the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimated effect.
