<p>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder is a particularly heterogeneous clinical entity since it does not invariably exhibit in all subjects the same variety of symptoms and neither do they have similar severity. Moreover, it frequently occurs in comorbidity with other physical or mental disorders. Although there is a robust rationale for the treatment with drugs active, directly or indirectly, on the cannabinoid system and the results to date are promising, further studies are needed to investigate the safety and efficacy profile of their prolonged use. Hopefully, continued research could provide clinicians with novel therapeutic options for a disease that currently is treated with drugs of limited efficacy.</p>
