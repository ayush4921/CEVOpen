<p>The results for histopathological parameters are represented in 
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The results showed that edoema score was significantly higher in the NCG group. It was observed to be significantly lower in the animals treated with the 4% ZMEO-treated group and also in 2% ZMEO and MG-treated groups. The findings implied that the lowest edoema was observed in 4% ZMEO in day 14; meanwhile, there was no observed edoema in the 4% ZMEO group on day 14. The results showed that immune cells were significantly lower in ZMEO groups in day 3 compared to other groups (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), yet it decreased on days 7 and 14 in the ZMEO groups compared to other groups (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). It means that the application of the ZMEO decreases immune cells in days 7 and 14, and increased it on day 3. Angiogenesis (
