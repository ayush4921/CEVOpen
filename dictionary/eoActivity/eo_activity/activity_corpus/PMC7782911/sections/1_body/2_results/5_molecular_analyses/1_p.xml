<p>The results for gene expression are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6</xref>. Gene expression of IL-1β and TNF-α was significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) lower on all sampling days at treated groups compared to the NCG group. The greatest decrease was observed in the 4% ZMEO-treated animals. Gene expressions of IGF-1 and VEGF was significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) higher at all treated groups on day 7 after the wounding, but the levels significantly decreased on day 14. The expression of IL-10 level increased on day 7 whereas it decreased on day 14 compared to the NCG group (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Further analysis of gene expressions of TGF-β and FGF-2 indicate that its level does not have significant difference (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) on day 3, yet its level significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) increased in all treated groups, particularly at 4% ZMEO-treated animals on day 7. The amount of TGF-β and FGF-2 gene expression levels also were significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) reduced on day 14 compared to the NCG group.
