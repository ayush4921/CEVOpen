<p>Concerning the evaluation of the histological parameters, the mice were euthanized by a special CO
 <sub>2</sub> device and the granulation tissue were excised in along to 1 to 2 mm from surrounding normal skin. The samples were fixed in neutral-buffered formalin 10%, routinely processed, and paraffin wax was embedded, sectioned at 5 µm, and stained with Masson’s trichrome and then examined under light microscopy (Olympus CX31RBSF attached cameraman) as reported by Farahpour et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT6612" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Cellular infiltration, edoema and collagen deposition were assessed. An image pro-insight software was utilised for evaluating the collagen deposition. Morphometric lens (Olympus, Germany) was used for assessing the epithelial thickness. edoema was assessed as a 5-score as reported previously (Nejati et al.
