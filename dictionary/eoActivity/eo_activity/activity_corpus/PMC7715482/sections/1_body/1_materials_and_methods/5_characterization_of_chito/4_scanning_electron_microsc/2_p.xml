After complete preparation of essential oil within the chitosan, the samples were fixed in aluminum support with aid of carbon rib, being coated in liquid nitrogen contains gold metal surface to internal structure visualization. After, 1Â h, the coated samples were directly observed under SEM with magnification of ~40.0 x.
