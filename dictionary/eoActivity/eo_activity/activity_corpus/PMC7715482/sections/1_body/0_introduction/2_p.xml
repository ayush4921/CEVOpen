<p id="p0005">Last few decades, the nanoencapsulation of bioactive materials, drugs, and antibiotics using natural biopolymer is attracted significant interest (
 <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">Cui et al., 2018</xref>). Because, natural biopolymers increased all the compound materials after encapsulation including biodegradability, biocompatibility, enhanced stability, gradual drug release capacity, increased stability, highest antimicrobial efficacy and low toxicity. Among the different biopolymers, chitosan is an excellent biopolymer which is used as an encapsulation process, it owing to its biodegradability, biocompatibility and toxicity level 
 <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">Hadidi et al., 2020</xref>. It also delivered as a variety forms like beads, fibers, films and membranes. In addition, the most rich polysaccharide content of highest biodegradable ability containing biopolymer is chitosan (
 <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">Hasheminej et al., 2019</xref>). It is a very well-known biopolymer with increased properties of biodegradable, biocompatible and biomedical. It is an excellent natural polymer that synthesized from chitin through cationic process. It is an important biopolymer driven by alkaline deacetylation process, which is used in the entire field including agriculture, food, environmental, pharmaceutical, biomedical and clinical (

 <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">Maruthupandy et al., 2019</xref>). Previously, more researchers are reported chitosan as carrier a molecule, which is used and increase the drug nature. The increased natures of the drugs are working 80% against various infections after successful delivery of chitosan. Also, chitosan is a functionalized biopolymer, highly used in all the applications including food for packaging, biomedical for anti-bacterial and anti-biofilm activity. In clinical, it is acted as successful carrier molecules for various drugs (
 <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>). Particularly, chitosan is used as a important biological material in food packaging and biomedical applications due to the decreased toxicity nature. Sometimes, chitosan is used to improve the drug nature for improving the anti-microbial and anti-biofilm and anti-oxidant nature that it could expand its applications in food active packaging.
