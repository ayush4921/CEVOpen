<p id="p0075">FT-IR is one of the important techniques that used for detection of possible chemical groups present in the tested materials (
 <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">Rajkumar et al., 2020</xref>). In our study we have confirmed the available functional groups of chitosan and presenting converted chemicals groups of chitosan loaded plant essential oil. The result of our tested material was present in 
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>a, At the peaks of 3388, 2885, 1647, 1538, 1387, 1082, 892, 528 was corresponding to respective chemical groups of —OH and NH stretching, —CH stretching, amide linkages I and II with N—H bending, carboxylic stretching of C—O—C with glucose like ring were exhibited. The exhibited peaks and their respective chemical groups were confirmed that the sample was chitosan (

 </div>O peaks were observed from this process. It has shifted by the process of electrostatic linkage between ammonium ions of chitosan and phosphoric ions of TPP in nanoparticles. Further, after addition of purified guva essential oils into the chitosan, the peaks were exhibited with 3457, 2211, 1641 and 506 cm

 </div>O stretching, C—C aromatic ring stretch, CH2 bend and C—H aromatic bend. The result was clearly indicated that the essential oil was successfully loaded into the chitosan-TPP mixture (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>b). The resulted absorption peaks of FT-IR result was indicated as same wave number. In addition, among the combination of chitosan-TPP-essential oils, the C—H stretching peak intensity was significantly increased due to the loading efficiency of essential oils. The exhibited peaks of 2866–2925 and 1238 cm
 <sup>-1</sup> clearly indicated that the essential oils were successfully loaded in to the chitosan nanoparticles. Our result was agreed by recent report of 
 <xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">Su et al. (2020)</xref>, and the chemical groups of the shifted places were exhibited the loading efficiency of essential oils into chitosan. Supported evidence was published by K. 
 <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">Myszka, et al. (2020)</xref>, and the shifted peaks without change of wave number containing chitosan loaded essential oil combination were successful. Therefore, our result was confirmed that the guva essential oils were encapsulated into the chitosan nanoparticles without inclusion of any chemical reaction. The unchanged structure and role of the chitosan loaded essential oils were indicated that the nanomaterial increased their biological properties (
