<p id="p0085">The DMSO diluted chitosan loaded essential oil was showed increased anti-bacterial activity against tested

 <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">Rieger and Schiffman, 2014</xref>. Previously the guva leaf extract was showed with 10, 12 mm zone of inhibition against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> respectively. Interestingly, our resulted chitosan loaded essential oils material was exhibited with 22 mm zone of inhibition against tested multi drug resistant 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> at 70 µg/mL concentration (
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). This concentration was very low compared with previous reported essential oil loaded chitosan (
 <xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">Tatiana et al., 2018</xref>). Our result was suggested that the increased zone of inhibition may stimulate by chitosan. The available essential oil compounds of

 <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">Mishra et al., 2018</xref> may play a anti-bacterial inhibition role against 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> in this study. These compounds are major compounds in guva essential oils. Our result was also agreed by previous documented reports of Hasheminej et al. (2020), and clove essential oils β-Pinene, Thujene and β-Farnesene have excellent anti-microbial properties. In mechanistic role, the chitosan loaded essential oils may enter in inside of the cytoplasm through ion channels and leads to membrane damage and protein damage. After the cytoplasmic leakages were done continuously and the production of pathogenicity molecules were lost.
