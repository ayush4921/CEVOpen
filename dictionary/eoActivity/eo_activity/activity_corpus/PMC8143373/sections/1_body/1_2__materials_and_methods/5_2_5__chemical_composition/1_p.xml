<p>For determination of the chemical composition of basil, black seeds, and lavender EOs, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis was conducted using GC-2010 Shimadzu capillary gas chromatography directly coupled to the mass spectrometer system (GC-MS–model QP 2010; (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) DB-c18 column under following conditions: Injector temperature is 250 °C. Oven temperature program: initial temperature 30 °C for 2.0 min, ramp 2.0 °C/min to 250 °C, hold for 5.0 min. MS source temperature is 200 °C, electron energy is 70 eV; the carrier gas was helium at a flow rate 1.4 mL/min; 1 µL of each diluted sample in n-hexane (1:1,

The components of the sample were identified based on a comparison of their relative indices and mass spectra by computer matching with WILEY and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST08) libraries provided with the computer controlling GC-MS system [
