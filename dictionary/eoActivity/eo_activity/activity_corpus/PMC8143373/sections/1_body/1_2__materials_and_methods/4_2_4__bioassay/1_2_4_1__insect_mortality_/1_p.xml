<p>To determine the mortality effect of the studied EOs against 
 <italic>Sitophilus oryzae</italic> against 
 <italic>Sitophilus oryzae</italic>, contact effect was evaluated on filter paper discs through treatment of a Whatman No.1, 8 cm diameter, area = 54.4 cm
 <sup>2</sup>). The filter paper discs were treated with 0.5 mL of acetonic solutions of EOs, and in the control treatment, the filter paper disc was treated with an equal volume of acetone. The four replicates for each treatment from different EOs solutions were tested corresponding to their doses (2, 4, and 6 mg/cm
 <sup>2</sup>) compared with positive control treatment and 10 ppm of the chemical standard malathion. Treated and control filter paper halves were air-dried for 1 h for solvent evaporation. Then, 10 unsexed adult beetles (3–7 days old) were released in the filter paper center, and the lid was then sealed with Parafilm. The experiment was run in the dark at 28 ± 2 °C and 65 ± 5% RH. The dead insects were counted at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h post-application. Insects without response to the gentle touch of a small probe were considered dead [
