<p>qRT-PCR analysis was performed for three insecticidal detoxification genes (CL8, CL1294, and CYP4Q4) in 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic> adults treated with three selected EOs using SYBR Green Master Mix method utilizing a Rotor-Gene 6000 real-time PCR detection system (Qiagen, Germany). The primer sequences used in qRT- PCR mentioned in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00829-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> were designed corresponding to the CL8, CL1294, and CYP4Q4 genes. β-Actin gene was used as an internal control gene. For each gene three replicates were used for qRT-PCR reaction; reaction volume of 25 μL contained 12.5 μL of 1×SYBR GREEN PCR mix (TaKaRa Code: RR041A), 1 μL 1:10 diluted cDNA templates, 1 μL sets of each primer and 9.5 μL Rnase free double distilled water according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RT-qPCR was amplified in 3-step and 45 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s, and 60 °C for 30 s and 70 °C for 30 s. Data of qRT-PCR were collected as CT (PCR cycle number where fluorescence is detected above the threshold). The CT of each sample was used to calculate ΔCT values (target gene CT subtracted from 18sRNA gene CT). The relative gene expression of studied genes was determined using the 2
 <sup>−ΔΔCt</sup> method [

 <xref rid="B45-plants-10-00829" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Data from PCR runs were analyzed in the MyiQ optical system software version 1.0 (Bio Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). The expression quantity of expressed genes was calculated according to the Sigma Plot version 9.0 software (Systat Software Inc.: San Jose, CA, USA).
