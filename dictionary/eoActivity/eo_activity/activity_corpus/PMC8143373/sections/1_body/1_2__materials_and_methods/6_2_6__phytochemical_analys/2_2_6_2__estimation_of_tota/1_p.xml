<p>Total flavonoid content in three studied EOs was determined by the colorimetric method [
 <xref rid="B42-plants-10-00829" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. About 300 μL of three studied EOs were mixed with 30 μL of 16% NaNO
 <sub>2</sub>. The mixture was then maintained at room temperature for 1 h, and 200 μL of NaOH solution (1 M) was added, followed by 60 μL of 10% AlCl
 <sub>3</sub>, and 700 μL H
 <sub>2</sub>O was then added to the mixture. The volume of the mixture was completed up to 1 mL with distilled water. The absorbance of the mixture was measured at 510 nm. The results were expressed as mg of rutin equivalent per gram of fresh weight (mg RE/g FW).
