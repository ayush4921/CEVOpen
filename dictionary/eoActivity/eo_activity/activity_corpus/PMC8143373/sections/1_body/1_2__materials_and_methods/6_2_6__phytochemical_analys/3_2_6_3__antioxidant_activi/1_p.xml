<p>To assay the free radical scavenging capacity of the investigated EOs on the stable free radical 1, 1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) was determined according to [
 <xref rid="B42-plants-10-00829" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Typically, 100 μL of DPPH (0.004% prepared in methanol) were mixed with 0.1 mL of tested EOs or vitamin C (reference). The plate was mixed by shaking, wrapped with aluminum foil, and then maintained for 30–60 min at 25 °C in a dark place. colors ranged from deep violet to light yellow, and the decrease in absorbance was measured at 517 nm. The DPPH was calculated from the following equation:
