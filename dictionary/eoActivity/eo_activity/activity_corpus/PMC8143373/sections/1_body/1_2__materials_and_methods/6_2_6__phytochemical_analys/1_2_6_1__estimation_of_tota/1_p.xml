<p>Total phenolic content in three studied essential oils was determined using the Folin Ciocalteu (FC) method of Su [
 <xref rid="B38-plants-10-00829" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] method with slight modifications as prepared at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. A calibration curve was prepared using gallic acid (1â€“0.05 mg/mL). Then, 1 mL of 
 <italic>O. basilicum, N. sativa,</italic> and 
 <italic>L. angustifolia</italic> EOs or gallic acid was added to 0.5 mL of FC reagent and was vortexed well, followed by standing at room temperature for 5 min. Then, 1 mL, 7.5% 
 <italic>w/v,</italic> of sodium carbonate, was added and maintained for 1 h at room temperature. The absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 760 nm. TPC was expressed as mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/g sample.
