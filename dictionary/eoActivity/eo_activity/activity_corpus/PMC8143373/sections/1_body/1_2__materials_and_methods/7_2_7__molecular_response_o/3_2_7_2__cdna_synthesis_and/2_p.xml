 <sub>2</sub>, 2.5 μL dNTPs (2.5 mM), and 0.2 μL reverse transcriptase (MLV, Fermentas, USA) (5 Unit/μL). RT-PCR amplification was performed in a thermal cycler (Promega, Germany), programmed at 42 °C for 1 h and the enzyme was killed at 72 °C for 10 min. The cDNA was then stored for further studies at −20 °C [
