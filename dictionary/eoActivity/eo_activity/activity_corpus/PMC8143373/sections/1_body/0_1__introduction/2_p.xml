<p>In developing countries, loss of cereal foods is considered the major problem due to pest infections through storage [

Additionally, insecticides have a dangerous impact on the malformation of food grains because of residues and harmfulness of synthetic chemicals to non-target organisms in surroundings. Besides, the use of these insecticides resulted in chromosomal aberration and genetic mutation in both plant and human [
