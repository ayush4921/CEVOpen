<p>In recent years, there are a variety of detoxification enzymes encoded in insect genomes, including glutathione S-transferase (GST), cytochrome oxidase P450 (CYP), and carboxylesterase (CarE, also known as CCE/EST/CES) [

 <xref rid="B34-plants-10-00829" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] that have potential activities in xenobiotic compounds detoxification. Furthermore, transcriptional regulation of gene expression of GST, CarE, and AchE enzymes in insects after insecticide application has been utilized for understanding the insect response and insecticidal mechanism to various xenobiotic compounds stresses [

 <italic>Lavandula angustifolia</italic> medicinal plants against the stored product insect pest 
 <italic>Sitophilus oryzae</italic> (L.). According to the economic importance of rice and its loss in quantity and quality by

 <italic>Sitophilus oryzae</italic> adult stage; (2) screening chemical composition of the studied essential oils using GC-MS; and, finally (3) estimation significant roles of the three crucial detoxification enzymes related genes (Cl8, CYP 4Q4, and CL1294) in the response of
