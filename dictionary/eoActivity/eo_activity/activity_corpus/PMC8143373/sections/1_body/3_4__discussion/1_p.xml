<p>This study assesses the toxicity effect of three selected EOs (basil, black seeds, and Lavender) against 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic>. The highest insecticidal activity was recorded using basil and lavender EOs with 100% mortality effect. Pesticide disinfection is the most important method for the protection of the stored cereals and grains against insects [

 <xref rid="B52-plants-10-00829" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In this study, Lavender EO had the highest toxicity activity for rice weevils with 100% mortality effect at 6 mg/cm
 <sup>2</sup> at 12 and 48 h exposure time, in addition to the basil EO also had the highest mortality percentage 100% at 6 mg/cm
 <sup>2</sup> at 12 h, this result was in agreed with [

 <italic>S. oryzae</italic> and 
 <italic>C. maculatus</italic> through assessment of repellence and progeny production. Quick repellence activity in this study was highest for basil EO that recorded 61.2% for 0.75 mg/cm
 <sup>2</sup> after 1 h against adult 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic> where repellence reached 82% after 5 h, theses result like results of [
 <xref rid="B54-plants-10-00829" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], that reported repellence against 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic> after 1 h was 91.1%.
