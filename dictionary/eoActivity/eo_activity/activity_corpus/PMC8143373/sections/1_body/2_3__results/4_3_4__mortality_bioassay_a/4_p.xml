<p>For 
 <italic>L. angustifolia</italic> EOs, the highest significant mortality of 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic> adult stages was represented in the highest concentration 6 mg/cm
 <sup>2</sup> at all exposure times. The highest percentage of 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic> mortality 100% was recorded at 6 mg/cm
 <sup>2</sup> after 48 and 24 h compared to their control values at 48 and 24 h were 100 and 98.2%, respectively, followed by 98.2 and 80.8% for 6 mg/cm
 <sup>2</sup> at 24 and 12 h, respectively (

 <italic>S. oryzae</italic> mortality; 
 <italic>L. angustifolia</italic> EOs recorded the highest percentage of mortality 100% at exposure time 48 and 24 h, followed by 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic> recorded the percentage of mortality 100 and 98.2% at 48 and 24 h, respectively.
