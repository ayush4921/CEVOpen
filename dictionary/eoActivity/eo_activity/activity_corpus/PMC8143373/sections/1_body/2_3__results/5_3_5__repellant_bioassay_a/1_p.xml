<p>In general, the repellant percentage in 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic> adult stage increased with increasing the concentrations of three studied EOs and increasing exposure times. Regarding 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic> EOs results in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00829-f004">Figure 4</xref>, the highest significant repellency of 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic> was recorded as 82.3% for 0.75 mg/cm
 <sup>2</sup> at 5 h compared to control (4 ppm malathion) at 5 h with the value of 93.2%, followed by 78.3 and 69.7% for 0.75 mg/cm
 <sup>2</sup> at 4 and 3 h, respectively, while the lowest significant repellency value was 54.2% at 0.25 mg/cm
