<p>For 
 <italic>L. angustifolia</italic> EOs, obtained results in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00829-f006">Figure 6</xref> showed that the highest repellency percentage of 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic> adult stages increasing with increasing the concentration of EOs (0.25, 0.5, and at all exposure times). The highest significant repellence activity of 
 <italic>L. angustifolia</italic> EO was recorded at 0.75 mg/cm
 <sup>2</sup> after 5 h with the value of 77.5% after 5 h versus its control (4 ppm malathion) was 93.2% after the same exposure time, followed by 74.6 and 67.8% for 0.75 mg/cm
 <sup>2</sup> after 4 and 3 h, respectively. While the lowest repellency value was 45.6% at 0.25 mg/cm
 <sup>2</sup>. On the other hand, the lowest significant repellency value was 45.6% at 0.25 mg/cm
 <sup>2</sup>
 <italic>L. angustifolia</italic> after 1 h.
