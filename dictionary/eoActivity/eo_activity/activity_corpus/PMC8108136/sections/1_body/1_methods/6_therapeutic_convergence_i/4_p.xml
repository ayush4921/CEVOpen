 <italic>Azadirachta indica</italic> A. Juss. (Neem) (Dongoyaro, Margosa) Meliaceae, is a medicinal plant with more than 140 chemically active compounds isolated from the different parts including its flowers, leaves, seeds, roots, fruits, and bark and had been employed in managing many diseases. The active compounds have been identified as anti-inflammatory, anti-ulcer, anti-hyperglycaemic, immune-modulator, anti-mutagenic, anti-oxidant, antiviral and anti-carcinogenic drugs. The earliest three active constituents to be characterized namely nimbin 
 <bold>(81)</bold>, nimbidin 
 <bold>(126)</bold> and nimbinene 
 <bold>(127)</bold> were described in 1942. Since then several compounds have been isolated and characterized and were shown to be chemically similar and biogenetically derivable from a tetracyclicterpenes. The neem kernel accumulates liminoids responsible for the bitterness and also found in other plant species such as Rutaceae and Simaroubaceae. Their biological activities include pesticides, antifeedants and cytotoxic properties. The leaves yielded quercetin 
 <bold>(73)</bold> and nimbosterol as well as liminoids (nimbin and its derivatives). Quercetin 
 <bold>(73)</bold> and Beta-sitosterol 
 <bold>(85)</bold> were the first flavonoid and phytosterol purified from the fresh leaves of neem and were known to have antifungal and antibacterial activities (

 <italic>Azadirachta indica</italic> is due to the rich source of antioxidant and other valuable active compounds which include azadirachtin 
 <bold>(84)</bold>, nimbolinin 
 <bold>(87)</bold>, nimbin 
 <bold>(81)</bold>, nimbidin 
 <bold>(126)</bold>, nimidol 
 <bold>(89)</bold>, salannin 
 <bold>(83)</bold> and quercetin 
 <bold>(73</bold>). An earlier study reported the virucidal activity of the leaf extract of 
 <italic>A. indica</italic> against Coxsackievirus B-4 whose mechanism was proposed to be via interference with an early stage of the virus replication cycle (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Badam et al., 1999</xref>). In a recent study, the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> intraperitoneal administration of methanol extracts of 
 <italic>A. indica</italic> at a dose of 25 mg/kg body weight to murine hepatitis virus infected mice significantly reduced the expression of viral Nucleocapsid protein at the acute stage of infection. Since the murine hepatitis virus represents a prototype coronavirus, the therapeutic potential of the flavonoid, phytosterol and terpenoid-rich extracts of 
 <italic>A indica</italic> has been reinforced [
 <bold>Level V</bold>]. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic>, Neuro-2A cell-line treated with 200 μg/ml methanol extracts of 
 <italic>A. indica</italic> inhibited virus-induced cell-to-cell fusion (
 <xref rid="B239" ref-type="bibr">Sarkar et al., 2020</xref>). More recently, a computational prediction of SARS-CoV-2 structural protein inhibitors from 
 <italic>A.</italic> indica indicated their potential to inhibit the functionality of membrane and envelope proteins [
 <bold>Level IV*</bold>] (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Borkotoky and Banerjee, 2020</xref>). The free radical scavenging activity has been linked to the presence of nimbolide 
 <bold>(88)</bold> and azadirachtin 
 <bold>(84)</bold> while the anti-inflammatory activity is thought to be via the regulation of proinflammatory enzyme activities including cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) enzyme (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Biswas K. et al., 2020</xref>) [
 <bold>Level IV</bold>]. This plant, although a component of some polyherbal antimalarial remedies including 
 <italic>MAMA</italic> Decoction, has not been extensively validated preclinically, clinically and standardized as an anti-infective remedy and therefore deserves further scientific attention especially as a potential herbal remedy in COVID-19 treatment.
