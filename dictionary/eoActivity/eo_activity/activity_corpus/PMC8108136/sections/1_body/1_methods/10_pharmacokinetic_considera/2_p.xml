<p>Such multi-component systems natively form a core aspect of plant-derived preparations which range from crude extracts, to carefully designed fractional combinations, and to a lower extent pure natural products. Since most component active principles exist in lower amounts than found in mainstream pharmaceuticals, toxicities from these preparations are generally rarer especially when prepared using properly validated quality assurance processes or following some local preparation methods. Additionally benefit results from the presence of multiple natural products capable of modulating multiple aspects of the biochemical process of interest, a property that is of special interest in antiviral and antimalarial management. Interestingly, some of these botanicals have been suggested to produce strong biological effects even at the low concentrations at which they are present in herbal preparations (
