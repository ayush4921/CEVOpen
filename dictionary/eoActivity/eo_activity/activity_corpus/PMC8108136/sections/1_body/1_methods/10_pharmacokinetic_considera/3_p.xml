<p>Since the pharmacodynamic effects resulting from herb-based preparations eventually depend on the component principles interacting with biological macromolecules, their successful use also depends critically on pharmacokinetics. With respect to the pharmacokinetics of herbal products, the simultaneous presence of multiple structurally distinct natural products in the same preparation presents a definite layer of challenge not seen with single compound pharmaceuticals but that is often of clinical significance (
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">Fugh-Berman, 2000</xref>). Each natural product present in such multi-component preparations possess physicochemical attributes that are often divergent such that it is hardly realistic to describe the overall pharmacokinetics based on a single natural product however significant such compound may be. Instead, it is sometimes more prudent to define these parameters for the bulk product based on an all-or-none basis rather than merely trying to extrapolate the properties from data derived for individual natural products. This was aptly demonstrated in a 2013 study showing the strong CYP3A4-inhibiting activity of an African herbal preparation NIPRD-AM1 with antimalarial activities (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Bulus Adzu et al., 2013</xref>). NIPRD-AM1 was developed in Nigeria and found to be responsible for diminishing by half the enzymatic activity of the cytochrome P450 enzyme, but following co-administration with metronidazole it was reported to exert no effect on the metabolic disposition of the drug (
 <xref rid="B201" ref-type="bibr">Obodozie et al., 2011</xref>). It is certainly not inconceivable to expect to find present individual natural products with varied effects on the hepatic enzymes in such herbal formulations as NIPRD-AM1; it is however the overall effect of the mixture that is of practical importance for quality assurance as well as for clinical applicability especially involving the analysis of interference with different metabolizing enzymes and with the absorption process of drugs that are likely to be co-administered.
