As a result, the WHO and African CDC are cooperating with and supporting the government to design and conduct clinical trials to validate the efficacy and possible adverse effects of CVO polyherbal formulation. This may involve multi-centre clinical trials involving countries in Africa such as Tanzania, Equatorial Guinea and Congo-Brazzaville that had received the herbal remedy (
