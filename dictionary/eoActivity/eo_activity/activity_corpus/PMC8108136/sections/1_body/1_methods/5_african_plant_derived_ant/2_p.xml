<p>Phytomedicines with a long history of use in traditional medicines and bioactive compounds obtained from them have been shown to exert antiviral, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects and these bioactivities have been proposed to be linked (
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">Fialho et al., 2016</xref>), following their ability to modulate the immune response (

 <italic>Combretum micranthum</italic> G. Don is one of the main constituents of an indigenous Nigerian antiviral phytomedicine called “Seven Keys to Power” used in the traditional management of smallpox, chicken pox, measles and HIV/AIDS (
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">Esimone et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, 
 <italic>R. capparoides</italic> has been used by herbalists in the eastern part of Nigeria for the treatment of chickenpox, smallpox and hepatitis, while 
 <italic>C. cajan</italic> is used in ethnoveterinary medicine for the treatment of several viral diseases of cattles in Northern Nigeria (
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">Esimone et al., 2005</xref>). However, rigorous, robust and well validated scientific investigations are needed to turn these potential antiviral remedies to clinical use. At this time, these data are not available, thus limiting their application.
