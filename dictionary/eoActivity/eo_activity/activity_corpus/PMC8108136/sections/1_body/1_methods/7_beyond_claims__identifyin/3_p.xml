<p>In Nigeria, the social media, television, internet and radio media have been flooded with claims of symptomatic treatment, cure or prevention of COVID-19. Many of these anecdotal claims flying over the virtual space have provided African researchers starting points for a plant-derived drug discovery studies against COVID-19; many of the claims have originated from eminent Nigerians such as the traditional leader of the Yoruba nation, religious prophets and Priests, Botanists, Biochemists and a host of Nigerian scientists in academia; several of these claims are currently under scientific investigation for adverse effects and efficacy. Officially, the Nigerian government has not approved or authorized the use of any indigenous phytomedicine to combat COVID-19, reason being that no herbal remedy currently claimed to prevent, manage or cure the infectious disease has been taken through a rigorous scientific investigation via clinical trials. Meanwhile, the Nigerian government through the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) is now processing not less than 21 herbal formulations for “safe use” under listing status. These polyherbal formulations according to NAFDAC, have been claimed to boost immunity with a parallel anti-infective activity capable of providing relief to symptoms associated with COVID-19. More so, a documented evidence of clinical trial which is required to support efficacy claims is lacking until the time of this writing. However, the Bioresources Development Group (BDG), Abuja, Nigeria; International Center for Ethnomedicine and Drug Development (InterCEDD) Nsukka, Nigeria, has submitted the previously NAFDAC listed IHP Detox tea for clinical trials which is titled: “Efficacy and safety of IHP Detox Tea (a special blend of
