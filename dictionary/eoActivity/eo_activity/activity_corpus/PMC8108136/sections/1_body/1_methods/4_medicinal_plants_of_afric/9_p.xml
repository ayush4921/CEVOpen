<p>Another study involving human subjects, carried out in collaboration with herbal practitioners in different districts of Uganda, revealed that HIV-positive patients showed a treatment outcome with significant decrease in CD4 positive T-cell lymphocytes in the blood when treated with

 <italic>Erythrina abyssinica</italic> Lam. (Fabaceae), 
 <italic>Nauclea latifolia</italic> Sm (Rubiaceae)
 <italic>, Psorospermum febrifugum</italic> Spach (Hypericaceae), 
 <italic>Mangifera indica</italic> L. (Anacardiaceae), and

 <italic>.</italic> The use of 
 <italic>Calendula officinalis</italic> L([Asteraceae) have also been shown to result in progressive decline in viral loads and in CD4 T-cell counts in HIV-positive volunteers (
 <xref rid="B184" ref-type="bibr">Mills et al., 2005</xref>). However, these human studies lack adequate comparative data so that it remains unclear whether the patient recovered because of the use of particular herbal preparation or the general clinical care received. While findings from this study may be of interest, there is need for further investigation to establish an elaborate toxicological data, 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence and clinical proof of safety and efficacy. These documented antiviral African medicinal plants hold promise in the ambitious search for potent medicines to defeat the lethal COVID-19 pandemic [
