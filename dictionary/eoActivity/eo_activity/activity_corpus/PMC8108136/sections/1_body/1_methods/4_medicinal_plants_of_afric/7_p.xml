  <italic>Rapanea melanophloeos</italic> (L.) Mez
 </ext-link> (Primulaceae) were reported by Mehrbod et al. (
 <xref rid="B177" ref-type="bibr">Mehrbod et al., 2018a</xref>) to have inhibitory effect against influenza A virus (IAV). The activity of the extracts resulted in averages of 7.4 and five logs hemagglutination (HA) decrements for 
 <italic>R. melanophloeos</italic> and 
 <italic>P. viridiflorum</italic>, respectively. This shows the potency of the plants against IAV (
 <xref rid="B177" ref-type="bibr">Mehrbod et al., 2018a</xref>). In another study, Mehrbod and colleagues again evaluated the activity of a glycoside flavone 
 <bold>(73)</bold> (quercetin-3-O-α-L-rhamnopyranoside) isolated from 
 <italic>R. melanophloeos</italic> against IAV. Quercetin-3-O-α-L-rhamnopyranoside 
 <bold>(73)</bold> was reported to decrease the virus titer at 150 μg/ml by directly inhibiting the virus replication, and modulation of cytokine production (
 <xref rid="B176" ref-type="bibr">Mehrbod et al., 2018b</xref>). Research evidence supports the antiviral activity and more specifically, anti-COVID-19 potentials of a combination of quercetin and vitamin C, some common components of the mainly polyherbal extracts used in TAM (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Colunga Biancatelli et al., 2020</xref>) [
 <bold>Level III</bold>]. Interestingly, emerging evidence suggests that the anti-SARS-2 activity of glycosylated forms of flavonoids may be significantly higher than their respective aglycons while plant extracts and fractions may be significantly more effective than isolated pure compounds (
 <xref rid="B288" ref-type="bibr">Zakaryan et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">da Silva Antonio et al., 2020</xref>). However, the indigenous formulations containing these plant species require preclinical and clinical standardization for evidence-informed application and for a possible clinical use.
