<p>There are several compounds from various African plants that have been proven to have antimalarial properties which may provide researchers with starting points for antiviral drug discovery. Indoles with antimalarial properties have been derived from two plants species growing in Cameroon such as 
 <italic>Penianthus longifolius</italic> Miers (Menispermaceae) and 
 <italic>Glossocalyx longicuspis</italic> Benth (Siparunaceae). The compounds include Palmitine 
 <bold>(130)</bold> from 
 <italic>P. longifolius</italic> Miers, Linodenine from 
 <italic>G. brevipes</italic> Benth. Also from Nigeria plant, there is Fagaronine 
 <bold>(128)</bold> from 
 <italic>Fagara zanthoxyloides</italic> Lam. (Rutaceae) and Alstonine 
 <bold>(129)</bold> from 
 <italic>Picralima nitida</italic> (Stapf) T. Durand and H. Durand (family Apocynaceae). 
 <italic>Triphyophyllum peltatum</italic> (Hutch. and Dalziel) Airy Shaw (Dioncophyllacea) is a tropical African plant from which a potent antimalarial alkaloid, Habropetaline A 
 <bold>(131)</bold> was isolated. The compound showed good effect against 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, without cytotoxicity, with respective IC
 <sub>50</sub> values 5.0 and 2.3 ng ml
 <sup>−1</sup> for the strains K1 (Chloroquine and pyrimethamine resistant) and NF54 (sensitive to all known drugs). It was found to be almost as active as artemisinin and one of the most potent natural products used against 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Bringmann et al., 2003</xref>). There are several observations that point to the fact that naphthoisoquinoline alkaloids are promising lead compounds for the development of anti-malarial drugs which of course could be tried against viral pathogens. Cryptolepines 
 <bold>(36)</bold> from 
 <italic>Sida acuta</italic> Burm.f. (Malvaceae), a plant growing in Ivory coast showed a good antimalarial activity (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Banzouzi et al., 2004</xref>). 
 <italic>Cryptolepis sanguinolenta</italic> (Lindl.) Schltr. of the family Periplocaceae growing in diverse regions in Africa, have also exhibited potent anti-malarial properties (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Ablordeppey et al., 1990</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Cimanga et al., 1999</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Barku et al., 2012</xref>). Following a recently reported 
 <italic>in silico</italic> experiments, several of these antimalarial alkaloids from African plants have shown interesting predicted inhibition of SARS CoV-2 viral proteins [
 <bold>Level IV</bold>] (
 <xref rid="B151" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Borquaye et al., 2020</xref>) and this support the need for further 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and clinical investigation on their therapeutic potential for COVID-19 treatment.
