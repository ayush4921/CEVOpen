<p>The use of phytomedicines as adjuvants in the therapeutic treatment of diseases has received a drawback due to the occurrence of deleterious herb-drug interactions (
 <xref rid="B231" ref-type="bibr">Rivera and Loya, 2013</xref>). A typical medicinal plant is a biological laboratory of hundreds of bioactive metabolites with significant influence on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs when co-administered or used as adjuvants. The co-administration of orthodox drugs alongside herbal medicines may bring about pharmacodynamic interactions that may result in synergistic, additive or antagonistic pharmacological end-points. More so, an important consequence of herb-drug interactions is the pharmacokinetic dimension that alters the level of the drug in systemic circulation. This may result from the activity of the herbs leading to elevation or inhibition of the function of certain drug metabolizing enzymes or efflux transporters. As a rule of the thumb, the bioavailabilities of bioactive compounds are enhanced by the inhibition of drug metabolizing enzymes or efflux transporters; in contrast, induction of drug metabolizing enzymes or efflux transporters reduces drug bioavailability (

Hence, precautionary measures and adequate monitoring (pharmacovigilance) are essential when co-administering drugs with narrow therapeutic window or safety margin with herbs as any variation in plasma concentrations can result in adverse events or treatment failure (
