 <italic>Allium</italic> species (
 <italic>Allium cepa</italic> and 
 <italic>Allium sativum</italic>) are widely used in Traditional African medicines for the management of infectious diseases and has since been regularly canvassed by some of the COVID-19 infected users in West Africa for the prevention and symptomatic management of COVID-19. These species are among the recipes recommended by the traditional leadership of the Yoruba ethnic nationality in Nigeria and are claimed to be efficacious in COVID-19 prevention and “cure”. Garlic oil, obtained from 
 <italic>A. sativum</italic> bulb contains sulfur-compounds such as diallyl sulfide 
 <bold>(69)</bold> (DAS), diallyl disulfide 
 <bold>(70)</bold> (DADS), and diallyl trisulfide 
 <bold>(71)</bold> (DATS) which induce CYP2B and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1). DAS 
 <bold>(69)</bold> facilitate the induction of CYP2B10 mRNA and also activate human CYP2B6 and NQO1 promoters which are primarily regulated by constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) transcription factors, respectively (
