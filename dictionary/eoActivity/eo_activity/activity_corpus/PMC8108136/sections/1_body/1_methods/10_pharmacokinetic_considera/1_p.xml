<p>The popular school of thought tends toward the discovery of a single metabolite specific for one macromolecular target. However, modern medicine via the formulation of multi-component medications containing two, three, or more active components is increasingly accepting the limits of the single-molecule hypothesis. Such multi-component medications are of special importance in anti-infective therapies, and in fact have become the obligatory standard of management in malaria, a protozoan infection, tuberculosis a bacterial infection, and acquired immune deficiency syndrome a viral infection. The overarching aim is to employ the combined drug compounds to target multiple macromolecular targets.</p>
