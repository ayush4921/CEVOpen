<p>Cos and colleagues (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Cos et al., 2002a</xref>) reported some African plants that are active against poliomyelitis, coxsackie, semliki forest, measles, and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). The antiviral activity of the extracts investigated was determined as the reduction factor (RF) of the viral titer which is interpreted as the ratio of the virus titer in the absence and in the presence of the extract. The leaves of 
 <italic>Macaranga kilimandscharica</italic> Pax (Euphorbiaceae) exhibited considerable 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> effect against measles. The 80% ethanol extracts were found to block the viral replication of Coxsackie and Measles. The leaf extracts of 
 <italic>Guizotia scabra (Vis.)</italic> Chiov. (Asteraceae) were active against Coxsackie and Polio, while 
 <italic>Pavetta ternifolia</italic> Hiern (Rubiaceae) (leaves) was shown to display high activity against only Coxsackie. The leaves of 
 <italic>Eriosema montanum</italic> Baker f. (Fabaceae) have been reported to have considerable activity against all the tested viruses. The stems of 
 <italic>Entada abyssinica (EnE)</italic> Steud. ex A. Rich (Fabaceae) were highly potent against Polio while displaying intermediate efficacy against other viruses tested with the exception of Measles. The leaves of 
 <italic>EnE</italic> have profound antiviral effects against Semliki forest virus (

 <italic>Syzygium brazzavillense</italic> Aubr√©v. and Pellegr. (Myrtaceae) against coxsackievirus (CV) and poliovirus type 1 was revealed by Badia- Boungou et al. The extract was found to inhibit replication of CVB4 in HEp-2 cell cultures and also limit the cytopathic effect (CPE) induced by type 1 polioviruses and by CVB2, CVB3, and CVB4 (

 <italic>in vivo</italic> data as well as elaborate and mechanistic 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> investigations will be required to support the current preliminary 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> findings.
