<p>Plant-derived cysteine knot peptides including antimicrobial peptides and defensins whose bioactivities like other types of defensins are able to block viral infection by clustering the viral particles and blocking receptor binding (
 <xref rid="B197" ref-type="bibr">Nguyen et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B271" ref-type="bibr">Weber, 2020</xref>). These hormone-like disulphide-stabilized peptides have been described to mediate in the inhibition of viral entry, viral particle disruption, interference with essential cell signaling or viral gene expression, or by other poorly-understood mechanisms. Furthermore, in addition to the direct antiviral activities outlined above, antimicrobial peptides and defensins modulate adaptive immune responses following their ability to attract immune cells (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>) are well distributed in tropical African flora within the Apocynaceae, Rubiaceae, Violaceae, Curcubitaceae, Leguminoseae, Poaceae and Fabaceae plant families (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Molecular studies have shown that these suites of peptides bind to viral spike and membrane proteins (
 <xref rid="B197" ref-type="bibr">Nguyen et al., 2016</xref>) and may therefore be early acting in preventing viral attachment and entry into the host cell. As some of the most exploited plant families in TAM (with the exception of Violaceae), plants species from them could help in COVID-19 treatment [
 <bold>Level V</bold>] and therefore deserve further anti-SARS CoV-2 molecular studies. Interestingly, knottin peptidyl therapeutics are stable to extreme conditions and easily extracted under aqueous mediums commonly used in TAM. Unfortunately, despite their emerging therapeutic potentials, research in cysteine knotted polypeptides has not received adequate scientific attention as less than 1% of African flora has been screened for peptide drug discovery (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Attah et al., 2016a</xref>). Carbohydrate-binding lectin proteins from African Musa species and 
 <italic>Canavalia ensiformis (L.) DC.</italic> Fabaceae have shown interesting broad spectrum antiviral. However, the clinical application of lectin proteins will require further in-depth research to circumvent inherent limitations including toxicity, stability and bioavailability in order to ensure that their druggable targets will offer a therapeutic benefit (
