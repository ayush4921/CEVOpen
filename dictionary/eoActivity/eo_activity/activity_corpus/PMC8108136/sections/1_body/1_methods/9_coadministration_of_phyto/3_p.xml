<p>Western drugs which have so far attracted attention as potential treatment options for COVID-19 include chloroquine 
 <bold>(158)</bold>, hydroxychloroquine 
 <bold>(159)</bold>, azithromycin 
 <bold>(160)</bold>, ceftriaxone 
 <bold>(161)</bold> (for patients with pneumonia), remdesivir 
 <bold>(162)</bold>, favipiravir 
 <bold>(163)</bold>, ribavirin 
 <bold>(164)</bold>, lopinavirâ€“ritonavir 
 <bold>(165)</bold> (used in combination) and of recent dexamethasone that have been shown to reduce mortality rate of COVID- 19 patients. The CYP enzymes such as CYP2C8, CYP3A4, CYP2D6 and CYP1A1 can metabolize chloroquine (

 <xref rid="B134" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2003</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">Gil and Gil Berglund, 2007</xref>) and catalyzes the dealkylation of chloroquine 
 <bold>(158)</bold> and hydroxychloroquine 
 <bold>(159)</bold> to pharmacologically active compound (

 <xref rid="B251" ref-type="bibr">Spaldin et al., 1994</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">Furst, 1996</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B220" ref-type="bibr">Projean, 2003b</xref>) CYP3A4 is responsible for the metabolism of Dexamethasone (DEX) 
 <bold>(166)</bold> to 6-hydroxyDEX (6OH-DEX) 
 <bold>(167)</bold> (
 <xref rid="B262" ref-type="bibr">Tomlinson et al., 1997</xref>). Remdesivir 
 <bold>(162)</bold> metabolism is mediated by hydrolases, however, it has been shown to exert weak inhibitory effects on CYP3A4, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, bile acid export pump, multidrug resistance-associated protein (
 <xref rid="B240" ref-type="bibr">Sciences, 2020</xref>), and sodium-taurocholate cotransporter protein. It is also established that remdesivir 
 <bold>(162)</bold> is a substrate of CYP2C8, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, bile acid export pump, multidrug resistance-associated protein (
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">European Medicines Agency, 2020</xref>), and sodium-taurocholate cotransporter protein. Lopinavir and ritonavir 
 <bold>(165)</bold> therapy strongly induces CYP2C19 activity and mildly induces CYP1A2 and CYP2C9. Both intestinal and hepatic CYP3A are inhibited by lopinavir and ritonavir therapy, the former being greatly affected (
 <xref rid="B285" ref-type="bibr">Yeh et al., 2006</xref>). The metabolism of favipiravir 
 <bold>(163)</bold> is mediated by aldehyde oxidase (AO) and xanthine oxidase in the hepatocyte cytosol, and not by CYP450 enzymes. But there are reports which support favipiravir 
 <bold>(163)</bold> as an inhibitor of CYP2C8 (
 <xref rid="B163" ref-type="bibr">Madelain et al., 2016</xref>).
