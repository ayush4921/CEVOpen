<p>Diverse plants, with their isolated products and derivatives with antiviral properties including alkaloids, flavonoids, phenolic compounds, terpenes, polysaccharides and polypeptides (

 <xref rid="B170" ref-type="bibr">Maroyi 2014</xref>). As natureâ€™s 
 <italic>biological</italic> laboratories containing hundreds and thousands of bioactive metabolites, African medicinal plants abundantly accumulate phytochemical markers and defense compounds of chemotaxonomic significance in different plant families (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). This variation in bioactive chemical markers in different plants has facilitated and justified the use of some plants in some families more often than others following their superior efficacy for conditions they are meant to treat in Traditional African Medicine (TAM) including viral outbreaks. Plant families which accumulate antiviral classes of compounds have been summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>. The antiviral properties and immuno-modulatory activities of these compounds can be utilized in the prevention, treatment and management of COVID-19, which till date awaits effective, safe, affordable and accessible treatment options. The efficacy of some plants and derived phytochemicals of African origin have been established following their potential to interfere with the replication and transcription machinery of some causative agents of viral infections (
 <xref rid="B177" ref-type="bibr">Mehrbod et al., 2018a</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B178" ref-type="bibr">Mehrbod et al., 2019</xref>). Documented antiviral potency of these medicinal plant extracts justifies their selection for further studies as potential agents for prophylactic administration or potential therapeutic intervention against COVID-19. However, an in-depth and rigorous analysis of their efficacy and safety using internationally acceptable protocols is germane during clinical trials prior to healthcare utilization.
