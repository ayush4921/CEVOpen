<p>In a study demonstrating the antiviral activity of Ethiopian medicinal plants against both HIV-1 and HIV- 2, the methanol fraction obtained from the root bark of 
 <italic>Bersama abyssinica</italic> Fresen. (Francoaceae) and the leaves of 
 <italic>Combretum paniculatum</italic> Vent (Combretaceae) at median effective concentrations (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) of 3.1 and 5.2 μg/ml were the most potent in inhibiting the replication of HIV-1 having a selective index of 3.8 and 6.4, respectively [
 <bold>Level V</bold>]. The extracts obtained from the leaves of 
 <italic>Dodonaea viscosa subsp. angustifolia</italic> (L.f.) J. G. West (Sapindaceae) and the stem bark of 
 <italic>Ximenia americana</italic> L. (Olacaceae) were found to be slightly active against HIV-1 with EC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 8.3 to 27.7 μg/ml and selectivity indices that ranged from 3.9 to 4.9. The acetone fraction of 
 <italic>C. paniculatum</italic> displayed an inhibitory potential against HIV-2 with a relatively high selectivity index of 32 at an EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 3.0 μg/ml while demonstrating moderate activity against HIV-1 with EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 15 and selectivity index of 6.4. Also, the replication in HIV-2 was altered by hydroalcohol fraction of 
 <italic>X. americana</italic> at EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 27.1 μg/ml (

 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies would suggest potential benefits of clinical relevance.
