<p>A positive aspect of the use of herb-based preparations in pharmacotherapy is the observation that the derivable pharmacological benefits often emanate from multiple constituent natural products that are sufficiently structurally diverse and yet related to permit the modulation of varied and yet related biochemical processes. It is crucial to point out that the anti-coronavirus activities identified for these natural products were obtained by 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments often involving enzyme-based inhibition assays against isolated viral enzymes. In the absence of biological membranes and the complexity associated within vivo systems, pharmacokinetics is thus unlikely to constitute any real challenge. On the other hand, had these natural products or their multi-component herbal preparations been tested in 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> situations, they might have been thought to lack the anti-coronavirus activities with which they have been credited. Pharmacokinetic factors and experimental design are thus crucial considerations in the identification of potent anti-SARS-CoV2 herb-based products, and it is recommended that testing should in the first stages employ enzyme-based assays while physicochemical/pharmacokinetic liabilities can later be remedied by employing appropriate formulation techniques.
