<p>Generally, most of the drugs used in humans are metabolized by a class of enzymes known as cytochrome P450 (CYP) (
 <xref rid="B260" ref-type="bibr">Thomford et al., 2016</xref>). The CYP enzyme comprises diverse isoenzymes whose function can be altered by phytochemicals present in phytomedicines. In herb-drug interaction, the herbal drug may induce or inhibit the same isoenzyme that is responsible for the metabolism of the synthetic drug. If the co-administered herbal drug inhibits the isoenzyme, the synthetic drug will not be metabolized; this will lead to high levels of the drug in physiological fluid which consequently results in toxicity. In contrast, if the herbal drug induces the isoenzyme, this could result in rapid metabolism of the drug whose optimal therapeutic concentration in systemic circulation may not be reached leading to treatment failure, and possibly development of resistance (

 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have shown that CYP3A4, 3A5 and CYP19 enzymes are inhibited by hypoxoside, an active component of 
 <italic>Hypoxis hemerocallidea</italic> Fisch., C.A. Mey. and Avé-Lall. (Hypoxidaceae); 
 <italic>Hyptis suaveolens</italic> (L.). Poit. (Lamiaceae), 
 <italic>Boerhavia diffusa</italic> L (Nyctaginacea), 
 <italic>Launaea taraxacifolia</italic> (Willd.) Amin ex C. Jeffrey (Asteraceae) and 
 <italic>Myrothamnus flabellifolia</italic> Welw. (Myrothamnaceae) inhibit CYP2B6 activity in a concentration -dependent manner. 
 <italic>Sutherlandia frutescens</italic> (L.) R.Br. (Fabaceae) was shown to inhibit CYP3A4. In other words, the drugs metabolized by these enzymes will become toxic if administered concurrently with these plants commonly used in African Traditional medicine. On cultured cells, 
 <italic>Agarista salicifolia</italic> (Lam.) G.Don (Ericacea), 
 <italic>Turraea holstii</italic> Gürke (Meliaceae) and 
 <italic>Sterculia africana</italic> (Lour.) Fiori (Malvacea) causes more than two-fold induction of CYP3A4 mRNA (
 <xref rid="B184" ref-type="bibr">Mills et al., 2005</xref>). Unfortunately, only limited data exist in Africa regarding 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> herb-drug interaction since most patients do not report intake of herbal medicines to health practitioners during treatment. Yet one common practice in Sub Saharan Africa is the prescription of antimicrobials and the parallel consumption of widely used traditional medicines which are potentially harmful to the liver (
