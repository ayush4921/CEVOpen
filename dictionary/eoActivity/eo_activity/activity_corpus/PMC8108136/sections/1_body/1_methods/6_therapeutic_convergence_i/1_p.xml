<p>Antimalarial drugs derived from medicinal plants used in Traditional African Medicine have been found useful as repurposed drugs in managing other diseases including viral infections such as HIV, Ebola, and other viral hemorrhagic diseases due to lack of effective therapeutic agents. The active constituents of these plants have various mechanisms of action which are often not fully elucidated against malaria parasites. The complexity of these constituents sometimes lead to side effects that have been studied for repurposing them for the treatment of other conditions such as non-malaria infectious diseases (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Das, 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">Haładyj et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B276" ref-type="bibr">Wolf et al., 2006</xref>). The geographical distribution between malaria and viral diseases where malaria endemic regions of the world such as Africa and Asia appear to experience relatively low cases of COVID-19-related mortalities led to the consideration of a possible therapeutic convergence between antimalarial plants (which have continued to be used against malaria in Africa) and viral pathogens including the dreaded SARS CoV-2. One possible explanation attributable to this unresolved therapeutic convergence is the mechanism of activity of these medicinal plants; several antimalarial phytomedicines which tend to produce more bioactivity as antioxidants, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory may function both as antimalarials and antiviral since the underlying mechanism of activity is not directly targeting the pathogen but rather boosting the immunity of the host, effective and efficient resolution of early inflammatory/anti-inflammatory cytokines (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Afolayan et al., 2020</xref>) and scavenging of generated lethal free radicals (
 <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">Iheagwam et al., 2020</xref>). This school of thought has been put forward to explain why many widely used African phytomedicines have gained more anecdotal claims of efficacy yet they do not easily kill the malaria parasite 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> but produce good 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> activity. For instance, 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Adebayo et al. (2017)</xref> demonstrated the poor 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> but potent 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> antimalarial activity of disulphide-rich peptide fraction of 
 <italic>Morinda lucida</italic> (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Adebayo et al., 2017</xref>)
 <italic>.</italic> These antimicrobial peptides have been reported to possess immunostimulating and antioxidant activities (
 <xref rid="B197" ref-type="bibr">Nguyen et al., 2016</xref>) as well as antiviral property (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Boas et al., 2019</xref>). Apparently, the lethal COVID-19 is reported to be induced by the invasion of SARS CoV-2 into a human host and has been associated with cytokine storm (
 <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr">Jose and Manuel, 2020</xref>) and neutrophil-induced oxidative stress (
 <xref rid="B144" ref-type="bibr">Laforge et al., 2020</xref>) which often result in mortality. So, it is reasonable to assume that antimalarial plants widely used in TAM with well documented 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory potentials might offer some therapeutic benefits in COVID-19 management. A treatize of antimalarial plants used in TAM with documented antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities as well as level of documented evidence has been presented in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s7">Supplementary Table S1</xref>. However, the authorization of the repurposed use of these botanical antimalarials should be evidence-informed with impressive clinical data and supported by the best evidence. Considering repurposing antimalarial African traditional phytomedicines for COVID-19 management, endemic and naturalized African plants which have shown therapeutic promise as antimalarials following clinical studies should be considered and these include 
 <italic>Vernonia amygdalina</italic>, 
 <italic>Nuclea pobeguinii</italic> (Pobéguin ex Pellegr.) Petit, 
 <italic>Argemone mexicana</italic> L.
 <italic>, Artemisia annua</italic> L.

 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Aracil and Green, 2019</xref>) and 
 <italic>Morinda lucida</italic> Benth (Rubiaceae). Interestingly, available evidence indicates that these promising antimalarial plants additionally have the potential to tackle oxidative stress, regulate inflammatory response and stimulate the immune system to overcome complications observed in COVID-19 [
