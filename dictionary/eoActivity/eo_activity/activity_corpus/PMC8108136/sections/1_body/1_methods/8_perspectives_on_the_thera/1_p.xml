<p>Africans may lack access to western repurposed drugs that are now used to manage COVID-19 in developed countries, but they have unlimited access to medicinal plants which can be standardized for effective and safe use. These tropical plants accumulate both primary and secondary metabolites with a broad range of 
 <italic>in silico</italic>, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> activities including antiviral properties

 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref>–
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Many of the antiviral primary metabolites such as polysaccharides and antiviral proteins (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) accumulated in African plants reported in this review have not attracted much research attention and exploitation in antiviral drug discovery. Even of more scientific interest are the highly stable low molecular weight peptides known as cysteine-knot peptides among which, cyclotides (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>; 1–7) are most stable due to their continuous circular configuration, low molecular weight, abundance, sequence variability, oral bioavailability, target specificity, low 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> toxicity and wide distribution in plants families including Violaceae, Rubiaceae, Fabaceae, Curcubitaceae and Solanaceae (

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Attah et al., 2016b</xref>;

 <xref rid="B270" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Antiviral Kalata B1 and B8 have been isolated from an indigenous plant 
 <italic>Oldenlandia affinis</italic> (Roem. and Schult.) DC. (Rubiaceae) used in Traditional African Medicine to aid delivery in Central Africa (
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">Gran et al., 2000</xref>) and as an antimalarial herb in Nigeria (
 <xref rid="B200" ref-type="bibr">Nworu et al., 2017</xref>); cyclotide-rich aqueous extract of 
 <italic>Oldenlandia affinis</italic> DC. represent a potential multitarget peptide drug candidate that awaits scientific investigation against COVID-19. However, phytomedicines containing antiviral Kalata B1 may be contraindicated in pregnancy (
 <xref rid="B234" ref-type="bibr">Saether et al., 1995</xref>) and more useful during the late stage of hyper-inflammation observed in COVID-19 owing to the immunosuppressant activity of Kalata B1 (
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">Gründemann et al., 2013</xref>). Meanwhile, the therapeutic potentials of these peptides still lacks clinical evidence to support the interesting 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> findings.
