<p>A typical medicinal plant is a biological factory of a plethora of complex bioactive metabolites and most of the phytomedicines used in TAM are polyherbal with potential multiple targets in host and/or pathogen structure. Expectedly, complex phytotherapeutics which target both the pathogen as well as the host structure required for infection of viruses without a significant cytotoxicity to the host, could represent an alternative way to develop new and effective antiviral phytotherapies (

Bioactive protein hydrolysates and cysteine-rich polypeptides target viral membrane and proteins, alkaloids and glycosides target viral proteins and RNA, terpenes target viral membrane while steroids and flavonoids target viral RNA synthesis (

For instance, the interaction between the spike glycoproteins of SARS COV-2 and the host cell angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors which leads to viral attachment and entry, culminating in COVID-19 could be prevented or blocked effectively [
