<p>In this review, a literature search was carried out and popular scientific databases including PubMed, PubChem, Google Scholar, HINARI; these were searched to retrieve scientific peer-reviewed publications on African traditional medicinal plants with antiviral potentials. Considering the framework of unveiling the role played by antiviral plants commonly used in Traditional African Medicine (TAM) in tackling deadly infectious diseases such as COVID 19, the traditional uses, bioactive metabolites, in silico, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, and clinical studies as well as the sustainable use of these plants in African ethnomedicine and associated challenges were considered and included. Articles published in English before July 2020 using the keywords; “Africa”, “antiviral plants”, “SARS COV”, “COVID-19”, “antiviral phytomedicines”, “Traditional African Medicine”, “herbal immuno-stimulants”, “herb-drug interaction” were subsequently retrieved. Generally accepted and popular anecdotal claims on plant-based COVID-19 treatment options have also been included wherever appropriate. Excluded from this review were studies carried out on plants not found in Africa, repetitive studies and publications that have failed to meet the inclusion criteria. Following the minimal impact of the much earlier outbreaks of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) epidemics on the African continent, SARS and MERS have not attracted a significant TAM-related research attention; and therefore are not a focus of this review.
