<p>A recent CADD-directed fluorogenic enzyme inhibition assay reported corilagin and rhoifolin, two natural products of African origin, with micromolar range inhibitory activity against the main protease (3CLpro) enzyme of the SARS-CoV2 (
 <xref rid="B160" ref-type="bibr">Loschwitz et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, the investigation which had commenced with the screening of an over 1.2 million virtual compound library (
 <xref rid="B206" ref-type="bibr">Olubiyi et al., 2020</xref>) identified corilagin and rhoifolin in the top eight compounds with respect to main protease inhibitory activity. Corilagin, an ellagitannin, is widely distributed in several African plants and is known to be present in the plant families including Euphorbiaceae (e.g. 
 <italic>Acalypha wilkesiania</italic> Muell Arg and 
 <italic>Acalypha australis</italic> L., 
 <italic>Euphorbia longana</italic> Lam., 
 <italic>Phyllanthus emblica</italic> L., 
 <italic>P. urinaria</italic> L., 
 <italic>P. tenellus</italic> Roxb., 
 <italic>P. niruri</italic> L., etc), Geraniaceae (
 <italic>Geranium sibiricum</italic> L.), Combretaceae (
 <italic>Terminalia catappa</italic> L.), to mention a few. Rhoifolin on the other hand is a tri-substituted flavone and has been reported in 
 <italic>Uraria picta</italic> (Jacq.) DC, a perennial tropical plant with distribution extending through most parts of Sub-Saharan Africa. With 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> inhibitory activities of both natural products in the micromolar range, it is yet to be determined if the reported potencies will extend to 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> situations. But the establishment of the SARS-CoV2 3CLpro inhibitory activities for both natural products further support the potential of African plants to potentially furnish herb-based remedies and lead compounds that can be developed into clinically useful treatment for COVID-19 [
