<p>Traditional African Medicines of the D. R. Congo and Nigeria have developed 
 <italic>N. pobeguinii</italic> and 
 <italic>N. latifolia</italic> for clinical application in malaria therapy which may form a starting point for herbal repurposing for COVID-19 management. For instance, a diherbal preparation containing 
 <italic>N. latifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>Cassia occidentalis</italic> (Manalaria
 <sup>®</sup>), was authorized for malaria treatment in D.R. Congo which later formed part of the Congolese List of Essential Drugs (

 <italic>N. pobeguinii</italic> (codenamed PR 259 CT1) was successfully taken through preclinical investigation and phase 1 of clinical trials [

 <italic>N. latifolia</italic> otherwise known as NIPRD AM1
 <sup>®</sup>, has been clinically studied in uncomplicated malaria and found to be therapeutically helpful as an antimalarial (

 <bold>Level I</bold>, for malaria]. Nevertheless, such investigation should follow after these chemically complex herbal mixtures have been taken through extensive acute, subacute and chronic toxicity studies as well as the metabolite profiling using modern analytical methods.
