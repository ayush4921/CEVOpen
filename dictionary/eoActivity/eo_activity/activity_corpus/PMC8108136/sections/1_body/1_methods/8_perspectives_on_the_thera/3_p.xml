<p>Since the global R and D community is relentlessly working on getting an effective treatment to stop the COVID-19 pandemic, symptomatic management of the viral symptoms and Prevention of infection through divergent approaches should be encouraged. For instance, evidence-based and documented scientific publications on the antiviral and immunomodulatory potentials of African plants could provide some clues on prevention and management of COVID-19. Examples of such African plants widely used in traditional medicine across the region which have received

Some commonly used Nigerian medicinal plants that may have potentials for the symptomatic management of COVID-19 include
