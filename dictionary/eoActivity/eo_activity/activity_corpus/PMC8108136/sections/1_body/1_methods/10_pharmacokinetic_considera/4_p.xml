<p>Absorption and bioavailability profiling is challenging for herbal mixtures, partly because existing mathematical models can only suitably describe single drug molecules. The AUC and bioavailability for example, are referenced against measured systemic concentrations of individual drugs and can only describe one drug substance at a time. This however is not to downplay the importance of equivalent means of profiling herb-based preparations. In fact, many natural products are associated with deficient molecular properties compromising solubility, membrane permeation and thus absorption and bioavailability. This is however not surprising since the evolutionary process that emerged the natural products inside plants is isolated from processes within the human biological system where a fine balance of molecular features is often required for receptor interaction. Natural products present in plants have no such evolutionary imperative beyond the functions natively played in their host plants. Therefore, a good number of natural products with good 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> biological profiles have been reported with suboptimal physicochemical properties. Interestingly both the pharmacological potency and poor absorption properties of the component natural products are closely tied with their complex chemical structures. Polyphenols are a class of phytochemicals whose immunomodulatory properties can be useful in herbal preparations for COVID19. They are however often characterized by poor absorption and deactivation by gastric conditions (
