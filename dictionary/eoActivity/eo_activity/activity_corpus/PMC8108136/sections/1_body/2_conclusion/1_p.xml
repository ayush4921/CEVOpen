<p>In this review, several in silico, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and few 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies have revealed the therapeutic potential of plant-derived bioactive compounds for the treatment of viral infections in TAM, but the data are too preliminary to be adopted in clinical settings. We have shown clearly that available data are not sufficient to encourage the clinical use of TAM against viral infections, COVID-19 in this special case. Despite the huge potential of TAM, one big and notable gap in knowledge of antiviral application of TAM is the lack of well documented human studies with comparative data. This calls for more research effort geared toward the clinical application of TAM during viral epidemics. Among the primary and secondary metabolites documented, polysaccharides, lectins, cyclotides, alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins and terpenes have been widely exploited and studied for the treatment of several viral diseases and virtually tested for efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. However, only a few of these identified compounds such as KB1, KB8 and andrographolide have good scientific evidence; others require a more elaborate evidence while quite a few have evidence that are rather inconclusive or outright poor quality evidence. For instance, the cyclotide Kalata B1 and B8 from 
 <italic>O. affinis</italic> have been supported by a good evidence for antiviral (anti-HIV) as well as immunostimulating activities in addition to their well-documented oral bioavailability, target specificity, low toxicity, desirable stability in body fluid, mechanism of activity and the uterotonic potential of KB1. Homologues of these knottin peptide therapeutics have recently been identified in some endemic tropical African plants including 
 <italic>Rinorea dentata and Rinorea oblongifolia,</italic> thus expanding their natural sources 
 <italic>in planta</italic>.
