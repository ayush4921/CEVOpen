<p>The emergence of the deadly COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the extent of (over 85%) dependence of African populations on medicinal plants for primary healthcare needs. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), which is currently on a progressive pre-clinical and clinical standardization path, has proved to be effective during the outbreak of SARS-CoV and now SARS-CoV-2 as TCM has been well integrated to western medicines with outcomes supporting their continued use and integration. Africa can follow this same path to evidence-based application of indigenous phytomedicines in the prevention and treatment of viral diseases including COVID-19. Findings from this review indicates that extensive clinical studies are urgently needed to evaluate their therapeutic efficacy and adverse effects especially herb-drug interaction. Importantly, the identification of commercially available herbal medicines used in TAM as documented in this review, which have received an initial regulatory approval for use in humans, and active against viruses, might accelerate their repurposed considerations, observational applications, clinical trials and eventual clinical use, particularly during sudden outbreaks of highly pathogenic viruses like the SARS COV-2. However, future research should equally investigate their mechanism of activity in order to improve their formulation, antiviral activity and to reduce the risk of side effects.</p>
