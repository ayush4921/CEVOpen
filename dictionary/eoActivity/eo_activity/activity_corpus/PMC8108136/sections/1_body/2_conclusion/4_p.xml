<p>Phytomedicines used in Traditional African Medicines are most often sourced from the wild and less often cultivated, serves over 85% of the populations within the region, yet have not received utmost respect for good clinical practice (GCP) during the production process. Plants used in Traditional African Medicine are, until now substantially and unsustainably collected from the wild. The tropical forests, including the Sub-Saharan tropical African flora, which covers up to half of the world's angiospermic plants have been described to be in danger of a continuous decline at an estimated 16.8 million ha/annum (
 <xref rid="B222" ref-type="bibr">Purvis et al., 2019</xref>). This riotous and unabated competition for the unsustainable depletion of plant resource in Africa which are most often collected for medicinal and non-medicinal purposes constitutes a threat to plant biodiversity and their availability to future generations. Thus, the sustainable use of medicinal plant resource in Africa should encourage their purpose-driven cultivation for use in African ethnomedicine as well as for production of evidence-led phytomedicines. In addition, the establishment of requisite programs for medicinal plant resource utilization and conservation of endemic African plants are opportunities for future studies. This has become urgent as plant cultivation offers pharmacological advantages over collection from the wild due to variation in quality and composition resulting from environmental and genomic mutations (
 <xref rid="B273" ref-type="bibr">WHO et al., 1993</xref>). Furthermore, cultivated plants reduces the possibility for variation in addition to the unlikely event of getting the therapeutic benefit. More so, the sustainable use of plants via cultivation has the potential of reducing the likelihood of adulteration and wrong identification. The efficacy and toxicity assessment of phytomedicines used in Africa for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 is urgently needed to justify or discourage their local uses. According to WHO Africa
 <italic>,</italic> “
 <italic>even if therapies are derived from traditional practice and natural, establishing their efficacy and safety through rigorous clinical trials is critical</italic>”. Therefore, future research should focus on an indepth scientific investigation to demystify the bioactive component and establish chemical fingerprint for such complex herbal phytomedicines and mechanistically study them for an evidence-rooted and verifiable plant-derived medicines with potential for COVID 19 management. Consequently, the integration of Traditional African Medicine into the western-based national healthcare structure and clinical study of potential herb-drug interaction are research outlook for consideration by research institutions in Africa and the government of African countries.
