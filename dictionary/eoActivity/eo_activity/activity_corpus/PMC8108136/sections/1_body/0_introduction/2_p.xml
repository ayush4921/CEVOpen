<p>Despite all the divergent efforts to halt the spread and mortalities associated with COVID-19, the devastating micro-enemy has continued to spread causing more deaths and a lot of socio-economic implications.

Following the reported success with the use of herbal adjuvants during the previous outbreaks of viral infections in China, the outbreak of SARS-CoV2 received an immediate authorization of integral Traditional Chineseâ€“Western medicines to treat COVID-19 (
