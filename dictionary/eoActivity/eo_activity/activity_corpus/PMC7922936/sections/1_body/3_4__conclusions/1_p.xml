<p>Numerous pump inhibitors that have been produced (E.G. verapamil) are characterized by significant toxicities that reduce their use in therapy. 
 <italic>E. intisy</italic> EO seems to have several potentialities with a very low toxicity. Our results suggest that 
 <italic>E. intisy</italic> EO might; (i) be a stimulator of ATP-dependent drug efflux transporter; (ii) act as substrate for transport by P-gp that stimulates P-gp ATPase activity; (iii) lead to the inhibition of P-gp efflux function; (iv) reduce the expression of P-gp through NF-ÎºB modulation. In fact, even though EO has a low effect on cell death, its multiple actions on P-gp enhance the antitumor effects of doxorubicin. EOs could be active in several types of cancer but their mechanism of action is complex due to the presence of several secondary metabolites. Further studies are planned to investigate the putative compounds involved in P-gp modulation among the most abundant in 
 <italic>E. intisy</italic> EO. These compounds, or the whole EO, could be used as an adjuvant in anticancer therapy to overcome multidrug resistance. Further investigations are needed to study the pharmacokinetics of the EO.
