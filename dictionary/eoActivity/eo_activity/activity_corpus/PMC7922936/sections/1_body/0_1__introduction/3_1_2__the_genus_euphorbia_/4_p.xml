<p>For all previously made assumptions we used a multidrug resistance leukemia model obtained by us by exposure of the sensitive cell line HL-60 with increasing doses of doxorubicin, characterized by overexpression of P-gp, inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) and constitutive expression of the transcription factor NF-ÎºB, to assess whether the EO extracted from
