<p>Previous works demonstrated that essential oils (EOs), from succulent plants, have antitumor activities on different types of tumors such as triple negative breast cancer and acute myeloid leukemia all characterized by scarce responsiveness to chemotherapeutic drugs [

 <xref rid="B7-pharmaceuticals-14-00111" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The biological effects showed that the EOs extracted by the hydrodistillation of leaves seem to be due to the presence of terpene compounds such as phytol. A recent analysis suggests that we must diversify the species we utilize and/or substitute towards those better adapted to future climate [

Varying sources of bioactive compounds with drought-tolerant species appears to be a convenient option in drug discovery, as it links the usefulness with the resilience. Furthermore, pharmacological investigations on their medicinal properties are promising for several contemporary diseases [
