<p>In order to evaluate the effects of 
 <italic>E. intisy</italic> EO on intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin in HL-60R cell line, the cells were cultured in 24-well plates at a density of 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells per well. After 24 h, the cells were treated with 
 <italic>E. intisy</italic> EO 15 μg/mL or verapamil 10 μM. After 24 h of incubation doxorubicin 1 μg/mL has been added for different time: 30min, 1h and 2h. Subsequently, the cells were washed twice with PBS and then resuspended in 400 μL PBS for doxorubicin fluorescence intensity measurement by flow cytometry using a FACSAria III instrument (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA, USA). The results are presented as percentage of fluorescence intensity relative to control (means ± SE of three experiments).
