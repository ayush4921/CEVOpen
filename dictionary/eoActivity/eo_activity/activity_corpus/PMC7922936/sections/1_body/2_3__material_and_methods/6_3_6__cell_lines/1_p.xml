<p>The HL-60 cells were obtained from ATCC® (CCL-240, Rockville, MD, USA), while its variant HL-60R were cultured as previously described [
 <xref rid="B6-pharmaceuticals-14-00111" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Caco-2 cells was kindly provided by Professor Mario Allegra (Department of Biological, Chemical and Pharmaceutical Science and Technology, University of Palermo, Italy). HL-60 and HL-60R cells were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640, while Caco-2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (HyClone Europe Ltd., Cramlington, UK) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 units /mL penicillin and 100 µg/mL streptomycin (all reagents were from HyClone Europe Ltd., Cramlington, UK) in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Caco-2 cells were treated 15 days after confluence, at which time the cells are differentiated in normal intestinal-like cells.
