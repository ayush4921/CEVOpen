<p>For years, plant-based remedies have been used as a traditional practice to treat and prevent a broad range of diseases. During the past decade, natural therapies have regained public attention, and, to date, great interest has caught on, as demonstrated by the elevated number of new studies concerning this topic, and by the high funds earmarked every year on medicinal plants. Several reasons contribute to this renovated attention on herbal remedies, among which we can include: the prospect to study a high quantity of unexplored botanicals species; an eco-friendly and cost-efficient approach in terms of research, isolation, and production; the possibility to discover new antimicrobial natural products, that can face the current spreading of antibiotic resistance; the demanding need to reveal potential side effects and interactions of the most widely used natural products with concomitant drug therapies.</p>
