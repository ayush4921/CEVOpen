<p>Cordeiro et al. studied the antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects of 
 <italic>Stevia serrata</italic> Cav. (Asteraceae) essential oil (EO) and the mechanism of action using opioid and cholinergic antagonists (naloxone and atropine, respectively) and the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (N-omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, L-NAME).Their work suggests that essential oil of 
 <italic>S. serrata</italic> presents an antinociceptive effect mediated, at least in part, through activation of opioid, cholinergic and nitrergic pathways [

 <italic>Orthosiphon stamineus</italic> is a traditional remedy that possesses anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and free-radical scavenging abilities, all of which are known to protect against Alzheimer’s disease (AD). With their research, Retinasamy et al. demonstrated an improved effect of 
 <italic>O. stamineus</italic> ethanolic extract on memory in rat, and hence, could serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD [

Terpenoids are natural plant-derived products that are used to treat a broad range of human diseases, including airway infections and inflammation. However, pharmaceutical applications of terpenoids against bacterial infection remain challenging due to their poor water solubility. Kaltschmidt et al. perfectioned the preparation of terpenoid-invasomes with selective activity against 
 <italic>S. Aureus</italic>. They also performed characterization by cryo-transmission electron microscopyand demonstrated that, particularly thymol-invasomes, show a strong selective activity against Gram-positive bacteria [

 <italic>Aristolochia trilobata</italic> and its main ingredient the sulcatyl acetate (SA), they studied the mechanism of antinociceptive activity being evaluated in presence of opioid, cholinergic receptor antagonists (naloxone and atropine), or nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (L-NAME). EO and SA present peripheral and central antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects, mediated by inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and spleen tyrosine kinases (Syk) expression [

 <italic>β</italic>-Caryophyllene (BCP), a cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) agonist, in an in vitro model of oral mucositis, exploring the human gingival fibroblasts (GF), and human oral mucosa epithelial cells (EC) with an inflammatory phenotype representing a valuable experimental paradigm. BCP blunted the lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced inflammatory phenotype and this effect was reverted by the CB2 antagonist AM630. These results suggest that CB2 receptors are an interesting target to develop innovative strategies for oral mucositis [

Ikarashi et al., starting from previously data that suggest an inhibitory effect byergosterol on bladder carcinogenesis, elucidated its molecular mechanism using a rat model of N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)-nitrosamine-induced bladder cancer. They also analyzed various aspects of the cell cycle, inflammation-related signaling, and androgen signaling, suggesting that ergosterol inhibits bladder carcinogenesis [

 <italic>H. aspersa</italic>, 
 <italic>H. lucorum,</italic> and 
 <italic>R. venosa</italic>, as well as the mucus from 
 <italic>H. aspersa</italic> exert an antitumor activity in vitro against colorectal carcinoma cell line HT-29, reducing cell viability with a mechanism that includes the induction of apoptosis [

Ashrafizadeh et al. reviewed the therapeutic effects of resveratrol, shading light on its possible impact on the tumor growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling pathway. Interestingly, resveratrol inhibits both upstream (such as microRNAs (miR)) and downstream mediators of TGF-beta signaling (small mother against decapentaplegic (SMAD), programmed cell death protein 1 (known asPD-1) andepithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT)). Via the down regulation of this pathway, resveratrol exerts its anti-fibrotic, anti-tumor, neuroprotective, lung protective, and anti-diabetics effects [

Rahman et al. analyzed the role of natural compounds in the modulation of autophagy pathway in cancer prevention and treatment, neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) are the leading regulatory path way of autophagy and they are known targets for natural compounds such as resveratrol, curcumin, antroquinonol and many others [

 <italic>Centellaasiatica</italic> and 
 <italic>Curcumalonga</italic> on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in prefrontal cortex of adult rats. The phytosome ameliorates brain plasticity, enhancing mTOR-S6 regulated transcription of proteins involved in memory processes, suggesting that this preparation can be used as a supporting therapy in subjects with memory and cognitive disfunction [

This review highlighted that WA is a promising anticancer compound, but its benefits include also AD, cardioprotective, neuroprotective, osteoporotic, and antiviral effects. Moreover, according to pharmacokinetics studies, it can be used to design drug delivery systems [

The results show that kahweol inhibits immune cell accumulation presumably through down regulation of vascular adhesion molecules, suggesting that it can be a potential preventive agent against cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury, enabling the use of a high dose of cisplatin [

Rapa et al. evaluated the effect of plumericin to improve intestinal epithelial barrier function both in intestinal epithelial cells in vitro, and in vivo in a model of dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS) induced colitis. This study provided evidence that plumericin improves the expression of junctions’ proteins in the epithelial cells, reducing also apoptotic parameters, and enhancing actin cytoskeleton rearrangement. In vivo experiments sustain this evidence, thus supporting the pharmacological potential of plumericin as an adjuvant in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) [
