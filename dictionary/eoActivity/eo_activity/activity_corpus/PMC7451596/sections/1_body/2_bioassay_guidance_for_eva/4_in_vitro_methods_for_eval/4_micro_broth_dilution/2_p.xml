<p id="p0520">Small amounts of samples are required when evaluating the activities of natural products in 96-well microplates. This technique offers advantages, such as reduced cost, good overall production and automated process. The mycobacterial organism is usually cultured in Middlebrook 7H9 broth with the addition of 0.5% glycerol, 0.1% casitone, 0.05% Tween-80 and ADC (10%). The quantitative evaluation of many mycobacterial strains in liquid medium based on turbidity caused by clumping behaviour is difficult (

The reduction of alamarBlue can be estimated by using a colorimeter and then subtracting the absorption measured at 600 nm from that measured at 570 nm. The microbroth dilution technique can be applied by using either resazurin or tetrazolium dye to obtain results with increased sensitivity (

Hence, the results for partial inhibition can be obtained via high-throughput anti-TB assays by using a microplate spectrophotometer or fluorometer, making these methods perfect for determining the various activities of crude natural products at different concentrations (
