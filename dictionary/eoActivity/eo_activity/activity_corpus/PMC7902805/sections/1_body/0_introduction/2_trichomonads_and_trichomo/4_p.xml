 <italic>T. vaginalis.</italic> Trichomoniasis is the most common non-viral sexually transmitted urogenital infection that affects both men and women. Caused by flagellated protozoan parasite 
 <italic>Trichomonas vaginalis</italic>, it mainly affects women's vagina, showing clinical symptoms like vaginal discharge, often yellow or green, vulvovaginal irritation, and dysuria. Men with trichomoniasis may not show any clinical signs; however, the urethra is the most common infection site, causing urethral irritation, discharge, or mild burning after urination or ejaculation and swelling of the prostate gland (

 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> parasite existing only in trophozoite form that uses adhesion proteins to bind to squamous epithelial cells. Soluble and membrane-associated enzymes having phospholipase A activity cause lysis of nucleated cells, resulting in microulcerations and microscopic hemorrhages of the vaginal wall and exocervix. Although humoral and cell-mediated immune-inflammatory responses are generated, repeated, and persistent infection occurs, indicating non-protective immunity (
