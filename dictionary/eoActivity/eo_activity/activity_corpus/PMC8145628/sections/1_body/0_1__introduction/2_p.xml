<p>A large number of anti-pain drugs for inflammatory and neuropathic conditions have been developed and fully tested in clinical studies [

 <xref rid="B8-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The currently pharmacological treatment is usually classified according to the class of pain; moreover, some combinations have been probed to create a synergistic analgesic effect and reduce side effects exhibited by anti-pain drugs [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In this regard, NSAIDs such as naproxen, ibuprofen, ketorolac, and some selective COX-2 inhibitors, have side effects on the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hepatic, and renal systems [
 <xref rid="B9-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. On the other hand, many efforts have been made to prescribe an adequate algorithm for chronic pain treatment. Despite these efforts, the central treatment is focused on opioid pharmacotherapies. Unfortunately, long-term exposure to opioids produces constipation, addictive behavior, tolerance development, and can be a fatal outcome [
 <xref rid="B10-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Moreover, the use of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) such as amitriptyline and likewise serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) such as duloxetine and venlafaxine have been associated with somnolence, constipation, dry mouth, and nausea [
 <xref rid="B11-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Furthermore, clinical studies have demonstrated that the prescription of gabapentin or pregabalin is related to somnolence, dizziness, and weight gain; whereas the topical use of lidocaine and capsaicin patches is associated with irritation and local pain [
 <xref rid="B12-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Historically, the wide distribution, use, and acceptance of medicinal plants have been documented in all the regions of Mexico [

 <xref rid="B18-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In a study carried by Alonso-Castro et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], 28% and 26% of health professionals and physicians, respectively, accepted that they have recommended or prescribed medicinal plants to treat several diseases in their patients. Historically and now, members of the general population have suggested that natural compounds are harmless to the human organism. Because of this, natural products have been used as substitutes for the use of synthetic chemical compounds [
 <xref rid="B19-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, this is a misconception. It is important to understand that some plants and their derivates might produce side and adverse effects, as well as toxicity and death [
 <xref rid="B20-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In our opinion, the current exploration of the chemical composition, toxicology, dosage, and ethnopharmacology of Mexican herbalism is an urgent area of study for the rational use of traditional medicine. In this respect, there are extensive summaries about the ethnopharmacology of Mexican traditional plants and their derivates, which are popularly employed to treat the most common afflictions. Antibacterial [

 <xref rid="B22-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], antidiabetic [
 <xref rid="B23-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] anxiolytic or antidepressant [

 <xref rid="B25-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], anti-cancer [

 <xref rid="B27-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and cardiovascular [
 <xref rid="B28-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] effects exhibited by Mexican herbalism products have been demonstrated in preclinical studies. On the other hand, the use of medicinal plants to treat headaches, rheumatic pain, and chronic pain conditions has been documented in Mexican culture [
 <xref rid="B29-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In this field, there has not been a review of the anti-pain properties of these plants, focusing on the mechanism of actions and adverse effects produced by the most consumed plants in the Mexican population. Accordingly, we propose an extensive review of the preclinical evidence of Mexican medicinal plants and derivative compounds used for inflammatory and neuropathic pain treatment, as well as their main mechanisms of action and reported adverse effects.
