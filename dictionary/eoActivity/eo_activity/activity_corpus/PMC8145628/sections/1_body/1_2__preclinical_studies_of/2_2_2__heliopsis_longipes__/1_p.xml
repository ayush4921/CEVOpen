 <italic>Heliopsis longipes</italic> from 
 <italic>Asteraceae</italic> family, is a native plant from Sierra de Álvarez and Sierra Gorda in Mexico [
 <xref rid="B36-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Its roots have been used in the Mexican culture for treatment of toothache [
 <xref rid="B37-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and as insecticide [
 <xref rid="B38-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The antinociceptive properties of affinin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00865-f001">Figure 1</xref>) and 
 <italic>H. longipes</italic> were demonstrated have been several inflammatory pain models in rodents [
 <xref rid="B39-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Six preclinical assays in mice have documented the antinociceptive behavior produced by the administration of 
 <italic>Heliopsis longipes</italic> or affinin. Concomitantly, experimental assays on brain slices of mice demonstrated that affinin induced the release of GABA [
 <xref rid="B42-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In agreement with these results, Déciga-Campos et al. [
 <xref rid="B43-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] demonstrated that activation of the GABAergic system, as well as nitric oxide, K
 <sup>+</sup> channels, and the opioid and serotonergic systems are responsible for the antinociceptive effects of 
 <italic>H. longipes</italic> and affinin. Moreover, researhcers have also observed the activation of TRPV1 as a mechanism of action of affinin in an inflammatory pain model [
 <xref rid="B44-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Affinin has been described as a stimulant of the nervous system and, paradoxically, has a function as a depressant. Mice submitted to Irwin’s test showed an increased activity and decreased reaction to touch and noise after administration of 1 mg/kg affinin [
 <xref rid="B45-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Moreover, in vitro studies demonstrated the inhibitory effects of 
 <italic>H. longipes</italic> and its main derivate compound, affinin, on CYP3A4, CYP2D6 and CYP1A1/2 [
 <xref rid="B46-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. These studies demonstrate that 
 <italic>H. longipes</italic> inhibits the major CYP 450 enzymes involved in the metabolism of 80% of market drugs. Therefore, the ingestion of 
 <italic>H. longipes</italic> in combination with other drugs
 <italic>,</italic> is likely to increase the concentration of the administrated drugs and subsequently increase the risk of herbal–drug interactions, with adverse clinical consequences.
