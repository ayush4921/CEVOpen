 <xref rid="B86-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Flower infusions are the most common form of ingestion of this plant. Its distribution is wide, from Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas to Oaxaca state, with a marked predominance in Michoac√°n State [
 <xref rid="B47-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The anxiolytic effects produced by the ingestion of inflorescences of 
 <italic>Tilia</italic> var mexicana have been attributed to kaempferol-3,7-O-dirhamnoside (kaempferitrin), quercetin-3-pentosylhexoside, kaempferol-3-pentosylhexoside, quercetin-3-O-glucoside (isoquercitrin), kaempferol-3-O-glucoside (astragalin), quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside (quercitrin), kaempferol-3-O-rhamnoside, kaempferol-3-O-(6-p-coumaroyl)-glucoside (tiliroside), quercetin-3,7-O-dirhamnoside, quercetin-3-O-rutinoside (rutin), quercetin-3-pentoside, quercetin-malonylhexoside, which were detected in 
 <italic>Tilia</italic> flowers and bracts from three different regions of Mexico [

 <xref rid="B88-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Preclinical pharmacological studies indicate that flowers of 
 <italic>Tilia americana</italic> var mexicana exhibit anxiolytic, sedative [
 <xref rid="B89-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>] and anticonvulsant effects [
 <xref rid="B90-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>], as well as potential properties in the management of stroke [
 <xref rid="B91-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. In addition, preclinical evidence suggests the use of 
 <italic>Tilia</italic> for pain treatment [
 <xref rid="B92-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>], suggesting that quercetin (
