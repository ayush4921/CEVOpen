 <italic>Ligusticum porter</italic>, best known as “chuchupate”, is a plant that grows in the pine-oak forest of the northern Sierra Madre Occidental region [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This plant belongs to the Apiaceae family and its traditional uses are related to the alleviation of stomach aches, colic, ulcers, diarrhea, infections, colds and rheumatic joints [
 <xref rid="B71-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. The tea from 
 <italic>L. porteri</italic> roots also produce analgesia [

 <xref rid="B75-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Other pharmacological properties of 
 <italic>L. porter</italic>, such as sedation, anti-spasmolytic [

 <xref rid="B77-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] and antinociceptive properties [

 <xref rid="B79-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>], have been observed in preclinical assays. Although this herb is widely consumed as a decoction, there are reports that the chronic administration of the hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol extracts of 
 <italic>L. porteri</italic> produce toxicity [
 <xref rid="B80-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Concomitantly, slight effects of acute toxicity were observed in mice, whereas a weak LC50 value (ranging from 436 to 778 μg/mL) was observed in the brine shrimp lethality assay [
 <xref rid="B81-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Furthermore, a phytochemical assay demonstrated the presence of flavonoids, phenols/tannins, triterpenoids/steroids and traces of alkaloids as the main constituents of 
 <italic>L. porteri</italic> [
 <xref rid="B80-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Phthalides are the major secondary metabolites. Relatedly, Z-ligustilide, Z-butylidenephtalide and diligustilide (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00865-f001">Figure 1</xref>) are the main bioactive compounds of this plant, which is responsible for the major pharmacological effects of 
 <italic>L. porteri</italic> [
 <xref rid="B82-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. However, the mechanisms of action leading to its antinociceptive properties remain unclear.
