The popular form of consumption of this plant is on the infusion of the fruits and leaves to alleviate coughs, whereas bathing with this plant in water is commonly used in the “Tajin” area as a protection against “mal de viento” or “mal aire” in children [

 <italic>L. hispida</italic> and its compounds has been described to treat tuberculosis [

 <xref rid="B175-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">175</xref>]. 3-acetoxy-22-(2′-methyl-2Z-butenyloxy)-12-oleanen-28-oic acid, 3-hydroxy-22 beta-(2′-methyl-2Z-butenoyloxy)-12-oleanen-28-oic acid (reduced lantadene A), oleanolic acid and ursolic acid have been described in the phytochemical composition of this plant [

 <italic>L. hispida</italic> demonstrated an anti-inflammatory effect on carrageenan-induced paw edema [

 <italic>Lantana</italic> genus, as in 
 <italic>Lantana trifolia</italic>, have shown anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects on carrageenan- and histamine-induced paw edema, as well as in hot plate and tail-flick thermal tests [

 <xref rid="B177-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">177</xref>]. Because of this, 
 <italic>L. hispida</italic> should be considered for evaluation in several neuropathic and inflammatory pain models, and its isolated compounds could also be tested.
