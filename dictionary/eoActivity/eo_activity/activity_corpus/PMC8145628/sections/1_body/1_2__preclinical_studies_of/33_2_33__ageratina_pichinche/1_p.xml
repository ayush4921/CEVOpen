 <italic>Ageratina pichinchensis</italic> or “axihuitl” is an endemic plant from Morelos State, which belongs to the Asteraceae family. This plant is also known by the scientific names 
 <italic>Eupatorium aschembornianum</italic> (Sch.) and 
 <italic>Eupatorium bustamentum</italic> DC. [

 <xref rid="B196-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">196</xref>]. This medicinal plant has been used for the treatment of skin wounds. Its pharmacological effects were demonstrated in preclinical assays of experimental wounds in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice and ethanol-induced gastric ulcers [

 <xref rid="B198-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">198</xref>]. 7-
 <italic>O</italic>-(β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranosyl)-galactin and 3,5-diprenyl-4-hydroxyacetophenone were identified as responsible for the pharmacological properties of this plant. No genotoxic effects were observed under the administration of aqueous and hexane-ethyl acetate extracts of 
 <italic>A. pichinchensis</italic>. Moreover, unpigmented hexane-ethyl acetate extract at 5% was evaluated over 11 days in patients with stomatitis, showing that 
 <italic>A. pichinchensis</italic> reduces the size of buccal lesions and pain scores, with an effectivity of 100% at the end of the study [

 <xref rid="B200-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">200</xref>], diabetic foot ulcers [
 <xref rid="B201-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">201</xref>] and tinea pedis [
 <xref rid="B202-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">202</xref>]. Despite several clinical studies, there is only one preclinical study about the antinociceptive and anti-neuropathic properties of this plant. In that study, oral administration of 100 and 556 mg/kg of 3,5-diprenyl-4-hydroxyacetophenone (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00865-f001">Figure 1</xref>) from 
 <italic>A. pichinchensis</italic> reduced nociception in the carrageenan model and spinal nerve ligated rats; however, the mechanisms of action of these effects were not demonstrated [
 <xref rid="B198-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">198</xref>]. In the future, the mechanism of action involved in these antinociceptive and anti-neuropathic effects should be explored.
