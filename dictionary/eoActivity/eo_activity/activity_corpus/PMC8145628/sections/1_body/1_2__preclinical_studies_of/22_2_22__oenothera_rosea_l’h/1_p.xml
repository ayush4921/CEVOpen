 <italic>O. rosea</italic> was able to reduce the paw edema for almost 7 h. In the same study, non-lethal effects were observed in the rats [

 <italic>O. rosea</italic> was displayed by the increased dose of ethanol or ethyl acetate extract (50–200 mg/kg). Oral administration of both extracts increased the latency response on the hot plate test and decreased the number of writhings induced by the acetic acid test [
