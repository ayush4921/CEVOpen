<p>The 
 <italic>Pittocaulon</italic> genus is endemic to Mexico and it grows in the form of strange shrubs and small trees in dry and semiarid parts of central and southern Mexico. Its common name in popular culture is “palo loco”. The genus 
 <italic>Pittocaulon</italic> belongs to the Asteraceae family and includes five species—
 <italic>P. praecox</italic>, 
 <italic>P. velatum</italic>, 
 <italic>P. bombycophole</italic>, 
 <italic>P. hintonii</italic> and 
 <italic>P. filare</italic> [

 <italic>Pittocaulon</italic> has been described, and pyrrolizidine alkaloids were identified in the five species of its genus [

 <xref rid="B182-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">182</xref>], whereas sesquiterpenois with eremophilane skeletons were found in 
 <italic>P. praecox, P. bombycophole</italic>, 
 <italic>P. velatum</italic> and 
 <italic>P. filare</italic> species [
 <xref rid="B178-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">178</xref>]. Regarding the traditional uses of this plant as medicine, 
 <italic>P. praecox, P. velatum, P. bombycophole</italic> and 
 <italic>P. hintonii</italic> species demonstrated antibacterial and antifungal activity [
 <xref rid="B182-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">182</xref>]. On the other hand, extracts of 
 <italic>P. velatum</italic> and a methanolic extract of 
 <italic>P. bombycophole</italic> inhibited 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TAP)-induced ear edema, presumably through an antioxidant effect, as demonstrated in the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) assay [
 <xref rid="B181-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">181</xref>]. In the same study, the carrageenan test—a model characterized by inflammation and hyperalgesia—was used to test the anti-inflammatory effect of dichloromethane extracts of the roots of different species of 
 <italic>Pittocaulon</italic> (100 mg/kg). The results did not show a significant inhibition of paw edema. Moreover, sesquiterpenoids present in 
 <italic>Pittocaulon filare</italic> inhibited the neutrophil infiltration in ear edema [
