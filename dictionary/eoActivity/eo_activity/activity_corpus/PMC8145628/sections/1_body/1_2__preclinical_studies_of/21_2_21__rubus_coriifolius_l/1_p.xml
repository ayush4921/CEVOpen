 <italic>Robus coriifolius</italic> is a plant belonging to the Rosaceae family, which growths in a wild form in Michoacán, Veracruz, Morelos and Chiapas. This plant has a red-black fruit and because of this it is named “zarzamora silvestre”. Local people use a decoction of this plant to treat diarrhea and dysentery [
 <xref rid="B144-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. (-)-Epicatechin, (+)-catechin, hyperin, nigaichigoside F1, β-sitosterol 3-O-β-d-glucopyranoside, gallic acid and ellagic acid are some of the chemical bioactive compounds of this plant [
 <xref rid="B145-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>]. Moreover, the evidence suggests that antiparasitic effects exerted by 
 <italic>R. coriifolius</italic> are mediated by (-)-epicatechin [

 <italic>R. coriifolius</italic>. In line with preclinical studies, its anti-inflammatory properties have been demonstrated in an inflammatory pain model induced by carrageenan [
 <xref rid="B136-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. No toxicity was observed at anti-inflammatory doses. In addition, these data are supported by the genotoxicity and subacute toxicity testing of ethanolic extracts of 
 <italic>R. coriifolius</italic> [
 <xref rid="B147-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. Since its major bioactive compound is (-)-epicatechin (

 <italic>R. coriifolius</italic> might be explored in other experimental models of pain.
