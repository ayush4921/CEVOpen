<p>The marine algae 
 <italic>Caulerpa Mexicana</italic> belongs to the Cauleparceae family and its distribution is linked to tropical seas. Because of this, it has been found on the coast of Brazil, Florida and Quintana Roo in MÃ©xico [
 <xref rid="B47-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Its antinociceptive, anti-inflammatory and gastroprotective effects have been associated with sulphated polysaccharides from 
 <italic>Caulerpa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B56-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,
 <xref rid="B57-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,
 <xref rid="B58-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Some mechanisms of action have been studied, suggesting that its anti-inflammatory actions are related to decreased leukocyte migration [
 <xref rid="B56-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], whereas that of gastroprotection is mediated by the reduction of oxidative stress and possible prostaglandin actions [
 <xref rid="B57-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Moreover, non toxic effects were observed after the administration of 20 mg/kg of 
 <italic>Caulerpa mexicana,</italic> suggesting an important medical potential.
