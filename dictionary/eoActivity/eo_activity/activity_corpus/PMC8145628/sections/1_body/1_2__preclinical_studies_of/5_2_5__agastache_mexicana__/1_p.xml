 <italic>Agastache mexicana</italic> is a folk plant member of the Laminiciae family, which grows in the wild in oak–pine forests of México State, Michoacán, Puebla, Guanajuato, Tlaxcala, Morelos, Veracruz and México City [

 <xref rid="B59-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Traditionally known as “toronjil morado”, the common uses of this plant are in the treatment of stomach ache, cough, bile, fever, vomit, nerves and anxiety. However, the main use of 
 <italic>A. mexicana</italic> is to heal “susto” or “espanto”, a cultural disease related with the loss of the soul and characterized by anxiety [
 <xref rid="B60-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Further, the pharmacological properties of its plant have been tested in several preclinical assays, exhibiting effects on spasmolytic activity [
 <xref rid="B61-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], as well as bronchorelaxant [
 <xref rid="B62-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] and antihypertensive [
 <xref rid="B63-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] effects. Several effects on the central nervous system, such as sedation, reduced locomotor activity and central nervous system inhibition, were observed after administration of low doses of 
 <italic>A. mexicana</italic> [
 <xref rid="B64-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Moreover, tilianin, a bioactive compound of 
 <italic>A. Mexicana</italic>, has vasorelaxant [
 <xref rid="B65-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] and anxiolytic-like activity [
 <xref rid="B66-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], without toxic effects [
 <xref rid="B67-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. On the other hand, ursolic acid and acacetin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00865-f001">Figure 1</xref>) are responsible for the antinociceptive properties of this plant [
 <xref rid="B30-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B68-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,
 <xref rid="B69-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], suggesting the participation of cGMP and 5-HT
 <sub>1A</sub> receptors. Moreover, the antineuropathic properties of this plant might be revised in the future. Since ursolic acid is the bioactive compound responsible for its antinociceptive effect, there are a reports of anti-hyperalgesia (mechanical and heat) induced by ursolic acid in a chronic constriction injury model; hence, 
 <italic>A. mexicana</italic> may exert a potential effect on neuropathic pain [
