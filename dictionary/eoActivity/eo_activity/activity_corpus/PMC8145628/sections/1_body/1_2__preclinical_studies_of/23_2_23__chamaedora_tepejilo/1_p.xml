 <italic>Chameadora tepejilote</italic>, commonly named “tepejilote” or “palma pacaya”, is a medicinal plant that is widely distributed, mainly in Oaxaca, Chiapas, Veracruz and Tabasco. It is a member of the Arecaceae family. It has been used in folk medicine to treat illnesses or afflictions related to respiratory functions. Its traditional uses are supported by pharmacological studies in experimental tuberculosis, in which ursolic and oleanolic acid, as well as squalene and farnesol isolated from 
 <italic>C. tepejilote</italic>, displayed antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> [
