 <italic>Astianthus viminalis</italic> is a folk plant called “Azuchil” by residents of southern Mexico [
 <xref rid="B47-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. This plant belongs to the Bignoniaceae family, and its phytochemical composition was studied for the first time by Alvarez et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Antimicrobial properties have been proposed for cinnamic and p-methoxycinn acid, the iridoid glucoside campenoside and 5-hydroxycampenoside compounds. In the same study, other bioactive compounds, such as ursolic and oleanolic acids, were detected. Moreover, 3β,19α-dihydroxyurs-12,20(21)-diene-28-oic acid, a derivate from this plant, showed an anti-hyperglycemic effect in an experimental model of diabetes [
 <xref rid="B155-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>]. This study supported and addressed the antidiabetic uses of this plant in Mexican folk medicine. To our best knowledge, 
 <italic>Astianthus viminalis</italic> is not used to treat inflammatory or neuropathic pain, although there is evidence on the anti-inflammatory effects of the methanol extract of this plant on carrageenan-induced paw edema in rats [
