 <xref rid="B85-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] or “huizache” is one of the shrubs most common in arid and semiarid regions throughout México. This plant belonging to the Fabaceae family is characterized by the production of a pod that is rich in fiber, protein, nitrogenated elements and tannins, which are the main source of nutrients for wild sheep [
 <xref rid="B139-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. The common medicinal uses of huizache are to treat diarrhea, dysentery, tuberculosis and indigestion. Phytochemical characterization of this plant revelated that 22E-stimasta-5,22-dien-3β-ol, 22E-stimasta-5,22-dien-3β-ol, 22E-stimasta-5,22-dien-3β-acetyl, 22E-stimasta-5,22-dien-3β-acetyl, tetracosanoic acid (2S)-2, 3-dihydroxypropyl ester, tetracosanoic acid (2

 <xref rid="B140-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. Furthermore, the presence acasiane A, acasiane B, farnesirane A and farnesirane B was reported by Lin et al. [
 <xref rid="B141-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>]. Relaxant and anti-inflammatory effects have been observed in a glucosidal fraction of the pods of this plant [
 <xref rid="B142-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. On the other hand, the antinociceptive effects of this plant were studied in an inflammatory model. The methanol extract of 
 <italic>A. farnesiana</italic> reduced the paw edema induced by carrageenan; however, the hexane and chloroform extracts produced death in the animals [
 <xref rid="B136-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. This antinociceptive effect might be explained by the fact that chloroformic, hexanic and ketonic extracts from 
 <italic>A. farnesiana</italic> induce anti-inflammatory effects through the inhibition of prostaglandins and interleukins such as IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 [
