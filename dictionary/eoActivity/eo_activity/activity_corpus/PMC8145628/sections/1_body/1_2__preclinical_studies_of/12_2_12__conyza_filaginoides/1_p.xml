 <italic>Conyza filaginoides</italic> or “simonillo” is a medicinal plant belong to the Asteraceae family, which is employed in Mexican culture to treat stomach ailments [

 <xref rid="B103-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. In México, this plant is widely commercialized and its presence was recently reported in geographic areas such as Querétaro, Nuevo León and Oaxaca [

 <italic>C. filaginoides</italic> were able to show antiprotozoal activity against 
 <italic>Giardia lamblia</italic> or 
 <italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic> [

 <italic>C. filaginoides</italic>, a relaxing effect on the smoot muscle in the ileum rat was related with flavonoids, sterol, sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoids [

 <italic>C. filaginoides</italic> were demonstrated in normo- and hyperglycemic mice, suggesting that this folk plant can be used in inflammatory and neuropathic pain treatment. Moreover, the authors suggested that rutoside, quercetin-3-O-rutinoside, also commonly called “rutin” (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00865-f001">Figure 1</xref>), induces antinociceptive effects, which is prevented by the administration of flumazenil, bicuculline or naltrexone in a formalin test. These results suggest that rutoside, one of the main constituents of 
 <italic>Conyza filaginoides</italic>, is the compound responsible for its antinociceptive effects, suggesting the activation of the GABAergic and opioid systems [
