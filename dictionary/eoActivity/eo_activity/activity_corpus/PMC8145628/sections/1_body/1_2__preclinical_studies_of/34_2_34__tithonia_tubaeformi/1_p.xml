 <italic>Tithonia tubaeformis,</italic> best known as “acahual”, “palocote”, “gigantón” or “andan”, is an annual herb native to Mexico which grows throughout the entire country [
 <xref rid="B203-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">203</xref>]. This native plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, one of the most studied families, although its phytochemical composition and its therapeutic uses have been not studied. This plant is commonly characterized by yellow flowers and is used to feed cattle as it grows in the form of undergrowth in an invasive way [
 <xref rid="B204-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">204</xref>]. The phytochemical screening of this plant displayed the presence of bioactive compounds like tannins, phenols, flavonoids, coumarins, steroids and alkaloids. An in vitro assay demonstrated for the first time the anti-inflammatory activity of a methanolic extract from 
 <italic>T. tubaeformis</italic> on the inhibition of porcine pancreatic elastase [
 <xref rid="B205-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">205</xref>]. Furthermore, its analgesic effect was demonstrated with the administration of an oral increased dose of a hydroalcoholic extract (100 and 200 mg/kg) in the acid acetic-induced writhing and tail immersion tests. Furthermore, the same doses of hydroalcoholic extract reduced tactile allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in vincristine-induced neuropathy [
 <xref rid="B206-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>]. Mice treated with 2000 mg/kg of methanolic extract from 
 <italic>T. tubaeformis</italic> did not show behavioral changes, cyanosis, or other signs. Its oral acute toxicological profile was well tolerated. These results open a new field to investigate the therapeutic uses of this plant.
