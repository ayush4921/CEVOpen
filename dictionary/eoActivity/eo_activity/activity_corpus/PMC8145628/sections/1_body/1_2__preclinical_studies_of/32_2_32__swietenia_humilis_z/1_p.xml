 <italic>Swietenia humilis,</italic> belonging to the 
 <italic>Meliaceae</italic> family, is a medium-size tree grown in tropical areas in Mexico. This tree is also known as “Zopilote” or “caobilla”, and produces a seed that is used to treat diabetes type 2 [
 <xref rid="B23-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Due to its folk uses, preclinical assays of this plant have been focused on diabetes type 2 and metabolic syndrome, finding that it produced antihyperglycemic, hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects, suggesting the participation of K
 <sub>ATP</sub> channels, insulin secretion and the modulation of 5-HT
 <sub>2</sub> receptors [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00865-f001">Figure 1</xref>) were investigated in formalin-induced hyperalgesia in diabetic rats. The data suggested that its anti-hyperalgesic effect is mediated by the activation of nitric oxide and GABAergic, opioidergic and serotonergic (5-HT
 <sub>2A/C</sub>) pathways, as well as activation of guanylyl cyclase and K
 <sub>ATP</sub> channels [

 <italic>Swietenia humillis</italic> should be evaluated in inflammatory pain models.
