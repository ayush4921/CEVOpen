 <italic>Salvia divinorum</italic> is a native plant from the Sierra Mazateca region in Oaxaca México. Its name derives from its traditional use by Mazatec people in “mystic” and “spiritual” ceremonies due to its hallucinogenic properties. Since Epling and Játiva-M described the plant [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] based on specimens collected by Hofmann and Wasson (initially named “xka pastora”) [
 <xref rid="B33-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], the psychopharmacology and effects of this plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family have been studied [
 <xref rid="B34-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. 
 <italic>S. divinorum</italic> presents a psychotomimetic selectivity for kappa opioid receptors [
 <xref rid="B35-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], without serotoninergic actions [
 <xref rid="B36-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The uses of 
 <italic>S. divinorum</italic> extend to anemia, diarrhea, headache, and rheumatism treatments, which have been reported to be practiced by “curanderos mazatecas” or healers [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The main constituent of 
 <italic>S. divinorum</italic> is a neoclerodane diterpene, salvinorin A [
 <xref rid="B37-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]; however, salvinorin B [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and other constituents such as salvinorins C to J [

 <xref rid="B40-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], divinatorins A to F [

 <xref rid="B41-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], salvinicins A and B [
 <xref rid="B42-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and salvidivins A to D [
 <xref rid="B40-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] have been isolated from 
 <italic>S. divinorum</italic> leaves. In this regard, reports have indicated that under systemic [
 <xref rid="B43-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and intrathecal [
 <xref rid="B45-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] administration of salvinorin A (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00865-f001">Figure 1</xref>), antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects were observed [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], whereas anti-neuropathic effects were exhibited with systemic administration of an ethyl acetate extract of 
 <italic>S. divinorum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B46-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Both inflammatory and neuropathic pain models demonstrate that properties of 
 <italic>S. divinorum</italic> are mediated through the activation of kappa opioid receptors [
 <xref rid="B33-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. More recently, Tlacomulco-Flores et al. [
 <xref rid="B35-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] developed a preclinical assay with a salvinorin mixture and ethyl acetate extract from 
 <italic>S. divinorum</italic>, suggesting that the antinociceptive effect of extract of salvinorin mixture displayed in the formalin test is due to activation of opioids, whereas the antinociceptive effect in the abdominal contractions test involves opioid and 5-HT
 <sub>1A</sub> receptors. Nevertheless, the strong activation of the opioid system is related to hallucinogenic and mystic-type effects. Moreover, cognitive, affective, and perception changes, but not blood pressure, heart rate changes, or adverse effects, were associated with the consumption of salvinorin A [
