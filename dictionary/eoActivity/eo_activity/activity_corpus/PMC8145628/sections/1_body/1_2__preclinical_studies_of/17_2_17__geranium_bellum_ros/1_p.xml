 <italic>Geramium bellum</italic> Rose is a traditional plant commonly used to treat fever, pain and gastrointestinal disorders. In the local market is best known as “pata de león”; however, the origin of this plant can be inferred from its perennial growth in the mountains of the Hidalgo State of México [
 <xref rid="B127-plants-10-00865" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. The genus 
 <italic>Geramium</italic> of the family Geraniaceae has been widely studied; however, 
 <italic>G. bellum</italic> and its pharmacological effects have not been extensively studied. Concerning the phytochemical composition of this plant, the literature reports that corilagin, gallic acid, methyl gallate, methyl brevifolincarboxylate, quercetin, quercetin 3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, quercetin 3-O-β-D-[6″-O-galloyl)glucopyranoside, kaempferol, β-sitosterol 3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, beta-sitosterol and kaempferol 3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside are the major bioactive constituents of 
 <italic>G. bellum</italic> [

The chemical description of these compounds is important in order to give an idea about the pharmacological properties of this folk plant. In line with this, methyl brevifolincarboxylate, ethylbrevifolin carboxylate and butylbrevifolin carboxylate compounds are responsible for the antiparasitic activity of this plant [

 <italic>G. bellum</italic> displayed antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects in a murine model. Nevertheless, the mechanism of action underlying its antinociceptive effect was not studied [
