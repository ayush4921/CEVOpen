<p>The joint detection of fasting lipids and postprandial lipids is helpful for clinicians to collect the lipid metabolism of patients more comprehensively, evaluate the risk of cardiovascular disease more accurately, and play a complementary role in diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, postprandial lipemia detection is recommended for clinical application as a Supplementary Material. Recently, postprandial lipemia was found to be well-suited to be measured by quantile-dependent expression, which significantly increases the exposure of individual's gene phenotypes in plasma TG (

Further research on postprandial dyslipidemia and postprandial hyperlipidemia and an in-depth exploration of its mechanism and intervention measures may provide a new direction for the regulation of public health. Gut microbiota is closely related to lipid metabolism, and some studies have indicated that intestinal microorganisms may affect lipid metabolism as environmental factors (

There are few reports on the relationship between postprandial lipemia and gut microbiota, but animal studies have shown that gut microbiota increases the level of epoxyeicosatrienoic acid and improves CVD by inhibiting postprandial soluble epoxide hydrolase (
