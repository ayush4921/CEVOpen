<p>The mechanism of AS induced by TRL needs to be further studied on the basis of the postprandial TG curve, and the standardized fat load test still needs improvement (

 <xref rid="B146" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>). CVD caused by postprandial dyslipidemia has been reflected in many clinical cases. The mechanism of postprandial lipemia affecting the occurrence and development of AS may be endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammation, or others (

 <xref rid="B151" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>). The accumulation of hepatic apoB100 and circulating intestinal apoB48 TRL are characteristic phenomena of postprandial lipemia, and both of them are involved in the development of atherosclerotic plaque (

 <xref rid="B153" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>), age, sex, and menopausal state], as well as lifestyle (diet, physical activity, smoking, and drug use), can affect postprandial lipids (

 <xref rid="B155" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>). Non-medicinal therapy including diet adjustment and exercise has beneficial effects on CVD (
 <xref rid="B156" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>). The mechanism of anti-AS of dietary intervention on postprandial lipemia is mainly inflammatory change, while exercise shows more improvement in postprandial oxidative stress. The anti-atherosclerotic mechanism of medicinal interventions such as, statins, fibrate, ezetimibe, and omega-3 fatty acids on postprandial lipemia is mostly manifested as improvement of vascular endothelial function. As novel intervention methods, pemafibrate, PCSK9 inhibitors, and apoCIII inhibitors are the hot spots of current research.
