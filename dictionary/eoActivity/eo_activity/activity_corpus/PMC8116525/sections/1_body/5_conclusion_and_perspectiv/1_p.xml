<p>Fasting lipemia is a diagnostic standard for hyperlipidemia; the body is in the postprandial state most of the time, so the effect of postprandial lipemia on the human body is worthy of attention. The increase in postprandial TG is the main manifestation of postprandial hyperlipidemia. The relationship between diurnal TG pattern and postprandial blood lipid is worthy of further exploration. The results show that TG has a larger diurnal organism than TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, and other lipoproteins. Therefore, postprandial lipemia detection may reflect the true level of TG. A meta-analysis of 113 studies showed that the level of TG 4 h after the fat tolerance test was the most representative (

Research showed that compared with the detection of postprandial TG, increment and total area under the curve before and after the meal tested hourly for 6 h and subjects that had blood drawn before and 4 h after meals without restriction of activity had results similar to those of the previous test, which provided a simple method for the detection and application of postprandial lipemia (
