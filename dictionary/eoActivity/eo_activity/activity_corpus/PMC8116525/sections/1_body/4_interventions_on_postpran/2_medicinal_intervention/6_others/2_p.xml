<p>ApoCIII regulates TG metabolism by inhibiting TG hydrolysis. It has been reported to predict postprandial hypertriglyceridemia independently (
 <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>). Evidence showed that apoCIII not only inhibited LPL activity but also restrained the removal of TRLs by LPL-independent pathways (
