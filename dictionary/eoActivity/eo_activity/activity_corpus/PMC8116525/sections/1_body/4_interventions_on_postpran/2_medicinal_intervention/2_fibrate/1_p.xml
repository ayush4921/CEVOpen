<p>Fibrates are agonists of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPAR-α), regulating lipoprotein metabolism 
 <italic>via</italic> transcription factors. Fibrates have advantages in reducing fasting and postprandial TG and TRL remnant particles (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Yamashita et al. reported that treatment with pemafibrate, a novel selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α modulator (SPPARMα), enhances reverse cholesterol transport and improves postprandial hyperlipidemia in patients with dyslipidemia (
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>). Pemafibrate was demonstrated to improve liver function test values and is unlikely to enhance serum creatinine or reduce estimated glomerular filtration rate (

 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>) reported that pemafibrate attenuates postprandial hypertriglyceridemia by suppressing the postprandial increase of CM and the accumulation of CM remnants more effectively than fenofibrate in mice. Compared with conventional fibrates, pemafibrate has a better benefit–risk balance, which can be applied to patients who are difficult to use existing fibrates such as patients taking statins or with renal insufficiency (
