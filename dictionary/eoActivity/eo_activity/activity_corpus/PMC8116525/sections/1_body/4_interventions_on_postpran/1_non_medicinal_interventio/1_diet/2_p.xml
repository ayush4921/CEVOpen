<p>A systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of fat content on postprandial TG response after an oral fat tolerance test showed that there was no difference in response to saturated fatty acids (SFA) and unsaturated fatty acids within 4 h; a lower response to polyunsaturated fatty acids occurred within 8 h, and only a trend was observed for monounsaturated fatty acids, indicating that the postprandial TG response stimulated by different fatty acids is not enough to distinguish in fat tolerance tests shorter than 8 h (
