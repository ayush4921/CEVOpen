<p>Postprandial lipemia is closely related to dietary habits and meal composition (
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>). The generation of CM and the change in postprandial lipemia were highly affected by the single meal nutrition structure (
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>). The release of fatty acids from solid food was lower than that from liquid or semisolid food, and the postprandial TG elevation caused by solid food was lower than that of liquid food (

 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>). Postprandial CM-TG response increased with an increase in dietary fat content in normal weight and obese individuals (
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>). The remnant lipoprotein (RLP) particles containing apoB100 and apoB48 promote the formation and development of AS, and the intervention of postprandial RLP interferes with this (
