<p>There are many mechanisms involved in exercise intervention of postprandial lipemia. Regular aerobic exercise protects endothelial function after a high-fat mixed meal (

A study to evaluate the effect of 4 h interrupted sitting with 5 min stair climbing after an HFM on vascular found that FMD decreased from 9.41 ± 2.61 to 10.34 ± 3.30% after exercise, indicating that the improvement of lifestyle can prevent postprandial vascular dysfunction. Exercise increases fat oxidation after meals (

 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>) explored the effect of acute moderate resistance exercise on alleviating postprandial oxidative stress and found that the AUC of advanced oxidation protein products at 4 h after meal was significantly lower than that at rest, and total nitrate/nitrite increased, illustrating that acute resistance exercise can reduce postprandial oxidative stress (
