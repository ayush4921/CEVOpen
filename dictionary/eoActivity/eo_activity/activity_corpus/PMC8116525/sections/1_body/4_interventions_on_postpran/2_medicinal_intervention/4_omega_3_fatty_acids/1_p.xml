<p>Tinker et al. (
 <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>) proposed that omega-3 fatty acids may reduce the postprandial TRL apoB by inhibiting the synthesis and secretion of apoB in the liver and intestine. In middle-aged and older adults &gt;40 years, it was found that a high-fish diet can inhibit the production of apoB100 and promote its catabolism to reduce the level of TRL apoB48 after meals (
