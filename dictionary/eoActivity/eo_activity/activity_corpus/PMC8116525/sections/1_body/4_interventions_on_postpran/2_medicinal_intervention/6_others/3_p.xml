<p>Traditional Chinese medicine is also widely used in the intervention of atherosclerosis. Zhu et al. found that Ilexgenin A (IA) extracted from 
 <italic>Ilex hainanensis</italic> can induce endothelial cells to produce NO, reduce the production of inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species, and improve endothelial dysfunction (

 <italic>platycodi radix</italic> beverage (AP). The control group received HFM and a placebo. Blood samples were collected at 0, 2, 4, and 6 h after a meal, and TG and lipoprotein lipase quality were analyzed. The results showed that the plasma lipoprotein lipase quality in the AP group increased significantly at 6 h, and VLDL-TG decreased significantly. It is suggested that a 
 <italic>platycodi radix</italic> beverage may improve postprandial TG response, reduce postprandial lipemia, and decrease the risk of AS by improving the quality of lipoprotein lipase (
