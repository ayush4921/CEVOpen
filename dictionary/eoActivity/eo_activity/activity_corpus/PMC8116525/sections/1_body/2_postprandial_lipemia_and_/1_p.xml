<p>Plasma contains hepatogenic atherogenic lipoprotein in the fasting state and enterogenic atherogenic lipoprotein in the non-fasting state. Individuals spend more than 18 h a day in a non-fasting state (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Thus, lipid metabolism cannot be accurately reflected by fasting lipemia. Postprandial lipemia independently predicts the risk of CVD and likely better reflects the plasma atherogenic lipoprotein levels (

 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Non-fasting TG has been shown to be superior to fasting TG in predicting cardiovascular risk (
