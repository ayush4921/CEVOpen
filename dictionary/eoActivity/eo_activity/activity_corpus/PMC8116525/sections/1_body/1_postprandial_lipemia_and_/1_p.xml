<p>Dyslipidemia generally refers to all kinds of serum dyslipidemia, including total cholesterol (TC), TG, and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), and as initial factors leading to AS (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Postprandial lipemia refers to the fluctuation of blood lipid levels between the period after eating and the premeal level and is characterized by rising levels of TG-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). TG mainly comes from the decomposition of fat in the diet and can be generated by metabolic activities in the body. VLDL and CM are the main forms of plasma TG, which are collectively termed TRLs (

The roles of TG and TRL in the pathogenesis of CVD were reviewed by the European Atherosclerosis Society Consensus Panel, which considered that the number of TRLs plays an important role in the relationship between TG and CVD, and apoB100-containing TRLs are a pathological factor promoting the formation of hyperlipidemia (
