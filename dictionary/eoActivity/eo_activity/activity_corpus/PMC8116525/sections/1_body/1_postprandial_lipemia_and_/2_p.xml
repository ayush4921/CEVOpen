<p>The modern diet consists of three to five feeding times a day, and individuals spend a significant amount of time in a non-fasting and postprandial state, meaning the levels of CM, VLDL, and other TRLs and their remnants are enhanced, which leads a continually fluctuating level of blood lipid (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The postprandial metabolic status can be better reflected by postprandial TG concentration, and with the combination of fasting TG concentration, the degree of exposure of total TG in the arterial wall within 24 h can be described more comprehensively and accurately (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). TG reflects the burden of remnant cholesterol (RC) and can be used as its marker. A Mendelian randomized design examining the relationship between non-fasting RC and ischemic heart disease found that when non-fasting RC increased by 1 mmol/L (39 mg/dl), the causal risk of ischemic heart disease increased by 2.8 times and was not associated with decreased HDL cholesterol (

 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) observed serum lipid levels and carotid artery media thickness in 61 patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and found that the minimum value of postprandial TG-induced AS was 2.27 mmol/L, suggesting that this concentration level could be diagnosed as postprandial hyperlipidemia. A few aspects of non-fasting and postprandial TG were discussed, and some recommendations were proposed by a panel of clinicians and scientists. It was pointed out that TG levels &lt;2.5 mmol/L at any time after a meal can be regarded as the ideal level of postprandial TG (
