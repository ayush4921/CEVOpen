<p>Circadian rhythm is essential for maintaining life cycle. The diurnal pattern of TG and gut microbiota changes after a high-fat diet, which affects physiological homeostasis (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Glucocorticoid receptors (GC) regulate circulating TG differently during non-fasting and fasting. Animal experiments showed that the daytime TG level of mice decreased after hepatocyte-specific GC was knocked out, suggesting that circadian rhythm and daytime TG mode affect metabolism (
