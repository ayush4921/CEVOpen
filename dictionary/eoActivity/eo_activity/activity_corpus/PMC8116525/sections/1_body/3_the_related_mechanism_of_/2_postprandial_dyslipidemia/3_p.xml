<p>Tsai et al. conducted a clinical trial evaluating the effect of postprandial lipemia on oxidative stress in 16 healthy subjects without coronary risk factors. Serum TG, plasma glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) levels, and urine excretion of 8-external prostaglandin F2 (8-PGF2) were monitored, and brachial artery FMD was evaluated by high-resolution ultrasound before and 2, 4, and 6 h after the standard HFM. The results showed that after HFM, TG increased significantly; GSH-PX level decreased, declaring increased antioxidant enzyme consumption. The excretion of 8-PGF2 increased, indicating the increase of oxidative modification products. FMD decreased, suggesting that oxidative stress was enhanced after meal and endothelial dysfunction occurred in healthy individuals (

 </inline-formula> production were significantly higher than before meal, whereas the postprandial FMD level was lower than before meal, which suggested that an acute increase in postprandial TG may cause endothelial dysfunction through elevated oxidative stress. Neri et al. conducted an HFM test in 40 patients with T2D, 40 patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and 40 healthy subjects. Serum TG, markers of systemic oxidative stress, and endothelial function were measured before and 2, 4, and 8 h after a meal. The results showed that the postprandial TG in each group was higher than the baseline, and the postprandial TG level of T2D patients was significantly higher than that of the IGT group, which was higher than that of the control group. Postprandial TG was significantly enriched in T2D patients and IGT patients at 4 h, while TG was enriched at 2 and 4 h in healthy subjects. The urinary level of free 8-iso-prostaglandin F
 <sub>2α</sub> (8-iso-PGF
 <sub>2α</sub>; F2-isoprostanes) in each group was higher than that in the fasting state. FMD in T2D and IGT patients decreased significantly at 4 h, demonstrating that the changes of postprandial lipemia were closely related to the systematic markers of oxidative stress and led to the impairment of vasodilation function (

It was found that thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) increased and red blood cell reducing glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) decreased after HFM in patients with T2D with macrovascular complications, illustrating that damage to antioxidant capacity might lead to endothelial dysfunction (
