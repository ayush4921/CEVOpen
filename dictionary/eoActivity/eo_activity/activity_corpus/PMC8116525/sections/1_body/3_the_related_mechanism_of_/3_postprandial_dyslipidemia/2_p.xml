<p>Inflammation plays a key role in the activation of endogenous and adaptive immune pathways in the pathophysiological process of AS. Vascular inflammation is caused by the accumulation and modification of atherosclerotic lipoprotein in the subendothelium, which leads to the changes in vascular structure, the development of AS, and the pathological formation of CVD (

The augment of postprandial TG is related to the upregulation of proinflammatory genes in endothelial cells, the increased expression of leukocyte activation markers, and the involvement of the complement system. These processes together constitute part of postprandial inflammation and are considered to be the potential mechanism of promoting AS (
