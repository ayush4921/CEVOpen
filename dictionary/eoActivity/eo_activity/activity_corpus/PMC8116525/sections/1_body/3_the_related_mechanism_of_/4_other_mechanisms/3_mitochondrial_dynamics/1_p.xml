<p>The mitochondria are thought to be the cell's power source because they produce the metabolic fuel ATP (
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>). Inflammation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress can promote the development of atherosclerotic plaques, and dysfunction caused by mitochondrial injury can promote these processes (
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>). Animal experiments showed that the binding rate of mitochondrial guanosine diphosphate (GDP) in brown adipose tissue was measured at one or more time points after the dietary test to indicate the uncoupling respiration rate, and Na
 <sup>+</sup>-K
 <sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity represented the coupled rate. It was found that the binding rate of GDP increased by 85% after the test, and the increase was the largest in the early postprandial period. It significantly decreased at 10 h after meal. This indicates that the proton conduction pathway in brown adipose tissue can be activated after a single meal (
