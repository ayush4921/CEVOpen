<p>As previously reported, HAEC can induce an atherosclerotic state by TRL isolated from human blood after HFM. Wang et al. explored the role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in TRL metabolism and VCAM-1 regulation. Blood samples were collected before and 3.5 h after HFM from healthy subjects and hypertriglyceridemia patients. TRL was separated from postprandial blood samples by ultracentrifugation. HAECs were cultured in Petri dishes for 4 h. The HAEC endoplasmic reticulum morphology was imaged by confocal microscopy and immunofluorescence staining of calreticulin. It was found that the expansion of ER was significantly increased by HAEC treated with postprandial TRL, and the production of TRL after meals increased the adhesion of VCAM-1-dependent monocytes to the inflammatory endothelium. It was indicated that ER stress plays a role in the regulation of VCAM-1 transcription in endothelial cells during the process of atherosclerosis induced by postprandial lipemia (
