<p>A large number of studies have shown that flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) is affected by postprandial lipemia. It was found that TG increased but FMD decreased postprandially. The increment area under the curve (iAUC) of postprandial TG was negatively correlated with the decrement area under the curve of postprandial FMD, indicating that FMD had transient and significant injury in the postprandial phase and was closely related to postprandial TG (

The TC and TG levels were detected, and endothelial function was assessed by measuring serum nitrite/nitrate levels (NO
 <sub>2</sub>/NO
 <sub>3</sub>). It was found that 2 h after the meal, the TG levels increased (
