<p>Shafieesabet et al. explored the acute effect of HFM on the changes of peripheral vascular endothelial function in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The peripheral vascular endothelial function of patients was evaluated by EndoPAT 2000 technology at baseline and 1, 2, 3, and 4 h after oral TG load using reactive hyperemia index and pulse wave amplitude. Compared with obviously postprandial vascular dilation in healthy individuals, HFrEF patients did not show the same changes. It is suggested that peripheral vascular endothelium function was damaged postprandially in HFrEF patients (

Postprandial TRL is thought to be a contributing factor to AS; Whisner et al. assessed the effects of meal with different dietary components on endothelial function in 10 adolescents aged 10–17 years. TG and FMD were measured at baseline and 4 h postprandially. The results showed that TG at 4 h was negatively correlated with FMD after high-fat and low-fiber meal (β = −0.087; 95% CI = −0.138~-0.037;
