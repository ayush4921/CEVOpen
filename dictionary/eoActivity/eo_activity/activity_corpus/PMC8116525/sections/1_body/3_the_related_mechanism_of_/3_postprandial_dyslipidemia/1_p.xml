<p>The instability of lipid metabolism and chronic postprandial inflammation are the underlying pathogenesis of AS-induced CVD (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). ApoB100-containing lipoproteins enter the arterial subendothelium and are retained by interaction with membrane proteoglycans through charge-based interactions and sphingolipases. The lipoproteins then become proinflammatory lipids by modification of aggregation, saccharification, and oxidation, promoting the expression of adhesion factors such as, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), inducing the augmentation of adhesion interaction of monocytes from circulating bone marrow and spleen, generating proinflammatory phenotypes, and producing the early stages of AS (
