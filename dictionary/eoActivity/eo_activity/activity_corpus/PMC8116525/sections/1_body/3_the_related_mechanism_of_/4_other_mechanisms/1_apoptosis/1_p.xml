<p>Dejeans et al. cultured HUVECs in a medium containing 10% serum extracted from healthy subjects before and after HFM to explore the effect of postprandial lipemia on vascular endothelial cells. It was found that the proliferation of HUVECs in postprandial hyperlipidemia was significantly lower than that before meal. The transcriptomic profiles of endothelial cells were changed, among which, a group of genes differentially expressed before and after meal was related to cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, and may be achieved by activating the p53 network. It was indicated that the transcription of genes related to apoptosis in vascular endothelial cells after exposure to postprandial hyperlipidemia may promote vascular dysfunction (

Blood samples were collected before and 1, 2, and 4 h after a meal. Plasma TG, myeloperoxidase (MPO), and matrix metalloprotein-9 (MMP-9) activities were measured. HUVECs were cultured in human serum and annexin PI staining and caspase-3 activity were detected by flow cytometry. The TG, activities of MPO, and pro-MMP-9 increased significantly at 4 h after meal. Postprandial serum significantly increased the percentage of annexin-positive HUVECs and the activity of caspase-3. These results indicate that HFM can promote the apoptosis of endothelial cells, and the apoptosis rate is closely related to the increase in MPO and pro-MMP-9 activity, suggesting a possible mechanism of endothelial injury induced by postprandial lipemia (
