<p>There is a strong relationship between the pro-oxidative load caused by absorption of postprandial lipid hydroperoxides and the impairment of endothelium-dependent vasodilation induced by postprandial lipemia (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced in large quantities under physiological and pathological conditions such as inflammation, ionizing radiation, and ischemia, due to the increased levels of free fatty acids mediated by mitochondrial dissociation and Î²-oxidation after meals (
