<p>Hyperlipidemia clinical diagnosis requires fasting lipemia, but individuals are in the postprandial state for most of the 24 h. Therefore, fasting lipemia cannot comprehensively and accurately reflect lipid metabolism (

 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). With the growing awareness of postprandial lipemia, its dynamic change is thought to be closely related to AS. Long-term disorders of lipid metabolism, endothelial dysfunction, and hypercoagulability can occur through postprandial hyperlipidemia, and it participates in AS-related processes (

Our objectives were to (1) review existing literature and study the causes of postprandial hyperlipidemia, (2) review the influence of postprandial lipid metabolism on the formation of AS and study the relationship between postprandial lipemia and AS, and (3) review the effects of postprandial lipemia on endothelial function, oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and mitochondrial dynamics, as well as analyze their mechanisms and explore potential interventions.
