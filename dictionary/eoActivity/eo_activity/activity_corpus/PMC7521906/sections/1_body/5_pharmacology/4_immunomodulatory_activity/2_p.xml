<p id="p0370">AR is commonly used as a TCM for strengthening spleen. The spleen, a vital secondary lymphoid organ, works in innate immune response owing to its participation in immune memory and phagocytosis. AR and AM pharmaceutical uses differ in traditional Japanese Kampo medicine and TCM, with less apparent scientific evidence. 
 <xref rid="bib94" ref-type="bibr">Shimato et al. (2018)</xref> compared the immunomodulatory activity between Byakujutsu (
 <italic>A. macrocephala</italic> and 
 <italic>A. japonica</italic>) and Sojutsu (
 <italic>A. chinensis</italic>, 
 <italic>A. lancea</italic>, and the hybrids). The extract of 
 <italic>A. japonica</italic> significantly induced granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) secretion from MCE301 cells in a concentration-dependent manner and had significantly higher activity than 
 <italic>A. macrocephala</italic>. However, these effects of Byakujutsu samples were not significantly different from those of Sojutsu samples. The methanol extract of 
 <italic>A. lancea</italic> could inhibit nitric oxide (NO) production in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated murine macrophage-like RAW264.7 cells and induce G-CSF secretion in murine normal colonic epithelial MCE301 cells. A neutral polysaccharide (ALP-1) and an acidic polysaccharide (ALP-3) were purified from 
 <italic>A. lancea</italic>. ALP-3 exhibited macrophage proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, and stimulated phagocytic, NO and cytokines production on RAW264.7 cells. In addition, ALP-1 and ALP-3 could activate T cells in Peyer patch cells and promote the production of CSF. ALP-3 is better than ALP-1 in regulating the intestinal immune system (

 <italic>A. lancea</italic> and the active clusters of polysaccharides were investigated (
