 <xref rid="bib94" ref-type="bibr">Shimato et al. (2018)</xref> compared the anti-inflammatory properties between Byakujutsu and Sojutsu. They found that methanol extract could inhibit the production of NO in macrophage-like RAW264.7 cells stimulated by lipopolysaccharide. The inhibitory effects of Byakujutsu on NO production were significantly higher than those of Sojutsu. This activity of 
 <italic>A. japonica</italic> rhizome was significantly higher than that of 
 <italic>A. macrocephala</italic> and 
 <italic>A. lancea</italic>. The activity of 
 <italic>A. chinensis</italic> was significantly higher than that of 
 <italic>A. lancea</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. (2016)</xref> prepared n-hexane extracts of the three species (
 <italic>A. japonica</italic>, 
 <italic>A. chinensis</italic> and 
 <italic>A. macrocephala</italic>) and evaluated their anti-inflammatory effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW 264.7 cells. Among them, 
 <italic>A. japonica</italic> most strongly inhibited NO production in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells.
