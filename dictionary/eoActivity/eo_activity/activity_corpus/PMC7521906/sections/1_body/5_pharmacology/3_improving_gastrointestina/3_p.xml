<p id="p0365">AR decoction has a curative effect on histamine-induced gastric acid hypersecretion and ulcer with a mucosal lesion as the main factor (
 <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">Piao and Piao, 1996</xref>). Intestinal epithelial (IEC-6) cells play a major role in gastrointestinal disease to accelerate wounds and mucosal ulcer healing. A recent study found that atractylenolide I (ATL-I) could promote IEC-6 cell proliferation and migration by increasing cytosolic free Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> concentration and enhancing transient receptor potential canonical 1 (TRPC1) and phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1) activity in IEC-6 cells (

 <xref rid="bib91" ref-type="bibr">Satoh et al. (2000)</xref> found that hinesol could resist gastric ulcer by inhibiting H
 <sup>+</sup>, K
 <sup>+</sup>-ATPase and Mg
 <sup>2+</sup>-ATPase and Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>-ATPase activity. AR exerted anti-gastric ulcer effect by decreasing inflammatory mediators [i.e. tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and interleukin-8 (IL-8), IL-6)] and increasing trefoil factor 2 (TFF2) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) in the rat model (
 <xref rid="bib135" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2015</xref>). A series of oligosaccharides (DP 3–15) were isolated from 
 <italic>A. lancea</italic> and identified as FOS. They could selectively stimulate the growth and/or activity of intestinal microflora and provide a health benefit to the host (
 <xref rid="bib147" ref-type="bibr">Zhuang et al., 2019</xref>). It is increasingly clear that FOS could reduce or prevent gastroenteritis, inflammatory bowel disease, reduce the risk of colon cancer, and potential pathogenic gastrointestinal bacteria (
 <xref rid="bib85" ref-type="bibr">Pöhnl et al., 2017</xref>). Atractylodiol and diacetyl-atractylodiol from 
 <italic>A. japonica</italic> could stimulate the contractility of the distal colon in rats by inhibiting nitrergic-purinergic relaxation. Atractylodin, acetylatractylodinol, atractylodinol, and 4, 6, 12- tetradecatriene-8, 10-diyne-1, 3, 14-triol from 
 <italic>A. lancea</italic> could promote delayed gastric emptying (
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Kim, 2016</xref>). These acetylenes, even though the traditional therapeutic properties cannot be entirely explained, are considered key elements for pharmacological accounts of the effects of AR that have been used to treat gastrointestinal disorders. These activities are consistent with the AR quality of natural and cultured products.
