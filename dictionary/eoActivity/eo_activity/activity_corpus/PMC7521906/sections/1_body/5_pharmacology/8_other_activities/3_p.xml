 <xref rid="tbl7" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref> , AR has been used as TCM for several thousand years, and current studies indicated that AR and some of its compounds (most of which are volatile oil) housed various biological activities. However, the in-depth molecular mechanism remains elusive. Many reports are available on sesquiterpenes, alkynes, and glycosides in AR, which are common in Compositae plants, and alkynes in safflower. They are important secondary metabolites formed by the long-term coevolution of plants and insects. Most of the main components could produce cytotoxic effects on cancer cells, especially melanoma. However, a certain gap still exists between the current pharmacological activities and its clinical uses. For instance, the role of AR in the treatment of eyesight and flaccidity-syndrome has not been explored. In addition, the existing pharmacological activity studies were mainly based on cell models and supplemented by animal models. The dosage of AR compounds with AR extracts considerably varies. Although no potential safety hazards were shown by the existing evidence using in clinical settings remain underdeveloped. In some studies, the type, weight, sex, and other factors of the animal models are not clear, and the reference value of drug doses ignoring the actual factors of experimental animals is of little value. Meanwhile, AR is traditionally used in decoction clinically, and previous studies showed that the activity of water solution and volatile oil in AR are basically the same in terms of strengthening spleen and stomach (

Therefore, the water-soluble material basis of AR must be studied for enhanced guidance on the application of AR in Chinese patent medicine. In addition, the pharmacological activity and mechanism of compound AR and the interaction of effective components need to be further studied.
