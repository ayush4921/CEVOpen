<p id="p0360">In the system of TCM, spleen deficiency plays an important role in the development of gastrointestinal dysfunction. Ancient Chinese doctors believed that AR can be used for dampness blocking, abdominal distention, and diarrhea. 
 <italic>A. japonica</italic> has been commonly used to treat the gastrointestinal (GI) disorders in Korean traditional medicine. Modern researches also found that AR could protect the intestinal tract and promote intestinal movement and has anti-diarrhea activity through anti-inflammation (
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Deng et al., 2016</xref>). AR extracts have been shown to delay gastric emptying and stimulate small intestinal motility in a dose-dependent manner. The extract (1000 mg/kg) could inhibit the intestinal dyskinesia caused by atropine, and the extract (500 mg/kg) could block the gastric emptying and intestinal dyskinesia caused by 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) (

 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Choi et al. (2011)</xref> suggested that ethyl acetate extracts of 
 <italic>A. japonica</italic> (AJEA) may specifically act on the distal colon longitudinal muscles (DCLM) among gastrointestinal smooth muscles, and AJEA-induced DCLM contraction is likely mediated, at least, by activation of ChAT and acetylcholinergic muscarinic receptors. Aqueous extract of 
 <italic>A. lancea</italic> was also shown to increase the levels of gastric hormone motilin and gastrin while decreasing the levels of somatostatin and corticotrophin-releasing factor, which results in improving the gastric emptying condition. And polyacetylenic compounds contributed to its activity (

 <italic>A. lancea</italic> delayed gastric emptying are preformed mainly via inhibition of the release of central corticotropin-releasing factor and activation of the vagal pathway, which is also involved in the release of gastrointestinal hormones such as motilin, gastrin, and somatostatin (
