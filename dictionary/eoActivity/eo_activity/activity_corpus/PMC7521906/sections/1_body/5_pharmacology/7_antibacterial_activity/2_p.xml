 <xref rid="bib129" ref-type="bibr">Yin et al. (2000)</xref> carried out a systematic multi gradient external antibacterial experiment on the extract of AR. The results showed that AR had different degrees of inhibition on 15 kinds of fungi, and the effect was stronger than that of

However, the inhibition of ampicillin and stigmasterol alone was ineffective (
