<p id="p0425">The quality evaluation of AR is obviously based on the chemical composition and relative content of volatile oil as evaluation indicators. However, the lack of non-volatile parts limited this study. From Shennong Bencao Jing, who recorded that AR is used for “long-term use of AR would get longevity” to Bencao Gangmu, who recorded that “people often burn AR to avoid evil spirits in this disease and New Year's day”. “Decocting baits” mainly used non-volatile parts, while “avoid poisonous gas” mainly used volatile oil parts. Enhancing the understanding on the quality evaluation of AR demands taking the volatile components as the index while regarding the non-volatile components. In the case of the unclear material basis of TCM, the overall effect of fingerprint is better than that of individual index components in terms of quality control. In addition, biomacromolecules play considerable roles in Chinese medicine, as their biological activities are related to TCM efficacy and their biological functions of the relationship between primary metabolism and the quality formation of TCM (
