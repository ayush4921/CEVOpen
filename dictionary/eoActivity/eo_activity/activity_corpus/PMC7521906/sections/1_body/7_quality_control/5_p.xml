<p id="p0430">Further, The blood concentrations of the pharmacodynamic substances (mainly the active ingredients) of TCMs are usually very low. How can they exert pharmacological actions, in which forms (original form, metabolite or the both) do they exert the actions? The total chemical components of multi-sources TCMs from different plants are roughly the same, but the types and contents of chemical components are often obviously different (
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2018</xref>). Is it reasonable for plants from different origins to be used as the same traditional Chinese medicine clinically? A new concept includes that the aggregate or summation of “effective forms” of pharmacodynamic substances of TCM is the core material base of the efficacy of TCM, and the “additive effect” of the blood concentrations of different “effective forms” is one part of the action mechanism (
 <xref rid="bib118" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). The “additive effect” of the different “effective forms” of a TCM means an “additive effect” of numerous constituents or/and metabolites on a same target, and therefore the efficacy brought by the addition of the concentrations of all these compounds, which differ from the “synergy effect” of multi-constituents on multi-targets and is a beneficial complement. Some constituents can be converted to each other in vivo and some metabolites are bioactive. These compounds having the similar structure are likely to have the same pharmacological effects on the same target, which could provide experimental evidence for the concept of “effective forms” and the hypothesis of “additive effect”.
