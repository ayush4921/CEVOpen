 <italic>A. japonica</italic> and 
 <italic>A. macrocephala</italic> are prescribed in the Japanese and Korean Pharmacopoeia as the botanical origin of the crude drug, Baizhu (Byakujutsu in Japanese and Baekchul in Korean). Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theory states that both groups have a similar mode of action for invigorating the spleen and eliminating dampness. However, it has been reported that the former crude drug has anti-sudorific activity and the latter exhibits diaphoretic activity (
 <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Mizukami et al., 1996</xref>), and they have been used for different clinical purposes. AR has been used as an important crude drug for the treatment of rheumatic diseases, digestive disorders, night blindness, and influenza in TCM (
 <xref rid="bib117" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et al., 2002</xref>) and was listed in Shennong Bencao Jing, the first Chinese Pharmacopoeia. In the Korean and Japanese Pharmacopoeias, the AR has been prescribed in traditional medicine as a diuretic and stomachic drugs (Kitajima et al., 2003c). In Thai traditional medicine, the main use of 
 <italic>A. lancea</italic> is for the treatment of fever and cold (Kesara et al., 2017). These ethnopharmacological uses of AR either as a single extract or as a component in herbal medicine formula are explained by its properties in eliminating dampness, invigorating spleen, and expelling wind according to the theory of TCM. However, “Zhu” medicine materials have a long history of application and have always been confused. The Latin names of AR are miscellaneous. The multiple components contained in the AR contributed to its beneficial effects including a series of sesquiterpenoids, alkynes, triterpenoids, aromatic glycosides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides (
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Jun et al., 2018a</xref>). But the available literature is not sufficient to explain its medical claims. And the corresponding structures have not been fully introduced and summarized yet. Although recent researches reveal that the extracts from AR could also exert improving gastrointestinal function, anti-tumor activity, immunomodulatory activity, anti-inflammatory activity, antibacterial activity (
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Jun et al., 2018</xref>). The findings have not yet been established links between traditional uses and modern scientific knowledge of AR. And the toxicity and safety of the chemicals have not been defined (
 <xref rid="bib145" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). On the other hand, the drugs distributed in the market have hugely varied in contents of the major essential oil compounds, posing a challenge for the cultivation of AR with constant quality (
 <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">Nishikawa et al., 1975</xref>). A systematic review of 
 <italic>A. macrocephala</italic> has been previously reported (
 <xref rid="bib145" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). This paper reviews the available recent literature on botany, traditional use, phytochemistry, pharmacological activity and its possible mechanisms, toxicity of AR with an emphasis on the biological activity and its application in TCM, quality control, and to critically analyse the reported studies. Its other possible clinical applications and future research directions also were proposed to provide a valuable and comprehensive compilation of research findings on AR to improve its medical value and use.
