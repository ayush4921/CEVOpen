<p id="p0305">A comparison of the components in the rhizomes of Chinese Atractylodes has been made by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and gas-liquid chromatography (GLC). The results were in accordance with their morphological features and pharmaceutical merits. 
 <italic>A. macrocephala</italic>, with its leaves pinnately incised, is characterized by the presence of rich atractylon and absence or lack of atractylodin. As for 
 <italic>A. lancea</italic> and 
 <italic>A. chinensis</italic> with their leaves not incised or only lobed, are characterized by high contents of atractylodin, β-eudesmol, and hinesol, but poor in atractylon (
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Fu et al., 1981</xref>). In addition, 
 <italic>A. lancea</italic>, 
 <italic>A. chinensis</italic>, and 
 <italic>A. macrocephala</italic> are the three most widely used medicinal species of the Atractylodes genus. Their similar morphological features cause disagreement as whether they are three unique species, leading to their frequent misuses in medical products (
 <xref rid="bib112" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). 
 <italic>A. macrocephala</italic> is distinguishable from other Atractylodes plants by RAPD analysis (
 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Kohjyouma et al., 1997</xref>), and the phylogenetic relationship between 
 <italic>A. lancea</italic> and 
 <italic>A. japonica</italic> is suggested to be closer than that between 
 <italic>A. japonica</italic> and 
 <italic>A. macrocephala</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Kitajima et al., 2003b</xref>). further examinated the water-soluble portion of 
 <italic>A. macrocephala</italic> to determine the chemotaxonomic relationships among them. And confirmed that the chemotaxonomic relationship between 
 <italic>A. lancea</italic> and 
 <italic>A. japonica</italic> can be considered to be close. The basic term “zhu” was the only one used when atractylodes was first recorded in the ancient Shennong Bencao Jing (ca. 100 A.D.) (
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2015</xref>); the division between these two related herb materials first occurred in the Mingyi Bielu (500 A.D.). At that time, the tuber-like rhizomes of these plants were specified as either Baizhu (bai = white) and Chizhu (chi = red), referring to the color observed in the sliced rhizomes, the red being due to spots of accumulated oils. Later, Chizhu was renamed Cangzhu (cang = gray or black), which refers to the appearance of the outer skin of the rhizome, a dark gray-black color. “Baizhu” in the Song Dynasty gradually turned into a cultivated product. After the Yuan (1271–1368 A.D.) and Ming Dynasties (1368–1644 A.D.), “Cangzhu” and “Baizhu” were divided into two herbs with different effects. After the Ming and Qing Dynasties (1636–1912 A.D.), “Mao Cangzhu” was recommended in Jiangsu province, while AM highly praised wild species in Zhejiang Province. Later it was found that this herb includes two species, 
 <italic>A. lancea</italic> and 
 <italic>A. chinensis</italic>, separately in China and people have used these together as AR (

 <italic>Atractylodes amurensis</italic> (Freyn ex Kom.) H.S.Pak, 
 <italic>Atractylodes carlinoides</italic> (Hand.-Mazz.) Kitam., 
 <italic>Atractylodes japonica</italic> Koidz. ex Kitam., 
 <italic>Atractylodes koreana</italic> (Nakai) Kitam., 
 <italic>Atractylodes lancea</italic> (Thunb.) DC., is accepted names for the plant, with more than ten synonyms. Generally, cultivated or wild 
 <italic>A. lancea</italic>, also known as Mao Cangzhu in Chinese, is mainly produced in Jiangsu, Hubei, Zhejiang, Anhui, and other places. 
 <italic>A. lancea</italic> is irregularly curved, cylindrical rhizome, 3 cm–10 cm in length and 10 mm–25 mm in diameter. The external surface is dark grayish-brown to dark yellow-brown. A transverse section reveals nearly orbicular, with pale brown to red-brown secretes as fine points. Often white cotton-like crystals are produced on its surface if 
 <italic>A. lancea</italic> stored long time with fragrant smelling and sweet tasty. 
 <italic>A. chinensis</italic> (Bei Cangzhu) is mainly produced in Hebei, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Liaoning, and other places. 
 <italic>A. chinensis</italic> is irregularly cylindrical rhizome, 4 cm–9 cm in length and 10 mm–40 mm in diameter. The external surface is black-brown to yellow-brown. The fragrance is light, pungent, and bitter (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> ) (
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Committee, 2018</xref>). Due to the different origins of 
 <italic>A. lancea</italic> and 
 <italic>A. chinensis</italic>, the leaf shapes and active ingredients are different. So it is appropriate to treat it differently and consider “Bei Cangzhu” as a variant of “Mao Cangzhu” (
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Fu et al., 1981</xref>).
