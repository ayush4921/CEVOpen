<p id="p0435">The botany, traditional uses, phytochemistry, pharmacology, toxicity, and quality control of AR have been summarized in the present review. More than 200 compounds have been isolated and identified from the herb. Among them, sesquiterpenoids, and alkynes are the major active ingredients. And improving gastrointestinal activity supported the traditional use of AR. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of sufficient research and further investigations need to be done in AR in the future. The related researches on Genus 
 <italic>Atractylodes</italic> are mainly focused on 
 <italic>A. lancea</italic> and 
 <italic>A. macrocephala</italic>. As far as their active chemical components are concerned, other species also have important value, which is also a beneficial supplement for resource utilization of 
 <italic>Atractylodes</italic>. The traditional uses of AR need to be further studied in the prevention and treatment of plague and night blindness and should be subjected to modern pharmacology to verify this idea and/or clarify its potential mechanism. The effective components, pharmacological activities, and mechanisms of TCM should be fully considered in the “effective forms”, “additive effect” and synergistic effect. We suggested that the “effective forms” and “additive effects” of the pharmacodynamic substances based on the same pharmacophore of TCM should be extensively investigated to further understand the pharmacodynamic substances and action mechanism of TCM. 
 <italic>A. lancea</italic> is expected to be one of the candidate drugs for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma. Further study on its biological activities in vivo and in vitro should be combined with toxicity study, and the appropriate dosages, models, and medication cycles should be selected according to the actual application. We should follow the quality control characteristics of TCM (integrity, processing, genuine) and combine with the clinical application, and a deep analysis of volatile oil and water-soluble components and their relationship is a must.
