<p id="p0335">Alkynes include unsaturated alcohols, ketones, acids, esters, benzene, furans and other functional groups in addition to unsaturated triple bonds and double bonds. The triple and double bonds are relatively stable, and thus they can be extracted, separated, and identified by conventional phytochemical techniques. The polyacetylenes were classified by their chemical backbones and the species of genus 
 <italic>Atractylodes</italic> where the compounds were contained were presented. The polyacetylenes of diene-diyne types were classified into furan-ring-attached, alcohol-attached, acetyl-attached, and two more functional groups-attached compounds. A part of atractylodin-related acetylenes, which contained a furan-ring at the terminal carbon, consisted of nine carbons. Among them, atractylodin was the most reported and it is contained in 
 <italic>A. lancea</italic>, 
 <italic>A. chinensis</italic>, 
 <italic>A. japonica</italic> and 
 <italic>A. koreana</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Kim, 2016</xref>). Other polyacetylenes comprised 14 carbons with double bonds at C-6 and C-12, and triple bonds at C-8 and C-10. Diacetyl atractylodiol (
 <bold>100</bold>) comprised 13 carbons and (2E, 8E)-decadiene-4,6-diyne-1,10-diol-1-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (
 <bold>101</bold>) was the only polyacetylene consisted of 10 carbons and glucosamine. However, no diene-diyne types were reported to be contained in AM (
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> , 
 <bold>86–122</bold>). As shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, most compounds of triene-diyne type polyacetylenes (
 <bold>123–162</bold>) originated from 
 <italic>A. lancea</italic> and possessed 14 carbons with triple bonds at C-4 and C-6, double bonds at C-2, C-8, and C-12. Senecioyloxy, isovaleryloxy, methylpropionyl, methylbutyryl, and acetoxy were the main functional groups of these compounds and were positioned at C-12 or C-14. Another 14 carbon polyacetylenes with triple bonds at C-8 and C-10, double bonds at C-4, C-6, and C-12. And the main functional groups were isovaleryloxy, acetoxy, methylbutyryloxy, or senecioyloxy. Monoene-diyne type polyacetylenes and their glycosides were reported to be a single double bond and two triple bonds, consisting of 9, 10, 12, and 13 carbons, with furan ring or sugars attached (
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, 
 <bold>163–175</bold>). 
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Kitajima et al. (2003b)</xref> obtained enyne-derived glycoside (
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, 
 <bold>169</bold>) from the water-soluble components of AR for the first time and determined their skeleton structure. Besides, several polyacetylenes with C10 chain alkyne, C13 chain alkyne, C14 chain alkyne, furan cycloalkyne, and thiophene cycloalkyne were isolated from 30% ethanol fraction of the n-butanol fraction of Cangzhu 80% ethanol extracts (

 <xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr">Resch et al. (1998)</xref> showed that compounds 
 <bold>184</bold> and 
 <bold>185</bold> have 5-lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase activities. 
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. (2012)</xref> revealed that compounds 
 <bold>86</bold>, 
 <bold>88</bold>–
 <bold>107</bold>, and

 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, and

 <italic>A. lancea</italic> essential oil data were first collected from the literature referring to the bioinformatic methods to study the variation rules and classify the chemotype of 
 <italic>A. lancea</italic> essential oil. Then, the essential oil among different populations or individuals in the same population was compared. (1) Large varieties in 
 <italic>A. lancea</italic> essential oil, which involved components and their content, were found among populations or even among the individuals in the same population. (2) The total essential oil and the six major components in it (elemol, atractylon, hinesol, β-eudesmol, selina-4(14), 7(11)-dienone and atractylodin) varied continuously in different geographical populations. (3) The total essential oil of 
 <italic>A. lancea</italic> decreased from South China to North China. Two chemotypes of 
 <italic>A. lancea</italic> essential oil were mainly found in China, one was Hubei chemotype (HBA), which has hinesol and β-eudesmol as the main components, with a little atractylodin and almost without atractylon and selina-4(14), 7(11)-dienone. The other type was Mt. Maoshan chemotype (MA), which is characterized by atractylon and atractylodin as main components with little hinesol, β-eudesmol and other components (
