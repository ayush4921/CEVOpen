 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Duan et al. (2008)</xref> first isolated compound (
 <bold>219</bold>) from 
 <italic>A. lancea</italic>. Some new compounds were also isolated from 
 <italic>A. lancea</italic>, including lignans, phenolic acids, and pyrazines. An intestinal immune system modulating arabino-3,6-galactan, containing shorter (AF-GN-1 and 3), and longer (AF-GN-2) oligosaccharide fractions were isolated from 
 <italic>A. lancea</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib98" ref-type="bibr">Taguchi et al., 2004</xref>). AF-GN-3 mainly contains eight oligosaccharides (oligo-1–8) and the monosaccharides (Ara and Gal). AF-GN-2 contains oligosaccharides (oligo-9–15) and small proportions of oligo-3–8. It also contains a large amount of the fraction of longer oligosaccharides. An acidic polysaccharide (ALP-3) and a neutral polysaccharide (ALP-1) were purified from 
 <italic>A. lancea</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr">Qin et al., 2019</xref>) and the results showed that ALP-1 exhibits a linear backbone composed of (2 → 1)-linked β-D-fructofuranose. The backbone of ALP-3 was elucidated as →4)-GalAp-(1 → 3, 4)-Rhap-(1→, and with branch chain substituted at O-3 position of →3, 4)-Rhap-(1 → . The branch chain consists of →3, 5)-Araf-(1→, →5)-Araf-(1→, and Araf-(1 → . A series of oligo-saccharides DP 3–15 were separated from 
 <italic>A. lancea</italic> and identified as FOS, which consisted of linear β-(2, 1)-linked fructofuranosyl units mostly carry a terminal single α-(1–2)-linked α-glucopyranosyl unit (

 <italic>A. lancea.</italic> ACPS structure can be expressed as α-D-Glcp-(1 → 2)-[β-D-Fruf-(1 → 2)-β-D-Fruf-]n-(1 → 2)-β-D-Fruf. Atractylis polysaccharide could inhibit the proliferation of human ovarian cancer, liver cancer in cellular level (
