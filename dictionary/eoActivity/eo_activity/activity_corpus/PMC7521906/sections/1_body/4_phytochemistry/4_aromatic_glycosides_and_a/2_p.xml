<p id="p0340">Naturally occurring carbohydrates with aromatic aglycones are a class of important compounds, such as antibiotics (e.g., vancomycin and chromomycin), and some plant-derived phenolic hydroxyl compounds are also glycosylated (e.g., arbutin, sennoside A, and glucoside). 
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Kitajima et al. (2003b)</xref> isolated compounds (
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> , 
 <bold>190–198</bold>) from 
 <italic>A. lancea</italic> and analyzed its structure. Some known compounds (
 <bold>201–203</bold>) of aromatic glycosides were identified from 
 <italic>A. lancea</italic> by 
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al. (2018)</xref>. 
 <italic>A. lancea</italic> also contains acyl sugar derivatives (
