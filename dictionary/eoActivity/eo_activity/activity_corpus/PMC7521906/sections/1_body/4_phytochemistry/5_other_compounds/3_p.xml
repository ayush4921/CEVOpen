<p id="p0350">Overall, more than 200 compounds have been isolated and identified from AR, and the majority of them are volatile oil. Some volatile components of AR were identified only via GC-MS alone by comparison with the databases which were only tentative identification and could not give unambiguous structures. These kinds of compounds were not listed in the tables. Transcriptomic analyses were furthermore performed via RNA-Seq to reveal the molecular mechanism regulating sesquiterpenoid formation of 
 <italic>A. lancea</italic>. A total of 857 unigenes were identified to be involved in sesquiterpenoid formation via analysis of differentially expressed genes. A putative sesquiterpenoid biosynthetic pathway was proposed, including mevalonate, 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate, sesquiterpene synthase, cytochrome P450, and the peroxisome pathway (
