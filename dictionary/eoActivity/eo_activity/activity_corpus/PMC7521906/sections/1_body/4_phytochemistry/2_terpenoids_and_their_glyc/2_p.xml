<p id="p0325">AR is rich in volatile oil and other small polar components. The reported volatile oil components were mainly identified using GC-MS. The identified compounds in eight samples accounted for 89.36%–95.79% of the total volatile oil. Sesquiterpene is the main component of relatively high boiling point in AR volatile oil, with strong aroma and biological activity. The chemical profiles of the essential oil from
