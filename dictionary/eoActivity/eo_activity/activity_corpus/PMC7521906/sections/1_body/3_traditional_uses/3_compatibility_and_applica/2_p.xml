<p id="p0315">These functions also reflected in the application of ancient herbal medicine containing AR in typhoid fever, internal and external barriers of the eyes, diarrhea, arthralgia, beriberi, and edema. Jiang et al. (2016) searched the database management system of Puji Fang, and obtained 951 pieces of AR compound, which was used for 347 kinds of diseases. The compound containing AR has the most treatments for deficiency syndromes, including tonifying asthenia and Qi, strengthening and tonifying Yuanyang, and ear asthenia. In addition, AR is mainly indicated for typhoid fever (including miscellaneous treatment of typhoid fever, moderate cold, and the common cold), internal and external barriers (including eye blindness and bird blindness), spleen and stomach weakness (including spleen and stomach deficiency and food fatigue), diarrhea, and paralysis, jaundice, cold deficiency, toothache, vomiting, cough, hemorrhoids, phlegm, spasm, bleeding, dystocia, constipation, chancre disease, rhinorrhea, endless lochia, thirst, heatstroke, and palpitation were also indicated. The indications were classified into 43 categories in total. When AR is used for treating diseases, syndromes, and symptoms, it is compatible with different herbs. It is often compatible with Phellodendri Chinensis Cortex and Coptidis Rhizoma for clearing heat and drying dampness and with Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex and Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium for fortifying the spleen and drying dampness (Zhao et al., 2019). The compatible application of AR mainly includes drying dampness and activating spleen, dispersing dampness, removing blockage, exorcising evils, relieving depression, nourishing the stomach and supplementing deficiency, and enriching the liver to brighten the eyes. AR must be used to trap the spleen with dampness (Zhuang et al., 2015). For example, Pingwei Powder comes from AR, Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex and Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium, and it is used to remove dampness and regulate Qi. In the treatment of diarrhea with dampness, AR is associated with Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium, Poria or Plantaginis Herba, and Liuyi Powders. Zingiberis Rhizoma or Cinnamomi Cortex is also added for cold-dampness. If heat is converted into dampness stagnancy, AR is combined with Paeoniae Radix Alba, Coptidis Rhizoma and Scutellariae Radix. For people who have experience dampness and evil trapped in the spleen, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. AR harmonizes the liver and spleen when combined with Paeoniae Radix Alba, Scutellariae Radix, Cinnamomi Cortex, and Saposhnikoviae Radix. AR is good at dispersing cold and dampness and benefiting the joints, especially for dampness arthralgia (Zhuang et al., 2015). AR can induce sweat and dehumidification and dispel the evil wind. It is also compatible with Notopterygii Rhizoma et Radix and Saposhnikoviae Radix, such as Nine-Ingredient Notopterygium Decoction. For example, the extracts with single AR are used to treat severe pain and joint swelling, and they can be combined with AM and Notopterygii Rhizoma et Radix; AM, Ephedrae Herba, and Cinnamomi Ramulus; or AM, Poria, and Alismatis Rhizoma. Ermiao Powder is composed of AR and Phellodendri Chinensis Cortex. It is effective in treating phlegm arthralgia, foot dampness, and leg sores. Baihu Jia Cangzhu Decoction treats damp-temperature disease with AR being compatible with Gypsum Fibrosum and Anemarrhenae Rhizoma. However, the functions of AR in eliminating filth, promoting Qi and relieving depression have not been appreciated. AR has a fragrant smell and good nature but it is not conservative. If used to prevent diseases, AR can be worn or fumigated in a medicine bag made of AR and Acori Tatarinowii Rhizoma and Artemisiae Argyi Folium. Yueju Pill is mainly made of AR, and it can invigorate the spleen. If the spleen is healthy, the other four viscera are healthy, and the melancholia resolves itself. The Chinese traditional incense consisting mainly of AR, Phellodendri Chinensis Cortex, and Artemisiae Argyi Folium has demonstrated the advantages of Chinese medicine in “avoid poisonous gas” in the prevention of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 (

The combination of AR and Poria can strengthen the spleen and stomach, promote the clearance and reduction in turbidity, regulate the acquired constitution, generate vigorous Qi and blood, nourish the viscera and limbs, and resolve the deficiency. AR can be used for the treatment of blindness, freckles, dry eyes, and other eye diseases. Ground AR and Ephedrae Herba are combined into powder, mixed with wine, and used to treat dry eyes.
