<p id="p0320">In conclusion, most of the traditional clinical functions of AR are still currently being used. However, the core viewpoints of AR dehumidification are not unified. AR is generally believed to be good at removing the dampness in upper Jiao (chest above the diaphragm, including heart, lungs, head, face), while Li Gao, the founder of “Spleen Stomach Theory” of TCM, believed that AR is an essential medicine for treating flaccidity syndrome (
 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Li, 2007</xref>). AR could rule the dampness in the three parts. If the dampness is in the upper Jiao, dampness phlegm could be easily produced to dry the dampness and conduct phlegm. If the dampness is in the middle Jiao, the stagnation of Qi is used for diarrhea, to broaden the middle Jiao and strengthen the spleen. If the dampness is in the lower part, the foot and knee are flaccid and soft. Phellodendri Chinensis Cortex, which can strengthen the foot and knee, can be used to treat this flaccidity. AR's Qi is strong and vigorous, and the effect of sweating is optimal. The effect of invigorating the middle Jiao is weaker than that of AM. However, the research on treating flaccidity by removing the dampness of the lower Jiao is insufficient. The clinical dosage of AR is also related to the difference in the diseases and types of syndrome and symptoms. Zhao et al. (2019) collected ancient books and clinical experience and concluded that the AR dosage should be 5–25 g when drying dampness, fortifying the spleen, enriching Yin and supplying Yang to treat gynecological diseases (such as infertility, polycystic ovary syndrome, and primary dysmenorrhea). It is 12–15 g when diffusing impediment and unblocking the collaterals, clearing heat, and draining dampness to treat rheumatoid arthritis and gouty arthritis.
