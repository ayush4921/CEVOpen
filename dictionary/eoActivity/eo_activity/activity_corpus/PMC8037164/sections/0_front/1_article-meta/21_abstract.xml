 <p>Following a similar approach on carvacrol-based derivatives, we investigated the synthesis and the microbiological screening against eight strains of 
  <italic>H. pylori</italic>, and the cytotoxic activity against human gastric adenocarcinoma (AGS) cells of a new series of ether compounds based on the structure of thymol. Structural analysis comprehended elemental analysis and 
  <sup>1</sup>H/
  <sup>13</sup>C/
  <sup>19</sup>F NMR spectra. The analysis of structure–activity relationships within this molecular library of 38 structurally-related compounds reported that some chemical modifications of the OH group of thymol led to broad-spectrum growth inhibition on all isolates. Preferred substitutions were benzyl groups compared to alkyl chains, and the specific presence of functional groups at 
  <italic>para</italic> position of the benzyl moiety such as 4-CN and 4-Ph endowed the most anti-
  <italic>H. pylori</italic> activity toward all the strains with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values up to 4 µg/mL. Poly-substitution on the benzyl ring was not essential. Moreover, several compounds characterized by the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration/minimum bactericidal concentration (MIC/MBC) values against 
  <italic>H. pylori</italic> were also tested in order to verify a cytotoxic effect against AGS cells with respect to 5-fluorouracil and carvacrol. Three derivatives can be considered as new lead compounds alternative to current therapy to manage 
  <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection, preventing the occurrence of severe gastric diseases. The present work confirms the possibility to use natural compounds as templates for the medicinal semi-synthesis.
