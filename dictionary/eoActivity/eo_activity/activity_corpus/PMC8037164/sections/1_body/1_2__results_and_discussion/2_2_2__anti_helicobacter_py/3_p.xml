<p>Four clinical isolates, namely F1, F40/499, F4, and F34/497, were the most sensitive to the treatment with thymol (

 <xref rid="B19-molecules-26-01829" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Similar results were obtained for carvacrol. The derivatives, functionalized at the OH moiety of the parent compound, can be clustered into two groups (alkyloxy and benzyloxy/heteroarylmethyloxy compounds) in order to extrapolate robust structure–activity relationship (SAR) within this scaffold (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-01829-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The most important information is that the OH group, as in carvacrol-based derivatives, did not seem to be essential at least to display anti-
