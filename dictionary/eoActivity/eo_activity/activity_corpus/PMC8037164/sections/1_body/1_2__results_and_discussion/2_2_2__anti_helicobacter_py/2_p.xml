<p>The phenolic terpene thymol and its 38 semi-synthetic derivatives were firstly assayed against eight strains of 
 <italic>H. pylori</italic> (one reference and seven clinical isolates). All the strains were classified according to their antimicrobial susceptibility to metronidazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin following the international EUCAST (European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing) breakpoints. Thymol, with respect to carvacrol, displayed a weaker inhibitory activity against all the strains used with MIC and MBC values ranging from 64–128 µg/mL. These results are in accordance with those reported in the literature [
