<p>For the synthesis of compounds 
 <bold>2</bold>–
 <bold>39,</bold> we employed the synthetic approach reported in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-01829-f001">Figure 1</xref>. Compounds 
 <bold>2</bold>–
 <bold>7</bold> and 
 <bold>9</bold>–
 <bold>39</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-01829-f001">Figure 1</xref>a) have been synthesized taking advantage of the Williamson etherification procedure previously employed by our group for the synthesis of carvacrol derivatives [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-26-01829" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Thymol (
 <bold>1</bold>) was reacted with the proper bromide in dry 
 <italic>N</italic>,
 <italic>N</italic>’-dimethylformamide (DMF), in the presence of anhydrous potassium carbonate (K
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub>) and under nitrogen (N
 <sub>2</sub>) atmosphere. These reactions were performed at room temperature (RT) in order to avoid the reagent degradation. For the synthesis of compound 
 <bold>8</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-01829-f001">Figure 1</xref>b) we started from compound 
 <bold>13</bold> that underwent the hydrolysis of the ethyl ester group to afford the carboxylic acid moiety. The hydrolysis was performed in mild conditions using lithium hydroxide (LiOH) monohydrate, in a mixture of water and methanol (in the ratio 50:50
 <italic>, v:v</italic>) at room temperature.
