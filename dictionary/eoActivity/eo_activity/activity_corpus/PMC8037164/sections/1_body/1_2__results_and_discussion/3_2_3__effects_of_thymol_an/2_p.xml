<p>Collectively, the functionalization of the OH moiety with an unsubstituted benzyloxy group (
 <bold>15</bold>) or a linear alkyloxy chain (
 <bold>9</bold>) was preferred in eliciting the inhibitory activity below 100 Î¼M. The substitution of the benzyl ring with NO
 <sub>2</sub>, F, and CN led to a reduction of the biological effect as well as the poly-substitution (
 <bold>26</bold> and 
 <bold>30</bold>). The change of the benzyl group with a phthalimide (
 <bold>39</bold>) was detrimental. Interestingly, compound 
 <bold>38</bold> with a 4-Ph on the benzyl ring exerted a comparable activity with respect to the parent compound.
