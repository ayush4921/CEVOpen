<p>All designed inhibitors have been analyzed by means of theoretical tools regarding the possibility to act as interfering/covalent compounds in different in vitro assays. Indeed, the analysis of substructures to elicit promiscuous pharmacological behaviour, commonly named PAINS, should be mandatory in Medicinal Chemistry for a further and proper development of such compounds in the clinical settings. Our top-rated thymol derivatives were devoid of this property. Moreover, their drug-likeness was evaluated based on the Lipinski’s rule of five, largely met by all the derivatives (for compounds 
 <bold>15</bold> and 
 <bold>38</bold>, MLOGP &gt; 4.15, which approximatively corresponds to CLogP ˃ 5, was the only violation). Log P, calculated by Moriguchi-based computer program (MLOGP), is one of the parameters that can estimate the proper absorption or permeation of a drug candidate [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-01829" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In fact, compound 
 <bold>38</bold> has also a low gastro-intestinal absorption owing to its very high MLOGP value. These features, if focused on drugs acting after oral administration specifically on the 
 <italic>H. pylori</italic>-colonized gastric mucosa, should not be considered negatively. Interestingly, as proposed by the SwissADME tool, these compounds do not display any kind of interaction with permeability glycoprotein (P-gp) that promotes the efflux of cytotoxic drugs out of the cells. This characteristic is suitable to enhance the efficacy of anti-proliferative agents, due to the involvement of this protein in the multi-drug resistance [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-01829" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The other parameters, as reported in the footnote of 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-01829-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, were used for the construction of both the boiled-egg graph and the bioavailability radar. The former allows an easy understanding and visualization of the passive absorption at the GI tract (white area) and the ability to permeate the blood brain barrier (BBB, yellow area). Only compounds 
 <bold>9</bold> and 
 <bold>15</bold> are able to be easily absorbed by the GI and provide the possibility to cross the BBB. Finally, the information obtained from the bioavailability radar graphical output suggests the drug-likeness depiction of the selected compounds including the optimal range of each physical-chemical property (flexibility, size, lipophilicity, polarity, saturation, solubility) essential to provide oral bioavailability. Collectively, these computed data are of interest for the clinical development of compounds acting as antibacterial or anti-cancer.
