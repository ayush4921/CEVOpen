<p>Among the second cluster of benzyloxy and heteroarylmethyloxy derivatives (
 <bold>15</bold>–
 <bold>39</bold>), the simplest and unsubstituted compound (
 <bold>15</bold>) was slightly more potent than thymol, but the introduction of electron-withdrawing or electron-donating substituents at different positions induced an opposite trend on the inhibitory activity. Substitutions at the 
 <italic>ortho</italic> position of the benzyl group were usually detrimental (compounds 
 <bold>16</bold>, 
 <bold>20</bold>, 
 <bold>31</bold>) except for the potent activity of compound 
 <bold>34</bold> (
 <italic>o</italic>-NO
 <sub>2</sub>) on specific strains (MIC range 4–8 µg/mL, MBC range 8–16 µg/mL). Methoxy (
 <bold>19</bold>), chloro (
 <bold>28</bold>), and nitro (
 <bold>35</bold>) at 
 <italic>meta</italic> position did not alter the anti-
 <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> activity, whereas 
 <italic>m</italic>-CF
 <sub>3</sub> (
 <bold>21</bold>) dramatically reduced it and 
 <italic>m</italic>-F (
 <bold>25</bold>) elicited it. As reported for carvacrol-based compounds, derivatives with 
 <italic>para</italic> substitution were generally more potent (
 <bold>17</bold>, 
 <bold>29</bold>, 
 <bold>32</bold>), except for 
 <bold>33</bold> and 
 <bold>36</bold>. Two derivatives (
 <bold>24</bold> and 
 <bold>38</bold>), with 4-CN and 4-Ph respectively, were endowed with the most anti-
 <italic>H. pylori</italic> activity toward all the considered strains with MIC values up to 4 µg/mL. Poly-substitution on the benzyl ring was not important (
 <bold>18</bold> and 
 <bold>23</bold>), albeit three compounds (
 <bold>26</bold>, 
 <bold>27</bold>, 
 <bold>30</bold>) slightly improved the antimicrobial activity with respect to thymol. Finally, the insertion on the OH group of thymol of a naphthalene ring (
 <bold>37</bold>) was detrimental, whereas the presence of a phthalimide nucleus (
 <bold>39</bold>) enhanced the activity. Collectively, these data suggested for all the derivatives a bactericidal mechanism of action, considering the MBC/MIC ratio to be between 1–2. This biological activity did not seem to be strictly correlated to the presence of a slightly acidic and polar phenolic OH.
