<p>The choice of such substituent was driven by the observation of a greater inhibition of microbial growth after the introduction of bulkier alkyl/benzyl groups on the hydroxyl moiety. The obtained compounds were stable at room temperature. The structures were confirmed by spectral studies (
 <sup>1</sup>H, 
 <sup>13</sup>C, and 
 <sup>19</sup>F NMR), whereas the purity of these compounds was confirmed by combustion analysis, Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) parameters and, for solid compounds, melting point.
