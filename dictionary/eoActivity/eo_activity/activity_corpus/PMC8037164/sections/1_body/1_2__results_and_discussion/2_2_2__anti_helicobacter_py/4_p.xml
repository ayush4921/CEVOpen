<p>Among the first cluster of alkyloxy derivatives (
 <bold>2</bold>–
 <bold>14</bold>), the MIC results demonstrated no or weak efficacy against all the strains as well as their parent compound, despite the presence of branched alkyl chains, unsaturations or specific functional groups (ketone, carboxylic acid, ethyl ester). Only three derivatives (
 <bold>3</bold>, 
 <bold>9</bold>, 
 <bold>12</bold>) with linear and increasing alkyl chains (Et, 
 <italic>n</italic>-Pr, 
 <italic>n</italic>-Bu) presented improved MIC values with respect to thymol against some clinical isolates (MIC/MBC = 16 µg/mL). Similar results were obtained for the aliphatic derivatives of carvacrol in our previous paper [
