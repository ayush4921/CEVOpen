<p>To better assess the dual-action behaviour of these compounds, the selection of the candidates for biological assays was guided by the anti-
 <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> activity (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-01829-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, compounds highlighted in grey). AGS cells were incubated for 24 h with the specified molecules or with 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) vehicle (control). Data shown are the means ± SD of three experiments with quintuplicate determinations (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-01829-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Thymol (
 <bold>1</bold>) showed discrete cytotoxic effects by reducing cell viability of AGS cells (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 200 ± 6.5 μM) in a dose-dependent manner, which is in accordance with literature data [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-26-01829" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It displayed a stronger cytotoxic effect at 24 h with respect to its positional isomer carvacrol (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 300 ± 6.4 μM). Out of 11 thymol derivatives, only three (
 <bold>9</bold>, 
 <bold>15</bold>, 
 <bold>38</bold>) presented a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on cell viability inferior to thymol. All of them possessed an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value higher than the reference drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU, IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 82.3 ± 5.6 μM).
