<p>Cell viability was evaluated by MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2
 <italic>H</italic>-tetrazolium)) assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The concentration ranges of thymol and its derivatives for the treatment was extrapolated from concentration-response curves built in preliminary experiments. Briefly, AGS cells were seeded in 96-well plates (6 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> cells/well) and treated for 24 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> with several concentrations (50–800 μM) of each compound (5 replica wells for each treatment condition). Cells were incubated with the MTS solution for at least 1 h and cell viability was tested colorimetrically by measuring the absorbance at 490 nm using GloMax-Multi Detection System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Cell viability was reported as the percentage as compared with the untreated cells recognized as 100%. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> value was determined from the concentration-response curves by nonlinear regression analysis [
