<p>To a stirring solution of thymol (
 <bold>1</bold>, 1.0 equiv.) in dry DMF (10 mL) was added freshly ground and anhydrous potassium carbonate (K
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub>, 1.1 equiv.) under N
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere. The suspension was stirred for 15 min at room temperature; then, the proper (un)substituted benzyl or alkyl bromide (1.5 equiv.) was added and the reaction stirred until disappearance of the starting reagents, as detected by TLC (24–72 h). Once the reaction was completed, the mixture was poured into ice-cold water (100 mL) and extracted with dichloromethane (DCM, 3 × 20 mL). The organics were collected, dried over sodium sulphate (Na
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>), and evaporated in vacuo to afford the crude mixture that was purified through silica gel column chromatography, using proper mixtures of 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane/ethyl acetate as mobile phase.
