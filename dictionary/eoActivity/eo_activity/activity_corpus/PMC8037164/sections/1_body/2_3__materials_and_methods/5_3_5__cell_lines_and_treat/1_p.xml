<p>The human adenocarcinoma gastric cell line (AGS) was derived from an untreated human adenocarcinoma of the stomach and retained the same cytological characteristics of the malignant cells obtained from Caucasian patients [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-26-01829" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The AGS cells (ECACC 89090402) were purchased from CLS Cell Lines Services GmbH (Epplheim, Germany) and cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 4.5 g/L glucose, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 10% Foetal Bovine Serum (FBS) (EuroClone S.p.A., Pero, Italy). Working solutions of thymol (

The final concentration of DMSO in experiments was 0.14%. No toxicity on AGS cells was observed (data not shown). 5-Fluorouracil and carvacrol (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) were used as positive controls.
