<p>All reactions were carried out under a positive pressure of nitrogen in washed and oven-dried glassware. All the solvents and high-purity reagents were directly used as supplied by Sigma-Aldrich (Milan, Italy) without further purification. Where mixtures of solvents are specified, the stated ratios are volume:volume. All melting points were measured on a Stuart
 <sup>®</sup> melting point apparatus SMP1 and are uncorrected (temperatures are reported in °C). Structural analysis consisted of elemental analysis and 
 <sup>1</sup>H/
 <sup>13</sup>C/
 <sup>19</sup>F NMR spectra. 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectra were recorded both at 300 MHz and 75 MHz (Varian Mercury spectrometer, Varian, Santa Clara, CA, USA), while other compounds were analysed at 400 MHz and 101 MHz on a Bruker spectrometer (Milan, Italy), using CDCl
 <sub>3</sub> and DMSO-

 <sup>19</sup>F spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE 600 spectrometer at 564.7 MHz, using CDCl
 <sub>3</sub> as the solvent. All the compounds were studied at the final concentration of ~25 mg/mL. 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13</sup>C chemical shifts are expressed as 
 <italic>δ</italic> units (parts per millions) and referenced to the residual solvent signal (CDCl

 <sup>19</sup>F chemical shifts are expressed as 
 <italic>δ</italic> units relative to an external standard (CF

 <sup>1</sup>H spectra are described as follows: 
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sub>H</sub> (spectrometer frequency, solvent): chemical shift/ppm (multiplicity, 
 <italic>J</italic>-coupling constant(s) in Hertz (Hz), number of protons, assignment). 
 <sup>13</sup>C spectra are described as follows: 
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sub>C</sub> (spectrometer frequency, solvent): chemical shift/ppm (assignment) and are fully proton decoupled. 
 <sup>19</sup>F spectra are described as follows: 
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sub>F</sub> (spectrometer frequency, solvent): chemical shift/ppm (multiplicity, 
 <italic>J</italic> coupling constant(s) in Hertz, number of fluorine, assignment) and are reported as

Multiplets are abbreviated as follows: br—broad; s—singlet; d—doublet; t—triplet; —quartet; td—triplet of doublets; m—multiplet. The exchangeable protons (OH) were assessed by the addition of deuterium oxide. The processing and analyses of the NMR data were carried out with MestreNova. Elemental analyses for C, H, and N were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer 240 B microanalyzer obtaining analytical results within ± 0.5% of the theoretical values for the final compounds. Preparative chromatography was carried out employing silica gel (high purity grade, pore size 60 Å, 230–400 mesh particle size). All the purifications and reactions were carried out by thin layer chromatography (TLC) performed on 0.2-mm-thick silica gel-aluminium backed plates (60 F254). Spot visualization was performed under short and long wavelengths (254 and 365 nm, respectively) ultra-violet irradiation. Where given, systematic compound names were generated by ChemBioDraw Ultra 14.0 following IUPAC conventions.
