<p>The MIC determination was performed by modified broth microdilution assay as previously described [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-01829" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. For MBC evaluation, 10 μL of suspensions without visible growth were spotted on Skirrow agar plates surface and incubated for 72 h at 37 °C in microaerophilic conditions and 100% humidity conditions. The MBC was defined as the concentration that killed 99.9% of the initial inoculum.
