<p>Thymol, a major natural monoterpene phenol in the essential oils of Lamiaceae and Apiaceae families, has been approved by European Union and Food and Drug Administration as a safe food additive as well as in cosmetics and agriculture industry. Among the terpenes, it has been demonstrated to be clinically relevant as an antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory agent [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-26-01829" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. As well as its regioisomer carvacrol, thymol could exert an inhibitory effect on Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, but only few studies were oriented toward 
 <italic>H. pylori</italic> [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-26-01829" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-26-01829" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], preferring the use of standardized thymol-containing plant extracts for the eradication. This Gram-negative and microaerophilic pathogen colonizes and survives in the human gastric epithelium, which represents its favourite ecological niche. About 50% of the global population is colonized by the microorganism although in most cases 
 <italic>H. pylori</italic> causes no symptoms [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-26-01829" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The survival of the microorganism as well as the recalcitrance of the infection are due to 
 <italic>H. pylori</italic> aptitude to adapt itself to the host and to develop resistance towards the antimicrobials commonly used in therapy [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-26-01829" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The resistance rate to the clinically approved drugs is increasing worldwide and most of the therapeutic failures are ascribed to adaptive mechanisms linked to the biofilm formation [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-26-01829" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], which limit the efficacy of the current therapy. The triple therapy based on the administration on proto-pump inhibitor and two antibiotics has been considered the standard therapy for many years, however, the increasing rate of triple-therapy failure was registered in many countries as well as the spreading of 
 <italic>H. pylori</italic> antibiotic resistance. In this context, novel compounds such as components of essential oils endowed with alternative mechanisms of action and the ability to disaggregate lipidic multilayer structures are strongly suggested [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-26-01829" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. More in detail, thymol derivatives have been proposed as inhibitors of CagA and VacA (cytotoxin-associated gene A and vacuolization cytotoxin) oncoproteins of 
 <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-26-01829" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and, recently, Bkhaitan et al. also prepared a thymol-metronidazole ester hybrid and assessed its discrete anti-
 <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> activity and limited cytotoxicity on normal cell lines [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-26-01829" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].
