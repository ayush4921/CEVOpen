 <italic>H. pylori</italic> is considered as a class I carcinogen by the World Health Organization and can secrete virulence factors, which not only affect host signalling pathways but can also induce a sustained gastric inflammatory process ultimately leading to the development of cancerous conditions in the stomach and duodenum [

 <xref rid="B11-molecules-26-01829" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], ascribing to this molecule the capability to induce apoptosis; cause morphological changes; generate reactive oxygen species; depolarize the potential of mitochondrial membrane; and activate Bax, caspases and PARP (Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase). It was also tested against the human gastric carcinoma cells (AGS) with contrasting biological results. Indeed, Kang et al. reported an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 400 µM after 24 h of treatment [

 <sub>50</sub> of 75.63 µM [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-26-01829" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Despite the reported values, it was evident that the cytotoxic effects on AGS cells were mediated in a concentration-dependent manner by the activation of apoptotic pathways prolonging the sub-G1 phase, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) especially at higher doses, and glutathione (GSH) depletion [
