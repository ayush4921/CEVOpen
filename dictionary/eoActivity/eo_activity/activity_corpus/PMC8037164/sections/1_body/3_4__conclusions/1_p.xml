<p>We have explored a thymol-based molecular library with large structural diversity to discover new dual-action agents characterized by the ability to reduce the growth of several strains of 
 <italic>H. pylori</italic> and to show toxicity for AGS cells. This approach allowed us to demonstrate, as also reported for carvacrol analogues, that the antibacterial activity of these phenolic terpenes is not limited to the presence of the free OH group in the natural parent compounds and that their antimicrobial potential could be enlarged by chemical modifications. Indeed, the proper functionalization could improve the anti-
 <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> activity especially against strains endowed with a different susceptibility pattern to antibiotics currently used in therapy. Moreover, some derivatives could display an antiproliferative effect useful to assess them as dual-acting agents for contrasting the development of gastric cancer. Further studies will address the potential of these compounds to treat biofilm-associated 
 <italic>H. pylori</italic> infections in vitro and in vivo due to the disaggregating ability of their parent compound [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-01829" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and the putative mechanism of action, which could be alternative to those reported in literature for the parent compound [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-01829" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Future studies will be devoted to the role of these compounds on the activity and role of carbonic anhydrase in 
 <italic>H. pylori</italic> [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-01829" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].
