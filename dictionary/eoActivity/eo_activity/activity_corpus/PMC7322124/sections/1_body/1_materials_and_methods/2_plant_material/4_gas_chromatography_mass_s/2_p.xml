<p id="p0035">Analysis of the essential oil was carried out at CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, India, using GC-MS 4000 (Varian, USA) system equipped with CP-SIL 8CB column (30 m × 0.32mm i.d., 1μm film thickness). Injector temperature was maintained at 230 °C. Oven temperature programme used was holding at 60 °C for 5 min, heating to 250 °C at 3 °C/min and keeping the temperature constant at 250 °C for 10 min. Helium was used as a carrier gas at a constant flow of 1.0 ml/min and an injection volume of 0.20 μL was employed. The MS scan parameters included electron impact ionization voltage of 70eV, a mass range of 40–500 m/z. The identification of components of the essential oil was based on comparison of their mass spectra with those of NIST05 (version 2.0) library.</p>
