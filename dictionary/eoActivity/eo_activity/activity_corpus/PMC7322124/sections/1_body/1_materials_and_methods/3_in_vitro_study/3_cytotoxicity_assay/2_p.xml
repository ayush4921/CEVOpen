Typically, 100 μL of cells suspension were plated at a density of approximate 2 ×104 cells per well in a 96-well plate, and were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humid incubator for 24 h. Different concentrations of EO were added to each group (triplicate wells) and were incubated for 24 h, followed by addition of l0 μL (5 mg/mL) of MTT dye solution to each well for 4 h. After removal of the unused MTT dye, cells were treated with 100 μL DMSO and the absorbance at 570 nm was measured using ELISA reader. The cytotoxicity was calculated relative to the control (treated with 0.1% DMSO) and expressed as the concentration of drug inhibiting cell growth by 50% (IC50). All tests were run in triplicates. Among all the screened cancer lines for cytotoxicity, and most effective cancer cell line was further selected for the mechanistic studies.
