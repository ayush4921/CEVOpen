<p id="p0055">HT-29 colon cells after treatment with different concentrations of essential oil (0.1 μL/mL) for 24h were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 min and washed with Dulbecco's PBS. The resultant cell pellet was suspended in 250 μL of lysis buffer (10mM EDTA, 50mM Tris–HCl, 0.5% SDS). Lysed cells were then supplemented with proteinase-K (500 μg/mL) at 55 °C for 1h and followed by incubation with 200 μg/mL DNAase-free RNase at 37 °C for 90 min. The DNA was extracted with 250 μL of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) for 1 min and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 min. The aqueous phase was further extracted with chloroform: isoamyl alcohol (24:1) and centrifuged. DNA was precipitated from aqueous phase with 0.1 volume of 2M NaCl and 2.5 volumes of chilled ethanol and kept at 20 °C overnight. The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min and dissolved in Tris–EDTA buffer (pH 8.0) and electrophoresed in 1.5% agarose gel at 50V for 90 min. The gel was photographed using Bio-Rad Gel documentation system (
