<p id="p0040">The antibacterial activity of EO was determined by agar well diffusion method (
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Pesavento et al., 2015</xref>). The bacterial isolates were first grown by streaking on a nutrient agar plate and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C before use. Cell suspension was prepared by dissolving loop full of culture from the culture plate in autoclaved nutrient broth. Four wells were then bored into each agar plate using a sterile 5 mm diameter cork borer and filled with 20μl solution of 1 μL/mL essential oil. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h and later observed for zones of inhibition. The effect of EO was compared with that of positive control chloramphenicol to determine the sensitivity of bacterial growth. Each sample was used in duplicate for determination of antibacterial activity.
