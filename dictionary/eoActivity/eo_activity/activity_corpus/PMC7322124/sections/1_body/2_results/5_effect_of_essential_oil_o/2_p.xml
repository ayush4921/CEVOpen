<p id="p0095">Genomic DNA fragmentation was done to elucidate the intrinsic apoptotic cell death. DNA fragmentation is a key event of apoptosis which distinguish apoptotic cells from necrotic ones. Nucleases play an important role in DNA cleavage resulting into a distinguishing ladder pattern on the agarose gel. Obtained results showed that treatment with essential oil significantly increase internucleosomal DNA cleavage in HT-29 colon cancer cells which qualitatively was observed by DNA ladder formation on agarose gel (

Lane 1 (L1) DNA ladder was not observed and intact genomic DNA appeared near the well at the top of the lanes in control (untreated) cells lane1 (L1), different concentration of the essential oil (L2) 0.1 μl/ml, (L3) 0.25 μl/ml and (L4) 0.5 μl/ml showed DNA ladder formation indicating cell death by apoptosis (
