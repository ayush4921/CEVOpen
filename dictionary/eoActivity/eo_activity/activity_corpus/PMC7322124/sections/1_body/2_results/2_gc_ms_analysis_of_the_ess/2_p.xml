<p id="p0080">The chemical composition of the EO was analyzed by GC-MS and results obtained are indicated in the chromatogram. The chemical composition of EO revealed that the majority of the detected compounds were terpenes in nature. Out of these, thymol (~50%), gamma-terpinene (~18%), and para cymene (~11%) were detected as major compounds whereas alpha pinene, alpha thujene, sabinene, beta pinene, alpha terpinene, limonene, 4-thujenol, o-isopropenyl toluene, caryophyllene, bicyclo (5.3.0) decane, 2-methylene, alpha guaiene, alpha panasinsen and caryophyllene oxide were present in relatively small amounts.</p>
