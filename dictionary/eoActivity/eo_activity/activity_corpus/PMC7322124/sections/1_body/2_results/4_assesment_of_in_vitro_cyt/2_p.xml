<p id="p0090">Colorimetric MTT assay was evaluated to elucidate the cytotoxic potential of essential oil at different concentrations (0.01–0.1 μl/ml). A dose dependent growth inhibition was observed by essential oil against human cancer cell lines with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.042 ± 0.004 μl/ml against prostate (DU-145), IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.052 ± 0.006 μl/ml against liver (HEP-2), IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.045 ± 0.002 μl/ml against neuroblastoma (IMR-32), IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.034 ± 0.001 μl/ml against colon (HT-29), IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.040 ± 0.005 μl/ml against colon (502713) and IC50 value of 0.064 ± 0.007 μl/ml against colon (SW-620) respectively (Figures 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A and 1B). However, comparatively no significant inhibitory effect was observed on the proliferation of normal monkey kidney cell line (CV-1) (IC
 <sub>50</sub>–1.92 μl/ml). Our findings indicated essential oil-induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner in all cancer cell lines.
