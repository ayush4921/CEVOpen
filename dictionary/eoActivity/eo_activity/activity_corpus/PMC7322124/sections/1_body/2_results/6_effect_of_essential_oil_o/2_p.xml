<p id="p0100">In order to understand the growth inhibitory effect of essential oil, flow cytometry was done to elucidate the DNA cell cycle analysis using PI staining method. The untreated colon HT-29 cells showed 7.69 % of cells in the sub G1 phase (

 <italic>O. viride</italic> (0.1 μl/ml), the HT-29 cell population in the sub G1 phase increased significantly up to 78.16% (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C) thereby showing more cell death in the sub G1 phase. Drug camptothecin (1μM) was used as positive control to further validate our experiment (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B). Accordingly percentage of cell in sub G1 phase has increased on treatment of cells with essential oil (
