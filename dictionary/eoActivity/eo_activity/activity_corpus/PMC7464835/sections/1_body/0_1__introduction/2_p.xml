 <italic>R. crenulata</italic> is one of the important species in the genus of 
 <italic>Rhodiola</italic>, and its rhizome has been successfully recorded by the Chinese Pharmacopoeia [

 <xref rid="B12-molecules-25-03664" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In China, 
 <italic>R. crenulata</italic> is considered as the only official species, and it has been widely recognized as the high-quality raw material for making various products, including medicine, health-preserving food and cosmetics [

 <xref rid="B14-molecules-25-03664" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Years of pharmacological studies have revealed that, the extracts of 
 <italic>R. crenulata</italic> can improve memory, adjust immune, anti-hypoxia, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, anti-tumor, resist fatigue, and have the function of dual-directional regulation in accommodating the central nervous system and endocrine system [

 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-03664" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These chemical constituents can be generally grouped into the categories of organic acids, phenyethanoids, phenols, polyphenols, terpenoids, lignans, flavonoids, flavonoids glycosides, cyanogens, and cyanophoric glycosides. Many components obtained from 
 <italic>R. crenulata</italic> have been screened for their bioactivities, and some of them had been reported to exhibit various pharmacological activities. It was found that the Kaempferol, salidroside, arbutin and rhodiolinin identified from 
 <italic>R. crenulata</italic> had excellent antioxidant capacity and could significantly improve the irradiation-induced cell apoptosis [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-25-03664" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The polyphenol compounds epicatechin-(4 beta, 8)-epicatechingallate (B2-3â€²-
 <italic>O</italic>-gallate), epicatechin gallate (ECG), and epicatechin (EC) isolated from 
 <italic>R. crenulata</italic> showed strong inhibitory activity to the maltase and sucrase [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-25-03664" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In addition, (-)-Epicatechin gallate ((-)-ECG), 1,2,3,4,6-
 <italic>O</italic>-pentagalloylglucose (PGG), rhodionin, herbacetin and rhodiosin exhibited potent inhibitory effects on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) with the median effective inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) value ranging from 2.43 to 57.50 mu g/mL [
