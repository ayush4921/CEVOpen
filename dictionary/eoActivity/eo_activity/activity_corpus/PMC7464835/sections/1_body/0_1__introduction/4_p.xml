<p>In this study, the healthy rhizomes of 
 <italic>R. crenulata</italic> were collected, and the essential oil and crude extracts of 
 <italic>R. crenulata</italic> were prepared firstly (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03664-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Then, the chemical compositions of the essential oil were preliminary determined, and the key components of the most active extract (EE) were analyzed further by the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. Moreover, the crude extracts with different polarity, the essential oil, and the compounds identified from the extract were screened for their antibacterial and antioxidant activities, which would help to reveal the material basis of the traditional use of 
 <italic>R. crenulata</italic> in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia.
