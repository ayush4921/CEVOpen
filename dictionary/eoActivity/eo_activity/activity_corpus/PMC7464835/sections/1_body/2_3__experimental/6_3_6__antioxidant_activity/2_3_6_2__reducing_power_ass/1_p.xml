<p>The measurement of reducing power was performed using the method of Demirtas [

 <xref rid="B47-molecules-25-03664" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] with slight modifications. Briefly, 25 µL of different concentrations (10–1000 µg/mL) of extracts or compounds were mixed with 25 µL of 0.2 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.6) and 25 µL of 1% potassium ferricyanide, and the mixture was incubated at 50 °C for 20 min. Then, 25 µL of 10% trichloroacetic acid and 5 µL of 1% ferric chloride were added to the mixture. The absorbance was measured at 700 nm. BHT was used as the positive control, and ethanol was the negative control. All the tests were carried out in triplicate.
