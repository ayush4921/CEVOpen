<p>The DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging assay was conducted in a 96-microplate according to the method of Wang [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-25-03664" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Briefly, 80 µL of DPPH solution (0.2 mg/mL) and 20 µL of sample solutions of different concentrations were added to each well of the microplate and mixed. Then, the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the dark. The absorbance at 515 nm was measured by a microplate spectrophotometer. The inhibition rate of free radicals was determined as (ODc-ODs)/ODc, where ODc is the absorbance of the negative control, and ODs is the absorbance of the test sample. Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) was used as the positive control. The median effective inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) value of each extract and identified compound were calculated, respectively, using a linear relation between the test sample concentration and the probability of the percentage of DPPH inhibition. All tests were run in triplicate.
