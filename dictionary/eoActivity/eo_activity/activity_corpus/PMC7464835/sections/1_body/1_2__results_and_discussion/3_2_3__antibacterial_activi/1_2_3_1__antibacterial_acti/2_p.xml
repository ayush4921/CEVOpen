<p>For the antibacterial activity of the five crude extracts of 
 <italic>R. crenulata,</italic> they showed different antibacterial capacity. Generally, CE and EE displayed good antibacterial activity. Notably, EE exhibited the strongest antibacterial activity among the five extracts, which significantly inhibited the growth of all five bacteria strains. In this test, it was also observed that the Gram-positive bacteria seemed more sensitive than the Gram-negative bacteria to the extracts. Overall, EE inhibited the visible growth of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>S. albus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. dysenteriae</italic> at the concentration of 1.25 mg/mL. In addition, the MIC value of EE to 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> was 2.5 mg/mL. And the MBC values of EE to 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>S. albus, S. dysenteriae</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> ranged from 2.5 to 10.0 mg/mL. However, the 
 <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> was shown to be less sensitive to EE, and its MBC value was not detected at the maximum concentration of 10.0 mg/mL. Additionally, CE exhibited stronger antibacterial activity than BE, and the MIC value of CE to all the tested bacteria was 2.5 mg/mL, except 
 <italic>S. dysenteriae</italic>. The MIC values of BE to 
 <italic>S. dysenteriae</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. albus</italic> were 5.0 mg/mL, 2.5 mg/mL, 2.5 mg/mL, and 2.5 mg/mL, respectively. However, it was not active to 
 <italic>S. typhimurium</italic>. The PE and WE did not show any antibacterial activity to all the test bacteria at the maximum concentration of 10.0 mg/mL. In all, the inhibitory activity of the five crude extracts against the tested bacteria was in the order of EE &gt; CE &gt; BE &gt; PE â‰ˆ WE, which was the same as the order of total phenol content. This implies that the total phenol content of extracts might closely correlate with the antibacterial activity. From these results, it could be inferred that the antibacterial properties of the crude extracts from 
 <italic>R. crenulata</italic> might confirm its popular use of treating diarrhea and scald [
