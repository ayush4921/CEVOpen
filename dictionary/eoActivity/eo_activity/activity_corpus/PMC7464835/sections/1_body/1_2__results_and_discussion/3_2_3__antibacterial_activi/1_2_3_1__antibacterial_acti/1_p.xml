<p>Antibacterial test of the essential oil and five crude extracts were conducted by micro-broth-dilution-colorimetric assay. Three Gram-negative bacteria (
 <italic>Shigella dysenteriae</italic>, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, and 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>), which usually cause severe intestinal infections, and two Gram-positive bacteria (
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. albus</italic>), which can cause pyogenic infection, were chosen as the test bacteria. As presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-03664-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, the EO of 
 <italic>R. crenulata</italic> showed moderate antibacterial activity in this study. It could inhibit the visible growth of 
 <italic>S. dysenteriae</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> at the concentration of 5.0 mg/mL. Accordingly, their minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) value was determined to be 10.0 mg/mL. However, the EO was not active to the two Gram-positive cocci, and their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value should be more than 5.0 mg/mL.
