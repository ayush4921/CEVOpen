 <p>The chemical components, as well as the antibacterial and antioxidant activities of the essential oil (EO) and crude extracts prepared from 
  <italic>Rhodiola crenulata</italic> were investigated. The essential oil was separated by hydrodistillation, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to identify its constituents. A total of twenty-seven compounds was identified from the EO, and its major components were 1-octanol (42.217%), geraniol (19.914%), and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-ol (13.151%). Solvent extraction and fractionation were applied for preparing the ethanol extract (crude extract, CE), petroleum ether extract (PE), ethyl acetate extract (EE), 
  <italic>n</italic>-butanol extract (BE), and water extract (WE). The CE, EE and BE were abundant in phenols and flavonoids, and EE had the highest total phenol and total flavonoid contents. Gallic acid, ethyl gallate, rosavin and herbacetin were identified in the EE. The antibacterial activity results showed that the EO exhibited moderate inhibitory activity to the typical clinic bacteria, and EE exhibited the strongest antibacterial activity among the five extracts. For the compounds, ethyl gallate showed the strongest inhibitory activity to the test bacteria, and its minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) value for all the tested bacteria was 0.24 mg/mL and 0.48 mg/mL, respectively. The results of antioxidant activity showed that both CE and EE exhibited strong antioxidant activities in the DPPH radical scavenging and Fe
  <sup>2+</sup> reducing power tests, however, EO showed relatively weaker antioxidant ability. Ethyl gallate and rosavin exhibited excellent activity in the DPPH radical scavenging assay, and their IC
  <sub>50</sub> value was 5.3 µg/mL and 5.9 µg/mL, respectively. Rosavin showed better reduction power activity than the other three compounds. These results could provide more evidence for the traditional use of 
  <italic>R. crenulata</italic>, and would be helpful for improving its application further.
