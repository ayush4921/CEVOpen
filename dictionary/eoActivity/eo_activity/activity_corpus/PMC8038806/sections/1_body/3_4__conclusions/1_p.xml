<p>In this work, a new antimicrobial device applying for the first time the zein protein as a gating moiety and based on MSPs loaded with essential oil components is developed for the controlled release of natural antimicrobial compounds (essential oil components (EOCs) thymol, carvacrol and cinnamaldehyde). The antimicrobial action of cinnamaldehyde encapsulated inside the microdevice against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> is demonstrated by culturability and viability assays. Indeed, the results show not only a good inhibitory effect of cinnamaldehyde when encapsulated in gated MSPs, but also the enhancement of the cinnamaldehyde bactericidal effect when compared with the corresponding free compound. The accomplishment of this microdevice is based on the proteolytic secretion by bacteria acting as a triggering stimulus that allows the sustained release of the entrapped EOCs. In this way, the developed microdevice improves the antimicrobial properties of an essential oil component by decreasing its volatility and, hence, by increasing its local concentration. The developed antimicrobial system based on the combination of food grade molecules and a biocompatible support might be used as a new preservative in the food industry.
