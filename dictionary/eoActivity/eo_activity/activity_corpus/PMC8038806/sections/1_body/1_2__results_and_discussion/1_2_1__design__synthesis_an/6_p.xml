<p>To determine the EOC payload content in M41–EOC–Z, DMSO cargo extraction was performed. This procedure allowed determining the payload within the different supports (μg EOC/mg M41–EOC–Z) and the obtained values are shown in 
 <xref rid="ijms-22-03795-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. As can be seen, the encapsulation efficiency of the M41–Cin–Z solid was greater than that obtained with the other employed EOCs, i.e., Thy and Car.
