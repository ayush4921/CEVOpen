<p>To confirm the ability of the zein protein to also regulate the EOC payload delivery from M41–EOC–Z, release assays were carried out with the three synthesized materials, M41–Thy–Z, M41–Car–Z and M41–Cin–Z, following the procedure included in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot7-ijms-22-03795">Section 3.7</xref>. As it can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-03795-f006">Figure 6</xref>, the highest release is obtained with the Cin solid and, although an initial release both in the absence and in the presence of the pronase was measured, the release of the M41–Cin–Z solid in the absence of the proteases was kept at a low basal level during the 24 h of the experiment.
