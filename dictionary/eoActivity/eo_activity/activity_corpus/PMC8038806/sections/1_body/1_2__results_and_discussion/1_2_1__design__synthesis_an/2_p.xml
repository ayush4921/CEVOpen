<p>The synthesized solids were characterized using standard techniques. Normalized X-ray patterns of all the solids (MCM-41 “as made”, calcined M41, M41–RhB–Z, M41–Thy–Z, M41–Car–Z and M41–Cin–Z) are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-03795-f001">Figure 1</xref>a. The diffractogram of the MCM-41 “as made” shows four low-angle peaks characteristic of a hexagonal pore arrangement. The peaks were indexed from left to right as (1 0 0), (1 1 0), (2 0 0) and (2 1 0) Bragg reflections, respectively. After calcination, a notable shift towards higher 2θ values compared with the “as made” material can be observed. This phenomenon is related with cell contraction due to the condensation of silanol groups in the calcination process. It can also be appreciated that the reflections (1 1 0), (2 0 0) and (2 1 0) almost disappeared in the curves corresponding to the gated solids. This fact is due to the large amount of organic matter contained in the final solids, which causes partial loss of the structural order. However, the clear presence of the (1 0 0) peak in all the diffractograms demonstrates that neither the calcination nor the loading and functionalization processes modify the mesoporous structure.
