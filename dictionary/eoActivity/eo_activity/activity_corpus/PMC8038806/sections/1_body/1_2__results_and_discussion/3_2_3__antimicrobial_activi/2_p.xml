<p>All free EOCs were able to completely inhibit bacterial growth in the tested concentration ranges (50–250 μg/mL for Thy and Car and 125–1000 μg/mL for Cin), specifically, the MBC obtained for the free EOCs was found to be in the following concentration ranges: 100–150 μg/mL for Thy, 150–200 μg/mL for Car and 250–500 μg/mL for Cin. These results are in agreement with the data previously described in the literature, where the studied EOCs were reported to have MBC values against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> of 240–300.5 μg/mL for Thy, 244.2–366.4 μg/mL for Car and 262.5 μg/mL for Cin [
