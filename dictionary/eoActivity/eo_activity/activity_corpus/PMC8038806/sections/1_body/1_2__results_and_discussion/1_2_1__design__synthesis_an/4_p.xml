<p>The N
 <sub>2</sub> adsorption-desorption isotherms of the calcined support (M41) are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-03795-f002">Figure 2</xref>a. A typical curve for this mesoporous solid consisting of an adsorption step in the interval of P/P
 <sub>0</sub> values between 0.1–0.3 can be observed. The curve fits with type IV isotherm, in which the increase produced in gas absorption corresponds to condensation of N
 <sub>2</sub> molecules within the mesopores of the inorganic structure [
 <xref rid="B50-ijms-22-03795" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The absence of the hysteresis loop in this interval and the narrow BJH distribution of pore diameters (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-03795-f002">Figure 2</xref>b) suggest the existence of uniformly cylindric mesopores in which gas adsorption and desorption processes are carried out by the same mechanisms. The N
 <sub>2</sub> adsorption-desorption isotherm of M41–RhB–Z solid is typical of mesoporous systems with practically filled mesopores (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-03795-f002">Figure 2</xref>a). The high amount of organic matter in the solid prevents the adsorption of gas molecules, so the registered curve is completely flat when compared with the one of the empty starting material. Consequently, the absence of appreciable mesoporosity is observed (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-03795-f002">Figure 2</xref>c), and a relatively low quantity of adsorbed N
 <sub>2</sub> and low surface area (see 
 <xref rid="ijms-22-03795-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) were obtained. Solids containing EOCs loaded into the pores could not be analyzed by this technique due to the previous degassing process under high vacuum and high temperature applied to the samples that would extract the encapsulated molecules.
