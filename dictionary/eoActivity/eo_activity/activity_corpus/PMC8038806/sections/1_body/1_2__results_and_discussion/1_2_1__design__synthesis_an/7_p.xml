<p>The differences in cargo loading efficiency may be due to the different structure of the studied molecules. The three-dimensional structure of the loaded EOCs is evidenced by the MM2 energy-minimized ChemDraw 3D model shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-03795-f004">Figure 4</xref>. As it can be seen in this Figure, Thy and Car molecules are isomers with notably higher steric hindrance than the Cin molecule, which is flat. This flat structure in aromatic compounds favors π–π interactions, which permits the accommodation of a greater number of molecules in a given space and might explain the larger loading of Cin in comparison with Thy and Car.
