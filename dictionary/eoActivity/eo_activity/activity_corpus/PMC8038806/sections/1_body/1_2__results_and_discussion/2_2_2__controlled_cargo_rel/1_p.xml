<p>Release assays were carried out with M41–RhB–Z to confirm the mechanism of the protein-gated support to modulate cargo release in the presence of proteolytic enzymes in the medium. Delivery studies from M41–RhB–Z were performed in H
 <sub>2</sub>O at pH 8 in the absence and in the presence of the pronase, a generic cocktail of proteolytic enzymes. As it can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-03795-f005">Figure 5</xref>, the cargo released from the system when no proteolytic enzymes were present was relatively low compared to the cargo delivered in the presence of the pronase. This confirms that cargo delivery of the chosen dye is hindered by the zein protein anchored to the surface of the mesoporous silica particles while the presence of proteolytic enzymes favors the sustained release of the entrapped molecule over time.
