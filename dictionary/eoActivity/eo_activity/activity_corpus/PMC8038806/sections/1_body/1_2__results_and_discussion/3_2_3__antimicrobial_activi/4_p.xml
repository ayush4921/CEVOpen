This circumstance might be explained by the fact that the payload released by these gated microdevices is below or very close to the MBC of the corresponding free compound. In contrast, the cinnamaldehyde-loaded solid showed a clear bactericidal effect, achieving the maximum effect at a particle concentration of 8 mg/mL, which corresponds to a Cin payload of 113 μg/mL. The Figure also shows that the M41–Cin–Z solid was able to significantly decrease the microbial population to a concentration as low as 4 mg/mL, which corresponds to a Cin payload of 50 μg/mL. These results indicate that the M41–Cin–Z system is not only better than the other studied M41–EOC–Z, but also has a greater bactericidal effect than free Cin. The MBC of the M41–Cin–Z system falls within the 56–113 μg of the Cin/mL range. This concentration is much lower than the MBC of free Cin, which, as stated before, was in the 250–500 μg/mL range. This MBC value obtained is also much lower than those reported in other previous works in which this compound was tested against different microorganisms [

 <xref rid="B56-ijms-22-03795" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. This MBC improvement can be related to the advantages offered by encapsulation and active release of this volatile compound from gated MSP systems. In this way, the design proposed for this microdevice allows the local concentration of EOCs to be increased and prevents its evaporation from the medium, achieving the same antimicrobial effect with a lower active compound concentration.
