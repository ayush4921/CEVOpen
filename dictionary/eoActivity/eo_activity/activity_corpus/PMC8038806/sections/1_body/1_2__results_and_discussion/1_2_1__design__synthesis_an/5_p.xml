<p>The different stages of the synthesis process were followed by the ζ potential. The obtained values are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-03795-f003">Figure 3</xref>. As it can be observed, a starting negative ζ value was obtained for the bare material (M41), which is related to the deprotonated silanol groups on the particle’s surface. The negative charge of M41 particles was maintained after loading with Thy and Car. A remarkable fact was the slightly positive value of the M41–Cin solid, possibly due to the formation of hemiacetal groups between the aldehyde of Cin and the silanolate groups on the MSP surface, which compensates for the negative charge on the M41 surface. This process did not occur with the other two EOCs (Thy and Car) since their active groups are alcohols, which do not react with silanolates. The hemiacetal formation is a pH-dependent reversible phenomenon [
 <xref rid="B51-ijms-22-03795" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], so the interaction of Cin with silanolates can be reverted when APTES is added. APTES-functionalization occurred effectively as is seen in the value of the ζ potential reached by M41–Cin–N which is comparable to the other M41–EOC–N values. Finally, only small changes in the ζ potential values were observed when the zein protein was attached to the external surface of the particles.
