<p>Beside plate counting results, the bacterial viability of the cells treated with the free and encapsulated Cin was analyzed with a two-color fluorescent LIVE/DEAD
 <sup>®</sup>
 <italic>Bac</italic>Light™ kit in order to visualize the remaining viable cells (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot8dot2-ijms-22-03795">Section 3.8.2</xref> for details). As an outline of the kit’s performance, living cells become green-stained and dead bacteria that remain physically intact in the medium are red-stained, thus allowing qualitatively visualizing cell viability. With this aim, cells incubated under different conditions (without treatment (positive control), with unloaded M41–Z particles (negative control), with free Cin and with M41–Cin–Z) were stained with the aforementioned kit (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot8dot2-ijms-22-03795">Section 3.8.2</xref> for details). Afterwards, fluorescence microscopy images were obtained. The resulting micrographs are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-03795-f008">Figure 8</xref>. As it can be seen, there was no difference between positive (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-03795-f008">Figure 8</xref>a) and negative controls (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-03795-f008">Figure 8</xref>b) with regard to the 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> viability (green cells). In contrast, the number of living cells (shown in green color) was practically reduced to zero when free Cin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-03795-f008">Figure 8</xref>c) or M41–Cin–Z (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-03795-f008">Figure 8</xref>d) was added to the medium at the tested concentrations. The absence of red-stained cells is related to the absence of intact dead cells. This suggests cell envelope disruption and leakage of intracellular content resulting in the loss of cellular structure and the inability of the red fluorophore to stain these cells. These results are in accordance with the previous studies using essential oil components as antimicrobials [
