<p>The design of smart delivery systems is based on three components: (i) a porous support, (ii) bioactive compounds with antimicrobial properties and (iii) a biomolecule as a molecular gate or gatekeeper. MCM-41 mesoporous silica material was selected as inorganic support due to its loading capacity and easy-to-functionalize surface [

Following this approach, three materials were prepared (M41–EOC–Z solids), all of them using mesoporous silica microparticles loaded with three different EOCs (i.e., Thy, Car and Cin) and capped with the zein protein (

The first step consisted in loading the mesoporous material with the EOC by vapor adsorption. Next, the functionalization of the silica surface with the linker APTES was performed. Finally the link of the zein protein to the particle’s surface via the formation of amide bonds with the APTES amine was established (
