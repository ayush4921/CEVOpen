<p>The expected porous structure of the starting M41 solid was also confirmed through TEM micrographs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-03795-f001">Figure 1</xref>b). In these images, the typical matrix of the MCM-41 material composed of narrow channels with hexagonal arrangement can be appreciated. This structure is visualized as alternating white and black stripes, and the pore stacking is visible when the pores are seen frontally in the image. Comparing the images of the final solids (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-03795-f001">Figure 1</xref>b(
 <italic>ii</italic>â€“
 <italic>v</italic>)) with the M41 one (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-03795-f001">Figure 1</xref>b(
 <italic>i</italic>)), it is possible to see structure preservation after the loading and functionalization processes even despite the loss of contrast in the images due to the presence of organic matter.
