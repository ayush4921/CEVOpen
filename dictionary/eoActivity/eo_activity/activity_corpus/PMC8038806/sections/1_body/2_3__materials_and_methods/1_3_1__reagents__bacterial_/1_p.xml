 <italic>N</italic>′-ethylcarbodiimide (EDC), trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), rhodamine B (RhB), thymol (Thy), carvacrol (Car) and cinnamaldehyde (Cin) were provided by Sigma-Aldrich (Sigma-Aldrich Química S.L., Madrid, Spain). Alpha-zein (corn protein) (zein), ethanol (extra pure), methanol (MeOH), acetonitrile (ACN), hexane and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were purchased from Scharlab (Barcelona, Spain). 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> K12 (CECT 433) was obtained from the Spanish Type Culture Collection (CECT, Burjassot, Spain). The bacterial strain was reconstituted according to the CECT instructions. After that, the bacterial stock was maintained at 4 °C in a plate count agar before its use. 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> inoculum was prepared by placing one single colony of the 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> strain into 10 mL of tryptic soy broth (TSB). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 24 h in order to obtain an inoculum with a density of approximately 10
 <sup>8</sup> cells/mL of broth. All culture media were supplied by Scharlab S.A. (Barcelona, Spain).
