<p>The minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of the antimicrobial compounds was obtained using the macrodilution method [
 <xref rid="B62-ijms-22-03795" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The MBC was defined as the lowest concentration of the antimicrobial compound that would kill 99.9% of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> cells. The antimicrobial assay was performed in a liquid medium to allow the contact between bacteria and the free or encapsulated antimicrobials during incubation, followed by plating to enumerate the remaining viable colony-forming units (CFUs). Different compound concentrations were prepared in Erlenmeyer flasks with 15 mL of TSB for each free EOC in accordance with previous studies considering the obtained MBC values in those works [
 <xref rid="B52-ijms-22-03795" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="B53-ijms-22-03795" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The tested concentrations were 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250 μg/mL for Thy and Car and 125, 250, 500, 750 and 1000 μg/mL for Cin. Then, Erlenmeyer flasks, including the controls containing only the TSB medium, were inoculated with 10 µL of the 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> suspension to obtain a final concentration of 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/mL. Finally, all the flasks were incubated with orbital stirring (150 rpm) at 37 °C for 24 h. In order to enumerate the viable cells after the antimicrobial treatment, decimal serial dilutions were prepared in sterile distilled water and 100-µL aliquots thereof were spread on Tryptone Bile X-glucuronide (TBX) plates. After plate incubation at 37 °C for 24 h, the colonies were counted, and the obtained results were expressed as log CFU/mL. To perform the M41–EOC–Z antimicrobial assays, the synthesized particles were added directly to the TSB contained in the Erlenmeyer flasks to obtain suspensions of each M41–EOC–Z microdevice at concentrations of 0, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 mg/mL, and the subsequent procedure was the same as that followed for free antimicrobials (vide supra). Positive controls, where the 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> inoculum was allowed to grow without alterations, and negative controls, where the non-treating system M41–Z was added at the maximum particle concentration (12 mg/mL), were also performed. All the treatments (which include controls, free EOCs and M41–EOC–Z microdevices) were tested in triplicate.
