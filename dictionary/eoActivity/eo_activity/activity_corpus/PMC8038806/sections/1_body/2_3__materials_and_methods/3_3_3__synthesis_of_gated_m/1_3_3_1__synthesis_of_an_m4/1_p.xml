<p>RhB was encapsulated into M41 microparticles by the immersion method following a similar loading procedure to the one carried out in previous works [
 <xref rid="B61-ijms-22-03795" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. With that purpose, 1 g of M41 was added to a solution of RhB (0.8 mmol in 40 mL of H
 <sub>2</sub>O) and stirred for 24 h. The mixture was filtered and the resulting solid, M41–RhB, was dried under vacuum. Once M41 was loaded with RhB, the surface of the support was functionalized with the zein protein. For the protein bonding, previous surface functionalization with APTES as a linker between the protein and the MSP–silanol groups was necessary. Functionalization was performed by adding 8 mL APTES to a suspension of 1.2 g of the loaded solid in 25 mL of H
 <sub>2</sub>O. The mixture was stirred for 5.5 h at room temperature. The resulting APTES-functionalized particles (M41–RhB–N) were collected by centrifugation and dried under vacuum. Finally, the binding of zein (corn protein) on the surface of M41–RhB–N was performed through a covalent amide bond between carboxylate moieties in the protein and amino groups from APTES following similar protocols to those described in the literature with slight modifications [

 <sub>2</sub>O and 200 mg of EDC was prepared and stirred for 30 min. Then, 700 mg of M41–RhB–N were added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. The final solid was collected by centrifugation and washed three times with mixtures of ethanol/water gradually increasing the proportion of water. Finally, the protein-functionalized solid (M41–RhB–Z) was dried under vacuum.
