<p>To determine the payload content in M41–EOC–Z microdevices, a DMSO extraction process was performed. For this purpose, 2 mg of the corresponding solid were suspended in 2 mL of DMSO and the mixture was kept under stirring for 24 h. After that, the EOC payload released was quantified by measuring the absorbance of the sample at 280 nm.</p>
