<p>For the EOCs’ cargo release experiment, 1 mg of each of the final solids (M41–EOC–Z) was placed in 1 mL of H
 <sub>2</sub>O at pH 8, and the other 1 mg of M41–EOC–Z was placed in 1 mL of a pronase enzyme solution (0.12 mg/mL of pronase in H
 <sub>2</sub>O at pH 8). At certain times, aliquots were taken and the amount of EOC released was quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in the case of carvacrol and by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) in the case of thymol and cinnamaldehyde.
