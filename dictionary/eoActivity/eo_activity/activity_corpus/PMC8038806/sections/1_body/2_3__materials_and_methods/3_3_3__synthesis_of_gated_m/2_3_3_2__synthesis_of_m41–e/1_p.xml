<p>Three different EOCs, thymol, carvacrol and cinnamaldehyde (Thy, Car and Cin, respectively), were loaded into the mesoporous material by steam adsorption by mixing 250 mg of M41 solids and 250 mg of each EOC in a perfectly closed vial. The mixtures were shaken at 40 °C for 24 h until the added amount of EOC was completely adsorbed and the solids (i.e., M41–EOC: M41–Thy, M41–Car and M41–Cin, respectively) looked completely dry. Once M41 was loaded with the different cargo molecules, the surface of the support was functionalized with the zein protein following a similar procedure as described above. In a typical procedure, 8 mL APTES was added to a suspension of 1.2 g of the loaded solid in 25 mL of H
 <sub>2</sub>O. The mixture was stirred for 5.5 h at room temperature. The resulting APTES-functionalized particles (M41–EOC–N) were collected by centrifugation and dried under vacuum. A suspension of 1 g of zein in 30 mL of H
 <sub>2</sub>O and 200 mg of EDC was prepared and stirred for 30 min. Then, 700 mg of M41–EOC–N were added to the mixture and stirred at room temperature overnight. The final solids were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with mixtures of ethanol/water gradually increasing the proportion of water. Finally, the protein-functionalized solids (M41–EOC–Z: M41–Thy–Z, M41–Car–Z and M41–Cin–Z) were dried under vacuum.
