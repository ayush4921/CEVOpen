<p>For the cargo release experiment, 5 mg of the final solid (M41–RhB–Z) were placed in 10 mL of H
 <sub>2</sub>O at pH 8, and the other 5 mg of M41–RhB–Z were placed in 10 mL of a pronase enzyme solution (0.12 mg/mL of pronase in H
 <sub>2</sub>O at pH 8). At certain times, aliquots were taken and filtered. The RhB delivery from the pore voids to both solutions was quantified via the fluorescence emission band of this molecule at 572 nm (excitation at 555 nm). The release assay was performed in triplicate.
