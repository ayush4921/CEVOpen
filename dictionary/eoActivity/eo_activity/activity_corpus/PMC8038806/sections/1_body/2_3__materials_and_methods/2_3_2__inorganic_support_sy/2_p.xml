<p>For the microparticle synthesis, 0.49 g of NaOH were added to 25.79 g of TEAH
 <sub>3</sub> and the mixture was heated to 120 °C in order to evaporate the ethanol generated in the condensation reaction. Then, the mixture was cooled to 70 °C. TEOS in the amount of 11 mL was added dropwise and the mixture was heated again to 120 °C while stirring. Once the temperature was reached, 4.68 g of CTAB were added, and the mixture was cooled again to 70 °C. Finally, 80 mL of distilled H
 <sub>2</sub>O were added, and the mother liquor was stirred vigorously for 1 h at room temperature. The final mixture was transferred to a Teflon flask and kept at 100 °C for 24 h. After that, the suspension was filtered under vacuum and washed until neutral pH. The material was dried and finally calcined at 550 °C to completely remove the surfactant molecules that conformed the nanotubular template. Following this procedure, the final MCM-41 microparticles, bare and unloaded (M41 solid), were obtained.
