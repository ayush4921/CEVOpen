 <sub>2</sub> adsorption–desorption isotherms, ζ potential, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and fluorescence spectroscopy were used to characterize the synthesized solids. PXRD was performed on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer (Bruker, Coventry, UK) using Cu Kα radiation. TEM images were obtained with a JEOL JEM-1010 (JEOL Europe SAS, Croissy-sur-Seine, France). N
 <sub>2</sub> adsorption–desorption isotherms were recorded with a Micromeritics TriStar II Plus automated analyzer (Micromeritics Instrument Corporation, Norcross, GA, USA). Inorganic samples were degassed at 120 °C in vacuum overnight. Samples with organic content were degassed at 70 °C overnight. The specific surface areas were calculated from the adsorption data in the low pressure range using the BET (Brunauer Emmett Teller) model. Pore size was determined following the BJH (Barclay James Harvest) method. To determine the ζ potential of all the solids, Zetasizer Nano ZS equipment (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK) was used. Samples were dispersed in distilled water at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. Before measuring, each sample was sonicated for 5 min to preclude aggregation. The particle mobility values were used to calculate ζ values by applying the Smoluchowski model. Each sample was measured in triplicate at 25 °C, performing three recordings per measurement. The average of the nine obtained values was reported as the ζ potential, and error bars represent the standard deviation value. Fluorescence spectroscopy measurements were performed with a JASCO FP-8300 spectrofluorometer (JASCO, Easton, PA, USA).
