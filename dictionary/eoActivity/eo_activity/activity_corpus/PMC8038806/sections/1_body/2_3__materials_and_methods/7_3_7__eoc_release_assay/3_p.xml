<p>In the case of the Thy and Cin cargo release experiment, each of the collected aliquots was shaken with 1 mL of hexane to extract the corresponding EOC and perform its quantification by GC–MS. Then, 2 μL of each extracted sample were directly introduced into the injector. The analysis was performed in a 6890/5975 inert GC–MS (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with an HP-5 fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm). Helium gas (ultrahigh purity grade, 99.999%) was used as the carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 1 mL/min. The oven temperature was programmed initially at 60 °C for 3 min with a following ramp from 60 to 100 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min; the oven temperature was then further increased to 140 °C at 5 °C/min and finally increased again to 240 °C at a rate of 20 °C/min; the hold time was 27 min. The injector and MS transfer line temperatures were set at 250 °C and 230 °C, respectively. The MS analysis parameters were the electron ionization (EI) source, electron energy of 70 eV, solvent delay of 3 min and m/z of 40–550 amu. Thy and Cin were identified according to their retention index and by matching mass spectra with the standard mass spectra from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) MS Search 2.0 library. In order to develop calibration methodology for our study, Thy and Cin main peak areas from GC–MS were plotted as a function of the concentration of Thy and Cin in hexane (from 5 to 250 μg/mL). A linear trend was observed.</p>
