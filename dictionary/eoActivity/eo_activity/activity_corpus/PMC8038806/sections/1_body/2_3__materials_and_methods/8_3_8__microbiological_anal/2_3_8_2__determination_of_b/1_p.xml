<p>To develop this experiment, suspensions of bacteria-inoculated TSB with a final concentration of 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/mL were prepared and incubated under different conditions for 5 h. The studied conditions included bacteria treated with free Cin (400 μg/mL) or M41–Cin–Z (4 mg/mL) and also positive and negative controls (non-treated bacteria or bacteria treated with 4 mg/mL M41–Z, respectively). Treatment concentrations were chosen based on the microbial count results (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot8dot1-ijms-22-03795">Section 3.8.1</xref>) with the aim of testing concentrations where both live and dead cells could be visualized in the same sample. The cells in each suspension were stained with a two-color fluorescent kit, LIVE/DEAD
 <sup>®</sup> BacLight™ (Invitrogen, ThermoFisher Scientific, Renfrew, UK), used for visualizing the viable and remaining dead bacteria according to membrane cell integrity. The two-color kit is composed of SYTO 9 (green fluorescent nucleic acid stain) that labels all the microbial cells with either intact or damaged membranes and propidium iodide (red fluorescent nucleic acid stain) that passes only across damaged membranes, so it labels only the dead cells that remain present in the media. Propidium iodide reduces SYTO 9 fluorescence when both dyes coexist in the same cell, resulting in red labelling. This results in a green/red labeling of the living/dead cells, respectively. For that, 0.8 μL of the aforementioned kit (SYTO 9 and propidium iodide mixed at a ratio 1:1) were added to 500 μL of each studied suspension. The mixture was incubated in the dark for 10 min to allow the penetration of dyes. Then, 5 μL of stained cells were placed over poly-L-lysine-covered slides (Sigma-Aldrich, Madrid, Spain) and sealed with a coverslip. The samples were finally observed under a Motic BA310E trinocular microscope equipped with an Epi-Led module with a 3W Led 470 nm illuminator bulb, MB barrier filter (AT480/30×, AT505DC and AT515LP fluorescence filters) and a Moticam 3+ camera. The obtained fluorescence images were acquired on a dark field with a 100× objective and have a pixel size of 0.156 µm (64 px = 10 µm).
