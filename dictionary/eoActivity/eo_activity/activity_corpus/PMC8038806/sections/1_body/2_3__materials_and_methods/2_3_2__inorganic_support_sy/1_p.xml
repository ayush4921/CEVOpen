<p>The synthesis of the mesoporous material was performed according to the protocol described by Bernardos et al. [
 <xref rid="B59-ijms-22-03795" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The synthesis process was carried out following the “atrane route” [
 <xref rid="B60-ijms-22-03795" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] in which the structure-directing agent is composed of an intermediate species between CTAB and TEAH
 <sub>3</sub>. The molar ratio between the reagents was as follows: 7 TEAH
 <sub>3</sub>: 2 TEOS: 0.52 CTAB: 0.5 NaOH: 180 H
 <sub>2</sub>O.
