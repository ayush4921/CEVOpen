<p>To perform Car release experiments, the collected aliquots were centrifuged to remove the suspended microparticles. The proteins present in the supernatants were precipitated with MeOH (1 mL) at −14 °C, and the mixture was then centrifuged. Car delivery from M41–Car–Z to the supernatant solution was analyzed by HPLC with a Novapack C18 column (Waters Alliance
 <sup>®</sup> e2695, Milford, MA, USA). The mobile phase used was ACN:H
 <sub>2</sub>O (50:50 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) with 0.05% of TFA and the absorbance detector used the fluorescence wavelength (λex) of 280 nm. Two hundred mL were injected and a flow of 1 mL/min was fixed. The methods were previously validated showing adequate linearity, precision and accuracy (R &gt; 0.99 and coefficient of variation &lt;5%).
