<p>Additionally, a solid without loaded molecules but gated with the zein protein (M41–Z) was synthesized and used as the negative control in the microbiological tests. For this purpose, 500 mg of M41 were functionalized with APTES (3 mL) as described above obtaining the M41–N solid. The final unloaded gated system, M41–Z, was obtained by binding the zein protein (150 mg) to the amino-terminal groups in M41–N (50 mg) following the same procedure as previously described.</p>
