<p>The worldwide evolution of antimicrobial resistance, in addition to the scarcity of novel antibiotic medications, represents a serious public health concern. That means the go-back to a preantibiotic epoch in which infectious diseases caused by multiple-resistant microbial pathogens are uncontrollable [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. It is well documented that EOs displayed a comparable antimicrobial effect against the tested antibiotic-resistant and antibiotic-susceptible strains; therefore, it could be presumed that the EOs mechanism of action is unlike that from the used antibacterial and antifungal drugs [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The antimicrobial activity of the EO extracted from 
 <italic>G. curviflora</italic> leaves and flowers was assessed using broth microdilution assay. The results revealed that the EO affected all screened bacterial and fungal strains. It displayed potent activity against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> with a MIC dose of 1.25 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL compared with the positive controls ampicillin and ciprofloxacin, which have MIC values of 25 and 3.12 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, respectively. 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is a Gram-negative bacterium that can cause infection in the respiratory system, urinary tract, wounds, and burns. Furthermore, it can give rise to blood infections causing a series of virulent infectious diseases including diffuse bronchopneumonia, cystic fibrosis, non-CF bronchiectasis, urinary tract catheterization, ecthyma gangrenosum, septic shock, hemorrhage, and necrosis.
