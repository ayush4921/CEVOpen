<p>The 
 <italic>G. curviflora</italic> EO displayed twofold greater antibacterial activity than that of Ampicillin (positive control) against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> with MIC values of 3.12 and 6.25 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, respectively. On the other hand, it showed twofold weaker anti-MRSA activity than that of ciprofloxacin with MIC values of 25 and 12.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, respectively. Moreover, it exhibited potent anti-
 <italic>E. coli</italic> activity comparing with ciprofloxacin with MIC values of 1.25 and 0.78 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, respectively. It showed 1.2-fold lower antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>S. sonnei</italic> as compared with that of ciprofloxacin with MIC values of 14 and 12.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, respectively. The EO revealed anti-
 <italic>Candida</italic> and antimold activities with MIC values of 6.25 and 3.125 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL as compared with the most potent antifungal drug (fluconazole), which has a MIC dose of 3.12 and 0.66 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, respectively. 
 <italic>G. curviflora</italic> EO displayed powerful activity against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa, S. sonnei, E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and MRSA. Our results can be compared with the data reported by Zomorodian et al. on the same strains [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. They reported that the EO of 
 <italic>N. cataria</italic> displayed a powerful antibacterial activity against Methicillin-Resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. sonnei</italic> with MIC values of 0.22 and 2 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/mL, respectively. Furthermore, a study conducted by Shakeri et al. revealed that EO possesses antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> with MIC values of 150 and 14 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, respectively [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].
