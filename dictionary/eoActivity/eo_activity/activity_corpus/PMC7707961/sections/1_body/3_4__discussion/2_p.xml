<p>Twenty compounds were identified, accounting for 100% of the total EO, of which 1,6-dimethylspiro[4.5]decane 
 <bold>1</bold>, caryophyllene oxide 
 <bold>2</bold>, and 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene 
 <bold>3</bold> were the most abundant components representing 27.51%, 20.08%, and 18.28%, respectively. The twenty components could be classified into eight phytochemical groups, of which sesquiterpene hydrocarbon was the most abundant group (38.49%), followed by the oxygenated sesquiterpene (caryophyllene oxide) group (20.08%) and spiroalkane group (29.14%). The major components of sesquiterpene hydrocarbon were 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene (18.28%), 
 <italic>β</italic>-farnesene (6.2%), and 
 <italic>γ</italic>-caryophyllene (4.95%). The comical compositions of EO of 
 <italic>G. curviflora</italic> growing in Lebanese and Jordanian mountains were reported. Musso et al. reported the identification of 49 compounds in the EO extracted from 
 <italic>G. curviflora</italic> growing in Lebanon, of which 2-isopropyl-5-methyl-3-cyclohexen-1-one (12.51%), (-)-spathulenol (11.73%),

 <italic>Z</italic>-
 <italic>α</italic>-bisabolene epoxide (8.07%), widdrol (7.0%), (
 <italic>E</italic>, 
 <italic>Z</italic>)-5, 7-dodecadiene (6.93%), dihydronepetalactone (5.57%), and 4-propyl-cyclohexene (5.43%) were the major constituents [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A study conducted by Al-Qudah on EO from fresh and dry aerial parts of 
 <italic>G. curviflora</italic> from Jordan revealed that fresh one was composed mostly of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (55.27%) whilst air-dried 
 <italic>G. curviflora</italic> was composed mainly of oxygenated monoterpenes (50.31%). The main detected compounds from the fresh sample were
