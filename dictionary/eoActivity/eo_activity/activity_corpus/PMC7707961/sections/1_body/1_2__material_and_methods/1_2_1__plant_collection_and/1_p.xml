<p>The flowers and leaves of the 
 <italic>G. curviflora</italic> plant were compiled from the Birzeit mountains in Palestine in May 2019. The taxonomical characterization was executed by Dr. Nidal Jaradat a pharmacognosist. The dried herbarium was kept at the Herbal Products Laboratory labeled as Pharm-PCT-1633 obtained from the voucher specimen code. After washing with distilled water, the leaves and flowers were left to dry in the shadow at a 25 ± 2°C temperature and 55 ± 5 RH humidity for two weeks then powdered using a mechanical grinder and stored in paper bags [

 <italic>G. curviflora</italic> EO was extracted utilizing the Ultrasonic-Microwave apparatus according to the literature procedure [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A 1 L round-bottom flask containing 50 g of the dried plant powder and 0.5 L of distilled water was positioned in the apparatus and connected to the Clevenger apparatus. The microwave power was adjusted at 800 W and the extraction was executed at 90°C for 20 min, where the same process was triplicated. The attained EO was dried using calcium chloride and stored at 2–8°C. The dried plant sample provided 0.905 g of a colorless oil in 1.81% yield average of the isolated EO.
