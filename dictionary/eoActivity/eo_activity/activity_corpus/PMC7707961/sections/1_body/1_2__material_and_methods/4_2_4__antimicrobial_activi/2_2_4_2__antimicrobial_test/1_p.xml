<p>The well-diffusion assay was used for screening of the antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>G. curviflora</italic> EO. The bacterial suspension was formulated by the addition of selected colonies from agar culture to a test tube containing 5 mL of nutrient broth. Then, the turbidity of the sample was compared to that of McFarland nephelometer tube no. 0.5 (1.5 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/ml). A 1 mL of the suspension was added to 2 mL of nutrient broth (0.5 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/ml). 
 <italic>G. curviflora</italic> EO underwent a sequential broth dilution technique to evaluate their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for all tested microbial strains.
