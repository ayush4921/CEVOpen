<p>The data obtained from the cyclooxygenase inhibitory assay were displayed as means ± SD. 
 <italic>t</italic>-test was performed to identify and quantify the chemical components while one-way ANOVA was utilized for electrophysiology recordings. The significant differences were considered at 
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05 for the cyclooxygenase inhibitory assay, while that for the electrophysiology section was considered at three levels: 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001. At 50% (IC
 <sub>50</sub>), the inhibitory concentration was calculated from BioDataFit HTP 1.2 (USA). Data obtained from whole-cell current recordings were expressed as means ± SD of 
 <italic>n</italic> = 5 for the number of trials, performed at −60 mV, pH 7.4 at 22°C, and analyzed using Wave Metrics, Inc. Igor Pro7.
