<p>Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 0.8 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells /mL; treated cells were harvested and washed twice with cold PBS, and then, total cellular RNA was extracted by using the Tripure Isolation Reagent following the manufacturer’s instructions (Life Science Cat. No. 11 667 165 001). To purify RNA from residual solvent and to remove any potential DNA contamination, RNA was subjected to a cleaning and DNAse treatment step using a kit from Zymo Research_(R1080). RNA concentrations were measured using a Nano DropTM 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific), and the integrity/quality of the RNA was evaluated by capillary electrophoresis. To identify deregulated genes associated with apoptosis, autophagy, necroptosis, and oxidative stress, we used quantitative RT-PCR arrays (Human Cell Death Pathway 96 StellARray™ qPCR Array) from Qiagen. The list of genes is available online at

Cell Stress Gene Array and Custom RT2 Profiler PCR Arrays (CAPH1376) were also purchased from Qiagen (Venlo, The Netherlands). Briefly, RNA was reverted to cDNA using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (QuantaBio, 95048), and 500 ng of cDNA was mixed with SYBR Green reagent (Thermo Fisher, 4368708). A total of 20 µL of the obtained mixture was applied to a 96-microarray plate, and quantification was performed in the StepOnePlus™ Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). A list of down- and upregulated genes was obtained by a comparative analysis of CT values from untreated and treated conditions using 2
 <sup>−ddCt</sup>.
