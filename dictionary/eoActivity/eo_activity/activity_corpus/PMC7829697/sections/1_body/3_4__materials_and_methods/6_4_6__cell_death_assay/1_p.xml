<p>Cells were seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 0.8 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/mL. After incubation with different drugs, cells were harvested and washed twice with PBS-EDTA. Cell death was determined using an Annexin-V-FITC/PI (propidium iodide)-based apoptosis detection kit from BD Pharmingen kit (556547) following the manufacturer’s instructions. After staining, the cell death of PBMCs was evaluated by flow cytometry (Navios-Beckman Coulter), and the data generated were analyzed by Kaluza software 2.1 (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). We have considered the value of the DMSO (vehicle) effect as 100% viable cells for each cells type. We calculated the drug effect with subtraction of the vehicle effect for each cells type.
