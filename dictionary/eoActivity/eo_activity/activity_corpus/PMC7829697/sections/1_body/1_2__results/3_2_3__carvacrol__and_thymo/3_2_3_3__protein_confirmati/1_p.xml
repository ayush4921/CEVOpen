<p>To confirm the results obtained in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f007">Figure 7</xref>D, the expression of these genes was analyzed by Western blot. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f008">Figure 8</xref>, the carvacrol and thymol combination shows a potential synergistic effect by inducing the decrease of procaspase-3 and procaspase-9 expression and the increase of CHOP expression. CHOP is involved in reticular stress, and it is known that ROS can trigger endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress or vice versa in vivo and in vitro [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. We also analyzed the protein expression of PI3K and p-AKT to determine how the carvacrol and thymol combination may modulate the antiapoptotic mechanisms of cell death resistance. As previously stated, we observed an upregulation of insulin growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) gene expression in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f007">Figure 7</xref>C. This is important, as a sustained activation of AKT/mTOR in malignant-resistant cells is regulated by the upregulation of the IGF1R [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f008">Figure 8</xref>, the potential synergistic effect of carvacrol and thymol in the induction of leukemic cell death is also associated with the decrease of PI3K and p-AKT protein expression in combination-treated cells compared to vehicle and cells treated with carvacrol or thymol separately. These Western blot results confirm that the combination of carvacrol and thymol induces cell death through apoptotic, oxidative, and cell stress pathways. Gene and protein expression profiling indicates that the potential synergistic effect of this combination is associated with both cell death and antiproliferative signaling pathways.
