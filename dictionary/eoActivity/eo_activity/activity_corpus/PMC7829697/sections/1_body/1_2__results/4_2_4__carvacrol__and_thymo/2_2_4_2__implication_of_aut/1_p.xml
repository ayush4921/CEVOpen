<p>Cell death is often regulated by multiple molecular pathways and mechanisms, including apoptosis, autophagy, and necrosis. The molecular network underlying these processes is often intertwined, and one pathway can dynamically shift to another due to the role of certain genes, such as TP53, TNF, and ATF4, in different cell death pathways. Therefore, we analyzed the expression of genes involved in autophagy and necrosis in the three cell lines treated with the combination of carvacrol and thymol. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f010">Figure 10</xref>, car–thy-induced cell death is associated with the overexpression of genes implicated in autophagy (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f010">Figure 10</xref>A), including ULK1, SQSTM1, ATG12, GAA, INS, MAP1LC3A, and TP53, and necrosis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f010">Figure 10</xref>B), such as HSPBAP1, FOXI1, DENND4A, C1orf159, PARP1, PARP2, PVR, ATP6V1G2, BMF, DPYSL4, and GALNT5. A few of these genes are significantly upregulated in the three cell lines, while others are upregulated but statistically significant in only two cell lines. Together, these results showed that car–thy-induced cell death in leukemic cells, except in HL60 cells, is associated with non-apoptotic and caspase-independent pathways in leukemic cell lines. The induced cell death in the HL60 cell line is caspase-dependent, ROS production-independent, and associated with non-apoptotic pathways. In conclusion, the combination of thymol and carvacrol has a potential synergistic effect on myeloid leukemia cell death induction by apoptotic and non-apoptotic pathways.
