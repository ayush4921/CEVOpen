    "Peony (<i>Paeonia</i>) has high ornamental, edible, and medicinal values. In order to distinguish seeds varieties, describe the proteomic profiles correlated with stress tolerance, and evaluate peony seed protein (PSP) as a functional food product, we characterized the seed protein profiles of these three species and their glucosidase inhibition activities. Results showed that the intensity of protein bands in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and specific protein ID (especially for specifically expressed proteins (SEPs)) was effective to distinguish these peony seed varieties. Proteomic analysis of the three species showed that <i>P. ostii</i> \"Fengdan\" has heat and pathogen tolerance-related proteins, while <i>P. rockii</i> has higher content of proteins related to cold resistance, which were all highly consistent with their adaptation of heat or cold habitat. Moreover, stress-related proteins were also accumulated in <i>P. lactiflora</i> Pall \"Hangshao\" seeds, showing its potential for stress resistance. Further protein analysis showed that the primary composition of PSP was albumin and globulin. And the solubility of PSP was good. Furthermore, PSP also showed high glucosidase inhibition activity, indicating that PSP might have some potential function for the remission of hyperglycemia. And <i>P. ostii</i> \"Fengdan\" seeds may be a better source for protein production than seeds of the other two species in terms of protein solubility and the content of total protein, albumin, and globulin. In addition, an optimal protocol of microwave-assisted alkali extraction was developed to produce PSP. In conclusion, the evaluated stress-related proteins in three peony seed species by proteomic analysis quite agreed with their adaptation of heat or cold stress; proteomics could also be a very useful tool for distinguishing species in the production; and peony seeds may be a good source for protein production."
