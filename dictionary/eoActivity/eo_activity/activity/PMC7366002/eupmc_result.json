    "<h4>Background</h4>The present work aimed to evaluate the chemical composition of Curcuma zadoaria essential oil and to investigate its efficacy and safety against hydatid cyst protoscoleces.<h4>Methods</h4>Collected protoscoleces from liver fertile hydatid cysts of infected sheep were exposed to different concentrations of the essential oil (75, 150, 300 μl/mL) for 5-30 min in vitro and ex vivo. Then, by using the eosin exclusion assay, the viability of protoscoleces was studied. In the next step, 24 male NMRI mice were examined to assess the toxicity of C. zadoaria essential oil by measuring the biochemical and hematological parameters.<h4>Results</h4>Based on the obtained results, the LD50 value of intraperitoneal injection of the C. zadoaria essential oil was 1.76 mL/kg of body weight and the maximum non-fatal dose was 0.96 mL/kg of body weight. C. zadoaria essential oil had a strong proto scolicidal activity in vitro so that at the 300 and 150 μl/ml entirely eliminates the parasite after 5 and 10 minutes; whereas, weak proto scolicidal activity was observed at lower doses. Ex vivo assay, no similar effect with in vitro was observed, therefore, more time is required to show a potent proto scolicidal activity. C. zadoaria essential oil at the concentrations of 300 and 150 μl/mL after an exposure time of 7 and 12 min, killed 100% of protoscoleces within the hydatid cyst, respectively. After intraperitoneal injection of the C. zadoaria essential oil for 2 weeks, no significant difference (p > 0.05) was observed in the clinical chemistry and hematologic parameters at the doses of 0.15, 0.3, 0.6 mL/kg.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The obtained results in vitro and ex vivo exhibited that C. zadoaria essential oil had a favorable proto scolicidal activity on hydatid cyst protoscoleces. However, more supplementary works are required to verify these findings by assessing clinical subjects."
