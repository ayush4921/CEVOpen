    "The COVID-19 virus vaccination is under process for adaptive immunity. Besides, the virus transmission rate is rapid, being symptomatic and asymptomatic. The curative rate and fatality rate depends on the age groups and individualâ€™s previous health history. To overcome this pandemic spread, development of immune system for every individual is more essential. The antimicrobial enzyme lysozyme is a key component in the immune system which can fight against any infections. It is present naturally and can be generated in the human body from saliva, human milk, tears, and mucus. In general foods have more nutrient values and improve immunity. The outcome of this paper is to understand the importance of immunity and how to build up immune system to fight against any viral infections especially COVID-19. Indian conventional foods containing the main constituents, such as lysozyme, antioxidants, vitamins, minerals, and herbs for boosting the immunity were focused in this study."
