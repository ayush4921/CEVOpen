    "Graphical abstract Medicinal chemistry can rightfully be regarded as a cornerstone in the public health of our modern society that combines chemistry and pharmacology with the aim of designing and developing new pharmaceutical compounds. For this purpose, many chemical techniques as well as new computational chemistry applications are used to study the utilization of drugs and their biological effects. In the biological interface, medicinal chemistry constitutes a group of interdisciplinary sciences, as well as controlling its organic, physical and computational pillars. Therefore, medicinal chemists working to design an integrated and developing system that portends an era of novel and safe tailored drugs either by synthesizing new pharmaceuticals or to improving the processes by which existing pharmaceuticals are made. It includes researching the effects of synthetic, semi-synthetic and natural biologically active substances based on molecular interactions in terms of molecular structure with triggered functional groups or the specific physicochemical properties. The present work focuses on the literature survey of chemical diversity of phenoxy acetamide and its derivatives (Chalcone, Indole and Quinoline) in the molecular framework in order to get complete information regarding pharmacologically interesting compounds of widely different composition. From a biological and industrial point of view, this literature review may provide an opportunity for the chemists to design new derivatives of phenoxy acetamide and its derivatives that proved to be the successful agent in view of safety and efficacy to enhance life quality."
