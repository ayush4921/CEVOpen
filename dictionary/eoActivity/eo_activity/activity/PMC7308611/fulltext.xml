The fraction produced dose-dependent and significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 and <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) activities in castor oil-induced diarrheal models. Moreover, CTFAA significantly (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) demonstrated a 15.29% clot lysis effect in the thrombolytic test, and the brine shrimp lethality assay LC<sub>50</sub> value was 424.16 &#x003bc;g/ml bioassay. In conclusion, the current study showed CTFAA has significant antidiarrheal effects along with modest antioxidant and thrombolytic effects, and these data warrant further experiment to justify and include CTFAA as a supplement to mitigate the onset of diarrheal and cardiovascular disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Actinodaphne angustifolia Nees</kwd><kwd>Antidiarrheal activity</kwd><kwd>Antioxidant activity</kwd><kwd>Cytotoxic activity</kwd><kwd>Thrombolytic activity</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bangladesh is very rich in medicinal plants, and more than a thousand plants have been documented with prominent pharmacological efficiency [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Although advanced allopathic medicines are available, a vast majority (75&#x02013;80%) of the population of this country still preferring traditional medicine as the first line of therapy for most of the diseases, because of affordability, availability, and safety [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It has been reported that natural remedies have a broad range of beneficial activities in the experimental studies [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;10</xref>]. Over the centuries, plant-based ailment has been used by different communities worldwide [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The local people of Bangladesh utilize medicinal plants as a primary source of their healthcare system to cure a large number of diseases [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The efficiency of plant-derived drugs mostly depends on their antioxidative property. In most disease cases, excessive reactive oxygen species generation plays as a major culprit; therefore, either neutralizing or controlling reactive oxygen species production is the best possibility to delay or cure several disease conditions. This hypothesis directs novel therapeutics researchers to target natural sources repeatedly.</p><p>Diarrhea is the frequent bowel movements with wet stool and abdominal cramps [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. It is one of the most killer diseases in the world and contributing substantial pediatric morbidity and mortality [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], especially a threat for malnourished children in developing countries. Despite repeated effort has been given to eradicate this threat, yet the prevalence and incidence of diarrhea are high (approximately 7.1 million per year) [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Current therapy of diarrhea includes antibiotics, which sometimes aggravate adverse effects and no-antibiotic treatment also causes some common adverse effects like constipation [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Therefore, a safe and effective agent is being searched from plant origin that has always been an essential source of new drugs. The World Health Organization (WHO) is also encouraging the study and finding the treatment and prevention of diarrheal diseases using traditional medicines [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Thrombosis is a lethal disease, which relates to acute coronary disorders such as pulmonary emboli, deep vein thrombosis, strokes, heart failure, and venous thromboembolic disorders that account for sudden morbidity and mortality [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Thrombosis is also associated with the vascular blockade and while it is recovering, can cause a fatal consequence like cerebral or myocardial infarction and even leads to death [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. They are currently using thrombolytic agents including tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), alteplase, anistreplase, urokinase, and streptokinase (SK) and recombinant tPA, although, highly effective treatment for thrombolysis. But these therapeutics are associated with severe adverse effects such as anaphylactic reaction, systemic fibrinolysis, hemorrhage, slow reperfusion rate, and frequent early occlusions [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. An alternative option from traditional and herbal drugs is frequently being searched for their safety profile, thus, to overcome current adverse effects of this therapy based on the high importance of the thrombolytic agents. Several plants have already been documented as emerging and potential thrombolytic agents [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], which has encouraged to extend the search of potential thrombolytic agents from the plant source.</p><p><italic>Actinodaphne</italic> is an Asian genus belongs to the family Lauraceae, bay laurel-related, which is a flowering plants class within the order Laurales [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This genus is important both pharmaceutically and medicinally. For instance, <italic>A. hookeri</italic> seed oil is used in rheumatic arthritis, and the bark is used in fracture, <italic>A. lancifolia</italic> has potential effect in the treatment of edema, arthritis, and overexertion [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23&#x02013;26</xref>]. <italic>Actinodaphne angustifolia</italic> Nees is a medium-sized evergreen tree and widely distributed in the forests of Chittagong, Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT), Cox&#x02019;s Bazar, Sylhet, and North Bengal regions of Bangladesh. Although a little information of pharmacological activity has documented, traditionally <italic>A. angustifolia</italic> has been used for treatments. Locally, the leaves are used in the treatment of urinary disorder and diabetes in Khagrachari district of CHT. A phytochemical investigation of the leaves has shown the presence of &#x003b2;-sitosterol, quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside, vitexin, friedelin, and hydrocarbons [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Presence of these phytochemicals suggests that <italic>A. angustifolia</italic> leaves might have potential antioxidant property and so the present study postulate that the carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) fraction of leaves of <italic>A. angustifolia</italic> (CTFAA) may have possible activity against thrombosis, diarrhea and oxidative stress.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Plant and chemicals</title><p>Fresh leaves of <italic>A. angustifolia</italic> were collected from forest region of Rangamati, Bangladesh.

Brine shrimp (<italic>Artemia salina</italic>) eggs were hatched in a conically shaped vessel (capacity = 1 l) containing artificial seawater (sea salt 38 g/l; adjusted pH 8.5). A divider was used to make two unequal compartments in the vessel. The eggs were sprinkled into the larger chamber, which was darkened, while the smaller compartment was illuminated. The vessel was placed at room temperature (25&#x000b0;C) under constant aeration. After 48 h, live nauplii free from eggshells were collected from the brighter portion of the hatching chamber. The fraction (25 mg) was dissolved in 5 ml of 1% aqueous DMSO solution to obtain a concentration of 5 mg/ml, which was subjected to serial dilution, getting different concentrations of 1000, 800, 500, 300, 200, and 100 &#x000b5;g/ml.

Several methods can be used to investigate the antioxidant effect of plant extracts [<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and here we used a common <italic>in vitro</italic> test to assess the antioxidant potentiality of CTFAA. The antioxidant effect of CTFAA was evaluated based on DPPH free radical scavenging activity and reducing power capacity assay. As a stable free radical, DPPH has been widely accepted as a tool for estimating free radical scavenging activities of an antioxidant. To become a stable diamagnetic molecule, it can accept an electron or hydrogen radical [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In this present study, CTFAA showed substantial concentration-dependent free radical scavenging activity. Thus, the phytochemical constituents of CTFAA might be releasing hydrogen and that neutralizing free radicals to scavenge the potential oxidative stress.</p><p>The reducing power capacity shown by the fraction is also reflecting the antioxidant efficiency of CTFAA. This activity was assessed by using Fe<sup>3+</sup> to Fe<sup>2+</sup> reduction assay, where the yellow color of the test solution changes to different shades of green and blue based on the reducing capacity of sample [<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. We have found that the reducing power activity of CTFAA was increased in a concentration-dependent manner. It has been reported that phenolic compounds play an essential role in the reducing power capacity of extracts and fractions [<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. CTFAA may be consist of a wide range of phenolic, flavonoid, and flavanol contents. It should also be considered that lots phenolic and flavonoid derivatives are extracted in less polar solvent like CCl<sub>4</sub>, which need to be assessed by comparing chemical characterization of different fractions. Overall, current analysis has correlated an establishment between the DPPH and total phenolic content. These results are complying with the previous investigations [<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], where it has been interpreted that the extract with higher phenolic content exhibits potential scavenging of DPPH free radical. Antioxidant activity of most medicinal plants is because of their redox properties due to the presence of different polyphenolic derivatives, which donates hydrogen, and acts as reducing agent and oxygen scavenger [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, Brine shrimp lethality bioassay is a typical assay to assess the toxicity of plant extract or compounds [<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The cytotoxicity assay showed that CTFAA has less lethality with LC<sub>50</sub> of 424.16 &#x003bc;g/ml, which indicates that this extract is safe to use in the animal model.</p><p>Thrombolytic drugs block the formation of thrombus by binding with plasmin and lyses fibrinogen and fibrin coagulation. The different report confirms that flavonoid derivatives of plant interferes in platelet aggregation and reduces the risk of thrombosis and cardiovascular disease [<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The current study has evaluated the thrombolytic activity of CTFAA, where SK used as a positive control and sterile distilled water used as a negative control. We find that CTFAA significantly increased the lyses clot as compared with negative controls. This preliminary investigation result is directing towards advanced study with CTFAA in particular cardiovascular disease model [<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] as blood clot is the most critical event in which the damaged expanses of the endothelial cell surface or blood vessel are clogged by the deposition of fibrin, platelets and tissue factor [<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The presence of phytochemicals, including saponin, tannin, and alkaloids in the fractions are the probable responsible for demonstrating the thrombolytic activity [<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p><p>We also employed castor oil-induced diarrheal models in mice to investigate the antidiarrheal efficacy of CTFAA. Our study demonstrated that CTFAA has a dose-dependent substantiality to reduce the frequency of defecation. Castor oil is a known agent that causes increased permeability of water and electrolyte into intestinal mucosa that results in a watery luminal content flow throughout the small and large intestine [<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In castor oil-induced diarrhea, CTFAA showed a significantly decreased the frequency of purging (reduction of the number of wet feces) and decreased in the weight of wet feces with increasing the percent of inhibition of defecation. Determination of the percentage of inhibition has been based on the reduction of the frequency of wet feces and is a good marker of antidiarrheal activity. Besides, our results directly demonstrated an inhibition of castor oil-induced intestinal fluid accumulation (enteropooling) with a significant reduction of the weight and volume of intestinal contents. The mechanism might be involving the gastrointestinal motility, as well as water and electrolyte transport (decreasing Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> absorption) across the intestinal mucosa [<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Thus, the CTFAA possibly reduced diarrhea by increasing reabsorption of the electrolytes and water or by inhibiting induced intestinal accumulation of fluid just as the standard drug like loperamide. CTFAA also significantly suppressed the propulsion of charcoal marker at all tested doses in castor oil-induced intestinal transit or motility. This finding suggests that CTFAA can influence the peristaltic movement of the intestine, thereby indicating the importance to be included as a supplement to reduce motility in the diarrheal patient.</p><p>Phytochemicals such as flavonoids and polyphenols are accountable for the antidiarrheal activity [<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Flavonoids can prevent intestinal motility, and water and electrolytes secretion [<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Moreover, flavonoids can inhibit prostaglandin E2 induced intestinal secretion- and spasmogens-induced contraction and also inhibit the release of prostaglandins and autacoids [<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Thereby, flavonoids as the inhibitors of prostaglandins biosynthesis are considered to delay castor oil-induced diarrhea [<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Polyphenols also can show antidiarrheal property by interacting and preventing cytochrome P450 systems [<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. According to our data, CTFAA contains flavonoid and phenolic compounds that might be responsible for the substantial antidiarrheal activity.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>As per the data discussed, CTFAA displayed modest antioxidant effect.
