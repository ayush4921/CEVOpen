    "In this study, the effect of grape seed protein hydrolysate (GPH) on the physicochemical and sensory properties of stirred yogurt was evaluated. At first, the antioxidant properties and degree of hydrolysis (DH) of GPH were determined using the microbial protease enzymes (alcalase and flavourzyme), the results showed that alcalase enzyme can produce GPH with higher DH and antioxidant properties (<i>p</i> < .05). Also, increasing the hydrolysis time had a positive effect on these properties (<i>p</i> < .05). The DH, free radical scavenging DPPH, and ferric reducing power for GPH by alcalase at 30 min was 21.51%, 88.68%, and 0.33 μmol ferrous/ g, respectively. Therefore, this treatment was used for further experiments. In the next part, the mentioned GPH was added to the stirred yogurt with three concentrations (0.5, 1.5, and 1.5%) and physicochemical properties and viability of <i>Lactobacillus casei</i> and sensory properties were measured during 15 days of storage. The results showed that the GPH treatment had higher pH, viscosity, and texture firmness and less acidity and syneresis compared with the control sample (<i>p</i> < .05). Also, in these samples, the decreasing trend of <i>L. casei</i> viability was slower than the control treatment during the storage period (<i>p</i> < .05). In most parameters, better results were observed with increasing the concentration GPH and all the treatments were acceptable in terms of sensory properties. Therefore, by producing yogurt containing GPH, a new functional food can be provided for consumers of dairy products, which in addition to the desired taste, good nutritional properties can be also achieved from its consumption."
