Introduction</title><p>Cancer is a disease caused by the transformation of cells that become abnormal and proliferate excessively. These disordered cells sometimes end up forming a mass called a malignant tumor which promotes tumor formation and metastasis.</p><p>Cancer is a major public health problem worldwide and it is the second leading cause of death in the United States. In 2018, about 1,735,350 new cancer cases and 609,640 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States [<xref rid="B1-medicines-07-00040" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>The most common causes of cancer death are cancers of the lung, breast, and colorectal in females whereas cancers of lung, colorectal, and prostate in males. These cancers account for about half of all cancer deaths, with more than one-quarter due to lung cancer [<xref rid="B2-medicines-07-00040" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>For a few decades, lung cancer has been and remains the foremost common danger within the world with an assessed 1.6 million new cases per year (12.7%). It is additionally the driving cause of cancer-related mortality with an evaluated 1.37 million deaths per year [<xref rid="B3-medicines-07-00040" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Routine treatments such as chemopreventive agents are characterized as compounds anticipating the event of harm by restraining the enactment of a carcinogen, repressing its interaction with cellular macromolecules, or by deactivation and clearance of the carcinogen, or to control or switch the damage caused by a carcinogen. These chemopreventive agents which will decrease the frequency and mortality of cancer may be displayed in plants, vegetables, and natural products [<xref rid="B4-medicines-07-00040" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>There are several treatments for lung and breast cancer, including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. According to the circumstances, each of these treatments may be undertaken with either a &#x02018;radical&#x02019; or &#x02018;palliative&#x02019; intent [<xref rid="B5-medicines-07-00040" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-medicines-07-00040" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>About 70% of lung cancer patients have locally progressed or metastatic disease at diagnosis, and chemotherapy may be there as it was the treatment of choice. Chemotherapy may help decrease or slow the growth of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. It can also help in controlling the symptoms of some patients [<xref rid="B6-medicines-07-00040" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Thus, the importance of chemotherapy in the treatment of NSCLC based on the use of chemotherapy after surgery: For an early stage of NSCLC (non-small-cell lung carcinoma), chemotherapy after surgery may help reduce the risk of recurrence of cancer. Chemotherapy is usually started within eight weeks after surgery. Chemotherapeutic combinations tend to work better than simple medications. Physicians usually combine CDDP or carboplatin with at least one other medicine such as paclitaxel (Taxol) and docetaxel (Taxotere) [<xref rid="B6-medicines-07-00040" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Chemotherapy with radiotherapy: Chemotherapy is sometimes given before or after radiotherapy. It can help get rid of NSCLC at an early stage in people who cannot have surgery. These treatments can also prolong the survival of some people with a small NSCLC, even if they are not likely to be cured of their cancer [<xref rid="B7-medicines-07-00040" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>However, the efficacy of chemotherapy in patients with advanced lung cancer is extremely limited, due to drug resistance and toxic side effects of drugs, which results from the genetic and epigenetic regulation of various critical genes [<xref rid="B8-medicines-07-00040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Breast cancer remains the foremost common threatening tumor in ladies, in spite of advancements in determination and treatment. Even when treated early, about 50% of patients with breast cancer still encounter backslide and metastasis. For these patients, an efficient and comprehensive treatment is required, counting systemic chemotherapy, endocrine treatment, focused on targeted treatment. Systemic chemotherapy is one of the foremost viable treatment choices for repetitive metastatic breast cancer (rMBC), in spite of the fact that there is no gold standard regimen. Numerous chemotherapy regimens that incorporate anthracycline combined with Taxus are confined by total cardiac poisonous quality and sedate resistance. Docetaxel has been prescribed as a first-line medication for rMBC [<xref rid="B9-medicines-07-00040" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Treatment of lung, breast, and colon cancer cells with PTC-209 (potential compound a small-molecule Bmi-1 inhibitor) (1 and 2.5 &#x003bc;M) for 48 h showed no caspase-3 activation, but a decrease in the cell number below the seeding level suggests that PTC-209 reduces cellular viability probably through inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of cell death via a caspase-3-independent mechanism. The molecular mechanism analysis revealed that PTC-209 significantly inhibited the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation by decreasing the expression level of gp130 (glycoprotein 130) as early as 30 min post-treatment [<xref rid="B10-medicines-07-00040" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>The adequacy and security of the docetaxel and lobaplatin (DL) and docetaxel and gemcitabine (DG) regimens for treatment of repetitive and metastatic cancer were watched for the primary time. Based on the results, both of these combined chemotherapy regimens are viable, treatment-related side impacts are passable, and either can be utilized for viable treatment for progressed cancer [<xref rid="B11-medicines-07-00040" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>However, these treatments induce undesirable effects and are thus little tolerated by most patients. Scientific research aims to find effective treatments with a better safety profile.</p><p>Medicinal plants have diverse and beneficial activities for several types of diseases such as cancer, bacterial infections, diabetes, and inflammatory diseases. Medicinal plants are the source of a wide variety of natural products such as phenolic acids and flavonoids which are very interesting for their antioxidant properties and antitumor effects. Therefore, naturally-derived compounds are considered to have less side effects compared to current medications such as chemotherapy [<xref rid="B12-medicines-07-00040" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Numerous plant species are as of now being utilized to treat or anticipate the advancement of cancer. Several analysts have recognized species of plants that have illustrated anticancer properties [<xref rid="B13-medicines-07-00040" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Eucalyptus is one of those medicinal plants widely distributed in Australia. Eucalyptus species are commonly encountered in the Mediterranean region. These species are traditionally used in medicine as analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic remedies for the symptoms of respiratory infections, such as cold, flu, sinus congestion for diarrhea, and as an astringent in dentistry [<xref rid="B14-medicines-07-00040" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Moreover, the Eucalyptol of Eucalyptus species has been used in the pharmaceutical, cosmetics, food, and medicinal purposes [<xref rid="B15-medicines-07-00040" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Eucalyptus species have been utilized for the treatment of illness. In expansion, the gum that is gotten from the tree by making cuts within the trunk of <italic>E. citriodora</italic> is utilized for the treatment of diarrhea and bladder inflammation, and is connected to cuts and scraped spots and has chemopreventive impacts [<xref rid="B16-medicines-07-00040" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>The Eucalyptus is a widely grown tree, well known for the production of essential oils, with high biological activities used in various fields. Its leaves also provide extracts used in cosmetic formulations [<xref rid="B17-medicines-07-00040" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The essential oils have been used for pharmaceutical and medicinal purposes, and several studies have reported that these oils displayed multiple pharmacological activities, including antibacterial, anti-inflammatory activities, antitermitic activity, larvicidal and mosquito repellent activities, as well as antioxidative and antiradical activities [<xref rid="B18-medicines-07-00040" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>In Australia, Eucalyptus leaves were traditionally used to heal wounds and fungal infections. They are also used in the treatment of respiratory diseases, such as the common cold, influenza, and sinus congestion. In Africa, the powder of barks has been indicated as insecticide. In addition to their uses in folk medicine, many studies demonstrated analgesic, expectorant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties from the leaves of Eucalyptus [<xref rid="B19-medicines-07-00040" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Eucalyptus species are also important in the forest area of Tunisia where the most abundant species are <italic>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</italic> and <italic>E. cineria</italic> [<xref rid="B17-medicines-07-00040" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>In addition, the antiproliferative effect of <italic>E. citriodora</italic> resin (ECR) on human hepatoma HepG2 cells was evaluated; so that the results from the MTT assay showed that water extracts of ECR (WEECR) in the dose range of 0&#x02013;500 &#x000b5;g/mL displayed stronger cytotoxic effects on HepG2 cells than other organic solvent extracts of ECR. Moreover, the WEECR treatment has an apoptotic response in HepG2 cells, with an increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and activation of caspase-3 [<xref rid="B19-medicines-07-00040" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Cisplatin (CDDP) is a well-known chemotherapeutic drug which has been used for the treatment of numerous human cancers including bladder, head and neck, lung, ovarian, and testicular cancers [<xref rid="B20-medicines-07-00040" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>The combination of a Chinese herbal medicine and CDDP may represent a novel approach in the treatment of NSCLC and thus offer a new target for chemotherapy [<xref rid="B4-medicines-07-00040" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic> flower essential oil decreases melanin synthesis, inactivates protein kinase A (PKA) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, and inhibits tyrosinase activity which has an antioxidant activity, as well as decreases melanogenesis in melanoma cells by [<xref rid="B18-medicines-07-00040" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>The essential oils of <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic> may be potentially suitable for controlling mosquitoes at the larval stage. The volatile fractions isolated from <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic> leaves collected in Kurdistan contained critical and broadly used flavor and scent fixing. Most constituents, basically 1,8-cineole and other oxygenated monoterpenoids, are naturally dynamic, showing well-known antibacterial, bronchodilatory, anti-inflammatory, and pain-relieving impacts. They illustrated that the inward breath of vapors from a hot watery implantation of <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic> taking off in diseases, is maintained by logical prove [<xref rid="B21-medicines-07-00040" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>The antimicrobial potential of the basic oils extracted from seven Eucalyptus species was higher against the Gram-positive microscopic organism than the Gram-negative ones and two sorts of parasites. These fundamental oils were exceptionally successful and may be used in solutions, makeup, nourishment, and flavors businesses. The combination of a Chinese herbal medicine and CDDP may represent a novel approach in the treatment for NSCLC and thus offer a new target for chemotherapy [<xref rid="B4-medicines-07-00040" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>In this study, our aim is to produce a chemotherapeutic agent that will induce a synergetic effect by decreasing the dose of CDDP and combine it by natural constituents of Eucalyptus. Therefore, we investigated the effect of a combination of low doses of CDDP (cis-dichloro-diamine-platinum) with two different extracts (ethanolic and aqueous) of Lebanese Eucalyptus species on A549 and MCF-7 (Michigan Cancer Foundation-7) cell lines, and on normal cells (PBMC).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-medicines-07-00040"><title>2.

Treatment with CDDP at the concentration of 4 &#x000b5;g/mL for 24 h caused a non-significant decrease in the % of cell viability compared to the control, but this concentration which is the least toxic one to PBMC is chosen for a later combination with the plant extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="medicines-07-00040-f006">Figure 6</xref>B). </p></sec><sec id="sec3dot8dot4-medicines-07-00040"><title>3.8.4.

Discussion</title><p>Globally, the increase in cancer incidence and mortality rates drives most researchers to do their best trying to find a treatment for this threat. Lung and breast cancers account for the highest cases and deaths, especially in undeveloped countries, such as Lebanon [<xref rid="B23-medicines-07-00040" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Many recent studies have been conducted on plants used in traditional medicine for treating various types of cancers, and antitumor compounds were found in them. </p><p>As an illustration, in vitro studies proved that the ethanolic extract of <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic> leaf exerts a cytotoxic effect on human chronic myelogenous leukemia cells (k562cells) [<xref rid="B24-medicines-07-00040" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Another study confirmed that the essential oil extracted from leaves of <italic>E. benthamii</italic> showed a cytotoxic effect against Jurkat (J774A.1) (T leukemia cells) and HeLa cells lines (cervical cancer cells) [<xref rid="B19-medicines-07-00040" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, cytotoxic activities of volatile oils and extracts from stems, leaves, and flowers of <italic>E. sideroxylon</italic> and <italic>E. torquata</italic> against the human breast adenocarcinoma cell line (MCF-7) were shown [<xref rid="B25-medicines-07-00040" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>In this study, qualitative and quantitative chemical analysis of active constituents of both extracts was performed. Then, the antioxidant activity of the ethanolic and aqueous extracts of <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic> was evaluated. Finally, the cytotoxic effect of the two different extracts alone or the aqueous extract combined with a low dose of chemotherapeutic drug (CDDP) on A549, MCF-7 cells, and PBMC cells was studied.</p><p>The phytochemical screening plays a good role in the estimation of possible involvement of this plant in the prevention or treatment of some diseases. In this project, qualitative analysis showed that there is a qualitative difference between the ethanolic and aqueous extracts in terms of resins, cardiac glycosides, and saponins. Important medicinal phytochemicals such as phenols, terpenoids, flavonoids, alkaloids, sterols and steroids, fixed oils, and fatty acids are present in <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic>. Terpenoids are anti-inflammatory, antiviral, inhibiting cholesterol synthesis, and antibacterial [<xref rid="B26-medicines-07-00040" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>It was also shown that the aqueous extract has more content of phenols and flavonoids than the ethanolic extract, which permits determining the mechanism of action of the combination of aqueous extract with CDDP. Bacaba is an inborn palm natural product from Amazon local wealthy in polyphenolics. The test appeared that these phenolic extracts actuated apoptosis in MCF-7 cancer cells through the mitochondrial pathway. Capaces-6, -8, and -9 were activated when compared to the untreated control in a measurement&#x02019;s subordinate way (p &#x0003c; 0.05). Inside these, caspace-9 appeared the most noteworthy activation. Since MCF-7 cells do not express caspace-3 and based on extra examinations on PARP-cleavage employing a caspace-9 inhibitor, the tests suggest that caspace-9 plays an imperative part within the apoptosis [<xref rid="B27-medicines-07-00040" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Moreover, it was proved that the aqueous extract has a higher DPPH radical scavenging activity than the ethanolic extract.</p><p>Concerning the neutral red assay, a significant decrease in the % of cell viability was observed at a low concentration of the aqueous extract (from 150 &#x000b5;g/mL) compared to the ethanolic one (from 300 &#x000b5;g/mL) during the treatment of A549 cells. For both extracts, the decrease in % of cell viability is dose dependent.</p><p>Moreover, the combination of aqueous extract with CDDP decreases the % of cell viability to a lower extent than the extract alone after 24 h of treatment at the level of A549 cells. The MTT results had confirmed those of neutral red, so that the combination of aqueous extract with CDDP decreases significantly the % viability of A549 cells.</p><p>For MCF-7 cells, a significant decrease in the % of cell viability was observed at a concentration of 300 &#x000b5;g/mL for both aqueous and ethanolic extracts. Moreover, combining the aqueous extract with CDDP decreases the % of cell viability to a lower extent than the extract alone after 24 h of treatment.</p><p>Given these points, it can be concluded that the aqueous extract has more cytotoxic effect than the ethanolic extract. Thus, it can be concluded that the secondary metabolite contents and antioxidant activities are closely related with the anti-tumor effect of plant extracts.</p><p>Regarding the cytotoxicity of <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic> extracts on normal cells (PBMC), it was shown that neither the ethanolic extract nor aqueous extract develop any toxicity towards PBMC. On the other hand, both extracts increase the % of cell viability of PBMC, with a greater extent for the aqueous extract. Moreover, the combination of CDDP with the aqueous extract showed a greater % of cell viability compared to CDDP alone. These results demonstrated that <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic> leaf extracts protect the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (monocytes and lymphocytes) from the cytotoxicity of CDDP and enhance their proliferation.</p><p>CDDP gets to be activated once it enters the cell. Within the cytoplasm the chloride particles on CDDP are uprooted by water molecules. This hydrolyzed item could be a strong electrophile that can respond with any nucleophile, counting the sulfhydryl bunches on proteins and nitrogen benefactor molecules on nucleic acids. CDDP ties to the N7 responsive center on purine buildups and as such can cause deoxyribonucleic corrosive (DNA) harm in cancer cells, blocking cell division and coming about in apoptotic cell death [<xref rid="B20-medicines-07-00040" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Patients treated with CDDP, alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs, endure from the side effects. Consequently, the thought is to decrease the concentration of CDDP and compensate it by the combination with the extract, in order to minimize the side effects. The results showed that the combinations with <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic> extracts had a synergistic anticancer effect that increased the anticancer effect of low-dose CDDP alone. These results encouraged the investigators to fabricate pharmaceutical drugs containing <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic> leaf extracts as an active ingredient.</p><p>The characteristic phenols were able to cause the arrest of the cancer cell cycle, proposing that particular cell cycle administrative proteins are conceivably included in their intracellular component of activity. Specifically, the characteristic compounds were uncovered to be more dynamic in CDDP-resistant cells than in wild sorts, particularly inducing apoptotic death [<xref rid="B28-medicines-07-00040" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Many therapies are now available for the treatment of lung and breast cancer including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy.</p><p>In order to minimize the side effects associated with these therapies, chemotherapy combinations with plant extracts have been used.</p><p>Medicinal plants are important for pharmacological research and drug development. They can complement the activity of the drugs used in traditional medicine and to which resistance develops in patients.</p><p>Indeed, our study has shown that the Eucalyptus contains active compounds such as polyphenols, alkaloids, tannins, flavonoids, sterols, steroids, fatty acids, and glycosides. Of which the alkaloid and phenols have had significant anti-cancer and antioxidants activities, then we can suggest that <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic> that contains phenol can induce apoptosis of cancer cells. In the same way, the flavonoids have effects as antimutagens and anti-tumors. They also have a protective effect against cancer by their effect on signal transduction in cell proliferation and angiogenesis [<xref rid="B29-medicines-07-00040" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>The DPPH method was used to monitor the antioxidant activity of the extracts of plants.
