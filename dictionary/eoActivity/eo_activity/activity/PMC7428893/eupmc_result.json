    "<h4>Introduction</h4>Sexual function greatly affects the quality of life. Any problem which affects satisfaction is considered sexual dysfunction.<h4>Aim</h4>The aim of this study was to investigate how recently used of complementary and alternative medicines has increased in treating infertility.<h4>Methods</h4>Study has descriptive character based on searched and analyzed facts from the published articles in scientific journals.<h4>Results</h4>The majority of the studies done for the detection of the efficacy of medicinal plants in treating male infertility were done on experimental animals with few clinical studies. However, there is still a need for more studies to have certain results, as conflicting results were noted in different studies done on the effect of the same medicinal plant on spermatogenesis. It might be referred it to the absence of standardization among research models, the difference in extracts, administration route, doses and how long did the experiment last added to differences in the part of the plant used and plant collection. This review summarized the finding of many studies that studied the effect of different medicinal herbs on the testes, epididymis, sperm and prostate parameters, testosterone level and steroidogenesis, erection/ejaculation function and libido.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The protective effect might be due to OLE competence to antagonize the oxidative stress and LPO. Londium suffruticosum I. suffruticosum leaf extract was administered to sub-fertile male rats, subfertility was induced by carbendazim, it resulted in increased spermatogenesis, increased sperm counts, lessened sperm agglutination by preserving normal pH in testicular microenvironment, increasing the testicular oxidative biomarkers, SOD, and CAT. It was found that the main active components of the extract are alkaloids, steroidal lactones and flavonoids."
