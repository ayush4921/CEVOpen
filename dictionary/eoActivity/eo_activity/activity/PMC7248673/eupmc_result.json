    "Worldwide, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is regarded as the major etiological agent of peptic ulcer and gastric carcinoma. Claiming about 50 percent of the world population is infected with H. pylori while therapies for its eradication have failed because of many reasons including the acquired resistance against its antibiotics. Hence, the need to find new anti-H.pylori medications has become a hotspot with the urge of searching for alternative, more potent and safer inhibitors. In the recent drug technology scenario, medicinal plants are suggested as repositories for novel synthetic substances. Hitherto, is considered as ecofriendly, simple, more secure, easy, quick, and less toxic traditional treatment technique. This review is to highlight the anti-H. pylori medicinal plants, secondary metabolites and their mode of action with the aim of documenting such plants before they are effected by cultures and traditions that is expected as necessity."
