    "Combinatory action of antimicrobial agents such as essential oils (EOs) show to be an effective strategy to overcome the problem with increasing antibiotic resistance of microorganisms, including <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. The objective of this study was to evaluate in vitro antimicrobial interactions between <i>Origanum vulgare</i> and <i>Thymus vulgaris</i> EOs against various <i>S.</i><i>aureus</i> strains in both liquid and vapor phases using the broth volatilization checkerboard method. Fractional inhibitory concentrations (FICs) were determined for both liquid and vapor phases, and the composition of EOs was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry using dual-column/dual-detector gas chromatograph. Results of oregano and thyme EOs combination showed additive effects against all <i>S. aureus</i> strains in both phases. In several cases, sums of FICs were lower than 0.6, which can be considered a strong additive interaction. The lowest FICs obtained were 0.53 in the liquid phase and 0.59 in the gaseous phase. Chemical analysis showed that both EOs were composed of many compounds, including carvacrol, thymol, <i>Î³</i>-terpinene, and <i>p</i>-cymene. This is the first report on oregano and thyme EOs interactions against <i>S. aureus</i> in the vapor phase. It also confirms the accuracy of the broth volatilization checkerboard method for the evaluation of combinatory antimicrobial effects of EOs in the vapor phase."
