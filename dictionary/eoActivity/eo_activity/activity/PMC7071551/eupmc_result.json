    "<h4>Background</h4>The use of antibiotics is common, but its excessive or improper use leads to antibiotic resistance. Consequently, scientists have been interested in exploring traditional medicine to identify a new source of anti-bacterial agents. The present study aimed to conduct a systematic review to determine the anti-bacterial activity of <i>Satureja Khuzestanica</i> Jamzad (SKJ) and <i>Zataria Multiflora</i> Boiss (ZM) essential oils against <i>Pseudomonas Aeruginosa</i> in vitro.<h4>Methods</h4>A comprehensive literature search for studies published on SKJ and ZM was carried out. Various keywords (<i>S. Khuzestanica, Marzeh-e-Khuzestani, Z. Multiflora, Z. Multiflora Boiss; avishan-e-shirazi,</i> shirazi thyme, thymol, carvacrol; <i>P. aeruginosa,</i> Iran, antibacterial effect; traditional medicine, phytomedicine, herbal medicine) were used to search both international and Iranian databases (Google Scholar, Science Direct, Web of Science, MEDLINE; PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Academic Search; Journal Storage, Magiran, Irandoc, Scientific Information Database (SID), and IranMedex). The selected articles were published during 2000-2017 and were written in English or Persian.<h4>Results</h4>Seventeen articles were included in the review. The main ingredients of SKJ and ZM plants were carvacrol and thymol. The potential anti-bacterial activity of essential oils from these plants was confirmed. The carvacrol content, as the major active ingredient of SKJ was between 38.33-97.89%. The major ingredients of ZM were carvacrol (16.8-82.7%) followed by thymol (25.70-64.87%). The minimum inhibitory concentration (<i>MIC</i>) value of SKJ and ZM essential oils against bacterial strains was in the range of 0.31-450 and 2-8,000 Î¼g/mL, respectively.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The present review study confirmed the anti-bacterial activity of SKJ and ZM, particularly against <i>Pseudomonas in vitro</i>."
