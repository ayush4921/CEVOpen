This multifaceted secondary metabolite is a red pigment with a common 4-methoxy-2,2 bipyrrole ring system and has a series of close relatives bearing the same structure with different alkyl substituents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Prodigiosin is known to have immunosuppressive, anti-fungal, anti-viral, anti-microbial, anti-malarial, and anti-proliferative properties. It also induces apoptosis in cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The anti-bacterial activity of prodigiosin is attributed to its ability to pass through the outer membrane thereby inhibiting enzymes, like DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV involved in cell growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. There are reports that have revealed prodigiosin&#x02019;s ability of suppressing graft versus host disease in mouse models as well as prevention of collagen-induced arthritis in mouse models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">Pigments are widely used in manufacturing paints, ink, plastics, fabrics, cosmetics, food, etc. Due to technology development, synthetic pigments are produced and used in the fabric industry. Recently, there is a high demand for natural pigments. Natural pigments are mainly obtained from plants and microorganisms. They produce more eco-friendly and sustainable pigments. Microorganisms have been screened and reported to produce secondary metabolites in form of pigments, like carotenoids, melanins, flavins, and phenazines. The toxic nature of artificial pigments have rendered a high demand for microbial pigments which are safer to use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par16"><italic>Serratia</italic>, a Gram-negative organism has widely spread sources such as air, water, soil, plants, fruits, and animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].

Some nutrients, like thiamine and ferric acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], are crucial for enhanced prodigiosin production, while phosphate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], adenosine triphosphate, and ribose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] have shown opposite effect by inhibition of prodigiosin yield. Aniyan and Thomas have suggested use of solid-state fermentation using less liquid medium for pigment production in <italic>Serratia marsescens</italic>. The solid state is known to give high nutrient concentration and availability from the substrate for pigment production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Also, various parameters, like temperature, incubation time, pH, nutrient source, and quorum sensing, are the main factors that have been reported to impact prodigiosin production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Owing to its medicinal and industrial properties, there is a demand to develop high-throughput and cost-effective bioprocesses for prodigiosin production. Selection of inexpensive raw materials is crucial for economically feasible production process of prodigiosin and that accounts for 50% of the total product cost. The rapid increase in industrial waste has developed a need to convert this waste to a value added product with an eco-friendly approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Traditionally, fats, oils, glycerol, and carbohydrates with hydrocarbons and non-hydrocarbon content are used for the growth of pigment producing microorganism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Giri et al. had screened a series of media and discovered that media containing peanut seed and sesame seeds gave significant enhancement of prodigiosin production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].

Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows the optimized parameters suitable for enhanced prodigiosin production. Also, setting up parameters, like pH 7.5, temperature 28&#x02013;30 &#x000b0;C, and 72 h incubation time, gave an enhanced pigment production (Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).

One percent casein hydrolysate revealed higher pigment production as compared to peptone, beef extract, and yeast extract supplements (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Peanut oil seed cake powder supplemented nutrient agar gave maximum production of pigment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Moreover, 4% peanut oil seed cake powder concentration served as rich source of nutrients helping in raised amount of prodigiosin production (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>).

Different media components should be analyzed and compared effectively to deduce the most probable reason for the enhancement or decline in pigment production. The parameters, like carbon source, nitrogen source, fatty acid source, pH, incubation time, temperature, and solvent, were optimized to obtain maximum production of prodigiosin. Keeping this in mind, a media which could support growth of bacteria and at the same time prove efficient to trigger high levels of pigment formation was designed. As the pigment was highly hydrophobic, it could not produce much pigment in liquid medium, solid media was used for its production. Rosenberg et al. have also mentioned about the cell surface hydrophobicity in their study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">While considering the basic role of carbon source in augmenting pigment production, the addition of sucrose and lactose was shown to enhance the pigment yield. The optimum pH for pigment production was determined to be 7.5 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The bacterial isolate elaborated pigment production at 28&#x02013;30 &#x000b0;C, and the rate decreased as temperature increased. The pigment production increased after incubation for 72 h while it decreased after 96 h suggesting that bacteria used the prodigiosin which is a protein as nutrition during stress conditions. Williams and Hussain Quadri had also reported that no pigment was produced when cultures were incubated at 37 &#x000b0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">Several researchers have screened various differential and selective media containing specific carbon sources for enhancing the pigment production. Capryllate thallous agar is one such media which has capryllate as carbon source and thallous salts to avoid contamination. Nakamura and his colleagues have reported use of regular media, like nutrient broth and peptone glycerol broth including 2% sodium oleate which resulted in enhanced pigment production of 0.69 mg/ml [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">Giri et al. has reported the use of powdered sesame seeds in nutrient broth and peptone glycerol media for augmenting growth of <italic>S. marcescens</italic>. The researchers observed that sesame seeds resulted in higher yields of prodigiosin production as compared to other cheaper sources, like peanut and coconut. The researchers screened media for growth at varied temperature parameter for prodigiosin production. They suggested that fatty acids play an important role as a substrate for higher pigment production. It has been observed that various components in the seeds can stimulate the cell density which in turn resulted in higher concentration of positive regulators inside the cell thus triggering excessive pigment production. The maximum pigment was produced at 28 &#x000b0;C and 30 &#x000b0;C in nutrient broth. It was also observed that crushed sesame seed broth resulted in highest pigment production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Similarly, in our study, incorporation of 4% peanut oil seed cake powder in nutrient agar resulted in maximum pigment production (3 mg/ml) at 28 &#x000b0;C after incubating for 72 h.</p><p id="Par35">Cang et al. has reported a medium with ethanol and carbon source resulting in yield up to 3 mg/ml. In his studies, nutrient broth with glucose exhibited a two-fold increase of pigment production at 28 &#x000b0;C. But again, it was observed that enhanced pigment was found in sesame seed broth even without the addition of any sugars. In fact, they observed reduction in the pigment production in sesame seed medium with maltose at 28 &#x000b0;C as compared to only powdered sesame seed broth. The glucose sugar within powdered sesame seed medium showed a radical decrease of pigment at both 28 &#x000b0;C and 30 &#x000b0;C. The results suggested that maltose was a better source of substrate in enhancing pigment production but in nutrient broth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The reason for reduction in pigment release in case of added glucose or maltose might be attributed to the catabolite repression mechanism. Researchers have observed that the addition of glucose to a rich and minimal media inhibited prodigiosin production. The cyclic AMP and CRP regulation of the flagellum were found to be responsible for the secondary metabolite production in <italic>S. marcescens</italic> strain PIC3611 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">In one study, when triolein an unsaturated fatty acid was substituted in the medium, a maximum yield of 0.69 mg/ml of pigment was recovered. Kim et al. in their study also observed that oil gave a better yield over other powdered oil seeds as carbon and nitrogen sources tested. They suggested that the bonded fatty acids as carbon source might less accessible by the organism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">Shahitha et al. in their study screened a similar fatty acid containing substrate called copra (coconut) which has the highest amount of fatty acids followed by peanut and sesame. But, in contrast to other studies, the pigment production was seen to be lesser in the presence of copra. From this fact, they deduced that the presence of 50% lauric and 7% capric acid which is anti-bacterial in nature might have inhibited the growth of <italic>Serratia</italic>. Peanut oil seed cake is a by-product obtained after the extraction of oil. Tekrony have revealed that peanut oil seed cake composition includes 45&#x02013;60% protein, 22&#x02013;30% carbohydrate, 4&#x02013;6% minerals, and 3.8&#x02013;7.5% crude fibre [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Also, peanuts have higher concentration of fatty acids than in sesame seeds and that may result in comparative enhanced pigment production than in sesame seeds as carbon substrate media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">After studying the literature of the composition of published media, there was a need for designing an innovative, nutrition-packed, and economically cheap medium for enhanced prodigiosin biosynthesis. The suitable fatty acid for pigment production was optimized by cultivating the bacteria in thepresence of 2% peanut seeds, sesame seeds, and mustard seeds oilcakes. The powdered peanut oil seed cake gave the highest yield of 3 mg/ml, and this result was compared with existing literature that used different carbon source. This medium is a rich source of minerals, vitamins, proteins saturated, and unsaturated fatty acids. <italic>S. marcescens</italic> is capable of producing a lipolytic enzyme or lipase which has ability to hydrolyse fatty acids in order to use as a carbon source [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Confirmation and characterization of the pigment</title><p id="Par39">The pigment separation and its <italic>R</italic><sub>f</sub> value was determined by thin layer chromatography method using silica gel plates. Vitamin A which is an analog of prodigiosin having pyrrole ring system and also similar molecular weight 333 amu was used as a standard. Two sample extracts in methanol(<italic>R</italic><sub>f</sub> = 0.87) and DMSO (0.89) separately were spotted and showed the same <italic>R</italic><sub>f</sub> value as that vitamin A (0.88) and that of prodigiosin orange red fraction (0.9) as given in literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Similar study was conducted by Someya and his colleagues who tested the prodigiosin content by scrapping off bacterial cells from Luria Bertanni agar plates and by suspending it in 9 ml of ethanol. The centrifuged cell pellets were fractionated by thin layer chromatography. The <italic>R</italic><sub>f</sub> value was then calculated and found to be in the range if 0.9&#x02013;0.95 which is characteristic of the prodigiosin pigment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">The absorbance value of prodigiosin was determined by running an UV-wavelength scan. Prodigiosin pigment has a characteristic absorbance at 537 nm. Two 3 ml sample extracts each were dissolved separately in methanol and DMSO was scanned. Methanol extract showed maximum absorbance at 538 nm while DMSO extract showed absorbance at 539 nm. These results were similar to results obtained by Williams et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Also, Kim et al. in his study has reported that prodigiosin recovered from <italic>Serratia</italic> spp. KH-95 had a maximum absorption spectrum at 535 nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">The mass spectrophotometry analysis showed that compound obtained was 4-methoxy-5(5-methyl-4-pentyl-2H&#x02014;pyrrol-2-ylidene)&#x02014;2,2-bipyrrole ring structure. The mass calculated by GC-MS was found to be around near about 323 m/z. In a similar study conducted by Silva et al., the red pigment produced by <italic>S. marcescens</italic> had an absorbance of 534 nm and molecular weight equal to 323 m/z and was characterized as prodigiosin. Similarly, Yang et al. also reported a prodigiosin produced by <italic>Microcystis aeruginosa</italic> that had a molecular weight of 323 m/z [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par42">Prodigiosin yield was enhanced under optimized conditions. Using oil seed cakes proved to be economical and gave higher yield of prodigiosin. The optimized media especially with 4% peanut oil seed cake powder supplemented nutrient agar gave maximum prodigiosin production. The oil seed cake is known to be power packed with nutrients that might have led to a boost in the pigment production. This promising pigment is known to possess wide medicinal applications due to its anti-proliferative, anti-bacterial, and anti-mycotic activities. Hence, further study will focus on the medical applications of prodigiosin.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AR</term><def><p id="Par4">Analytical reagent</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LB</term><def><p id="Par5">Luria Bertanni</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NB</term><def><p id="Par6">Nutrient broth</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NA</term><def><p id="Par7">Nutrient agar</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>D/W</term><def><p id="Par8">Distilled water</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HCl</term><def><p id="Par9">Hydrochloric acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NaCl</term><def><p id="Par10">Sodium chloride</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DMSO</term><def><p id="Par11">Dimethyl sulfoxide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term><italic>R</italic><sub>f</sub></term><def><p id="Par12">Retardation factor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>amu</term><def><p id="Par13">Atomic mass unit</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>AB performed the experiments and wrote the manuscript.
