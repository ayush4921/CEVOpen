    ":The present study aimed to determine the antimicrobial activity and chemical composition of leaves-extracted essential oil of Leoheo domatiophorus Chaowasku, D.T. Ngo and H.T. Le (L. domatiophorus), including antibacterial, antimycotic, antitrichomonas and antiviral effects. The essential oil was obtained using hydrodistillation, with an average yield of 0.34 ± 0.01% (v/w, dry leaves). There were 52 constituents as identified by GC/MS with available authentic standards, representing 96.74% of the entire leaves oil. The essential oil was comprised of three main components, namely viridiflorene (16.47%), (-)-δ-cadinene(15.58%) and γ-muurolene (8.00%). The oil showed good antimicrobial activities against several species: Gram-positive strains: Staphylococcus aureus (two strains) and Enterococcus faecalis, with Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Lethal Concentration (MLC) values from 0.25 to 1% (v/v); Gram-negative strains such as Escherichia coli (two strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (two strains) and Klebsiella pneumoniae, with MIC and MLC values between 2% and 8% (v/v); and finally Candida species, having MIC and MLC between 0.12 and 4% (v/v).Antitrichomonas activity of the oil was also undertaken, showing IC50, IC90 and MLC values of 0.008%, 0.016% and 0.03% (v/v), respectively, after 48h of incubation. The essential oil resultedin being completely ineffective against tested viruses, ssRNA+ (HIV-1, YFV, BVDV, Sb-1, CV-B4), ssRNA- (hRSVA2, VSV), dsRNA (Reo-1), and dsDNA (HSV-1, VV) viruses with EC50 values over 100 µg/mL. This is the first, yet comprehensive, scientific report about the chemical composition and pharmacological properties of the essential oil in L. domatiophorus."
