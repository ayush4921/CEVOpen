    "The present study aimed to investigate the impact of polylactic acid (PLA) integrated with nanochitosan (NC) composite film and Ziziphora Clinopodioides essential oil (ZCEO) on oxidative spoilage of rainbow trout fillets during a 9-day refrigeration period. For this purpose, first, six degradable films including T1: PLA, T2: PLA + NC, T3: PLA + NC + 1% ZCEO, T4: PLA + NC + 1.5% ZCEO, T5: PLA + 1% ZCEO, and T6: PLA + 1.5% ZCEO were prepared. Next, the properties of the films were investigated. The results of the mechanical tests showed that ZCEO decreased the tensile strength and increased the elongation at the break of the PLA films. However, adding NC improved the mechanical characteristics of the PLA film. The outcomes of physical tests including moisture content (14.02%), solubility (17.41%), water vapor permeability (1.14 × 10<sup>-7</sup> g s<sup>-1</sup> m<sup>-1</sup> Pa<sup>-1</sup>), and oxygen transmission rate (21.54 cm<sup>3</sup>.mm/m<sup>2</sup>.24 hr) showed that adding 1% ZCEO improved the film physical characteristics. Nevertheless, by adding 1.5% concentration EO to the PLA film, the values of water vapor permeability, porosity (according to the scanning electron microscopy), and turbidity increased and cross-sectional pores were observed. Moreover, the films had high antioxidant properties (84.33%). In the next step, the effects of the mentioned films on the oxidative spoilage of rainbow trout fillets were investigated. The results of the chemical analysis in PLA film with the EO compared with the control treatment revealed the increasing trend of oxidation indices, in general. Moreover, increasing the concentration yielded better results such that all treatments containing EO showed satisfactory results up until the storage period ends. In most cases, adding NC affected the mentioned characteristics positively, and the best results were observed in T4 and then in T3. However, based on economics and the better mechanical and physical properties of T3, the film can be applied as an active packaging in fishery products."
