    "Most antibiotics are derived from natural products, like penicillin, as well as recent insecticides, like pyrethroids. Secondary metabolites are produced by plants as ecological chemical mediators, and can therefore possess intrinsic physiological properties against other organisms. These benefits are far from being fully explored. In particular, attention is here focused on the multipurpose neem tree (Azadirachta indica), reporting several experiments of applications in the field of seed oil and neem cake. The latter product seems to be promising because of the low cost, the possible production on a large scale, and the selection of effects in favor of beneficial organisms. Neem cake is able to act on different sites, as required by integrated pest management. Several utilizations of neem products are reported and their potentiality evidenced. Some considerations in this chapter may appear distant from the title of the book, but only by applying the general natural rules can the reason of the single phenomenon be understood. Other studies on resistance mechanisms of Plasmodium are enabling new possible methods of control always based on natural products activity."
