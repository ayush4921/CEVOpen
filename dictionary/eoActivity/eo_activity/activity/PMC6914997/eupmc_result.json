    "Schinus terebinthifolius is a plant well recognized for its therapeutic profile such as anti-inflammatory and antitumor activities, promoting antibacterial activity and antioxidant and antidiabetic properties. This study aimed at examining whether Schinus terebinthifolius memory-enhancing activities are mediated by cholinergic and brain antioxidant systems in a scopolamine zebrafish model. Schinus terebinthifolius essential oil (10, 25, and 50 μL/L) was delivered to zebrafish by immersion in water for 8 days. Memory deficits were induced by scopolamine (100 μM) administration. Zebrafish were divided into seven groups (n = 15/group): vehicle group, scopolamine (100 μM) group, Schinus terebinthifolius essential oil groups (STF; 10, 25, and 50 μL/L), the imipramine group (IMP; 20 mg/L, as the positive control in the NTT test), and the donepezil group (DP; 10 mg/L, as the positive control in the Y-maze test). Memory status was estimated by the novel tank diving test (NTT) and the Y-maze test and finally was validated by comparison with imipramine (20 mg/L) and donepezil (10 mg/L). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to detect oil compounds. Brain levels of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and antioxidant enzymes were measured. After being exposed to Schinus terebinthifolius essential oil, the scopolamine zebrafish exhibited an improvement of memory processes in the NTT and Y-maze tests. The essential oil attenuated the elevated level of AChE and brain oxidative stress. Schinus terebinthifolius essential oil was found to support memory formation through the inhibition of the AChE activity and decreasing oxidative stress in the scopolamine-treated zebrafish brains."
