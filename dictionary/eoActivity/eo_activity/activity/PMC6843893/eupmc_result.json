    "The limited production of bioactive essential oils in natural plants does not meet the increasing worldwide market demand. Plant cell culture technology can be used for the higher production of industrially important essential oils. In the present study, a suitable method for production of essential oils was developed through establishment and elicitation of adventitious roots (AR) in a medicinally important plant Artemisia amygdalina D. The results indicated that leaf explants cultured on solid Murashige and Skoog (MS) media supplemented with 1.0 mg/L α- naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) and 4% sucrose instigated the higher AR induction frequency (90  ±  4.25) and maximum AR biomass (fresh biomass: 17.7 g/L). Furthermore, in the AR when transiently elicited with different elicitors for different time periods, methyl jasmonate (Me-J: 0.5 mg/L) resulted in the higher production of total phenolic content (TPC: 3.6 mg), total flavonoid content (TFC: 2.3 mg) and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL: 4.8 U/g×FW) activity, respectively. Nonetheless, considerable levels of the major bioactive compounds such as α-thujene (6.8%), α-pinene (8.3%), 1,8-cineole (16.2%), camphor (8.4%) and verbenole (10.2%) were recorded in the Me-J treated AR. Thus, a feasible protocol for production of essential oils through AR in A. amygdalina was established, which can be exploited for commercial production of the industrially important terpenes."
