    "<h4>Background</h4>Dental caries is an oral disease which is infectious in nature associated with various pathogenic microorganisms and is prevalent across the world.<h4>Aim</h4>To evaluate and compare the anticariogenic properties of the different plant extracts against various cariogenic microorganisms.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>In phase I, the anticariogenic efficacy of four different herbal extracts, namely <i>Ocimum sanctum</i> (<i>Tulsi</i>), <i>Terminalia chebula</i> (<i>Harad</i>), <i>Tinospora cordifolia</i> (<i>Guduchi</i>), and <i>Glycyrrhiza glabra</i> (Licorice), was evaluated against two strains of bacteria viz. <i>Streptococcus mutans</i> and <i>Lactobacillus acidophilus.</i> In the second phase of the study, the overall decay depth was compared.<h4>Results</h4>In phase I, zone of inhibition was significantly higher in <i>G. glabra</i> (Licorice) followed the descending order by <i>O. sanctum</i> (<i>Tulsi</i>), <i>T. c</i> <i>hebula</i> (<i>Harad</i>), and <i>T. cordifolia</i> (<i>Guduchi</i>), respectively. In the second phase, it was found that the decay depth was significantly higher in <i>T. cordifolia</i> (<i>Guduchi</i>) followed the descending order by <i>T. chebula</i> (<i>Harad</i>), <i>O. sanctum</i> (<i>Tulsi</i>), and <i>G. glabra</i> (Licorice), respectively.<h4>Conclusion</h4><i>Glycyrrhiza glabra</i> (Licorice) extract had potent antibacterial efficacy against <i>S. mutans</i> and <i>L. acidophilus.</i><h4>Clinical significance</h4>Synthetic drugs have many adverse effects, so more attention has been paid to natural remedies because they are safe and effective. Today, the main interest is shifted toward the drugs which is derived from plants, which has led to the screening of many herbal plants for their potential antimicrobial activity and the same can be used clinically as an alternative of synthetic drugs used in dentistry.<h4>How to cite this article</h4>Rai A, Tripathi AM, Saha S, <i>et al</i>.
