    "Abstract In this study, chicory essential oil (CEO) was obtained by hydrodistillation‐based extraction method and it was rich in camphor (31.3%) and phenolic compounds with outstanding antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. The CEO was then incorporated into Lepidium perfoliatum seed mucilage (LPSM) based aqueous solution to prepare an active CEO‐loaded LPSM edible coating. The effect of the edible coating was then investigated on the quality and shelf life of beef slices during 7 days storage at 4°C. The results revealed that beef slice coated with CEO‐loaded LPSM edible coating had a significant inhibitory effect on its lipid oxidation and microbial growth. The CEO‐LPSM coating also inhibited the weight and texture losses of beef slices during display more efficiently compared with the control and CEO‐free LPSM coating. Besides, the beef slices coated with CEO‐LPSM were the preferred samples in terms of sensory scores throughout the storage. Thus, using CEO‐rich LPSM edible coating might inhibit decay and significantly improve the shelf life of fresh beef. The beef slices coated with CEO‐LPSM were the preferred samples in terms of sensory scores throughout the storage. Thus, using CEO‐rich LPSM edible coating might inhibit decay and significantly improve the shelf life of fresh beef."
