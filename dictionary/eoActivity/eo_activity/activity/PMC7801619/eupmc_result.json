    "Aging is correlated with several complex diseases, including type 2 diabetes, neurodegeneration diseases, and cancer. Identifying the nature of this correlation and treatment of age-related diseases has been a major subject of both modern and traditional medicine. Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM) embodies many prescriptions for the treatment of ARDs. Given that autophagy plays a critical role in antiaging processes, the present study aimed to examine whether the documented effect of plants used in TPM might be relevant to the induction of autophagy? To this end, the TPM-based medicinal herbs used in the treatment of the ARDs were identified from modern and traditional references. The known phytochemicals of these plants were then examined against literature for evidence of having autophagy inducing effects. As a result, several plants were identified to have multiple active ingredients, which indeed regulate the autophagy or its upstream pathways. In addition, gene set enrichment analysis of the identified targets confirmed the collective contribution of the identified targets in autophagy regulating processes. Also, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of the targets was reconstructed. Network centrality analysis of the PPI network identified mTOR as the key network hub. Given the well-documented role of mTOR in inhibiting autophagy, our results hence support the hypothesis that the antiaging mechanism of TPM-based medicines might involve autophagy induction. Chemoinformatics study of the phytochemicals using docking and molecular dynamics simulation identified, among other compounds, the cyclo-trijuglone of Juglans regia L. as a potential ATP-competitive inhibitor of mTOR. Our results hence, provide a basis for the study of TPM-based prescriptions using modern tools in the quest for developing synergistic therapies for ARDs."
