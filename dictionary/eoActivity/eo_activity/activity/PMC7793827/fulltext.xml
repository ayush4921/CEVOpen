Increasing the browning of BAT and beige adipose tissue is expected to be a promising strategy for combatting obesity. Through phenotype screening of C3H10-T1/2 mesenchymal stem cells, diphyllin was identified as a promising molecule in promoting brown adipocyte differentiation. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies revealed that diphyllin promoted C3H10-T1/2 cell and primary brown/beige preadipocyte differentiation and thermogenesis, which resulted increased energy consumption. We synthesized the compound and evaluated its effect on metabolism <italic>in vivo</italic>. Chronic experiments revealed that mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) with 100 mg/kg diphyllin had ameliorated oral glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and decreased body weight and fat content ratio. Adaptive thermogenesis in HFD-fed mice under cold stimulation and whole-body energy expenditure were augmented after chronic diphyllin treatment. Diphyllin may be involved in regulating the development of brown and beige adipocytes by inhibiting V-ATPase and reducing intracellular autophagy. This study provides new clues for the discovery of anti-obesity molecules from natural products.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>diphyllin</kwd><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>brown adipocyte</kwd><kwd>differentiation</kwd><kwd>thermogenesis</kwd><kwd>V-ATPase</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="64"/><page-count count="13"/><word-count count="6556"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Obesity has reached epidemic proportions worldwide and is associated with an increased risk of metabolic, cardiovascular and chronic inflammatory diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), hypertension, coronary heart disease and stroke (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The fundamental cause of obesity is the chronic energy imbalance between caloric intake and consumption, where surplus energy is stored in adipose tissue (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Dietary and lifestyle modifications can be effective for the treatment of obesity and the prevention of diabetes. However, these approaches are difficult to maintain in the long term. Efficient ways to increase energy expenditure are urgently needed to combat the escalating occurrence of obesity.</p><p>Adipose tissue is a key organ in the regulation of energy balance. Three functionally different types of adipose tissue are present in mammals: white adipose tissue (WAT), brown adipose tissue (BAT) and brown-like (beige) adipose tissue. White adipose tissue is the primary site of triglyceride storage, but BAT and beige adipose tissue are specialized in energy expenditure and adaptational thermogenesis (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). These three tissues differ in anatomical localization, abundance, maintenance throughout the life of the animal, morphology and mainly function (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The functions of BAT and beige adipose tissue are mediated by uncoupling proteins (UCPs), which are located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. UCP1 uncouples the oxidative phosphorylation process, oxidizing fatty acids and glucose that are produced by triglyceride hydrolysis to generate heat (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Thus, promoting brown/beige adipose browning is now considered a safe strategy to resist obesity and ameliorate metabolic syndromes, such as hyperglycemia and insulin resistance (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Strategies to target the browning of brown/beige adipocytes can be divided into two directions according to the characteristics of brown/beige adipocytes: promoting brown/beige preadipocyte differentiation and increasing thermogenesis of brown/beige fat cells (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). After several decades of research, many transcriptional and epigenetic factors and small molecules have been reported to control brown adipose cell fate and function; these factors include PPAR&#x003b3; (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), PRDM16 (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and PGC1&#x003b1; (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), and external cues include PPAR&#x003b3; agonists (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), catecholamines, and polyphenols (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>Natural products are major sources of new drug leads. Searching for molecules with medicinal value from traditional medicines and discovering new indications of bioactive natural products are important approaches in natural product research. Recently, through <italic>in vitro</italic> screening of compounds from natural sources that regulate energy balance, a variety of phytochemicals [e.g., resveratrol (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), quercetin (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), cyanidin-3-glucoside (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), berberine (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), and gypenosides (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>)] have been reported to be able to increase energy expenditure and curb obesity and its complications by promoting adipose tissue differentiation and/or thermogenesis capacity.</p><p>Aryl naphthalene lignans (ANLs) are widely distributed in dietary or medicinal plants and exhibit excellent biological activities, such as antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antiviral and anticancer activities (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). In addition, some herbs with ANLs were used as folk medicine for adjuvant therapy of diabetes, such as <italic>Cordia rufescens</italic> (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Researchers of <italic>Shionogi</italic> &#x00026; <italic>Co., Ltd.</italic> reported that S-8921 and S-8921G, two synthetic ANLs, exhibited significant hypocholesterolemic effects <italic>in vivo</italic>, which expanded the application of lignans to metabolic diseases (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Inspired by the potential effects of these ANLs on glycolipid metabolism, an <italic>in vitro</italic> assay based on the effect of browning differentiation in C3H10-T1/2 mesenchymal stem cells were used to evaluate the glycolipid metabolism regulation effects of the ANLs in our natural product library. Interestingly, diphyllin, a common ANL, significantly promoted browning adipogenesis and thermogenesis in adipocytes and increased oxygen consumption under a nontoxic dosage in both C3H10-T1/2 mesenchymal stem cells and primary brown/beige adipocytes. Further investigations revealed that diphyllin reduced obesity and improved the glucose tolerance capacity in high-fat diet-fed C57BL/6J mice. There is less experimental research concerning the effects of these ANLs on glycolipid metabolism. This study may expand new applications of these lignans in metabolic diseases and provide an opportunity to develop a new class of agent against obesity or related diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Materials</title><p>The antibody sources were as follows: UCP-1 (Abclonal, A5857), PRDM16 (Abcam, ab106410), PGC-1&#x003b1; (Calbiochem, ST1202), &#x003b2;-actin (Abgent, AM1021B), Cide-A (Santa Cruz, sc-293289), PPAR&#x003b3; (Abcam, ab178860), adiponectin (AdipoQ) (Abcam, ab62551), FABP4 (Cell Signaling, #2120), LC3 (Proteintech, 14600-1-AP), and p62 (SQSTM1) (MBL, PM045).

Diphyllin was previously reported as a V-ATPase inhibitor, which decreases the internal pH (pHi) and reverses the transmembrane pH gradient, inhibits the proliferation and induces the apoptosis of cancer cells and abrogates acidification of the osteoclastic resorption lacunae and bone resorption (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). V-ATPase activity as a proton pump is required for acidification of a wide array of different organelles in eukaryotes (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). In mammalian cells, V-ATPase proton pumps are the primary pH regulators that maintain intravascular and/or extracellular pondus hydrogenii (pH). The V-ATPase complex is mainly responsible for lysosomal acidification. Recent reports implicate altered V-ATPase activity and lysosomal pH dysregulation in cellular aging, longevity, and adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases, including forms of Parkinson&#x02019;s disease and Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Ohsumi et&#x000a0;al. tested whether vacuolar acidification was required for autophagy in yeast by following the accumulation of autophagic bodies in the vacuoles of wild-type and vma-mutant (V-ATPase deficient) cells and their subsequent degradation. This study confirmed that V-ATPase activity is required for the final step of autophagy, that is, the breakdown of cargo delivered to the vacuole (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Genetic defects in V-ATPase subunits or V-ATPase-related proteins are increasingly seen in lipid metabolism dysregulation (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>) and in association with a decrease in autophagy in the late phase (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Lysosome-related autophagy regulates brown adipocyte function. Chloroquine, a weak lysosomotropic base that blocks the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, blocked dexamethasone-induced brown adipose tissue whitening and decreased the fat mass content in dexamethasone-treated mice (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Bafilomycin, the autophagy repressor target of V-ATPase, increases UCP1 protein expression in primary preadipocytes (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). These studies reveal that V-ATPase activity and lysosomes regulate brown/beige cell fate and function.</p><p>As inhibiting V-ATPase causes lysosomal deacidification, leading to decreased autophagy flux through autophagosome-lysosome fusion (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>), resulting in the accumulation of Microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) and sequestosome 1 (p62) (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). We tested the acidification of lysosomes using LysoSensor&#x02122; Yellow/Blue DND-160, an acidophilic lysosome shuttle probe, and diphyllin-treated cells showed lower yellow dye deposition than the controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">
<bold>Figure S7A</bold>
</xref>). Autophagy flux was tested with the tandem GFP-RFP-LC3 adenovirus, which represents autophagosome formation as previously described (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). We also observed decreased autophagy flux and an accumulation of LC3 and p62 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">
<bold>Figures S7B, C</bold>
</xref>). This suggests that diphyllin may be involved in regulating the development of brown and beige adipocytes by inhibiting V-ATPase and reducing intracellular autophagy.</p><p>Autophagy for non-selective bulk degradation of proteins and lipids through the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes is suggested as one of the major types of autophagy in adipocytes (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Many studies have shown that autophagy plays an important role in adipogenesis, activation and maintenance of brown/beige adipocytes. An adipocyte-specific mouse knockout of Atg7 increased features of brown adipocytes, which, along with an increase in normal brown adipose tissue, led to an elevated rate of fatty acid beta-oxidation and a lean body mass (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). Inhibition of autophagy in brown adipocytes leads to an increase in UCP1 protein and mitochondrial density, causing more uncoupled respiration and OXPHOS, suggesting a repressing role for autophagy in the activity of the BAT thermogenic machinery (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). Autophagy is needed to convert beige adipocytes to WAT upon removal of &#x003b2;3-AR agonists or recovery from cold exposure, revealing that autophagy plays a negative role in beige adipocyte maintenance (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). It seems that a good anti-obesity strategy would be to inhibit autophagy, but due to inhibition of autophagy seeming detrimental in hypermetabolic conditions such as hepatic steatosis, atherosclerosis, thermal injury, sepsis, and cachexia through an increase in free fatty acid and glycerol release from WAT, the emerging concept of white fat browning&#x02013;conversion to beige/brown fat has been controversial in its anti-obesity effect through facilitation of weight loss and improvement in metabolic health (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>).</p><p>In summary, diphyllin improved brown and beige adipocyte differentiation and thermogenesis. Moreover, chronic diphyllin administration alleviated diet-induced obesity by promoting the browning process in brown adipose tissues, inguinal and epididymal white adipose tissues. These results revealed that diphyllin is a promising lead compound for the treatment of obesity and related diseases, and the lead molecule deserves to be further studied.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s5"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">
