    "Bioassays guided phytochemical investigations on the ethyl acetate-soluble fraction of the root material of Ballota pseudodictamnus (L.) Benth. led to the isolation of two new compounds, ballodiolic acid A (1) and ballodiolic acid B (2), along with three known compounds ballodiolic acid (3), ballotenic acid (4), and β-amyrin (5), which were also isolated for the first time from this species by using multiple chromatographic techniques. The structures of the compounds (1–5) were determined by modern spectroscopic analysis including 1D and 2D NMR techniques and chemical studies. In three separate experiments, the isolated compounds (1–5) demonstrated potent antioxidant scavenging activity, with IC50 values ranging from 07.22–34.10 μM in the hydroxyl radical (•OH) inhibitory activity test, 58.10–148.55 μM in the total ROS (reactive oxygen species) inhibitory activity test, and 6.23–69.01 μM in the peroxynitrite (ONOO−) scavenging activity test. With IC50 values of (07.22 ± 0.03, 58.10 ± 0.07, 6.23 ± 0.04 μM) for •OH, total ROS, and scavenge ONOO−, respectively, ballodiolic acid B (2) showed the highest scavenging ability. Antibacterial and antifungal behaviors were also exposed to the pure compounds 1–5. In contrast to compounds 4 and 5, compounds 1–3 were active against all bacterial strains studied, with a good zone of inhibition proving these as a potent antibacterial agent. Similarly, compared to compounds 3–5, compounds 1 and 2 with a 47 percent and 45 percent respective inhibition zone were found to be more active against tested fungal strains."
