However, the molecular mechanism of these effects remains unclear. Our study aimed to systematically examine the effects of flos puerariae crude extract (FPE) as an anti-diabetic agent using in vitro assays. The cytotoxicity of FPE was evaluated using MTS assay in L6 rat myocyte and 3T3-L1 murine fibroblast cell lines. PPAR&#x003b3; binding activity and adipogenesis were examined using dual-luciferase and differentiation assays, respectively. For investigating the anti-diabetic activity, glucose utilization, including GLUT4 protein expression, glucose uptake assay, and GLUT4 translocation using immunofluorescence microscopy were conducted in L6 cells. Furthermore, we assessed the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of FPE. Our results demonstrated the ability to augment glucose uptake in L6 cells and enhance glucose utilization activity by increasing the expression of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4). In summary, our findings suggest that FPE may be a potential anti-diabetic substance for the treatment of diabetic patients and can prevent inflammatory or oxidation-related diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>flos puerariae</kwd><kwd>PPAR&#x003b3;</kwd><kwd>GLUT4</kwd><kwd>antioxidant</kwd><kwd>iNOS</kwd><kwd>COX2</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-molecules-25-03970"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic condition with a rapidly increasing prevalence worldwide, currently affecting hundreds of millions of people. This multifactorial disease is characterized by hyperglycemia, insulin deficiency, insulin resistance, and/or abnormal insulin secretion. Diabetes can be classified into four categories: type 1 diabetes (T1DM), type 2 diabetes (T2DM), gestational mellitus (GDM), and other specific types of diabetes due to other causes. T2DM is characterized by impaired insulin-mediated glucose clearance in the skeletal muscle, but not always accompanied by dysregulation of hepatic glucose production by insulin. Insulin has dual roles in controlling postprandial glycemia response to a meal and activation of glucose transport into skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, both of which are impaired in T2DM [<xref rid="B1-molecules-25-03970" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Potential drugs for treatment of T2DM should preferably improve insulin resistance, correct dyslipidemia, and preserve pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell function. Regulation of gene expression in these pathophysiological conditions is activated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) that bind to either natural or synthetic ligands. Different subtypes of PPARs including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR&#x003b1;), PPAR&#x003b2;, and PPAR&#x003b3; have been identified [<xref rid="B2-molecules-25-03970" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Among these, PPAR&#x003b3; functions as a ligand-activated transcription factor and plays an important role in the regulation of adipogenic differentiation, glucose metabolism, insulin resistance, and inflammation [<xref rid="B1-molecules-25-03970" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B3-molecules-25-03970" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Upon being bound by agonists, PPAR&#x003b3; heterodimerizes with retinoid X receptor-&#x003b1; and activates the transcription of target genes by binding to the peroxisome proliferator hormone response elements (PPRE) [<xref rid="B3-molecules-25-03970" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. PPAR&#x003b3; is a key regulator of lipid and glucose metabolism and, therefore, its synthetic ligands such as glitazones, derivatives of thiazolidinediones (TZDs), improve insulin and glucose parameters and increase whole body insulin sensitivity. Thus, these are called insulin-sensitizing medications and are used in the treatment of T2DM. Synthetic drugs of the TZDs of anti-diabetic drugs efficiently bind to PPAR&#x003b3;; however, these treatments have various degrees of side effects. For instance, full agonists such as TZD drugs are clinically effective in treating T2DM; however, adverse drug effects such as fluid retention, edema, bone loss, liver toxicity, and weight gain have been reported. The mechanism underlying the anti-diabetic effects of TZD drugs also involve activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) by TZDs, resulting in the phosphorylation of PPAR&#x003b3;, leading to expression of specific genes linked to insulin sensitivity, such as adiponectin and adipsin [<xref rid="B4-molecules-25-03970" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Given the side effects of the current pharmacological treatments, it is necessary to identify safer agents for the treatment of DM, including remedies that may be more efficacious.</p><p>Traditional medicinal plants have an extensive history in the treatment of diseases and often offer promising leads for the treatment of T2DM. Increasing attention is being given to these resources for their complementary therapeutic effects that supplement western medicine. Notably, ethno-pharmacological studies have identified traditional remedies that might provide advantages in treatment with relatively fewer side effects, better patient tolerance in diverse cultural contexts, lesser toxicity, and lower costs, as compared to modern drugs.</p><p><italic>P. lobata</italic> is a traditional medicinal plant that has been widely used in clinics for over thousands of years. Modern pharmacological studies have reported that <italic>P. lobata</italic> extracts have various therapeutic effects in cardiovascular disorders, osteoporosis, hypocholesterolemia, liver injury, and cancer, as well as other hyperglycemic defects [<xref rid="B5-molecules-25-03970" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-molecules-25-03970" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-molecules-25-03970" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It has been reported that the main compositions of flos puerariae are tectorigenin, saponins, and isoflavonoids [<xref rid="B8-molecules-25-03970" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-molecules-25-03970" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-molecules-25-03970" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>In hyperglycemic studies, the root of <italic>P. lobata</italic> is capable of reducing the blood glucose levels in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice, preventing pancreatic cells from the toxic action of reactive oxygen species [<xref rid="B5-molecules-25-03970" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B11-molecules-25-03970" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, the biological activity of <italic>P. lobata</italic> flowers has not been investigated in detail. Recently, a few studies indicated that flos puerariae has a protective effect against diseases, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [<xref rid="B12-molecules-25-03970" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and also shows anti-mutagenic activity [<xref rid="B13-molecules-25-03970" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Furthermore, a single bioactive compound, <italic>Puerarin,</italic> isolated from <italic>P. lobata</italic> has been shown to prevent damage caused by free radicals and increase the activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase during oxidative stress [<xref rid="B14-molecules-25-03970" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Thus, it is important to explore how flos puerariae affects anti-diabetic signaling.</p><p>In this study, we identified the extract of <italic>P. lobata</italic> flowers as a strong PPAR&#x003b3; agonist among other tested plant extracts. We further found that these extracts exhibit anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities in macrophages and favor glucose uptake activity in muscle cells. Thus, we postulate that flos puerariae may represent a beneficial therapeutic agent for T2DM.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-molecules-25-03970"><title>2.

To quantitate the amount of lipid accumulation in each sample, we measured the OD of each treatment. The untreated 3T3-L1 preadipocytes showed an OD value of 0.323 &#x000b1; 0.004, while the untreated mature adipocytes recorded an OD value of 0.408 &#x000b1; 0.017. The ODs of the 10, 50, and 100 &#x000b5;g/mL FPE-treated cells were 0.497 &#x000b1; 0.020, 0.511 &#x000b1; 0.031, and 0.514 &#x000b1; 0.022, respectively, which were significantly different from those of untreated 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and untreated mature adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03970-f002">Figure 2</xref>C). Higher OD values indicate enhanced differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into mature adipocytes. Therefore, this result indicates that FPE increased the adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes in a dose-dependent manner, indirectly indicating that FPE works as a PPAR&#x003b3; ligand during preadipocyte differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-molecules-25-03970"><title>3.3. Effect of Flos Puerariae Extract on Glucose Utilization</title><p>L6 cells were treated with FPE to determine its cytotoxicity on the cells. After treatment with 100 &#x003bc;g/mL FPE for up to three days, there was no significant difference with respect to cell growth, indicating that FPE is a safe extract for L6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03970-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). The effects of FPE on the glucose utilizing activity of L6 myocytes were determined by assaying GLUT4 protein expression, GLUT4 trafficking, and glucose uptake activity. To measure GLUT4 protein expression, we performed an immunoblotting assay and found that the relative ratio of GLUT4 protein expression as compared to untreated L6 myocytes increased in a dose-dependent manner with increasing concentrations of FPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03970-f003">Figure 3</xref>B&#x02013;C). Upon measuring glucose uptake, the relative ratios in cells treated with 6 &#x000b5;g/mL insulin were found to be 2.545 &#x000b1; 0.036-fold as compared to untreated L6 myocytes. In case of FPE treatment, the relative ratios were found to be 1.281 &#x000b1; 0.210, 1.695 &#x000b1; 0.175, and 1.740 &#x000b1; 0.129-fold in samples treated with 10, 50, and 100 &#x000b5;g/mL FPE, respectively, as compared to the untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03970-f003">Figure 3</xref>D). Immunofluorescence was conducted using a fluorescence microscope to investigate GLUT4 protein trafficking. We found that L6 cells co-treatment with 100 nM insulin and 100 &#x000b5;g/mL FPE increased the amount of translocated protein from the cytoplasm to the membrane, as compared to untreated L6 myocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03970-f003">Figure 3</xref>E). Our results indicate that FPE had the ability to affect glucose trafficking in L6 myocytes in a dose-dependent manner.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-molecules-25-03970"><title>3.4. Antioxidant Activity of Flos Puerariae Extracts</title><p>DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activities were measured to determine the antioxidant capacity of FPE at different concentrations. The ability to reduce ABTS was found to be higher at the higher concentrations of FPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03970-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). The VCEAC of FPE was found to be 179.639 &#x000b1; 16.151 mg/g dry weight, whereas percentages of ABTS scavenging activity were 38.421 &#x000b1; 1.708, 58.865 &#x000b1; 1.299, 77.112 &#x000b1; 0.452, 88.129 &#x000b1; 0.358, and 93.288 &#x000b1; 0.066 for 62.5, 125, 250, 500, and 1000 &#x000b5;g/mL FPE, respectively. In the case of DPPH radical scavenging activity, we observed a similar result, i.e., the IC<sub>50</sub> of FPE was 882.267 &#x000b1; 52.726 &#x000b5;g/mL and the percentages of DPPH scavenging activity were 9.361 &#x000b1; 2.000, 16.052 &#x000b1; 3.389, 28.618 &#x000b1; 6.374, 48.905 &#x000b1; 8.638, and 57.363 &#x000b1; 9.587 for 62.5, 125, 250, 500, and 1000 &#x000b5;g/mL FPE, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03970-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). To confirm FPE&#x02019;s antioxidant activity, a luciferase construct containing antioxidant response element (ARE) was transfected into Raw264.7 cell lines. FPE treatment in the transfected cells resulted in increased luciferase activity, indicating that FPE may activate NRF2 protein followed by activation of ARE promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03970-f004">Figure 4</xref>C). Trans-Chalcone (25 &#x003bc;M) was used as a positive control for the antioxidant activity. The calculated relative ratio of ARE-luciferase activity was 5.652 &#x000b1; 0.299-fold for positive control and 2.049 &#x000b1; 0.139, 2.152 &#x000b1; 0.173, and 2.877 &#x000b1; 0.137-fold for 10, 50, and 100 &#x003bc;g/mL FPE-treated cells, respectively, compared to untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03970-f004">Figure 4</xref>C).</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot5-molecules-25-03970"><title>3.5. Anti-Inflammatory Activity of Flos Puerariae Extracts</title><p>To assess the anti-inflammatory effects of FPE, we conducted several assays, including immunoblotting and nitric oxide assay. Upon performing immunoblotting, we found that the expression levels of iNOS and COX-2 increased following treatment with 1 &#x000b5;g/mL LPS; however, FPE treatment was found to abolish the LPS-induced increase in iNOS and COX2 protein expression. These effects were dose-dependent, as shown by treatment with 10, 50, and 100 &#x000b5;g/mL FPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03970-f005">Figure 5</xref>A). To determine the nitrate concentration, we performed a nitric oxide assay using RAW264.7 cells. LPS treated-cells displayed a 1.744 &#x000b1; 0.094-fold increase in the nitrate levels; however, the amount of nitrate was found to be diminished upon FPE treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03970-f005">Figure 5</xref>B). Finally, the HO-1 expression level was measured in RAW264.7 cells, following FPE treatment. FPE increases HO-1 expression in a dose-dependent manner, but not Cu/ZnSOD, indicating that FPE may have a unique pathway to enhance antioxidant activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03970-f005">Figure 5</xref>C). Finally, we performed the HPLC method to detect bioactive compounds in FPE. Four bioactive compounds, probably existing in FPE were examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03970-f006">Figure 6</xref>A). Although no detectable amounts of Peurarin (major of compound in P. lobate root) and Rutin were identified, we found the FPE to contain apigenin and genistein, which may play roles in anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic activities.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4-molecules-25-03970"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>Numerous potential plant extracts have been used for the treatment/prevention of various diseases, including DM. PPAR&#x003b3; acts as a receptor for molecules with anti-diabetic properties and is also capable of modulating adipogenesis; thus, plant extracts as well as single compounds are assayed for their PPAR&#x003b3; binding activity to screen those with a potential role in controlling diabetes. The present study demonstrates that the extract from flos puerariae exhibits in vitro anti-diabetic activity in a dose-dependent manner, as assessed by PPAR&#x003b3; binding activity assay, glucose utilization in L6 myocytes, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, and enhancement of adipogenesis by accumulating lipid droplets in 3T3-L1 cells.</p><p>The current available treatments for T2DM act through diverse mechanisms to improve glycemia. Many of these treatments also exert anti-inflammatory and/or antioxidant effects that might be mediated via their metabolic effects on hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia or by directly modulating the response of immune system. Part of these findings regarding the effects of different medications on systemic and tissue-specific inflammation have been obtained using in vitro or in vivo models.</p><p>In mammalian cells, the facilitative diffusion of glucose across the plasma membrane is mediated by a family of glucose transporters. GLUT4, one of the glucose transporter isoforms, is only expressed in peripheral tissues that are targets for insulin action, including adipose tissue, cardiac muscle, and skeletal muscle. In in vivo models, transgenic mice that express high GLUT4 level in adipose tissue [<xref rid="B17-molecules-25-03970" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] or in skeleton muscle [<xref rid="B18-molecules-25-03970" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] are both highly insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. In contrast, mice with ablation of GLUT4, specifically in the muscle, show the expression of insulin resistance and diabetes from a young age. Originally, insulin resistance occurs in the skeleton muscle; however, later on, these mice become insulin resistant not only in the adipose tissue but also the liver [<xref rid="B19-molecules-25-03970" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-molecules-25-03970" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Upon acute stimulation by insulin, GLUT4 transporters translocate from their intracellular compartment to the plasma membrane and, therefore, are responsible for insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. In the present study, glucose uptake was seen upon treatment of L6 cells with FPE; this is probably a result of GLUT4 translocation as shown by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03970-f003">Figure 3</xref>E). FPE increased the expression levels of GLUT4 as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03970-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). Overall, FPE shows anti-diabetic activity by increasing GLUT4 expression, followed by enhancing translocation as well as glucose uptake.</p><p>Chronic inflammation contributes to the development of many diseases, including cancer, arthritis, heart disease, and diabetes and its complications. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is a key molecule that increases the inflammatory status of cells leading to pathophysiological conditions by increasing prostaglandin formation. It also leads to excessive formation of reactive oxygen species [<xref rid="B21-molecules-25-03970" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Persistent hyperglycemia and a chronic inflammatory environment lead to oxidation-mediated stress and injury and also alter insulin sensitivity by triggering different key steps in the insulin-signaling pathway [<xref rid="B22-molecules-25-03970" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, members of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug class, have been shown the ability to alleviate the augmented inflammatory responses in several models of diabetes [<xref rid="B23-molecules-25-03970" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-molecules-25-03970" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-molecules-25-03970" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, their adverse effects on targets, including impaired renal perfusion and its function, peptic ulcers, and enhanced risk of myocardial infarction, contribute to limited use of these drugs for clinical prevention/treatment of T2DM [<xref rid="B23-molecules-25-03970" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Furthermore, several studies on T1DM and T2DM report increased formation of free radicals and decreased antioxidant capacity in the disease condition, which contribute to oxidative stress that damages cells [<xref rid="B26-molecules-25-03970" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Thus, anti-inflammation and antioxidant activities of any extract or compound can be beneficial for diabetic patients. In addition to COX-2 and iNOS protein expression, we observed that FPE induced the expression of HO-1 protein. HO-1, mostly studied for its cytoprotective properties in conditions associated with inflammation and oxidative stress, is an inducible rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes free heme into carbon monoxide, free iron, and biliverdin [<xref rid="B27-molecules-25-03970" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-molecules-25-03970" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-molecules-25-03970" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-molecules-25-03970" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. It has also been reported that dysregulation of the HO-1 system is associated with several inflammatory disorders, such as atherosclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis [<xref rid="B27-molecules-25-03970" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], suggesting that HO-1 is also a potent anti-inflammatory mediator and shows the potential to be a molecular target for FPE in mediating its anti-inflammatory activity. Treatment with LPS has been shown to induce the production of NO in macrophage cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03970-f005">Figure 5</xref>A) as well as adipocyte cells [<xref rid="B31-molecules-25-03970" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. To investigate whether FPE alleviates insulin resistance by inhibiting NO production, we measured nitrite concentration in Raw264.7 cells and found FPE to be capable of decreasing NO production in macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03970-f005">Figure 5</xref>B). These results suggest that FPE reduces insulin resistance, probably through reduction in NO levels, which could alleviate the impairment in the insulin-signaling cascade. Thus, it indirectly exhibits potential properties that could prevent diabetic complications caused by inflammatory and oxidative stress.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-molecules-25-03970"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>There are various molecular targets for T2DM treatments such as the IRS1/PI3K/Akt pathway, AMPK pathway, and the GLP-1 pathway. Our study showed that FPE activates the PPAR&#x003b3; nuclear receptor as a ligand and exhibits anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities upon treatment in cells. It also affects glucose metabolism by increasing GLUT4 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03970-f006">Figure 6</xref>B).
