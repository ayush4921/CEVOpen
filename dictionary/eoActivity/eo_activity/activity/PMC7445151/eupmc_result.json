    "<h4>Background</h4>Coronaviruses are responsible for several human diseases, such as the infectious novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). <i>Nigella sativa</i> is a natural food supplement with a known safety profile that may provide a wealth of documented antiviral compounds.<h4>Objective</h4>To explore the studies supporting the <i>N sativa</i> potential for hitting SARS-CoV-2 targets.<h4>Methods</h4>A literature search for published or preprint in silico studies between 1990 and 2020 in electronic databases (PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, and Google Scholar) was performed for the terms Nigella sativa, <i>black seed, coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2</i>, and <i>COVID-19</i>.<h4>Results</h4>At least 8 in silico studies have shown that some compounds of <i>N sativa</i>, including nigelledine, Î±-hederin, hederagenin, thymohydroquinone, and thymoquinone, had high to moderate affinity with SARS-CoV-2 enzymes and proteins. These compounds may potentially inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication and <i>attachment to host cell receptors</i>.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These preliminary data of in silico studies propose <i>N sativa</i> as a potential phytotherapy candidate for COVID-19. Further preclinical experimental evidence is required followed by a Phase I clinical trial. (<i>Curr Ther Res Clin Exp</i>. 2020; 81:XXX-XXX)."
