    "This study investigated the <i>in vitro</i> effects of Greek oregano and garlic essential oils on inhibition of <i>Eimeria</i> parasites and their <i>in vivo</i> effects on production performance, intestinal bacteria counts, and oocyst output. An inhibition assay was performed <i>in vitro</i> using <i>Eimeria tenella</i> Wisconsin strain sporozoites and Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells. Intracellular sporozoite invasion was quantified by detection of <i>E. tenella</i> DNA using qPCR from cell monolayers harvested at 2 and 24 h post-infection. Parasite invasion was inhibited by the oregano essential oil at the concentration of 100 μg/ml by 83 or 93% after 2 or 24 h, respectively. Garlic essential oil reached a maximum inhibition of 70% after 24 h with the 50 μg/ml concentration. Normal morphology was observed in MDBK cells exposed to concentrations of 100 μl/ml of garlic or oregano for over 24 h. In the <i>in vivo</i> trial, 180 male broiler chicks (45.3 ± 0.7 g) were allocated into two treatments (6 pens of 15 chicks per treatment). Control treatment was fed commercial diets without antibiotics or anticoccidials. The ORE-GAR treatment was fed the same control diets, further supplemented with a premix (1 g/kg feed) containing the oregano (50 g/kg premix) and garlic (5 g/kg premix) essential oils. At day 37, all birds were slaughtered under commercial conditions, and intestinal samples were collected. ORE-GAR treatment had improved final body weight (1833.9 vs. 1.685.9 g; <i>p</i> < 0.01), improved feed conversion ratio (1.489 vs. 1.569; <i>p</i> < 0.01), and reduced fecal oocyst excretion (day 28: 3.672 vs. 3.989 log oocysts/g, <i>p</i> < 0.01; day 37: 3.475 vs. 4.007 log oocysts/g, <i>p</i> < 0.001). In the caecal digesta, ORE-GAR treatment had lower total anaerobe counts (8.216 vs. 8.824 CFU/g; p < 0.01), whereas in the jejunum digesta the ORE-GAR treatment had higher counts of <i>E. coli</i> (5.030 vs. 3.530 CFU/g; <i>p</i> = 0.01) and <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> (5.341 vs. 3.829 CFU/g; <i>p</i> < 0.01), and lower counts of <i>Clostridium perfringens</i> (2.555 vs. 2.882 CFU/g; <i>p</i> < 0.01). In conclusion, the combined supplementation of oregano and garlic essential oils had a potent anticoccidial effect <i>in vitro</i> and a growth-promoting effect in broilers reared in the absence of anticoccidial drugs."
