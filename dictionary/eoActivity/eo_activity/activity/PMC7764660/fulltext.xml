Considering the anti-inflammatory effects of turmeric, we formulated a nano-emulsion of turmeric infused in edible sesame oil, with a globule size of 200&#x02013;250 nm using high-energy microfluidization. The product with a zeta potential of &#x02212;11.5 mV showed spherical globules when imaged for scanning and transmission electron microscopy. We explored the anti-inflammatory potential of this edible nano-emulsion in lung inflammation. The lungs are the internal organ most vulnerable to infection, injury, and rapid inflammation from the external environment because of their constant exposure to pollutants, pathogenic microorganisms, and viruses. We evaluated the nano-emulsion for efficacy in ovalbumin-induced lung injury in mice with an oral treatment for two weeks. The therapeutic effect of nano-emulsion of the sesame oil-extract of turmeric was evident from biochemical analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, lung histopathology, and flow cytometric analysis. The developed nano-emulsion significantly reduced the inflammation and damage to the alveolar network in ovalbumin-injured mice. Significant reduction in the levels of neutrophils and inflammatory cytokines like IL-4, IL-6, and IL-13 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was observed in the nano-emulsion-treated group. Leukotriene B4 and IgE were also significantly altered in the treated group, thus suggesting the suitability of the formulation for the treatment of allergy and other inflammatory conditions. The nano-emulsification process potentiated the immunoregulatory effect of turmeric, as observed from the elevated levels of the natural anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10. The dietary constituents-based nano-emulsion of spice turmeric helped in scavenging the free radicals in the injured lungs, thus modulating the inflammation pathway. This easily scalable formulation technology approach can therefore serve as a potential noninvasive and safe treatment modality for reducing lung inflammation in lung injury cases.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>lung injury</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>allergy</kwd><kwd>cytokines</kwd><kwd>turmeric</kwd><kwd>curcuminoids</kwd><kwd>sesame oil</kwd><kwd>nano-emulsion</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-pharmaceutics-12-01206"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Lung inflammation, a complex biological process, however, occurs frequently in response to external airborne toxic stimuli and results in substantial cell injury [<xref rid="B1-pharmaceutics-12-01206" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Aerosolized environmental pollutants, bacteria, viruses, nanoengineered non-biodegradable particles like carbon nanotubes, and ultrafine particles like titanium dioxide and quantum dots cause inflammation of the respiratory airways, as well as deep alveoli, pulmonary edema, and alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis [<xref rid="B2-pharmaceutics-12-01206" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Inflammation can be acute, as seen in acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome, causing the rapid migration of neutrophils to the lung production of reactive oxygen species and secreting several enzymes like matrix metalloproteinases, and proteases for the degradation of invading toxins that also cause damage to alveoli [<xref rid="B3-pharmaceutics-12-01206" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The unusual and out-of-control response by the immune system results in a cytokine storm, as observed in the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which is an unfortunate therapeutic intervention [<xref rid="B4-pharmaceutics-12-01206" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Exposure to environmental pollutants like cigarette smoke, mycotoxins from fungal spores, and infection by respiratory viruses also cause chronic inflammatory diseases like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases [<xref rid="B5-pharmaceutics-12-01206" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-pharmaceutics-12-01206" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-pharmaceutics-12-01206" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Steroids are potent anti-inflammatory medicines commonly prescribed for the treatment of lung inflammation and are administered systemically for maximizing the therapeutic effect. Although highly potent, steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs exert high mineralocorticoid effects, necessitating precautions during systemic therapy. Oral delivery, being the most acceptable noninvasive route of administration, is preferred by the patients for the treatment of chronic diseases and will have fewer side effects too. Since time immemorial, the therapeutic effects of plants have been well recognized and are thus a part of therapy, as well as nutrition. From the knowledge of the impact of several dietary nutrients acting on multiple molecular targets, it is possible to design an anti-inflammatory formulation based on common dietary constituents that will offer a unique and traditional pharmacological approach in treating the complex chronic inflammatory lung degenerative diseases. We have designed a nano-emulsion of sesame oil infused with curcuminoids extracted from the pristine and raw form of turmeric, the Golden spice, because nano-emulsion is the safe and effective way of delivery of a poorly soluble and poorly permeable drug to the specific site. Sesame oil is the common dietary constituent used in the Indian food system and has therapeutic potential as an antioxidant and neuroprotective. It is the most common vehicle used for oil-based medications in the Ayurvedic system of Medicine [<xref rid="B8-pharmaceutics-12-01206" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Turmeric is a rich source of curcuminoids with proven safety and efficacy profiles, especially in the treatment of inflammatory conditions [<xref rid="B9-pharmaceutics-12-01206" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The novel nano-emulsion of sesame oil extract of turmeric constituents, made by high shear technology, is a safe and effective, bed-to-bench side approach for easy clinical translation and industrial scalability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2-pharmaceutics-12-01206"><title>2.

Leukocyte Count in BALF</title><p>In OVA-induced pulmonary inflammation, significant increases in the total number of neutrophils, eosinophils, and mononuclear cells were observed.

The OVA group showed a significant increase in the number of inflammatory cells observed compared to the normal control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-12-01206-f005">Figure 5</xref>). The total number of leukocytes in each group was expressed as cell count &#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup>/mL BALF. The inflammation is related to the presence of eosinophils, which is also an indication for asthma. The total count of different cells consisting of eosinophils in BALF was reduced by treatment with SO (13 &#x000b1; 1.4), TUR (12 &#x000b1; 1.2), and nano-emulsion (7.8 &#x000b1; 1.5) &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>/mL BALF.

Measurement of Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and IgE</title><p>LTB4, leukotriene, plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of asthma. LTB4 is a pro-adhesive chemo-attractor for lymphocytes present in the lungs via mastocytes, eosinophils, and alveolar macrophages. The levels of LTB4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-12-01206-f006">Figure 6</xref>A) in the plasma of asthma-induced mice increased (OVA, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001, 2591.34 &#x000b1; 61.01 pg/mL) when compared to the normal control group (NC 55.25 &#x000b1; 9.80 pg/mL). In the case of IgE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-12-01206-f006">Figure 6</xref>B), in the OVA inflammation-induced lung allergy group, the total IgE levels were significantly higher (850.0 &#x000b1; 48.3), whereas treatment with DEX, SO, TUR, and nano-emulsion showed a significant lowering of IgE.

Determination of Pro-Inflammatory and Anti-Inflammatory Cytokines</title><p>Several cytokines are associated with lung inflammation that are essentially derived from Th2 cells, viz. IL-4, IL-6, and IL-13 were analyzed. IL-10, a pleiotropic and potent anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive cytokine, was also analyzed to study the immunomodulatory potential of the product. IL-10 is produced by cells of both innate and adaptive immunity including dendritic cells, macrophages, mast cells, natural killer cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, as well as Th2 and Treg cells. The high levels of Th2 pro-inflammatory cytokines are strongly associated with increased airway inflammation in asthma. The nano-emulsion treatment showed a more potentiated anti-inflammatory effect than the corresponding vehicle (SO) and pristine TUR powder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-12-01206-f007">Figure 7</xref>). The OVA treatment stimulated the levels of IL-4, IL-6, and IL-13 concentrations in the BALF of the disease control group (OVA). Treatment with nano-emulsion suppressed the inflammation-activated immune system and helped to elevate the levels of the natural anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot7-pharmaceutics-12-01206"><title>3.7.

Discussion</title><p>Oxidative stress and associated inflammation in the lung and the circulation in response to exposure to air pollution, tobacco smoke, infection, or potentially toxic non-biodegradable nanoparticles are the leading pathogenic processes responsible for either acute or chronic lung injury [<xref rid="B16-pharmaceutics-12-01206" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Several dietary constituents contribute to antioxidant/oxidant and inflammatory status in lung injury. In general, the population has diets with lower fruit and vegetable intake; thus, the consumption of fewer antioxidants leads to more vulnerability to impaired lung function and the risk of having lung injuries [<xref rid="B17-pharmaceutics-12-01206" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. There is not a single healthy diet that can act as a magic bullet for pulmonary functioning. Indian, Chinese, Mediterranean, or Nepalese foods may have therapeutic values against certain diseases due to their abundance of antioxidants. Most of the activities associated with foods were related to the compounds present in the raw materials used for their preparation, such as spices like turmeric and other natural products [<xref rid="B18-pharmaceutics-12-01206" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Turmeric is a spice and is known as the main ingredient in most of the spicy curries in India and other parts of Asia, and has been extensively utilized for a long time in various diseases. Curcumin is the main bioactive component in turmeric that has powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects [<xref rid="B19-pharmaceutics-12-01206" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-pharmaceutics-12-01206" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-pharmaceutics-12-01206" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-pharmaceutics-12-01206" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The acute brain inflammation and its damage, leading to long-term memory loss caused by lipopolysaccharides, can be significantly reduced by treatment with turmeric in mice [<xref rid="B19-pharmaceutics-12-01206" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].

Curcumin nano-emulsion has been explored as a safe and effective formulation to prevent tumor reincidence and metastasis [<xref rid="B23-pharmaceutics-12-01206" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Curcuminoid extracts and nano-emulsion prepared from <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> inhibited the growth of lung cancer cells A549 and H460, thus proving the potential of curcumin nano-emulsion for lung delivery [<xref rid="B24-pharmaceutics-12-01206" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>In contrast to isolated phytoconstituents, the medicinal extract components often work synergistically to produce their therapeutic effects. However, innovative strategies are required to present these extracts in an acceptable and easily scalable approach without altering the functionality. Turmeric has poor bioavailability (around 1%), so it requires extremely high doses for it to have any appreciable effects [<xref rid="B18-pharmaceutics-12-01206" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The principal constituent of turmeric is curcuminoids, which exhibit antioxidant properties due to the inhibition of reactive oxygen species like hydrogen peroxide superoxide and nitric oxide radicals [<xref rid="B25-pharmaceutics-12-01206" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-pharmaceutics-12-01206" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Sesame oil is an edible oil that is frequently used as an adjuvant during food preparation in the Mediterranean, Indian, or Nepalese areas along with some parts of Asia. The oil contains mainly fatty acids (eicosanoic, linoleic, linolenic, oleic, palmitic, palmitoleic, and stearic acids), lignans, and antioxidants (&#x003b3;-tocopherol) [<xref rid="B27-pharmaceutics-12-01206" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-pharmaceutics-12-01206" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].

In this study, the potential protective activity of the nano-emulsion of dietary constituents on lung inflammation and edema was investigated by employing an experimental allergic asthma mouse model. Nano-emulsion was found to reduce pulmonary edema by inhibiting pulmonary inflammation in our animal model. Pulmonary edema may not be the primary characteristic of asthma; it may occur following acute aggravation of an asthmatic condition [<xref rid="B31-pharmaceutics-12-01206" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 and IL-6) are known to intensify the inflammatory cascade and to improve vascular penetrability, which can lead to the formation of pulmonary edema in allergic asthma [<xref rid="B32-pharmaceutics-12-01206" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-pharmaceutics-12-01206" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-pharmaceutics-12-01206" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>It is known that the inflammatory cascade plays a significant role in the development of chronic diseases. In this study, pro-inflammatory cytokine production was found to be substantially decreased by the nano-emulsion of turmeric extract. It reduced inflammation and pulmonary edema by inhibiting the infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. By inhibiting inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and enzymes, nano-emulsion decreased neutrophil invasion, with decreases in associated pulmonary edema, and inflammation [<xref rid="B35-pharmaceutics-12-01206" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. A protective effect from pulmonary edema in different models is indicative of Leucocyte infiltration [<xref rid="B36-pharmaceutics-12-01206" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-pharmaceutics-12-01206" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The pathways of MAPK, NF-kB, and IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, and TNF-&#x003b1; can also be minimized by treatment with curcumin [<xref rid="B38-pharmaceutics-12-01206" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-pharmaceutics-12-01206" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In BALF and neutrophil infiltration in the lung, treatment with nano-emulsion decreased cell counts. It has been supported with the flow cytometric data, where the nano-emulsion has reduced the elevated number of immune cells infiltrating the lung tissue (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-pharmaceutics-12-01206">Supplement Materials</xref>
<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-pharmaceutics-12-01206">Figures S1 and S2</xref>). The effect was observed on the B cells, neutrophils, and T<sub>H</sub> cells, which are major contributors for the formation of inflammatory mediators. The treatment of TUR and SO alone has not given significant results on the reduction in the percentage of immune cells in lungs. We suggest that sesame oil-extract of turmeric in nanoemulsified form can be used to prevent allergic pulmonary inflammation associated with asthma by inhibiting the infiltration of leukocytes, especially neutrophils.</p><p>The anti-inflammatory activities of curcuminoids in several studies have shown that curcumin was able to regulate receptor levels of Notch1/2 and GATA3 in acute allergic asthma caused by inflammation in BALB/c mice [<xref rid="B40-pharmaceutics-12-01206" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-pharmaceutics-12-01206" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Nano-emulsion has been shown to lower IgE levels in mice sensitized with OVA, and thus serves as a possible new treatment for allergic asthma. In allergic asthma pathogenesis, IgE plays a key role with systemic IgE levels directly proportional to chronic asthma, even though IgE had not been previously considered as a clinical biomarker [<xref rid="B42-pharmaceutics-12-01206" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Antibodies may control IgE, which displays a strong beneficial influence in allergic asthma in both animals and humans [<xref rid="B24-pharmaceutics-12-01206" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In addition, curcuminoids minimize the inflammation due to allergic reactions in the asthma animal model by controlling the Treg to Th17 equilibrium by increasing the Treg cell concentration [<xref rid="B43-pharmaceutics-12-01206" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>The developed nano-emulsion has potential beneficial biological effects in reversing the oxidative lung damage. Although the technology has promising therapeutic effects, quality consistency with respect to natural products is a concern and needs to be optimized for successful clinical translation. Acute toxicity studies as per OECD guidelines and dose optimization studies for effective tailoring of the dose for human application will help to move a step ahead in commercialization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-pharmaceutics-12-01206"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>All over the world, lung inflammation, either chronic or acute, is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are of choice for the rapid relief of inflammation and for arresting the further cascade of inflammatory reaction leading to tissue damage. However, numerous side effects associated with steroidal therapy necessitates new safe drug development. However, the low success rate of new drug discovery requires a paradigm shift for innovative drug development strategies, and thus getting inspiration from natural products for effective treatment of disease needs to be appreciated. The use of nanotechnology alters the physicochemical and biological properties of natural products, making them potent synthetic drugs. In the present study, the nanoemulsification process using routinely consumed food materials potentiated the immunoregulatory effect of turmeric extracted in sesame oil as observed from elevated levels of the natural anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10. Being well-established dietary constituents, the product is digestible, biodegradable, and safe. The dietary constituents-based nano-emulsion of spice turmeric helped in scavenging the free radicals in the injured lungs, thus modulating the inflammation pathway. This easily scalable and food constituents-based formulation technology can therefore serve as a potentially safe and noninvasive treatment modality for reducing lung inflammation in lung injury cases. The multipronged therapeutic approach proved as a platform technology can be easily adapted to other chronic inflammatory diseases too.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>R.R.A. and U.K. wanted to thank the Registrar, KLEF Deemed to be University, Guntur 522502, India for the providing necessary facilities for the smooth conduction of the project.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><app-group><app id="app1-pharmaceutics-12-01206"><title>Supplementary Materials</title><p>The following are available online at <uri xlink:href="https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/12/12/1206/s1">https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/12/12/1206/s1</uri>.
