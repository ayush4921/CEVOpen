It is well known that safflower is used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Furthermore, safflower is also an important oil crop grown in multiple countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The safflower seeds have a high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) with a high proportion of linoleic acid (LA). Linoleic acid is protective against various conditions such as cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases. It is also used as a precursor in the biosynthesis of arachidonic acid, prostaglandins, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukotrienes">leukotrienes</ext-link> and thromboxane, which have extensive medicinal and nutritional values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par70">Polyunsaturated fatty acids are important nutrients and cannot be synthesized in human body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. At present, improving the nutritional quality of safflower seeds is a vital objective for oil-utilized safflower breeding. The increased efficiency and decreased cost of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) makes thorough investigation of the metabolite mechanisms possible. In flaxseed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], peanut [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], olive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], oil palm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and soybean [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], the profiling of differentially expressed genes and the key genes involved in some metabolite variations have been identified using de novo transcriptome sequencing. For safflower, to date, complete genome information is not available, and most safflower researchers have concentrated on studies of the molecular mechanisms of the flowers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and different tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], including the flowers, leaves and roots involved in flavonoids compounds biosynthesis. Although a large number of target genes information exists in the abovementioned datasets that can be utilized, a systematic transcriptome analysis of the dynamic developmental progress of safflower seeds is still lacking. Thus, it is essential to explore the expression of RNA transcripts at the whole gene expression level in safflower seeds to further the study above the molecular mechanism of polyunsaturated fatty acids biosynthesis.</p><p id="Par71">In this study, the fatty acid compositions in the developing safflower seeds and several key stages concerning the accumulation of fatty acids were selected and used for the transcriptome analysis by Illumina sequencing technology. In total, 29,699 (length&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;500&#x02009;bp) and 15,817 (length&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;1000&#x02009;bp) unigenes were obtained from twelve transcriptomes of safflower seeds within four development stages. The assembly and annotation of the transcriptome data and gene expression profiles will lay a vital foundation for investigating the PUFA and TAG biosynthesis pathways.

According to the categories, the three compared groups showed similar patterns (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S3).</p><p id="Par84">The KEGG functional enrichment analysis was then performed to reveal their biological functions. Within contrast group 10 DAF vs. 14 DAF, the different unigenes were mainly enriched in ribosome (137 unigenes), plant hormone signal transduction (106), starch and sucrose metabolism (95), carbon metabolism (79), and biosynthesis of amino acids (74). In the contrast group 14 DAF vs. 18 DAF, the most represented KEGG pathways were ribosome (202), carbon metabolism (105), biosynthesis of amino acids (96), plant hormone signal transduction (94), and starch and sucrose metabolism (85). Within contrast group 18 DAF vs. 22 DAF, the most represented KEGG pathways were pI3K-Akt signalling pathway (39), phagosome (38), biosynthesis of amino acids (32), focal adhesion (31), and starch and sucrose metabolism (30) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S3). The above analyses revealed that the ribosome, biosynthesis of amino acids, starch and sucrose metabolism and carbon metabolism activity underwent enhancement with safflower seed development from 10 DAF to 18 DAF. In the contrast group 18 DAF vs. 22 DAF, the number of different unigenes enriched in ribosome, biosynthesis of amino acids and carbon metabolism pathway were significantly lower than the other contrast groups.</p><p id="Par85">These results indicated that safflower seeds have vigorous life activities between 10 DAF to 18 DAF, and then gradually enter a dormancy period after 18 DAF. In addition, it is necessary to mention the unigenes in the pathways responsible for seed oil biosynthesis. Fatty acid metabolism activity was mainly enriched from 10 DAF to 18 DAF, and the number of different unigenes decreased in the contrast group 18 DAF vs. 22 DAF. For LA metabolism, the largest number of different unigenes emerged in the contrast group 14 DAF vs. 18 DAF (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S4). These findings were consistent with the results that the contents of total fatty acids and LA sharply increased from 14 DAF to 18 DAF in safflower seed.

These genes had one or more isoform, and their expression levels were higher at 10 DAF or 14 DAF, and lower at 18 DAF or 22 DAF, suggesting that they were mainly responsible for the beginning of FA biosynthesis during the early safflower seed developmental stages (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S4). The first reaction is catalysed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase), and it generates malonyl-CoA. ACCase is a rate-limiting enzyme which controls the rate of fatty acid synthesis; subsequently, repeated condensations of malonyl-ACP with the growing acyl-ACP chain are derived by FAs synthase, continuously adding two carbon units until forming 16:0-ACP. The newly synthesized FAs are mainly exported to the ER as acyl-CoA and join the glycerolipid synthesis pathway in oilseeds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).

The same extracted RNA samples from the seeds at the four developmental phases were used as templates for RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR.

Because of the high value and importance of LA, its exploitation and utilization and investigations into the mechanisms of oil and PUFA biosynthesis have been extensively reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. In recent years, safflower has been grown widely as a kind of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in China and as an ancient oilseed crop because of its high-quality esculent oil. Safflower oil is a critical nutritional supplement for specific populations, such as weanling infants and pregnant women.</p><p id="Par101">The investigations of the molecular mechanisms involved in lipid metabolism are critical for genetic engineering of safflower to increase its oil accumulation level or to change the oil composition. In this research, transcriptome analysis was performed to reveal the temporal changes in FA biosynthesis during the seed developmental process. The temporal gene expression profiles were detected across three seed developmental stages, 10&#x02013;14, 14&#x02013;18, and 18&#x02013;22 DAF. Our results showed that FA biosynthesis is a dominant cellular process during the first stage and the fatty acids desaturation mainly occurs at the first and second stages (oleate desaturation mainly in the second stage), and these results were in accordance with the changes of fatty acid contents across safflower seed development.</p><p id="Par102">High levels of the transcripts of the ACCase gene and fatty acid synthase gene (FAS) at 10&#x02013;14 DAF were detected. ACCase can catalyse the conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, which is an irreversible but important reaction for the initiation of FA biosynthesis; ACCase is also thought to be a key enzyme that controls the rate of FA biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p id="Par103">For the fatty acid desaturation, significant expression changes of two genes, stearoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] 9-desaturase gene (<italic>SAD</italic>) from 10 to 14 DAF and oleate desaturase gene (<italic>FAD2&#x02013;1</italic>) from 14 to 18 DAF, were observed by transcriptomic analyses, indicating that <italic>SAD</italic> and <italic>FAD2&#x02013;1</italic> might be important for the synthesis of USFAs. Stearoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] 9-desaturase is a key enzyme that can convert steroid-ACP to oleate-ACP, and oleate desaturase (FAD2&#x02013;1) is also a key enzyme that can catalyse the conversion of monounsaturated fatty acids to diunsaturated fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In addition, only one isoform of the ER-located FAD3 enzyme was found, and its expression level was extremely low at 10&#x02013;22 DAF, which was the primary reason for no detected ALA in mature safflower seeds. For TAG assembly, the <italic>DGAT</italic> genes were mainly expressed at 18 DAF, suggesting the progression of TAG assembly primarily occurred at the third stage (18&#x02013;22 DAF). That result further revealed that in safflower, the FAs produced (the first stage) were not immediately available for TAG biosynthesis (the third stage) before desaturation (the second stage).</p><p id="Par104">Many well-known genes involved in lipid metabolism were identified as <italic>ACCase</italic>, <italic>FAS</italic>, <italic>DGAT</italic>, <italic>LACS</italic> and others. Genes in a cluster with similar temporal expression patterns might have similar functions in the same cellular process, and thus except for the known genes, some of the remaining unknown genes in cluster 1 and 3 might also contribute to lipid biosynthesis or regulate the biosynthesis pathway. Our investigation provides vital clues for further exploring the potential roles of these genes in the fatty acid biosynthesis process. In addition, many potential novel candidate regulatory factors were also revealed, including some known TFs (<italic>WRI1</italic>, <italic>LEC1</italic>, and <italic>ABI3</italic>) that were all up-regulated in the first stage (10&#x02013;14 DAF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Except for the known TFs, additional works are required to enlarge the pool of TFs for safflower in future researches. The above-mentioned candidate TFs might play important roles in lipid metabolism (FAs biosynthesis, FAs metabolism, FAs elongation and others).</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par105">In this study, to provide comprehensive insights about the molecular basis of oil accumulation, the morphological characters, and the FA compositions and contents, we performed whole gene expression scanning in developing safflower seeds. An increased expression level of genes involved in most FAs biosynthesis showed a positive correlation with an early increase in seed oil content at the embryogenesis phase. During the early seed developmental process, the cells differentiated and expanded rapidly, and abundant membrane lipids were synthesized in large quantities. The genes involved in most FAs biosynthesis that were highly expressed during the early seed developmental progress were mainly responsible for the biosynthesis of membrane lipids in safflower seeds. Subsequently, for genes involved in FAs biosynthesis, a coordinated down-regulation appeared until the desiccation phase, while the genes involved in TAG biosynthesis were activated during the seed-filling phase until they achieved the maximum lipid storage in the seeds. Our research will provide a possible correlation between the transcriptional profile of some lipid-metabolism-related genes and the dynamic accumulation pattern of seed oil in safflower. Meanwhile, this study also contributes key clues for further illumination of the regulatory mechanism of oil accumulation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec15"><title>Plant material</title><p id="Par106">Seeds of the safflower cultivar (Chuan Hong No1) were collected in 2017 from the Wenjiang experimental field (black loam, sown in September and harvested in May, the permission to collect plant samples has been obtained), College of Agronomy, Sichuan Agriculture University, China, It had been grown under the same growing conditions for a continuous five years.
