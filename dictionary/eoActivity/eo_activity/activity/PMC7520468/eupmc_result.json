    "In Jordan, Salvia ceratophylla L. is traditionally used in the treatment of cancer, microbial infections, and urinary disorders. This study aimed: (1) to chemically characterize S. ceratophylla essential oil (EO) from South Jordan, by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS); and (2) to evaluate in vitro the cytotoxic, anti-inflammatory, and antiprotozoal activities of the EO, it's predominant components, and the hexane (A), ethyl acetate (B), methanol (C) and crude-methanol extracts (D). The analysis revealed that the EO has 71 compounds, with linalool (54.8%) as main constituent. Only the hexane extract (A) showed some cytotoxic activity against SK-MEL, KB, BT-549, SK-OV-3, LLC-PK1 and VERO cells lines with IC<sub>50</sub> between 60 and > 100 µg/mL. The EO inhibited NO production (IC<sub>50</sub> 90 µg/mL) and NF-κB activity (IC<sub>50</sub> 38 µg/mL). The extracts A, B, and D inhibited NO production and NF- κB activity with IC<sub>50</sub> between 32 and 150 µg/mL. Linalool considerably inhibited NO production (IC<sub>50</sub> 18 µg/mL). The extracts tested did not exhibit antileishmanial activity. Regarding antitrypanosomal activity, the EO exhibited significant results with IC<sub>50</sub> 2.65 µg/mL. In conclusion, Jordan S. ceratophylla EO represents a rich source of linalool and bears a promising therapeutic potential for further antitrypanosomal drug development."
