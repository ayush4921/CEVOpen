    "<i>Salvia reuterana</i> Boiss. is an aromatic perennial plant traditionally used for its anxiolytic and sedative properties. In the present study, various fractions and essential oil of <i>S. reuterana</i> aerial parts were investigated to find its free radical scavenging principles. Hydroalcoholic fraction with IC<sub>50</sub> value of 112.6 ±3.2 μg mL<sup>-1</sup> in DPPH assay demonstrated the highest free radical scavenging activity and was selected to further phytochemical investigation. RP-18 and Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography of the hydroalcoholic fraction resulted in the isolation and structural elucidation of four phenolic derivatives, including apigenin-7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (<b>1</b>), luteolin-7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (<b>2</b>), rosmarinic acid (<b>3</b>), and luteolin (<b>4</b>). Isolated compounds showed potent free radical scavenging activities (5.1-34.2 μg mL<sup>-1</sup>), compared with BHT (21.30 ± 1.9 μg mL<sup>-1</sup>). Twenty four compounds were also identified in GC-MS analysis of the plant essential oil, of which benzyl benzoate (26.64%), <i>n</i>-hexyl benzoate (22.99%) and <i>n</i>-hexyl isovalerate (6.04%) were the main compounds. The results of the present study introduced <i>S. reuterana</i> as a valuable source of natural phenolic antioxidants which can be utilized in prevention of oxidative stress related diseases. Moreover, interesting composition of <i>S. reuterana</i> essential oil, dominated by non-terpenes compounds (76.17%) especially aromatic derivatives, make it an appropriate candidate for more detailed studies."
