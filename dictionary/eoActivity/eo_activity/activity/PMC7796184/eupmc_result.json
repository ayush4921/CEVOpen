    "<i>Pulicaria jaubertii</i> is a medicinal herb that alleviates inflammations and fever. Chromatographic separation, phytochemical characterization, and in vitro biological activities of the plant <i>n</i>-hexane extract were conducted for the first time in this study. Six compounds were isolated for the first time from the <i>n</i>-hexane fraction of <i>Pulicaria jaubertii</i> aerial parts and were identified on the bases of NMR and MS analyses as pseudo-taraxaterol (<b>1</b>), pseudo-taraxasterol acetate (<b>2</b>), 3β-acetoxytaraxaster-20-en-30-aldehyde (<b>3</b>), calenduladiol-3-<i>O</i>-palmitate (<b>4</b>), stigmasterol (<b>5</b>), and α-tocospiro B (<b>6</b>). Compound (<b>6</b>) was a rare tocopherol-related compound and was isolated for the first time from family Asteraceae, while compound (<b>3</b>) was isolated for the first time from genus <i>Pulicaria</i>. The total alcoholic extract and <i>n</i>-hexane fraction were tested for their anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, and cytotoxic activities. The <i>n</i>-hexane fraction has dose dependent red blood cells (RBCs) membrane stabilization and inhibition of histamine release activities with IC<sub>50</sub>: 60.8 and 72.9 µg/mL, respectively. As antidiabetic activity, the alcoholic extract exerted the most inhibition on the activity of yeast α-glucosidase, with an IC<sub>50</sub>: 76.8 µg/mL. The <i>n</i>-hexane fraction showed cytotoxic activity against hepatocarcinoma (HepG-2), breast carcinoma (MCF-7), and prostate carcinoma (PC-3) cell lines with IC<sub>50</sub>: 51.8, 90.8 and 62.2 µg/mL, respectively. In conclusion, the anti-inflammatory effect of <i>Pulicaria jaubertii</i> might be attributed to the triterpenoid constituents of the <i>n</i>-hexane extract of the plant."
