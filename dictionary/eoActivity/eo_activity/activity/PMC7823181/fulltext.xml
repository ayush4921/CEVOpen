We aimed to investigate analgesic, anti-inflammatory and anti-ulcer activities of PFO and PFO-supplemented soybean milk (PFO-SM) in animal models. Analgesic activity was assessed in acetic acid-induced writhing in mice, while anti-inflammatory activity was performed in ethyl phenylpropiolate (EPP)-induced ear edema and carrageenan-induced hind paw edema in rats. Anti-ulcer effects were conducted in water immersion stress, HCl/ethanol and indomethacin-induced gastric ulcer in rats. Distinctly, PFO, containing 6.96 mg ALA and 2.61 mg LA equivalence/g, did not induce acute toxicity (LD<sub>50</sub> &#x0003e; 10 mL/kg) in mice. PFO (2.5 and 5 mL/kg) and PFO-SM (0.05 mL PFO equivalence/kg) inhibited incidences of writhing (16.8, 18.0 and 32.3%, respectively) in acetic acid-induced mice. In addition, topical applications of PFO (0.1 and 1 mL/ear) significantly inhibited EPP-induced ear edema (59.3 and 65.7%, respectively) in rats, while PFO-SM slightly inhibited ear edema (25.9%). However, PFO and PFO-SM did not inhibit carrageenan-induced hind paw edema in rats. Indeed, PFO (2.5 and 5 mL/kg) significantly inhibited gastric ulcers in rats that induced by water immersion stress (92.4 and 96.6%, respectively), HCl/ethanol (74.8 and 73.3%, respectively) and indomethacin (68.8 and 88.9%, respectively), while PFO-SM did not. PFO displayed potent analgesic, anti-inflammatory and anti-ulcer properties, while PFO-SM exerted only analgesic properties. Thus, Thai PFO and its functional drink offer potential benefits in treatment of analgesic, inflammatory diseases and gastric ulcer.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>analgesic</kwd><kwd>anti-inflammatory</kwd><kwd>anti-ulcer</kwd><kwd>fruit oil</kwd><kwd>Perilla frutescence</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Inflammation, which can be caused by physical and chemical trauma, drugs and infectious microorganisms, is a defense mechanism of the body that serves to eliminate damaged tissue or invading pathogens [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Commonly, related responses are characterized by localized redness, heat, swelling, pain and a loss of tissue function. During these responses, vascular permeability is increased to recruit inflammatory cells to the injury sites, which can cause leakage of plasma fluid and subsequent edema. In addition, released inflammatory mediators, such as histamine and prostaglandins (PGs), can promote the occurrence of pain. Finally, edema and pain can cause a loss of tissue function. However, uncontrolled inflammation contributes to a variety of inflammatory diseases including cardiovascular disease, diabetes and gastric ulcers [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Currently, gastric ulcers have become a serious health problem throughout the world. Gastric ulcers occur in the mucosa of stomach as a result of inflammation and oxidative stress [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Normally, mucus and bicarbonates that serve as a protective layer, are secreted by mucosal cells to neutralize hydrochloric acid (HCl); nonetheless, this layer can be broken down by the actions of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> and ethanol [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;8</xref>]. Moreover, an increase in stomach acid secretions also promotes gastric ulcers that can be caused by stress, smoking and the consumption of spicy foods [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Deep ulcers can damage underlying blood vessels leading to bleeding and hemorrhaging in the gastrointestinal tract [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Thus, treatment of gastric ulcers should focus on the restoration of this protective layer and decrease the presence of gastric acid in order to minimize tissue damage.</p><p><italic>Perilla frutescens</italic> (L.) Britton are grown in Northern provinces of Thailand including Chiang Mai, Maehongsorn and Nan (Thai local name &#x02018;nga&#x02010;keemon&#x02019;). Perilla fruits have been widely used in both traditional and medicinal foods. Perilla fruit oil (PFO) has been used as Northern food additive and herb in folk medicine for a long time. Nowadays, PFO is formulated in dessert, capsule gel, functional drink and soap for commercial purposes. Interestingly, the fruits contain approximately 35&#x02013;45% oil that is rich in &#x003c9;3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (&#x003c9;3-PUFA), particularly &#x003b1;-linolenic acid (ALA) (54&#x02013;65% of total fatty acids) [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;11</xref>]. In addition, &#x003c9;6-PUFA, namely linoleic acid (LA), and &#x003c9;9 PUFA, namely oleic acid (OA), have been detected in PFO [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Likewise, PFO contains certain other lipids including glycolipids, phospholipids, sterols and tocopherols [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Evidences from animal studies suggest that PFO possesses anti-asthmatic and neuroprotective effects [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Indeed, PFO modulated lipid parameters and pro-inflammatory cytokines, potentially lowering incidences of cardiovascular disease and inflammatory disease [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;17</xref>]. We have recently demonstrated that Thai PFO showed hepatoprotective effects against carbon tetrachloride (CCl<sub>4</sub>)-induced liver inflammation in rats [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>The dietary beverage, soybean milk (SM), is a popular traditional drink that is rich in protein, essential amino acids, isoflavones (e.g. daidzein, glycitein, genistein, daidzin, glycitin and genistin) and lecithin [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. SM has been found to exert analgesic, anti-inflammatory and cardiovascular effects [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21&#x02013;23</xref>]. Therefore, a combination of PFO and SM would promote a range of nutritional and pharmacological effects on human health. Many previous studies have demonstrated the biological activities of PFO; nonetheless, only a few studies have been published on the analgesic, anti-inflammatory and anti-ulcer effects of PFO and PFO-supplemented SM (PFO-SM). In the present study, PFO and PFO-SM were evaluated in terms of its analgesic, anti-inflammatory and anti-ulcer activities in animals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Chemicals and reagents</title><p>All organic solvents (the highest pure grade) were purchased from Fisher Scientific Company (Hampton, NH, U.S.A.).

HPLC analysis of PFO revealed two predominant essential PUFAs including ALA (&#x003c9;3-PUFA) and LA (&#x003c9;6-PUFA). In accordance, ALA and LA exist not only in Thai PFO, but also in Korean PFO [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. It has been well documented that consumption of oil with a high ratio of &#x003c9;6-PUFA:&#x003c9;3-PUFA is associated with a high risk of chronic inflammatory diseases [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In the present study, the Thai PFO had a low ratio (0.38) of &#x003c9;6-PUFA:&#x003c9;3-PUFA, while other PFO had a ratio of 0.25 [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Remarkably, this ratio difference may possibly be due to a variety of cultivars and environmental factors that are present during the cultivation process, such as temperature, light and existing ground minerals. In addition, we have previously demonstrated that Thai PFO was abundant with vitamin E including &#x003b2;-tocopherol (49.50 mg/kg), &#x003b1;-tocopherol (25.05 mg/kg) and &#x003b3;-tocotrienol (43.65 mg/kg) [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. With regard to consumer safety, we found that Thai PFO did not cause acute toxicity in mice in which the LD<sub>50</sub> value was greater than 10 mL/kg. This result is in agreement with previous study found that perilla oil at doses of up to 50 mL/kg did not induce toxicity in mice [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Taken together, these findings imply that Thai PFO, which rich in ALA, LA and vitamin E (mainly &#x003b2;-tocopherol, &#x003b1;-tocopherol and &#x003b3;-tocotrienol), is beneficial and safe for nutritious and pharmacological purposes.</p><p>Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience; however, it is an important defense mechanism that serves to warn the body about the presence of actual injury or disease. It can also persist and can consequently affect one&#x02019;s daily activities as well as individual&#x02019;s quality of life. Consequently, analgesics are often prescribed to prevent or minimize pain. An acetic acid-induced writhing model is commonly used to evaluate analgesic activity in animals, as writhing is a responsive indicator of pain that is induced by certain irritants such as acetic acid. Normally, acetic acid can damage tissues and induce the release of inflammatory mediators such as histamine, bradykinin and PGs. These mediators essentially stimulate nociceptors (known as pain-sensing nerve cells), which will further transmit signals to the spinal cord and brain in response to pain. ASA or aspirin, which is a well-known analgesic and NSAID drug, can irreversibly and non-selectively inhibit the activity of cyclooxygenases (COXs) that catalyze the conversion of arachidonic acid (AA) into powerful inflammatory mediators, especially PGs [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Herein, the administration of ASA (150 mg/kg) potently inhibited writhing by up to 80%, while PFO and PFO-SM weakly inhibited writhing suggesting that the bioactive compounds present in PFO and PFO-SM could inhibit the production of inflammatory mediators and lead to an analgesic effect. Presumably, ALA, LA and vitamin E may modulate the production of inflammatory mediators and respond to the analgesic activity of PFO and PFO-SM. In cells, the conversions of ALA into eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) or LA to AA, are catalyzed by serial &#x00394;-6-desaturase, elongase and &#x00394;-5-desaturase enzymes, of which the latter products are known to be further converted into PGs by COX [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, the 3-series PGs which derived from EPA, exert fewer pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory properties than the 2-series PGs which derived from AA [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Indeed, EPA could act as a competitive inhibitor of AA to inhibit the activity of COX leading to a decrease in PGE<sub>2</sub> production, but also results in an increase in PGE<sub>3</sub> synthesis [<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. A previous study has claimed that the intake of fish oil rich in ALA, EPA and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) could prevent colon cancer in rats through inhibition of the synthesis of pro-inflammatory mediators, especially PGE<sub>2</sub> [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In addition to essential fatty acids, vitamin E also displayed an anti-inflammatory property through the inhibition of PGE<sub>2</sub> [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Apparently, the findings indicate that PFO and PFO-SM display analgesic effects in acetic acid-induced writhing in mice.</p><p>In addition to the analgesic activity, we also evaluated the anti-inflammatory activity of PFO and PFO-SM using EPP-induced ear edema and carrageenan-induced hind paw edema in rats. EPP and carrageenan are widely used to induce acute inflammation in rats. Topical applications of EPP to the irritated skin of the ears of rats further induced the release of various kinds of inflammatory mediators including histamine, bradykinin and PGs. All of these mediators increased vascular permeability, plasma leakage and incidences of edema. They also promoted the infiltration of leukocytes to the site of the injury, especially monocytes and neutrophils, which can subsequently generate pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to the amplification of an inflammation response. In the present research work, both PBZ and PFO significantly suppressed EPP-induced ear edema. PBZ is an NSAID that is known to inactivate COX and inhibit the synthesis of PGs. It is likely that PFO, containing ALA and vitamin E, may effectively inhibit ear edema by reducing the levels of PGs and pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as by scavenging ROS. This hypothesis is supported by the findings of previous reports which found that perilla oil suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines including the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1;, interleukin (IL)-1&#x003b2; and IL-6 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of ovalbumin-challenged mice [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. One study reported that a high intake of ALA reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-6 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of hypercholesterolemic subjects [<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Additionally, several studies have found that vitamin E not only exerted strong anti-oxidant activity, but also displayed anti-inflammatory properties through the inhibition of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43&#x02013;45</xref>]. As mentioned above, data are in good agreement with regard to the anti-inflammatory effects of chemically detected PFO that have been identified in the present study. In comparison with PFO, PFO-SM, that contained 100-fold less the amount of PFO, only slightly inhibited ear edema in the first 15 min after the topical application of EPP. Furthermore, we also evaluated the effects of PFO on carrageenan-induced hind paw edema in rats. Carrageenan is a mucopolysaccharide that is extracted from <italic>Chondrus crispus</italic>, which can then induce the release of histamine, bradykinin and PGs, resulting in increases in vascular permeability and inflammatory cell infiltration. In our experiment, pretreatment with aspirin significantly inhibited carrageenan-induced hind paw edema in rats. Unfortunately, both PFO and PFO-SM had no effect on paw edema in rats. It is likely that PFO would need time to be absorbed and metabolized before being transported to various types of cells for a range of purposes. The findings suggest that PFO displays anti-inflammatory activities in EPP-induced ear edema but had no effect on carrageenan-induced hind paw edema in rats.</p><p>Furthermore, we investigated the gastroprotective effects of PFO and PFO-SM on water immersion stress-induced gastric ulcers, HCl/ethanol-induced gastric ulcers and indomethacin-induced gastric ulcers in rats. In the present study, we used different kinds of ulcer inducers to promote gastric injuries including those that were induced by stress, alcohol and NSAIDs like indomethacin [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref>]. Alcohol and indomethacin are known to destroy gastric mucosa, while stress promotes the secretion of stomach acid, which can result in tissue injuries [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These gastric injuries involve inflammation and oxidative stress through the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as ROS. The current study has shown that cimetidine and PFO effectively protected against gastric ulcers induced by water immersion stress, HCl/ethanol and indomethacin in rats. As a positive drug, cimetidine is a well-known gastric acid reducer that has been used to treat gastric ulcers. In our findings, active compounds detected in PFO exert anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities, leading to the prevention of gastric ulcers. Indeed, previous evidence supports the claim that the anti-inflammatory activity of PUFAs, like ALA and LA, are directly associated with the number of double bonds that are present in their structures [<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. ALA, LA and DHA suppressed both IL-8 mRNA and protein expression in <italic>H. pylori</italic>-infected gastric epithelial cells, whereas DHA displayed the greatest degree of suppression of IL-8 production followed by ALA and LA, respectively [<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. It has been reported that perilla oil as well as ALA displayed protective effects against hydrogen peroxide-induced neuronal oxidative stress and apoptosis in human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells [<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Vitamin E also protected against gastric mucosa injury by scavenging ROS and lowering lipid peroxidation in ethanol-induced gastric ulcers in rats [<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Indeed, PFO effectively ameliorated gastric ulcers in rats induced by water immersion stress, HCl/ethanol and indomethacin through anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities.</p><p>Importantly, it has been reported that a high intake of ALA is associated with lower production of inflammatory mediators and cytokines. These inflammatory mediators and cytokines are involved in the amplification of inflammatory responses [<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. ALA, which is a major PUFA in PFO, has been known to be enzymatically converted into 3&#x003c9;-PUFA, such as EPA and DHA, in the body. In addition, these enzymes share their functions in metabolizing LA to AA, which will then be further converted into inflammatory mediators (eicosanoids). Thus, a high intake of ALA could reduce the production of inflammatory mediators derived from AA and consequently inhibit inflammation. Interestingly, DHA was found to inactivate nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing protein-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome which is assembled in response to infection or danger signals and subsequently activates the maturation and release of many pro-inflammatory cytokines [<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. With regard to the anti-inflammatory property of PFO, ALA and its metabolites (EPA and DHA) transduce a signal through a G-protein-coupled receptor 120 and then activate their downstream scaffold protein &#x003b2;-arrestin-2. &#x003b2;-arrestin-2 subsequently binds to NLRP3 inflammasomes, resulting in inactivation of NLRP3 inflammasome, caspase-1 and inflammatory cytokines production. Furthermore, 3&#x003c9;-PUFA has been reported to suppress the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B, which is a priming step of inflammasome activation and leads to the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines [<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present study demonstrates that Thai PFO, containing ALA and LA, did not cause acute toxicity in mice. Pretreatment with PFO and PFO-SM inhibited acetic acid-induced writhing in mice, in which the PFO-SM was more potently analgesic than the PFO. Importantly, PFO effectively suppressed EPP-induced ear edema and prevented gastric ulcers induced by water immersion stress, HCl/ethanol and indomethacin in rats. Taken together, the findings from this present study reveal the analgesic effect of PFO and PFO-SM, as well as the anti-inflammatory and anti-ulcer activities of PFO. Furthermore, PFO and PFO-SM should be urgently investigated for their potent analgesic, anti-inflammatory and anti-ulcer effects in humans.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack1"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We express our appreciation to the Animal Study Ethical Committee for approval of the study protocol.
