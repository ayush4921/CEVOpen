    "<i>Abelmoschus moschatus</i> Medik. (family: Malvaceae) has a long history of being used as a folk medicine in Sri Lanka. Despite the therapeutic use of this plant in traditional medicine, leaves of <i>A. moschatus</i> have not been subjected to scientific evaluation of toxicity/adverse effects <i>in vivo</i>. Thus, the present study was aimed to assess the acute and 28-day repeated-dose oral toxic effects of hexane (55 mg/kg), ethyl acetate (75 mg/kg), butanol (60 mg/kg), and aqueous (140 mg/kg) leaf extracts of <i>A. moschatus</i> in Wistar rats. Furthermore, identification of phytochemical constituents and determination of <i>in vitro</i> total antioxidant activity of the selected leaf extracts of <i>A. moschatus</i> were carried out. Repeated-dose oral administration of hexane and aqueous plant extracts produced no significant changes in the hematological profile and in selected biochemical parameters compared to the untreated healthy rats (<i>p</i> > 0.05). The administration of ethyl acetate and butanol extracts resulted in significant changes in some of the hematological parameters (<i>p</i> < 0.05), whereas biochemical parameters were not changed (<i>p</i> > 0.05). No significant changes in the relative organ weight of treated rats were observed (<i>p</i> > 0.05) except in the kidneys of Wistar rats treated with the ethyl acetate extract of <i>A. moschatus</i> (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Normal morphology with no signs of hemorrhages, necrosis, or inflammatory cell infiltrations was observed in the vital organs selected during the assessment of histopathology on H and E-stained tissue sections upon the treatment of selected extracts. Alkaloids were absent in the selected leaf extracts excluding the health risk for harmful alkaloids. The highest total antioxidant activity was reported in the butanol extract. In conclusion, the hexane and aqueous extracts of <i>A. moschatus</i> were completely nontoxic, whereas butanol and ethyl acetate extracts showed statistically significant changes in some hematological parameters and in relative organ weight of kidneys in healthy Wistar rats."
