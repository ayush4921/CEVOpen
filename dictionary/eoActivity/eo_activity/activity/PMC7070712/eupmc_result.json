    "The discovery of several revitalizing molecules that can stop or reduce the pathology of a wide range of diseases will be considered a major breakthrough of the present time. Available synthetic compounds may provoke side effects and health issues, which heightens the need for molecules from plants and other natural resources under discovery as potential methods of replacing synthetic compounds. In traditional medicinal therapies, several plant extracts and phytochemicals have been reported to impart remedial effects as better alternatives. Murraya koenigii (M. koenigii) belongs to the Rutaceae family, which is commonly used as a medicinally important herb of Indian origin in the Ayurvedic system of medicine. Previous reports have demonstrated that the leaves, roots, and bark of this plant are rich sources of carbazole alkaloids, which produce potent biological activities and pharmacological effects. These include antioxidant, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, and neuroprotective activities. The present review provides insight into the major components of M. koenigii and their pharmacological activities against different pathological conditions. The review also emphasizes the need for more research on the molecular basis of such activity in various cellular and animal models to validate the efficacy of M. koenigii and its derivatives as potent therapeutic agents."
