    "Herbal and home remedies are widely used worldwide especially those for weight loss. The prevalence of overweight and obesity in Saudi Arabia has highly elevated during the past decades. People in Saudi Arabia preferred the usage of remedies more than standard medicine. Therefore, we conducted this study to assess the use of weight reduction herbal and home remedies in Tabuk, North West Saudi Arabia. Data about weight-loss herbal remedies were collected from major local herbalist shops. In addition, inherited weight-loss herbal and household remedies were collected. Data collected included composition, method of preparation, method of use, and any reported side effects. Some of these remedies were used either alone or in combination. Majority of these ingredients were boiled in water to be drunk or directly added to food. Most of these mixtures were taken before food to reduce appetite. Most of these herbs were recorded to produce side effects. Mainly people suffer from gastric symptoms and headache. Many natural herbal and home remedies are still in use in Tabuk for weight reduction. Many of these remedies lackÂ important scientific evidence for their usage, effectiveness, or safety."
