    "Immune response of a human body to the uncertain factors leads to the accelerated inflammatory proliferation of the ailing cells of the skin known as Psoriasis. Although the condition found described many decades ago, the etiology and treatment look under-researched. In Ayurveda, many herbs have proven efficacy in psoriasis, but the multifaceted etiology of the disease needs a multimodal treatment approach. We report about Ayurveda treatment in a 68-year-old female patient with plaque psoriasis presented with erythematous plaques on the anterior surface of the legs, right forehand, and neck region. The Auspitz sign and Koebner phenomenon were positive. The treatment protocol was adopted as per Ayurvedic samprapti (pathophysiology) and the patient cured completely without reporting any adverse events after the one year of treatment. No recurrence observed even after one year of the halted treatment. The importance of a wholesome diet as a health promoter is also revalidated. Photographic documentation was recorded with the proper consent of the patient during successive treatment and regular follow-ups. Altogether, multimodal Ayurveda treatment led to speedy and substantial recovery from a chronic case of psoriasis."
