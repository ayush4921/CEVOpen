    "<h4>Background</h4><i>Acorus tatarinowii</i> Schott [Shi Chang Pu in Chinese (SCP)] is a traditional Chinese medicine frequently used in the clinical treatment of dementia, amnesia, epilepsy, and other mental disorders. Previous studies have shown the potential efficacy of SCP against Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nevertheless, the active constituents and the modes of action of SCP in AD treatment have not been fully elucidated.<h4>Purpose</h4>The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of SCP on abnormal proteins and clarify its molecular mechanisms in the treatment of AD by using a <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> (<i>C. elegans</i>) model.<h4>Methods</h4>This study experimentally assessed the effect of SCP-Oil in CL4176 strains expressing human <i>Aβ</i> in muscle cells and CL2355 strains expressing human <i>Aβ</i> in <i>pan</i>-neurons. Western blotting, qRT-PCR, and fluorescence detection were performed to determine the oxidative stress and signaling pathways affected by SCP-Oil in nematodes.<h4>Results</h4>SCP-Oil could significantly reduce the deposition of misfolded <i>Aβ</i> and polyQ proteins and improved serotonin sensitivity and olfactory learning skill in worms. The analysis of pharmacological action mechanism of SCP-Oil showed that its maintaining protein homeostasis is dependent on the autophagy pathway regulated partly by <i>hsf-1</i> and <i>sir-2.1</i> genes.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our results provide new insights to develop treatment strategy for AD by targeting autophagy, and SCP-Oil could be an alternative drug for anti-AD."
