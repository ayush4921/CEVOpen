    "In this study, we focused on the neuro-behavioral profile, toxicity, and possible mechanisms of action of <i>Dorema ammoniacum</i> gum essential oil (DAG-EO). For this purpose, passive avoidance and Y-maze tests were performed to evaluate the potential effect of DAG-EO in the attenuation of memory impairment induced by 49 days administration of D-galactose and acute injection of scopolamine. Anticonvulsant and anti-nociceptive activities of DAG-EO were evaluated in the pentylenetetrazole and ‎maximal electroshock-induced models of seizure and acetic acid-induced writhing tests, respectively. To find the possible mechanism of action, flumazenil and naloxone were used. Furthermore, the possible side effects were determined in the open field, grip strength, and ‎rotarod tests. Our findings supported that 7-day administration of DAG-EO (50 and 100 mg/kg) improves memory impairment induced following administration of D-galactose and scopolamine. It was also revealed that DAG-EO possesses a dose-dependent sedative-hypnotic (100 mg/kg), anticonvulsant (ED<sub>50</sub> ≈ 170 mg/kg), and anti-nociceptive (ED<sub>50</sub> ≈ 175 mg/kg) activities possibly mediated via directly and/or indirectly modulation of GABA<sub>A</sub> and opioid receptors. No side effect was observed except muscle relaxation which was less than that of diazepam. The output of this study confirms anti-seizure, anti-nociceptive, sedative-hypnotic, and memory-enhancing properties of DAG-EO by modulation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors."
