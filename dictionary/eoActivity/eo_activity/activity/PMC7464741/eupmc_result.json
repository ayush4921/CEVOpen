    "Schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease caused by trematodes of the genus <i>Schistosoma</i>, is the second most prevalent parasitic disease in the world. It affects around 200 million people. Clinical treatment, prophylaxis, and prevention are performed in countries susceptible to schistosomiasis. In the pharmacological treatment for an acute form of schistosomiasis, the use of antiparasitics, mainly praziquantel, is more common. As an alternative way, prevention methods such as reducing the population of intermediate hosts (mollusks) with molluscicides are important in the control of this disease by interrupting the biological cycle of this etiological parasite. Despite the importance of pharmacological agents and molluscicides, they have side effects and environmental toxicity. In addition, they can lead to the development of resistance enhancing of parasites, and lead to the search for new and effective drugs, including resources of vegetal origin, which in turn, are abundant in the affected countries. Thus, the purpose of this review is to summarize recent studies on botanical products with potential for the control of schistosomiasis, including anti-Schistosoma and molluscicide activities. In addition, species and plant derivatives according to their origin or geographical importance indicating a possible utility of local resources for countries most affected by the disease are presented."
