    "Infection by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causing the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), is currently a global pandemic with more than two million deaths to date. Though a number of vaccines have recently been approved against the virus, availability remains a big challenge, and also acceptance by most people has become a big debate. This review discusses possible/proposed natural product remedies and some major conventional treatment options used to manage the infection and, safety concerns on the use of unproven or unapproved health products against COVID-19. An extensive literature review indicated that the influx of unproven and unapproved health products in the global market are on the rise, leading to various forms of self- medication. To this effect, there have been warnings by the United States Food and Drug Administration and the World Health Organisation against the use of such products. Conventional drugs such as remdesivir, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and dexamethasone are the major proposed drugs that are currently undergoing clinical trials for the management of this disease. Efforts are being made globally in the search for possible therapeutics which may be the best way to eradicating this disease. Some countries have approved the use of natural products in the management of COVID-19, despite little or no clinical evidence on their efficacy and safety. Natural products may hold a great potential in the fight against COVID-19 but without detailed clinical trials, their potency against the virus and their safe use cannot be established. To attain this goal, extensive research followed by clinical studies are needed. Collaborative efforts between researchers, clinicians, governments and traditional medicinal practitioners in the search and development of safe and effective therapeutics from natural products for the treatment of COVID-19 could be a potential option."
