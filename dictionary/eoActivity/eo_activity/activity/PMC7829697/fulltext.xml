Medicinal plants and their bioactive molecules are potential candidates for improving human health. In this work, we studied the effect of <italic>Ptychotis verticillata</italic> (PV) essential oil and its derivatives, carvacrol and thymol, in AML cell lines. We demonstrated that a combination of carvacrol and thymol induced tumor cell death with low toxicity on normal cells. Mechanistically, we highlighted that different molecular pathways, including apoptosis, oxidative, reticular stress, autophagy, and necrosis, are implicated in this potential synergistic effect. Using quantitative RT-PCR, Western blotting, and apoptosis inhibitors, we showed that cell death induced by the carvacrol and thymol combination is caspase-dependent in the HL60 cell line and caspase-independent in the other cell lines tested. Further investigations should focus on improving the manufacturing of these compounds and understanding their anti-tumoral mechanisms of action. These efforts will lead to an increase in the efficiency of the oncotherapy strategy regarding AML.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>AML-cancer therapy</kwd><kwd>drug combination-synergy</kwd><kwd>bioactive molecules</kwd><kwd>cell death</kwd><kwd>apoptotic and non-apoptotic pathways</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-molecules-26-00410"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous hematopoietic stem cell disease that may be cured in some patients with intensive chemotherapy and/or allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) [<xref rid="B1-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Despite the approval of new targeted treatments, including FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) or antiapoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) protein inhibitors, up to 50% of AML patients will eventually relapse or die. The major reasons that may explain why patients are not cured are the inability of the treatment to eliminate all cancerous cells and drug-related toxicity to different organs [<xref rid="B2-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Cell death evasion mechanisms are a hallmark of tumor resistance to chemotherapy [<xref rid="B1-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The major challenge of new anticancer therapeutic solutions is to reactivate cell death programs in cancer cells while having low toxicity to normal cells. An increasing number of studies have shown the beneficial effects of different medicinal plant extracts. Accumulating evidence shows that medicinal plant compounds exert damaging effects on cancer cells. Bioactive molecules are capable of killing cancerous cells through various molecular mechanisms, including intrinsic or extrinsic caspase-dependent apoptosis, autophagy, and necroptosis [<xref rid="B1-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. <italic>Ptychotis verticillata</italic> (PV) is an endemic Maghrebian plant used in traditional medicine for the treatment of fever, muscle spasms, urinary infections, diabetes, and hypotension [<xref rid="B3-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The essential oil (EO) of PV contains several compounds, mostly phenolic components (48.0%) with carvacrol (44.6%) and thymol (3.4%) as the main compounds [<xref rid="B5-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The chemical structure of carvacrol and thymol is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f001">Figure 1</xref> using Microsoft paint software (Microsoft, Corp., Redmond, WA, USA). Few works have been devoted to this plant, and they have only focused on its antimicrobial and antidiabetic effects. Thus, no study has been published to show the anticancer effect of <italic>Ptychotis verticillata</italic> (PV) essential oil (EO) or its cytotoxic effect on normal cells. Recently, we have demonstrated that EO of PV and its constituents, carvacrol and thymol, have shown beneficial effects on different biological features of mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) such as stimulating proliferation and preventing cellular cytotoxicity [<xref rid="B6-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>The novelty and originality of our work is to assess the anticancer effect of PV-derived EO and the combination of its two main components on different AML cell lines. We have also evaluated the potential synergistic effect of carvacrol and thymol combination regarding leukemic cell death. Drug combinations are a well-established form of cancer treatment [<xref rid="B7-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Administering more than one drug can provide many benefits: higher efficacy, lower toxicity, and at least delayed onset of acquired drug resistance [<xref rid="B8-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Such compounds act on tumors by inducing cell death through different pathways [<xref rid="B11-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Most of the studies on the cytotoxic effects of plant bioactive components are limited to the effect of single components, while their impact is normally due to the combination of multiple components. At this time, no published work has studied the effect of the combination of these two compounds on cancer cell death induction or the molecular mechanisms associated with it. Our results open the door to the establishment of new anticancer therapeutic strategies for treating AML by focusing on the relevance of the combination of carvacrol and thymol in inducing a potential synergistic cell death of cancer cell lines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-molecules-26-00410"><title>2. Results</title><sec id="sec2dot1-molecules-26-00410"><title>2.1. Cytotoxic Effects of Ptychotis Verticillata (PV) Extract Oil on Myeloid Leukemic Cell Lines</title><p>First, we treated the leukemic cell lines K562, HL60, and KG1 with different concentrations of the PV EO extract. These cell lines were selected since they partially reflect the molecular heterogeneity of myelo&#x000ef;d leukemia. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f002">Figure 2</xref>, the EO of PV is capable of inducing cell death after 24 h of treatment at a concentration of 0.01% in both HL60 and KG1 cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f002">Figure 2</xref>A,B). Although less sensitive at this concentration, most K562 cells are killed using a concentration of 0.02%, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f002">Figure 2</xref>A,B. The K562 cell death induced by EO is associated with a high level of annexin+/PI-cells, suggesting the implication of apoptosis pathways. Interestingly, these two concentrations (0.01% and 0.02%) are not toxic to normal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f002">Figure 2</xref>B). The treatment of PBMCs isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy donors with different concentrations of HE was toxic only at very high concentrations (0.04%) (data not shown). These results show that PV EO induces cell death in HL60, KG1, and K562 at concentrations that are not toxic to normal cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-molecules-26-00410"><title>2.2. Potential Synergistic Cell Death Induction by Thymol and Carvacrol on Myelo&#x000ef;d Leukemic Cell Lines</title><p>As known, PV EO is mainly composed of phenolic compounds (48.0%) with carvacrol (44.6%) and thymol (3.4%) as the majors active compounds [<xref rid="B5-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In this part of the work, we studied the combined effect of carvacrol (car) and thymol (thy) on myeloid leukemic cell death. We first tested different concentrations of thymol and carvacrol to determine the concentrations that could be used to study their potential synergistic effect. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f003">Figure 3</xref>, KG1 cell lines are very sensitive to carvacrol at 300 &#x000b5;M compared to the HL60 line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f004">Figure 4</xref>), while the K562 line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f005">Figure 5</xref>) shows resistance after 48 h treatment at 400 &#x000b5;M carvacrol. For thymol, at 50 &#x000b5;M, KG1 cells are sensitive compared to the other two lines. At 100 &#x000b5;M, thymol can induce complete cell death of KG1 and HL60 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f004">Figure 4</xref>), whereas around 50% of K562 cells resist cell death after 48 h of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Based on these results, we tested two different concentrations of thymol (25 &#x000b5;M and 50 &#x000b5;M) and carvacrol (200 &#x000b5;M and 300 &#x000b5;M) to study their potential synergistic effect. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f003">Figure 3</xref>, for the KG1 cell line, we observed the potential synergistic effect of thymol and carvacrol at the different combinations of drug concentrations after both 24 and 48 h of treatment. For the HL60 line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f004">Figure 4</xref>), the potential synergistic effect is more pronounced for the 200 &#x000b5;M car/50 &#x000b5;M thy and 300 &#x003bc;M car/50 &#x000b5;M thy combinations than in other combinations. Indeed, for this cell line, more than 80% of cells remained alive after an individual treatment of the two drugs, but their combination eliminated almost all the cancerous cells. Interestingly, for the K562 cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f005">Figure 5</xref>) that was less sensitive to individual concentrations of carvacrol and thymol (more than 90% viability after 48 h of treatment with 300 &#x000b5;M carvacrol or 50 &#x000b5;M thymol), the combination of the two drugs was able to kill 70% of the malignant cells. Then, we tested the toxicity of these two drugs on PBMCs from healthy donors. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f006">Figure 6</xref>, carvacrol and thymol show toxicity at very high concentrations (carvacrol 400 &#x000b5;M and thymol 100 &#x000b5;M), but more than 50% of PBMCs remain viable after 48 h of treatment. Indeed, when combining the two drugs, more than 50% of the normal cells remain alive even at concentrations that are able to eliminate all KG1 and HL60 cells and more than 70% of K562-resistant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f003">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f005">Figure 5</xref>). These results suggest that much of the observed antileukemic effect of PV EO could be due to the presence of thymol and carvacrol and that the combination of the two drugs can eliminate even the K562-resistant cells, while presenting less toxicity to normal cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-molecules-26-00410"><title>2.3. Carvacrol- and Thymol Combination-Induced Cell Death Is Associated with Apoptotic, Oxidative, and Cell Stress Pathways (Gene and Protein Levels)</title><sec id="sec2dot3dot1-molecules-26-00410"><title>2.3.1. Upregulation of Proapoptotic Gene Expression</title><p>Different pathways are associated with drug-induced cell death, and it is important to elucidate cell death mechanisms to improve the efficacy of any tested anticancer molecule. Using the allophycocyanin annexin V conjugate (APC&#x02013;annexin), which is useful for detecting translocated phosphatidylserine (PS), a hallmark of apoptosis, we detected a wide range of annexin+/PI-HL60 (34%), K562 (8%) and KG1 (10%) cells even after 48 h of carvacrol and thymol treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f007">Figure 7</xref>A). Based on these results, we analyzed the expression of genes that are responsible for apoptotic cell death using a gene expression array from Qiagen. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f007">Figure 7</xref>B, Car&#x02013;thy combination-induced cell death is associated with a significantly upregulated expression of proapoptotic genes, such as BBC3, BNIPL, GADD45A, TP53, BAX, CD40, CD40LG, SYCP2, ATP6V1G2, NOL3, BIRC2, TNF, and FASLG. Some of these genes are significantly upregulated in all three cell lines, while the others are upregulated but statistically significant in only one or two of the cell lines. The BAX gene is overexpressed only in the HL60 line, whereas the caspase 8-like gene (CFLAR) is overexpressed in this cell line and underexpressed in the KG1 and K562 cell lines. The expression of CASP3, CASP7, and CASP9 was elevated but the only significant changes were caspase-9 and caspase-7 in the HL60 cell line. Interestingly, some antiapoptotic genes are also expressed: IGF1R, TRAF2, BIRC3, and XIAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f007">Figure 7</xref>C). This could be explained by a stress response that induces the expression of genes as a protective response to cell death.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3dot2-molecules-26-00410"><title>2.3.2. Differential Modulation of the Oxidative and Stress Gene Pathways</title><p>The expression of certain proapoptotic genes known to be responsible for DNA damage and able to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cell stress prompted us to analyze the expression of certain genes involved in oxidative and cellular stress. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f007">Figure 7</xref>D, cell death induced by the potential synergistic effect is associated with the underexpression of PRDX3, GSTP1, SOD2, and TGFB, which provide antioxidant or ROS production inhibitor function. We also observed the overexpression of TXNRD1, which can serve as an ROS generator, and the overexpression of heat shock proteins and ATF4, which play an important role in reticular stress. These results suggest the involvement of apoptotic and cellular stress pathways in cell death induced by the carvacrol and thymol combination.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3dot3-molecules-26-00410"><title>2.3.3. Protein Confirmation of Apoptotic and Reticular Stress Signaling Pathway Implication</title><p>To confirm the results obtained in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f007">Figure 7</xref>D, the expression of these genes was analyzed by Western blot. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f008">Figure 8</xref>, the carvacrol and thymol combination shows a potential synergistic effect by inducing the decrease of procaspase-3 and procaspase-9 expression and the increase of CHOP expression. CHOP is involved in reticular stress, and it is known that ROS can trigger endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress or vice versa in vivo and in vitro [<xref rid="B13-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. We also analyzed the protein expression of PI3K and p-AKT to determine how the carvacrol and thymol combination may modulate the antiapoptotic mechanisms of cell death resistance. As previously stated, we observed an upregulation of insulin growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) gene expression in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f007">Figure 7</xref>C. This is important, as a sustained activation of AKT/mTOR in malignant-resistant cells is regulated by the upregulation of the IGF1R [<xref rid="B14-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f008">Figure 8</xref>, the potential synergistic effect of carvacrol and thymol in the induction of leukemic cell death is also associated with the decrease of PI3K and p-AKT protein expression in combination-treated cells compared to vehicle and cells treated with carvacrol or thymol separately. These Western blot results confirm that the combination of carvacrol and thymol induces cell death through apoptotic, oxidative, and cell stress pathways. Gene and protein expression profiling indicates that the potential synergistic effect of this combination is associated with both cell death and antiproliferative signaling pathways.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-molecules-26-00410"><title>2.4. Carvacrol- and Thymol Combination-Induced Potential Synergistic Cell Death Is Associated with Nonapoptotic Pathways</title><sec id="sec2dot4dot1-molecules-26-00410"><title>2.4.1. Dependence on Caspases Activation and ROS Generation Pathways</title><p>To determine if alternative molecular mechanisms might be involved in the cell death induced by the combination of carvacrol and thymol, we first studied the dependence of this induced cell death on the caspase activation pathway and on ROS generation. The cells were treated with Z-VAD-FMK, a pan caspase inhibitor, 1 h before treatment with both drugs. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f009">Figure 9</xref>A, only the HL60 line had a dependence on the caspase pathway. Indeed, in this cell line, pretreatment with a caspase inhibitor abrogated the car&#x02013;thy-induced cell death. The other two cell lines showed no significant change in the cell death level following the inhibition of caspases. In addition, the use of the ROS scavenger <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-<sc>l</sc>-cysteine (NAC) had no effect on car&#x02013;thy-induced cell death in the three cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f009">Figure 9</xref>B). These results suggest that the ability of the combination of the two drugs to induce other cell death pathways is independent of caspase activation and ROS generation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4dot2-molecules-26-00410"><title>2.4.2. Implication of Autophagy and Necrosis Pathways</title><p>Cell death is often regulated by multiple molecular pathways and mechanisms, including apoptosis, autophagy, and necrosis. The molecular network underlying these processes is often intertwined, and one pathway can dynamically shift to another due to the role of certain genes, such as TP53, TNF, and ATF4, in different cell death pathways. Therefore, we analyzed the expression of genes involved in autophagy and necrosis in the three cell lines treated with the combination of carvacrol and thymol. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f010">Figure 10</xref>, car&#x02013;thy-induced cell death is associated with the overexpression of genes implicated in autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f010">Figure 10</xref>A), including ULK1, SQSTM1, ATG12, GAA, INS, MAP1LC3A, and TP53, and necrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f010">Figure 10</xref>B), such as HSPBAP1, FOXI1, DENND4A, C1orf159, PARP1, PARP2, PVR, ATP6V1G2, BMF, DPYSL4, and GALNT5. A few of these genes are significantly upregulated in the three cell lines, while others are upregulated but statistically significant in only two cell lines. Together, these results showed that car&#x02013;thy-induced cell death in leukemic cells, except in HL60 cells, is associated with non-apoptotic and caspase-independent pathways in leukemic cell lines. The induced cell death in the HL60 cell line is caspase-dependent, ROS production-independent, and associated with non-apoptotic pathways. In conclusion, the combination of thymol and carvacrol has a potential synergistic effect on myeloid leukemia cell death induction by apoptotic and non-apoptotic pathways.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec3-molecules-26-00410"><title>3. Discussion</title><p>Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide. Despite intensive research on the treatment of this disease, the molecules on the market face different obstacles. The high cost of treatment, the molecular heterogeneity of cancer cells, and the development of drug resistance are the major challenges to be overcome. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer of the myeloid lineage of blood cells, with high molecular and genetic heterogeneity. The treatment is still expensive and may be associated with several side effects [<xref rid="B15-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Despite the development of stem cell transplantation, more than 50% of patients relapse. Herbal remedies and their bioactive molecules are potential candidates for improving human health. Natural compounds from certain plants exhibit antiproliferative properties and cell death induction in various cancers through different pathways, including apoptosis, autophagy, and necroptosis [<xref rid="B1-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The ability of these compounds to eliminate tumor cells both ex vivo and in vivo suggests their potential as new anticancer therapeutics. <italic>Ptychotis verticillata</italic> (PV) is a plant used in traditional medicine to treat diabetes, hypertension, and other diseases. <italic>Ptychotis verticillata</italic> (PV) is a plant known by the vernacular name &#x0201c;N&#x000fb;nkha&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;Nanunkha&#x0201d;. It belongs to the Apiaceae or Umbelliferae family, and it grows spontaneously in North Africa, from Morocco to Libya. It is also found throughout the Mediterranean basin. PV is an annual plant with a slender taproot, rod erect, striated, and slender, with many spreading branches from 10 to 40 cm, without rosette of basal leaves. In Morocco, N&#x000fb;nkha is an aromatic and medicinal plant mainly found in the eastern region [<xref rid="B5-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. PV is widely used in traditional medicine as an infusion to treat headache, fever, flu, diarrhea, diabetes, and hypertension [<xref rid="B16-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The use of individual compounds or in combination rather than the essential oil is a relevant question to be investigated. In fact, additional information regarding the composition of the PV is needed. Analysis of the chemical composition of PV essential oil from Morocco was carried out using GC and GC-mass spectrometry. The oil was dominated by phenolic compounds (48.0%) with carvacrol (44.6%) and thymol (3.4%) as the main compounds. Plant phenolics constitute one of the major groups of components that act as primary antioxidant free radical terminators [<xref rid="B5-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The amounts of total phenolics and flavonoids in the solvent extracts (diethyl ether and ethyl acetate) were determined spectrometrically. Furthermore, the antioxidant activities of the essential oil and extracts were determined using a DPPH test system. The DPPH scavenging activity of extracts increased in the order ethyl acetate &#x0003e; ascorbic acid &#x0003e; diethyl ether &#x0003e; essential oil. The antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of <italic>P. verticillata</italic> (EOPV) and its different fractions has shown a higher inhibitory effect on different bacterial strains [<xref rid="B17-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Thus, PV is a potential rich source of antimicrobial agents against many microorganisms and could be used as an antibiotic or alternative. Although some reports have shown the anticancer effect of thymol and carvacrol, no study has yet evaluated the combination of these two molecules against malignant cells. Most importantly, looking for a potential synergistic action of these active compounds is required for an efficient treatment.</p><p>The originality and novelty of our work is to demonstrate the anticancer effect of PV EO and the potential synergistic combination of its two components, carvacrol and thymol, against myeloid leukemic cell lines. This is the first time that a study has investigated the anticancer effect of PV EO or its cytotoxic effect on normal cells. Our results showed that the 0.01% and 0.02% concentrations of PV EO, which are nontoxic to normal cells, can eradicate all leukemic cells, suggesting that the oil constituents play a dual role in cell viability. At similar concentrations, they can kill cancerous cells, and on the other hand, they are able to protect normal cells from drug toxicity. Recently, we showed that Ptychotis verticillate EO, carvacrol, and thymol have several positive effects on MSCs, which are known to be an important immunotherapeutic cell product [<xref rid="B18-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. By preserving their morphology, sustaining their viability, promoting their proliferation, and protecting them from cytotoxicity and oxidative stress, PV appears to be a promising natural medicinal product for strengthening the therapeutic effects of MSCs [<xref rid="B6-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Several studies have shown that carvacrol or thymol may individually induce, in vitro and in vivo (animal models), cancer cell death through the deregulation of different genes involved in cell proliferation and the apoptosis signaling pathway [<xref rid="B11-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. For leukemic cells, previous studies have shown that both carvacrol and thymol individually showed cytotoxic effects on the HL60 cell line by inducing apoptotic cell death [<xref rid="B19-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, at this time, no published work addressed the effect of the combination of these two molecules on the induction of cancer cell death. Thus, we aimed to investigate the anticancer activity of the combination of carvacrol and thymol in three different leukemic cell lines that are able to partially represent the molecular heterogeneity of AML [<xref rid="B21-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Our results showed a potential synergistic effect of thymol and carvacrol at the different combinations used in the KG1 and HL60 cell lines. Interestingly, for the K562 cell line, which was far less sensitive to individual treatment with carvacrol or thymol, the combination of the two drugs was able to eliminate 70% of K562 cancer cells. The drug concentrations used are toxic to normal cells, but more than 50% of the cells remain alive, even at concentrations that can eliminate all KG1 and HL60 cells and more than 70% of K562-resistant cells. These results show that much of the observed antileukemic effect of PV EO is due to the presence of thymol and carvacrol and that the combination of the two drugs can eliminate even the K562-resistant cells while presenting less toxicity to normal cells. However, the nontoxic effect of EO compared to the combination of carvacrol and thymol (car&#x02013;thy) in normal cells may be due to the existence of other compounds in EO that protect normal cells from cytotoxicity and oxidative stress. These results prompted us to study the molecular mechanisms involved in this cell death induced by the potential synergistic effect. Our results showed a wide range of annexin+/PI-cells (especially for HL60 cell lines) after carvacrol and thymol treatment associated with the expression of the proapoptotic genes BBC3, GADD45A, TP53, BCL2L11, BAX, CD40, CD40LG, SYCP2, ATP6V1G2, NOL3, TNF, and FASLG. We confirmed by Western blotting that the induction of leukemia cell death is associated with apoptotic pathways, as shown by the strong decrease in procaspase-3 and procaspase-9 in cells treated with the combination of carvacrol and thymol. The GADD45A gene is an indicator of DNA damage and plays a role in drug-induced apoptosis with the involvement of stress-induced MAPK8 [<xref rid="B22-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The DNA damage-induced transcription of this gene is mediated by both p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms. Our results showed an increase in TP53 and GADD45A expression after car&#x02013;thy treatment, suggesting that DNA damage and oxidative stress are involved in car&#x02013;thy-induced cell death. It was shown that p53 promotes the expression BBC3 (also upregulated in our results), leading to increased intracellular ROS levels and apoptosis induction [<xref rid="B23-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. BBC3-induced apoptosis is directly associated with ROS generation [<xref rid="B24-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Our cell and oxidative stress transcriptomic results confirm the involvement of ROS in car&#x02013;thy-induced cell death. Indeed, the potential synergistic effect is associated with the underexpression of PRDX3, GSTP1, and SOD2, which provide antioxidant or ROS generation inhibitor functions, as well as the overexpression of TXNRD1, which can serve as an ROS generator [<xref rid="B25-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Our results also showed downregulation of the TGFB gene, which is known to control ROS production directly or by downregulating antioxidative systems [<xref rid="B26-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is also increased by TGF-&#x003b2; downregulation, which triggers Akt inactivation in cancer cell death [<xref rid="B13-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The failure of leukemic cells to resist this potential synergistic effect may be explained by the upregulation of antiapoptotic genes, such as the insulin growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R). In cancer-resistant cells, the sustained activation of the AKT/mTOR is regulated by the upregulation of IGF1R [<xref rid="B14-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], which plays a determinate role in promoting resistance to PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors. Our Western blot results confirmed this failure to resist to cell death probably due to a decrease in PI3K and p-AKT expression in combination-treated cells compared to untreated cells and cells treated with carvacrol or thymol alone. Furthermore, the overexpression of the proapoptotic gene BCL211 (BIM) could reinforce this resistance failure. Indeed, Locatelli et al. demonstrated the role of BIM in arsenic trioxide-induced ovarian cancer cell death through the activation of caspase-3 and dephosphorylation of p-AKT [<xref rid="B27-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. These results suggest that the potential synergistic effect of car&#x02013;thy can escape the mechanisms of cell death resistance in part by inhibiting cell proliferation through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. In addition, accumulating evidence suggests the interrelation of ROS and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER) with redox signaling mediators [<xref rid="B28-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. ROS can trigger endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress or vice versa in vivo and in vitro [<xref rid="B13-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Under prolonged and severe ER stress conditions, the unfolded protein response (UPR) can become cytotoxic (including apoptosis) rather than cytoprotective. Interestingly, in our results, car&#x02013;thy-induced cell death is associated with the upregulation of ATF4, which is one of the UPR-dependent signaling proteins. C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) is another important component of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. CHOP knockdown significantly attenuated ER stress-induced apoptosis in hepatocarcinoma cells [<xref rid="B29-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. CHOP and ATF4 cooperate to induce cell death, although how this is achieved is still not completely understood [<xref rid="B30-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Our Western blot results showed an increase in CHOP levels in cells treated with the drug combination and confirmed the implication of ER stress in car&#x02013;thy-induced leukemic cell death. Together, these results show that the association of carvacrol and thymol induces cell death through apoptotic, oxidative, and reticular stress pathways and suggest that all these mechanisms collaborate to escape cancer cell death resistance. Human cancer treatment strategies ultimately rest on the ability of cancer therapeutics to induce tumor-specific cell death. However, cancer cells, because of their molecular heterogeneity, may present genetic or epigenetic modifications of certain pathways that render them unresponsive to treatment [<xref rid="B31-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The car&#x02013;thy-induced cell death transcriptomic profile shows the expression of certain antiapoptotic genes as well as the expression of antioxidant genes. In addition, the expression profile of certain genes following the cell death induced by the potential synergistic effect of the two drugs depends on the molecular heterogeneity of the different cell lines; for example, the BBC3, TP53, CD40, ATP6V1G2, and NOL3 genes are significantly upregulated following drug treatment in KG1 and K562 cells, whereas BAX and CFLAR (caspase-8-like) genes are only upregulated in HL60 cells. Our studies of cell death dependence on the caspase pathway and ROS generation showed that cell death induced by the potential synergistic effect of car&#x02013;thy is independent of both pathways in all the cell lines treated, except for HL60, which shows a strong dependence on the caspase pathway. These results could partly explain the overexpression of Bax and CFLAR in this cell line following treatment and the inability of HL60 to express certain genes that may play a role in both apoptotic and nonapoptotic cell death pathways, such as CD40, TNF, TP53, ATF4, and ATP6V1G2 [<xref rid="B32-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Cell death is often regulated by multiple molecular pathways and mechanisms, including apoptosis, autophagy, and necroptosis. The molecular networks driving these different processes are linked, and one pathway may dynamically evolve to another, particularly during cell treatment with various drugs [<xref rid="B36-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. To determine the non-apoptotic pathways induced by the car&#x02013;thy combination, we analyzed the profile of a set of genes involved in autophagy and necrosis. The results showed the overexpression of a set of genes that are involved in both pathways. The comparison of the different lines according to apoptosis dependence did not show a large demarcation between the HL60 line and the other cell lines. However, we observed a significant increase in the expression of some genes, including necrosis genes BMF, DPYSL, and JPH3 and autophagic genes INS and TP53, in only the KG1 and K562 cell lines, in which car&#x02013;thy-induced cell death is caspase independent. It seems that the inability of car&#x02013;thy to induce the expression of certain genes that allow the switch between the different pathways in HL60 is one of the causes of the dependence of this line on the caspase pathway. However, this dependence does not seem to be absolute. An extension in car&#x02013;thy treatment time restores cell death even in the presence of caspase inhibitor. This could be explained by the induction of the expression of a dozen autophagy and necrosis genes in this cell line in response to car&#x02013;thy.</p><p>Collectively, these results show that the combination of carvacrol and thymol induce a potential synergistic cell-death effect against acute leukemia cells by activating apoptotic, oxidative, and reticular stress pathways. In addition, the activation of non-apoptotic pathways such as autophagy and necrosis may participate in this induced cell death. Therefore, we determined that several molecular pathways are modulated both at gene and protein levels. These results may contribute to the efforts in developing a safe and efficient anti-AML strategy based on thymol and carvacrol combination. Both of these molecules should be therapeutically evaluated using mouse models and ultimately clinical trials. For instance, there are few clinical data regarding these molecules. In this context, carvacrol has been approved as a food additive by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and added in the list of chemical flavorings by the Council of Europe. It is known that carvacrol has several pharmacological properties including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antitumor, and antimicrobial effects [<xref rid="B12-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A clinical study that was conducted to assess the effect of carvacrol on respiratory symptoms in the veterans exposed to sulfur mustard (SM) showed that two months of treatment with carvacrol reduced inflammatory cytokine and chemokine but increased anti-inflammatory cytokines. Such treatment also improved respiratory symptom and forced expiratory volume&#x02014;one value second in SM-exposed patients [<xref rid="B37-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Another Phase II clinical trial was conducted in 2018 to examine the preventive effect of carvacrol in asthmatic patients during a 2-month treatment period. Pulmonary function tests in these carvacrol-received patients were increased, and respiratory symptoms and inflammatory parameters were reduced, which indicates its therapeutic effect on asthma [<xref rid="B38-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In contrast, the vast majority of the published studies regarding thymol are in vitro or preclinical data. In all of these studies, thymol pre- and co-treatment in rats appear devoid of any deleterious effects, which is suggestive of its safety [<xref rid="B11-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These studies recommend performing clinical trials to determine the exact dosage of thymol against cancer disease in humans. Interestingly, the effect of feeding a carvacrol&#x02013;thymol blend supplemented diet was evaluated in piglets in which weaning induced intestinal oxidative stress and dysfunction of the intestinal barrier [<xref rid="B39-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The results indicated that dietary supplementation with carvacrol&#x02013;thymol decreased the intestinal oxidative stress and influenced selected microbial populations without changing the biomarkers of intestinal barrier in weaning piglets. Therefore, it is recommended that experiments using mouse models and ultimately clinical trials are implemented to evaluate the combination of carvacrol and thymol for the management of AML. The amelioration of compound manufacturing and characterization is also an important feature for developing a safe, quality, and efficient natural therapeutic product. Comprehensive therapeutic and toxicological studies using the carvacrol&#x02013;thymol combination should be conducted using animal models (e.g., leukemic mouse models) followed by well-designed clinical studies. Collectively, increasing the knowledge regarding the potential synergistic anti-tumoral mechanisms of action of the thymol and carvacrol combination will provide new onco-therapeutic perspectives for the management of AML.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-molecules-26-00410"><title>4.
