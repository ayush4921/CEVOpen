    "<h4>Background</h4>Induced polyploidy serves as an efficient approach in extricating genetic potential of cells. During polyploidization, multiple sets of chromosomes are derived from the same organism resulting in the development of an autopolyploid. Alterations owing to artificially induced polyploidy level significantly influence internal homeostatic condition of resultant cells.<h4>Main text</h4>Induced autopolyploidy transpires as a result of an increase in the size of genome without any change in elementary genetic material. Such autopolyploidy, artificially induced via application of antimitotic agents, brings about a lot of beneficial changes in plants, coupled with very few detrimental effects. Induced autopolyploids exhibit superior adaptability, endurance to biotic and abiotic stresses, longer reproductive period and enzyme diversity coupled with enhanced rate of photosynthesis and gene action in comparison to their diploid counterparts. However, reduced rate of transpiration and growth, delay in flowering are some of the demerits of autopolyploids. Inspite of these slight unfavourable outcomes, induced autopolyploidization has been utilized in an array of instances wherein genetic improvement of plant species is concerned, since this technique usually boosts the biomass of concerned economic parts of a plant. In other way, it is also evident that multiplication of genome bestows enhanced production of secondary metabolites, which has contributed to a significant commercial value addition especially for plants with medicinal importance, in particular.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This review makes an attempt to explore the system and success of antimitotic agents vis-Ã -vis artificial autopolyploidization, interfered with the biosynthesis-cum-production of secondary metabolites having cutting-edge pharmaceutical importance."
