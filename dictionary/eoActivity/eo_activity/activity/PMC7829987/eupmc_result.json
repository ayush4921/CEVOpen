    "Obesity, a condition characterized by excessive accumulation of body fat, is a metabolic disorder related to an increased risk of chronic inflammation. Obesity is mediated by signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3, which is regulated by genes associated with retinoid-interferon-induced mortality (GRIM) 19, a protein ubiquitously expressed in various human tissues. In this study, we investigated the role of GRIM19 in diet-induced obese C57BL/6 mice via intravenous or intramuscular administration of a plasmid encoding GRIM19. Splenocytes from wild-type and GRIM19-overexpressing mice were compared using enzyme-linked immunoassay, real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, flow cytometry, and histological analyses. GRIM19 attenuated the progression of obesity by regulating STAT3 activity and enhancing brown adipose tissue (BAT) differentiation. GRIM19 regulated the differentiation of mouse-derived 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into adipocytes, while modulating gene expression in white adipose tissue (WAT) and BAT. GRIM19 overexpression reduced diet-induced obesity and enhanced glucose and lipid metabolism in the liver. Moreover, GRIM19 overexpression reduced WAT differentiation and induced BAT differentiation in obese mice. GRIM19-transgenic mice exhibited reduced mitochondrial superoxide levels and a reciprocal balance between Th17 and Treg cells. These results suggest that GRIM19 attenuates the progression of obesity by controlling adipocyte differentiation."
