    "Cadmium is a heavy metal that pollutes the environment and affects plants physiologically and morphologically. Selenium is considered as a beneficial element, with effective roles in increasing plant tolerance to environmental stresses. A greenhouse factorial pot experiment was conducted to study the impact of selenium on traits of Savory plants under Cd stress. Experimental factors included soil contamination with cadmium (0, 75, 100, and 150 μM) and foliar spraying of selenium (0, 10, 20, and 40 μM of Sodium Selenate). Biomass, photosynthetic pigments including chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, total chlorophyll, proline, total soluble solids, cell membrane leakage, relative water content of leaves antioxidant enzymes, and Cd and Zn concentration in shoot and root were recorded. Results revealed that Cd stress decreased vegetative growth criteria, photosynthetic pigments include chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, total chlorophyll, and carotenoid almost, 55%, 57%, 57%, and 68%, respectively, while poline, cell membrane leakage, peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT) antioxidant enzymes were increased with increasing Cd concentrations. Foliar spray of selenium reduced the toxic effects of Cd stress on savory plants via enhancing of proline content and stimulation of CAT and POD enzymes and limitation of cell membrane leakage. Also, selenium foliar spray improved chlorophyll content under Cd stress condition and decreased cadmium accumulation 29% in root, respectively. In general, these results suggest that foliar application of selenium could mitigate Cd toxicity and improve growth and antioxidant capacity of savory under different level of cadmium heavy metal stress."
