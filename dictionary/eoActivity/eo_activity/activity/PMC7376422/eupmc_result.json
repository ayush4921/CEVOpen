    "<h4>Objective</h4>Chinese Medicinal Properties (CMP) play a vital role in theoretical research and clinical practice. However, the traditional CMP system is subjective, qualitative, fixed, inconsistent, and obscured. Nowadays, quantifying CMP research achieved a notable progress. This study aims to review and reflect the relevance between qualitative CMP and quantitative material components.<h4>Methods</h4>A raw literature search was performed firstly in CNKI and Pubmed database to get a rough idea on the general advances in measuring CMP. Then, a strict literature search and data extraction from two dependent research studies were performed to analyze the relevance and discrimination between CMP and material components.<h4>Results</h4>The quantitative CMP research mainly focused on the microelements and chemical compositions. The largest microelements research listed 747 Chinese Materia Medica (CMM) (6780 flavors) and 120,000 element data. The measurement of chemical composition of CMM has risen rapidly in the 1990s and continues till the present. Thirty-seven articles were finally identified for the relevance analysis of CMP and material components. Of these, 18 and 19 articles correspondingly focused on the chemical compositions and microelements, and 26 and 11 articles correspondingly focused on their correlation and discrimination relationship. The most commonly used method for correlation analysis is intuitive analysis. The support vector machine maybe highly efficient and would act as the preferred method in discriminant analysis. Twelve (67%) and 5 (26%) articles' data came from the literature search in chemical compositions and microelement research studies. Four studies indicated that the research objects are the basic substances and material basis of CMP, 15 articles claimed that the chemical compositions were significantly related to CMP, 12 research studies concluded that the regularity and causality were identified between the research objects and CMP, and 9 research studies successfully established discriminant models for CMP basing on the detected substances.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The relevance research between qualitative CMP and quantitative material components achieved a positive progress, though it is weak and defective. Standardizing the qualitative CMP system, establishing series comprehensive databases for the material components, innovating statistical and data mining methods, and integrating doctors' experiences are important and feasible for future research."
