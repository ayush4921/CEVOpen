    "Thanks to their promising properties, essential oils (EOs) have strong potential to remedy several problems such as microorganisms acquired resistance to antimicrobial agents and chemical antioxidants toxicity. Firstly, this work was conducted to determine chemical composition, antioxydant activity, then antibacterial, antifungal, antimycobacterial properties of Rosmarinus officinalis EO. Secondly, EOs combined antimicrobial effect with carvacrol was assessed. Chemical EO analysis was performed using Gas chromatography/mass spectrometer. 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl test was used to evaluate in vitro antioxidant rosemary oil effect. The antimicrobial activity against seven bacteria, two fungi, and two mycobacterial strains was screened using the broth microdilution method. Thereafter, the checkerboard essay was used to evaluate the antibacterial effect of this EO and Carvacrol. Chemical EO analysis revealed 1,8-cineole (33.88%), camphor (14.66%), and α-pinene (12.76%) as main constituents. The obtained IC50 value (2.77 mg/mL) showed rosemary EO's radical scavenging power. Moreover, all tested microorganisms showed an important sensitivity to this EO (MIC values: 0.007%-1% (v/v)). Furthermore, results highlighted synergistic and partial synergistic interaction for tested products. The studied EO has both antimicrobial and antioxidant potentials. Combined application showed a remarkable synergistic antibacterial potentiation that can be used as an alternative in pharmaceutical and food processing sectors."
