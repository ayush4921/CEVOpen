    "Introduction:Pistacia atlantica subsp. kurdica is an important food source and a well-known medicinal plant in the Zagros Mountains of Iran. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of P. atlantica extract and essential oil in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. Materials and Methods:Different doses of hydroalcoholic extract and essential oil of P. atlantica subsp. kurdica (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg) were given to streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice in separate groups for three weeks. At the end of treatment, blood samples were collected; then, oxidative stress markers, TNF-α, and lipid profile were determined in its serum samples. Results:Our findings showed that the administration of P. atlantica extract for three consecutive weeks significantly improved the lipid profile, oxidative stress, and inflammation process by reducing lipid peroxidation and increasing total antioxidant capacity. Conclusion:This study showed that P. atlantica subsp. kurdica has antioxidant and blood lipid-lowering effects that can be used as a supplement to improve diabetes complications."
