    "<h4>Introduction</h4>Among the various plants studied, cinnamon has emerged as a potential herbal antimicrobial agent. Besides the medicinal plants, recently probiotics have also been recognized to affect cinnamon bark oil <i>Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans)</i> and other harmful oral and gut microflora.<h4>Aim and objective</h4>This placebo-controlled study aims to compare the antimicrobial potential of cinnamon bark oil incorporated and probiotic blend [<i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> (TSP-Lp1), and <i>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</i> (TSP-Lrh1)] incorporated mucoadhesive patch against salivary <i>S. mutans</i> in caries active 7-10-year-old children.<h4>Design</h4>It was a double-blinded placebo-controlled study with <i>n</i> = 60. They were randomly allotted into three groups-Group I: Cinnamon patch, group II: probiotic patch, and group III: control patch (placebo) with <i>n</i> = 20 in each group.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>The study was carried out in three phases. In the first phase, the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cinnamon bark oil was determined against <i>S. mutans</i> followed by the formulation of cinnamon and probiotic patches. After a washout period of 2 weeks and a collection of baseline saliva samples, these patches were tested on the subjects from respective groups for 14 days with twice a day placement protocol. On the 15th day, saliva samples were collected and cultured, CFU/mL of the saliva of <i>S. mutans</i> for each subject was recorded and compared with baseline samples. Feedback in the form of a questionnaire was obtained from the patients.<h4>Statistical analysis</h4>Descriptive statistics, paired <i>t</i>-test for intragroup comparison, unpaired <i>t</i>-test for intergroup comparison, analysis of variance (ANOVA) for intergroup comparison, and <i>post hoc</i> Scheffe's.<h4>Results</h4>The results showed that both cinnamon patch and probiotic patch were comparable to each other in terms of their anti-<i>S. mutans</i> activity. The intragroup comparison of the CFU/mL count showed a highly significant reduction from baseline to post-intervention for both the groups (<i>p</i> = 0.001).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Both cinnamon and probiotic blend have a strong antimicrobial property owing to their ability to cause significant reduction in salivary <i>S. mutans</i> and both the patches showed good patient acceptance.<h4>How to cite this article</h4>Gandhi HA, Srilatha KT, Deshmukh S, <i>et al.</i> Comparison of Antimicrobial Efficacy of Cinnamon Bark Oil Incorporated and Probiotic Blend Incorporated Mucoadhesive Patch against Salivary <i>Streptococcus mutans</i> in Caries Active 7-10-year-old Children: An <i>In Vivo</i> Study.
