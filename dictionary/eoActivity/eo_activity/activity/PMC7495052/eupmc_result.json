    "In an attempt to reduce the massive application of the toxic chemical pesticides, essential oils (EOs) of <i>Achillea biebersteinii</i> and <i>Juniperus procera</i> were obtained through hydrodistillation and analyzed using (GC-FID) and (GC-MS). α-terpinene and <i>p</i>-cymene were detected as the major components in the EO of <i>A. biebersteinii</i>, while eugenol and <i>ß</i>-caryophyllene were the major constituents in the EO of <i>J. procera</i>. The plant EOs and major fractions act as considerable mosquitocides against <i>Aedes aegypti</i> L, the common transmitter of Dengue fever. The EOs and major fractions were tested at 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 100 μl/l. Insect mortality was time and dose-dependent, and the adult stage was more sensitive than larvae. At a concentration of 50 μl/l, 24 post treatment larval and adult mortality ranged between (40.3 and 89.3%) and (51.4 and 95.6%), respectively. The LC<sub>50</sub> values ranged between 12.2 and 70.1 μl/l against larvae and between 10.1 and 63.12 μl/l against adults. All of the crude EOs were more potent than their major fractions. Eugenol and <i>ß</i>-caryophyllene showed strong mosquitocidal activity than <i>p</i>-cymene and α-terpinene. The corrected percentage mortality was increased over time with all of the test materials. In terms of lethal time required to kill 50% of the population (LT<sub>50</sub>), a concentration of 100 μl/l of <i>J. procera</i> EO showed LT<sub>50</sub> values of 2.3 and 1.7 h against larvae and adult, respectively. The EOs induced considerable inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity, where <i>J. procera</i> crude oil (IC<sub>50</sub> = 13.12mM) and eugenol (IC<sub>50</sub> = 19.65mM) were the most potent. Results proved that the test plant oils and their major fractions could be developed as natural pest control agents to control <i>A. aegypti</i>."
