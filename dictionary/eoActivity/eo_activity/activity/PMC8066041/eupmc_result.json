    "The present research studied the influence of blanching and microwave pretreatment of seeds on the quality of pomegranate seed oil (PSO) extracted by cold pressing. Pomegranate seeds (cv. Acco) were independently blanched (95 ± 2 °C/3 min) and microwave heated (261 W/102 s) before cold pressing. The quality of the extracted oil was evaluated with respect to oxidation indices, refractive index, yellowness index, total carotenoids content, total phenolic content, flavor compounds, fatty acid composition, and 2.2-diphenyl-1-picryl hydrazyl (DPPH) and 2.2-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical scavenging capacity. Blanching and microwave pretreatments of seeds before pressing enhanced oil yield, total phenolic content, flavor compounds, and DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging capacity. Although the levels of oxidation indices, including the peroxide value, free fatty acids, acid value, ρ-anisidine value, and total oxidation value, also increased, and the oil quality conformed to the requirements of the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CODEX STAN 19-1981) standard for cold-pressed vegetable oils. On the other hand, blanching and microwave heating of seeds decreased the pomegranate seed oil's yellowness index, whilst the refractive index was not significantly (<i>p</i> > 0.05) affected. Even though both blanching and microwave pretreatment of seeds added value to the cold-pressed PSO, the oil extracted from blanched seeds exhibited lower oxidation indices. Regarding fatty acids, microwave pretreatment of seeds before cold pressing significantly increased palmitic acid, oleic acid, and linoleic acid, whilst it decreased the level of punicic acid. On the contrary, blanching of seeds did not significantly affect the fatty acid composition of PSO, indicating that the nutritional quality of the oil was not significantly affected. Therefore, blanching of seeds is an appropriate and valuable step that could be incorporated into the mechanical processing of PSO."
