    "<i>Sideritis</i> species are recognized as important medicinal plants and their commercial demand is continuously on the rise both in the European and in the global market. Consequently, the cultivation of <i>Sideritis</i> species has been occurred to successfully meet the need for mass production of high-quality plant material. The present study was undertaken in order to investigate the chemical composition of cultivated <i>S. cypria</i>. Infusions of flowers and leaves were prepared separately, according to the European Medicine Agency (EMA) monograph. The infusion of the flowers revealed the presence of four flavones, isoscutellarein-7-O-[6'″-O-acetyl-β-D-allopyranosyl-(1→2)-β-D-glucopyranoside, its 4'-O-methyl-derivative, 4'-O-methyl-hypolaetin-7-O-[6'″-O-acetyl-β-D-allopyranosyl-(1→2)-β-D-glucopyranoside, and isoscutellarein-7-O-[6'″-O-acetyl-β-D-allopyranosyl-(1→2)]-6″-O-acetyl-β-D-glucopyranoside; four phenylethanoid glucosides, acteoside, leucosceptoside A, lamalboside, and leonoside A; one iridoid, melittoside, and one phenolic acid, chlorogenic acid, while the infusion of the leaves of the same population afforded the same first two flavones; five phenylethanoid glucosides, acteoside, leucosceptoside A, lavandulifolioside, leonoside A, and lamalboside; melittoside and chlorogenic acid. The structural elucidation of the isolated compounds was undertaken by high-field NMR spectroscopy. Moreover, the essential oils of the flowers and leaves were studied by GC-MS, separately. In addition, the mineral, bioactive compounds, protein and carbohydrate contents were evaluated for both plant materials."
