    "The essential oil (EO) of <i>Bassia muricata</i> shoots was extracted via hydro-distillation and then investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Thirty-four compounds were recognized for the first time from this plant, representing 100% of the total mass. Terpenoids represented the major components with 69.17% of the total mass, containing oxygenated sesquiterpenes (53.18%), oxygenated monoterpenes (9.77%), sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (5.03%), and diterpenes (1.19%). Additionaly, 6-methoxy-1-acetonaphthone was the only aromatic compound represented in a high percentage of the total identified compounds with 22.35%. Additionally, a percent of 8.48% of the total mass was hydrocarbons. Only one oxygenated sesquiterpene namely hexahydrofarnesyl acetone representing 47.35% of the total mass was identified. It was followed by methoxy-1-acetonaphthone (19.92%), <i>n</i>-dotriacontane (3.58%), <i>endo</i>-borneol (3.24%), 6-methy-<i>α</i>-ionone (3.04%), and <i>α</i>-gurjunene (2.65%). The EO exhibited moderate antioxidant activity comparable with ascorbic acid as a standard, where it attained IC<sub>50</sub> value of 20.70 µL L<sup>-1</sup> and 16.32 µL L<sup>-1</sup>, for DPPH and ABTS. The EO of <i>B. muricata</i> significantly reduces the germination and seedling development of the weed <i>Chenopodium murale</i>. The EO showed an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 175.60 µL L<sup>-1</sup>, 246.65 µL L<sup>-1</sup>, and 308.33 µL L<sup>-1</sup> for root growth, shoot growth, and germination, respectively. Therefore, this EO could be a good green resource for the control of weeds."
