    "Chronic dietary ingestion of suitable phytochemicals may assist with limiting or negating neurodegenerative decline. Current therapeutics used to treat Alzheimer disease elicit broad adverse drug reactions, and alternative sources of cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) are required. Herein, we screened methanolic extracts from seven commonly cultivated plants for their nutraceutical potential; ability to inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyryl-cholinesterase (BuChE), and provision of antioxidant activity through their 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate (DPPH) free radical scavenging capabilities. Potential neurotoxicity of plant extracts was examined via application to SHSY-5Y neuroblastoma cells and quantitation of cell viability. Methanolic extracts of <i>Citrus limon</i> (Lemon), <i>Bombax ceiba</i> (Red silk-cotton), <i>Lawsonia inermis</i> (Henna), <i>Eucalyptus globulus</i> (Eucalyptus), <i>Ocimum basilicum</i> (Basil), <i>Citrus reticulata</i> (Mandarin orange), and <i>Mentha spicata</i> (Spearmint) all displayed concentration-dependent inhibition of AChE and BuChE. The majority of extracts inhibited AChE and BuChE to near equipotency, with Henna and Eucalyptus extracts the two most potent ChEIs. All plant extracts were able to scavenge free radicals in a concentration-dependent manner, with Eucalyptus the most potent antioxidant. Toxicity of plant extracts to neuronal cells was concentration dependent, with Eucalyptus also the most toxic extract. Fractionation of plant extracts and analysis by mass spectrometry identified a number of plant polyphenols that might have contributed to the cholinesterase inhibition: 3-caffeoylquinic acid, methyl 4-caffeoylquinate, kaempferol-acetyl-glycoside, quercetin 3-rutinoside, quercetin-acetyl-glycoside, kaempferol 3-<i>O</i>-glucoside, and quercetin 3-<i>O</i>-glucoside. In silico molecular modeling of these polyphenols demonstrated their improved AChE and BuChE binding affinities compared to the current FDA-approved dual ChEI, galantamine. Collectively, all the plant extracts contained nutraceutical agents as antioxidants and ChEIs and, therefore, their chronic consumption may prove beneficial to combat the pathological deficits that accrue in Alzheimer disease."
