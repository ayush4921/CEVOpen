    "<h4>Background</h4>Mosquitoes are blood sucking arthropods and serve as vectors of many diseases causing serious health problems to human beings. <i>Culex quinquefasciatus</i> and <i>Aedes aegypti</i> were responsible for Filariasis and Dengue. Synthetic pesticides were effective against mosquitoes as well as main sources of environmental pollution and most of them are immunosuppressant. Botanicals were widely used as insecticides, growth disruptors, repellents, etc. The aim of this research was to determine larvicidal properties of powdered leaf, <i>Elytraria acaulis</i> against late third or early fourth in-star larvae of <i>Cx. quinquefasciatus</i> and <i>Ae. aegypti</i>.<h4>Methods</h4>Larvae of <i>Cx. quinquefasciatus</i> and <i>Ae. aegypti</i> were tested at various concentrations of 100, 120, 140, 160, 180 and 200mg/100ml and mortality was recorded after 24h. The LC<sub>50</sub> values of the <i>E. acaulis</i> leaf powder were calculated by Probit analysis.<h4>Results</h4>The plant powder exhibited strong larvicidal activity against <i>Cx. quinquefasciatus</i> with LC<sub>50</sub> value of 116.07mg/100ml against <i>Ae. aegypti</i> 124.25mg/100ml respectively. The result indicated that the plant powder of <i>E. acaulis</i> showed potential larvicidal activity against <i>Cx</i>. <i>quinquefasciatus</i> and <i>Ae. aegypti</i>.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The overall findings of the present investigation suggested that the <i>E. acaulis</i> highly effective against <i>Cx. quinquefasciatus</i> and <i>Ae. aegypti</i> larvae. <i>Elytraria acaulis</i> may be used as an alternative to synthetic chemical pesticides for control of vectors to reduce vector borne diseases and did not harm to total environment."
