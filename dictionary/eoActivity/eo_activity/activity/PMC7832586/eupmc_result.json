    "Morels (<i>Morchella</i> spp.) are valuable medicinal and edible mushrooms. In this study, chemical profiles of aromas and lipophilic extracts of black morel (<i>Morchella importuna</i>) grown in China were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy, along with the evaluation of antioxidant and antimicrobial activities for the lipophilic extracts. Sixty-five compounds in total were identified from the aromas, and 1-octen-3-ol was the main component for aromas of fresh (34.40%) and freeze-dried (68.61%) black morels, while the most abundant compound for the aroma of the oven-dried sample was 2(5<i>H</i>)-furanone (13.95%). From the lipophilic extracts, 29 compounds were identified with linoleic acid as the main compound for fresh (77.37%) and freeze-dried (56.46%) black morels and steroids (92.41%) as the main constituent for an oven-dried sample. All three lipophilic extracts showed moderate antioxidant activities against 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) with the IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging 7.56 ∼ 17.52 mg/mL and 5.75 ∼ 9.73 mg/mL, respectively, and no obvious antimicrobial activity was observed for lipophilic extracts. The drying methods affect the chemical profile of black morel, and freeze-drying was favorable for retaining nutrients and morel smell. This is the first report on the aroma and lipophilic extracts of <i>M. importuna</i> grown in China."
