    "<h4>Aim</h4>The search for alternative therapies for oral candidiasis is a necessity and the use of medicinal plants seems to be one such promising solutions. Incorporation of phytotherapeutic agents, <i>Azadirachta indica</i> (neem oil), <i>Melaleuca alternifolia</i> oil (tea tree oil), and <i>Cocos nucifera</i> oil (coconut oil), were tested for their efficacy as antifungal agents against <i>Candida albicans</i>. Next, the efficacy of these three antifungal agents when incorporated in a soft relining material at minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was evaluated.<h4>Settings and design</h4>Evaluative - <i>In-vitro</i> study design.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>The MIC against <i>C. albicans</i> ATCC 24433 was calculated for <i>M. alternifolia</i> oil, <i>A. indica</i> oil, and <i>C. nucifera</i> oil using the broth microdilution method. Based on the preliminary screening results for MIC, tissue conditioner samples were prepared to evaluate the zone of inhibition (ZOI) and MIC. Antifungal activity of the MIC of the three oils was assessed and compared by measuring the mean ZOI. Antifungal activity of the three oils was assessed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and <i>post hoc</i> test.<h4>Statistical analysis used</h4>Oneway ANOVA and post hoc Tukey honestly significant difference test.<h4>Results</h4>Inhibition against <i>C. albicans</i> was exhibited when 20% v/v, 25% v/v, and 15% v/v of <i>C. nucifera</i> oil, <i>M. alternifolia</i> oil, and <i>A. indica</i> oil were used, respectively. The results of ANOVA and <i>post hoc</i> test at the end of 48 h and 7 days suggested that all three oils were significantly different from each other (<i>P</i> = 0.000) and <i>A. indica</i>/neem oil with 15% concentration had the best antifungal activity at the end of 48 h and 7 days.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The antimycotic activity of <i>M. alternifolia</i>, <i>C. nucifera</i>, and <i>A. indica</i> mixed with the Visco-gel tissue conditioner can be used as an alternative therapy for denture stomatitis."
