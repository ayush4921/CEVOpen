Moreover, the emergence of malaria parasite resistance to antimalarial drugs has prompted the search for new, effective, and safe antimalarial agents. For this reason, the study of medicinal plants in discovering new antimalarial drugs is important and remains a crucial step in the fight against malaria. Hence, this study is aimed at investigating the antimalarial activity of <italic>Gymnema inodorum</italic> leaf extract (GIE) in <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> infected mice. Aqueous crude extract of <italic>G. inodorum</italic> leaves was prepared in distilled water (DW) and acute toxicity in mice was carried out. The antimalarial activity was assessed in the five groups of ICR mice employing the 4-day suppressive and curative tests. Untreated and positive controls were given DW along with 10&#x02009;mg/kg of chloroquine, respectively. Any signs of toxicity, behavioral changes, and mortality were not observed in mice given GIE up to 5,000&#x02009;mg/kg. GIE significantly (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) suppressed parasitemia by 25.65%, 38.12%, and 58.28% at 10, 50, and 100&#x02009;mg/kg, respectively, in the 4-day suppressive test. In the curative test, the highest parasitemia inhibition of 66.78% was observed at 100&#x02009;mg/kg of GIE. Moreover, GIE prevented packed cell volume reduction and body weight loss compared to the untreated control. Additionally, GIE was able to prolong the mean survival time of infected mice significantly. The results obtained in this study confirmed the safety and promise of <italic>G. inodorum</italic> as an important source of new antimalarial agents and justify its folkloric use for malaria treatment.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Chiang Mai University</funding-source></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Though malaria mortality rates have reduced steadily over the period 2000&#x02013;2018, about 229 million cases and 409,000 deaths in 2019 showing that malaria is still a serious infectious disease with 95% of the cases and deaths occurring in Africa, especially in children under five years of age [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Malaria is caused by <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites transmitted by the female <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquito. Although an effective vaccine is the best control for malaria, there is no commercially available malarial vaccine, and it is still ongoing currently [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The strategy for malaria and case management have largely relied and mainly focus on antimalarial drugs [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, the emergence of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasite resistance to currently available antimalarial drugs such as amodiaquine, mefloquine, quinine, chloroquine, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, and artemisinin derivatives has been reported [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Therefore, searching for new and novel antimalarial compounds that are safe, effective, and affordable are urgently needed. The great significance of plant-derived antimalarial drugs is highlighted by quinine (derived from Cinchona tree) and artemisinin (derived from <italic>Artemisia annua</italic>). In this respect, plant resources play a crucial role as a potential target for new antimalarial drugs. World Health Organization estimated that about 80% of malaria endemic countries rely on traditional medicines to treat the disease. However, scientific reports to validate the antimalarial properties of these traditional remedies are not yet fully explored [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>
<italic>Gymnema sylvestre</italic>, belonging to family Asclepiadaceae, is found in tropical and subtropical regions in central and southern India, southern part of China, Africa, Malaysia, and Sri Lanka [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It has been one of the major botanicals used in Ayurvedic medicine to treat disease conditions ranging from diabetes, malaria, to snakebites [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. <italic>In vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> investigation <italic>G. sylvestre</italic> revealed the pharmacological potentials including antidiabetic and hypoglycemic, antihyperlipidemic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiarthritic, anticancer, antimicrobial, hepatoprotective, cardioprotective, and immunosuppressive activities [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These actions are attributed to the therapeutically essential families of compounds, including polyphenols, flavonoids, kaempferol, quinones, anthraquinones, tannins, triterpenoid saponins, and gymnemic acids [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. <italic>Gymnema inodorum</italic> (Lour.) Decne (Thai name: Phak Chiang Da), belonging to the same group as <italic>G. sylvestre</italic>, is found mostly in South-Eastern Asia, including Thailand, especially in the Northern and Eastern parts of the country [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. <italic>G. inodorum</italic> extract has been shown to have an ability to inhibit glucose absorption as well as potent antioxidant activity with polyphenols, flavonoids, and gymnemic acids as the major compounds [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The plant is endowed with active compounds such as polyphenols, flavonoids, terpenoids, and saponin, with reported antioxidant and antimalarial activities [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Therefore, this also justified the present study. Considering all the above since no previous study for antimalarial effect of <italic>G. inodorum</italic> is found essential, hence, this study was designed to evaluate <italic>G. inodorum</italic> leaf extract's antimalarial activity against <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> infection in mice.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2.

Discussion</title><p>The antimalarial activity of <italic>G. inodorum</italic> leaf extract against <italic>P. berghei</italic> infected mice in chemosuppressive and curative models was reported. Oral administration of GIE did not cause mortality or any sign of behavioral changes until the end of 14 days up to a dose of 5,000&#x02009;mg/kg. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) guideline of acute toxicity assay, if LD<sub>50</sub> of the GIE (&#x0003e;5,000&#x02009;mg/kg) was found to be three times the minimum effective dose (50 and 100&#x02009;mg/kg), it was taken as a good candidate for further studies [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This could justify the routine use of GIE in the traditional management of malaria and other ailments.</p><p>The antimalarial activities of the GIE were investigated using the standard models. The <italic>in vivo</italic> models using rodent malaria have been validated by identifying standard antimalarial drugs, including CQ, pyrimethamine, and artemisinin derivatives [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It is also cost-effective in conducting the pharmacological screening in rodent models than in primate models. Accordingly, the GIE showed dose-dependent inhibition of parasitemia with significant. A compound is considered active when the inhibition in parasitemia is &#x02265;30%, which is in agreement and supports the finding of this study [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Hence, GIE can be considered to be active in its schizontocidal activity against PbANKA infected mice. The antimalarial activity of the crude plant extracts is due to bioactive compounds, such as polyphenols, flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, and saponin. Therefore, the antimalarial activity of GIE could have resulted from the single or combined action of the above compounds [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The possible actions of antimalarial activity might be through the antioxidant, immunomodulatory, intercalation in DNA, blocking of protein synthesis, inhibition of erythrocyte invasion by parasites, disruption of hemozoin formation, or by other unknown mechanisms [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, the lower dose (10&#x02009;mg/kg) of GIE may be considered to have lower antimalarial activity. This could be due to the presence of active compounds at low levels in the GIE.</p><p>The PCV reduction is one feature of both human and rodent malaria infection. PbANKA infected mice suffer from hemolysis and severe anemia because of rapid destruction and clearance of erythrocytes by increased parasitemia [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Moreover, PbANKA infection also increased erythrocyte fragility, erythropoietic suppression, and dyserythropoiesis [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Plant extracts with antimalarial activity are expected to prevent PCV reduction and hemolysis. It was noted that the effective prevention of PCV reduction in the GIE treated groups at the doses of 50 and 100&#x02009;mg/kg might indicate the protective role of this extract. This might result from the antioxidant and antimalarial effects of the GIE against PbANKA infected erythrocytes. Loss of BW is another manifestation of rodent malaria infection in mice. This might be due to disturbed metabolic function, catabolic activity on lipids, anorexigenic effect, appetite depressive action, and malaria-associated hypoglycemia [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Infected mice treated with 50 and 100&#x02009;mg/kg of GIE showed the protection of BW loss; hence, this might tell us about the antimalarial activity of the extract. Moreover, appetite-stimulating activity and the function of vitamin B such as B1, B2, and B3 might also be considered [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, 10&#x02009;mg/kg of GIE was not strong enough to significantly prevent PCV reduction and BW loss. It could be due to the low level of active compounds associated with the extract.</p><p>The antimalarial effect of GIE on an established infection of PbANKA in mice was carried out. GIE at all doses presented a significant dose-dependent curative effect. This might be an indication that GIE had effective antimalarial activity in the late stage of infection. The percentage of inhibition of the curative test was found to be high compared to the chemosuppressive test. This might be due to the stage-specific action of active compounds presented in GIE. On the other hand, MST is also an important parameter to evaluate the antimalarial activity of the extract [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. A plant extract that can prolong MST of infected mice compared to untreated control is considered active. Our results showed that GIE at all doses, compared to untreated control, had significantly prolonged MST, which was directly linked to parasitemia inhibition in both tested models.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusion</title><p>Acute toxicity assay conducted on GIE confirmed the safety of this plant up to 5,000&#x02009;mg/kg. The present study's findings indicated that GIE exerted significant chemosuppressive and curative antimalarial activities against PbANKA. The highest antimalarial effect was exhibited at the highest dose tested. The decline in parasitemia, protecting PCV reduction, BW recovery, and prolonged MST in the treated mice justifies the folkloric use of GIE in the malaria treatment. Consequently, the GIE could be used as potential source to develop an alternative antimalarial drug.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors wish to thank the students from the School of Allied Health Sciences, Walailak University, for their technical support.
