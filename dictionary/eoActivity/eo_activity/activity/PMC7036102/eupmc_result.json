    "The chemical constituents and the antioxidant, antimicrobial, and cytotoxic activities of fresh rhizome essential oil (FR-EO) and dry rhizome essential oil (DR-EO) of Zingiber zerumbet (L.) Smith obtained from Southwest China were compared. Zerumbone was the predominant component in both FR-EO and DR-EO (75.0% and 41.9%, respectively). FR-EO, DR-EO, and zerumbone were all demonstrated to have significant antimicrobial capacity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, and Proteus vulgaris, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranging from 31.25 to 156.25 μg/mL and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) ranging from 62.50 to 625.00 μg/mL. Zerumbone showed the strongest antimicrobial potential against all tested microorganisms compared with the fresh and dry rhizome essential oils. FR-EO was found to be more active than DR-EO against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, and Proteus vulgaris. FR-EO, DR-EO, and zerumbone all showed significant cytotoxic activity against K562, PC-3, and A549 human tumor cell lines in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Zerumbone exhibited the strongest antiproliferative activity against all tested human tumor cell lines with an IC50 of 4.21-11.09 μg/mL for 72 h incubation, as compared with the fresh and dry rhizome oils. The cytotoxic activity of FR-EO (IC50: 10.48-14.51 μg/mL for 72 h) was found to be significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that of DR-EO (IC50: 13.83-33.24 μg/mL for 72 h). FR-EO, DR-EO, and zerumbone exhibited selective cytotoxic activity to tumor cells, with a significantly low cytotoxicity to normal cells (MRC-5, IC50: 56.98-147.29 μg/mL). However, FR-EO, DR-EO, and zerumbone all exhibited weak free-radical-scavenging activity according to DPPH and ABTS analysis. The findings highlighted in this study show that FR-EO provides appreciably higher content of the bioactive compound, zerumbone, and has higher antimicrobial and cytotoxic properties than DR-EO. Thus, fresh Z. zerumbet rhizome should be preferred in cosmetic, food, and pharmaceutical applications."
