Presently, limited treatment modalities with symptomatic approach are available for alleviating fatty liver. Traditional and herbal treatment modalities have shown evidence to improve the disease pathology. In the present research work, evaluation of a selected medicinal plant <italic>Lysimachia candida</italic> Lindl. was carried out to investigate its beneficial effects on fatty liver disease in rats. Male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were fed with high-fat high-fructose diet to induce fatty liver phenotypes. After induction for 15&#x000a0;weeks, methanolic extract of <italic>Lysimachia candida</italic> Lindl. (250&#x000a0;mg/kg b. w. p. o.) was administrated to the rats daily for the next 17&#x000a0;weeks. Blood samples were collected at different time points to analyze fasting blood glucose levels and relevant biochemical parameters important for the assessment of metabolic disease phenotypes. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based metabolomics was done to study the dynamics of metabolic changes in the serum during disease progression and how the medicinally important plant extract treatment reversed the metabolic diseases. Multivariate data analysis approaches have been employed to understand the metabolome changes and disease pathology. This study has identified the interplay of some metabolic pathways that alter the disease progression and their reversal after administration of the plant extract. Different group of metabolites mainly bile acids, fatty acids, carnitines, and their derivatives were found to be altered in the diseased rats. However, all the metabolites identified between control and disease groups are mainly related to lipid metabolism. The results depict that the treatment with the above-mentioned plant extract improves the regulation of aberrant lipid metabolism, and reverses the metabolic syndrome phenotype. Therefore, the present study reveals the potential mechanism of the herbal extract to prevent metabolic syndrome in rats.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>animal model</kwd><kwd>herbal extract</kwd><kwd>LC-MS/MS</kwd><kwd>bile acids</kwd><kwd>fatty acids</kwd><kwd>PPAR&#x003b1;</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The condition in which surplus lipids accumulate in the hepatocytes is known as fatty liver or hepatic steatosis (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Allison, 2004</xref>). Accumulation of more than 5% lipids in hepatocytes is known as hepatic steatosis as the human liver does not have much capacity to store lipids (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Alcohol, chronic hepatitis C, Wilson&#x02019;s disease, abetalipoproteinemia, and porphyria cutanea tarda are mostly found to be associated with hepatic steatosis. Medications like steroids, tamoxifen, and amiodarone are found to precipitate hepatic steatosis (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Allison, 2004</xref>). Fatty liver disease can be categorized into two main types: non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD) (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al., 2017</xref>). NAFLD is a chronic and progressive disease starting from non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) to hepatic cirrhosis and ultimately leading to hepatocellular carcinoma (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Sarkar et al., 2020</xref>). As per recent prevalence status, 20&#x02013;46% of the world population has been stated to suffer from NAFLD (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2018</xref>) with 15&#x02013;40% patients in the western countries and 9&#x02013;40% in Asian countries (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Amarapurkar et al., 2007</xref>). There are no particular clinical symptoms of NAFLD other than discomfort in the right upper quadrant and fatigue. Some other signs include hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, spider naevi, and palmar erythema, although in most cases, the disease is asymptomatic with no signs of clinical manifestation (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Allison, 2004</xref>).</p><p>NAFL is initiated by the deposition of small lipid droplets in hepatocytes, and overtime accumulation of these lipid droplets triggers lipotoxicity. The circulating cytokines together with elevated hepatic reactive oxygen species induce lobular inflammation, which results in the typical characteristic feature of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) called hepatocellular ballooning. At advanced stages, the replacement of hepatic tissue with collagen results in the development of fibrotic scar tissues and leads to hepatic cirrhosis and ultimately hepatocellular carcinoma (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Rinella, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Carr et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Foulds et al., 2017</xref>). The histopathological features of NAFLD are similar to alcoholic hepatic damage. Despite extensive research in understanding the pathophysiology of fatty liver diseases, there are still no targeted treatments available till date. The current treatment modalities for AFLD are identical to what it was 50&#x000a0;years ago i.e., abstinence, nutritional support, and corticosteroids (or pentoxifylline unless steroids are contraindicated). Whereas those for NAFLD include weight loss and co-morbidity management (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>There are several evidences where traditional or herbal remedies are found to be useful in ameliorating several pathological features of fatty liver (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et al., 2013</xref>). Based on the evidence to practice in North-east part of India by local people, we have selected a plant known as <italic>Lysimachia candida</italic> Lindl. belonging to the family <italic>Primulaceae</italic> (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2012</xref>)<italic>.</italic> The plant is native to the north-east region of India and mainly found in Assam and Manipur states. It is commonly known as loosestrife or kengoi in Manipuri. It is reported to have some pharmacological activity such as ailment of fever, swelling, fracture of bone, dermatitis, and antifungal activity (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Xia et al., 2013</xref>). This plant has not been explored for its pharmacological effects on fatty liver disease. We have chosen this plant to explore its beneficial effect on fatty liver and validate this plant in the context of its therapeutic effects.</p><p>We have demonstrated that feeding high-fat high-fructose (HFHF) diet to Sprague Dawley (SD) rats over a period of 32&#x000a0;weeks not only induces fatty liver phenotypes such as biochemical and histopathological changes but also differentially regulates the level of several metabolites such as bile acids, unsaturated fatty acids and other metabolites involved in inflammation and homeostasis. Therefore, using the untargeted metabolomics approach, the metabolomic profile of rat serum from all three groups were used to identify the different metabolites involved in disease development and how the reversal of disease happens after the intervention of treatment. We identified various metabolites with the help of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and both the enrichment and the pathway analyses demonstrated that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha is a central pathway through which <italic>Lysimachia candida</italic> Lindl. extract may show a beneficial effect on fatty liver.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Plant Collection and Identification of Bioactive Compounds</title><p>The whole plant <italic>Lysamachia candida</italic> Lindl. were collected from Moirang Kampu, Manipur (Latitude: 25&#x000b0;5&#x02019;31.995&#x0201d;N to 24&#x000b0;39&#x02019;45.25&#x0201d;N; Longitude: 94&#x000b0;8&#x02019;49.324&#x0201d;E to 93&#x000b0;53&#x02019;47.559&#x0201d;E) in June and July 2017. The Botanical Survey of India, Eastern Regional Centre, Shillong, Meghalaya authenticated the plant (Accession No. 95588). The <italic>Lysimachia candida</italic> Lindl. plant was air-dried for 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;weeks and then pulverized to a fine powder by the electric grinder. Exhaustive extraction was performed in a Soxhlet apparatus for 11&#x000a0;h using methanol (Merck) as a solvent. After which, the extract was concentrated under reduced vacuum pressure at 40&#x000b0;C in a rotary vacuum evaporator. The concentrated extracts were further lyophilized using Eyela Freeze Dryer (FDU-506, United States). 1&#x000a0;kg of fresh plant material yielded 100&#x000a0;g of dry powder losing 90% of moisture content and from extraction 1&#x000a0;kg plant material using methanol as solvent yielded 80&#x000a0;gm of dry extract. The final yield of methanolic extract was 8% w/w. Finally, the lyophilized extract was tested for residual methanol present using GC-MS and stored in a sterile container and placed at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C until further use. The stored lyophilized extract did not show the presence of any methanol. The extract was reconstituted in 100% methanol to identify bioactive compounds in LC-MS and LC-MSMS. The Orbitrap Fusion Mass Spectrometer was used to acquire data that is fitted with heated electrospray ionization (HESI) source. Both the negative and positive ions were scanned at 120,000 resolution in the MS1 mode and 30,000 resolution in the data-dependent MS2 scan mode. The spray voltage of 4,000 and 35,000&#x000a0;V were set for positive and negative modes, respectively. Auxiliary gas and Sheath gas were used and set to 11 and 42, respectively. The Mass scan analyzer was set to scan in the range of 50&#x02013;1,000&#x000a0;m/z. For MS we have used an automatic gain control target of 200,000 ions with maximum injection time at 80&#x000a0;ms and 20,000 ions were used as an automatic gain control target at a maximum injection time of 60&#x000a0;ms for MSMS analysis. The methanolic extract was separated using HSS T3 column (100 &#x000d7; 2:1&#x000a0;mm i. d. 1.7&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m, Waters) in &#x0201c;UPLC Ultimate 3,000&#x0201d; and the temperature was maintained at 40&#x000b0;C. Mobile phase A containing water with 0.1% formic acid and acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid was used in mobile phase B. The elution conditions were followed as 0&#x000a0;min, 1% B; 1&#x000a0;min, 15% B; 4&#x000a0;min, 35% B; 7&#x000a0;min, 95% B; 9&#x000a0;min, 95% B; 10&#x000a0;min, 1% B; and 14&#x000a0;min, 1% B with flow rate of 0.3&#x000a0;ml/min and 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l sample was injected. The data has been processed using Progenesis QI software with an untargeted approach. We have used different libraries of natural products i. e., spectral data matching with mzCloud and MassBank, Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking (GNPS) for metabolite identification and in-house developed library of compounds based on purchase authentic metabolites standards and predicting the retention time of metabolites not available with us. Metabolites were confirmed through accurate mass, MS/MS fragmentation and retention time matching.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Animals</title><p>To evaluate the potential effect of <italic>Lysimachia candida</italic> Lindl. on fatty liver, male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were fed with high-fat high-fructose (HFHF) diet for 32&#x000a0;weeks.

All studies were carried out using six rats (<italic>n</italic> = 6) in each group. In the control group, the rats were fed with a normal chow diet for 32&#x000a0;weeks. At starting rats from the other two groups were fed with a high-fat high-fructose diet (Catalog no. D16030909, Research Diet, Inc. United States) for 15&#x000a0;weeks. After 15&#x000a0;weeks, the animals were selected and randomized into two groups viz., vehicle control (HFHF) and test group (Treatment), based on their fasting blood glucose level. The dose was selected based on efficacy study, LD50 was measured and it is found that dose is safe until 2.5&#x000a0;gm/kg oral dose. We chose one tenth of the dose as efficacy dose. 0.3% CMC vehicle and the plant extract (250&#x000a0;mg/kg/day) in the same vehicle were administered via oral gavage to the HFHF group and treatment group respectively, for 17&#x000a0;weeks along with HFHF diet. At the end of the study, the blood samples were collected in 2&#x000a0;ml ependroff tubes from the retro-orbital sinus for serum isolation.

To maximize the coverage of different classes of metabolites and to identify the different classes of metabolites, we have run the rat serum on reverse phase and hydrophilic column. We have identified a total of 155 metabolites in serum samples after combining data from the positive and negative modes (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s10">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Principal component analysis (PCA) has clearly indicated a good separation between the control and HFHF rat serum metabolome. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, principal component 1 explains 24% of data and principal component 2 explains 17.6% of the data. The third component explains another 10.9% of the data, then fourth and fifth components explain 7.2 and 4.6% of data respectively. Total variation explained by all the five components is 64.3%. Further, we did a clustering analysis of data to visualize the different metabolites in more detail. Comparison among control, HFHF, and treatment have been done by ANOVA and significantly altered metabolites have been shown in the heatmap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Comparison between control and HFHF rat serum metabolites using clustering indicated the change in bile acids, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acid, carnitines, and other metabolites involved in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Interestingly, the expression of these metabolites has been found to be reversed in the Treatment group.

It includes a spectrum of liver disease ranging from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), advanced fibrosis, and rarely, progression to cirrhosis. NAFLD is associated with several diseases like obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bedogni et al., 2005</xref>). It has been shown that NAFLD is strongly associated with the features of metabolic syndrome. Insulin resistance is a key pathogenic factor in both NAFLD and metabolic syndrome. Data from experimental and clinical studies indicate that NAFLD may be the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Marchesini et al., 2001</xref>). There are no drugs i.e., small molecules approved by the FDA to treat NAFLD or NASH. However, few pharmacological modalities have been practiced to ease the associated co-morbidities. Considering the presence of several active biomolecules in herbs and their well-proven role in health and disease, further research is necessary to confirm the therapeutic role of herbs in patient with NAFLD. Few herbal preparations have already found to be beneficial in ameliorating several pathological features of fatty liver (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Hong et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bose et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Chidambaram et al., 2010</xref>). Here, in the present study, we have selected the plant <italic>Lysimachia candida</italic> Lindl. widely used by the native population of the northeastern region to cure different metabolic disease, to explore its potential role in preventing HFHF-induced fatty liver in SD rats.</p><p>Previously, we and others showed that chronic feeding of high-fat high-fructose diet causes increase in body weight, insulin resistance, and hyperglycemia (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Nizami et al., 2019</xref>). In the present study, we have observed a remarkable increase in body weight in the HFHF group indicating obesity in rats. However, reduction in body weight was observed in high-fat high-fructose diet-fed rats after treatment with methanolic extract of <italic>Lysimachia candida</italic>, with not much change in its timeline. Similarly, fasting blood glucose (FBG) level was found to be decreased in the treatment group. The data clearly demonstrate that the methanolic extract of <italic>Lysimachia candida</italic> Lindl. was able to control the FBG levels in the treatment group. The IPGTT curve and its area under the curve reveals that there is an increase in insulin resistance in HFHF group. High levels of insulin were also observed in the HFHF group contrary to the Control group. Insulin resistance in the HFHF was confirmed by the increase in the HOMA IR whereas the treatment with methanolic extract of <italic>Lysimachia candida</italic> Lindl. alleviated the HOMA IR near to the Control, suggesting its potential activity to combat insulin resistance. To check the lipid levels, we measured the TG and FFAs in both serum and hepatic tissue. We found that the serum and hepatic triglyceride levels were increased in the HFHF group while TG levels decreased in the Treatment group when compared with Control. Hence, again the methanolic extract of <italic>Lysimachia candida</italic> Lindl. was successfully able to normalize the TG levels in both serum and liver. Similarly, high levels of hepatic FFAs were observed in the HFHF group, which was decreased after treatment. Therefore, the methanolic extract of <italic>Lysimachia candida</italic> Lindl. is capable of reversing and managing body weight changes, FBG, insulin resistance, TG, and FFA levels.</p><p>Histology analysis confirmed the development of fatty liver with early fibrosis. Since Oil-O-Red specifically stains triglycerides together with cholesterol ester, this stain represents the real representation of lipid accumulation (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Sarkar et al., 2020</xref>). We have observed a high level of lipid deposition in the HFHF group. However, the methanolic extract of <italic>Lysimachia candida</italic> Lindl. administration reduced the fat accumulation similar to the control group. Liver samples from the HFHF group exhibited prominent steatosis, ballooning, and lobular inflammation with mild fibrosis, while the Treatment group unveiled reduced levels of steatohepatitis with no fibrosis. Overall, the histopathology study confirmed the presence of hepatic steatosis, ballooning, lobular inflammation, and perisinusoidal fibrosis in the disease group, which was alleviated in the treatment group.</p><p>After confirming the fatty liver phenotype, we wanted to correlate the phenotypic changes in HFHF rats with serum metabolic profiles. The untargeted metabolomic analysis with multivariate data analysis (Principal component analysis) and clustering revealed a clear separation of rat serum metabolome between Control and HFHF groups. Principal component analysis clearly indicates the difference in metabolome in HFHF as compared to control at different time points. Clustering analysis also indicates change in levels of different metabolites in the control and HFHF group. Pathway enrichment analysis of different metabolites suggests a change in linoleic acid metabolism, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and primary bile acid biosynthesis pathway. Hence, we could infer from our result that high-fat high-fructose diet has altered various metabolites from the normal physiological level. Changes in bile acids, unsaturated fatty acids, carnitines, and other metabolites involved in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) pathways were found in HFHF animals. Interestingly, the altered levels of these metabolites have been found to be reversed in the treatment group. PPAR alpha and PPAR gamma are highly expressed in the liver and play a significant role in the synthesis of bile acid and fatty acid uptake (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Mandard et al., 2004</xref>). Oxidation of fatty acid and expression of fatty acid transport protein shares a close relationship with nuclear receptor PPAR&#x003b1; and PPAR&#x003b3; in liver steatosis (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Pyper et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The serum metabolites such as (+/-)8-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid ((+/-)8-HEPE)), pentadecanoic acid, heptadecanoate were downregulated in the HFHF group and interestingly, plant extract treatment has reversed their expression. (+/-) 8-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid acts as a ligand of PPAR (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Forman et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Yamada et al., 2014</xref>). For the first time, Yamada et al. demonstrated that orally administered 8-HEPE can activate PPAR&#x003b1;, resulting in the decrease of plasma and hepatic TG levels (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Yamada et al., 2016</xref>). As stated, 8-HEPE is a stimulator of PPAR&#x003b1;, hence decrease levels of 8-HEPE can reduce the activation of PPAR&#x003b1; and increase the serum and hepatic TG levels as we observed in the HFHF group. However, the methanolic extract of <italic>Lysimachia candida</italic> Lindl. administration increased the serum 8-HEPE levels similar to the control group. Two fatty acids, pentadecanoic acid (C15) and heptadecanoic acid (C17) were reduced in HFHF group. Epidemiological researches have revealed that plasma concentrations of odd chain saturated fatty acids like pentadecanoic acid and heptadecanoic acid are related to reduced risks for metabolic disorders like type II diabetes and coronary heart disease (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Jenkins et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, the treatment with methanolic extract of <italic>Lysimachia candida</italic> Lindl. was able to upregulate these odd chain saturated fatty acids levels similar to Control.</p><p>Bile acids play a crucial role in maintaining the level of both free and conjugated forms of bile acids in the peripheral circulation. In hepatic disease, levels of bile acids are aberrated especially in synthesis, excretion, and reabsorption of bile acids, which raises the level of total bile acids. Some studies have demonstrated the effect of liver injury on bile acid metabolism (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Beyo&#x0011f;lu and Idle, 2013</xref>). A previous study reported that the levels of bile acid were found to be low in carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) induced fatty liver rats (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). When there is a disruption in the bile acid metabolism, it leads to a decrease in the activation of nuclear receptors such as FXR (farnesoid X receptor) and dysregulation in these receptors leads to NAFLD (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Pars&#x000e9;us et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). Chenodeoxycholic acid, muricholic acid and other cholic acids are primary bile acids produced in the liver as derivatives of cholesterol and secreted in the intestine as taurine and glycine conjugates. These bile acids interact with FXR and regulate glycemia and other metabolic functions (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Grabherr et al., 2019</xref>). In the present study, we have found that different bile acids such as Muricholic acid, Deoxycholic Acid, Glycocholic acid, Glycochenodeoxycholic Acid, and Glycodeoxycholic acid were lowered in the serum of HFHF rats. However, their serum levels were normalized after the treatment of the methanolic extract of <italic>Lysimachia candida</italic> Lindl. especially after 3&#x000a0;weeks. Lower serum levels of bile acids in the HFHF group may reduce the activation of FXR and enhance the fat accumulation in the rat liver which is similar to NAFLD pathologies. Our findings might be working through similar pathway as evidenced in the study by Sun (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2018</xref>). Bile acids activate mRNA expression of PPAR&#x003b1; via binding of FXR in the PPAR promoter (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Pineda Torra et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, it seems that the FXR-PPAR&#x003b1; pathway might be involved for the attenuation of fatty liver after the treatment of methanolic extract of <italic>Lysimachia candida</italic> Lindl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>)<italic>.</italic>
