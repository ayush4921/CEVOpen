The response to these treatments was mainly assessed by the measuring of edema paw size, hematological and biochemical analysis, oxidative stress testing, and histological study. All the studied seed oils especially prickly pear oil proved to be efficient in treating acute inflammation. The oil-treated groups revealed a significant (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) decrease in the clinical signs of inflammation, hematological parameters (white blood cells and platelets), concentrations of CRP and fibrinogen, and congestion compared to the normal saline-treated group.

Introduction</title><p>The worldwide rise of inflammatory diseases has made them to become a global emergency. The inflammation which underlies almost every disease process has been shown to cause many common diseases. Indeed, inflammation is a protective reaction of the body to harmful stimuli [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Persistent and uncontrolled inflammation leads to the development of several chronic inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and atherosclerosis [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Thus, it behooves researchers to develop effective anti-inflammatory treatments to control acute inflammation using medicinal plants that have been served as a source of effective and safe alternative therapeutic agents for various ailments including inflammation [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Accordingly, the <italic>Cucurbita pepo</italic> (pumpkin), <italic>Linum usitatissimum</italic> (linseed), and <italic>Opuntia ficus indica</italic> (prickly pear), that have prominent extracted seed oils, are studied as a possible anti-inflammatory treatment. The inflammatory process induces oxidative stress and reduces cellular antioxidant capacity [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Thus, the current study aimed at assessing and reporting the &#x0201c;<italic>in vivo</italic>&#x0201d; anti-inflammatory and antioxidative activities of pumpkin, linseed, and prickly pear extracted oils on acute inflammation induced by carrageenan.</p><p>Although antioxidant and antibacterial properties of pumpkin, linseed, and prickly pear oils were reported in several studies [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], the acute anti-inflammatory activities using carrageenan test are still not scientifically confirmed.</p><p>
<italic>Cucurbita pepo</italic> (pumpkin) is an annual climber plant globally well-known [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. According to several reports, pumpkin seeds contain considerable amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids (linoleic acid), monounsaturated acid (oleic acid), phytosterols, and <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-tocopherol with therapeutic values [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>The therapeutic use of pumpkin was described in many traditional medicines. Previous studies showed that pumpkin seeds provided various pharmacological properties. It has been used as a remedy for diabetes and several urological disorders (benign prostatic hyperplasia and micturition problems) [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It was reported that pumpkin seed oil had interesting antioxidant, antibacterial, and wound healing activities [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>
<italic>Linum usitatissimum</italic>, commonly known as linseed or flaxseed, is an annual plant that belongs to the family of Linaceae. Traditionally, flaxseed is grown for its oil. The linseed and its derivative are rich sources of the essential fatty acid (alpha-linolenic acid) and an array of antioxidants [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Linseed extracted oil is used in traditional medicine as an antioxidant, laxative, sedative, and emollient agent [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>
<italic>Opuntia ficus indica</italic> (L.) Mill, known as prickly pear, is a succulent plant that belongs to the cactaceae family. This plant is widespread in dry regions, mainly in the Mediterranean area. Prickly pear seed oil is particularly characterized by a high content of vitamin E, sterols, and fatty acids. The linoleic acid is a major polyunsaturated fatty acid, oleic acid is the dominant monounsaturated fatty acid, and palmitic acid is the major saturated fatty acid [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>It was described that the prickly pear fruit had interesting biological properties, and thus, it was widely used in traditional medicine for its antidiabetic and hypolipidemic properties [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Some authors attributed its possible antioxidant, antibacterial, and wound healing effects to its interesting composition [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Material and Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Material</title><p>The <italic>Opuntia ficus indica</italic> L. plant seeds were harvested (November 2014) in Sbeitla (region of Kasserine, North-central Tunisia). However, the <italic>Cucurbita pepo</italic> L. and brown <italic>Linum usitatissimum</italic> seeds were harvested in November 2014 in Sidi Bouzid and Mehdia regions, respectively.</p><p>The seeds were authenticated by Dr. Hamadi Ben Salah, and the voucher sample was deposited at INRAT. The seeds had been dried according to Omega Tunisie Industry standards. After that, the fixed oil was extracted by the first cold pressure from the dried seeds using a mechanical oil press (SMIR, MUV1 65). The seeds were dropped into a cylinder that contains a rotating screw. This screw grinds and crushes the seeds until the oil is extracted. Small holes in the bottom of the cylinder allow the oil to escape into a collection container. The extracted oils were kept in hermetically sealed opaque glass bottles until their use.</p><p>&#x0201c;Inflocine&#x000ae;&#x0201d;: topical ointment was purchased from the local pharmacy.

<italic>(1) Determination of Protein Markers of Inflammation</italic>. C-reactive protein (CRP) is a specific and reliable biomarker that followed the inflammatory process. It increases in proportion to its intensity [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The reactive protein was measured by a turbidimetric method using an automatic analyzer Architect Ci 4100 &#x000ab;ABOTT.&#x000bb; The CRP is expressed with mg/l.</p><p>
<italic>(2) Fibrinogen Assay of Plasma</italic>. The plasma fibrinogen concentration was determined by the Clauss clotting method [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] measured on the STA&#x000ae; analyzer. The principle test measures the conversion rate of fibrinogen into fibrin in the diluted sample in the presence of an excess of thrombin and records the clotting time. The clotting time is inversely proportional to the level of fibrinogen in the plasma. The fibrinogen level is expressed with g/l plasma.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2.7"><title>2.7.

Histopathological Examination</title><p>The microscopic examination of the skin specimen of group 2 (normal saline-treated group) revealed the presence of interstitial edema; the predominance of inflammatory cells in the deep dermis associated with vascular congestion (hyperemia) and dilated capillaries. However, the skin specimen of the oil-treated groups and the reference group showed a significant decrease in inflammatory cells in the dermis and inside the blood vessels. These inflammatory signs seemed to be less significant in prickly pear oil-treated biopsies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>The carrageenan-induced paw edema in rat is an acute inflammation model widely used for the screening of synthetic or natural anti-inflammatory products [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The acute inflammatory response is a protective mechanism of the body to remove the injurious stimuli that involve local cellular and vascular processes following tissue damage [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>In this respect, this study aims at assessing the anti-inflammatory effect of pumpkin, linseed, and prickly pear extracted oils using the carrageenan-induced paw model compared to a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug &#x0201c;Inflocine&#x000ae;.&#x0201d; As oxidative stress plays a key role in inflammatory processes, the tested oils were assessed for their effect on inflammatory mediators and oxidative stress markers in acute inflammation.</p><p>In comparison to the control group, we noticed that the normal saline-treated group had a significant paw thickness increase which peaked at 3 hours after carrageenan injection. This finding was also described by Umamageswari and Maniyar [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Indeed, carrageenan induced an acute inflammatory reaction typically characterized by vasodilation and tissue swelling. This inflammatory exudate is mainly composed of polymorphonuclear leukocytes [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The acute inflammatory response is actually triggered by the release of mediators such as histamine and serotonin in the first few hours. The latter are related to the release of prostaglandins, proteases, and superoxide radicals. These mediators are responsible for the vasodilation of the vessels, the vascular hyperpermeability, the redness, and the edema [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Three hours after carrageenan injection, the reference group and the oil-treated groups showed a significant reduction in the paw thickness compared to the carrageenan treated group. Indeed, it was reported that the injection of carrageenan induced a peak in COX-2 concentration one hour after the injection. This peak was associated with an increase in the synthesis of prostaglandins involved in the inflammatory process [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This may explain the late effect of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as &#x0201c;Inflocine&#x000ae;&#x0201d; whose effect appeared only after 2 hours. This effect was related to its mode of action which involves the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis induced by COX-1 and COX-2 [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>The inflammatory reaction is coordinated by various mediators that involve cell recruitment to the site of inflammation. This leads to investigating the inflammatory parameters (including CRP and fibrinogen), white blood cells, and blood platelets.</p><p>The plasma concentrations of fibrinogen and CRP were significantly increased in the normal saline-treated group compared to the control group. The CRP and fibrinogen are the protein biomarkers of inflammation that are increased during the acute inflammation [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Indeed, the CRP which has proinflammatory and prothrombotic effects increases the expression of tissue factor and interleukin-6. The acute inflammation was also associated with an increase of white blood cell (WBC) and platelet counts. This leukocytosis was attributed to the increase of leukocyte recruitment and could be directly proportional to the severity of the causative stress condition [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. It was reported that carrageenan stimulated immune functions by the infiltration of WBC into the site of inflammation due to the release of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-I). The latter increased the production of both granulocyte and macrophages colony-stimulating factors [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>The significant decrease of the hematological parameters and the clinical signs in the oil-treated groups as well as in the reference group compared to the control group suggest a potent anti-inflammatory effect of the tested oils. It was reported that the anti-inflammatory drugs depleted the migration of inflammatory cells by inhibiting the release of various chemical mediators [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>The carrageenan injection not only induced significant increase in TBARS concentration and the AOPP concentrations but also resulted in a significant decrease of the activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, GPx). Indeed, the phospholipid bilayer of the cell membrane, which is particularly rich of polyunsaturated fatty acids and proteins, formed a target for free radical attack resulting in an increase in skin TBARS and AOPP concentrations [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The decrease in the activities of the antioxidant enzymes such as SOD, CAT, and GPx might be due to their excessive secondary consumption of free radicals which were generated by inflammation. Previous researches revealed that carrageenan injection caused excessive production of free radical. The involvement of oxidative stress in the acute inflammatory process had been already described by several authors [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The tested oils', once in contact with the skin, lipophilic compounds (tocopherols, sterols, and polyunsaturated fatty acids) seeped into the stratum corneum by percutaneous intercellular absorption and then joined the epidermis and the dermis [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The latter was rich in dilated blood vessels which allowed the absorption of bioactive compounds from the oil [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The anti-inflammatory effect of the tested oils based on the clinical and biological assessments could be related to their unsaturated fatty acids which were considered as highly active anti-inflammatory compounds acting as inhibitors of cyclo-oxygenases [<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This effect could be also attributed to the antioxidant properties of the tested oils for their bioactive compounds such as phytosterols, tocopherols, polyphenols, and carotenoids. In fact, the lipophilic aspect of these compounds allowed them to diffuse inside the cell membrane which is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids and protein. Then, these bioactive compounds might trap the activated oxygen species; as a consequence, the spread of both lipid and protein oxidations might be inhibited. Added to that, it was described that phytosterols, in particular <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-sitosterols, and polyphenols had also anti-inflammatory activities [<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>The prickly pear oil provided a better anti-inflammatory effect compared to all the tested oil. This result was closely correlated with its chemical profile, which exhibited a richness in the tocopherols and sterols [<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>Overall, the data of the current study highlight the anti-inflammatory effect of pumpkin, linseed, and especially prickly pear extracted oils on acute inflammation through the decrease of clinical signs of inflammation, infiltration of inflammatory cells, vascular congestion, and biochemical markers. These anti-inflammatory effects elicited by the tested oils are closely associated with the amelioration of the endogenous skin antioxidant status. Thus, the tested oils may be potentially used as an anti-inflammatory component of new drugs for the treatment of acute inflammation without side effects. However, further studies are necessary to determine the cytokine profile and the lipid mediators of the oil-treated groups.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This research was supported by the Tunisian Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research.</p></ack><sec sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data Availability</title><p>No data were used to support this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest.</p></sec><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Deng</surname><given-names>H.</given-names></name><name><surname>Cui</surname><given-names>H.</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Inflammatory responses and inflammation-associated diseases in organs</article-title><source><italic toggle="yes">Oncotarget</italic></source><year>2018</year><volume>9</volume><issue>6</issue><fpage>7204</fpage><lpage>7218</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.18632/oncotarget.23208</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="other">2-s2.0-85040931887</pub-id><?supplied-pmid 29467962?><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">29467962</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bennett</surname><given-names>J.
