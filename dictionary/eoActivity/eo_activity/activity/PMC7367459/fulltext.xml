It has holometabolic development, with egg, larva, pupa and adult phases. Because it is a mosquito highly adapted to the urban environment, its most common breeding sites are artificial containers that accumulate water, such as bottles, tires, cans, and pots [<xref rid="pone.0235740.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Among the control policies adopted in Brazil, the mechanical control is carried out by ACE (Agents to Combat Endemics), with the participation of the population, aiming at the protection, destruction or adequate allocation of potent breeding sites. The intensive collaboration of the population is crucial to hinder the proliferation and installation of the mosquito. In addition, it reinforces the need for adequate sanitary conditions in the cities, eliminating stocks of water that allow eggs to hatch. An important strategy is the promotion of educational actions during home visits made regularly by the health agents [<xref rid="pone.0235740.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>The spread and flow of various serotypes of the dengue virus over the years also have a significant influence on epidemics, as well as an increase in cases diagnosed for the most severe form of the disease. These factors demonstrate the importance of introducing preventive measures in order to reduce dengue rates [<xref rid="pone.0235740.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>To combat these disease vectors, insecticides are the most used products, but they have several disadvantages, as they can be the source of several environmental problems [<xref rid="pone.0235740.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0235740.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

Results: The authors give lethal doses; however, if they want to find correct and relevant values, they should use the probit analysis and compare the CI95 intervals. Only in this way can they claim that a significant difference or progression in efficacy in time has been achieved. The term Positive Control (Table 2) is not correct. This term is used to describe the control variant where a commercial insecticide has been used (to compare biological efficacy of a standard insecticide and EOs). It is not clear if the percentages (eg Table 5) were transformed before statistical analysis. The calculation of LD50 (Table 2) for 48 hours is inaccurate because the lowest mortality was 57%, and for 24 hours the mortality for the two different concentrations was the same (40%) - it is not clear which of the values was taken to calculate the lethal concentration.</p><p>3. The discussion should be improved. Chemical composition is very important for the discussion and for understanding the mechanism of action. The authors should give a better comparison of their achieved efficacy to other authors who studied EOs with a majority content of pulegone (see e.g. DOI: 10.17221/48/2013-PPS; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2015.06.050">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2015.06.050</ext-link> ect.) or EOs obtained from Origanum majorana against mosquitoes (see e.g. DOI: 10.12980/APJTB.4.2014APJTB-2014-0392; Int J Pharm Pharm Sci, Vol 8, Issue 3, 372-376 ect.). EO efficacy can be influenced by various external factors including the post-application temperature &#x02013; this should be discussed (see e.g. DOI: 10.1016/<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://j.indcrop.2018.01.021">j.indcrop.2018.01.021</ext-link>). The efficacy of sublethal doses or concentrations has been studied &#x02013; and this should be discussed, as well.

Although the topic is relatively interesting and is suitable for publication in PONE, the MS shows some defects that prevent me from recommending the MS for publication. Major comments:</p><p>1. In the introduction, explain goals of the work better. Why did you choose plant - Origanum majorana and why EO and not need extracts - in terms of industrial use of plants. What is the practical impact of work? How does antioxidant capacity and bactericidal activity relate to insecticidal activity? Why other non-target organisms have not been selected.</p><p>The requirement was met, as can be seen in the lines has 53&#x02013;61 and 86-93.</p><p>2. Results: The authors give lethal doses; however, if they want to find correct and relevant values, they should use the probit analysis and compare the CI95 intervals. Only in this way can they claim that a significant difference or progression in efficacy in time has been achieved.</p><p>The requirement was met, as can be seen in the lines -310-317.</p><p>The term Positive Control (Table 2) is not correct. This term is used to describe the control variant where a commercial insecticide has been used (to compare biological efficacy of a standard insecticide and EOs).</p><p>The requirement was met, as can be seen in the lines 308 - 309.</p><p>It is not clear if the percentages (eg Table 5) were transformed before statistical analysis.</p><p>No. The percentages were calculated before statistical analysis.

The requirement has been met, as can be seen on lines 303&#x02013;305. The two 40% concentrations in Table 2 remain the same in 24 hours, as they are part of the larvae mortality control, but do not compromise the OE larvicidal activity, being more active in 24 h than in 48 h. Mortality decreased dramatically during 48 hours and in the static analysis it presented estimated values with very low and insignificant variation in larval mortality, but this result does not compromise the effective larvicidal activity of the EO.</p><p>3.
