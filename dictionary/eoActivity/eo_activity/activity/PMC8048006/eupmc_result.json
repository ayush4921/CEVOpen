    "Ultrasound (US) has become one of the most important techniques in green chemistry and emerging technologies. Many research investigations documented the usefulness of US in a wide range of applications in food science, nanotechnology, and complementary medicine, where effective extraction of natural products is important. However, as with all novel technologies, US has advantages and limitations that require clarification for full adaptation at an industrial scale. The present review discusses recent applications of US in herbal phytochemistry with the emphasis on US effects on chemical structures of bioactive compounds extracted from herbs and their bioactivities. The impact of different US processing conditions such as frequency, intensity, duration, temperature, and pressure on the effectiveness of the extraction process and the properties of the extracted materials are also discussed. Different frequencies and intensities of US have demonstrated its potential applications in modifying, determining, and predicting the physicochemical properties of herbs and their extracts. US has important applications in nanotechnology where it supports the fabrication of inexpensive and eco-friendly herbal nanostructures, as well as acoustic-based biosensors for chemical imaging of the herbal tissues. The application of US enhances the rates of chemical processes such as hydrolysis of herbal fibers, which reduces the time and energy consumed without affecting the quality of the final products. Overall, the use of US in herbal science has great potential to create novel chemical constructions and to be used as an innovative diagnostic system in various biomedical, food, and analytical applications."
