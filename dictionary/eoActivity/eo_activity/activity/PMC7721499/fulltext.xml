This process produces considerable amount of waste water. In this study, ion-exchange column chromatography (Amberlite was the stationary phase) was used to prepare polyphenol-enriched fraction of waste water with improved biological activity. Phenol, flavonoid, and anthocyanin contents were examined before and after using column. Antioxidant activities, DNA protection ability, xanthine oxidase inhibition, and cytotoxicity of this fraction were also determined. The use of Amberlite increased phenol, flavonoid, and anthocyanin contents in fraction compared to the sample before fractionation. The IC<sub>50</sub> values of various antioxidant assays comprises 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate (DPPH), ferric-reducing antioxidant power assay (FRAP), and 2,2&#x02032;-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) which were 226.66&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.25, 126.03&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.11, and 241.43&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.33 for waste water, and these values for fraction were 63.21&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.90, 34.6&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.17, and 50.59&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.75&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/ml, respectively.

Introduction</title><p>Steam distillation or hydrodistillation is the most utilizing method to obtain essential oils from aromatic plants [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. <italic>Rosa damascena</italic> Mill (R. <italic>damascena</italic>) essential oil is well known in the perfume industry, which is a product of the hydrodistillation method.</p><p>Every year during the harvest season and production of essential oil, the low yield of essential oil production leads to generate bulky waste [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These byproducts are the cause of ecological problems. Consequently, less waste production and the recovery of respected substances with biological activities are considered in this industry [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Two types of water and solid waste are present in the hydrodistillation method [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Solid waste is reported as a rich source of polyphenols and polysaccharides [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Waste water is known as a biopollutant, resistant to decompose, and source of soil pollution; hence, it is necessary to manage this waste [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Traditional extraction techniques require long-time processes, high amount of samples, and organic solvents. The drawbacks of these solvents are high cost and poses negative impact on health and environment [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Consequently, the development of precise, cost-effective, and environmental friendly method is considerable [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Amberlite is the trade name of a series of ion-exchange resins. These resins are known as nonpolar adsorbents which are applied to absorb hydrophobic compounds with molecular weight less than 20,000. Amberlite XAD-7 is moderately polar XAD resin and contains acrylic-ester-resin. Therefore, it possesses intermediate polarity, relatively hydrophilic character, and homogeneous nonionic structure [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Polyphenols are the major component of waste waters, and different methods are used to recover several valuable substances in this waste. Quercetin, kaempferol, and ellagic acid have been isolated. The polyphenol-enriched fractions show various biological activities such as tyrosinase inhibition, anti-inflammatory, and antiproliferative effects [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>In this study, the polyphenol-rich fraction was isolated from <italic>R. damascena</italic> waste waters by Amberlite column as the stationary phase. The phenolic compound content and antioxidant activity of byproduct is compared before and after using the column to realize the efficacy of these types of column to concentrate active compounds. Furthermore, XO inhibition and protective effects against DNA damage induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> on isolated human lymphocytes of the fraction were measured to determine the biological activity of separated fraction.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2.

<italic>R. damascena</italic> (Damask rose) is considered as a significant industrial member of the Rosaceae family, and rose oil is a product of hydrodistillation of this aromatic plant [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Waste water and solid waste biomass have been known as byproduct of this hydrodistillation process, and they have been noted as sources of potent active compounds [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we used Amberlite to improve the content of phenolic compounds in separating fractions. Our results confirm the efficacy of this type of column to achieve enrich fraction from waste water. For instance, our results showed phenolic content (phenol, flavonoid, and anthocyanin) of the fraction (after loading on column) was amplified considerably compared with waste water (<xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Using the XAD-7 Amberlite in the extraction process as the stationary phase would be able to separate nonpolar compounds from the extract and increase the concentrations of phenolic compounds. These results are consistent with the data of the previous study, which explains that this type of column increases the phenolic content of <italic>Berberis integerrima</italic> fraction. It can be related to the capacity of this column to interact with nonpolar/moderate polar phenolic compounds with intense hydrogen bonds between the ester groups on the column surfaces and hydroxyl groups of these compounds.</p><p>Indeed, this column can reduce protein and polysaccharide content of the sample and lead to increase in phenolic concentration content [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Recently, there is great attention on the valorization of crude plant materials for developing natural products. Due to the toxicity of organic solvents, using nontoxic solid phase such as Amberlite is a fruitful way for the concentration of bioactive ingredients. Meanwhile, it is important to design one or two steps of fractionation process to enrich these components.</p><p>Aroma compounds, polyphenols, and polysaccharides were recovered compounds in residual mass [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] such as kaempferol and quercetin [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Schieber et al. in their study reported kaempferol 3-O-glucoside as the most predominant substance in distilled rose petals.

So, in the next step, it is necessary to develop and apply chemical techniques to characterize the chemical structure of compounds which are responsible of these biological effects. This step is our research limitation, but it can be a really important approach for valorization of rose waste since this characterization can reveal the potential of rose wastes which is still unexploited.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>4. Conclusion</title><p>This study suggested that Amberlite, as a stationary phase, can be served to expand the phenolic content in the waste fraction instead of expensive and toxic solvents.</p><p>This fraction can be considered as an antioxidant, xanthine oxidase inhibitor, and DNA damage-protection agent, which could be attributable to the high amount of phenolic compound. The byproduct of industrial rose oil production can be considered as a proper source of bioactive compounds, and extraction of these substances in further investigations led to the recognition new products and waste valorization.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was financially supported by the Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (Grant number: 94-01-07-10471).</p></ack><sec sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data Availability</title><p>The data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>The authors declare no conflicts of interest.</p></sec><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Labadie</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name><name><surname>Ginies</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name><name><surname>Guinebretiere</surname><given-names>M.-H.</given-names></name><name><surname>Renard</surname><given-names>C.
