    "Infection represents one of the major risk factors in persistent and difficult to treat wounds. This study focuses on developing antimicrobial wound dressings coated with silver nanoparticles, sodium alginate and different essential oils, to avoid wound infection and biofilm formation. The design of the wound dressings was done by the dip coating method. The characteristics of the developed materials were analysed by physicochemical (FT‑IR, XRD, SEM, TEM) and biological (antimicrobial tests) approaches. The results demonstrated uniform silver nanoparticle formation on the substrate, and the developed nanomodified dressings were proven to have increased antimicrobial and antibiofilm potential. The developed wound dressings based on silver nanoparticles, sodium alginate and essential oils have real potential in treating infections, and can be investigated as an efficient alternative to antibiotics and topical preparations for wound management."
