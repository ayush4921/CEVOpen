Introduction</title><p>Research over the past years has shown that appropriate nutrition is a very important factor for ensuring the good immune status and enhancing the resistance to infections [<xref rid="B1-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, it is not always possible to achieve good nutritional status via the diet alone. In the modern diet, even in industrialized nations, the amount of food has increased, but the quality has decreased due to processing, and it adversely affects an individual&#x02019;s micronutrient status. The increased consumption of ultra-processed foods requires exploration of natural ingredients to include in the diet. Therefore, there is a great deal of interest in research on specific nutrition interventions that could enhance immune function in sub-clinical situations and so prevent the onset of infections [<xref rid="B2-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The problem of antimicrobial resistance must also be addressed by looking for biologically active substances that can become alternative to antibiotics. Some biologically active substances act on pathogenic bacteria while the others are known as modulators of immune system. Various biologically active substances are already known as modulators of immune system. Such compounds include polyphenols [<xref rid="B3-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], micronutrients, and vitamins [<xref rid="B4-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Different ingredients of functional foods have been investigated previously. Those include functional enzymes, probiotics, prebiotics, fibres, phytosterols, peptides, isoflavones, saponins, and others. Most of experiments have been performed in vitro; however, the data might be different in live organisms, as multiple factors may influence the activity of these substances. This is especially important when selecting a few or multiple ingredients in a single formulation. Recently, we have investigated some functional products for the active nutraceutical formula which could benefit both humans and animals. Some constituents including bovine colostrum, probiotics and particularly essential oils (EOs), demonstrated good results in vitro [<xref rid="B5-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Essential oils are complex mixtures of volatile compounds isolated from a whole plant or plant part of known taxonomic origin [<xref rid="B9-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. EOs are generally considered natural and less toxic compounds in comparing with other natural products such as antibiotics [<xref rid="B10-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. EOs act against wide spectrum of pathogenic bacteria at relatively small concentrations and can be used in combination with other active ingredients, such as bovine colostrum or lactic acid bacteria, in an appropriate technological formula [<xref rid="B5-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Moreover, EOs have anti-inflammatory potential and immunomodulatory effect [<xref rid="B11-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>By above-mentioned reasons, EOs are promising substances for the treatment and prophylaxis of infectious diseases both in humans and animals. Recent experiments demonstrated that EOs are active against wide spectrum of antimicrobial resistant isolates including methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, and carbapenemases-producing <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> isolated from humans and animals [<xref rid="B5-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B13-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Moreover, EOs have shown promise as antiviral agents against several pathogenic viruses [<xref rid="B14-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Different studies in animals and humans suggest that EOs have immune function enhancing or immune function balancing properties [<xref rid="B15-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. EOs have been successfully applied as feed additives to broiler chickens or weaned piglets and have clearly shown immunostimulatory effects [<xref rid="B16-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. EOs are rich sources of natural antioxidants, such as the phenolic compounds and due their high redox properties and chemical structure have the ability to neutralize free radicals, chelate transitional metals, and quench singlet and triplet oxygen by delocalization or decomposition of peroxides both in humans and animals [<xref rid="B17-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These properties of EOs can benefit both human and animal health.</p><p>Up to date, multiple experiments have been performed on EOs action on bacteria in vitro, although there is a lack of knowledge on how EOs influence microbial communities in vivo under natural conditions. Recent advances in Next Generation Sequencing allow us to explore microbial communities very efficiently, compared with investigations based on classical microbiological methods. As there is still a lack of information how do EOs acts on the human metabolism and microbial composition, many studies have been performed using animals and particularly pigs as experimental model. The pig model is one of the best preclinical animal models for investigating the gastrointestinal system and its functions in humans and it is widely used for in vivo experiments searching for healthier foods [<xref rid="B20-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The possibility to feed animals with supplementation of EOs is also promising from few perspectives including economic reasons and reducing of antimicrobial usage. There are data that the cinnamaldehyde and thymol (250 mg/kg) can significantly improve digestibility of dry matter, crude protein, and energy in piglets [<xref rid="B22-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The apparent ileal digestibility of crude protein and most amino acids were improved by the cocktail of EOs (300 mg/kg) with menthol as the primary component [<xref rid="B24-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The mechanism of action of EOs is not very clear, but according to some studies, the improved digestibility can be attributed to the enhanced secretion of bile and enzymes [<xref rid="B25-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and to the decreased endogenous losses of nutrients [<xref rid="B24-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. EOs can also modify intestinal microbial composition in weaned piglets and therefore can enrich biosynthesis of proteins and to activate metabolism of lipids [<xref rid="B26-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. EOs have also been shown to regulate intestinal contraction, and thereby to influence the transit of digesta and the resultant interaction between feed and the endogenous enzymes. In pigs the active substances of EOs were found to be absorbed nearly completely in the stomach and the proximal small intestine within 2 h after oral administration [<xref rid="B27-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This means that the absorption of EOs in the foregut protects the possibility of active substances to reach large intestines and directly act on the microbial communities. It is known that microbial changes in the large intestines appear after supplementing of feed by unprotected EOs [<xref rid="B26-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This means that there are other pathways to active substances of EOs interacts with gut microbial communities. However, for the different drug relaxation in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) different types of pharmaceutical coatings are used. The &#x0201c;liquid/solid&#x0201d; coating technique is capable addition toward such an aim for solubility enhancement and dissolution improvement, thereby increasing the bioavailability. It contains liquid medications in powdered form. This technique is an efficient method for formulating water insoluble and water soluble drugs [<xref rid="B28-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. </p><p>It is known that EOs can act on the gut microbiota selectively. For instance, a cocktail of carvacrol, cinnamaldehyde, and capsicum oleoresin increased the population of <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> and the ratio of <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> to <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> in the jejunum and cecum of early-weaned piglets [<xref rid="B29-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The way EOs active substances can modify microbial composition is very important as it is known that the microbiota plays a fundamental role in the induction, training, and functioning of the host immune system [<xref rid="B30-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. It also actively participates in the digestion process. Bacteria belonging to phylum Firmicutes are able to digest long-chain carbohydrates and thus provide the host with additional sources of nutrients [<xref rid="B31-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In addition to its positive role, microbiota has a potential in the development of irritable bowel disease and some other diseases, as well as obesity [<xref rid="B32-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. It may also elaborate toxic products from food residues such as genotoxic hydrogen sulphide [<xref rid="B33-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. As the microbiota has the potential to play different roles in the gut of the host, it is very important to explore the key elements influencing the domination of beneficial bacteria over the pathogenic ones or those that may have a negative impact on health. Different EOs have been investigated regarding their antimicrobial and functional properties. The previous investigations proved that the potential of activity of different EOs is not equal [<xref rid="B34-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]; therefore, the selection of an appropriate EOs with the aim to obtain the most active (or optimal) composition is very important.</p><p>Oregano (<italic>Origanum vulgare</italic>) is a worldwide herb that is extensively used due to its medicinal activities against respiratory, digestive, and urinary disorders in addition to dental caries and rheumatoid arthritis [<xref rid="B35-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. This plant also has strong antioxidative properties [<xref rid="B36-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The aforementioned pharmacological properties of <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> are attributed to its high content in carvacrol and other phenolic compounds [<xref rid="B37-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Peppermint (<italic>Mentha piperita</italic>) is another widespread plant recognized for their special qualities such as anti-bacterial, stimulative, diaphoretic, stomachic, and anti-spasmodic. It reliefs against cold, flu, fever, anorexia, nausea, motion sickness, food poisoning, esophagus and sinus illnesses [<xref rid="B38-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Thyme (<italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic>), which belongs to the Lamiaceae family, is rich source of phytochemicals and bioactive compounds. [<xref rid="B41-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Thyme EO also inhibits growth of pathogenic bacteria and is known as an anti-fungal agent [<xref rid="B42-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Among this, thymus possesses antispasmodic, diaphoretic, antiseptic, disinfectant, carminative, sedative, and expectorant properties that are due to thymol and carvacrol [<xref rid="B43-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. As aforementioned, herbs have wide spectrum of activity the composition of herbs and their EOs are expected to have even wider spectrum of activity including their ability to act on microorganisms and therefore to modify microbiota within the gut. The possibility to reduce the dose of a single essential oil and the usage of a cocktail of EOs can be important to reduce the toxicity of a single active substance as the main active substances from EOs such as thymol and carvacrol are known as toxic at least for plants and insects [<xref rid="B44-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The necessity to explore EOs influence on the microbial communities in the gut is actual for both humans and animals. With the aim to develop nutraceuticals we have explored different active ingredients including bovine colostrum, probiotics and various plant by-products. Here we have investigated the mix of EOs with possibility to include the selected composition as ingredient into the nutraceutical formulation. </p><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxicity of <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> plant extract, <italic>Mentha piperita</italic>, and <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> EOs and to evaluate microbial changes in the guts of pigs as experimental model by supplementing their diet with a combination of the aforementioned plant extract and two essential oils (EEOs) given in the form of bilayer coating tablets.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-animals-10-01734"><title>2.

Formulation of &#x0201c;Liquid/Solid&#x0201d; Phase with Essential Oils</title><p>The innovative technology in the &#x0201c;liquid/solid&#x0201d; phase of the system has been used to improve the bioavailability of sparingly water-soluble active compounds (thyme and mint essential oils) and has been used for powder production. In the &#x0201c;liquid/solid&#x0201d; phase of the system, the technology was carried out: using a simple mixing method, where the solution of active ingredients and excipients were mixed until the formation of suitable powder properties. Magnesium aluminum metasilicate was chosen as the carrier for powder production in the &#x0201c;liquid/solid&#x0201d; phase. The carrier and the mixture of ethanolic oregano extract and mint and thyme essential oils were mixed together in a mortar, sieved through a 1 mm sieve and homogenized for 10 min in a mixer.

The prepared mixture was placed in a ventilated dryer at 40 &#x000b0;C for 24 h. After drying, a free-flowing, yellowish powder was obtained. Chromatographic analysis showed that the amounts of the main biologically active compounds, thymol, carvacrol and menthol, were not significantly reduced in the powder formulations. The liquid/solid powder was further used in the tableting process. The resulting bulk and high-quality powder was tableted into mini-tablets, which are coated with a bilayer coating for different relaxation in the GIT. </p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-animals-10-01734"><title>2.4.

Pigs were bred and delivered from the large capacity pig breeding farm to the Biological Research Centre of Lithuanian University of Health Sciences keeping requirements of animal welfare. Animals were selected from the same two related litters, with the aim to obtain individuals with more similar physiological parameters including body weight. All animal procedures were conducted according to the EU Directive of the European Parliament and of Council from 22 September 2010 [<xref rid="B47-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes and Requirements for the Keeping, Maintenance, and Use of Animals Intended for Science and Education Purposes (2010/63/EU), approved by the order of the Director of the Lithuanian State Food and Veterinary Service [<xref rid="B48-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The number of permission for this study is G2-123. The animals were divided into two groups (control group and experimental group), eight pigs (four males and four females) in each group in separate pens within the same room. All animals were fed regular animal feed, which was prepared according to the standard recipes. Regular feed consisted of barley (44.6%), wheat (20%), soybean meal (7.9%), whey powder (6.5%), corn (5%), soybean protein (3%), sugar beet pulp (3%), and potato protein (2%). Before experiment, the animals were kept in pens for 5 days for adaptation. All animals in the experimental group additionally received ~1 g of the preparation (3 tablets) daily, during the morning feeding until the end of the experiment. This corresponds to 986 mg of oregano extract, 3 mg of peppermint essential oil and 7 mg thyme essential oil. The preparation was added to the feed ensuring that it was consumed by each animal. Duration of the experiment was 30 days. Twenty-four hours before the experiment, fecal content from the rectum was taken for microbiome studies for the comparison of microbial variety among the groups. On the 30th day, the experiment was finished, and animals were sedated and euthanized according to the requirements laid down in the Directive.2010/63/EU. The content (5 g) from the distal part of the ileum, caecum and the central part of the colon was taken into sterile DNase and RNase free tubes, delivered to the Institute of Microbiology and Virology, where specimens were preserved using DNA/RNA Shield (Zymo Research, Irvine, USA) and stored at &#x02212;20 &#x000b0;C.

The obtained DNA then was purified using a DNA Clean &#x00026; Concentrator-25 kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA) to produce about 50 ng/&#x000b5;L of DNA. The same amount of DNA from each group of animals was pooled into one sample per group representing one sample per intestine i.e., three samples were obtained from each group representing samples from ileum, caecum and colon. In total, six samples were obtained representing three intestines from both animal groups. Partial 16S rRNA genes (V3-V4) were PCR amplified followed by barcoding and library preparation of the resulting PCR products in a secondary PCR. Metagenomic libraries were prepared, sequenced, quality controlled, and assembled in an independent service laboratory (BaseClear, The Netherlands). Short paired sequence reads were generated using the Illumina MiSeq system (Illumina, IL, USA) and converted into FASTQ files using the BCL2FASTQ pipeline software, version 1.8.3 (Illumina, IL, USA). Subsequently, reads containing PhiX control signal were removed using an in-house filtering protocol. In addition, reads containing (partial) adapters were clipped (up to a minimum read length of 50 bp). The second quality assessment was based on the remaining reads using the FASTQC quality control tool version 0.11.5. Subsequently, the Illumina paired reads were merged into single reads (so-called &#x0201c;pseudoreads&#x0201d;) through sequence overlap. Chimeric pseudoreads were removed, and the remaining reads were aligned to a combination of the GreenGenes and RDP 16S gene databases. Based on the alignment scores of the pseudoreads, the taxonomic classes were assigned by associating each pseudoread to the best matching operational taxonomic unit (OTU).

The amount of <italic>Barnesiella,</italic> however, was more than eight times less in the experimental group and was probably replaced by <italic>Prevotella</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus</italic>. Although <italic>Barnesiella</italic> has been found in many other studies investigating pig microbiome, there is still no clear information regarding its functions and significance. <italic>Denitrobacterium</italic> has a single species&#x02014;<italic>D. detoxificans,</italic> which is better known as ruminant species and its significance in porcine GI is also still under-investigated. The increased genera in the caeca of experimental pigs therefore are considered as positive or even probiotic (<italic>Streptococcus</italic>) microbiota. The most prevalent species in the caeca of the experimental group of pigs was <italic>Prevotella copri,</italic> whose prevalence was 24.3%, and that is 3.5 times higher than in the control group. The role of this species in pigs is not known yet, but <italic>P. copri</italic> is a common human gut microorganism that is both positively and negatively associated with host health [<xref rid="B61-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The role of <italic>P. copri</italic> in human health is debatable [<xref rid="B62-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. In a recent study, De Filippis et al. have detected distinct strains of <italic>P. copri</italic> by metagenome studies and showed that the diet might select distinctive <italic>P. copri</italic> populations [<xref rid="B62-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], but there is still no data about this in pigs. The most prevalent bacterial species in the caeca in the control group was <italic>Barnesiella intestinihominis,</italic> followed by <italic>P. copri</italic>. <italic>B. intestinihominis</italic> was also more prevalent in the colon content of experimental animals; therefore, there were no big differences in this species between the groups. <italic>B. intestinihominis</italic> has been better described in humans than in pigs and has also been mentioned in a study were this species together with <italic>Enterococcus hirae</italic> had a positive effect on the efficacy of cyclophosphamide used for cancer treatment in mice. The prevalence in healthy pigs of species that were previously associated with human microbiota, demonstrates the similarity between human and porcine microbiota. This fact is important as pig model can gain more knowledge about the pathogenesis of different human diseases. Variety of the rest of the species in the caecum content was similar in both groups demonstrating that EEOs did not have a selective inhibitory effect on the main species normally inhabiting the GI of pigs. Such variety similarities were also observed in other large intestines. The amount of some genera and species, however, differed significantly. In the colon, these differences were also noticeable: while in the control group the most prevalent genus was <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, in the experimental group predominated <italic>Prevotella</italic>. Among streptococci the most prevalent species were <italic>S. lutetiensis</italic> and <italic>S. gallolyticus,</italic> whose prevalence reached almost 30%. Those species were also detected in the experimental group but only in a small amount (1.7%). It is not clear yet if these species of streptococci are widely distributed in pigs, but they are frequently encountered in blood cultures of humans with bacteremia, sepsis, and endocarditis [<xref rid="B63-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Recently, Piva et al. described the first case of isolation of <italic>S. lutetiensis</italic> from a diseased cat [<xref rid="B64-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. <italic>S. lutetiensis</italic> and <italic>S. gallolyticus</italic> belong to the group of <italic>S. bovis</italic> from which they were separated into separate species [<xref rid="B63-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. While <italic>S. lutetiensis</italic> is well known as pathogenic species in humans, particularly in patients with reduced immunity, <italic>S. gallolyticus</italic> is recognized as an inhabitant of the alimentary tract of cattle, sheep, and other ruminants [<xref rid="B65-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. This study revealed that both <italic>Streptococcus</italic> species can be abundant in the intestinal tract of pigs and proves that pigs are carriers of streptococcal species pathogenic to humans. For this reason, <italic>S. gallolyticus</italic> and, particularly, <italic>S. lutetiensis</italic> can be considered as zoonotic bacteria. On the other hand, this is not certain for types or strains that might differ between the hosts, thus more studies in this direction should be performed. <italic>S</italic>. <italic>gallolyticus</italic> is known to be transmitted either directly or indirectly between animals and humans [<xref rid="B66-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. It is also important to note that <italic>S. gallolyticus</italic> is genetically close to the other species&#x02014;<italic>S. suis</italic>&#x02014;which is known as a normal inhabitant of the oral cavity of pigs [<xref rid="B67-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. There are data that it is sometimes difficult to correctly identify <italic>S. suis,</italic> and even molecular methods, including PCR, have a risk of misidentifying <italic>S. gallolyticus</italic> as <italic>S. suis</italic> [<xref rid="B68-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,<xref rid="B69-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. As in this study <italic>S. suis</italic> was detected in very low amounts, taxonomic distribution of <italic>Streptococcus</italic> species should be further studied for more accurate identification. The rest of the species in the colon were more equally distributed by their variety and numbers in both groups of pigs, although big differences were also observed regarding <italic>Clostridium cellulovorans,</italic> which had a higher prevalence in the control group, and different species of <italic>Prevotella,</italic> which were more prevalent in the experimental group. <italic>C. cellulovorans</italic> is known as widely distributed bacteria, which is also found in porcine respiratory tract; however, there is no clear information about its role in pigs.</p><p>Differences between microbial changes within the same animal group at the beginning and at the end of the experiment were recorded. While the main prevalent bacterial genera in both groups at the beginning of the experiment were <italic>Prevotella</italic>, <italic>Clostridium</italic>, <italic>Barnesiella</italic>, and <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, at the end of the experiment the most prevalent genera were <italic>Clostridium</italic>, <italic>Escherichia</italic>, <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, and <italic>Terrisporobacter</italic> in the content of jejuni. In the large intestine, such differences were unequal: in caecum of the control group, <italic>Prevotella</italic> and <italic>Barnesiella</italic> predominated, whereas in the experimental group, the most prevalent were <italic>Prevotella</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus</italic>. In the colon, the most prevalent genera were <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, <italic>Prevotella</italic>, <italic>Clostridium</italic>, and <italic>Barnesiella</italic> in the control group and <italic>Prevotella</italic>, <italic>Barnesiella</italic>, and <italic>Oligosphaera</italic> in the experimental group. In spite of the fact that certain differences were determined between the groups at the end of the experiment, the same genera were detected in both groups only with different proportional count.</p><p>One of the most important questions raised in this study was to evaluate the influence of EEOs on the amount of probiotic bacteria in the GI tract of pigs. The data demonstrated that pigs receiving EEOs supplements had a higher amount of bacteria that are considered as probiotics, including <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, <italic>Bacillus</italic>, <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic>, and <italic>Escherichia</italic>. Only <italic>Streptococcus</italic> and <italic>Enterococcus,</italic> which are also probiotic species, were more numerous in the control group of pigs. The overall number of probiotic bacteria in the experimental group was 1.2 times higher compared to controls and accounted for 27% of the total amount of bacterial reads in the gut of pigs. The number of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> was 2.5 times higher, while the number of <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> was 1.9 times higher in the experimental group. The amount of <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, however, was four times higher in the control group. As the lactic acid bacteria, including <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> and <italic>Bifidobacterium,</italic> are among the better described probiotic bacteria, the role of streptococci for the host is less investigated. This genus is mostly known as a pathogenic for pigs causing different diseases and, particularly, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>suis</italic> infections via skin injuries, which manifest as meningitis and other clinical expressions. There are data that natural probiotics can be a promising tool in cancer prevention and therapy for humans [<xref rid="B70-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]; therefore, the obtained results can be important from the perspective of the usage of nutraceutical preparations containing EEOs. Moreover, <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> and <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> are the genera already known as suppressors of cell proliferation in tumors; their action is associated with oxidative stress [<xref rid="B70-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,<xref rid="B71-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Although EOs anticancer potential is known by acting by multiple pathways and mechanisms, involving apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, antimetastatic and antiangiogenic action, increased levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), and DNA repair modulation [<xref rid="B72-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]-this study reveals that they can also act indirectly, by increasing populations of probiotic bacteria in the host. </p><p>Our previous experiments with separate ingredients and intended for development of nutraceutical formulations have demonstrated good results in vitro, regarding antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria, berries/fruit- by-products and EOs, which demonstrated bacteriostatic or bactericidal effect against wide spectrum of field pathogens [<xref rid="B5-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B73-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>,<xref rid="B74-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Ultrasonication and fermentation of bovine colostrum allowed us to obtain decontaminated colostrum with increased functionality and reduced amount of cadaverine, histamine, and tyramine [<xref rid="B74-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. A new delivery system based on apple pomace-pectin gels ensured the viability of antimicrobial strains [<xref rid="B75-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Current experiment in vivo demonstrated a positive effect of EEOs on the microbiota of the GI tract without reducing variety of species in the large intestine and increasing the number of probiotic bacteria. The study also demonstrated that EEOs combination has no cytotoxic effect at high concentrations (up to 50 &#x000b5;L/mL). The minimum inhibitory concentrations of EOs on different pathogenic strains in our previous study were lower [<xref rid="B5-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] than concentrations which had no cytotoxic effect established in the present study. As there was a decrease of some probiotic bacteria, in particular, gram-positive cocci, more data are required about the possible action of the current EEOs combination on this group of bacteria and about the role of <italic>Streptococcus</italic> spp. in the gut of vertebrates. Moreover, as the EEOs had a certain negative impact on species variety in the ileum, studies on the role of minor species of bacteria in small intestine should be further studied. </p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-animals-10-01734"><title>5.
