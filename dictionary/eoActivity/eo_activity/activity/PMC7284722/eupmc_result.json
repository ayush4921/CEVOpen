    "Biofungicides from plants are a possibility for the biocontrol of fungal diseases, as chemical products may be harmful to the environment and humans. Strawberry is one of the many plants infected by grey mould (Botrytis cinerea), and innovative methods of biocontrol against B. cinerea are under investigation. Clove (Syzygium aromaticum L.) and cinnamon (Cinnamomum cassia L.) accumulate natural compounds, such as eugenol and cinnamaldehyde, which provide antimicrobial and antifungal properties; thus, extracts of these plants could be possibly used as biofungicides. During this study, the inhibition of B. cinerea by clove and cinnamon extracts was evaluated in vitro on Petri plates and detached strawberry leaves; additionally, the chemical composition of volatiles was identified. Clove extract consisted of 52.88% eugenol, and cinnamon consisted of 74.67% cinnamaldehyde. The efficacy of the extracts on detached strawberry leaves showed that 12 mL L-1 concentration of clove extract was effective in suppressing the grey mould infection. Clove and cinnamon extracts showed an equal ability to inhibit B. cinerea on Petri plates. However, the results of the detached strawberry leaves assay showed that clove extract was more effective as a biocontrol product. Overall, clove extract expressed a high potential for application in biofungicides formulations."
