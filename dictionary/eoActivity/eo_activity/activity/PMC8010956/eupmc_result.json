    "<h4>Background</h4>Mahanintangtong is listed in the Thailand's National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM). It is used to treat non-specific fevers and illnesses such as pharyngitis and chickenpox. In this study, we investigated the biological activities of the different medicinal plants used in the Mahanintangtong formula.<h4>Methods</h4>The plant materials were extracted by maceration and decoction. Antimicrobial activity, assessed by disc diffusion method, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were compared with commercially available standard antibiotics. To elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms, inhibition of nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) production was tested by Griess and ELISA techniques. Antioxidant activity was measured by ABTS and DPPH scavenging assays.<h4>Results</h4>The extracts with the best antimicrobial activities were carbonized Tectona grandis showing against Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The ethanol extract of Dracaena loureiroi wood exhibited the highest NO and IL-6 inhibitory activity with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 9.42 ± 1.81 and 12.02 ± 0.30 μg/mL, respectively. The ethanol extract of Pogostemon cablin had the highest TNF-α inhibitory with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 10.68 ± 0.02 μg/mL. In anti-free radical testing, the ethanol extract of D. loureiroi displayed high antioxidant activity by both ABTS and DPPH assays.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The ethanol extracts from carbonized T. grandis and Mahanintangtong showed good antimicrobial activity, especially against S. pyogenes, and good anti-inflammatory activity. These findings are relevant to the pathogenesis of pharyngitis and justify additional studies to see if Mahanintangtong could have clinical utility."
