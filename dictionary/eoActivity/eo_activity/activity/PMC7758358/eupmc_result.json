    "Over the last decade the world has been generating a high quantity of tangerine peel waste (TPW), pomegranate peel waste (PPW) and banana peel waste (BPW). These peels have several economic benefits but there is mismanagement or inappropriate valorisation that could present risks to environment and public health. In the current review, we discussed the use of TPW, PPW and BPW directly for animal feed, soil fertilization, specific compost production and bio-adsorbent. We also discussed the valorisation of these peels for manufacturing the value-added products including enzymes, essential oil and other products that can be used in human food, in medical and cosmetic industry. Additionally, recent studies concerning the valorisation of these peels by biorefinery for bioethanol, biogas and biohydrogen production have been discussed. In the same context some other recent studies about valorisation of microorganisms isolated from these peels for medical, agronomic and industrial interests have been also discussed."
