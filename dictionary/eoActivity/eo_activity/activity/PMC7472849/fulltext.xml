We had previously reported that intra-plantar administration of bergamot essential oil (BEO) containing an aromatic compound significantly suppressed partial sciatic nerve ligation (PSNL)-induced mechanical allodynia <italic>via</italic> opioid mu receptors in mice. However, it has also been reported that the inhalation of BEO reduced formalin-induced nociceptive responses. Therefore, we aimed to elucidate whether the analgesic action of BEO is mediated by olfactory stimulation through volatile components. In the current study, BEO was continuously administered with an osmotic pump during PSNL surgery, and the effects on mice behavior were examined pharmacologically using a double activity monitoring system, which can detect two-dimensional planar motion in a cage with an infrared beam sensor as well as active motion with a running wheel. Here, we report that the two-dimensional planar activity significantly increased in mice with PSNL in the light phase (from 8 o&#x02019;clock to 20 o&#x02019;clock) but not in the dark phase (from 20 o&#x02019;clock to 8 o&#x02019;clock) from the second day after surgery. However, this increase was not observed when BEO was continuously administered. The effect of BEO on the two-dimensional planar counts in mice with PSNL was antagonized by naloxone hydrochloride. Regarding the running wheel activity, the number of rotations decreased by PSNL in the dark phase from the 8th day after surgery. However, this was not apparent with BEO use. The effect of BEO on the number of rotations was also antagonized by naloxone hydrochloride. Furthermore, inhalation of BEO in PSNL mice did not affect mechanical allodynia or the two-dimensional planar motion or running wheel activities. These findings indicate that BEO exhibits an analgesic action, which is mediated by opioid receptors and not by the olfactory system.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>bergamot essential oil</kwd><kwd>neuropathic pain</kwd><kwd>partial sciatic nerve ligation</kwd><kwd>osmotic pump</kwd><kwd>double activity monitoring system<sup>&#x000ae;</sup></kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="39"/><page-count count="12"/><word-count count="6530"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neuropathic pain is a chronic condition that occurs after nerve&#x000a0;compression due to cancer, diabetes, herpes virus infection, and autoimmune diseases (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Woolf and Mannion, 1999</xref>). Currently, millions of patients worldwide endure neuropathic pain (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Tsuda et al., 2005</xref>). One troubling and characteristic symptom of neuropathic pain is hypersensitivity to usually harmless stimuli, a condition known as &#x0201c;tactile allodynia,&#x0201d; which is often resistant to NSAIDs and opioids (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Backonja and Glanzman, 2003</xref>). Various models have been devised to reproduce disease-like conditions in rodents, such as diabetic neuropathy, chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain, antiretroviral drug-induced neuropathy, and spinal and peripheral nerve damage. In recent years, it has become clear that chronic pain can affect cognitive behavior in animal models just as it does in humans (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Guida et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, the establishment of treatments for neuropathic pain is an important issue in terms of reducing anxiety and depression.</p><p>Aromatherapy refers to therapies that use essential oil or plant-derived fragrances to prevent illnesses, improve mental and physical health and relaxation, and relieve stress. Among the essential oils, bergamot essential oil (BEO) is obtained by cold pressing the epicarp and part of the mesocarp of the bergamot fruit (<italic>Citrus bergamia</italic> Risso et Poiteau) (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Moufida and Marzouk, 2003</xref>). BEO is listed in Farmacopea Ufficiale Italiana (1991~) and is used in the pharmaceutical industry, mainly in dentistry, ophthalmology, and dermatology. Recently, several reports showed that the use of aromatherapy massage with various essential oils including BEO could relieve anxiety (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Wilkinson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Seyyed-Rasooli et al., 2016</xref>), depressions (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Wilkinson et al., 2007</xref>), and the perception of pain (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Nasiri et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Seyyed-Rasooli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Gok Metin et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Regarding the pain area, we had reported that the capsaicin-induced nociceptive response was significantly reduced by the intra-plantar injection of BEO in mice (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Kuwahata et al., 2009</xref>). Next, we had reported that the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone hydrochloride significantly reversed the inhibitory effects of BEO on the capsaicin-induced behavioral response (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Katsuyama et al., 2011</xref>). Next, we had performed a 2% formalin test as another nociceptive pain model mice. Plantar subcutaneous injection of 2% formalin caused biphasic (phases I and II) nociceptive behavior consisting of licking and biting. We reported that plantar subcutaneous injection of BEO reduced both the first and late phases of the formalin-induced licking and biting responses (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Katsuyama et al., 2015</xref>). This inhibitory effect of BEO on the formalin-induced behavioral response was also antagonized by naloxone hydrochloride (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Katsuyama et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, BEO can be efficacious in nociceptive pain, and help to suppress partial sciatic nerve ligation (PSNL) mouse-induced allodynia (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Komatsu et al., 2018</xref>). The inhibitory effect of BEO on PSNL-induced allodynia is also antagonized by naloxone methiodide (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Komatsu et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>BEO consists of volatile fractions (93&#x02013;96% of the total) of monoterpene and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (such as limonene) and oxygenated derivatives (such as linalool) and non-volatile fractions (4&#x02013;7% of the total) of waxes, polymethoxylated flavones, coumarins, and psoralens, such as bergapten (5-methoxypsoralen) and bergamottine (5-geranyloxypsoralen) (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Mondello et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Dugo et al., 2000</xref>). Regarding the pharmacological action of scents, BEO inhalation was found to produce anxiolytic-like behavior (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Brederson et al., 2013</xref>). More recently, BEO inhalation has been reported to reduce the behavioral signs of formalin-induced nociception in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Scuteri et al., 2018</xref>). However, it was unclear whether the compound contained in BEO or its volatile component was important for anti-allodynic action. Therefore, we aimed to elucidate whether the analgesic action of BEO is mediated by olfactory stimulation by volatile components. In this&#x000a0;study, we used PSNL mice, a neuropathic pain model, and we set up two experimental systems to examine behavior pharmacologically using a double activity monitoring system<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, which can detect two-dimensional planar motion in a cage with an infrared beam sensor, as well as active motion with a running wheel. First, BEO was continuously administered subcutaneously with an osmotic pump to eliminate the effects of scent as much as possible. Second, we investigated the effects of BEO inhalation on pain-related activities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Animals</title><p>Four-week-old, male <italic>ddY</italic>-strain mice, weighing an average of 24&#x000a0;g (Japan SLC, Inc., Hamamatsu, Japan) were housed in groups (from 6 to 10 per cage) in a light-controlled room (illuminated from 8 o&#x02019;clock to 20 o&#x02019;clock) at 24 &#x000b1; 1&#x000b0;C and 60 &#x000b1; 10% humidity with free access to food (LabDiet 5L37, Japan SLC, Inc.) and water.

On the 7<sup>th</sup> postoperative day, when allodynia was the most intense (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Kusunose et al., 2010</xref>), a comparison of the circadian changes in the two-dimensional planar activity revealed an increase at any time during the light period in PSNL mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2"><bold>Figure 2B</bold></xref>).

An open field test is a test that measures spontaneous activity in a new environment (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Streng, 1971</xref>). On the other hand, a home cage activity test is a test that measures spontaneous activity in the home cage over a medium to long term period (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Miyakawa et al., 2003</xref>). The ability to capture mouse activity patterns over time can be used to analyze circadian rhythms. Regarding the circadian rhythms of PSNL mice, we reported that the paw withdrawal threshold in PSNL mice fluctuated over about 24&#x000a0;h, with the peak of allodynia persisting from the late light phase to the early dark phase (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Kusunose et al., 2010</xref>). During the evaluation of the two-dimensional planar motion in this study, using the double activity monitoring system<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, a peak of abnormal behavior count was observed from 19 o&#x02019;clock to 20 o&#x02019;clock, just before the dark period in PSNL mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2"><bold>Figure 2B</bold></xref>), which indicates that allodynia symptoms were reflected. On the other hand, the theoretical sustained elimination period of BEO initiated by an osmotic pump at the same time of PSNL surgery is 7 days, and the increased counts of PSNL of the light phase was abolished over the 14-day measurement period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2"><bold>Figures 2A, D, F</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. On comparing mechanical allodynia with the von Frey test,&#x000a0;the effect of BEO disappeared at 7 days (data not shown in figures). The PSNL mice showed transient mechanical allodynia with the von Frey test, returning to baseline in the sham-operated group at 42 days post-operative, while two-dimensional planar activity did not return to baseline (data not shown in figures). These results suggest that the changes in the two-dimensional planar activity may reflect factors other than allodynia in PSNL mice. Concerning this phenotype, we considered whether sleep is involved. It has been reported that PSNL mice showed decreased non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM) and sleep duration in the light phase compared to sham-operated mice (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Takemura et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Also, certain essential oils, such as bergamot, have been shown to have a hypnotic effect in humans (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Lillehei and Halcon, 2014</xref>). Therefore, it was considered that the evaluation of the two-dimensional planar motion using the double activity monitoring system<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> can obtain a phenotype that reflects on sleep and allodynia symptoms.</p><p>Regarding the results of two-dimensional planar motion in PSNL mice, the number of counts in the light phase increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2"><bold>Figure 2D</bold></xref>) but not in the dark phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2"><bold>Figure 2C</bold></xref>). This decrease during the dark period may be due to the rebound effect of increased activity during the light period (sleep period).</p><p>The effect of BEO on the two-dimensional planar counts in mice with PSNL was antagonized by naloxone hydrochloride (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3"><bold>Figure 3B</bold></xref>). We performed a continuous administration experiment of the selective &#x003bc;-opioid receptor antagonist &#x003b2;-FNA and the selective &#x003ba;-opioid receptor antagonist norbinaltorphimine, instead of the nonspecific opioid receptor antagonist, naloxone hydrochloride. However, at present, it could not be measured well due to the decrease in the number of two-dimensional planar activities during the day and night (sedative effect) (data not shown in figure). In any case, we had previously reported that PSNL mouse-induced allodynia is suppressed by an intra-plantar injection of BEO (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Komatsu et al., 2018</xref>). This inhibitory effect of BEO on PSNL-induced allodynia is also antagonized by &#x003b2;-FNA but not by naltrindole and norbinaltorphimine (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Komatsu et al., 2018</xref>). These results suggest that the increased counts produced by PSNL, that were abolished by the continuous administration of BEO in the light phase, may be triggered by activation of peripheral &#x003bc;-opioid receptors.</p><p>The voluntary wheel-running activity is commonly used to assess circadian rhythm or motor function and has been proposed as an observer-independent measure for ongoing pain in inflammatory models (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Cobos et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Kandasamy et al., 2016</xref>). In the neuropathic pain model, it has been reported that the running wheel mileage decreases in spared nerve injury (SNI) model mice (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Pitzer et al., 2016</xref>), which is almost in agreement with our results in PSNL mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4"><bold>Figure 4B</bold></xref>).</p><p>We consider that the decrease in the wheel-running activity in PSNL mice was not due to changes in circadian rhythm phases, but due to reduced motivation from chronic pain. Concerning changes in circadian rhythm, the typical wheel-running activity occurred only in the dark phase for both PSNL and sham-operated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4"><bold>Figure 4A</bold></xref>). In the previous report, the expression phase of various clock genes on day 7 after surgery in PSNL mice was unchanged (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Koyanagi et al., 2016</xref>). This finding supports that reduced running wheel activity in PSNL mice does not reflect changes in the rhythmic phase.</p><p>It is widely known that anxiety and depression are secondary to chronic allodynia. A previous report demonstrated that in the 4th week after surgery, PSNL caused significant depression-like behavior in mice, evaluated using the forced swimming test (FST) and the tail suspension test (TST), which was accompanied by increased pain sensitivity (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Gai et al., 2014</xref>). The delayed appearance of decreased motivation associated with pain may contribute to the explanation that a decrease in running wheel activity in PSNL mice has a time lag from the 8th day after surgery. Our study showed that a single dorsal subcutaneous injection of BEO did not affect the running wheel activity in PSNL mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5"><bold>Figures 5C, D</bold></xref><bold>)</bold> and that continuous administration of BEO by osmotic pump corrected the decrease in PSNL mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4"><bold>Figures 4C&#x02013;E</bold></xref>). These results suggest that BEO&#x02019;s effects on the running wheel activity are mediated by something that is not an opioid receptor but is important in analgesia and two-dimensional planar behavior. It was reported that altered serotonergic (5-HT) neurotransmission is implicated in the antidepressant and anxiolytic properties of physical activity, assuming that the running wheel activity in the double activity monitoring system reflects the pathology of anxiety and depression (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Greenwood et al., 2005</xref>). We had recently reported that BEO exerts anxiolytic effects by correcting the neuronal activity of the serotonin nervous system <italic>via</italic> the serotonin 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Rombola et al., 2020</xref>). In light of the previous reports, continuous administration of BEO did not reduce motivation due to the early analgesic action mediated by opioid receptors, and the anxiolytic action mediated by serotonin 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors. These effects are considered to be why the reduction in running wheel activity by PSNL mice did not occur after the 8<sup>th</sup> postoperative day when the release of BEO by the osmotic pump was theoretically completed. On the other hand, a single subcutaneous injection of BEO is expected to increase running wheel activity due to the anxiolytic effect mediated by the serotonin 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor. However, even in the previous paper, a single injection of BEO did not obtain sufficient anxiolytic effect. Therefore, these findings are consistent with those of the present study in which a single-dose was not efficacious. Based on the above, the running wheel activity in the double activity monitoring system may be decreased in PSNL mice due to anxiety and depression secondary to chronic allodynia pathology. It is considered that recovery by BEO is due to the regulation of the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor function.</p><p>We have reported that among the constituents of BEO, linalool is important in analgesia (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Kuwahata et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Sakurada et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Sakurada et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Kuwahata et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Katsuyama et al., 2015</xref>). Linalool is one of the major&#x000a0;volatile aromatic components contained in BEO. The pharmacokinetics of linalool have been reported to be excreted from urine (approximately 60%), exhaled breath (approximately 23%), and feces (approximately 15%) within 72&#x000a0;h after oral administration of radiolabeled linalool to rats (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Parke et al., 1974</xref>). The primary metabolite of linalool is in the form of a glucuronide conjugate and is known to be excreted in the feces (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Antoine et al., 1993</xref>). It is assumed that the metabolites excreted in the feces also have a scent. Therefore, at the beginning of the experiment, it was thought that the scent could be removed by an osmotic pump, but as it is excreted in feces and urine, it is challenging to remove the scent of BEO altogether. However, there are no reports that the metabolites of linalool have an analgesic effect, and it is unlikely that the scents of linalool and linalool metabolites found in manure act in all other complex scents.</p><p>In the inhalation experiment of BEO to PSNL mice, we compared the expression of c-fos, a kind of neural activity marker, by fluorescent immunostaining to confirm that the neural activity of the olfactory bulb was activated. The activation occurred only in a part of the olfactory bulb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6"><bold>Figure 6A</bold></xref>), which was consistent with previous reports (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Loch et al., 2013</xref>). Generally, when inhaling a scented substance, there are three main routes to be absorbed into the body (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Lv et al., 2013</xref>). First, it enters the lungs through the respiratory tract and enters the bloodstream through the capillaries of the alveoli. Second, it is absorbed from the capillaries of the nasal mucosa and enters the bloodstream. Third, through a pathway in which it binds to an olfactory receptor of the olfactory cells of the nasal olfactory epithelium, and acts on the central nervous system as an olfactory neurotransmission signal. Of these three routes, the action of the third is produced at the lowest dose. Therefore, in this study, based on the dose (400 &#x003bc;l/cage) used for the reduction of formalin-induced nociceptive behavior by the inhalation of BEO, we investigated every 1/10 up to the dose of 1/100,000 on the low dose side. As a result, no effect of inhalation was found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7"><bold>Figures 7A&#x02013;C</bold></xref>) (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Scuteri et al., 2018</xref>). We consider that by increasing the inhalation dose and exposure time of BEO and increasing its blood transfer, it is possible to confirm the antiallodynic effect, even in inhalation.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study suggests that BEO exhibits an analgesic action, which is mediated by opioid receptors but not by the olfactory system. There have been several reports that aromatherapy massage relieves pain in humans. However, our results indicate that at least in mice, olfactory receptors are not involved in the analgesia of severe pain, such as neuropathic pain. Our data also indicates that the running wheel activity in the double activity monitoring system<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> is useful as a model of anxiety and depression secondary to chronic allodynia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s6"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author, T.S., upon reasonable request.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The animal study was reviewed and approved by: All experiments were performed following the approval of the Ethics Committee for Animal Experiments at Daiichi University of Pharmacy (Examination number: H30-006, approval number: 29004) and according to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>All authors listed have made a substantial, direct, and intellectual contribution to the work and approved it for publication.
