    "<h4>Background</h4><i>Zataria multiflora</i> Boiss. is known by the common Persian name \"<i>Avishan-e-Shirazi</i>\", is one of the best-known medicinal herbs belonging to the Labiatae (Lamiaceae) family. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anticancer effects and the underlying mechanisms of how <i>Z. multiflora</i> Boiss., essential oil induced apoptosis in the human colorectal tumor cell lines (HCT116 & SW48).<h4>Methods</h4>This study was conducted in National Institute of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (NIGEB) (Tehran, Iran) from 2017 to 2019. The cytotoxicity of this essential oil was assessed by 3- (4,5-di-methylthiazol-2-yl)- 2,5-diphenyltetra-zolium bromide <i>(</i>MTT) assay, trypan blue exclusion, and colony formation assays. We assessed apoptosis and measure intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) by flow cytometry. Then gene expression was analyzed by Quantitative Real-Time RT-PCR.<h4>Results</h4><i>Z. multiflora</i> Boiss., essential oil time- and dose-dependently inhibits cell proliferation and also induced apoptosis in both cell lines via UCP<sub>2</sub>-related mitochondrial pathway by the induction of intracellular ROS.<h4>Conclusion</h4><i>Z. multiflora</i> Boiss., essential oil could be a good candidate for use as an inhibitor of the growth of colorectal tumor cells."
