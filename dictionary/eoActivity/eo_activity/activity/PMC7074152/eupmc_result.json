    "Medicinal plants contain various secondary metabolites. The present study analyzed the essential oil of buds from clove (Syzygium aromaticum L.; Family: Myrtaceae) using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). GC-MS analysis showed the presence of six major phytoconstituents, such as eugenol (66.01%), caryophyllene (19.88%), caryophyllene oxide (5.80%), phenol, 2-methoxy-4-(2-propenyl)-acetate (4.55%), and humulene (3.75%). The effect of clove essential oils (CEO) at 0%, 1%, 2%, and 3% (w/w) on the mechanical and barrier properties of starch films was evaluated. The tensile strength (TS) and elongation (E) of films with clove essential oil were 6.25 ± 0.03 MPa and 5.67% ± 0.08%, respectively. The antioxidant activity of the films significantly increased the millet starch film and presented the lowest antioxidant activity (0.3%) at a 30 minute incubation for the control sample, while increasing CEO fraction in the starch film lead to an increase in antioxidant activity, and the 3% CEO combined film presented the highest antioxidant activity (15.96%) at 90 min incubation. This finding could be explained by the incorporation of clove oil containing antioxidant properties that significantly increased with the incorporation of CEO (p < 0.05). A zone of inhibition ranging from 16 to 27 mm in diameter was obtained when using a concentration of CEO ranging from 1% to 3%. We also observed the presence of an antimicrobial activity on several tested microorganism including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter sp, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Trichoderma fungi. Thus, the current study reveals the possibility of using a millet starch edible film as a preservation method."
