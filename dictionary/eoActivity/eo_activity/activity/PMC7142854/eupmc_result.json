    "The aim of this study was to assess the chemical composition, antioxidant, antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity of the Coriandrum sativum essential oil. Changes in the biofilm profile of Stenotropomonas maltophilia and Bacillus subtilis were studied using MALDI-TOF MS Biotyper on glass and wooden surfaces. The molecular differences of biofilms in different days were observed as well. The major volatile compounds of the coriander essential oil in the present study were β-linalool 66.07%. Coriander essential oil radical scavenging activity was 51.05% of inhibition. Coriander essential oil expressed the strongest antibacterial activity against B. subtilis followed by S. maltophilia and Penicillium expansum. The strongest antibiofilm activity of the coriander essential oil was found against S. maltophilia. A clearly differentiated branch was obtained for early growth variants of S. maltophilia in case of planktonic cells and all experimental groups and time span can be reported for the grouping pattern of B. subtilis preferentially when comparing to the media matrix, but without clear differences among variants. The results indicate that coriander was effective against the tested Penicillium expansum in the vapor phase after 14 days with MID50 367.19 and MID90 445.92 µL/L of air."
