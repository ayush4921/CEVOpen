are an important class of compounds in plants because
they contribute to many of their physicochemical properties such as
color, odor, density, strength, permeability, and hygroscopicity.
Moreover, they also possess significant biological activity and are
thus an important part of the plants&#x02019; defense mechanisms against
biotic and abiotic stresses. Tree needles are a rich source of extractives,
counting for as much as 40% of their dry weight. In this study, chemical
fingerprinting of essential oils and solvent extracts, obtained from
the needles of four conifer tree species (i.e., pine, spruce, larch,
and juniper), was performed by using ultrahigh-resolution Fourier
transform ion cyclotron mass spectrometry. A wide variety of compounds
were detected in the oil samples, including mono-, sesqui-, and diterpenes,
terpenoids, fatty and resin acids, esters, and different phenolic
compounds. Although the main compounds were present in all the four
essential oil samples, large variations in their relative abundances
were observed. In contrast, pine needle hexane and toluene extracts
showed a high content of resin acids, including pinifolic acid, a
rare labdane-type diterpene diacid, and its mono- and dimethyl esters.
Thus, by selecting a suitable solvent, specific types of compounds
may be isolated from tree needles for further biotechnological or
medicinal applications.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>ao0c00901</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>ao0c00901</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plants serve as important
raw materials in food and nonfood industrial
products. They are rich sources of nonstructural compounds, which
find use in pharmaceutical, cosmetics, agricultural, food, and other
related industries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> These bioactive plant compounds
(phytochemicals) are known for their pronounced antioxidant, antifungal,
antibacterial, insecticidal, and herbicidal character.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> Bioactive compounds are also the main constituents of essential
oils, which are obtained via steam distillation or solvent extraction
of plant materials, and have a characteristic aroma or fragrance.
Essential oils are complex chemical mixtures of volatile and nonvolatile
constituents (e.g., terpene hydrocarbons, acids, esters, and phenolic
compounds). These secondary metabolites are important for plants&#x02019;
defense mechanisms against biotic and abiotic stresses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> Essential oils are a great reservoir of bioactive compounds, hence
an increased interest in them.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup></p><p>Conifers
are a group of cone-bearing gymnosperms, found in most
terrestrial habitats. They are seed plants and woody plants that are
mostly trees, though a few are shrubs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> Their ability to habituate in extreme environments and a strong
defense system have contributed to their successful colonization of
the northern hemisphere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> They also contribute
significantly to the terrestrial photosynthesis and biomass production.
Conifers are dominant forest tree species in Finland, with Scots pine
(<italic>Pinus sylvestris</italic> L.) and Norway spruce
(<italic>Picea abies</italic>) being the most abundant,
occupying ca. 66 and 24% of the forested areas, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> Conifers have complex secondary metabolite profiles, consisting
of volatile and nonvolatile compounds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> They are widely distributed worldwide, comprising seven families
with a total of 600&#x02013;630 species. Conifer trees are an important
resource as solid fuel (wood or charcoal) and a source of other plant-derived
products (e.g., resins, essential oils, and ornaments).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup></p><p>Various parts of conifers, such as needles, bark, cones, and
pollen,
are consumed and they have been shown to promote health and prevent
some aging-related chronic diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> Essential
oils obtained from conifer needles and bark have been widely used
as bathing oils, ointments, or inhaling drugs for treating a wide
range of disorders of neuralgic, infectious, and rheumatic origin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> Several studies have reported antioxidant,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> antimicrobial,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> antibacterial,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> larvicidal,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> antifungal,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> herbicidal,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> anti-inflammatory,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> and free radical scavenging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> activity of these oils. Also, resins obtained directly
from coniferous trees possess a considerable antibacterial/antifungal
activity. For instance, a resin salve from Norway spruce has been
used to treat infected skin ulcers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> These
properties are dependent on the chemical composition of the oil, which
is influenced by the type of extraction method used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> Ethanol, methanol, and hexane extracts of conifer needles
have been reported and they also possess considerable antioxidant,
antimutagenic, antitumor, and anticancer activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup></p><p>Several methods, such as hydrodistillation, solvent extraction,
simultaneous distillation&#x02013;extraction, and solid-phase microextraction
have been used for essential oil production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> Hydrodistillation is the most widely used method, although some
water-soluble compounds are not obtained and thermolabile compounds
can be degraded in the process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> Hydrodistillation
can be divided into water distillation and steam distillation. Steam
distillation differs from water distillation so that the steam is
passed through the raw material and the oil evaporates, whereas in
the case of water distillation, the plant material and water are put
to the same vessel and allowed to boil. Direct solvent extraction
is an alternative method used. This method is dependent on the solubility
of compounds and the extracts are usually mixtures of volatile and
nonvolatile constituents. Hexane, toluene, or other nonpolar solvents
are often used. In this method, resin acids, fats, waxes, and pigments
are often extracted, too.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup></p><p>Chemical compositions
of essential oils and solvent extracts obtained
from conifer trees have been extensively studied by gas chromatography&#x02013;mass
spectrometry (GC&#x02013;MS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> The compositions of lipophilic extracts of different pine species
have also been characterized.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> Even though many compounds
can be derivatized prior to the GC&#x02013;MS measurement (in order
to improve thermal stability and enhance volatility) and more polar
columns can be used,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref></sup> GC&#x02013;MS is
still limited to the most volatile compound fractions. As an alternative
strategy, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to
MS has also been used to determine the flavonoid content in buds and
young needles of <italic>Pinus peuce</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>) and <italic>P. abies</italic> and
some other <italic>Pinus</italic> species.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup> Other analytical techniques that have been used
in the analysis of essential oils include ultraviolet (UV), Fourier
transform infrared, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref></sup> but each of these techniques have their own intrinsic limitations
and they do not provide very detailed information on the complex chemical
composition.</p><p>In this work, we used ultrahigh-resolution Fourier
transform ion
cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) MS for direct chemical fingerprinting
of essential oils and solvent extracts obtained from the needles of
four conifer tree species, namely Scots pine (<italic>P. sylvestris</italic>), common juniper (<italic>Juniperus communis</italic>), Norway spruce (<italic>P. abies</italic>), and European
larch (<italic>Larix decidua</italic>). Two different
ionization techniques, negative-ion electrospray ionization, (&#x02212;)ESI,
and positive-ion atmospheric-pressure photoionization, (+)APPI, were
employed to target both polar and nonpolar constituents in the oil
samples. Based on the results, conifer needle essential oils possess
a rich chemistry, which offer a considerable potential for a variety
of biotechnological and medicinal applications.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Mass Spectra

For both solvent extracts, the most abundant ion was observed at <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 349.238413 and was tentatively identified
as pinifolic acid methyl ester (see, discussion below). In the (&#x02212;)ESI

at a high <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> range. After deisotoping,
declustering, and formula assignment, the number of unique monoisotopic
peaks detected (at a signal-to-noise ratio of S/N &#x02265; 5) ranged
between 1200 and 1600 in all the samples (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref></xref>). In contrast, the mass spectra measured
with (+)APPI appeared less complex, with the most abundant ions mainly

(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>). As compared
to (&#x02212;)ESI, both odd- and even-electron ions (radical cations,

The O<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> classes of O<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;O<sub>12</sub> were generally
observed with (&#x02212;)ESI; the most abundant O<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> classes for all the samples were O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>4</sub>. For the solvent extracts, O<sub>6</sub> (for hexane extract) and
O<sub>8</sub> (for toluene extract) were also abundant. The classes
O<sub>11</sub> and O<sub>12</sub> were observed only for the solvent
extracts except for a small amount of O<sub>11</sub> for the pine
essential oil. With (+)APPI, both the hydrocarbon class (HC) and the
oxygen atom classes (O<sub>x</sub>) were observed. A total of seven
different O<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> class were observed (O<sub>1</sub>&#x02013;O<sub>7</sub>) with (+)APPI. Unlike (&#x02212;)ESI,
(+)APPI also efficiently ionized compounds belonging to the O<sub>1</sub> class. For the essential oils, HC was the most abundant class
(ca. 55&#x02013;90%), whereas for the solvent extracts, O<sub>2</sub> was the major one. The classes O<sub>3</sub> and O<sub>4</sub> were
also more abundant for the solvent extracts. Again, the highest O<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> classes (O<sub>5</sub>&#x02013;O<sub>7</sub>) were only observed for the solvent extracts. For most compounds,
(+)APPI produced both protonated molecules and radical cations, not
evenly distributed among different compound classes observed. In some
instances, these two ion types can be used to distinguish between
alicyclic and aromatic compounds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup> The
compound class distributions show that ESI generally ionizes more
polar compounds, and does not ionize hydrocarbons or lowly oxidized
nonpolar species (O<sub>1</sub> class); on the other hand, (+)APPI
ionizes nonpolar aromatic compounds, including hydrocarbons. Thus,
the use of both ESI and APPI provides complementary compositional
information on the oil constituents.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>Van Krevelen Diagrams</title><p>A van Krevelen (VK) diagram is
a plot of the atomic H/C versus X/C ratio (where X is a heteroatom,
e.g., oxygen) for each detected compound and, thus, a straightforward
means for the visualization of complex mass spectrometric data. One
can use VK diagrams to have an overall view on the chemical composition
of a given sample and to compare different samples. In the VK diagrams
of the (&#x02212;)ESI FT-ICR spectra of the essential oils (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>), the O/C ratio
varied between 0 and 0.7, whereas the solvent extracts had a slightly

were centered around O/C &#x02248; 0.1&#x02013;0.3 and H/C &#x02265;
1.5. This is a typical region for lipids (fatty acids, resin acids,
diterpenoids). There were no considerable differences between the
four essential oil samples. In contrast, the both solvent extracts
had generally more condensed (lower H/C) and more oxygenated (higher

a few highly abundant species at high O/C ratios (O/C &#x02248; 0.6&#x02013;1.0)
and H/C &#x02265; 1.3, representing carbohydrates, whereas the toluene

sesquiterpene hydrocarbons. They can be seen at O/C = 0 and H/C &#x02265;
0.5 in the VK diagrams. In addition, many species could be seen around
O/C &#x02248; 0.05&#x02013;0.1 and H/C &#x02265; 1, which likely represent
different terpenoids. Some resin and fatty acids were also present

but there were only a few compounds with high intensity in this region.
For all the essential oils, esters were present at low relative intensity,
around O/C &#x02248; 0.1&#x02013;0.2 and H/C &#x02248; 1.3&#x02013;1.5.
Diterpenoids (resin acids and their derivatives) were the most dominant
compounds in both solvent extracts. The next most abundant were terpene
hydrocarbons and then oxygenated terpenes.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>Unique Compounds Detected
with (&#x02212;)ESI</title><p>The compounds
were tentatively identified by comparing their assigned molecular
formulae with the compounds already identified by using other conventional
methods. Furthermore, public databases (ChemSpider, ChEBI, PubChem,
etc.) were searched to find putative candidates. Only naturally occurring
compounds were considered and the original articles were inspected
for previously reported structures. As no mass spectrometer can differentiate
between isomeric compounds of the same chemical formula, unless hyphenated
with chromatographic (GC, LC) or ion mobility separation or by the
use of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), the analysis is typically
limited to the compound class level, unless a very specific elemental
formula arises. In many cases, however, some unique compounds are
highly enriched over the other (isomeric) constituents, allowing more

the most abundant fatty acids present in the essential oil samples.
In addition, resin acids were detected as well. Abietane-type resin
acids were more abundant than the labdane-type resin acids except
in the juniper oil. Some of the resin acids tentatively identified
were abietic acid, pinifolic acid and its monomethyl ester, isocupressic
acid, and anticopalic acid. To the best of our knowledge, these compounds
have not been reported in the literature to be present in the essential
oils of these plant species, albeit in their organic solvent extracts.
Some acidic compounds were unique to certain samples; coumaric acid
was present only in pine and spruce. An earlier study reported the
presence of this compound in the callus resins of pine and spruce.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref></sup> In addition, 3-methylbutanoic acid was only
detected in the pine oil. The ion with the molecular formula of C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>16</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was most likely geranic acid
(3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienoic acid), a polyunsaturated fatty acid
that has been reported to be a tyrosinase inhibitor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref></sup> This monoterpenoid was detected at high abundance for all
the samples except for the larch oil. Another class of compounds,
which was present in all the samples, were phenylpropanoids, which
are known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref></sup> They were present at low abundance in all the

of putative
compounds present in the hexane and toluene extracts of pine. Given
the nonpolarity of the solvents used, the extracts were dominated
by lipophilic compounds, for example, resin acids, free fatty acids,
diterpenyl alcohols, diterpenyl aldehydes, sitosterols, and phenolic
compounds. The major constituents in both toluene and hexane extracts
were resin acids and the most abundant compounds were the labdane-type
secondary metabolites. The compounds found in these two extracts were
quite similar. The most abundant compound in both was methyl pinifolate
(C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>34</sub>O<sub>4</sub>; <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 349.238396), a monomethyl ester of pinifolic acid (13<italic>S</italic>-labd-8,17-ene-15,18-dioic acid; C<sub>20</sub>H<sub>32</sub>O<sub>4</sub>), a rare labdane-type diterpene diacid (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref></sup> Pinifolic acid was reported as early as 1962 by Enzell and Theander<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref100">100</xref></sup> and was shown to be highly enriched in pine
needles (&#x0223c;65% of the acid fraction of the needle acetone extract).
A major portion of pinifolic acid has been reported to exist as its
monomethyl ester.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref></sup> A free pinifolic acid
was also detected at <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 335.222739
at high abundance. In addition, dehydropinifolic acid, first reported
by Norin et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref></sup> in 1971, was also present
at <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 333.207094. Isocupressic
acid, a diterpene acid that has been found to induce abortion in cattle,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref></sup> was also detected at <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 319.227841. Another labdane-type acid, imbricatolic acid
(also known as dihydroisocupressic acid), was present at moderate
intensity. This compound was first reported as a natural compound
in <italic>Pinus elliottii</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>) and it has since then been reported in several conifer

which have been reported in other studies and were also detected in
this work, include anticopalic acid, first isolated from the bark
and sap wood of western white pine,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref></sup> and
acetylisocupressic acid.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref></sup></p><p>The other
classes of resin acids present in the solvent extracts
were abietane and the pimarane-type resin acids. As these two types
of acids are structural isomers, their differentiation is impossible
without chromatographic separation. However, some studies have shown
that abietic-type diterpenoids are more dominant in Pinaceae species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref></sup> The tentative identifications include abietic acid, dehydroabietic
acid, and hydroxyabietic acid.</p><p>A homologous series of long-chain
fatty acids, ranging from C<sub>12</sub> to C<sub>32</sub>, were also
tentatively identified in the
extracts. Both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids were observed.
In the hexane extract, the most abundant homolog of these fatty acids
was &#x003b1;-linolenic acid, which agrees with the results reported
by Makarenko et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">52</xref></sup> and Berg et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref></sup> In contrast, the most abundant fatty acid in
the toluene extract was palmitic acid; this is in line with the fatty
acid composition of 137 gymnosperm species reported by Mongrand et
al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">53</xref></sup> Other fatty acids identified in the
extracts were oleic acid, linoleic acid, tridecanoic acid, and myristic
acid. A few hydroxy fatty acids were also detected at very low abundance
with 16-hydroxypalmitic acid (juniperic acid) as the most abundant
compound in this group. A homologous series of monoglycerides were
also identified in the extracts. These monoglycerides have been reported
in common juniper.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref></sup></p><p>Phenolic compounds
such as phenolic acids, flavonoids, and lignins
were also tentatively identified. Phenolics are a class of secondary
metabolites with a different chemical nature. Phenolic acids identified
in the extracts were quinic acid, benzoic acid, salicylic acid, and
ferulic acid (present only in the toluene extract). An earlier study
identified quinic acid in Scots pine needles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref></sup></p><p>A few flavonols (quercetin, isorhamnetin, kaempferol, taxifolin)
were present at very low abundance in the toluene extract but were
absent in the hexane extract. A study by Oleszek et al. identified
quercetin and taxifolin in the needles of Scots pine from Brazil.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">54</xref></sup> Lignins, which are phenolic compounds that contain
dimers of phenylpropane, were present only in the toluene extract.
Hydroxymatairesinol, matairesinol, and nortrachelogenin were tentatively
identified; these compounds have been previously reported in the knot
and stem wood of Scots pine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">55</xref></sup> Some sugaric

at low abundance in the toluene extract only. Low-molecular-weight
carbohydrates, such as arabinose, glucose, rhamnose, raffinose, and
pinitol, were also present in the extracts. These compounds were first
isolated from Scots pine needles by Assarsson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">56</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><title>Unique Compounds Detected with (+)APPI</title><p>APPI ionizes
both polar and nonpolar compounds and is less sensitive to ion suppression
effects than ESI; thus, it is less selective toward certain compound
types, for example, acids. Therefore, the combination of both ionization
methods provides complementary data on essential oils and plant extracts.
In this work, (+)APPI analysis targeted nonpolar species and it preferentially
ionized terpene hydrocarbons and their derivatives. For all the essential
oils (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.0c00901/suppl_file/ao0c00901_si_001.pdf">Table S3</ext-link>), the most abundant peak
appeared at <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 205.195077, representing
different sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (C<sub>15</sub>H<sub>24</sub>). Some studies have reported &#x003b2;-caryophyllene and germacrene
D as the most abundant sesquiterpenes in the essential oils of some
conifer species, like <italic>Pinus canariensis</italic> and <italic>Pinus pinaster</italic>, and the second
most abundant to monoterpenes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref58">58</xref></sup> An abundant compound
in the pine and larch oils was a sesquiterpenoid C<sub>15</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>1</sub>, tentatively identified as nootkatone. Adams
et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref59">59</xref></sup> and Stewart et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref></sup> reported only a trace amount of nootkatone in
the essential oils of juniper species, consistent with our results.
Most studies report &#x003b1;-pinene, a monoterpene hydrocarbon (C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>16</sub>), as the main component in the conifer essential
oils.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">57</xref></sup> A peak representing monoterpenes (<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 137.132464) was also observed in the (+)APPI spectra of all the
essential oils. A variability of terpene hydrocarbons may be attributed
to many factors, including climate, geographical location, harvesting
season, genotype, and also the extraction technique used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref58">58</xref></sup> In addition to mono- and sesquiterpenes, a few
other presently unidentified hydrocarbons were detected at <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 297.257567 (C<sub>22</sub>H<sub>32</sub>; DBE = 7), <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 340.312349 (C<sub>25</sub>H<sub>40</sub>; DBE = 6) and <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 365.320255 (C<sub>27</sub>H<sub>40</sub>; DBE = 8). No reasonable
hits by the database search were found for these compounds, except
for C<sub>25</sub>H<sub>40</sub>, which could represent relatively
rare sesterterpenes, possessing a C<sub>25</sub> skeleton.</p><p>Other
oxygenated monoterpenes were present in disparate intensities; a monoterpenoid
C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>18</sub>O<sub>1</sub> (either borneol, citronellal,
eucalyptol, linalool, caraneol, or a mixture of those) was distinct
to the juniper and spruce oils. Oxygenated compounds, such as pinocarvone,
thymol and its methyl ether, carvacrol, verbenone, thujone, and piperitone,
have been reported to occur in conifer species.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref60">60</xref></sup> Oxygenated sesquiterpenes were more abundant
than the oxygenated monoterpenes. The reports have shown that caryophyllene
oxide, germacrene-4-ol, nootkatone, nerolidol, farnesol, nerolidol,
and levomenol are among the most abundant sesquiterpernoids in conifer
needle essential oils.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref60">60</xref></sup> Sesquiterpenoids showed higher abundance in spruce oil as compared
to the other oils, and were less abundant in the solvent extracts.
The amount of diterpenoids was exiguous as compared to monoterpene
and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons in all the four samples. These results
agree well with the previous reports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref62">62</xref></sup> Cembrene, abietal, abietadiene, abietatriene, ferruginol,

and its methyl ester were also present in significant amounts. Other
resin acids that were efficiently ionized by (+)APPI include dehydroabietic
acid, dehydropinifolic acid, isocupressic acid, and anticopalic acid.
Diterpene hydrocarbons and diterpenoids were also found in the solvent
extracts. Isoabienol, a labdane alcohol (a main diterpene alcohol
present in Scots pine needles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref63">63</xref></sup>) was present
at a moderate abundance. Other identified diterpenoids include isopimarol,
dehydroabietal, and ferruginol. Karapandzova et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref60">60</xref></sup> also found these compounds from the essential oil of Macedonian
pine needles (<italic>P. peuce</italic>).</p><p>Diterpene
hydrocarbons, such as abietatriene, norabietatriene,

various pharmaceutical applications to produce microcapsules and nanoparticles
because of their extremely good film-forming and coating properties,
whereas their parent hydrocarbons are frequently used to modify the
concept of skin adhesion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref64">64</xref></sup> Sesquiterpenes
were present in the extracts in moderate amounts but their oxygenated
derivatives were present only in minor quantities. Monoterpene hydrocarbons
and their oxygenated compounds were present at low abundance as compared
to the other types of terpenoids present in both samples, possibly
because of their high volatility.</p><p>All the compounds belonging
to the phenylpropanoid class were present
at low abundance. Diterpenoid esters were the only esters present
at high abundance. &#x003b2;-Sitosterol was the only phytosterol identified
in the extracts. &#x003b2;-Sitosterol is the most common sterol and
it has a broad bioactivity spectrum, possessing antioxidant, anti-inflammatory,
antiapoptotic, hypocholesterolemic, and antihyperglycemic effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref66">66</xref></sup> Tocopherol, a natural source of vitamin E, which
is present in almost all plant leaves, was also detected in both hexane

in the solvent extracts but were less abundant in the essential oils.

combined
with (&#x02212;)ESI and (+)APPI was successfully used for direct chemical
fingerprinting of essential oils and solvent extracts obtained from
four conifer tree species. Based on the results, conifer needles possess
a rich chemistry which differs considerably from that of the sap/heart
wood. Some compounds are only found in the needles and may be present
in high quantities (e.g., pinifolic acid and its derivatives). Whereas
(&#x02212;)ESI targeted mainly both the polar constituents of the oils,
including different acids, esters, alcohols, and phenolic compounds,
(+)APPI targeted more preferentially the nonpolar compounds, especially
terpene hydrocarbons. The hydrodistillation process resulted in the
extraction of most volatile constituents, whereas organic solvents
extracted the more resinous part of the plant. All the main compounds
identified were predominant in all the four essential oil samples
although their relative abundances varied considerably. Resin acids
were dominated by labdane- and abietane-types of compounds. Other
detected compounds included different carbohydrates, flavanols, and
lignans. Some of the detected compounds possess considerable bioactivity
and may serve as potential ingredients in different nutritional or
health products. In conclusion, a direct-infusion ultrahigh-resolution
FT-ICR MS serves as a powerful technique for nontargeted analysis
of complex organic mixtures, like plant extracts and essential oils,
capable of detecting even thousands of compounds in a single run without
chromatographic separation.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Experimental Section</title><sec id="sec4.1"><title>Plant Materials</title><p>Branches of pine (<italic>P.

Extraction</title><p>Solvent extraction of pine needles
was carried out with a Buchi extraction system B-811 (B&#x000dc;CHI
Labortechnik AG, Flawil, Switzerland). Hexane and toluene were used
for the extraction. For each extraction experiment, 20 g of pine needles
were cut and placed into the small sample tube, screwed onto the condenser
tube. Of the solvent, 100 mL was poured into the solvent cup. During
the heating of the solvent, a lower temperature was used for hexane
as compared to toluene because of the higher boiling point of toluene.
The solvent was then evaporated to dryness. The extraction time was
2 h 30 min for both solvents.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.4"><title>Mass Spectrometry</title><p>All essential oil samples were analyzed
on a 12-T Bruker solariX XR FT-ICR mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonik
GmbH, Bremen, Germany), equipped with a dynamically harmonized ICR
cell (Paracell) and an Apollo-II atmospheric pressure ion source (serving
both ESI and APPI). For the (&#x02212;)ESI measurements, 10 &#x003bc;L
of each sample was diluted with 190 &#x003bc;L of methanol. The samples
were directly infused into the ion source at a flow rate of 2 &#x003bc;L/min
using a syringe pump. For the (+)APPI measurements, 10 &#x003bc;L of
each sample was diluted with 90 &#x003bc;L methanol and 10 &#x003bc;L
toluene (serving as a dopant). For the APPI measurements, the flow
rate was increased to 4 &#x003bc;L/min. Dry nitrogen was used as the
drying (4.0 L/min, 220 &#x000b0;C) and nebulizing gas (0.8 bar). The
mass spectra were first calibrated externally by using either sodium
trifluoroacetate clusters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref67">67</xref></sup> (for ESI) or
APCI-L Tuning Mix (part no. G1969-85010; Agilent Technologies, Santa
Clara, CA) (for APPI). Compass ftmsControl software was used for the
data acquisition and the mass spectra were further processed and analyzed
with DataAnalysis 5.0 software (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany).
A total of 300 time-domain transients (8 Mword each) were co-added
and zero-filled once prior to full-sine apodization, fast Fourier
transform, and magnitude calculation. For the peak picking, the signal-to-noise
(S/N) ratio was set at 5.0 and the relative intensity threshold was
0.01%. For the molecular formula assignment, the parameters were as
follows: DBE, 0&#x02013;80; mass error, &#x02264;1 ppm; maximum number
of formulae, 50; elemental formula, <sup>12</sup>C<sub>1&#x02013;100</sub><sup>1</sup>H<sub>1&#x02013;200</sub><sup>14</sup>N<sub>0&#x02013;2</sub><sup>32</sup>S<sub>0&#x02013;1</sub><sup>16</sup>O<sub>0&#x02013;25</sub>. The data sorting and visualization was done with Microsoft Excel
2016 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA) and OriginPro 2019 (Originlab
