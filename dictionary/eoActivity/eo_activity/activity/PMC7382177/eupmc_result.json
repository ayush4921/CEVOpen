    "Different surfactants (lecithin, Tween-20, and Tween-80) were added in composite film during the preparation. Flavor, antimicrobial activity, and physical properties of ginger essential oil -gelatin film were investigated, in order to study the effect of surfactants on the properties of film. The flavor of GEO was not detected in the film prepared with Tween-20 and film prepared with Tween-80, and these two films exhibited stronger antimicrobial activity; film prepared with lecithin possessed higher value in thickness, elongation at break, water solubility, Î”<i>E</i> and opacity, lower value in water vapor property, and tensile strength; attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectrum results suggested, Tween-20 and Tween-80 enhanced the strength of covalent bond, and lecithin weakened the strength of hydrogen bond; and the result of scanning electron microscope showed that Tween-20 and Tween-80 improved the dispersion of oil droplets in film. Therefore, this study suggested that surfactants had an influence on the physical properties and molecular structure of a resulting film; in addition, Tween-20 and Tween-80 could reduce the flavor of GEO in film, improving the antimicrobial activity of film."
