    "Sea buckthorn (SB) has been indicated to have hypoglycemic potential, but its effects on glucose in people with impaired glucose regulation (IGR) are still unclear. This work presents a randomized, double-blinded, two-way crossover study. A total of 38 subjects with IGR completed the intervention of consuming sea buckthorn fruit puree (SBFP, 90 mL/day, five weeks), washing out (four weeks), and then consuming placebo (90 mL/day, five weeks) or in reverse order. In our methodology, a unified questionnaire was used to gather information on physical activity and dietary intakes, and physical examinations were performed to measure blood pressure, height, and weight. Fasting blood samples were collected to detect the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and glycated serum protein (GSP). To calculate the area under the curve of 2 h postprandial plasma glucose (2 h PG-AUC), blood samples at t = 30, 60, and 120 min were also collected and analyzed. Effects of the intervention were evaluated by paired-sample Wilcoxon test and mixed model analyses. Our results show that the FPG in subjects with IGR decreased by a median reduction of 0.14 mmol/L after five weeks' consumption of SBFP, but increased by a median of 0.07 mmol/L after placebo intervention, and the comparison of these two interventions was statistically significant (<i>p</i> = 0.045). During the wash-out period, a similar difference was observed as the FPG decreased in the group that received SBFP intervention first, but increased in another group (<i>p</i> = 0.043). Both SBFP and placebo significantly raised GSP during the intervention period, but lowered it in the wash-out period (<i>p</i> < 0.05), while no significant difference was found between the two interventions. The 2 h PG-AUC remained relatively stable throughout the study. Our results indicated that consumption of SBFP for five weeks showed a slight downward trend on FPG in subjects with IGR."
