    "In the present study, a hydroalcoholic extract of <i>P. khinjuk</i> was obtained by sonication method at 60°C for 50 min. The measurement revealed that the total phenolic content of the extract was 46.0 mg/g. The results showed that the extract has an antioxidant activity of 73.5% and 8.3 (µmol TE/g DW) in DPPH radical scavenging method and FRAP assay, respectively. Also, Balango (<i>Lallemantia royleana</i>) and Fenugreek (<i>Trigonella foenum-graecum</i>) seed gum and their composition (1:1) were used to prepare the nanoemulsion with <i>P. khinjuk</i> extract. The droplet mean size of nanoemulsions was ranged from 310.34 to 354.19 nm. The highest encapsulation efficiency was observed in Balango nanoemulsion. <i>P. khinjuk</i> extract nanoemulsion coating with Balango and TBHQ was added to sunflower oil at 200 and 100 ppm, respectively. During 24-day storage at 60°C, samples were investigated for peroxide, acid, and <i>p</i>-anisidine values at 4-day intervals. The results showed that oils containing nanoemulsion had the highest stability during storage. However, in all samples peroxide, acid and <i>p</i>-anisidine values increased but the rate of oxidation in samples containing both synthetic and natural antioxidants was slower than the control sample."
