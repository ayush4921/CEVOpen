The process of aging affects the brain size, vasculature, cognition [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and genes, through a constant change in structure from birth throughout the lifetime. In addition, loss of memory also occurs with aging, and brain activation becomes more two aspects for memory tasks [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we focused on a few genes associated with the loss of memory, brain derived neurotrophic factor (<italic>Bdnf</italic>), interleukin 6 (<italic>IL-6</italic>), apolipoprotein E (<italic>ApoE</italic>), and intercellular adhesion molecule (<italic>Icam</italic>). <italic>ApoE</italic> is an important gene for normal brain lipid homeostasis [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and is involved in facilitating the availability of cholesterol for development, maintenance and repair of myelin sheaths, nerve membranes, and synaptic connections [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. <italic>Bdnf</italic> is well known marker for play an important role in long-term potentiation (LTP), a key factor in synaptic plasticity [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Cognitive and motivational systems may be affected by neurotoxicity from increased IL-6 expression in the elderly brain [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This can also cause Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In addition, increasing age is associated with memory impairment and memory-related dementia; levels of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, noradrenaline, and adrenaline are also altered [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. For example, dopamine levels have been reported to decrease approximately 10% per decade from early adulthood and have been associated with decreased cognitive function and motor performance [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Cuminaldehyde (CA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>) is an aromatic monoterpenoid volatile compound. It is a natural p-isopropylbenzaldehyde, which is one of the activate compound of the essential oil obtained from eucalyptus, myrrh [<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], caraway (Carumcarvi) [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], Chinese cinnamon (Cinnamomum cassia), and others [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. CA also has been reported as the major component of cumin (Cuminum cyminum), a medicinal plant whose seeds are commonly used as a spice in different cuisines. Structurally, CA is a benzaldehyde substituted at the 4<sup>th</sup> position with an isopropyl group. It is used commercially in perfumes and cosmetics, because it has a pleasant aroma. It has been reported that CA has antidiabetic [<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], antitumor [<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], anti-inflammatory [<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], antimicrobial, and antifungal [<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] effects. Recently, studies have shown CA to exert protective effects against neurodegenerative diseases, in particular Parkinson&#x02019;s disease [<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, despite showing great therapeutic potential for the treatment of aging and memory loss in neurodegenerative diseases, no studies have been directed on these effects of CA so far. Thus, the aim of our study is to evaluate the effect of CA on aging, especially on spatial learning and memory using the human-derived neurotrophic SH-SY5Y cells and aged C57BL/6J mice. We also studied the change in expression levels of the associated genes, <italic>Bdnf</italic>, <italic>IL-6</italic>, <italic>ApoE</italic>, and <italic>Icam</italic> in mice brain.</p><fig id="f1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Structure of cuminaldehyde (CA).</bold></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="aging-13-202516-g001"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Evaluation of the cytotoxicity of cuminaldehyde on human neurotypic SH-SY5Y cells</title><p>First of all, we assessed the effect of CA on SH-SY5Y cells viability using MTT assay.

The exposure of the cells to CA for 72 h showed no significant changes in the percentage of the cell viability compared to the non-treated cells (control group) (P &#x0003e; 0.05).

The incidence of dementia and memory impairment rise with the age. In addition, there are changes in the levels of neurotransmitters [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], for example, dopamine level is reported to decline with age and has been associated with decline in cognitive and motor performance [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, any factor that may enhance the memory of elderly people will be of a great importance. CA is one of the major components of cumin, the second most popular spice in the world after black pepper. In the present study, CA was investigated for its neuroprotective effect and its potential in memory enhancement was evaluated.</p><p>To evaluate the neurotoxicity and the neuroprotective effect of CA, SH-SY5Y cells were treated with Dexa and/or CA. MTT results showed that the treatment of SH-SY5Y cells to CA for 72 h had no significant effect on the cell viability compared to the non-treated cells (control). All the concentrations of CA showed no cytotoxicity on SH-SY5Y cells; and the highest death rate occurred when Dexa was used alone at a concentration of 500 &#x003bc;M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). However, when CA was co-incubated with Dexa, there was a significant decrease in cell death. Our results show that CA has a neuroprotective effect against Dexa-induced neurotoxicity. It has been shown that CA possesses antioxidant activity [<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]; therefore, it can be speculated that the increased cell viability could be due to the antioxidant properties of CA.</p><p>In the present study, we also assessed the effect of CA on mice at the molecular level by real time PCR for analyzing the alterations in expression of some genes. We used the MWM to evaluate learning memory and locomotor activity. CA was administrated orally every day for 30 days at the concentration of 25 mg/kg, and the body weight was measured every day before oral administration. No mortality was observed and our results show that the body weight did not change throughout the experiment. This suggests that CA is not toxic at the tested concentration. However, unfortunately, there are currently no reports on the pharmacokinetics of CA. Therefore, in the future it is necessary to investigate the pharmacokinetics of CA, especially whether it can cross the blood-brain barrier.</p><p>The MWM test, tool for evaluation of spatial learning and memory tasks in rodents, was used in this experiment. Our results show that the escape latency time of aged C57BL/6J mice group administered with CA and young water-treated C57BL/6J mice group was significantly decreased as compared to the aged water-treated C57BL/6J mice from the 4th day of training. After 7 days of training, the escape latency time in aged CA-treated mice (CA group) and young water-treated mice significantly decreased with 20% compared to aged water-treated C57BL/6J mice. On the other hand, C57BL/6J mice administered with CA group show a decrease in the time spent in the quadrant and the crossing time compared to the aged water-treated C57BL/6J mice. Together, all the results obtained show that CA increases learning and memory. In the probe trial, time spent in the quadrant by mice swimming was recorded, and there was a significant increase in time spent swimming between aged CA-treated group and the aged water-treated group. Our findings suggest that CA also increases the locomotor activity in C57BL/6J mice.</p><p>Moreover, to understand the mechanism of action of CA and how it affects learning, memory, and locomotor activity, the expression of several genes involved in nerve cells growth and differentiation, neural circuitry, and synaptic plasticity was analyzed. Using RT-PCR, we analyzed the expression of <italic>Bdnf</italic>, <italic>IL-6</italic>, <italic>Icam</italic>, and <italic>ApoE</italic> genes. Our results showed that brain of 30 days CA treatment in C57BL/6J mice, up-regulated the gene expression of <italic>ApoE</italic> by 58% (P &#x0003c; 0.05) as compared to aged water-treated mice group. ApoE is a polymorphic protein synthesized by astrocytes and microglia but it can also be produced by neurons following injury [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. ApoE is also strongly expressed in brain and liver [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Various studies on learning and memory using animal models have identified many genes associated with these processes. Among them is the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (<italic>Bdnf</italic>), which is also a widely studied gene in brain research. Our results showed that brain of 30 days CA treatment in C57BL/6J mice up-regulated the gene expression of <italic>Bdnf</italic> by 58% as compared to aged water-treated group. The role of Bdnf in learning and memory has already been established by studies carried out in <italic>in vivo</italic> rodent models and <italic>in vitro</italic> cell models. Bdnf mRNA expression was reported to be increased in the hippocampus of rats following training with MWM [<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], radial maze [<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], passive avoidance [<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and contextual fear conditioning [<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Increased Bdnf expression has been shown to play an important role in LTP, which contributes to synaptic plasticity, a form well-established as a cellular model for long-term memory (LTM) formation [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In studies related to synaptic plasticity, LTP is the most studied form and is considered as a cellular correlate of learning and memory. The induction of LTP is associated with activation of multiple signaling cascades and is also activated by Bdnf [<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In some <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, exogenous Bdnf induced the promotion of the LTP in young hippocampal slices [<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and rapidly increased the frequency of micro-excitatory postsynaptic currents in solitary neurons [<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. LTP and synaptic plasticity are known to be associated with ultrastructural changes in the dendritic spines at excitatory glutamatergic synapses [<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. LTP and synaptic plasticity are responsible for enormous ultrastructural changes [<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] such as the formation of new spines [<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and the increase in the number of glutamatergic AMPA receptors at the level of dendritic spines [<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. These results suggest Bdnf plays a crucial role in learning and memory processes.</p><p>In our study, CA treatment down-regulated both, the gene and protein expression of IL-6 compared to the aged water-treated mice. The expression of IL-6 is under tight regulation in the leukocytes; however, with an increasing age this regulation is relaxed, so the circulating levels of IL-6 are reported to increase with an increase in the age [<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. A recent study in old healthy people by Weaver (2002) reported a modest decline in cognitive ability in an age-dependent manner with increase in plasma IL-6. In addition, the results of gene expression levels showed an increase in <italic>IL-6</italic> mRNA levels in the whole brain of aged mice compared to young adult mice [<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Levels of <italic>IL-6</italic> in the several brain parts such as hippocampus, cerebral cortex, cerebellum were increased in aged mice compared to young adult mice [<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Therefore, the increase of gene expression levels of <italic>IL-6</italic> in the aged mice brain is considered potentially relevant, as IL-6 may be neurotoxic and may affect cognitive and motivational systems [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This can also cause Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], in which senile plaques are formed around microglia and astrocytes, considering that the progression of the disease is partially caused by several cytokines and neurotoxic factors [<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The expression of <italic>IL-6</italic> in astrocytes, microglia, and neurons, which has been suggested to decrease the food intake, regulate the ability of memory and learning, cause neurodegeneration, and exacerbate illness induced by other cytokines in the brain [<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Our results suggest that CA decreases the level of <italic>IL-6</italic> and thereby, has a protective effect against IL-6 induced memory loss. Our results also showed an increase in the concentration of noradrenaline by 13% in CA-treated mice compared to the aged water-treated mice. During normal aging, noradrenaline level in old animals is significantly lower in the hypothalamus, as compared to the young rats [<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Stimulation of noradrenergic receptors in the hippocampus results in changes in neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity, considering an important role for noradrenaline in learning and memory. Consistent with this notion, noradrenaline enhances memory for various hippocampal-dependent tasks. For example, the effect of noradrenaline receptor activation on cellular plasticity may cause noradrenaline-dependent regulation of memory in the hippocampus. In addition, dysfunction of the noradrenergic neuromodulatory system causes many cognitive and mental disorders [<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, our results show no significant changes in the concentration of dopamine and adrenaline compared to aged water-treated mice, which contradicts the literature that reports that the levels of dopamine [<xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and adrenaline in the rat and mice brain decrease with aging [<xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Dopamine plays an essential role in the control of body movements. Age-related reductions in dopamine levels are considered to be responsible for many age-related neurological symptoms, such as decreased arm swing and increased rigidity [<xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In addition, fluctuations in dopamine levels can cause age-related changes in cognitive flexibility. In our study, we observed an increase in the swimming time in CA-treated mice, which corroborates with the finding that an increase in neurotransmitter level (dopamine) increases the locomotor activity in CA-treated group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>In conclusion, the treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with CA shows a neuroprotective effect against Dexa-induced cells toxicity. Moreover, oral administration of CA demonstrated learning and memory enhancement in the MWM test. This effect is co-related to a significant increase in the concentration of noradrenaline; and is also related to the up-regulation of <italic>Bdnf</italic>, <italic>Icam</italic>, and <italic>ApoE</italic> expression and down-regulation of <italic>IL-6</italic> expression that is increased with aging. Our findings provide the first evidence that CA has a neuroprotective effect, as well as a spatial learning and memory enhancement potential through the modulation of genes coding for neurotrophic factors and/or those implicated in the imbalance of neural circuitry and impairments of synaptic plasticity. In the previous study, it should be pointed out that CA accounted for 48.77 % of the whole content of cumin essential oil [<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Therefore, it may be considered that daily intake of cumin essential oil can contribute to reasonable improvement of cognitive function. Altogether, our results suggest that CA could be a promising drug for elderly against amnesia and memory deficits.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Chemicals and reagents</title><p>CA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>), Dulbecco&#x02019;s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), Ham and Fetal bovine serum (FBS) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich Co., Ltd.
