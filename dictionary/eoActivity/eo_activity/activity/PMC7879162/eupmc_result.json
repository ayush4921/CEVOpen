    "The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has unfolded an unprecedented worldwide public health emergency with disastrous economic consequences. Around 96 million coronavirus cases have already been identified with over half a million deaths. Despite numerous efforts by the government as well as international organizations, these numbers are still increasing with a surprising rate. Although urgent and absolutely necessary, a reliable therapeutic or vaccine is still elusive and this status quo may remain for an uncertain period of time. Taken that into account, boosting up adaptive immunity through nutritional interventions may help subside this epidemic and save many lives. This review focuses on the nexus between a balanced diet and adaptive immunity, particularly, how a poor diet may lead to compromised immunity resulting in susceptibility to viral infections. Additionally, we discuss how nutrients (vitamins, minerals, trace elements) can be used as a tool to modulate immune response and thus impede viral infections. The study also summarizes nutritional recommendations to combat COVID-19 in different countries and territories as well as dietary sources of those key nutrients. Moreover, different nutritional intervention strategies based on different age groups, physiological and medical conditions were also included, and the challenges of nutritional interventions towards the care of COVID-19 patients are also discussed. Since the availability of a drug or vaccine is still uncertain, a balanced diet or nutrient therapy can be used as a robust strategy to combat COVID-19. Thus, we hope this review may help to make an informed decision with regard to diet choice both at individual level as well as clinical settings."
