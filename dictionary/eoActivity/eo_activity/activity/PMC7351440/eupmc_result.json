    "<h4>Objectives</h4>Over the past 20 years, increasing interest in the use of medicinal plants as alternative or adjuvant treatments of several chronic diseases was observed. Accordingly, <i>Nigella sativa</i> or black cumin, a medicinal plant rich in bioactive compounds, has been used worldwide for food purposes or in traditional medicines. This paper aims to reveal <i>N. sativa</i> potential as adjunct treatment in cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and hematological malignancies, due to their increasing prevalence and difficult management in everyday life.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Databases like PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, Scopus, and Google Scholar were used to search the literature data. Keywords like anti-inflammatory effect, anti-oxidant effect, antihypertensive effects, hypolipidemic effects and hematological malignancies were used in combination with <i>N. sativa.</i><h4>Results</h4>Because of its numerous pharmacological actions, but especially for its anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> studies demonstrated <i>N. sativa</i> positive effect against diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, all of them associated to cardiovascular diseases progression. Also, it was proved to have marked anti-proliferative, cytotoxic, pro-apoptotic, and anti-metastatic effects, in both solid cancers and hematological malignancies.<h4>Conclusion</h4><i>N. sativa</i> used as complementary treatment to classical medications can improve the management of several chronic diseases."
