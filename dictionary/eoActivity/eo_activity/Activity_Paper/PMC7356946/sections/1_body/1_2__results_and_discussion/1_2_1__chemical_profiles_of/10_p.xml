<p>From all the discussed data, the variation of the chemical constituents of the EOs is deduced to the correlation with the variations in plant organ, collection place, and environmental conditions including salinity, temperature, etc., as described in several reports. Additionally, our study supported the previously documented results that deduced the variations of chemical compositions of EOs with the extraction method used.</p>
