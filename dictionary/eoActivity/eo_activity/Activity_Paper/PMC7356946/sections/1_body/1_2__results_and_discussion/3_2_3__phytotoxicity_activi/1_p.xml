<p>The EOs of both 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> and 
 <italic>T. decussatus</italic>, extracted using the HD and MAE methods, exhibited a significant phytotoxic effect on the tested plant; 
 <italic>L. sativa</italic>, and the inhibition was dose-dependent (
 <xref rid="plants-09-00716-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Compared to 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> EOs, 
 <italic>T. decussatus</italic> EOs showed more a phytotoxic effect at the highest concentration (100 μL L
 <sup>−1</sup>), as 
 <italic>T. decussatus</italic> EO extracted using HD method inhibited the seed germination, shoot growth, and root growth of lettuce by 86.6%, 87.4%, and 89.9%, respectively, while the EO extracted using the MAE method inhibited lettuce by 77.7%, 85.8%, and 84.6%, respectively.
