<p id="par0070">The MIC of the protein extracts was determined using micro-broth dilution in sterile 96-well microplates. A 100 μl of protein extract with concentrations of 5 μg/mL, 2.5 μg/mL, 1.25 μg/mL, and 0.62 μg/mL, were poured in the wells 1, 2, 3, and 4 of each column, respectively. Then, 100 μl of 1.0 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL of bacterial or fungal suspension inoculums was added to each well of columns 1−4. For the sample growth control, column 5 was filled by 200 μl of bacterial or fungal suspension. For the medium and protein sample sterility controls, column 6 was filled with 200 μl MHB or MEB, and column 7 was prepared with 200 μl of protein extract, respectively. Finally, column 8 was filled by 100 μl MHB containing ciprofloxacin (5 μg/mL) plus 100 μl bacterial suspensions, as a positive antibiotic control marker. For fungi, column 8 was filled by 100 μl MEB containing fluconazole (12 μg/mL) plus 100 μl of fungal suspensions, as a positive antibiotic marker. Each row of the microplate was allocated to one pathogen. The microplates containing bacteria were covered and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h while those with fungi were incubated at 30 °C for 72 h. The MIC was determined as the lowest concentration which showed no visible growth. The procedure was repeated in triplicates to confirm the antimicrobial effects.
