<p id="par0040">Qualitative analysis was performed by adding of few drops of Mayer’s reagent to solution comprised of a 0.5 g of extracts in 5 ml HCL (1%). The pale precipitate indicated the presence of alkaloids. For the quantitative evaluation of alkaloid, 200 ml of 10 % acetic acid in ethanol was mixed with 2.5 g of extract, and stored at 27 °C for 4 h. After heating on a water bath, NH4OH was added until precipitation was finalized. After the settlement of the yield for 3 h and washing with 20 ml of 0.1 M NH4OH, the precipitate was recovered by decanting using Gem filter paper (12.5 cm) [

 <disp-formula id="eq0005">% Alkaloid = (Initial Wt of Gem filter paper - Final Wt) 100 / Wt of Crude extract used</disp-formula>
