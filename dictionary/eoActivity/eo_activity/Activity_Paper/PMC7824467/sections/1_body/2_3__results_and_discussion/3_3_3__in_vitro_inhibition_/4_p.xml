<p>Along with 
 <italic>L. luisieri</italic> EO, the ascaridole- and 
 <italic>iso</italic>-ascaridole-rich 
 <italic>D. ambrosioides</italic> EO was also able to reduce CCL2 release by LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells, as observed for TNF-α, although in a weaker manner (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00050-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The absence of these compounds in the remaining non-active EOs may suggest that these volatile compounds have an important role in the suppression of some inflammatory processes in which TNF-α and CCL2 are involved. Despite the traditional application of 
 <italic>D. ambrosioides</italic> as a vermifuge and against vomiting [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-10-00050" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], this is the first report on the effect of its essential oil on the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α and the chemokine CCL2. For this reason, this EO and its main component ascaridole, and/or its isomers, should be further investigated to explore their anti-inflammatory activity.
