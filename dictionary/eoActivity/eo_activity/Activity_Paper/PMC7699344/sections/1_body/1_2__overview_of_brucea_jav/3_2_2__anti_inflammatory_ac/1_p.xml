<p>Inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis can affect the small and large intestines and cause a wide range of symptoms such as bloody diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-25-05414" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Hence, there is interest in developing therapeutic strategies to modulate the activity of inflammatory cells and signaling pathways. Such objectives also demand the delivery of therapeutics to disease sites such as the colon and rectum in the case of ulcerative colitis, whereas Crohn’s disease mainly causes inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, especially in the small intestine [

Mechanistically, the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) family of transcription factors is an important mediator of innate and immune responses, which controls the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and modulates immune cell activation [

 <xref rid="B43-molecules-25-05414" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In patients with ulcerative colitis, the NF-κB pathway has a heightened activity, which can lead to an upregulated cytokine expression that contributes to increased levels of inflammation [
