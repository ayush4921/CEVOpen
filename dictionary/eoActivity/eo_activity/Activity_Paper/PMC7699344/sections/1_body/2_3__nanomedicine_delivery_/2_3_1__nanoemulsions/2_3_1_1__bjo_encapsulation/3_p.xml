<p>It is also possible to develop BJO nanoemulsions with liquid or solid granule formulations of around ~35 nm in diameter, which can be useful for oral delivery applications [

Importantly, the nanoparticles exhibited a significantly greater inhibitory activity against lung and prostate cancer cell lines in vitro than BJOE, and they also inhibited cancer cell invasion. There has also been exploration of cationic emulsions incorporating BJO and chitosan that had an average particle diameter of around 42 nm and that exhibited a more effective treatment than BJOE in a mouse model of lung cancer, in addition to exhibiting a synergistic activity together with chemotherapeutic drugs [
