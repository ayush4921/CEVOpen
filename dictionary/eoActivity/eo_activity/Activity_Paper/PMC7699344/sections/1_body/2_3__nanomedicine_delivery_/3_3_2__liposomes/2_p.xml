<p>Cui et al. reported the development of a BJO liposome system comprising 80% phospholipid, 12% cholesteryl, and 8% BJO [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-05414" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The liposomes had an average diameter of around 108 nm. Notably, the BJO liposome sample had a much less acute toxicity than a BJOE sample upon intravenous administration in mice. Pharmacokinetic studies were also conducted for intravenously administrated BJO liposome and BJOE samples, and the liposomes had an appreciably longer circulation time (

A similar performance was also observed in a mouse model with Lewis lung cancer, and the treatment outcomes were judged by tumor weight. An intravenous administration of BJO liposomes led to significant reductions in the tumor weight at 120- and 180-mg/kg doses, while BJOE only caused a reduction at a 180-mg/kg dose (
