<p>In addition to using compositionally diverse BJO, there have recently been more focused efforts to develop nanoemulsions containing highly active quassinoids extracted from BJO. Nanoemulsions containing the BR quassinoid were used to treat ulcerative colitis in mice [

The nanoemulsions had a diameter of around 26 nm and had a 95% BR encapsulation efficiency, and they were tested in parallel with an aqueous BR formulation control. The aqueous formulation was prepared using a sodium carboxymethyl cellulose solution, although there was a poor solubility of BR and high turbidity. The bioavailability levels of BR in the nanoemulsions and aqueous suspension were measured in rats, and the nanoemulsion delivery platform enabled a longer circulation half-life and higher maximum concentration of BR in plasma. Treatment with 0.25-, 0.5-, and 1.0-mg/kg doses of orally administered BR in nanoemulsions showed a dose-dependent efficacy in terms of clinically relevant disease parameters, tissue morphology, and inflammatory markers in a mouse model of chemically induced colitis.
