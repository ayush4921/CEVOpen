<p>Liposomes are another useful nanoparticulate delivery system and are comprised of spherical lipid bilayers that can entrap hydrophilic molecules in the aqueous interior and/or hydrophobic molecules in the lipid bilayer [

Moreover, BJO-loaded liposomes can be functionalized with molecular ligands that bind to receptors that are overexpressed on cancer cells, and one such system based on targeting abundantly expressed receptors present on ovarian cancer cell surfaces led to an increased intracellular uptake of BJO-loaded liposomes, an enhanced cancer cell inhibition, and a greater apoptosis [
