<p>Wang et al. reported another BJO nanoemulsion formulation that consisted of oil-in-water emulsions with a diameter of approximately 41 nm [
 <xref rid="B64-molecules-25-05414" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. A 70-mg/kg dose of nanoemulsions or a refined BJO control sample was orally administered to beagle dogs, and pharmacokinetic studies revealed that the nanoemulsions had a nearly twofold greater maximum BJO concentration and circulation half-life. These findings supported that the nanoemulsion formulation enabled greater oral bioavailability. In vitro cancer cell cytotoxicity testing showed that the nanoemulsions also had an appreciably more potent inhibitory activity against multiple cancer cell lines than a commercial BJOE sample. The improved activity was suggested to be the result of the nanoemulsionâ€™s size, which might have increased the cancer cell contact area. In a cancer mouse model bearing sarcoma tumors, the intragastric administration of the nanoemulsions and BJOE showed that the nanoemulsions had a superior treatment performance, as indicated by a greater reduction in the tumor weight.
