<p>Yang et al. reported the development of a BJO nanoemulsion formulation with an improved safety profile for intravenous administration [
 <xref rid="B63-molecules-25-05414" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. A phase diagram of BJO and isopropyl myristate (IPM) plus different surfactants and cosurfactants in varying ratios was constructed to distinguish systems that formed nanoemulsions vs. those that formed microemulsions. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the lead composition showed spherical particles with a diameter of around 24 nm, which is indicative of nanoemulsions. In vitro hemolysis testing further confirmed that the nanoemulsions did not cause hemolysis, while some hemolysis was observed at high concentrations of BJOE tested in parallel. Vein injection testing in rabbits further showed that the nanoemulsions had more favorable outcomes than BJOE, with a lower likelihood of vein irritation. The nanoemulsions also exhibited a more potent in vitro cytotoxicity against a human cervical cancer cell line than BJOE.
