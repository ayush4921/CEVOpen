<p>NLC loading markedly slowed the BJO release, and slightly more than 50% of BJO was gradually released over a roughly four-day period, as opposed to a rapid release within 10 h for free BJO. In vitro cell cytotoxicity testing against human lung cancer cells further demonstrated that NLCs without BJO did not have an inhibitory activity, while free and NLC-encapsulated BJO exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition (
