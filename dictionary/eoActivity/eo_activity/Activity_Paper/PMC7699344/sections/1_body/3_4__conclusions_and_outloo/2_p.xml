<p>At the same time, there is an outstanding need to continue translational efforts by focusing on specific nanomedicine strategies that have the best potential for targeted applications and envisioned administration routes. For example, a suitable nanoparticle delivery vehicle for oral administration possibly has distinct properties from a suitable one for intravenous administration. Future efforts directed at creating nanomedicine delivery strategies that incorporate molecular components of BJO in a biomimetic manner would be useful, along with a deeper focus on characterizing and optimizing the physicochemical properties of specific nanoparticle-like delivery vehicles. Such work is needed in order to ultimately translate promising nanomedicines into viable clinical treatment options, and additional preclinical research directed at defining acute toxicity and other relevant pharmacological parameters through dose-escalation studies in animal models would also be beneficial as a key step towards eventual human clinical trials. Considering the clinical importance of BJO and emulsion-type BJOE systems already demonstrated in certain parts of the world, there is an enormous worldwide potential to continue pursuing nanomedicine delivery strategies to enhance the prospects of BJO and its molecular components as viable treatment options for a wide range of medical conditions, including various types of cancer and anti-inflammatory diseases.</p>
