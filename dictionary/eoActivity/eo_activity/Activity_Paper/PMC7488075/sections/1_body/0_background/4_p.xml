<p id="Par27">To the best of our knowledge, after conducting extensive research, no studies have been done on the antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic activity of 
 <italic>R. vulgaris</italic> in Kenya. Geographical distribution plays a major role in the phytochemical composition of plants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], hence, provides a good basis for research into the antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic properties of 
 <italic>R. vulgaris</italic> growing in Kenya. Additionally, no studies have been reported on acute toxicity and acute dermal irritation of 
 <italic>R. vulgaris</italic> extracts. The in vivo toxicity evaluation of plant extracts is crucial for the establishment of their safety profiles. Acute toxicity assays provide useful information on the safe and lethal dose range of plant extracts [
