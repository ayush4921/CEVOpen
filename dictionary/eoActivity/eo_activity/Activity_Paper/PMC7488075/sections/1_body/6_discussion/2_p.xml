<p id="Par60">The tested 
 <italic>R. vulgaris</italic> extracts demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against some pathogens that cause oral infections. The methanol extract showed the highest activity followed by the MeOH:DCM extract and lastly, the aqueous extract with the least activity. The methanol (12 mm) and MeOH:DCM (10 mm) extracts of 
 <italic>R. vulgaris</italic> demonstrated the greatest growth inhibition against MRSA with a 
 <italic>p</italic> value of &lt; 0.005. Furthermore, the methanol and MeOH:DCM 
 <italic>R. vulgaris</italic> extracts also showed antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic> with a mean diameter zone of inhibition of 10 mm. Very slight anti-streptococcal activity was demonstrated by the aqueous extracts (7 mm). Different results were obtained by Odongo et al., [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The authors reported that aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>R. vulgaris</italic> showed significant anti-streptococcal activity (24 mm). The inactivity recorded in this study compared to its significant activity in the study by Odongo et al., [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] may be due to variations in phytochemical concentrations as a result of differences in plant factors e.g. age at harvesting as well as other ecological factors [
