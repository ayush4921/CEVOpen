<p>It is evident that the rhizomes and leaves lipophilic profiles are not very rich in secondary metabolites (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00087-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Different results were observed regarding the mass of compounds identified in each extract, 70.3% in rhizomes and 99.6% in leaves. However, the percentage of compounds not identified by GC-MS was, therefore, approximately 30% for rhizome and less than 1% for leaves.
