<p>Some of the terpenoids found in 
 <italic>A. quercifolia</italic> rhizomes are commonly found in plants, including some phytosterols found in our previous works [

 <xref rid="B38-foods-10-00087" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Cycloartane triterpenoidsâ€™ natural occurrence is also vast through the plant kingdom [
 <xref rid="B39-foods-10-00087" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], being cycloartenol the most recognized due to its rule in the phytosterols biosynthesis [
 <xref rid="B40-foods-10-00087" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and consequently in the regulation of important plant functions [
 <xref rid="B41-foods-10-00087" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The occurrence of this type of triterpenoids in 
 <italic>A. quercifolia</italic> rhizomes (
 <xref rid="foods-10-00087-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) may explain the effect that the rhizome intake promotes on young moms. Actually, there are references to the use of several plants to improve breastfeeding [
