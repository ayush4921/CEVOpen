<p>Alkanes represent more than 70% of the wax cuticle constitution, which is indispensable to prevent water loss [

 <italic>A. quercifolia</italic> leaves seems quite normal. 
 <italic>n</italic>-Alkanes are easily distinguishable by their mass spectrum due to the first fragment ion peak, represented by [M − 29]
 <sup>+</sup> ion (loss of a

 <italic>m/z</italic> units (e.g., 43, 57, 71, 85, etc.) are present [
