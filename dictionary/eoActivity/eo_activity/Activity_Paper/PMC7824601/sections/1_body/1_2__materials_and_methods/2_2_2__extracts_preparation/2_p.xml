<p>One extraction ran for 48 h, and the solvent was changed at least twice until no intensive color and increase of extraction weight of the solvent occurred. After an extraction cycle, the solvent was filtered and evaporated. After the three extraction cycles, the extracts were dried until mass consistency before further usage. The procedure was repeated for two more samples, and the average weights of 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane dried extracts (after constant mass) are shown in
