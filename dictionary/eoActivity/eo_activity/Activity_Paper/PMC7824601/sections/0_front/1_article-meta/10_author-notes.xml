  <p>We dedicate this article to the memory of the prestigious pteridologist Peter Hans Hovenkamp (1953–2019), member of the Naturalis Biodiversity Center (Leiden, The Netherlands), chief editor of Blumea, among other merits. He gave a significant contribution to help H.R.Costa in his efforts towards elaborating a checklist of Timor’s ferns, which paved the way to the present article.</p>
