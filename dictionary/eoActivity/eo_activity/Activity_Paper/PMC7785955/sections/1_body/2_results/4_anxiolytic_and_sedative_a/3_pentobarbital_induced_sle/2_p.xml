<p id="p0160">The sedative activity of the leaves of the plant was assessed by the pentobarbital-induced sleeping time test. According to the results, the administration of TIEAE-4 and TIHE-4 (7.60 ± 1.44) significantly decreased (p &lt; 0.01) in the onset of sleeping compared with control (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A). Regarding the duration of sleeping time, a significant increase (p &lt; 0.001) was observed following the administration of TIME-4 (40.40 ± 2.62), TIEAE-4 and TIHE-4 compared with control (15.60 ± 2.51) (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B). The standard group showed a pronounced reduction in latency to sleep and an increase in time spent in sleeping in comparison to control (
