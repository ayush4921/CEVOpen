<p id="p0200">In pharmacological studies, it is found that two distinct phases (early phase and late phase) of pain are provided by formalin test. The possible mechanisms of analgesic effects can be determined by this useful design [
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. This formalin test can also explain the difference between the peripheral and central antinociceptive mechanism of action. Cytokines can elevate pain in different ways. One way (in early phase) is these can directly stimulate the nociceptive neuron and so an acute inflammatory response might be noticed at the early phase right away the formalin injection. Another way (in late phase) is cytokine-induced release of inflammatory mediators particularly serotonin, prostaglandins, bradykinin and histamine and activation of the nociceptive neuron of spinal dorsal horn which elicit delayed inflammatory response observed in late phase [
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The pain sensation in both phases was inhibited significantly by different doses of TIME, TIEAE and TIHE, and late phase was more prominent to reduce the licking behavior. It can be said that TIME, TIEAE and TIHE may have inflammatory properties because of inhibition of licking behavior in late phase. The phytochemical screening revealed that the

Thus, it can be hypothesized that the plant contains potential compounds that show analgesic effect.
