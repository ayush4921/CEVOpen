<p id="p0180">This is the first study to examine the anxiolytic, sedative and analgesic activity of the leaf extracts of a medicinal plant 
 <italic>Tragia involucrata</italic> L. In this study, we utilized methanol, ethyl acetate and n-Hexane solvent extraction methods. We first performed a phytochemical screening and found that the presence of numerous secondary metabolites such as phenols, alkaloids, flavonoids, sterols, tannins, terpenoids etc. TIME demonstrated the higher number of secondary metabolites compared to TIEAE and TIHE. TIME contains phenols, alkaloids, flavonoids, carbohydrates, proteins, tannins, saponins and terpenoids. Because of diverse biological functions, these metabolites have particular interest in drug discovery research and thus advance the medicinal research field [

 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Likewise, the alkaloids have anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, anti-spasmodic and analgesic properties and have growing interest in pharmacological industries [
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Flavonoids, synthesized by plants, are hydroxylated phenolic substances which response to microbial infection [
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. These compounds form a complex with the extracellular and transmembrane protein of bacterial cell wall and thus exhibit anti-microbial properties against a wide array of microorganisms [
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Furthermore, the plant of this study contains substantial quantities of flavonoids to exhibit anxiolytic and analgesic properties [
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Steroids or terpenoids derived from plants are known to have cardiotonic, anti-bacterial and insecticidal properties and are often used as analgesics [
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Tannins have antitumor antibacterial and antiviral activities [
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The plant extracts were also revealed to contain saponins which are known to produce inhibitory effect on inflammation and peripheral analgesic activity [
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and glycosides are widely used to treat congestive heart failure and cardiac arrhythmia [
