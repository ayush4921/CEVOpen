 <bold>Liebermann Burchard test for Sterols:</bold> The test solution was treated with a few drops of acetic anhydride (Liebermann Burchard) solution and mixed properly. Concentrated sulphuric acid was added from the sides of the test tube. Presence of sterol was confirmed by the formation of a brown ring at the junction of two layers and the green color of the upper layer.
