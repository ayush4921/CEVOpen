<p id="Par47">The Comet Assay results were quantified with the CometScore software and the values for the Olive Moment are presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Results demonstrated that all NADESs at a concentration of IC
 <sub>50</sub> showed moderate to subtle genotoxicity effect except XXGly that at a concentration of IC
 <sub>50</sub> demonstrated the highest genotoxic potential in comparison to all other solvents applied at IC
 <sub>50</sub>. Dilution two and four times of the applied IC
 <sub>50</sub> of all solvents showed lack of genotoxic potential on the tested CCL1 cells. The less genotoxic were all tested concentrations of CAPD (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). Further, extracts of 
 <italic>S. scardica</italic> and 
 <italic>P. major</italic> with XXGly and CAPD were tested for genotoxicity with the method of Comet Assay and results are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b. All extracts applied at concentration of IC
 <sub>50</sub> demonstrated genotoxicity on CCL1 cells, especially CAPD/S. Specifically, XXGly/S and XXGly/P, CAPD/S and CAPD/P showed a decrease in the detected genotoxicity when applied at ½ and ¼ of IC
 <sub>50</sub>. The most harmless was CAPD/P.
