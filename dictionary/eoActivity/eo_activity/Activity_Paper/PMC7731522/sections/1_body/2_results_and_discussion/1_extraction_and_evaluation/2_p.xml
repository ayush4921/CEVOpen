<p id="Par38">The dry aerial parts of both selected plants were extracted with the four NADES and 70% ethanol as a reference solvent. Ultrasound assisted extraction was applied to accelerate the process, because of the significant viscosity of the NADES. The NADES choline chloride-glucose 5:2 was too viscous and to enable mass transfer, water was added to make it suitable for extraction. It is known that addition of water decreases the viscosity of NADES and weakens the hydrogen bonding interaction between its components, but dilution under 50% usually does not lead to a matrix disruption into individual components [
