<p id="Par42">The most potent antimicrobial activity was observed for CAPD/S against 
 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> with MICs between 0.098 and 0.39 µg/ml total phenolics. CAPD/P was active against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> (MICs were in the range 1.99–3.98 µg/ml total phenolics). The plantain extracts had MBC = MIC for the three test microorganisms against which they were active. In this case the DEHA activity cannot be determined because it is equal to zero, as there are no metabolically active cells present. The extracts XXPD/S, XXPD/P, XXGlH/S, and XXGlH/P were inactive against the tested microorganisms. Surprisingly, the extracts with the NADES which was most effective in the extraction of phenolics and flavonoids, XXGlH, showed no antimicrobial activity. This could be due to qualitative differences between the extracts obtained with different solvents, however, qualitative analysis of the extracts was not performed. The present work aimed to find the most effective NADES for extraction of 
 <italic>S. scardica</italic> and 
 <italic>P. major</italic> in terms of antimicrobial potential. Optimization of the extraction conditions with the most effective solvent is the subject of future work, when we intend to apply more detailed analysis of individual constituents.
