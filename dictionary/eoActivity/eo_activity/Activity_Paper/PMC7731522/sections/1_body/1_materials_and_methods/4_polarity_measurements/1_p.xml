<p id="Par25">The NADESs polarity was measured by the solvatochromic dye Nile red [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The dye was dissolved in each NADES in the concentration range 0.01–0.1 mM and absorption spectra were recorded. The λ
 <sub>max</sub> was used to calculate the molar transition energy ENR, based on the equation: ENR = hc
 <sub>NA</sub>/λ
 <sub>max</sub> = 28,591/λ
 <sub>max</sub>, (ENR in kcal/mol, λ
 <sub>max</sub> in nm).
