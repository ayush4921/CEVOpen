<p id="Par27">Air-dried plant material was ground using a coffee mill, the average particle size was 0.75 mm. The extraction was performed in a 2 ml Eppendorf tube with 50 mg of plant material and 1.5 ml solvent in an ultrasound bath (Elmasonic S 30 H), without heating, for 1 h. The mixture was then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 40 min and filtered through cotton in a 1 ml volumetric flask. This extract was further used for antimicrobial tests, and analyzed to determine the main groups of bioactive compounds in the extracts. Each extraction procedure was performed in triplicate.</p>
