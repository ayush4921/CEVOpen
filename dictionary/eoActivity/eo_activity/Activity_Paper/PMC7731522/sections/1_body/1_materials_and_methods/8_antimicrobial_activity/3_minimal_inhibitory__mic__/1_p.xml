<p id="Par31">The antimicrobial activity was studied by the broth microdilution method according to ISO 20776-1:2006. Briefly, bacterial and fungal inoculums with concentration 105 CFU/ml were added to 96-well plates containing BHIB or MHB loaded with twofold serial dilutions of pure solvents or extracts differing in the concentration of total phenolics. Pure solvents were applied in an equivalent concentration as for testing the antimicrobial activity. Plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C, excepting the plates with 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> and 
 <italic>Y. enterocolitica</italic>, which were incubated at 30 °C, respectively 26 °C. Gentamicin, penicillin and tetracycline were used as reference antibiotics for bacteria and amphotericin B—for 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, following the requirements of EUCAST. Experiments were performed in triplicate. MICs and MBCs were determined as described before [
