<p id="Par35">The method of Comet Assay was performed under neutral conditions. CCL1 cells—control and treated with increasing concentrations of the tested NADES solvents and extracts for 24 h were mixed with 1.4% low-melting agarose and spread onto already pre-coated with 0.5% normal agarose microscopic slides. The microgels, covered with coverslips to assure equal distribution, were incubated at 4 °C for 10 min. The coverslips were removed after solidification of the microgels. This was followed by a 20-min incubation in a lysis buffer (146 mM NaCl, 30 mM EDTA, pH 8; 10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8; 0.1% 
 <italic>N</italic>-lauroyl sarcosine). Incubation of the gels 3 × 10 min in 0.5×TBE buffer followed. Slides were electrophoresed in 0.5×TBE buffer at 0.45 V/cm for 20 min. The slides were then dehydrated subsequently in 75% and 96% ethanol and left to fully dry at room temperature. The results were visualized under an epifluorescent microscope Leitz—Orthoplan, Vario Orthomat 2 (450/490 nm), after staining with SYBR Green (Roche Diagnostics GmbH). Treatment of CCL1 cells with 5 mM H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> for 30 min at 37 °C was performed as a positive control for genotoxicity. Results were analyzed by using the CometScore software. Three repetitions of the experiment have been done and data were evaluated using Excel 2016 software where values for the measured Olive Moment in all probes were presented as MEAN values ± STDEV.
