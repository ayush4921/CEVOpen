<p>qNMR is the versatile spectroscopic technique to quantify the target molecule in the mixture of metabolites in the extract and to simultaneously inspect the quantitative changes of metabolites with the multivariate analysis. This method can be applied to analyze huge metabolites in natural products samples. In the present study, we measured the 1H NMR spectra of 35 samples of three 
 <italic>Zanthoxlyum</italic> species and developed the rapid discrimination method of three 
 <italic>Zanthoxlyum</italic> species by 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrometry. As a result, the metabolic marker, xanthoxylin, contributed to the discrimination of three species. This simple approach could be applied to the quality assessment of dried 
 <italic>Zanthoxlyum</italic> samples and their extract-containing products.
