 <p>The husks and fruits of 
  <italic>Zanthoxylum</italic> species (Rutaceae) are the popular pungent and spicy ingredients of foods and the traditional medicines in many countries. Three 
  <italic>Zanthoxylum</italic> species, 
  <italic>Z</italic>. 
  <italic>bungeanum</italic>, 
  <italic>Z</italic>. 
  <italic>schinifolium</italic>, and 
  <italic>Z</italic>. 
  <italic>piperitum</italic>, are distributed and intermixed with each other as “Zanthoxyli Pericarpium” in Korean markets. In the present study, we analyzed the ethyl acetate-soluble and nonpolar fractions of 
  <italic>Zanthoxylum</italic> samples by 
  <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrometry and performed a multivariate analysis for finding the discriminant markers between three species. Xanthoxylin was identified as the metabolic marker for the discrimination of 
  <italic>Zanthoxylum</italic> species and quantified by the qNMR approach.
