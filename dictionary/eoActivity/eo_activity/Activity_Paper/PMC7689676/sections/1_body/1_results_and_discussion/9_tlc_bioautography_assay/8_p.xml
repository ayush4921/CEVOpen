<p>Hence, the entire study as per the experimental analysis and pieces of evidence-based research on BGR-34 confirms that its constituents plays many of physiological action in diabetic patients such as decreased glucose production, increase GLP-1 and&amp; GIP, and decrease glucose absorption, increase insulin secretion, enhanced insulin sensitivity, increases glucose uptake and storage by muscle, decrease the chances of diabetic nephropathy, protection from oxidative damage, control blood glucose level, and block DPP4 enzyme activity. Herewith, TLC-bioautography coupled with MS revealed numbers of chemical constituents responsible for the antioxidant and antidiabetic activity in BGR-34. HPTLC profile, bioautographic assay, and physiological function of BGR-34 are summarized in a systematic representation and are followed in
