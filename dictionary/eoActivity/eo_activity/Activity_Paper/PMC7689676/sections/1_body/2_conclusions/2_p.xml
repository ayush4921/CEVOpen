<p>BGR-34 showed the presence of a biologically relevant amount of phenolic and flavonoids. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> activities showed the excellent antidiabetic and antioxidant potential of BGR-34. Further, TLC-bioautographic coupled with MS analysis showed the numbers of antidiabetic and antioxidant bioactive compounds present in BGR-34. Hence, it is to conclude that BGR-34 has an immense potential as antidiabetic and antioxidant mediated via α-amylase, α-glucosidase, and free-radical inhibition. It controls blood glucose and reduces FBG, PPG, and HblAc.
