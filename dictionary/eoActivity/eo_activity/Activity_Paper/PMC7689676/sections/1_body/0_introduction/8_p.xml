<p>However, until now, many of the preclinical and clinical studies have been conducted on BGR-34, but still, there is a lack of research data that could reveal the bioactive compounds responsible for the antidiabetic therapeutic potential in BGR-34. Therefore, the present study is aimed to determine α-amylase, α-glucosidase, and free-radical scavenging-bioactive compounds that potentiate antidiabetic and antioxidants activity of BGR-34 through TLC-bioautographic coupled with MS.</p>
