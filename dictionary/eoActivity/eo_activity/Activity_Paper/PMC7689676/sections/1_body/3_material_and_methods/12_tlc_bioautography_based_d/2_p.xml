<p>To identify antioxidant and α-amylase and α-glucosidase active compounds present in the methanolic extract of BGR-34. The developed different TLC-bioautograms with active zones of DPPH, amylase, and glucosidase inhibition were kept simultaneously in parallel with the controlled TLC plate (second half, track), and the targeted spots were scrapped which were lying in parallel of the active zone. The scrapped spot materials with silica gel were dissolved in HPLC grade methanol through vortex and centrifuge at 4000 RPM for 10 min to separate silica gel particles. The supernatants were separated and filtered (0.2 μM PTFE membrane filter). The obtained samples were processed for mass spectrometry (MS) analysis.
