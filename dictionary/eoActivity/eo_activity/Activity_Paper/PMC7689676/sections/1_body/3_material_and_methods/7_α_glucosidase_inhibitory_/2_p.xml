 </sup> Briefly, 120 μL of each sample was mixed with 20 μL of α-glucosidase solution (1 U/mL in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8) in each defined well of 96-well plate. The obtained mixtures were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The reaction was initiated by adding 20 μL of 
 <italic>para</italic>-nitrophenyl-α-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside (5 mM), and the mixtures were further incubated for 15 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 80 μL of 0.2 M sodium carbonate, and then absorbance was measured at 405 nm. Acarbose was used as the standard. The percent inhibition of α-glucosidase was calculated using the equation
