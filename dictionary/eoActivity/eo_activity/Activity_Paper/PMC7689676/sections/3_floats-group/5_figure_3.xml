  <p>Systematic diagram represents phytopharmacological evaluation of BGR-34. In the study, initially, BGR-34 methanolic extract was processed to HPTLC fingerprinting at 254 nm, 366 nm before derivatization, and 540 mm post derivatization. Further, BGR-34 proceeded for the identification of free radical scavenging compounds, α-amylase, and β-glucosidase inhibitors through the TLC-bioautographic method coupled with mass spectrometry. Several numbers of phytoconstituents were identified in the methanolic extract of BGR-34 having anti-oxidant, α-amylase, and β-glucosidase inhibitory activities. The quantitative validation of BGR-34 was done using berberine and palmetin as major markers of BGR-34. As per the research DATA base of BGR-34, its ingredients, and their phytochemical constituents, it is obliged to many of physiological action in the body such as decreased glucose production by the liver, increase GLP-1 and GIP and decrease glucose absorption in the gut, increase insulin secretion and enhance insulin sensitivity, retard gastric glucose absorption, increase glucose uptake and storage by muscle, reduce the feeling of hunger, decrease the chances of diabetic nephropathy, protect from oxidative damage and control blood glucose level, and block DPP4 enzyme activity.</p>
