<p>As early as 1978, 
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balfwas considered a vulnerable species with fragmented populations. Later in 2004 [
 <xref rid="B34-plants-09-01214" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] the red list of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) specified that 
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf. was a vulnerable species; It indicated that efforts should be made to protect 
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf., since it is the only congener of 
 <italic>P. granatum</italic> L., although, according to Miller [
 <xref rid="B29-plants-09-01214" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-plants-09-01214" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], this information is outdated, since it has been shown that 
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf. is widely found on the island of Socotra and is quite common in some regions. Its total area of occupation is approximately 100 km
 <sup>2</sup>, 2/15 of the total area of Socotra. Miller also reported that 
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf. has a fragmented distribution with different subpopulations and regenerates actively, however, there are large areas in which the tree does not grow, except in some areas with remaining populations without regeneration being observed. The foliage of 
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf. is of no interest to livestock and the tree is not cut down for fuelwood, even in dry spells. Wood is not important neither as firewood nor for construction.
