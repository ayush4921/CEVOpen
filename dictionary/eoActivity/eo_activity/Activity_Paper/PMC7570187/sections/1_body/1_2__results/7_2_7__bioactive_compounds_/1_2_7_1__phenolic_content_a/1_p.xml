<p>Muhammad et al., in 2019 [
 <xref rid="B41-plants-09-01214" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], evaluated the antioxidant potential of methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf. and 
 <italic>P. granatum</italic> L. species, both cultivated in Swat Valley, KP, Pakistan. They found high amounts of total phenols in both species, as well as flavonoids and antioxidant activity, with 
 <italic>P. prototunica</italic> Balf. showing the highest flavonoid content. Antioxidant activity was similar between species. The other study was led by Al-Huqail et al., 2018 [
 <xref rid="B47-plants-09-01214" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. They studied the antioxidant effect of the aqueous ethanolic extracts of the peel and seed coat of 
 <italic>P. granatum</italic> L. and 
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf., in vitro. The two extracts not only contained significantly different phenolic and total flavonoid contents but also different phytochemical constituents. Gas chromatography mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) analysis of the peel extracts revealed twenty-six compounds. The main ones were benzenepropanoic acid, 1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione, 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, 1-(propylthio)-(CAS) ethanol (CAS) ethylalcohol methyl ester of 3-methoxypropionic and 2-propanol. 
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf. seed coat extract showed the presence of 14 phytochemical constituents, the major constituents were Di-2 (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, propanoic acid, 2-hydroxy-ethyl formic acid and benzoic acid. In the malondialdehyde method (MDA), hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) scavenging and DPPHÂ· assays, the two seed coat extracts exhibited very high antioxidant activities, with higher activity observed for the 
 <italic>P. granatum</italic> L. extract [

The importance of the high concentration of phenolic compounds is that they protect cells from the damaging effect of free radicals, molecules responsible for altering biological systems, causing diseases or accelerating aging [
