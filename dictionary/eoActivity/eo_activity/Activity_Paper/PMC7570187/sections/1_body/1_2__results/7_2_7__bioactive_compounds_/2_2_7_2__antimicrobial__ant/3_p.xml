<p>Additionally, Mothana et al., [
 <xref rid="B45-plants-09-01214" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] evaluated the in vitro antiprotozoal activity of twenty Socotra plants including the methanolic extract of the fruit of 
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf., (at 5 concentrations: 0.25, 1, 4, 16, and 64 µg/mL), 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> erythrocytic schizonts were used to evaluate antiplasmodial activity. The antileishmanial activity was evaluated using a model of intracellular amastigotes of 
 <italic>Leishmania infantum</italic>, and finally the antitripanosomal activity was evaluated using intracellular amastigotes of 
 <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> and free trypomastigotes of 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic>. The results indicated that there is selective activity of 
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf., against 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> (IC50 2.2 μg/mL), and a potential for relevant antileishmanial and antitrypanosomal activity was also found. In the same line of research, Barzinji et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-plants-09-01214" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] investigated the antimalarial efficacy in vitro of methanolic and aqueous extracts of thirteen traditionally used plant species from Yemen, including 
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf., in blood samples from positive malaria patients. The methanolic extract from 
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf. (20 mg) was one of the three extracts with the highest antimalarial activity (IC 0.98 µg/mL), and also exhibited schizont maturation inhibition (SMI) of 31.25 μg/mL [
