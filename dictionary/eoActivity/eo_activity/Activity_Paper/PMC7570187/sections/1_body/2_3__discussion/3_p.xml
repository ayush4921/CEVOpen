<p>As we have seen, 
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf. is endemic to Socotra and the distribution is centered on the island, however one of the studies we reviewed used specimens of 
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf. from Pakistan (it was introduced to this region) [
 <xref rid="B41-plants-09-01214" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. It has been reported that with special care, the species can be cultivated outside the region where it grows naturally [
 <xref rid="B22-plants-09-01214" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], making it a viable option for the species to be cultivated in other regions of the world, and taking into account vulnerability reports in Socotra and thus preserve it in a better way. In addition, efforts have been made to collect, conserve and evaluate the germplasm of 
 <italic>Punica</italic> species [
 <xref rid="B58-plants-09-01214" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. There are collections of germplasm of wild and domesticated varieties of pomegranate in gene banks and seed banks of Albania, China, Cyprus, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Iran, Israel, Italy, Morocco, Portugal, Spain, Tunisia, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, USA and Uzbekistan [

 <xref rid="B60-plants-09-01214" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,
 <xref rid="B61-plants-09-01214" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. However the largest collection is located in St. Petersburg, Russia. Interestingly, there was a collection considered the largest, in Garrygala Turkmenistan, but Levin reported that it was destroyed when Turkmenistan separated from Russia [
