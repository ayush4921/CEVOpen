<p>The morphological differences between 
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> and 
 <italic>P. granatum</italic> are evident, but the most notable are the size of the tree, which can be more than 7 m in natural conditions for 
 <italic>P. granatum</italic> L. [
 <xref rid="B41-plants-09-01214" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], as opposed to the 4.5 m (average height) for 
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf. [
 <xref rid="B20-plants-09-01214" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The flowers are orange to red in 
 <italic>P. granatum</italic> L. and smaller bright pink in 
 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf. [

 <xref rid="B56-plants-09-01214" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], and the color of the fruit peel in 
 <italic>P. granatum</italic> L. can be yellow, reddish yellow, or different shades of green and red (starting from pink to crimson); purple is less common and there are even unique varieties, such as black pomegranate, which acquires its coloration from immaturity and remains so until overripe [

 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf., has a fruit that ripens from green to greenish yellow, which can have a dark pink hue and they are in continuous bloom [
