 <italic>P. protopunica</italic> Balf. is one of the only two species of the 
 <italic>Punica</italic> genera, being considered as the “sister” of 
 <italic>P. granatum</italic> L. [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-09-01214" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, according to its origin (due to its independent evolutionary line and which seems to be an ancestor of the 
 <italic>Punica</italic> genera), we think that it may be, beyond the taxonomic classification, the “grandmother” of 
 <italic>P. granatum</italic> L.
