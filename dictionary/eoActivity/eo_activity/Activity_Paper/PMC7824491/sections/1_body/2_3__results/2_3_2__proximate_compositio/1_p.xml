<p>The proximate composition of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seeds showed 24.7% crude protein, 32.5% crude fat, 4.1% ash and 5.8% moisture contents. The basal diet (0.0% black seed) showed a composition of 12.81% moisture, 20.37% ash, 5.5% fat and 26.88% crude protein levels. The experimental diet (basal diet +1.0% black seed) showed a composition of 12.75% moisture, 20.42% ash, 5.6% fat and 26.89% crude protein levels. The experimental diet (basal diet +2.5% black seed) showed 12.71% moisture, 20.39% ash, 5.5% fat and 26.91% crude protein levels. The results of proximate composition revealed that dietary black seed supplementation has not statistically affected moisture and fat contents in muscles tissue of rohu at each sampling day; however, the ash contents were found to be significantly increased following black seed supplementation at 21st and 28th day of sampling. The crude protein levels in muscles tissue of rohu was found to be significantly increased following dietary black seed supplementation in comparison with control at each sampling point (
