<p>The results of the present study showed higher protein efficiency ratio for black seed supplemented rohu at each sampling day. In agreement with present study results, 
 <italic>Oreochromis niloticus</italic> fed black seed meal supplemented diets showed higher protein efficiency ratio [
 <xref rid="B47-animals-11-00048" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The results of the present study also demonstrated that inclusion of black seed in rohu diets has not altered its hepatosomatic index. Likewise, the hepatosomatic index of 
 <italic>Salmo caspius</italic> fed with 3% garlic supplemented diet remained unchanged [
 <xref rid="B48-animals-11-00048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In the present study, muscle protein contents were increased for rohu fed with black seed supplemented diets. The body composition of 
 <italic>Oncorhynchus mykiss</italic> fed on diets supplemented with black seed oil (1 and 1.3%) demonstrated increased protein contents, thus improving its nutritional value [
 <xref rid="B45-animals-11-00048" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. These results are concomitant with our findings. 
 <italic>Dicentrarchus labrax</italic> fed with 1% 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> supplemented diet has showed higher protein contents in its fillets [
 <xref rid="B38-animals-11-00048" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Black seeds are a rich source of several essential amino acids (methionine, threonine, lysine, arginine, glutamic acid, leucine, tyrosine and proline) and (16–19.9%) proteins [
 <xref rid="B49-animals-11-00048" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] (pp. 1314–1315). Thus, their inclusion in the diet has improved the muscles protein contents in rohu.
