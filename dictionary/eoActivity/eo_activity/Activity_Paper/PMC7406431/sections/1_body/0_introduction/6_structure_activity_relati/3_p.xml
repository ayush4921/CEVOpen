<p id="p0035">Structure-activity relationship (SAR) showed that the major factor responsible for greater activity of hispolon as compared to cinnamic acid is the â€“

 </sub> (
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Bisogno et al., 2007</xref>). Substitution of different groups in basic skeleton of hispolon especially in aromatic phenyl ring played an excellent role in enhancing the biological activity. For example placement of methoxy group (
 <bold>-OCH</bold>
 <sub>
  <bold>3</bold>
 </sub>) in phenyl ring increase the cytotoxicity but in comparison, the presence of hydroxyl (
 <bold>-OH</bold>) group decrease the cytotoxicity and this has been supposed to be due to greater lipocity of methoxy (-
 <bold>OCH</bold>
 <sub>
  <bold>3</bold>
 </sub>) as compared to hydroxyl (
 <bold>OH</bold>) (

 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> . It has been observed that gingerdione and its analogues showed a clear difference in their activity affected by substituents in phenyl ring and its terminal part. For example, gingerdione has 10% sweetness as compared to its dehydro-derivative (
 <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Rasul et al., 2013</xref>),-dehydrogingerdione that has 15% sweetness. Similar behavior has also observed in other gingerdione derivatives (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). It means that unsaturation or olefininc double bond and aromatic ring are very important in enhancing the activity (
