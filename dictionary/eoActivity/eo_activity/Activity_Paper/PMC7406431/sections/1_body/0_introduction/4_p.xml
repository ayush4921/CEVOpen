<p id="p0020">Polyphenols are diverse group of naturally occurring compounds with high industrial and medicinal potential (
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Dos Santos et al., 2018</xref>). Mushrooms belonging to the genus 
 <italic>Phellinus</italic> and 
 <italic>Inonotus</italic> are identified as a good source of various polyphenolic compounds with a diverse pharmacological potential. Highly diverse and amply decorated mushroom-derived polyphenolic styrylpyrone scaffolds hold great promise for utilization in drug discovery (
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Lee and Yun, 2011</xref>). One such bioactive styrylpyrone polyphenolic entity present in several mushrooms is hispolon (
