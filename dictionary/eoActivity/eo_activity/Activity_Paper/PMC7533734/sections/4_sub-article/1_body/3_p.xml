<p> Studying the effect of blanching was a brilliant one. Indigenes mostly blanch their veggies in the process of making them into edibles or in preparing them as oral medicines for the locals. Blanching, as against chemical extraction, deactivates bioactive compounds hence reduces the therapeutic effects associated with the plant. This has been implied in the study. Interestingly, however, the antibacterial effects of the plant seemed enhanced with blanching. The authors attributed this to enhanced extractive proficiency of water at boiling water temperature. In addition to this, however, I also think the heat-stabile bioactive antibacterial factor should be identified and pinned down.</p>
