<p>In the present study, the phytochemical, antioxidant and antibacterial activities of the acetone, ethanol, aqueous and blanched extracts of 
 <italic>H. arborescens</italic> leaves were assessed. Phytochemical constituents varied significantly in all the extracts, which revealed the presence of phenols, flavonoids and proanthocyanidin in considerable amounts. The variation in the phytochemical constituents could be attributed to differences in the extracting capabilities of different solvents. Phenols, a major phytochemical found in plants have been widely studied because of their ability to reduce oxidative stress-related degenerative diseases, including cancer. Flavonoids are a group of hydroxylated phenolics, and their beneficial effects are linked to their antioxidant, antibacterial, anticancer, anti-inflammatory
