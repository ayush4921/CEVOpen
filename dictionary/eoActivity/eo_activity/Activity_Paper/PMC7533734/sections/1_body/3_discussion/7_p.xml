<p>The total antioxidant capacity and scavenging activity of the extracts against DPPH+ and ABTS+ were compared to the standards (BHT and rutin) and the extracts showed considerable antioxidant activity. Since positive correlation between polyphenolic compounds and antioxidant activities have been reported

 </sup>; the highest antioxidant activity exhibited by the ethanol extract could be attributed to its high polyphenolic compounds, as shown in this study. In terms of the relatively higher DPPH and ABTS inhibitory potential of the ethanol extract, these results are in agreement with antioxidant activity of other Apiaceae species such as:
