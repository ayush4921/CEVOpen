 </sup>. Briefly, 0.5 g of pulverized 
 <italic>H. arborescens</italic> leaves was measured into 50 mL of 20% ethanol prepared in distilled water. The mixture was heated in a hot water bath for 4 h at 55°C. The mixture was filtered and the residue extracted again with another 50 mL of 20% ethanol. The two filtrates were combined and reduced to 20 mL over a hot water bath (90°C). The concentrated solution obtained was poured into a 250 mL separating funnel containing 20 mL of diethyl ether. The aqueous layer was collected while the ether layer was discarded. 20 mL of n-butanol was added to the filtrate and then washed thrice with 10 mL of 5% sodium chloride. The mixture was heated in an oven (40°C) to constant weight. The percentage saponin content of the sample was calculated using the following formula:
