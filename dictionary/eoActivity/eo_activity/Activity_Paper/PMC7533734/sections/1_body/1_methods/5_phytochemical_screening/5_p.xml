 </sup>. Briefly, a mixture of 3mL of 4% vanillin-methanol solution and 1.5mL of HCl was added to 0.5 mL of each extract. The solution was stirred and incubated at 27 
 <sup>âˆ˜</sup>C for 15 min, after which absorbance was measured at 500 nm. All samples were analysed in triplicate and the amount of proanthocyanidin was expressed as mg/g dry weight of quercetin equivalent (mg QE/g) of the extract with the standard curve: y = 0.0252 x + 0.0482, R 
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9005.
