  <italic>Determination of total phenolic content.</italic>
 </bold> The total phenolic content was determined by spectrometry using Folin-Ciocalteu reagent. Briefly, 0.5 mL of extract (1mg/mL) and gallic acid (0.02 to 0.1mg/mL) were put separately in test tubes. Thereafter, 2.5mL of 10% Folin-Ciocalteu reagent was added into the test tubes, after which 2.5 mL of 7.5% sodium carbonate solution was added to the mixture, stirred and incubated at 40 
 <sup>0</sup>C for 30 min. The absorbance was then measured at 760 nm using a Hewlett Packard VR-2000 spectrophotometer. All samples were analysed in triplicate. Total phenolic content was expressed as milligrams of gallic acid equivalent per gram (mg GAE/g) with the standard curve: y =10.875 x+ 0.1025, R 
 <sup>2 </sup>= 0.996.
