  <italic>DPPH scavenging activity.</italic>
 </bold> There was a dose-dependent increase in percentage inhibitory activity of the extracts and standards against DPPH radical ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). Ethanol extracts showed the highest DPPH radical inhibitory activity; even though the standards inhibited best when compared with the extracts. With respect to the IC 
 <sub>50</sub>, ( 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) the inhibitory capacity of the standards and extracts were in the order: rutin &gt; BHT &gt; ethanol &gt; aqueous &gt; blanched &gt; acetone.
