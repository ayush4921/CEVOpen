<p id="Par24">Genomic libraries were constructed using the KAPAHyper prep kit and sequenced by Illumina Hiseq 2500. We firstly used SSRHunter1.3 to screen the potential SSRs from the sequenced data that had at least five repeats (penta-) for 3–5 bp units. Based on the obtained sequences, primers were designed with Primer Premier 5.0 software (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Fourteen geographically representative samples of 
 <italic>W. salutaris</italic> (LM, TR and FC; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) were first used to test microsatellite amplification and to troubleshoot amplification conditions. Amplifications were performed in 15 μl reactions containing: 1.25U TaKaRa Hot startTaq polymerase, 1X Buffer I, 1 mM dNTPs, 5 μM Primer F and R and 100 ng DNA. The PCR amplification conditions were run as follows: 95 °C for 5 min, 94 °C for 30 s, 30 cycles of 56 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, 94 °C for 30 s, 10 cycles of 53 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s and final extension at 60 °C for 30 min. We then considered 10 markers that presented &gt; 20% polymorphism, which were used to amplify all samples within this study (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The amplified fragments were analysed on a 3730 × 1 gene analyzer (Thermo Fischer Scientific) and examined manually for microsatellite peaks. Allele sizes were determined using GeneMapper 3.2 (Applied Biosystems).
