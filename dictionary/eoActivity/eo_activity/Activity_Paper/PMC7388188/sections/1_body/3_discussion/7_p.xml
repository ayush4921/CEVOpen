<p id="par0115">In summary, we used data mining to identify the characteristics of 52 medicinal herbs, by applying SRKs when analyzing the content of a classical medical text. Further in-depth experimental studies are needed, though our work reduces the time required for future experimentation and product development. Our results enhance the understanding of the previously unknown characteristics of medicinal herbs used for skincare and facilitate the discovering additional novel herbs.</p>
