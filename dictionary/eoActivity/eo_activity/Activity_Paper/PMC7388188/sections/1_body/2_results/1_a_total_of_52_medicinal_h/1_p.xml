<p id="par0040">A total of 52 medicinal herbs were significantly linked to the 26 SRKs (tf-idf index 
 <italic>p-</italic>values &lt;0.05); a color-coded summary is shown in 
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. The SRKs lie on the x-axis and the relevant herbs are indicated on the y-axis. Herbs exhibiting significant associations with the 26 SRKs are shown in different colors. For example, 
 <italic>Panax ginseng</italic> C.A.Mey. (Ginseng Radix) was markedly associated with tonification and anti-aging, but 
 <italic>Rehmannia glutinosa</italic> (Gaertn.) DC. (Rehmanniae Radix) was significantly associated with anti-aging only. The medicinal herbs and their associated SRKs are listed in
