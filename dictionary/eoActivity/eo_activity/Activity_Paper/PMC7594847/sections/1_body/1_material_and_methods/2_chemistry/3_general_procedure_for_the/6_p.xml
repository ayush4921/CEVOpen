<p>A stirred solution of epoxide (
 <bold>28</bold>–
 <bold>38</bold>, 10 mmol) in dry benzene (6 ml) was treated with an excess of isopropylamine or 
 <italic>tert</italic>-butylamine (50 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred for 12 h at 90 °C, and then evaporated. The crude was dissolved in a mixture of MeOH/EtOH 3:7 (20 ml) and treated with 1.2 equivalent of the proper organic acid (oxalic, malic or fumaric acids) to give the corresponding amino alcohol (
 <bold>1</bold>–
 <bold>13</bold>) as a white solid salt.
