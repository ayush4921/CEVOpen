<p>Epichlorohydrin (0.88 ml,11.2 mmol) was added dropwise to a stirred solution of 
 <italic>N-</italic>hydroxy-5-norbornene-2,3-dicarboximide (2 g, 11.2 mmol) and Et
 <sub>3</sub>N (3.12 ml, 22.4 mmol) in anhydrous DMF (8 ml). After stirring for 18 h at rt the reaction mixture was poured into water (50 ml) and extracted with CHCl
 <sub>3</sub> (2×50mL). The organic phases were combined, washed with water (2 × 100 ml), dried (Na
