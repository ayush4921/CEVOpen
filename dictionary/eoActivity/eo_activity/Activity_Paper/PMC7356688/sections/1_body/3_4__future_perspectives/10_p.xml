<p>One of the latest approaches consisted of the lipidomics-proteomics study of the mechanism of action of ArBu on liver cancer and hepatoma cells to clarify its mechanism by bioinformatic methods. ArBu regulated lipid homeostasis which might be closely related to the mechanism of hepatocellular carcinoma. The lipidomics research revealed that lipid concentrations were regulated after the intervention of ArBu. Glycerophospholipid metabolism was the major and commonly affected pathway. ArBu was the potential inhibitor of JAK-STAT3 564 signaling pathway, which could induce apoptosis and promote autophagy of HepG2 cells. Additionally, ArBu could cut off the supplies of multiple amino acids in HepG2 cells and affect the progression of liver cancer as a potential arginine deiminase agonist. In summary, these results provided a rationale for a comprehensive micro-environment regulation on the anti-hepatoma effects of ArBu [
