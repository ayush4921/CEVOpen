<p>In recent years, innovative in silico strategies have contributed valuably to these research processes [

 <xref rid="B98-biomolecules-10-00817" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. VS can be mainly divided into ligand-based (if it uses the molecular properties of compounds to model interactions with targets) and ligand-based (if it employs the 3D structure of targets and compounds to model the interactions) [
 <xref rid="B98-biomolecules-10-00817" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. It involves the computational filtering of a large body of molecules (e.g., those comprising a database) to identify those that have a high probability of activity in the biological test system of interest [
 <xref rid="B99-biomolecules-10-00817" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. This is done through machine learning techniques that generate predictive models [
 <xref rid="B98-biomolecules-10-00817" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. The concept of molecular similarity lies at the heart of such methods since they can discriminate between active and inactive test-set molecules if there are some structural commonalities (in terms of the descriptors available) between the training-set actives and/or structural dissimilarity between the training-set actives and inactives [
 <xref rid="B99-biomolecules-10-00817" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. The application of Machine learning similarity-based methods relies on the assumption that biologically, topologically and chemically similar compounds have similar functions and bioactivities and, therefore, they have similar targets [
 <xref rid="B98-biomolecules-10-00817" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Recently, it was presented a resource named Chemical Checker (CC) which provides processed, harmonized, and integrated bioactivity data (from chemical properties to their clinical outcomes) on ~800,000 small molecules. This tool is based on the so-called “similarity principle” previously mentioned (similar compounds not only show similar chemical properties but also show similar biological behavior. Molecules with similar cellular sensitivity profiles, or causing similar side effects, often share the same mechanism of action, even when their chemical structures appear unrelated). Thus, CC can aid drug discovery tasks, including target identification and library characterization [
