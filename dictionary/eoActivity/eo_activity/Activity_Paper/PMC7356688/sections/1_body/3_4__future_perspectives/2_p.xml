<p>Natural products have long served as sources of therapeutic drugs and as a point of inspiration for researchers for the development and design of new drug candidates [

 <xref rid="B97-biomolecules-10-00817" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. In this sense, Ethnopharmacology-based approaches always have been a promising strategy in drug discovery. The present work is a starting point that summarizes, explains and exemplifies how Zoopharmacognosy and Zootherapy can meet this goal. Some of the most interesting mentioned compounds from Zoopharmacognosy are triterpene saponins present in genus

 <italic>Albizia,</italic> and naphthoquinones such as Mollugin and Rubioncolin C. Also, from Zootherapy origin, several steroids from amphibians and peptides from different mammals, reptiles and insects stand out. An excellent work that is an example of insect potential pointed out that there are at least 16 times as many insect species as there are plant species, yet plant chemistry has been studied 7000 times as much as insect chemistry when comparing the amount of research per species. Nonetheless, the vast biodiversity which exists in the arthropod world, compared to all other organisms on earth, certainly suggested that arthropods should be given a more serious look [
