<p>Amphibians venoms are rich in a wide range of chemical compounds including steroids (bufadienolides such as marinobufagin, telocinobufagine, bufalin), amines (like bufotenine), proteins, peptides and different classes of alkaloids [
 <xref rid="B82-biomolecules-10-00817" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. A recent study showed that the venoms of 
 <italic>Rhinella schneideri</italic> and 
 <italic>R. marina</italic> exhibit a strong tumor growth inhibition toward drug-sensitive CCFR-CEM and P-glycoprotein overexpressing CEM/ADR5000 leukemia cells. Moreover, 
 <italic>Venenum Bufonis</italic> (VB), a product of the secretions of 
 <italic>Bufo gargarizans</italic> Cantor and 
 <italic>B. melanostictus</italic> Schneider, which has been long used as Traditional Chinese Medicine exhibit antitumor, antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities in different types of cancer [
 <xref rid="B83-biomolecules-10-00817" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. It appears that these effects are mainly due to bufadienolides [
