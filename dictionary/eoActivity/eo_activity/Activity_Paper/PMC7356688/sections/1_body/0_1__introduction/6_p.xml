<p>Therefore, novel forms of treatment are seeking and have been purposed to overcome this problem, such as the use of hybrid combinations that consist of the association of anticancer drugs with bioactive phytochemical constituents of plant extracts [

Recently, it has been hypothesized that natural products, such as marine drugs, may deliver promising lead compounds for the development of collateral sensitive anticancer drugs. The phenomenon of collateral sensitivity consists of the hypersensitive to specific drugs by tumors with cross-resistance to numerous cytostatic drugs [

Although many hypotheses have been proposed, the mechanism of collateral sensitizing compounds remains unclear; nonetheless, they seem to be related to diverse biochemical mechanisms. A recent work assessed the ability of the macrocyclic diterpene plant derivatives as collateral sensitizing compounds in human tumor gastric (EPG85-257), pancreatic (EPP85-181), and colon (HT-29) cell models (drug-sensitive and drug-resistant sublines) [
