<p>This resistance can be (a) intrinsic or (b) acquired, being the former caused by pre-existing factors of the tumor that are present before any treatment administered, making consequently certain treatments useless at non-toxic doses. The latter appears to be a relatively common issue throughout the administration of treatment and seems to be the main perpetrator of treatment failure in cancer patients, usually after a relapse. Increasing evidence demonstrates that cells with acquired resistance to a specific drug are prone to exhibit cross-resistance to other chemotherapeutics. This implies the existence of common mechanisms of resistance, which may be independent of the particular action of the chemotherapeutic agent. Importantly, clinical evidence shows that phenotypes of resistance can be reverted to a sensitive phenotype and suggests that cancer-associated genetic alterations are not the only players in resistance. Cancer treatments should target not only the resistance mechanisms already present in the bulk of cancer cells but also those activated in CSCs [
