<p>Specifically, Mollugin, the major bioactive component isolated from 
 <italic>R. cordifolia</italic> roots acts in NF-κβ transcription factor, a major regulator of the immune response, which is associated with the development and progression of cancer and inflammation. It has been proven that, on the one hand, Mollugin inhibited the expression of NF-κβ reported gen that potentiated TNF-α, a factor that induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in inhibiting proliferation of HeLa cells [

Also, it was evidenced that Mollugin induces apoptosis in oral squamous cell carcinoma cells through NF-κβ/MAPK/Nrf2/HO1-signalling pathway. HO-1 is overexpressed in various types of cancer and is further induced by radiation and chemotherapy. Regarding the mechanisms of HO-1 induction, several studies have suggested the involvement of ERK/p38MAPK and NF-κB pathways, as well as nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) [
