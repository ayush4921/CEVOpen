<p>Emerging evidence suggests ruminants can self-medicate against gastrointestinal parasites by increasing consumption of antiparasitic plant secondary metabolites pharmacologically active, since this selective feeding improves their health and fitness, as it was reviewed by Villalba et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-biomolecules-10-00817" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. One specific example was the work of Lisonbee et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-biomolecules-10-00817" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], that showed parasite lambs ate more tannin-containing plants such as the species 
 <italic>Hedysarum coronarium</italic> L. and 
 <italic>Lespedeza cuneata</italic> (Dum.Cours.) G.Don, than lambs without parasites when parasite burdens were high. However, differences became smaller and disappeared toward the end of the study when the amount of parasite decreased [
