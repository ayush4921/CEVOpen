<p>Another case is the uncommon ingestion of 
 <italic>Albizia grandibracteata</italic> Taub. leaves and bark roots by chimpanzees that showed intestinal problems. Both extracts possess anthelmintic activities revealed by phytochemical studies that also showed the highly significative cytotoxic activity of bark roots extracts justified by the presence of saponosides in high quantities [
