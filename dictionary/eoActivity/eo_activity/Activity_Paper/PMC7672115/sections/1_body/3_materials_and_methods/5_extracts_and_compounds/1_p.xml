<p id="Par26">The air-dried and finely powdered rhizomes of 
 <italic>B. rotunda</italic> (2.5 kg) were percolated with 95% EtOH (6 L, 4 times × 7 days) at room temperature to give a crude EtOH extract (190.5 g) after solvent removal. The obtained EtOH extract was divided into two portions. Each portion was separated by VLC over Si-gel (250 g each, Merck Art. No. 7731), packing on a sintered glass funnel (i.d. 12.5 cm × packing height 4.5 cm), using EtOAc-hexanes and MeOH-EtOAc gradients as eluents, respectively. Fractions (500 mL each) were collected and combined based on their TLC behaviors to give frs. A
