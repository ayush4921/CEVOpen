<p id="Par12">Among 122 of the crude extracts and purified compounds derived from Thai natural products that were initially screened in this study, we reported panduratin A, a phytochemical compound derived from 
 <italic>B. rotunda</italic>, as the most potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent. To prove its efficacy in the major target cells in human, Calu-3, human airway epithelial cell line, was used in the high-content imaging procedure. In the preliminary study, we evaluated that Calu-3 cells were susceptible and permissive to SARS-CoV-2, similar to Vero E6. The infectivity in Calu-3 was almost reached 100% with the high numbers of the infectious virions produced, approximately 10
 <sup>7</sup> PFU/mL at 48 h post-infection (data not shown). In post-treatment approach, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of panduratin A in Calu-3 cells was detected with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 2.04 μM (CC
 <sub>50</sub> = 43.92 μM) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a), in comparison to IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.81 μM (CC
 <sub>50</sub> = 14.71 μM) obtained in Vero E6 cells (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>h and 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e). Analysis of the infectious virion production by plaque assay also confirmed viral suppression upon panduratin A treatment (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.53 μM) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). Additionally, in this experiment we used remdesivir as the therapeutic control at post-infectious phase (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). From the high-content imaging analysis, remdesivir exhibited the strong antiviral effect in Calu-3 with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.043 μM (CC
 <sub>50</sub> = 16.02 μM). Consistent result was observed through the analysis of viral output by plaque assay (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d) that showed IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.086 μM upon remdesivir treatment. Accordingly, this experiment confirmed the potency of panduratin A in human airway epithelial cells, which suggested the efficacy of this compound as the novel natural product-derived agent against SARS-CoV-2.
