 <italic>B. rotunda</italic> extract and panduratin A had very potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities in the post-infection phase. To extend this impact, it was interesting to know whether 
 <italic>B. rotunda</italic> extract and panduratin A also interfere with the viral entry. Pre-entry treatment was carried out to address this issue (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). In this procedure, 
 <italic>B. rotunda</italic> extract and panduratin A were pre-incubated with SARS-CoV-2 at 37 °C for 1 h before inoculation into Vero E6 cells. Viral adsorption was allowed for 2 h in the presence of the extract/compound. Then, the cells were washed by fresh medium to remove both the unbound viral particles and the extract/compound. Fresh medium was supplemented and the cells were further cultured for 48 h before harvest (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). Hydroxychloroquine (at the IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 8.07 µM for pre-entry treatment; details in Supplementary Fig. 1) and the neutralizing serum were used as the control to validate the feasibility and interpretability of the pre-entry treatment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). Interestingly, 
 <italic>B. rotunda</italic> extract and panduratin A also exhibited anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities in the pre-entry phase. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 
 <italic>B. rotunda</italic> extract and panduratin A were 20.42 µg/mL (CC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 100 µg/mL) and 5.30 µM (CC
 <sub>50</sub> = 43.47 µM), respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c,d). Even though it was less effective than that of post-infection condition, viral output analysis demonstrated approximately five-fold reduction of the infectious virion production following treatment with 
 <italic>B. rotunda</italic> extract (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e). Again, panduratin A absolutely suppressed the infectious virion production at a high dose of 50 μM (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>f).
