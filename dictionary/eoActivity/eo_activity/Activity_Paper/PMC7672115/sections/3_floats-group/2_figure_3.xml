   <bold>.</bold> (
   <bold>a</bold>) Study design. SARS-CoV-2 at 25TCID
   <sub>50</sub> were incubated with the extract/compound for 1 h before inoculation into Vero E6 cells. Viral adsorption was allowed for 2 h in the presence of the extract/compound. After washing, the culture was maintained in fresh media for 48 h before harvest. (
