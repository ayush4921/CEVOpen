<p>The HPLC-UV analysis of extracts of 
 <italic>R. farinacea, E. prunastri</italic>, and 
 <italic>P. furfuracea</italic> was used to identify their main phenolic acids by matching their retention times (
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>R</sub>) and absorbance maxima (nm) UV spectrum with the reference compounds. The chromatograms of eleven standards and extract samples are given in Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>. The structures of the identified molecules are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The obtained data confirmed that the main compounds in extracts of 
 <italic>P. furfuracea</italic> were physodalic acid (PHY), atranorin (ATR), and chloratranorin (CHL). PHY was the most abundant substance. Evernic acid (EVE), usnic acid (USN), atranorin (ATR), and chloratranorin (CHL) were identified, with EVE being the most abundant compound in 
 <italic>E. prunastri</italic>. Protocetraric acid (PRO), fumarprotocetraric acid (FUM), EVE, USN, and ATR were identified, with PRO being the predominant phenolic compound in 
 <italic>R. farinacea</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).
