<p>HPLC-UV analysis was performed according to the method adopted by Huneck and Yoshimura [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Extracts were solubilized in acetone (500 
 <italic>μ</italic>L), and the analysis was performed using HPLC (Agilent Technologies, 1200 Series). An injection volume of 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of the extract was analyzed using a mobile phase consisting of methanol-water-phosphoric acid in the presence of a detector of UV spectrophotometer (254 nm). Deionized water was purified using a purification system (Milli-Q.). HPLC-grade methanol was purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). The identification of polyphenolic compounds contained in extracts was carried out by comparing retention times (
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>R</sub>) and absorption spectra (200–400 nm) with those of the authentic substances isolated early from other lichen species. Previous studies have shown that the three tested lichens contain certain phenolic acids (evernic acid, fumarprotocetraric acid, atranorin, usnic acid, physodalic acid, chloroatranorin, and protocetraric acid), and that is why we chose them to be used as reference compounds. The standards used in this study were acquired from the following sources: evernic acid and atranorin are isolated from the

 <italic>Hypogymnia physodes</italic> [
