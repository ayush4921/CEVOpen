<p>Total phenolic content (TPC) in extracts was meticulously assessed using the Folin–Ciocalteu method [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], with some modifications. Briefly, 100 
 <italic>µ</italic>L of extracts (1 mg/mL) was diluted up to 4.6 mL and then added to100 
 <italic>µ</italic>L of the reagent of Folin–Ciocalteu. Afterward, the mixture was left for 3 min and then added to Na
