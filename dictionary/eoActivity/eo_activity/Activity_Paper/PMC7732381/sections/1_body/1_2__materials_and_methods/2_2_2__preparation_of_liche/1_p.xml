<p>Thalli of three lichen species were dried and ground into a fine powder. The powder was extracted by maceration (24 h) using acetone at ambient temperature [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Extracts of species were filtered then concentrated at 40°C under reduced pressure. The extraction yield obtained 4.52%, 1.32%, and 4.32% for 
 <italic>P. furfuracea, R. farinacea</italic>, and 
 <italic>E. prunastri</italic> extracts, respectively. The extracts obtained were kept at −20°C until further analysis.
