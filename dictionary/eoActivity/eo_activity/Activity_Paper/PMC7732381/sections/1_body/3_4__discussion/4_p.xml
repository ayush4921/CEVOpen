<p>Türka The antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>R. farinacea</italic>, 
 <italic>P. furfuracea</italic>, and 
 <italic>E. prunastri</italic> extracts was evaluated by the microdilution method against bacterial strains including clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. The results relieved that all extracts exhibited a potent antibacterial effect vs. Gram-positive bacteria. However, no effect was observed for Gram-negative bacteria. These results are in harmony with those carried out by et al. [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and Tay et al. [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] that reported a great activity of 
 <italic>P. furfuracea</italic> and 
 <italic>R. farinacea</italic> against only Gram-positive bacteria, and they also found that physodic acid and (+)-usnic acid isolated from these species, respectively, were inactive against Gram-negative strains [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In recent a study, Gültekin and Özyiğitoğlu showed that acetone extract of 
 <italic>P. furfuracea</italic> had no inhibitory effect on Gram-negative bacteria [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]; also, Osmana et al. reported that only Gram-positive bacteria were susceptible to the acetone extract of 
 <italic>P. furfuracea</italic> and 
 <italic>Evernia divaricata</italic> [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In contrast, other studies showed that these species have presented antibacterial effects vs. both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with stronger inhibitory effects on Gram-positive bacteria [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The reason for these conflicting results may be due to variations in the genotype of the strains tested and the experimental conditions.
