<p>In the present research work, we examined chemical profiles and the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> cytotoxic, antioxidant, and antimicrobial activities of organic extract from Moroccan lichens, 
 <italic>R. farinacea, E. prunastri</italic> and 
 <italic>P. furfuracea</italic>. The studied extracts affirmed the presence of evernic acid, physodalic acid, and protocetraric acid as major phenolic compounds. The biological activities of evernic and protocetraric acids have been reported in previous studies, where they showed higher activity than the one obtained for our examined lichen extracts including the antioxidant effect by DPPH assay. Also, they were found to exhibit strong antimicrobial activity against different microorganisms and anticancer activity against various cell lines [
