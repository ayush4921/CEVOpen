<p>We assessed changes that were made during the reassessment of product information provided to healthcare professionals and patients. The antibiotic with the highest number of changes following the referral finalised in June 2020 was fosfomycin, where changes applied to all SmPC sections assessed in this study. In total, 17 indications were removed for fosfomycin (including community-acquired pneumonia, acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections in children and periprocedural prophylaxis). It should also be noted that the benefit–risk balance of fosfomycin for intramuscular use and fosfomycin 2 g granules for oral solution was considered negative.</p>
