<p>The section 4.4 on special warnings and precautions for use was updated/harmonised in all 15 referral procedures. For example, in order to mitigate the well-known risks of using vancomycin, warnings against the potential for systemic absorption, nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, drug integrations, development of drug-resistant bacteria and recommendations for regular monitoring of renal function were included. For colistin or colistimethate sodium, in addition to myasthenia gravis mentioned above, a warnings advising against concurrent administration of nephrotoxic and/or neurotoxic medicinal products were introduced as well as recommendations to perform regular monitoring of renal function, mentioning the potential correlation with cumulative dose and treatment duration. For fosfomycin, two warnings were included, one regarding the need for combination therapy to reduce the risk of emerging resistance and the second concerning the risk of hypernatraemia and the need to monitor sodium and potassium level because of the risk of sodium overload related to infusion of intravenous fosfomycin.</p>
