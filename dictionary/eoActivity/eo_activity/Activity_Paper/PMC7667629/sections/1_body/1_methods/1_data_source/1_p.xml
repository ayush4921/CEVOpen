<p>We performed a comprehensive analysis of the changes made for a number of antibiotics that went through Article 30 and Article 31 referral procedure between 2007 and June 2020. Publicly available information on regulatory procedures and assessment reports from the EC Union register of medicinal products [
 <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and the EMA database [
 <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] were used to identify products that went through Article 30 and 31 during the study period. The EC Union register contains, among others, the EC decisions with annexes after the referral procedures. For this study, we used Annex II that summarises scientific conclusions and grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisations. The study includes all antibiotics that were re-assessed between 2007 and 2020 as a part of the European strategy to support the prevention of AMR.
