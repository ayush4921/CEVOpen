<p id="Par24">The antimicrobial effects of some plants and their extracts are well known today [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]; the diversity of plant species is a valuable source for the search for new classes of antibiotics. These plants may proffer valuable alternative to address certain human and veterinary health challenges. It is in this perspective that the hydro-ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>Canarium schweinfurthii</italic> has been explored for its anti-salmonellal activity and its bioactive compounds. Several plants are traditionally used against human salmonellosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] and avian salmonellosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Plants with high anti-salmonellal potential that show promise for the control of avian salmonellosis include 
 <italic>Aloe secundiflora</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], 
 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> and 
 <italic>Scutellaria baicalensis</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and 
 <italic>Erica mannii</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Plant extracts as well as traditionally improved drugs are one of the promising ways to combat human salmonellosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Several authors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] have shown that plant extracts depending on their concentrations are active both in vitro and in vivo against several 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> serotypes. Most of these extracts treat salmonellosis in the same range of time as conventional medicines. These findings corroborate our results which showed that the hydroethanolic extract of 
 <italic>Canarium schweinfurthii</italic> is active against 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> serotypes with MIC range from 64 to 128 μg/ml, moreover this extract have previously demonstrated an in vivo anti-salmonellal activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], curing avian salmonellosis on day 9 and with the doses 19 and 75 mg/kg bw of the extract. In addition to the therapeutic efficacy of the hydroethanolic extract of 
 <italic>Canarium schweinfurthii</italic>, the antibacterial activity of its partitions was evaluated. Among the partitions, chloroform and ethyl acetate fractions showed the best anti-salmonellal activity. It also appears that the activity of isolated compounds is greater than those of the crude extract and partitions. This could be due to the low concentration of these compounds in the plant extract or to the antagonism effect of other compounds present in the same extract. The anti-salmonellal activity of plants is linked to the diversity and complexity of their secondary metabolites. The in vitro anti-salmonellal effect of hydroethanolic extract of 
 <italic>Canarium schweinfurthii</italic> found in this study and its therapeutic efficacy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] can be linked to a combined action of its secondary metabolites. Indeed, at the molecular level, compounds such as gallic acid and scopoletin found in plants belonging to 
 <italic>Canarium</italic> genus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] could act synergistically and could be partly responsible for the anti-infectious activity of 
 <italic>Canarium schweinfurthii</italic>. In order to verify this possibility and to have a clear idea on the active principles of this plant, the fractionation of its stem bark extract was performed.
