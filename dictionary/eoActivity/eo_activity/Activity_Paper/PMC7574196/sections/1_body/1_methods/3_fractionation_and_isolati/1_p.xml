<p id="Par10">The profiling of the hydro-ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>Canarium schweinfurthii</italic> on TLC plates with several solvent systems showed no promising separation. In order to facilitate isolation, 260 g of extract was dissolved in distilled water (700 mL) and successively extracted with hexane (500 mL × 2), chloroform (500 mL × 2), ethyl acetate (500 mL × 2) and 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol (500 mL × 2) yielding respectively 5.56 g, 25.97 g, 25.92 g and 90.89 g of fractions after evaporation to dryness. These partition fractions were explored for their antibacterial activity and only the most active fractions were selected for the isolation of bioactive principles. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> below shows the protocol for isolating the bioactive principles of 
 <italic>Canarium schweinfurthii</italic>.
