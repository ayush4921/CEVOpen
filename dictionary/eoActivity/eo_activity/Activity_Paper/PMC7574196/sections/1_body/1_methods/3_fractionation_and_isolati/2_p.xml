<p id="Par11">Part of Chloroform fraction (23 g) was subjected to silica gel column chromatography using 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane-EtOAc (85:15 → 00:100) and MeOH, gradient elution. 40 sub-fractions of 100 mL each were collected and combined on the basis of their TLC profiles to give 5 fractions: A (1–3), B (4–12), C (13–22), D (23–25) and E (25–40). Sub-fraction A (4.5 g) was purified on silica gel column chromatography eluted with 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane-EtOAc (95:5 → 80:20) to give compound 
 <bold>1</bold> (42 mg). The purification of sub-fraction D (4 g) on silica gel column chromatography using 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane-EtOAc (70:30 → 20:80) afforded compound 
 <bold>2</bold> (57 mg) which was recrystallized in EtOAc-MeOH (20:80).
