<p id="Par7">Reagents which include ammonium cerium sulphate, were of analytical grade. Solvents were distilled before being used (St Louis, MO, USA). Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) was performed on pre-coated silica gel with thickness 0.20 mm 60 F
 <sub>254</sub> plates (MerckKGaA, Germany) and viewed under the UV light (254 and 365 nm). NMR analyses which included 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR, 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR, DEPT 90, DEPT 135, 2D NMR (COSY, HSQC), NOESY and ROESY were performed using deuterated solvents (Acétone-
