<p id="Par6">Resistance of 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> to commonly used antimicrobial agents is increasing both in the veterinary and public health sectors and has emerged as a global health challenge. Several 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> serotypes are multidrug resistant, and there is evidence of the spread of these strains from animals to humans. Antimicrobial resistance in NTS is considered one of the major public health threats related with food-animal production, as well as the poultry production chain and poultry meat, which is an additional concern in the management of salmonellosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Many authors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] have reported that several strains of 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> isolated from chicken have shown resistance to many antibiotics commonly used in human medicine and some of these strains have been found in humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Moreover, antibiotic residues in poultry products intended for consumption may lead to hypersensitivity or poisoning in consumers. Due to the growing awareness of resistance issues, the use of antibiotics is strongly discouraged in many countries whilst encouraging the use of plants as a better alternative due to their diverse nature of bioactive principles [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The large majority of salmonellosis in humans is carried by foodstuffs; mainly those of avian origin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], therefore controlling avian salmonellosis by using plant could significantly reduce the prevalence of human gastroenteritis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Several studies have focused on medicinal plants as new control strategies for human salmonellosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] or avian salmonellosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. But, to our knowledge, no phytomedicine has yet been formulated to control avian salmonellosis. 
 <italic>Canarium schweinfurthii</italic> Engl. (Burseraceae), is a tree with a cylindrical bole, native to tropical West Africa and grows to about 50 m high [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. This plant is mainly found in equatorial forest regions from Cameroon, Central African Republic, Gabon to Congo [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and is used in folk medicine for the treatment of various diseases including malaria, diarrhea and Typhoid fever [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Previous studies of Sokoudjou et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] showed that the hydroethanolic extracts of 
 <italic>Canarium schweinfurthii</italic> were active both in vitro and in vivo against several serotypes of 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic>. The objective of this work was to isolate, characterise the bioactive compounds of 
 <italic>Canarium schweinfurthii</italic>; and evaluate their anti-salmonellal activity.
