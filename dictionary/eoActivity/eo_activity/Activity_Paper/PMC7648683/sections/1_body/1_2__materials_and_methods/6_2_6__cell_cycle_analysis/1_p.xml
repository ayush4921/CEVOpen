<p>Cell cycle analysis was performed as described elsewhere [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Cells were seeded at 8 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells per well using a 6-well plate and incubated overnight at 37°C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. After treatment with each compound, the cells were incubated for 24 h. Cells were transferred to fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) tubes and centrifuged at 300 g for 5 min. Cell pellets were collected and resuspended in 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and centrifuged at 300 g for 5 min. Supernatant PBS was removed, and cell pellets were fixed by adding 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>L ice-cold 70% ethanol dropwise on ice for 15 min and collected again after being centrifuged at 300 g for 5 min. Supernatant ethanol was removed, and collected pellets were incubated with propidium iodide cell cycle solution in PBS (50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL propidium iodide, 0.1 mg/mL RNase A, and 0.05% Triton X-100) at room temperature for 1.5 h and analyzed with a Gallios flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). Data were analyzed using Kaluza v1.2 (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA).
