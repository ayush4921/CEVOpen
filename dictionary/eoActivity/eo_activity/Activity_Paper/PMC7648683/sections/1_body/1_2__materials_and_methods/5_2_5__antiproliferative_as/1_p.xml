<p>3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was carried out on A2780 cell lines as described elsewhere [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In brief, 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well were seeded into 96-well plates and incubated overnight at 37°C. Test samples were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and a 3-fold dilution series was prepared in 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of the cell medium, added to cells (in duplicates), and incubated for 72 h at 37°C. MTT was made up as a stock of 5 mg/mL in the cell medium, and the solution was filter-sterilized. Medium was removed from cells followed by washing with 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>L/well phosphate-buffered saline. MTT solution was then added at 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>L/well and incubated in the dark at 37°C for 4 h. MTT solution was removed, and cells were again washed with 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of PBS. MTT dye was solubilized with 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>L/well of DMSO with agitation. Absorbance was read at 540 nm using an EnVision multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer, Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, UK).
