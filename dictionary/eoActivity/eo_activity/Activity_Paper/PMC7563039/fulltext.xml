<italic>Clausena lansium</italic> (Lour.) Skeels (wampee) is an outstanding natural plant with medicinal properties. The aim of this study was to compare the cytoprotective effects of four parts of wampee under oxidative stress. The aqueous extracts of leaf, peel, pulp, and seed were tested for the proliferation effects on human gingival fibroblast (HGF) cells and the protective effects in the hydrogen peroxide-induced HGF model. Furthermore, the total glutathione assay and identification of rutin by high-performance liquid chromatography were carried out to attempt to determine whether the cytoprotective effects were related to the total glutathione (GSH) stability and rutin content. The results showed that all of the extracts had no cytotoxicity to HGF at tested concentrations ranging from 50 to 5000&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/ml during 24&#x02009;h, and the leaf, pulp, and seed extracts increased proliferation of HGF at relatively high concentrations. All the extracts except for the seed extract significantly decreased the production of reactive oxygen species, and the peel extracts exhibited the most effective antioxidant effect. The leaf extract had the highest anticytotoxicity and GSH stabilization effect in the HGF challenged with hydrogen peroxide. In addition, the relative content of rutin in peel and leaf extracts was higher than that in pulp and seed. The results of GSH assay and rutin identification suggest that different cellular protective effects among the four parts of wampee are partially related to the GSH stabilization and rutin content. These findings provide a scientific basis for the antioxidant effect-related biological activities of wampee extracts.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Natural Science Foundation of Hainan Province</funding-source><award-id>318QN251</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Natural Science Foundation of China</funding-source><award-id>51967006</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Hainan Provincial Scientific Research Projects in Colleges and Universities</funding-source><award-id>Hnky2019-59</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Scientific Research Foundation of Hainan Tropical Ocean University</funding-source><award-id>RHDXB201707</award-id><award-id>RHDXB201803</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Wound repair is a series of events involving multiple pathophysiological reactions, including inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and the antioxidant activity has an important role in the whole healing process. At the beginning of the inflammation stage, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are released into the surrounding environment by the stimulated neutrophils to protect the body against infection; however, when the ROS are present in an excess amount, for example, in the cases of aging, a stressful environment [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], or chronic inflammatory ailments [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], overproduced ROS may exhaust the endogenous antioxidants, such as glutathione (GSH), further speeding up the cellular aging process [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], which consequently results in impairing wound healing and tissue regeneration [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Antioxidant treatment can decrease the ROS accumulation to allow ROS to play a regulatory role in wound healing process effectively. Rutin, which is known as an antioxidant substance of plant origin, has been reported to be as a kind of supplement to promote wound healing [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>During the proliferative stage, fibroblast cells are the main players with the function to secrete growth factors and produce collagen, which is necessary for wound repair. Moreover, ascorbic acid, one of the representative antioxidants, increases collagen synthesis even in elderly fibroblasts [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], which may enhance the healing process by leading contraction of wound and reducing wound size. At the last remodeling stage, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play an important role in this phase. Topical antioxidant mixture was reported to downregulate MMP-9 to protect basement membranes [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Although the wound healing process of the oral mucosa is similar to that of skin, oral tissue is often threatened by bacterial infections and chewing stimulation due to the particular characteristics of oral environment. In addition, in the case of gingival graft surgery with significant tissue loss in the donor's palate, it is important to find some ingredients that enhance wound healing in the oral cavity. Based on the correlation between antioxidants and wound healing mentioned above, antioxidants seem to be a useful strategy for wound healing by removing the inflammatory cell-induced ROS [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>
<italic>Clausena lansium</italic> (Lour.) Skeels or its common name, wampee, belongs to the family Rutaceae, which is commonly distributed throughout Southern China, especially in the Hainan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian provinces and occasionally in India, Sri Lanka, and the United States (Hawaii and Florida) [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The fruit of wampee ripens from May to July with a similar appearance to grape. The fruit of wampee can be eaten directly or served in preserves and even cooked with meat [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The leaves, peel, bark, and pulp of wampee can also be used as a traditional medicine to treat diverse ailments, including asthma, cough, bronchitis, viral hepatitis, and dermatological and gastrointestinal diseases in folkloric systems in different regions [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], which might be contributed by the bioactive phytochemical constituents such as amides, flavonoids, coumarins, lactams, carbazole alkaloids, and even the volatile components in the roots, seeds, fruits, stems, and leaves of wampee [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Recently, studies on wampee have given more attention to its bioactive benefits, and antioxidant activity was one of them. The studies on the antioxidant activity used mostly wampee extracts of organic solvents [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and little is known about the comparison of cellular antioxidant activities among the aqueous extracts of different wampee parts. Therefore, the aims of this paper were to compare the cytoprotective effects among the pulp, seed, leaf, and peel aqueous extracts of wampee in human gingival fibroblast (HGF) cells under oxidative stress and to monitor the effect of the wampee extracts on promoting oral wound healing for further in vitro and vivo studies.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2.

Results</title><sec id="sec3.1"><title>3.1. Effects of the Different Wampee Extracts on Cell Viability and Proliferation</title><p>To investigate whether the aqueous extracts of the different wampee parts influenced the cell viability, HGF cells were exposed to the aqueous extracts at different concentrations (50, 100, 500, 1000, and 5000&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL) for 24&#x02009;h, and then, the cell viability was measured by WST-8 assay. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, all of the aqueous extracts of wampee showed no cytotoxicity at concentrations ranging from 50 to 5000&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL. In addition, wampee seed extract at higher concentrations of 1000 and 5000&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL induced 27% and 23% increase in cell viability, respectively, compared to the control group. Therefore, we further explored the effect of the four extracts on HGF cell proliferation. The seed extract increased the cell proliferation at the 1000 and 5000&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL concentrations during the 48 and 72&#x02009;h treatment, similar to the trend during the 24&#x02009;h treatment, demonstrating the continuous effects of the seed extract on the HGF cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(b)</xref>). The pulp extract enhanced cell proliferation at 1000 and 5000&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL statistically significant during 48&#x02009;h compared to the medium-treated control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(a)</xref>).

The Cytoprotective Role of the Four Wampee Extracts against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-Induced Cytotoxicity</title><p>The four different wampee extracts effectively protected the HGF cells against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced cytotoxicity. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(b)</xref>, compared with the pulp and peel extract groups, the cytoprotective effect was significantly demonstrated in the seed and leaf extract groups at a concentration of 0.5&#x02009;mg/mL, for which about 59% and 98% of the cells were recovered, respectively. At 5&#x02009;mg/mL, the seed and peel extract treated groups were fully recovered, and about 71% and 95% of the cells were recovered in the pulp and leaf extract group, respectively.</p><p>The cytoskeleton has an important role in maintaining the cell morphology and in migration. F-actin was stained by phalloidin in HGF cells treated with the different wampee extracts and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated cells were mostly apoptotic, and F-actin staining was not performed compared to the control group. When combined with the different wampee extracts, F-actin staining showed that the cells recovered from the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced cytotoxicity. Especially in the leaf extract-treated group, the HGF cells had a normal morphology both in the 0.5 and 5&#x02009;mg/mL in combination with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><title>3.3. Antioxidant Effects</title><p>To investigate the antioxidant effects of the different wampee extracts, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced hydroxyl radicals were detected in wampee extract-treated cells by using DCFH, which can be oxidized to a highly fluorescent DCF by hydroxyl radicals [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Due to HGF's relative strong tolerance to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> shown in a previous study [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], a relative high concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (1&#x02009;mM) was used in the present study. The HGF cells were treated with the different wampee extracts and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in combination, and the peel extract prevented the increase in DCF fluorescence intensity significantly at 2&#x02009;h, while the pulp and leaf extracts suppressed the DCF fluorescence intensity at 3&#x02009;h. And there was no statistical significance in the attenuation of DCF fluorescence intensity in the HGF cells by seed extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.4"><title>3.4. Effects of the Different Wampee Extracts on the Intracellular GSH Level</title><p>Glutathione, which can directly scavenge ROS [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], plays an important role in the cytosolic redox system. Thus, we next determined the effects of four kinds of wampee extracts on the intracellular GSH. The amount of total glutathione in HGF cells was ordered as follows: leaf extract&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;peel extract&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;pulp extract&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;seed extract-treated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Especially, there was no significant difference between the leaf extract-treated group and normal control group. In addition, compared with the only H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated group, the decrease of glutathione was more mitigated in the other wampee extracts-treated groups. These results imply that the differences in the degree of GSH depletion was related to the protective effects of four extracts on the HGF cells against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress, especially for leaf extracts.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.5"><title>3.5. Rutin Identification among the Different Wampee Extracts</title><p>Retention time was used in the HPLC analysis to identify the rutin among the four kinds of the wampee extracts. The result showed that a similar chromatographic peak appeared at about 23.64&#x02009;min, and S/N ratios of all peaks were more than 3, which indicate that the four kinds of wampee extracts contain rutin. Based on peak area, the higher contents of rutin were demonstrated in peel (1.57%) and leaf (0.76%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>The redox system has an important role in the whole healing process, and an exogenous natural antioxidant would be a benefit for enhancing wound healing [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, in the present study, we observed the antioxidant effects of the aqueous extracts from the peel, pulp, seed, and leaf of wampee in a H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced HGF cell model. In addition, the use of aqueous extract can avoid the drawbacks of hydrophobic reagents such as curcumin, which has been reported to have poor aqueous solubility and permeability [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. As expected, we found that all of the aqueous extracts did not exhibit any cytotoxicity in HGF at the tested concentrations ranging from 50 to 5000&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL during 24&#x02009;h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>); furthermore, the leaf, pulp, and seed extracts increased the proliferation of HGF at relatively high concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), which is a potential useful aspect for wound healing [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>And then, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced cytotoxicity in HGF was examined. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is also the active ingredient in tooth bleaching agents [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], which has been reported to stimulate irritation, ulceration on the gums [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and toxic effects on human gingival fibroblasts [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Our previous study assessed the catalase activities among MC3T3-E1, human dental pulp cells, HGF, and L929 cells. The highest activity was detected in HGF cells, which explained the reason that HGF cells are more resistant to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced cytotoxicity than other cells, such as human pulp cells [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Thus, we used a relatively high concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the present study to assess the effects of wampee extracts on the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced HGF cell model. All extracts significantly attenuated the cytotoxicity generated by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and the greatest protective effect was obtained by the treatment with the leaf extract; moreover, the protective effects were in the following order: leaf extract&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;seed extract&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;peel extract&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;pulp extract. In addition, the F-actin staining, which is required for cell movement and changes in cell morphology, was consistent with the cell-protected effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The leaf extract maintained the cell morphology and actin staining similar to control cells at both 0.5 and 5&#x02009;mg/mL concentrations.</p><p>Because the four kinds of wampee extracts had a different cell protective ability against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced cytotoxicity, we thought that the antioxidant effect could be the reason for the difference; thus, ROS in treated cells was further examined for the four extracts. Among the ROS, the most lethal radical is a hydroxyl radical, which can be produced with transition metal ions such as iron and copper via the Fenton reaction [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Furthermore, DCFH can react directly with the hydroxyl radical but not superoxide or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. A fluorometric assay with (DCFH-DA) was used to detect hydroxyl radicals in the present study. As shown in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4(a)</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4(d)</xref>, the peel, pulp, and leaf extracts except for the seed extract decreased the hydroxyl radical production significantly when exposed to 1&#x02009;mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Especially the peel extract almost quenched the DFC fluorescence early on in the treatment time, while the leaf extract did not exert the highest antioxidant ability to deplete hydroxyl radicals. These results indicate that the hydroxyl radical has a limited role in the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced cytotoxicity, partially due to the limitation of the cytosolic labile ions [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Because previous studies have indicated that intracellular GSH has a central role in removing cellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in biological systems [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], we investigated whether the different cell protective abilities of wampee extracts against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced cytotoxicity positively correlated to the extent of maintaining intracellular glutathione. The differences in the degree of GSH depletion are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. All the extracts antagonized the downregulation of GSH compared to that in the only H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated group, which may resist an increase in the amount of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the mitochondria and by extension, protect the cells from oxidative stress. Specifically, the leaf extract stabilized the intracellular GSH to the normal level even in the presence of exogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which consistent with that the leaf extract has the greatest ability among the four extracts to help HGF survive against the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced cytotoxicity.</p><p>Zeng et al. demonstrated that flavonoids in the wampee fruit organic extract resulted in the free radical-scavenging and antioxidant activities [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and other previous study also showed that the scavenging of hydroxyl radicals may be due to the presence of hydrogen-donating flavonoids in extracts [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. As a flavonoid belonging to the flavonols, rutin is present plentifully in wampee fruits [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and is a hydrogen-donating antioxidant, which can scavenge free radicals [<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Thus, we further explored the rutin component of the four extracts. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, based on the peak area, the rutin in the peel extract represented the highest amount, which confirmed the correlation between the rutin and hydroxyl radical-scavenging activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In addition, the diversity of phytochemicals in leaf extracts is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. Based on our current results, the rutin might be a potential candidate, which plays some roles in the effect of wampee on the cell viability and resistance to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> oxidative stress.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>In this study, we found that the aqueous extracts of wampee had a positive effect on cell proliferation and a protective effect on HGF cells against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative environment to different degrees. Specifically, the leaf extract showed the highest anticytotoxicity and GSH stabilization effects on HGF challenged with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. In addition, the peel demonstrated the most effective activity of quenching the DFC fluorescence. Lastly, the leaf, pulp, and seed extracts demonstrated the potential to enhance the proliferation of HGF cells. The results throw a light for using wampee in wound healing, especially in oral environment. Since the leaf, peel, and seed of wampee are usually uneaten and treated as waste, utilization of them has particular advantages in economy benefit and environmental protection. Further research will be required to identify which kind of extracts could be useful in enhancing oral wound healing in in vitro and in vivo studies, and particular attention will be paid on wampee leaf and peel part to increase economic benefits.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by the Hainan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 318QN251), Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51967006), Hainan Provincial Scientific Research Projects in Colleges and Universities (No. Hnky2019-59), and Scientific Research Foundation of Hainan Tropical Ocean University (Nos.
