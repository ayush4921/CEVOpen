<p>In this study, we found that the aqueous extracts of wampee had a positive effect on cell proliferation and a protective effect on HGF cells against H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative environment to different degrees. Specifically, the leaf extract showed the highest anticytotoxicity and GSH stabilization effects on HGF challenged with H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>. In addition, the peel demonstrated the most effective activity of quenching the DFC fluorescence. Lastly, the leaf, pulp, and seed extracts demonstrated the potential to enhance the proliferation of HGF cells. The results throw a light for using wampee in wound healing, especially in oral environment. Since the leaf, peel, and seed of wampee are usually uneaten and treated as waste, utilization of them has particular advantages in economy benefit and environmental protection. Further research will be required to identify which kind of extracts could be useful in enhancing oral wound healing in in vitro and in vivo studies, and particular attention will be paid on wampee leaf and peel part to increase economic benefits.
