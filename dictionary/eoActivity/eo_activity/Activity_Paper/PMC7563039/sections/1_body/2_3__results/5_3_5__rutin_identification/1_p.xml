<p>Retention time was used in the HPLC analysis to identify the rutin among the four kinds of the wampee extracts. The result showed that a similar chromatographic peak appeared at about 23.64â€‰min, and S/N ratios of all peaks were more than 3, which indicate that the four kinds of wampee extracts contain rutin. Based on peak area, the higher contents of rutin were demonstrated in peel (1.57%) and leaf (0.76%) (
