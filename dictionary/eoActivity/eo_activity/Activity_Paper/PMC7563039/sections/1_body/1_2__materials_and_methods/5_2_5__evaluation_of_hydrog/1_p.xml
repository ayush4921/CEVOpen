<p>To examine the effects of the different wampee extracts on the hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) -induced cytotoxicity, HGF cells were exposed to a combination of different wampee extracts and H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (0.65 mM or 1 mM). Cells were treated with different wampee extracts at various concentrations (0, 500, and 5000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) and 0.65 mM H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> for 18 h. After incubation, the WST-8 assay was performed to determine the number of viable cells.
