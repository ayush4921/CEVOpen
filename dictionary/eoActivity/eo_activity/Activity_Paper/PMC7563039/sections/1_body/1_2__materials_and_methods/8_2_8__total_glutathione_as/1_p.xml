<p>HGF cells were seeded in 6 cm culture dishes at a density of 2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/dish and treated with the different wampee extracts (1000

 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (1 mM) for 3 h. Total GSH was measured using a glutathione assay kit (Beyotime, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were collected with a scraper and then precipitated by centrifugation. Protein remover 
 <italic>M</italic> reagent was added and then mixed well. The cells were lysed using four cycles of freeze-thawing and then centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min. The supernatant was mixed with the total GSH test mix buffer. A kinetic profile of the optical density at 405 nm was used to determine the glutathione of the samples.
