<p>Srihari et al. in their interesting study investigated the anticancer activity of Kombucha, and therefore they found that Kombucha beverage could be an active agent for preventing the growth of metastasis in prostate cancer. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"> Figure 7(b)</xref> illustrated the antiproliferative effect of yarrow Kombucha products. Indeed, three distinct cell lines such as cell line obtained from murine fibroblast (L2OB), cell line derived from human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD), and cell line derived from human cervix carcinoma Hep2c (HeLa) were utilized in order to examine the anticancer effect of Kombucha and as a result, all the materials exhibited antitumor effect. Kombucha inoculum, used in their study, was fermentation liquid of Kombucha on yarrow infusion and subcritical water extract, and yarrow was chosen for introducing a novel substrate for Kombucha fermentation and therefore the following Kombucha beverages were produced: K–Y1.13, K–Y2.26, K-YI, K-YII, and K-YIII (they are in different weight percent) [
