<p>For example, in Vitas et al.'s study, they performed the fermentation process based on the temperature variations using optimization designs. They claimed that the temperature could be considered as the most critical factor during the fermentation process. Therefore, in the temperature ranges between 37°C and 42°C, the highest antioxidant performance can be achieved. Moreover, researchers concluded that, with increasing temperature, the amount of vitamin C and generated acids, as well as metabolites, were increased in obtained samples. The fermentation of Kombucha lasts commonly in the range of 7 to 60 days, and biological effects were enhanced within this process. However, desirable results have been obtained in about 15 days [

 <sub>2</sub> can start to be accumulated at the junction of the broth and biofilm. This may close the transfer of the nutrients and leads to an unusable environment [

Reiss informed that a fruit-like refreshing beverage was attained in the ranges of 6 to 10 days of the fermentation period, contrary to the vinegar taste that is obtained in the higher duration. Based on the Food and Drug Administration model food code for Kombucha brewing considering human consumption, more than 10 days of fermentation is not proposed [
