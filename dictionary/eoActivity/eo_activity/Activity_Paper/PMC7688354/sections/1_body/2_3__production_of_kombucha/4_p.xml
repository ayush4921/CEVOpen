<p>The results exhibited that AAB, more abundant in the biofilm than in the liquid broth, reached equilibrium after eight days, contrary to yeast species that seemed to be stable completely in both phases throughout the fermentation process. Some researchers estimated the amount of polyphenol and the antioxidant activity of Kombucha during its fermentation period (0, 7, 14, and 21 days) and demonstrated a high tendency to increase especially after the 7th day, which can be because of the more microbial variety obtained by that time [
