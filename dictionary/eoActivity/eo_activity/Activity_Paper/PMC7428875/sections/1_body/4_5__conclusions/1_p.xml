<p>The results of this study have revealed that the seven varieties of 
 <italic>Ficus deltoidea</italic> leaf extracts inhibited the formation of AGEs, decreased the levels of fructosamine, increased thiol group levels, and retarded the formation of protein carbonyl. The 
 <italic>Ficus deltoidea</italic> extracts also contained phenolic compounds and possessed antioxidant activities. However, further studies need to be done to identify the active biological constituents of 
 <italic>Ficus deltoidea</italic> that are involved in its activities.
