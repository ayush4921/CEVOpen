<p>The determination of phenolic content in the extracts was discovered using the Folin–Ciocalteu method [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] with minor alterations. Firstly, 0.2 mL of crude extract (1 mg/mL) was added with 2.8 mL distilled water and mixed thoroughly with 0.5 mL of Folin–Ciocalteu reagent for 3 minutes. Next, 2.0 mL of 20% (w/v) sodium carbonate was added to the mixtures and left for one-hour incubation in the dark at room temperature. The absorbance was figured at 650 nm using a Multimode Plate Reader (Perkin Elmer, USA). The total phenolic contents were figured from the gallic acid standard curve and expressed as mg of gallic acid equivalent per gram (mg GAE/g).
