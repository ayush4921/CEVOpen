<p>The protein glycation inhibitory activity was done according to the method by Sharma et al. [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] with minor modifications. A mixture of 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of bovine serum albumin (BSA) at 10 mg/mL and 400 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of 500 mM fructose in 100 mM phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) was incubated in 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide at 37°C for 28 days followed by the addition of 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of plant extracts and quercetin (final concentration: 0.078–0.50 mg/mL). The reaction was terminated by adding 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of trichloroacetic acid (TCA), left at 4°C for 10 minutes followed by being centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 minutes, and dissolved with alkaline phosphate buffer saline (pH 10). The formation of fluorescent AGEs was measured using a Multimode plate reader (Perkin Elmer, USA) at an excitation wavelength of 355 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm.
