<p>The accumulation of AGEs is toxic to cells. As it leads to increased oxidative stress, it promotes various diabetic complexities such as neuropathy, cataract, retinopathy, and atherosclerosis [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Protein glycation and AGEs formation can cause serious damage and be fatal to various organs by triggering dysfunction of the heart, eyes, kidneys, nerves, blood vessels, and impaired wound healing [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Several efforts have been explored to minimize the interactions of AGEs such as by inhibiting AGEs formation, blocking the actions of AGEs, or breaking preexisting AGE cross-links, controlling the glycemic index, modifying dietary intake, and using antioxidants and anti-AGE agents [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The discovery of new antiglycation agents is vital, and an inhibitor to protein glycation is currently in demand [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Medicinal plants possess the ability to reduce protein glycation and retard the modification of the biological activity of a protein that contributes to degradation and conversion to advanced glycation end products [
