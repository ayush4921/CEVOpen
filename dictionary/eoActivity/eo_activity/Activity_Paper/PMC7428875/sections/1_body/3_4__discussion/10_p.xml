<p>The reducing power assay was employed to evaluate the potentiality of antioxidants to donate electrons [
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] and the presence of reducers caused an alteration of Fe
 <sup>3+</sup>/ferricyanide complex to the ferrous form. The color mixture altered from yellow to various shades of green and blue relying on the intensity of reducing the power of each aggregate. The reducing power activity was measured using a Multimode Plate Reader at 700 nm and an increase in absorbance indicated a stronger reductive capability [
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. In this study, the highest reducing power activity was found in FDI (0.24 ± 0.24 mg AAE/g) followed by FDK (0.21 ± 0.02 mg AAE/g), FDB (0.22 ± 0.06 mg AAE/g), FDT (0.11 ± 0.02 mg AAE/g), FDD (0.04 ± 0.02 mg AAE/g), FDM (0.04 ± 0.02 mg AAE/g), and FDA (0.02 ± 0.01 mg AAE/g). The standard curve of ascorbic acid (0.93 ± 0.03 mg AAE/g) was plotted to measure the reducing activity, and quercetin (0.57 ± 0.09 mg AAE/g) was used as the positive control. In previous studies, the reduction capability of 
 <italic>Ficus deltoidea</italic> extract was the highest in FDD followed by FDT and FDA [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], depicting the same trend as in the present findings. However, the results in the present study are in conflict with other studies by Mohd et al. [
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] where the reducing power was found to be the highest in FDD followed by FDI, FDK, FDT, FDB, FDA, and FDM.
