<p>The phenolic compounds are broadly distributed and are the most ubiquitous groups of secondary plant metabolites that result in beneficial effects on human health. Hakiman and Maziah [
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] reported that the antioxidant compounds found in 
 <italic>Ficus deltoidea</italic> leaf extract were known as a nonenzymatic antioxidant (polyphenol, phenolic acid, and flavonoid) and enzymatic antioxidant (ascorbate oxidase, peroxidase, catalase, and ascorbate peroxidase). The phenolic compounds classified as flavonoids (epicatechin, quercetin-3-rutinoside, quercetin 5,4â€²-di-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, myricetin, and naringenin) were detected in leaves and figs of aqueous
