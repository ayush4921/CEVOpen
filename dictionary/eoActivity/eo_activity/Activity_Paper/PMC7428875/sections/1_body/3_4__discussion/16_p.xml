<p>Our study also demonstrated that the antiglycation and antioxidant activities of 
 <italic>Ficus deltoidea</italic> varieties are in correlation with the total phenolic contents present in the extracts. It was suggested that the synergistic effects of phenolic compounds can be attributed to the antioxidant and antiglycation properties in plant extracts [

 <italic>Ficus deltoidea</italic> extracts are a significant source of natural antioxidants and their potential could be due to the phenolic contents. Since reactive oxygen species (ROS) are associated with the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases and diabetes, the free radical inhibitory activity of the plant extracts may be the reason behind their medicinal use in treating a number of disease conditions [
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Based on its antiglycation and antioxidant (DPPH) activity, FDK was suggested to be the most effective variety compared to others. FDT showed the highest inhibition of AGEs but depicted lower DPPH scavenging activity compared to FDK. Meanwhile, FDB had the highest DPPH scavenging effects but reduced antiglycation activity compared to FDK.
