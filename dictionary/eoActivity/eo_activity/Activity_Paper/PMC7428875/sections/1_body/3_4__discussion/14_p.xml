<p>A comparison of TPC to reducing power activity exhibited a strong correlation in FDM (
 <italic>r</italic> = 1) followed by FDT (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.60). Meanwhile, a weak correlation was noted in FDK (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.46) and FDB (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.36). There was a negative correlation between the assays for FDA (
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.31), FDI (
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.66), and FDD (
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.69), respectively. Researchers [
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] have claimed that a high correlation of TPC and reducing power activity was found in 
 <italic>Ficus deltoidea</italic> extracts. In the present study's findings, positive correlations were seen in TPC, DPPH, and reducing power activity, thus indicating a significant contribution of phenolic compounds to both antioxidant assays. It was reported that correlation studies between total phenolic content and free radical scavenging activities of the plant extracts discovered a positive correlation between plant phenolics content and antioxidant activity [
