<p>The level of protein thiol groups has subsided after 28 days of fructose and BSA incubation. However, a substantial increase in the level of thiol groups was recorded when 
 <italic>Ficus deltoidea</italic> extracts and quercetin (0.078–0.50 mg/mL) were added to the glycated BSA fructose. The percentage of the prevention of thiol groups was found highest in quercetin (86.1%) followed by FDD (83.7%), FDT (76.9%), FDI (74.3%), FDA (73.0%), FDK (67.0%), FDM (65.1%), and FDB (64.3%), respectively, at 0.50 mg/mL concentration when compared to the control. After 28 days of incubation, the results showed that the seven varieties of 
 <italic>Ficus deltoidea</italic> extracts significantly inhibited the reduction of protein thiol groups. During the glycation and glycoxidation processes, a reactive oxygen species was produced and oxidized with amino acid residues to form carbonyl derivatives and reduced an oxidative defense of protein by depletion of thiol groups, thus leading to the damage of the cellular proteins [

The mechanisms underlie antiglycation activity that has been suggested to break the inter- and intramolecular cross-linkages in the AGEs formation, inhibit the development of carbonyl or dicarbonyl groups in reducing sugars, Schiff bases, or Amadori compounds, and finally prevent the oxidative and nonoxidative cleavage of late-stage Amadori products [
