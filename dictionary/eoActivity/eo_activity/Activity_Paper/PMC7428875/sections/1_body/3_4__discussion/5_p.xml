<p>Other than significantly increasing the levels of fructosamine when added to the fructose-BSA system, the 
 <italic>Ficus deltoidea</italic> extracts also suppressed the protein carbonyl content and elevated the levels of protein thiol. In this study, the inhibition of protein carbonyl formation in the seven 
 <italic>Ficus deltoidea</italic> varieties was observed. After 28 days of incubation, the carbonyl content of glycated BSA-fructose had increased. However, when treated with 
 <italic>Ficus deltoidea</italic> extracts, the protein carbonyl content was significantly suppressed. The inhibition of protein carbonyl content was found highest in FDT (1.76; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) followed by FDK (1.74; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), FDI (1.53; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), FDB (1.48; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), FDA (1.41; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), FDD (1.38; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and FDM (1.36; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) by fold, respectively, when compared with the control at 28 days of incubation. Quercetin was used as a positive control to show 3.04-fold of inhibition (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) at a 5.0 mg/mL concentration.
