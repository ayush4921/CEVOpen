 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, the highest total phenolic content in 
 <italic>Ficus deltoidea</italic> extracts was found in FDB (299.78 ± 5.85 mg GAE/g) followed by FDI (190.30 ± 3.08 mg GAE/g), FDK (180.47 ± 3.25 mg GAE/g), FDT (163.28 ± 7.83 mg GAE/g), FDD (103.84 ± 5.93 mg GAE/g), FDM (78.44 ± 2.88 mg GAE/g), and FDA (70.90 ± 3.32 mg GAE/g). Quercetin was used as a standard reference and exhibited 1297.94 ± 17.66 mg GAE/g. The amount of phenolic contents was measured according to the standard curve of gallic acid (mg GAE/g).
