<p>The effects of 
 <italic>Ficus deltoidea</italic> varieties on glycation-induced oxidation of protein thiol are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. After 28 days of incubation, the levels of thiol group were depleted in fructose-glycated BSA. However, when incubated with 
 <italic>Ficus deltoidea</italic> varieties and quercetin (0.078–0.50 mg/ml), there was a significant increment of the thiol group levels in the system. The results showed that after 28 days of incubation, the highest percentage of inhibition of thiol group was found significantly in quercetin (86.1%;
