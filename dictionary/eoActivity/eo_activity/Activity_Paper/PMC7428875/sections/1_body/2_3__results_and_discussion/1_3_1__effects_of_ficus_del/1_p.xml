 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows the effects of 
 <italic>Ficus deltoidea</italic> varieties and quercetin on inhibition of AGEs formation. The inhibition of AGEs formation in fructose-glycated BSA was observed at 14 and 28 days and showed a significant increase in percentage inhibition of AGEs formation. Each value corresponds to the mean ± SD (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6). The results showed that 
 <italic>Ficus deltoidea</italic> varieties and quercetin (0.078–0.50 mg/mL) significantly reduced the formation of AGEs in a concentration-dependent manner. A significant inhibition of the formation of AGEs was observed highest in quercetin at a concentration of 0.078, 0.125, and 0.50 mg/mL which evoked 2.85- (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), 8.13- (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and 12.27- (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) fold of inhibition, respectively, compared to the control at 14 days. At 28 days, the same trend was observed with 3.09-, 4.81-, and 5.78-fold of inhibition (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).
