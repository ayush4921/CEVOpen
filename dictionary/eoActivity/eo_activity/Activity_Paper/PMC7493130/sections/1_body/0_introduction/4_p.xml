 <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] reported the effect of the plant extract in yankasa sheep while Jigam et al., [
 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] reported the acute toxicity of the plant extract in mice using intraperitoneally (i.p) route. However, there is limited published data about its safety and systemic evaluation at high doses of the plant using the oral route, thus its safety profile is needed. In this study, acute and sub-chronic evaluation of the different parts of 
 <italic>Diospyros mespiliformis</italic> was conducted in Wistar rats
