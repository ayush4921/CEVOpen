  <p>Body weights, liver weights, and biochemical indicators in the serum. Body weights were measured twice per week until day 21 (
   <bold>a</bold>). Liver weights were measured immediately after the mice were sacrificed; the liver weight/body weight ratio of each mouse is presented (
   <bold>b</bold>). The serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (
   <bold>c</bold>), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (
   <bold>d</bold>), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (
   <bold>e</bold>), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), triglyceride (
   <bold>g</bold>), and total cholesterol (
   <bold>h</bold>), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) (
   <bold>i</bold>), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) (
   <bold>j</bold>) levels were measured. All data are presented as the mean ± SEM. One-way ANOVA and Duncan’s multiple range test were conducted. Different superscripts within groups indicate significant differences at
