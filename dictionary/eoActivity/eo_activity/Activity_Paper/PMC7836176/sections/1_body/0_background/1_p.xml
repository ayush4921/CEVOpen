<p id="Par38">Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasingly becoming a worldwide health issue owing to the burgeoning cases of obesity in the global population. In developed countries, almost one third of adults have NAFLD, and its incidence among adolescents is also increasing [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. NAFLD is an umbrella term that represents diseases ranging from fatty liver to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), where the disorder can progress to cirrhosis and liver cancer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. NAFLD onset is caused by lipid droplet accumulation in the liver, which is mainly attributed to excess food consumption because the liver is a primary organ of de novo lipid synthesis. Hepatocytes produce triglycerides (TGs) and release lipids to the portal vein in the form of very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Although NASH development has been associated with inflammation caused by oxidative stress from excess lipids stored in the liver, the underlying mechanisms of fatty liver remain to be solved [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. NASH can be distinguished from fatty liver based on the signs of inflammation, which can be accompanied with mild fibrosis. Continuous inflammatory reactions cause the loss of severely damaged hepatocytes, which are then superseded with fibrocytes [
