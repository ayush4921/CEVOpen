<p id="Par57">Substantial evidence indicates that TGFβ and Smad-dependent downstream signaling are key regulatory factors in liver fibrosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. TGFβ receptor activation causes Smad2/3 phosphorylation and binding with Smad4, and this oligomer induces the transcription of fibrogenesis-related genes after it translocates to the nucleus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. TGFβ represents a predominant and central mediator of fibrosis in many organs in addition to the liver; therefore, it has been the target of therapeutic agents against fibrosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. These protein-expression changes resulted in diminished α-SMA expression, a final product. In addition, the LV extract also significantly decreased (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) the expression of MMP-2. The inactive form of TGFβ complexes with the latency TGF-binding protein (LTBP), and after dissociating from MMP-2, the active form of TGFβ can be released [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Hence, it is surmised that the LV extract can ameliorate liver fibrosis by regulating an MMP-2-related pathway, although further studies are needed to verify this mechanism.
