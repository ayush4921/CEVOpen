<p id="Par52">The MDA contents of liver tissues were analyzed for checking oxidative stress in the liver (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). The MDA content was significantly increased in the MCD group compared with that in the MCS group, whereas administration of GFT and LYS resulted in significantly decreased oxidative stress in the liver tissues (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The protein-expression levels of Nrf2 and HO-1 were significantly lower in the MCD group than in the MCS group (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b-d). In contrast, treatment with GFT505 and the LV extract increased the protein-expression levels of Nrf2 and HO-1. Oxidative stress in cell systems can lead to inflammatory responses. Therefore, we anticipated that the LV extract could reduce inflammatory reactions by protecting cells against reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced due to NASH. To determine the extent of the inflammatory signaling in NASH, the gene-expression levels of 
 <italic>MCP-1</italic> and 
 <italic>ICAM-1</italic> were determined (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e-f). Only the MCD group showed markedly higher expression levels of these two inflammation-related genes, whereas they were significantly downregulated by the LV extract and GFT505 (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).
