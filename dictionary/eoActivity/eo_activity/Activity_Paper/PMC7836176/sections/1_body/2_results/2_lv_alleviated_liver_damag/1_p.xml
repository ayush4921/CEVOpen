<p id="Par50">In contrast to the mice in the MCS group, mice in the MCD, GFT, and LYS groups all showed significantly reduced body weights (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). No significant difference in body weight was observed among the MCD diet-fed animals, with or without further treatment. However, mice in the positive-control group that was administered GFT505, showed significantly reduced liver weight/body weight ratios (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Liver damage induced by NASH was examined by quantifying the ALT, AST, LDH, and ALP levels (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c-f). All four enzyme were present at higher levels in the MCD group than in the MCS group, whereas AST, ALT, and ALP levels were significantly lower in the GFT and LYS groups (

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>g-j). This absence of changes in the serum TG and cholesterol levels in the MCD diet-fed
