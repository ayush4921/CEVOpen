<p>Coumarin compounds can inhibit the growth, proliferation and metastasis of various tumor cells through a variety of mechanisms, including inhibition of carbonic anhydrase, PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, microtubule polymerization, angiogenesis, monocarboxylate transporters, hypoxia-inducible factor-1; acting on apoptosis proteins and inhibiting tumor multidrug resistance, regulation ROS, and so on (
