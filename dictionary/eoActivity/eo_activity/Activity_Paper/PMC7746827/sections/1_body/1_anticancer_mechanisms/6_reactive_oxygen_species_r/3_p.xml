<p>On the other hand, excessive ROS production in cells can induce apoptosis. The ability of ROS to cause severe cell damage and cell death has been used as a way to kill cancer cells. Han evaluated the production of intracellular ROS by DCFH-DA staining. Compared with the control group, the production of ROS in human cervical cancer cells treated with Shikonin derivative PMMB232 was significantly increased (
