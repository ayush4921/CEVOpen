<p>Based on high affinity inhibitors, by means of molecular docking simulation and pharmacophore study, Tripathi (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) designed and synthesized a series of new coumarin derivatives, which can dock at active site cavity of P-gps, have a higher binding affinity to the target protein P-gp and can more effectively inhibit the efflux process, thereby enhancing the bioavailability of various anti-tumor drugs and reducing the growth of breast cancer stem cells.
