<p>MDR refers to the phenomenon of broad-spectrum drug resistance in tumors, an important cause of tumor recurrence. The main mechanism of MDR is that transmembrane proteins such as p-glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance-related protein 2 can transfer various anti-tumor drugs from the cytoplasm to the outside of the cells by using the energy from the hydrolysis of ATP. Studies have shown that coumarins can inhibit MDR by inhibiting P-gp or multidrug resistance-related protein 2.</p>
