<p>5-methoxypsoralen, also known as bergamot and parsley alkali, is a natural product of furocoumarins and usually isolated from psoralen. Guo (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) found that 5-methoxypsoralen inhibits the expression and phosphorylation of PI3K, Akt, and mTOR in human glioma cells, thereby completely down-regulating the expression and activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. 5-methoxypsoralen can also cause DNA damage by fragment the DNA of human glioma cells, and induce the appearance of autophagy vacuoles.
