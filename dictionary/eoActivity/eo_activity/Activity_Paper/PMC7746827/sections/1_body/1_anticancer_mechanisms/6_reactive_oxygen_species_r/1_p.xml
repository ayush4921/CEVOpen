<p>ROS is a type of natural by-products produced during cell metabolisms, such as superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, and peroxide hydrogen root, hydroxyl radical. In normal cells, medium and high concentrations of ROS are believed to be closely related to apoptosis caused by the cellular stress response, while low concentrations of ROS have a wide range of physiological significance, affecting some signaling pathways and activating transcription factors, and promoting cell proliferation and differentiation. In tumor cells, due to excessive metabolic activity and impaired mitochondrial function, ROS levels are much higher. In addition, ROS is required for tumorigenesis, tumor cell survival, proliferation, and metastasis (
