<p>Nordin (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) isolated a coumarin derivative PulchrinA that connected a long alkyl on the coumarin heterocyclic ring from natural product Enicosanthellum pulchrum for the first time and investigated the ability to initiate apoptosis in human ovarian cancer cells. The results showed that Pulchrin A induced the down-regulation of Bcl-2 protein and the up-regulation of Bax protein by activating caspase-3 and caspase-9, inducing strong cytotoxicity to ovarian cancer cells, and the IC50 value was 22 Î¼M.
