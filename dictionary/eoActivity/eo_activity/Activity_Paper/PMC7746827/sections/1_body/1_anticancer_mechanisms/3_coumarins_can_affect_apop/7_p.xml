 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) treated three kinds of pancreatic cancer cell lines with esculetin, and found that the expression of caspase-3, -8, and -9, as well as the activation level and cleavage form in pancreatic cancer cell lines, were significantly increased. Esculetin can also cause the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in pancreatic cancer cells and increase the cytoplasmic level of cytochrome C, which in turn mediates the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9, leading to apoptosis.
