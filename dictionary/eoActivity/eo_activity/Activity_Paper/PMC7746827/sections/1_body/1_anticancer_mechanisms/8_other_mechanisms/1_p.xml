<p>Nrf2, which is strictly regulated by KEAP1, is an important anti-tumor factor and a major regulator of antioxidant reactions. It can bind to antioxidant reaction elements in the promoters of antioxidant proteins and activate the coding of these proteins (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). In tumor cells, KEAP1 sequesters Nrf2 in the cytoplasm and promotes its ubiquitination and proteasomes degradation (

In order to detect whether esculetin affects the regulation of the antioxidant reaction elements pathway, Arora treated pancreatic cancer cells with esculetin and detected the interaction between Nrf2 and KEAP1, and found that esculetin could directly bind to KEAP1, then destroying the interaction of Nrf2-KEAP1, releasing Nrf2 from the inhibition of KEAP1, increasing the amount of phosphorylation of Nrf2 in cells and increasing the expression of NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1), the direct target of Nrf2 (
