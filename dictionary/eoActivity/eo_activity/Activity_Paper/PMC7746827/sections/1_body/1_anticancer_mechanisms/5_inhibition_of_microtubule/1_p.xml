<p>Microtubules are the main components of the cytoskeleton and play an important role in maintaining cell morphology, cell division and proliferation, and signal material transportation. Clinically, antitumor drugs can inhibit the mitosis of tumor cells by promoting the depolymerization of microtubules or inhibiting their aggregation, so that the tumor cells can be stagnate in the M-phase. There are three drug binding sites on the microtubules, namely colchicine, vincristine, and paclitaxel binding sites. Colchicine, vincristine, and paclitaxel are also commonly used as microtubule inhibitors. In addition, colchicine, vincristine, and paclitaxel are transport substrates for P-gp pumps, so multi-drug resistance of tumor cells may occur.</p>
