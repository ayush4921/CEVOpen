<p>Based on the structure of Coumarin and sulfonamide, Belma (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) designed a series of compounds and tested their abilities to inhibit the expression of CA I, CA II, CA IX, and CA XII in colon cancer cells. They found that these compounds can effectively restrain the CA IX and CA XII expression. 4-((((2-((1-(3-((2-oxo-2h-chromen-7-yl)foxy)propyl)1h-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methoxy)naphthalen-1-yl)-methylene)amino) methyl) benzenesulfonamide (8i) exhibited the ability of selective inhibition of cell proliferation 
 <italic>via</italic> specific inhibition of CA IX and CA XII expression in human colon cancer cells with the Ki is 45.5nM and 596.6 nM, respectively. Belma (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) also synthesized 16 kinds of bis-coumarin derivatives (5a-5p) containing three thiazole rings and alkyl chains, and assessed their inhibitory activities against CA I, CA II, CA IX, and CA XII. They found that all synthetic compounds showed selective inhibitory activities against tumor-related CA IX and CA XII in the high nM range. Among them, 4-methyl-7-((1-(12-(2h-(2-oxo-chromen-7-yl)foxy)dodecyl)1h-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methoxy)-2h-chromen-2-one (5p) and 4-methyl-7-((1-(1-(2h-(2-oxo-chromen-7-yl) foxy) decyl)1h- 1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methoxy)-2h-chromen-2-one (5n) showed the highest CA XII and CA IX inhibition with the Ki is 144.6 71.5Â nM, respectively.
