<p>Musa (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) synthesized a series of 7,8-Diacetoxy-3-arylcoumarin derivatives (5a-h) and evaluated their cytotoxicity to human prostate (PC-3) and breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) cancer cell lines 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. 7,8-Diacetoxy-3-(4-methylsulfonyl phenyl) coumarin (5f) is the most active derivative and has the highest cytotoxicity and selectivity to PC-3 cell lines. 5f induced the up-regulated expression of apoptotic proteins such as caspases 3, caspases8, Bid, and Smac/DIABLO, and also induced PC-3 cells apoptosis by reducing mitochondrial membrane potential.
