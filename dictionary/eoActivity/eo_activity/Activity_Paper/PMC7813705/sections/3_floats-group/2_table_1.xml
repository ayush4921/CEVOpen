     <p>Adverse event</p>
     <p> Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment</p>
     <p> An adverse event can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (for example, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to this medicinal product</p>
    </td>

   <tr>
    <td align="left">
     <p>Adverse drug reaction</p>
     <p> A noxious and unintended response to a medicinal product where a causal relationship between a medicinal product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility</p>
     <p> A reaction, in contrast to an event, is characterised by the fact that a causal relationship between the drug and the occurrence is suspected. For regulatory reporting purposes, if an event is spontaneously reported, even if the relationship is unknown or unstated, it meets the definition of an adverse drug reaction</p>
