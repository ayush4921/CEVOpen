<p id="Par44">The IPVG also recommends using common terminology such as the terminology proposed by the CIOMS VIII working group [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] or EU-GVP Module IX [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] to avoid misunderstandings in reportability of signals to NRAs. The term “emerging safety issue” (ESI) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] should only be used for the most serious risks where an immediate in-market action is required to protect patients and public health.
