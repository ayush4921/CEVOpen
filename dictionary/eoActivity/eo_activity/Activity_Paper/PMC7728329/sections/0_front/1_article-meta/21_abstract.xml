 <p>Herein, we describe novel pentafluorosulfanyl (SF
  <sub>5</sub>) group-containing meta-diamide insecticides. For the facile preparation of the SF
  <sub>5</sub>-based compounds 
  <bold>4a</bold>–
  <bold>d</bold>, practical synthetic methods were applied. Among newly synthesized compounds, 3-benzamido-
  <italic>N</italic>-(2,6-dimethyl-4-(pentafluoro-λ
  <sup>6</sup>-sulfanyl)phenyl)-2-fluorobenzamide 
  <bold>4d</bold> showed (i) a high insecticidal activity, (ii) an excellent selectivity to insects, and (iii) good levels of water solubility and log P values. In this study, we demonstrated that the pentafluorosulfanyl moiety could serve as an attractive functionality for the discovery of a new scope of crop-protecting agents.
