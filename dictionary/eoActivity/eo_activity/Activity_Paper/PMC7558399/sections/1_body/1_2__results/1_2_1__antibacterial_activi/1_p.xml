<p>As far as the antibacterial activity of antibiotics against diarrheagenic strains is considered, ciprofloxacin and tetracycline exhibited strong growth-inhibitory effect (

 </inline-formula>-MIC = 16.5 ± 34 and 61.8 ± 141 μg/mL, respectively). Regarding the significant degree of variation between MICs of these compounds, particular types of pathogenic strains were highly susceptible while some other species were distinctly more resistant. For example, all gram-negative diarrheagenic bacteria were highly susceptible to ciprofloxacin (MICs = 0.016–0.125 μg/mL) and ceftriaxone (MICs = 0.062–0.5 μg/mL). In contrast, their MICs produced against gram-positive pathogens were comparably higher; for the former ranging from 1 to 16 μg/mL and for the latter in the range of 4–512 μg/mL. At least half of the diarrheagenic bacteria were inhibited at the low MICs (1–4 μg/mL) by chloramphenicol and tetracycline, whereas the variations were particularly caused by the weak activities revealed against 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> (MIC = 128 μg/mL) and 
 <italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic> (32 μg/mL), respectively. At the low concentration (MICs = 0.5 μg/mL), tetracycline also inhibited 
 <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> and 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus.</italic> Although metronidazole and vancomycin were generally inactive against diarrheagenic bacteria (

 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (0.062 μg/mL). The synthetic analogs of phytochemicals, namely, zinc pyrithione, nitroxoline, and chloroxine, exhibited strong to moderate growth-inhibitory activity against all diarrheagenic bacteria (

 <italic>B. cereus</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic>, and 
 <italic>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</italic> were highly susceptible to zinc pyrithione (MICs = 1–4 μg/mL). The MIC of chloroxine against both 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. difficile</italic> was 8 μg/mL. Nitroxoline exhibited strong growth-inhibitory activities (MICs = 2–4 μg/mL) against 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic>, clostridial species, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. flexneri</italic>. Although 8-hydroxyquinoline did not produce significant antibacterial activity against the pathogens (
