<p>The selective antibacterial activities against the pathogens with relatively lower activity against probiotic strains (SIb values range from 0.2–1.1) was revealed by most of the agents exhibiting strong to moderate inhibitory effects on diarrheagenic bacteria, namely: nitroxoline, zinc pyrithione, tetracycline, chloroxine, and ciprofloxacin. In contrast, chloramphenicol and ceftriaxone were more toxic to probiotic strains (SIbs = −0.4 for both). Although the antibacterial activity of berberine, ferron, phenolic compounds, and sanguinarine was in cases of both diarrheagenic and probiotic strains generally insignificant, the results show that these agents were rather toxic to the latter (SIb values range from −1 to −0.03). Due to the minor cytotoxicity revealed against FHs 74 Int, none of the antibiotics exhibited an increased toxicity to normal intestinal cells at the inhibitory concentrations active against diarrheagenic bacteria (SIa values = 0.2–1.8), especially ciprofloxacin and chloramphenicol. In contrast, all of the phytochemicals and their synthetic analogs revealed cytotoxicity to normal intestinal cells at the concentrations they were generally inactive against diarrheagenic bacteria (SIa values range from −1.9 to −0.7). Only 8-hydroxyquinoline (SIc = 1.1) and sanguinarine (SIc = 0.1) exhibited selective antiproliferative activity against cancer cells with the decreased cytotoxic effect on normal intestinal cells. Except these two, other tested compounds were more toxic to normal than to cancer intestinal cells (SIcs = from −1.5 to −0.3), or in the case of ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and vancomycin, they did not show any selectivity (SIcs = 0), as they did not inhibit cell lines at any concentration tested. The data on selective toxicities, including all calculated SI values are presented in
