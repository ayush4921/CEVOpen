<p>The growth-inhibitory activities of the test compounds against aerobic and anaerobic bacterial strains were evaluated by the broth microdilution method using 96-well microtiter plates, following the protocols of CLSI guidelines [
 <xref rid="B48-pharmaceuticals-13-00233" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and Hecht et al. [
 <xref rid="B49-pharmaceuticals-13-00233" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], respectively. Prior to testing, the strains were sub-cultured in the appropriate media at 37 °C for 24 h. Obligate anaerobes and lactobacilli were cultured for 48 h using Whitley A35 Anaerobic Workstation (Don Whitley Scientific, Bingley, UK). The anaerobic conditions were created by the supply of a standard anaerobic gas mixture of 10% H
 <sub>2</sub>, 10% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, and 80% N
 <sub>2</sub> (Linde Gas, Prague, Czech Republic). Test agents were diluted 2-fold in appropriate growth media using the Freedom EVO 100 automated pipetting platform (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland) or multichannel pipette (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) (initial concentration of 512 μg/mL). After the bacterial cultures reached an inoculum density of 1.5 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL by 0.5 McFarland standard using Densi-La-Meter II (Lachema, Brno, Czech Republic), the 96-well plates were inoculated (5 μL/well). The plates containing the volatile compound, 8-hydroxyquinoline, were covered using EVA capmats (Micronic, Lelystad, Netherlands) after inoculation to prevent evaporation [
 <xref rid="B50-pharmaceuticals-13-00233" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Bacterial cultures in microplates were incubated by employing the same protocols as used for their cultivation prior to the test. The optical density of the cultures was measured at 405 nm (OD
 <sub>450 nm</sub>) using a Cytation 3 Imaging Reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA) before and after the growth. The lowest concentration (μg/mL) of test compounds at which the bacterial growth was inhibited by ≥80% was defined as MIC. All tests were performed as three independent experiments each carried out in triplicate. The data are presented as median/mode. As a result of experiments performed without dissolved test compounds, DMSO and 96% ethanol (both from Sigma-Aldrich, Prague, Czech Republic) did not inhibit bacterial growth of any strain at the tested concentrations (≤1%).
