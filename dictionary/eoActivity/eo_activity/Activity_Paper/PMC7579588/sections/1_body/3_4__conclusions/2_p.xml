<p>According to our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluates the content of β-glucans by two methods, the Megazyme method and the Congo red method in 21 edible mushroom species including 18 wild mushroom species. We found that the highest content of β-glucans determined by the Megazyme method, among wild mushrooms, was in 
 <italic>Tricholoma portentosum</italic> (34.97 g/100 g DM), whereas β-glucans determined by the Congo red method in 
 <italic>Lactarius deliciosus</italic> (17.11 g/100 g DM) and 
 <italic>Suillus grevillei</italic> (16.97 g/100 g DM). This study found that wild mushrooms have a comparable or higher content of β-glucans compared to commercially grown species with proven medicinal properties, namely 
 <italic>Agaricus bisporus</italic>, 
 <italic>Lentinula edodes</italic> or 
 <italic>Pleurotus ostreatus</italic>.
