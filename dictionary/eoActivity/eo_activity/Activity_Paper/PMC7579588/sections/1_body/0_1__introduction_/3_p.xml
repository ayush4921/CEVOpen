<p>Beta-glucans are not synthesized by the human body; therefore, they are recognized by the immune system. The activity of mushroom beta-glucans may vary depending on the type of monomers that build the structure of these compounds, the size of the molecule, the degree of its branching and solubility in water, as well as the structure that beta-glucans form in the presence of water. Studies show that high molecular weight molecules with β-1-3- bonds in the backbone have the best anticancer properties [

In unaltered form, they pass into the small intestine, where they bind to macrophage Dectin-1 receptors in the intestinal wall and then are transported to the spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. In macrophages, high molecular weight β-glucans are degraded into smaller fragments, which are then bonded by Complement Receptors 3 (CR3) on immune system cells, including granulocytes. Thus, the immune response against cancer cells is stimulated [

The scientific reports to date attribute beta-glucans immunomodulating, anti-cancerogenic, hypolipemic, hypoglycemic and protective properties to the circulatory system [

Although, many of health promoting activities are connected to their effect on immune system, this property seems to be related to their ability to reduce cholesterol absorption and to scavenge bile acids [
