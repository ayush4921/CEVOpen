<p>The content of beta-glucans in mushrooms depends on the species, growth environment, and mushroom maturity. Beta-glucans isolated from macrofungi are considered to be natural modifiers of immune response, i.e., biological response modifiers (BMR). The beta-glucan molecules of the individual mushroom species differ in the structure of the backbone, the number and type of chemical bonds, as well as the type and number of side chains, structure (e.g., triple helix, single helix or random helix) and molecular weight. According to current knowledge the conformation of the Î²-glucans is a determining factor of their bioactivity [
