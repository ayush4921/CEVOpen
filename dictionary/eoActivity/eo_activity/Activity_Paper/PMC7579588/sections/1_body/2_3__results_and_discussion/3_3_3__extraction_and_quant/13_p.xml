<p>In our study, the much simpler and cheaper Congo red method was used, which according to Nitschke et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] allows to detect the triple-helix conformation of β-glucans by examining the visible spectrum of its complex with dye [

 <xref rid="B35-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The Congo red method was used for determination of triple helical glucan structure because of its proven interaction with triple helical structures of beta-glucan without the need of extensive clean–up [

 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], which used advanced NMR research techniques, confirms that the Congo red colorimetric assay indicates tridimensional conformation in mushrooms beta-glucans [
