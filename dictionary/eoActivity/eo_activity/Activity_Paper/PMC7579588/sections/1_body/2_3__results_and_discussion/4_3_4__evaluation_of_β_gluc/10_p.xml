<p>The content of β-glucans in the fruiting bodies of commercial species with proven medicinal properties largely depends on the growing conditions, the type of substrate and the mycelium strain used. This allows to control to some extent the content of these compounds in the final product [

 <xref rid="B83-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Few publications report on experiments to enrich the fruiting bodies of cultivated mushrooms with β-glucans. In the research of Park et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], whose aim was to obtain cultivated mushrooms with a higher content of β-glucans, a solution of enzymes (chitinase, β-glucuronidase, and other lytic enzymes) was applied to the mycelium and the fruiting bodies of 
 <italic>Sparassis</italic> mushrooms, which initiated elicitation in the cell walls. This reaction in turn contributed to an increase in β-glucan content in strains of cultivated fungi of the 
 <italic>Sparassis crispa</italic> species (now 
 <italic>Sparassis latifolia</italic>). The authors proposed the use of elicitation as a method of obtaining edible mushrooms of greater medical significance [

 <italic>Sparassis crispa</italic>) has been the subject of Japanese studies [
 <xref rid="B84-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. The results obtained by the Japanese team confirm the therapeutic properties of the 
 <italic>Sparassis crispa</italic> in oral use. It has been shown that the main component responsible for the properties of this species are β-glucans, the content of which in the studied fruiting bodies of mushrooms was determined to be more than three times higher [
 <xref rid="B84-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>] compared to the content of β-glucans in 
 <italic>Pleurotus ostreatus</italic> from own research (

 <italic>Sparassis crispa</italic> glucan) [
