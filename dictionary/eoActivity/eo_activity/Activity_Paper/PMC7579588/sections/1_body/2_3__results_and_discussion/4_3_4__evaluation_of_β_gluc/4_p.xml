<p>Earlier studies have shown that β-glucans are the leading biologically active compounds of medicinal mushrooms [

 <xref rid="B71-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. It was found that the β-glucan content in the fruiting bodies of mushrooms grown in a controlled environment [

 <xref rid="B67-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], may depend on the species, substrate components, environmental conditions and even mycelium strains obtained from various in vitro cultures [

 <xref rid="B56-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Therefore, we studied wild mushrooms to compare them with cultivated species. A comparable content of β-glucans assayed by the Megazyme method in wild and cultivated mushrooms was found, and a higher content (but without confirmed statistical significance) of β-glucans determined by Congo red method in wild grown mushrooms was found (
