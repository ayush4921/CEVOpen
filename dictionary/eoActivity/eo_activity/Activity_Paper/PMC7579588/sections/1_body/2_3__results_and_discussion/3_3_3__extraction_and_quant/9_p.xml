<p>In our study, an enzymatic method Megazyme [
 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] was used to assess the β-glucans content in mushrooms and the results obtained (
 <xref rid="ijerph-17-07299-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) were similar to those presented by other authors who used this method [
 <xref rid="B30-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Much lower β-glucan content was found by Manzi et al. [
 <xref rid="B63-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], which most likely resulted from the presence of chitin attached to the main glucan chain, resulting in accessed of the enzymes to the glucan chain. This assumption can be confirmed by the fact that the β-glucan content of mushroom species in the Manzi et al. study increased significantly after thermal treatment, which most probably contributed to the partial degradation of bonds between chitin particles and glucan chains [
 <xref rid="B63-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. As stated by other authors, the Megazyme method seems to give higher results compared to other methods [
 <xref rid="B55-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,
 <xref rid="B64-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>].
