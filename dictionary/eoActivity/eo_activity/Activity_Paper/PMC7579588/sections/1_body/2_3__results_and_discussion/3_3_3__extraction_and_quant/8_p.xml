<p>The spectrophotometric enzymatic method was developed by McCleary and Holmes [
 <xref rid="B59-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. It is based on enzymatic hydrolysis of polysaccharides to release 
 <sc>d</sc>-glucose and determination of its content by spectrophotometric method. It was first applied for the determination of β-glucans in cereal grains by McCleary and Holmes [
 <xref rid="B59-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. After slight modification by Manzi and Pizzoferrato [
 <xref rid="B60-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], it was used for the determination of β-glucans in fungi. In later years, the determination of β-glucan content by enzymatic method in fungi was carried out by Bak et al. [
 <xref rid="B61-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], Cha et al. [
 <xref rid="B53-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], and Kang et al. [
 <xref rid="B54-ijerph-17-07299" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. This enzymatic method with modifications is currently recommended by the American Association for Clinical Chemistry (AACC). It allows for accurate and precise determination of polysaccharides and indirect (computational) assessment of β-glucan content. The β-glucan content is calculated from the difference between total glucans (α-glucans + β-glucans) and α-glucans. The method can be used for the determination of both linear and branched β-glucans. It can also be used to assess the β-glucan content in the presence of other polysaccharides, i.e., α-glucans or cellulose [
