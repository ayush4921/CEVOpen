<p>The Megazyme method allows to assess the total content of branched and non-branched glucan particles. The method consists of the hydrolysis of polysaccharides to the basic

Therefore, for these compounds, the method of triple extraction with aqueous solutions of alkalia and acids according to Nitschke et al. [
