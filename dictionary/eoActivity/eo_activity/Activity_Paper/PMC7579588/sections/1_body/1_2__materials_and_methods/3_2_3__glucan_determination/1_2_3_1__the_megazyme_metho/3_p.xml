<p>Absorbance measurements for the tested samples were performed using UV-1800 Shimadzu spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Absorbance was converted into Î¼g of 
 <sc>d</sc>-glucose using conversion factor (F), calculated according to the instructions in the kit. A detailed description of glucan determination was published previously in [
