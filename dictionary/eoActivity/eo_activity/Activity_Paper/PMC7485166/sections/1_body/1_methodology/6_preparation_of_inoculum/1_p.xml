<p>The 28 g of the nutrient agar were weighed and taken in the 1000 mL of distilled water, warmed continually until appearance of bubbles followed by sterilization at 121 
 <sup>o</sup>C as well as 15 psi in an autoclave for a period of 15 minutes. Bacterial inoculums have been prepared on the nutrient agar from a 24 h pure culture. The 8 g of the nutrient broth were taken in 1 liter of the distilled water, dissolved and then sterilized in an autoclave at 121 
 <sup>o</sup>C as well as 15 psi for a period of 20 minutes. In a conical flask, 50 ÂµL of culture stock solution was added in 50 mL of broth solution followed by the shaking over a horizontal shaker. Then spectroscopically the cell turbidity was measured after the duration of 24 h and compared to that of the 0.5 McFarland standards. After that, inoculum was ready in order to use for antibacterial activity.
