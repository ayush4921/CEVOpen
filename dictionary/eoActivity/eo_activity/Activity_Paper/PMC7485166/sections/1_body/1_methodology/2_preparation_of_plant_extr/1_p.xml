<p>We used leaves of Azin or barg-e-neem and Lain or barg-e-hena, whole plant of Fuin or shahtra, and flowers of Spin or gul mundi for extraction. The herbal extract formulation was prepared at Faculty of Eastern Medicine, Hamdard University, Karachi. Herbs were washed, dried in air, and processed by continuous extractions.
