<p>Human skin keratinocytes HaCaT cell line was procured from the Human Sciences Research Resources Bank (Japan Human Sciences Foundation, Tokyo, Japan). These cells were preserved in Dalbeccos Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM)-low glucose (Wako, Osaka, Japan) and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) was added with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> humidified air at 37Â°C. After that, these cells were sub-cultured regularly for the experiments. Eczegone was dissolved in DMSO and then, finally it was utilized to make the desired indicated concentrations. The amount of DMSO in each samplewas kept less than 0.01%, and HaCaT cells were treated with increasing concentrations of Eczegone.
