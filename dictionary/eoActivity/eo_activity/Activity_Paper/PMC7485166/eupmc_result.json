    "The present study was conducted to evaluate the antibacterial activity, <i>in vit</i>ro and <i>in vivo</i> cytotoxicity, cell viability and safety of Eastern Medicine coded medicinal formulation Eczegone comprising extracts of <i>Azadirachta indica</i> (Azin)<i>, Fumaria indica</i> (Fuin)<i>, Sphaeranthus indicus</i> (Spin) and <i>Lawsonia inermis</i> (Lain). This work also evaluated antibacterial activity of Eczegone formulation having above mentioned plants ethanolic extracts against different bacteria's by disk diffusion method. <i>In vitro</i> toxicity of Eczegone formulation was investigated by using human skin keratinocytes HaCaT cell line, crystal violet stained cells, and methyl tetrazolium cytotoxicity (MTT) assay. <i>In vivo</i> acute oral and dermal cytotoxicity was determined by using Swiss albino mice and albino rabbits, respectively. The Eczegone formulation showed antibacterial activity against 3 gram negative bacteria including <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Klebsiella pneumonia</i>, <i>Proteus vulgaris</i> and a gram positive <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. We didn't observe any toxic effect of Eczegone formulation on the skin keratinocytes. Furthermore, the Ezcegone formulation was non-irritant according to draize score (OECD TG404, 2002). After rigorous safety evaluation by <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> acute oral and dermal toxicity analysis, we concluded that Eczegone formualtion possessses antibacterial effects and is safe, non-toxic, non-irritant, and the drug would be subjected for further biochemical and clinical studies."
