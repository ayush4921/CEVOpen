<p>We next performed a histological analysis by performing H&amp;E staining. As shown in Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4(a)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4(b)</xref>, 4% DSS treatment induced an inflammatory response that affected colonic architecture, cell infiltration, crypt shortening or loss, and goblet cell depletion. Administration of Combretin A (50 mg/kg), Combretin B (50 mg/kg), and prednisolone (4 mg/kg) significantly reduced the number of infiltrating cells, mucosal injury, and bleeding.
