<p>Regarding the length of the colon, we found that the colon was significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) shorter in the negative control than in the normal control. Interestingly, treatment with Combretin A and B (50 mg/kg, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and prednisolone (4 mg/kg, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) prevented the shortening of the colon significantly (
