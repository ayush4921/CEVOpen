<p>The anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, followed by the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> anticolitic properties of Combretine A and B, were demonstrated in this study. The anti-inflammatory potentials of Combretin A and Combretin B were clearly described in the test for inhibition of denaturation of proteins, cyclooxygenase, and 5-lipoxygenase. The potential for trapping antioxidants and free radicals is clearly revealed in the DPPH, ABTS
 <sup>â€¢+</sup>, power reduction, and nitric oxide trapping tests. We have shown that Combretin A and Combretin B exert an inhibitory effect on the pathogenesis of colitis, improving colon shortening, body weight, DAI, and histopathological scores in mice with DSS-induced colitis.
