<p>Many cytokines such as TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, IL-6, and IL-1
 <italic>β</italic> play a key role in the pathogenicity of inflammatory bowel disease, in regulating inflammation of the intestinal mucosa, and in the integrity of the intestinal epithelium [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In addition, in people suffering from ulcerative colitis, the levels of TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, IL-6, and IL-1
 <italic>β</italic> are greatly increased in the mucosa and serum [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Several studies have also shown that COX-2 expression is significantly elevated in animals with ulcerative colitis [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In addition, COX-2 and iNOS, known as inducible enzymes expressed rapidly by mononuclear macrophages, fibroblasts, or other cells after being stimulated in the body, are closely associated with the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. When iNOS and COX-2 are excessively released, oxidative damage can occur [
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Likewise, ulcerative colitis is a peroxidative disease of the colon, and there are many intestinal pathological changes associated with the colitis process [
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Oxidative stress is a response of the body stimulated by DSS. It can suppress endogenous defense systems that regulate the production of ROS [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. High levels of ROS would have caused oxidative stress and DNA damage due to an imbalance between innate and exogenous antioxidants and ROS [
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. For these different reasons, several studies have shown that the regulation of these different pathways can be a solution for new therapeutic approaches against ulcerative colitis; thus, resveratrol exerts its effect against ulcerative colitis by increasing the expression of the SIRT1 gene, inducing the drop in the expression of p-IkB
 <italic>α</italic> as well as of COX-2 [
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], while proto-catechic acid inhibits the production of inflammatory cytokines as well as COX-2 and iNOS to relieve patients with ulcerative colitis [
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In previous studies, Combretin A and Combretin B have shown their ability to inhibit the production of NO, TNF alpha, and ROS, as well as their immunomodulatory properties [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], while in the present study, Combretin A and B have shown anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. These results suggest that the effect of Combretin A and Combretin B against DSS-induced ulcerative colitis may be closely associated with their regulatory effect on inflammatory cytokines, iNOS activity, COX-2 expression, ROS, and the antioxidant system.
