 <bold>Assay of Cyclooxygenase</bold>. Cyclooxygenase assay was performed using Tris-HCl buffer, enzyme, hemoglobin, and glutathione. To this mixture, arachidonic acid and TCA (10% in 1 N HCl, 0.2 mL) were added and incubated for 20 minutes at 37°C. Then, to the mixture, TBA (0.2 mL) was added and heated in boiling water for 20 minutes. This is then cooled and centrifuged for 3 minutes at 1000 rpm. The supernatant was used to measure COX activity at 632 nm [
