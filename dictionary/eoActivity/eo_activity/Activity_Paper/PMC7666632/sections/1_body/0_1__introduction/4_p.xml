<p>In the treatment of inflammatory disorders, a product capable of trapping reactive oxygen species, inhibiting the production of cytokines and COX, can be very beneficial. 
 <italic>Combretum fragrans</italic> F. HOFFM (Combretaceae), a plant containing several classes of compounds such as saponins, steroids, flavonoids, triterpenes, and tannins [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], is used in Africa to treat diarrhea, leprosy, pain, cough, inflammation, and chronic diabetic wounds. Two cycloartane-type triterpenes named Combretin A and Combretin B were isolated from the leaves of this species and showed 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> inhibitory properties for the production of NO, TNF alpha, ROS, and immunomodulatory properties; they also showed analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antihypernociceptive, and neuroprotective properties [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, the ability of Combretin A and Combretin B to inhibit the onset of symptoms of DSS-induced colitis has not been studied. The results of our previous work prompted us to check whether Combretin A and Combretin B could have anti-inflammatory activity in the model of DSS-induced ulcerative colitis in mice.
