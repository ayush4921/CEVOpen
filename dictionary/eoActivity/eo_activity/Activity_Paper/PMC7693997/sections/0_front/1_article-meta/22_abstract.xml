  <italic>Populus nigra</italic> L. (Salicaceae family) is one of the most popular trees that can be found in deciduous forests. Some particularities that characterize the 
  <italic>Populus</italic> genus refer to the fact that it includes more than 40 species, being widespread especially in Europe and Asia. Many residues, parts of this tree can be used as a bioresource for different extracts as active ingredients in pharmaceuticals next to multiple benefits in many areas of medicine. The present review discusses the latest findings regarding the phytochemical composition and the therapeutic properties of 
  <italic>Populus nigra</italic> L. buds. The vegetal product has been described mainly to contain phenolic compounds (phenols, phenolic acids and phenylpropanoids), terpenoids (mono and sesquiterpenoids), flavones (e.g., apigenol and crysin), flavanones (e.g., pinocembrin and pinostrombin), caffeic/ferulic acids and their derivates, and more than 48 phytocompounds in the essential oils. The resinous exudates present on the buds have been the major plant source used by bees to form propolis. Several studies depicted its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antifungal, antidiabetic, antitumor, hepatoprotective, hypouricemic properties and its effects on melanin production. All these lead to the conclusion that black poplar buds are a valuable and important source of bioactive compounds responsible for a wide range of therapeutic uses, being a promising candidate as a complementary and/or alternative source for a large number of health problems. The aim of the review is to gather the existing information and to bring an up to date regarding the phytochemical and therapeutic uses of 
  <italic>Populus nigra</italic> L. buds.
