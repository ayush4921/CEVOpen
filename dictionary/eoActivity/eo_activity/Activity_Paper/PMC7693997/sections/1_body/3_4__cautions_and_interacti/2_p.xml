<p>Due to the presence of salicylic compounds in 
 <italic>Populus nigra</italic> L., the use of other salicylate preparations should be avoided. Additionally, the coadministration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can lead to increased plasma levels of NSAIDs and thus, high toxicity causing especially gastric and renal problems. Association of salicylates with coumarin anticoagulants raises the risk of bleeding. Moreover, their coadministration with hypoglycemic sulfonamides (e.g., glicazide) could enhance the risk of hypoglycemia. Association of salicylates with activated charcoal can decrease the absorption of salicylates, while the coadministration of antacids can decrease the effects of the salicylates. It was found that combining salicylates with uricosuric agents will decrease the uricosuric effect and enhance the uric acid production, while the coadministration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., escitalopram and fluoxetine) or with tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline) will lead to an increased risk of bleeding. Thus, all these associations need to be avoided. An increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding was observed when salicylates were taken with alcohol, NSAID or corticosteroid treatment. Moreover, when associated with antihypertensive agents, salicylates will decrease the hypotensive effect, leading to high blood pressure levels [
