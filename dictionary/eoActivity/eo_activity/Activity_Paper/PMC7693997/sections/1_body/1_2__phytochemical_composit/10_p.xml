<p>Black poplar buds are rich in phenols, mainly flavonoids and phenylpropanoids and their esters [

 <xref rid="B27-plants-09-01464" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], for example, the organic compound benzyl benzoate, which is present in the majority of poplar type propolis samples, is not detected in the volatile oils of poplar buds [

 <sup>Â®</sup>-MS analysis is an extremely important analytical method for the appropriate identification of several valuable metabolites present in propolis samples and that NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) could provide additional information concerning isomeric compounds, which should be identified [
