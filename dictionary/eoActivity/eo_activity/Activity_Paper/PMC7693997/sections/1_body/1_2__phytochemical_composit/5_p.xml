<p>Nassima and coworkers identified phenolic compounds in methanolic extracts and ethyl acetate fraction of 
 <italic>Populus nigra</italic> L. buds (Ouzou, Algeria). Both extracts revealed a difference regarding the phenolic composition of the screened samples. Phytocompounds such as myrcitrin, luteolin7-O-glucoside, luteolin and apigenin were found only in ethyl acetate fraction in the amount of 13.42 mg/g of residue, 39.86 mg/g of residue, 10.81 mg/g of residue and respective 1.12 mg/g of residue. Both extracts contained ellagic acid, kaempferol and p-coumaric acid, although the highest concentration was observed for the ethyl acetate fraction. Rosmarinic acid and quercetin were only detected in the methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>Populus nigra</italic> L. buds in the amount of 14.46 mg/g of residue and respective 2.07 mg/g of residue [
