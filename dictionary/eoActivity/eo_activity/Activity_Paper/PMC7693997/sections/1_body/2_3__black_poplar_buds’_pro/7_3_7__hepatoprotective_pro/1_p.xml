<p>The first attempt to study the hepatoprotective effect (

 <italic>Populus nigra</italic> L. buds (Province of Amizour, Algeria) belonged to Debbache-Benaida et al. They studied in vivo on Albino mice, the protective effect of ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>Populus nigra</italic> L. (200 mg/kg) against aluminum-induced hepatic toxicity. Histopathologic analysis of treated liver sections revealed normal hepatic architecture. Moreover, the extract protected almost completely the liver against AlCl3-induced hepatic damage and necrosis. This fact can be explained due to the inhibition of Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> influx and/or radical scavenging activity [
