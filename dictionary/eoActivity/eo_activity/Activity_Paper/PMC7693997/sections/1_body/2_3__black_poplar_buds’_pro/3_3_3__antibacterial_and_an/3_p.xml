<p>Debbache et al., tested the potential antifungal activity of 4 types of extracts (ethanol, aqueous ethyl acetate, chloroform and aqueous chloroform) from poplar buds (Province of Amizour, Algeria) on 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> and 
 <italic>Fusarium polyferatum</italic>. Results evaluated by measuring inhibition zones surrounding plant extracts showed that all screened extracts elicit moderate activity against fungal strains (inhibition zones between 6 and 9 mm) [
