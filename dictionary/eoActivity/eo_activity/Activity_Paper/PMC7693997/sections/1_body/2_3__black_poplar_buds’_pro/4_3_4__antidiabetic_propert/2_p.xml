<p>Liu et al., investigated in vitro the effects of pinocembrin, galangin, chrysin and pinobanksin from propolis on insulin resistance and Akt/mTOR signaling using insulin resistant HepG2 cells by an immunoassay. Results showed that only galangin (80 µM) and pinocembrin (4 µM) could increase glucose consumption and glycogen content by enhancing the activities of pyruvate kinase. Moreover, pinocembrin and galangin have elicited synergistic effects on the improvement of insulin resistance [
