<p>The emergence of infectious diseases worldwide due to bacteria and viruses still poses a serious public health concern, claiming the lives of half a million people a year and amounting to 25% of the total deaths worldwide [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Even with the discovery and production of new and improved antibiotics, the resistance of pathogenic microorganisms to drugs has increased enormously [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Ventola [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] indicated that the causes of antibiotic resistance include overuse, inappropriate prescribing, and extensive agricultural use. There is, therefore, an imminent need to discover and develop new drugs to combat antimicrobial resistance [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared that antibiotic resistance is a global public health concern, claiming that there are at least 700,000 annual deaths globally [

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Novel therapies ought to be discovered to combat antimicrobial resistance [
