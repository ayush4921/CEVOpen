<p>Endophytes have been reported from different plant species and plant parts, in various geographical locations and diverse environmental conditions [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Endophytes inhabit their host plants; they improve drought tolerance and produce protective compounds which protect host plants from biotic and abiotic factors [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Furthermore, Dembitsky [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] reported that endophytes produce bioactive secondary metabolites, such as alkaloids and lactones that display antimicrobial and anticancer properties. These bioactive compounds could be explored further for medical, agricultural, and pharmaceuticals use [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Endophytes inhabit unique biological niches growing in uncommon environments, and their isolation and identification are vital for further exploration [
