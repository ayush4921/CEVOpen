<p>The study revealed the presence and cohabitating of endophytic bacteria from leaves of 
 <italic>C. macowanii,</italic> and this has informed us of the microbial community of 
 <italic>C. macowanii</italic>. Crude endophyte extracts displayed notable inhibitory activities against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial species. Crude extracts endophytes (
 <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic> and 
 <italic>Bacillus safensis</italic>) exhibited promising anticancer activity against lung cancer. The identified secondary metabolites from the endophytes have reported biological activities, and this data raises the possibility that the overharvesting of 
 <italic>C. macowanii</italic> for its medicinal properties will be halted. This is a promising lead for drug discovery and bioprospecting. Further extraction of secondary metabolites from endophytes is still needed.
