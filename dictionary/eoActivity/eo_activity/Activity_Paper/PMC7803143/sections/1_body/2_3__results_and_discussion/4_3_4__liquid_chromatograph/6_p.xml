<p>Crinine-type alkaloid crinamidine has been isolated from different plants of the Amaryllidaceae family [
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>] and also from the bulbs, flowering stalks, leaves, and roots of 
 <italic>Crinum macowanii</italic> [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Crinamidine is found in whole plant parts of the 
 <italic>Crinum</italic> species [
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. Powelline is an alkaloid reported to occur in 
 <italic>C. macowanii</italic> [
 <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>] and Ndhlala et al. [
 <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>] reported its occurrence from the bulbs. Both these crinine-type alkaloids have been reported to possess antibacterial, antitumor, and anticancer activity [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. This is not alarming as endophytes can metabolize secondary compounds from the host [
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>] and display a number of biological activities as the host plant.
