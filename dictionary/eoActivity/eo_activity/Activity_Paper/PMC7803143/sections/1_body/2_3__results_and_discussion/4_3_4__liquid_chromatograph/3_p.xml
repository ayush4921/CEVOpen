<p>Lycorine is an alkaloid previously isolated from 
 <italic>C. macowanii</italic> [
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Leaves of 
 <italic>C. macowanii</italic> contain more lycorine as compared to the bulbs and other plant parts such as roots and flowers [
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. Crude endophyte extras of 
 <italic>Bacillus safensis</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas cichorii</italic>, and 
 <italic>Arthrobacter pascens</italic> displayed the presence of lycorine, and this is not surprising as endophytes can metabolize secondary metabolites from the host plant [
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. Lycorine has been reported to possess antibacterial activity and cytotoxic and antitumor activities [
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. This would explain the observed antibacterial and/or anticancer activity of the crude endophyte extracts.
